S.TREASURY,  S.W.3rd April.  1924,
f.Q.01. \J -JTHE CONTROL OF SALES OF ARKS AND AtJUIHITIOH.           Thic question was considered by tho Cabinet in July, 1928, upon a memorandum from the Home Office calling attention to tho risk to issues at homo and abroad involved in the existence of largo floating stocks of munitions of war.   At that timo the Irish troubles woro acuto and a caco had recently occurred where a cargo of riflos (not the property of His Majesty1s Government but of tho Russian Liquidation Committee) for  which an oxport licenco had boon granted was diverted at sea  to a prohibited destination.    On the 26th  July,  1922, the  following decision was given :-           (a)  The  Disposals Board  should be instructed                to refrain from  selling any more  munitions                whether arms or  ammunition,  or explosives,                pending further  instructions:           (b)   The  Government establishments concerned-                should  be  Instructed by tho  Admiralty,               War Offico,  and  Air  Ministry respectively,                to take steps to break up unserviceable  arms                and  ammunition,  whothor surplus or not:           (c)  Servicoablo  arms and ammunition should               be retained:           (d)  The  Servico  Departments and  the Disposals               Board,  in  consultation,  should prepare.ro and               circulate  to  the Cabinet a Memorandum giving               particulars  of tho quantities  of war munitions               still remaining,  including besides small arms,               heavy and  light  guns, machine guns, tanks,               bombs, hand  grenades and ammunition of all               kinds.          On the 4th August, 19 2,a conference between representatives of tho Treasury,, the War Office, and thoDisposal and Liquidation Commission took placo,  and it wasagreed with the approval of the  Chancellor of tho Exchequer thattho following interpretation should bo placed on the Cabinetdeoislon above quotod:-
        Gun ammunition - The existing procedure,        by whiob the. Disposal Board strictly        supervises ita breaking down, should        continue.        Small arms ammunition - Sales of intact        ammunition to be strictly confined to        Dominion and Indian Governments.        Small arcs - Ho further declarations of        surplus to bo made by tho War Office        without Cabinet authority.   Serviceable        rifles to bo disposed of only to tho        Dominion or Indian Govornmoits.         Subsequently it was represented to tho Cabinet(3.P.4180 dated 5th September, 1928) by tho thon  Secretaryof State for Wax, 3ir laming Worthington-3vana, that theterma ol the Cabinet decision of tho 26th July, 1922,  were -        &quot;preventing the completion of certain negotiation         with bona fido armament firms in this country for         the supply of arms and ammunition to allied apa         other Governments&quot;and tho Secretary of State&apos;a memorandum ooncludod as follows:-        &quot;I ask the (Cabinet to allaw tho responsibility         for giving effect to tho policy of tho Cabinet         in the matter of salsa of warlike stores to rest         upon tho Departments concerned, who will oxerciso         their diacretion in referring tho more important         questions concerning the sale of arms to tho         Cabinet.   I accordingly proposo to,a*t  in this         way unless there is any objection on the part of         my colleagues.&quot;       On tho 7th September, 1922, the- Cabinet decided -         &quot;that tho responsibility for giving effect to the          policy of tho Government in the matter  of sale of          warlike stores should re3t upon the Departments          ooncorned who should be authorised to carry out           negotiations for tho sale of such stores to          foreign powers&quot; in proper oases as suggested  in          the memorandum of tho Secretary of State for          War,. CP. 4100, and that Departments should          exerciso their discretion in referring  to the          Cabinet the more important questions concerning          the sale of arms.&quot;        In accordance with this decision,  tho Disposal and liquidation Commission and Admiralty,  and tho War Officer-                                                      haveThe Air Ministry have had  no  negotiations  with Foreign Countries,and have only sold small quantities  for  breaking down in thiscountry. (a)&quot;(b) (o)
have tarried out negotiations for sale of armament stores ofail kinds, to foreign powers  in proper cases, subject to thenecessary precautions being  taken to secure that tho armamentdid not get into improper hands.          For the export of  arms and anmunition (other thansporting arms and ammunition) a Board of Trado export licenceia necessary, arid that Department does not issue such a licence for exportation to any foreign destination of any substantial quantities unless and until  it has communicated with thoforeign Offioe and the Foreign Office is satisfied not only that there is no objection of polloy to tho sale to thacountry designated,  but also after enquiry that tho export iabeing genuinely made to that country.   The Board of trade also make reference before giving such a licence to theServioe Department concerned.          The Disposal and liquidation Commission take thoprecaution of communicating  any proposed sales of armament tothe War Office and to the1 Police Authorities at Scotland Yard,with a view to being satisfied as to the bona fides of theintenfl ing purchasers.   The Admiralty and War Office follow the 3:.the  procedure when they are in doubt as to tho anto-cedenta of the- intending purchasers.                                                  InIn the  case of  export to  certain specified  destinations,  tho  Board act on  standing  instructions  received  from tho  Foreign  Office,  for example, no licence is  issued at present  for  exportation to China or Russian
          In certain oases sales have been made to Britishagents, who, in every oaoe, hold licences to doal in arms,and who re-sell to foreign Governments, such re-sale being subjected to the preoautions mentioned abovo before an expertlicence is given.&apos;  For the sales which have been made ainooSeptember, 1922, these precautions appear to Lava beeneffective, and tho Disposal and liquidation Commission andthe other selling departments have no knowledge of any of the armament having got into improper or uhdosirablo hands,          There has recently boon received a proposal by a firm of licensed dealers in arms, named Messrs. A. Fleming&amp; Company,5 of 70, Upper Thames Street, London, E.O. 4. for thepurchase :,f or  110,500 (cash) from tho Disposal and liquidation-tion Commission of approximately 120,000 rifles of variouspatterns, (including 17,000 Japaneso rifles and 42,000Ross rifles) and about 160,000,000 rounds of small armammunition and various components - this being the remainder ofthoir small arms stock.   The firm arc purchasing with aview to resale to tho Baltic States of Esthonia,Latvia and Lithuania.         &apos; The sale was proposed by tho Disposal and LiquidationCommission to be made on the basis that the arms  and ammunition                                                            should be moved from the Army, Hayy and other Government dopotsin which they now lie, to two depots belonging to the Disposaland Liquidation Commission, where thoy woro to bo guarded inaccordance with such regulations as shall bo laid down by thoDisposal and Liquidation Coamission.  Sihlo praotico is alwaysfollowed on any considerable sale to Agents by tho DisposalCommission.                                       \l               Tho
            The War Office concurred in the proposed sale, but  when  the matter was brought to the notico of the Police  Authorities at Scotland Yard they referred It to tho Homo  Office.   That Department being still somewhat disquieted as to  tho general position and having recently had evidence through  polioo channels and also in tho course of the administration  of the Aliens Regulations of clandestine negotiations for the  purchase of arms, apparently for Russia, have suggested that  Cabinet directions should bo obtained.          It should be mado cloar at this atago that while there  are arguments for and against permitting the sale of arms for  cash  there are in the viow of tho Treasury overwhelming ob-  joationa to permitting any transaction which involves directly  or indirectly tho granting of credit by tho British Government.           An embargo by tho British Government on the sale of  surplus arms for cash would have a moral rather than a prac-  tical significanco for there are many alternative sources of  supply.   A refusal to grant credit on tho other hand is  offectivo.  We may think a country like Lithuania ill-advised  to incur heavy expenditure for armaments,  but if sho has to  pay cash down she will not spend enough to ruin herself, tho  damago is limited to her having, spout on arms money whioh  could more profitably havo been spent in other directions.  Even if she finds private lenders,  they will  not lend hor  muoh and the terms they will ask will soon put a stop to hor  borrowing.   Whoro olso could sho get monoy ?  Poland and  Serbia have obtained loans from tho French Government for&quot;  munitions, a transaction which called forth a strong protest  from Groat Britain.    It is  not in  tho least  likely that  Pranoo will want to  repeat that experiments                                                      But
                                                          1 ft A                                                          J:  Li.&apos;         But should the British Government grant credit,the position is very different.       The borrowing country willspend on non-reproductive purposes every penny she can gethold of.    The security for her older loans,  largely from great Britain,  will vanish and when the time comes to repay the new loan it will be found that she cannot and that the lender must lose the money.      Even should she show a degreeof honesty beyond that usually displayed by borrowingGovernments, she is more likely to destroy her economic andfinancial structure in the effort to repay than actually tteffect repayment&apos;.         Accordingly the Treasury have felt it necessarystrongly to oppose recent schemes for supplying arms to theBaltic States.     The requirements of these countries forwarlike stores,, as stated by themselves, amount to &apos;         Lithuania      -    6,OOO,000         Latvia         -    3,600,000         Estonia        -    1,500,000 (or  6,000,000 if                                        she adopts British                                        equipments).These figures are fantastically beyond the economic strengthof theee countries but, whatever the amount, the treasury are altogether opposed in principle to the grant of creditat all.      Parliament has expressly forbidden the treasury to guarantee credits under the Trade Facilities Act andSxport Credit legislation for purposes connected with thesupply of munitions.    What reception is likely to be givento a Vote for diverting the taxpayers1 money to this purposeor even to a new Bill, authorising the Treasury to give aGovernment guarantee to credits  raised privately?          The Treasury accordingly submit that the grantof credits should be ruled out definitely and at once.                                                    To                                            %
        To return to the Fleming transactions the following considerations in favour of this sale may ho noted.     1.   The War Office consider it important that foreignArmies should purchase munitions of British, rather than offoreign pattern so that the;/ would have to come here forreplacements and spare parts,  orders for which would tend topromote employment.    Moreover the dependence of the foreign states on us for Arms would give ue some hold over them inmatters of policy.     2.   The Foreign Office raise no objection of foreignpfiiicy to the supply of Arms for the use of the Baltic states to the extent necessary to enable them to preserve nationalindependence.     3.   The sale of surplus or ebsdescent small arras will realise over . 100,000.      The only alternatives are storagefor an indefinite time or break-up of the stocks, both ofwhich involve expenditure.     4.   If the arms are not purchased from the BritishGovernment there are many alternative sources of supply, heroand abroad,  from which the Baltic Governments could obtain armson a moderate 3calc for cash.     5.   If British armament firms are not prohibited frommanufacturing arms for export to foreign countries it might appear illogical and is certainly expensive to prohibitsales from surplus Government stocks under proper precautions.To prohibit manufacture by armament firms would leave thecountry without a reserve of firms to fall back on in caseof war, and if the manufacturers of a foreign country areto be under no similar restriction its capacity for output in emergency would by correspondingly strengthened.
                                                         1                                                         JL (J J         In these circumstances if the armament firms wcroprohibited from accepting foreign orders they would unlesssubsidized bo driven to make considerable reductions in theirmunitions plant, and subsidies although they would preventthe dispersal of plant would not enable the firms to keep their Designing and Technical staffs efficient.         On the other hand there is a risk that notwith-standing all precautions the arms may get into undesirablehands, and as already noted, the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is to promote the financial reconstruction ofEurope and to discourage excessive expenditure on armamentsby struggling states which cannot afford it.         A copy.of the authorisation of Mr-Fleming by the lithuanian Government is attached.         As a private armament firm in this country would no doubt be authorised to sell arms to him, there seems noreason why a Government department should not likewise do so.The same restriction, i.e. that Government Departments shouldnot be per-iiitted to sell except to persons to whoa private firms would be authorised to sell, might reasonably be made ofgeneral application.         A similar case arises in connection with anapplication from Persia.    The Persian Prime Minister has put forward a request through the British Minister at Teheranto be allowed to purchase 20,000 modern British Lee infieldrifles.    He stated that if His Majesty&apos;s Government refusedhe would buy from French, Belgian or Italians who were allanxious to sell, but ha wanted to obtain British arms.   Thewar Office are  in a position to supply.    The Persian Govern-ment  is heavily indebted to His Majesty&apos;s Government but has                                                 shown
shown no disposition to honour itB debt;    ITo credit would ofcourse be given, and payment in cash would be insisted on.  TheChancellor of the Exchequer has directed that Cabinet decisionon the general question of sale of arms by Governmentdepcrt-ments to Foreign Governments should first be obtained.     TheForeign Office state that there is no immediate likelihood ofarms supplied to the Persian Government falling into unauthorisedhands, the Persian army being more efficient now than at any period in recent times.    As a matter of fact it seems likely that the Persian Government have now filled their requirements from other sources.    It is three months since their applicationwas made, and they arc known to have cancelled a recent purchaseof &quot;303 amjmnition.
