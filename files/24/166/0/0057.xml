My colleagues may wish to  have  a summary of thevoluminous Reports of  the Reparation Expert Committees.I circulate therefore  a brief note prepared in the Treasury.P. S.TREASURY. S.W.   15th. April. 1954.
              RSrORTS OP TESffl-t-ERT COMMITTEES.          The Expert Committees were appointed by theReparation Commission to consider respectively     First Committee (&quot;The Pases Committee&quot;),  the means ofbalancing the budget of Germany and the measures to be. ta:v:ento stabilise its currency:     Second Committee (&apos;&apos;The MciSenna Committee&quot;), the amount ofGerman  exported capital and the means of bringing it bad;: toGermany.          The reports have b^en laid before Parliament (Cmd.2105)and the references  below are to the pages of that document.              HSrOhT OF T.-..E McivSitaA COMMITTEE.          This Committee disposes of the legend of enormous                            at &apos;German  foreign balances by estimating these balances as onDecember 51,1925 (since when they must have been considerably reduced)  at  557,500,000.    This sum includes  investments in real property and other immoveables which must be considerable.          The Committee pours scorn on attempts to control teeexport  of this capital from Germany and points out that theonly way to eet it  within German taxation is to rehabilitateGermany,  so that Germans will v?ish to hold their money  in theirown stabilised currency.             REPORT OF THE PAvvES CpkfelTT^S.1 -   The Ruhr.          Almost at the beginning of the Report (p.13)  comesthe Important declaration that the Committee are unable to find any practical means of ensuring permanent stability  in budget and                                                      currency
currency in Germany as she actually is at the present moment,with limitations as to her fiscal and economic rights over partof her area.   Economic activity must be unhampered and unafftcted by any foreign organisation ether than the controls provided intiie Committee&apos;s scheme.          Thus the Committee - while they do not deal with military occupation which was outside their terms of reference -clearly indicates, that as a necessary preliminary to their scheme the whole cf the organisation set up by Prance andBelgium to exploit the Buhr and Rhineland must disappear.          Later in the report (p .42) they repeat that their plan is strictly dependent upon the. restoration of Germany&apos;economic sovereignty and add that the operation of their plan will be proportionately postponed if there is a delay ineffecting that restoration.          If, however, their plan be adopted, in the case offlagrant failure to fulfil the conditions accepted by commonagreement,  it is for the Creditor Governments, as joint trusteesfor themselves and persons who have lent money on the faith cfthe scheme, then to determine the nature of the Sanctions tobe applied...and the method of their rapid and effectiveapplication (p .14) .2 .   Germ. &amp;n Curr en cy .          After noting that the two problems of Budget andcurrency are interdepentent, the Committee set out theircurrency plan (p.15).   A new bansc is to be set up with a capital of  20 millions, part to be subscribed in Germany andpert abroad.   It is to have the sole right to issue currency in                                                 Germany
Germany for 50 years and to take over existing  currencies.   the notes of the Bank are intended ultimately to be convertible intogold but actual convertibility will hot be established at the outset,   v.&apos;ith a view, however, to keeping the  notes stable inrelation to gold there -.:Ill be restrictions on  the note  issue and a compulsory reserve of 33.1 /. in gold or in the form ofdeposits in foreign banter.   A special foreign  commissioner will be appointed to ensure the observance of these statutory provisions.     The &quot;bank is to be administered by a Germ an president anda German managing board alongside which there is another boardcalled the &quot;GeneralBoard&quot; of 7 Germans and 7 foreigners (British,&quot;French. Italian, Belgian, American, Dutch and Swiss) with&quot;broadpowers in such matters cf bank organisation and operation as might affect the interests of the creditor nations&apos; .     For the rest, the bank is to have the normal functions ofa central bank, e g  establishing the official  rate of discount.It is to be the fiscal agent of the German Government and               will hold the sums collected for reparationpurposes.3,   11 Basic principles of Germany&apos;s Annual Burden&quot; .     Under this head (pages 1B-23) the Committee set out the distinctive features of their scheme-     Starting from the conception that a plan confined to ashort reconstruction period of a fe.? years only is useless,  theCommittee disclaim any intention to settle what total sumGer any can pay but indicate what annuities may be possible from a restored Germany leaving open the question how long the-.                                           %     annuities
annuities a^e to continue.    To fix a figure for the amount ofthe annuity now may involve injustice to the creditor nationsthrough an underestimate of Germany&apos;s capacity.   (The precautionagainst an overestimate will appear later).    Therefore whilefixing the normal annuity starting in 1923/9 at cl25 millionsthe Committee provide for an index by which German prosperitymay be measured and the annuity will be automatically increased if the indications point to increased prosperity,         The Committee then deal with equality of  taxation.&quot;It is not open to dispute as a simple principle of justice and-it is contemplated by the Treaty that the German people should be placed under a burden of taxation at least as heavyas that borne by the people of the Allied countries&quot;.     TheCommittee have done their best to apply this principle (p.20.)          But the Committee emphasise the fact that it is  one thing to collect marks from the German taxpayer and anotherthing to remit the sums so&quot;.obtained abroad.      The extent  towhich siims can be transferred abroad will be limited by the exportable surplus of Germany (including all invisible,  aswell as visible items),       The size of the exportable surplusdepends on a great number of uncertain factors and is incapable of close calculation in advance.      The Committee therefore propose that the funds accruing to the account of  the AlliedGovernments should be utilised,  to such extent as  in theopinion of a Committee of exchange experts to be set up forthis purpose, can be done without risking the stability of the currency        (a) for payments of deliveries in kind and        (b) for purchase of foreign exchange.When the danger point is reached, transfers are to be suspended                                                        and
and the funds kept on deposit or invested in Germany.     If andwhen the total fund as retained in Germany reached  250 millions,the annual payments in German currency to be made in the futureare to be reduced to such an amount as can be remitted without increasing the accumulated fund beyond  250 million.         The &quot;Transfer Committee&apos;  of exchange experts (p.110)is to contain an American,  an Englishman,  a Frenchman,  a Belgian,an Italian and the Agent for Separation Payments - the lastprobably a Frenchman.          The following essential, features of the Committee^plan may be noticed,     (a)  Germany&apos;s liability for all Treaty charges is to be         confined under one head;     there are not to&apos;be separate         liabilities for reparations,  costs of occupation,         clearing office payments&apos; etc.     (b)  The annuity after the reconstruction period is  to be          125 million but may be increased by the automatic         application of an index designed to indicate Germany&apos;s         degree of prosperity.     (c)  Whatever the sum may be,  Germany has to pay it  in         marks not foreign currency.    T?er liability is         apparently gold marks and if  the mark depreciates she         will have to pay year by  year the number of marks         necessary to produce the  amount of the gold liability         at the current rate of exchange.       When she  has done         that however her task is  done.     It is for others to         arrange for remittance abroad.      (d)lf exchange difficulties  prevent remittance abroad,         at first the sums collected are retained in Germany         until the accnamxJations reach  250 millions.         Thereafter - whatever the theoretical annuity may be  -         only so much is to be collected as can be&apos; remitted abroad:;                                                         The
     4.     The Committee (p.32) proposes the following sums as theannual liability of Germany in respect of all Peace.Treatycharges:-                              (plus  40 million from foreign loan)                              (plus or minus  121- million)                                n    it   H     n     II        and thereafter  125 million gold per annum for anindeterminate period,  plus an increase based on an index of prosperity.        The total annual charge in a normal year is to he met out of the following sources (a) Railway Revenue, which will hecharged with a debenture debt of  550 millions in favour of reparations;  (b) Mortgages on industrial properties to a capital value of  250 millions;    (c) produce of the Transport Tax(d) the German Budget - being secured on Customs and Jbccise duties in each case control will be exercised in a different degree by representatives of the Allied Powers:      in the case of theRailways and Industrial Mortgages, through the agency of members on the Board of a private company or a Trustee,  in the case ofthe Revenues by means, of Commissioners or Agents who will actmerely as auditors so long as payments due are regularly met,but who will have power to administer the assigned revenuesdirectly in case of any default.. .                          Foreign Loan.        In addition&apos; to these proposals, which may be talcenas representing the maximum burden which can in the opinionof the Committee be placed upon the Germany economy,  it is1924-5     10 million1925-6     61    &quot;1926-7     60    &quot;1927-8     87    &quot;1928-9    125suggested
suggested that an attempt should be made to raise immediateforeign credits to the amount of  40 million,  so as to bring up the amount available in the first year of the operation ofthe plan from  10 millions to  50 millions, in order to providefor the Armies of Occupation and for the continuance of deliveries in kind  bich certain of the Allied roaers regard asindispensable.    As, however,  the interest and sinking fund onthis loan is intended to be provided out of the annual payments for subsequent years included in the Schedule,  it will,  if raised,not constitute an additional burden on Germany, but be of thenature rather of an anticipatory ^mobilisation&quot; of a small portionof the general reparation debt.
