    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)                      Printed for the Cabinet,    April 1924.SECRET.                                                                       * faCP. 236 (24).                                                                      &quot;  f      I circulate for the information of my colleagues the following reply which  hasbeen received  from the Viceroy to  my telegram of 27th March (Cabinet 23 (24),Conclusion 11.)   The Sub-Committee on Indian Affairs will consider it and report.    4th April 1924.                                                 OLIVIER.                    Telegram from Viceroy, 2nd April 1924.    Private and secret.  Reference your private and secret telegram  No. 999, dated 27th  March.   Certainly I  and my colleagues desire  that  there  should be better understanding between His Majesty&apos;s Government and leaders of Indian opinion, and a contact for this purpose would  be useful, provided that it takes the  right form, otherwise it would merely do harm.  I have not  had the opportunity of consulting my colleagues on your telegram  of 27th, and shall not meet  them for some days. The views I now express are my own, and without consultation  with my Council, but I have not the slightest doubt from  previous discussions  that  they would all agree with  me.   I  take  the  standpoint that,  although it  would be  an advantage if the Swarajists  showed disposition  to be  less  actively hostile  to  the  Government,  I strongly deprecate opening up negotiation with them, while I am equally strongly in favour of inviting representatives  of moderate and independent parties who may be in England to meet the  Prime Minister,  if he  can find  time,  and others of the Cabinet.    My objective  differs  from yours in my  desire to consolidate  all Liberal and independent opinion other than Swarajists, whom it is impossible to  conciliate  save by present concessions, which are unjustifiable.  Special opportunities will occur for informal discussion with Liberals, and Sapru, Sastri and Mrs. Besant are proceeding to England towards the end of the month of April.    Rangachariar and Roy are there already.   Jinnah, of the Independent party, may also he going home.  Of extremists, Lajpat  Rai has already left  for England.  Press states that  Malaviya also is proceeding to  England.   I hope that you will get into discussion with Sastri, Sapru and Mrs. Besant, and also with Jinnah ;  but as regards Swarajists and extremists,  I trust you will wait for move&apos;to come from them.  I have twice  given opportunity to Swarajists to meet  me if they  wished at social functions, which would  have paved the way  for informal political discussion, but they markedly failed to avail themselves  of  these  opportunities.   It would,  therefore, be wholly misunderstood if you issued any invitation to them.    2. The above  are my suggestions for making contact  and better understanding, but I  draw  a distinction between discussions  for this purpose and  discussion for the purpose of negotiation,  direct or indirect, for change in structure of the Constitution.    Any suggestion of  the latter  character  would be likely greatly to embarrass me and my Government, and  to prejudice the enquiry we have undertaken  and  are commencing.7236    100  124
