COMMITTEE ON MEMBERS1 EXPENSES  (RAILWAY  PASSES).                          FINAL  REPORT.      1,   The Committee  held their second meeting at 9.30 pan,      yesterday in the Lord Privy Seal&apos;a Room at the House of      Commons, when there were pre sent:-                  The Lord Privy Seal,                  The Minister of Labour,                  The Minister of Transport,                  The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.     The Secretary of State for the Colonies and the President of.      the Board of Education had communicated their views to the     Lord Privy Seal before the meeting, which they could not     attend.      2.   The Lord Privy Seal informed the Committee that he had      submitted to the Prime Minister the Report (See Appendix)     which had been agreed upon at.their meeting earlier in the day,     and while he had not gone fully into the details of the scheme     he had discussed the more, important of  the recommendations.     The Prime Minister18 view was  that  it would be undesirable to     exceed the estimate  of   70,000  which had been given to the     House if the scheme  could be carried into effect without     doing so.    He felt further that the issue would be     complicated were provision added to the scheme for  the issue     to Members of either season tickets or  vouchers  to  enable     them to visit their  homes as well as their constituencies.     It was upon these two aspects  of the matter ,that the Prime&apos;     Minister desired the further observations of the Committee.
30   At this noil, the  Chief Whip entered, and explained thatas arranged earlier in the evening by the Lord Privy Sealhe had communicated in confidence to the Opposition Whipsthe recommendations put forward by the Committee at their earlier meeting in the form of suggested conditions to beattached to the grant  of Railway facilities.   So far,therefore,  as the Opposition were concerned the Governmentwere in no  way pledged to these proposals, which had only been put forward as a  basis of discussion.   The chief whip informed the Committee that so far as he could see thebulk of the Conservatives would vote against whateverproposals were brought forward, while the bulk of the Liberalswould vote  for any reasonable proposals submitted by theGovernment,4.   After  considerable discussion the Committee came tothe conclusion that if the estimated cost of a scheme putforward by  the Government wore going to exceed the sum of 70,000 advantage of this fact would be taken by many members who were really in favour of the grant of limited railway facilities  either to abstain from voting or even to vote against the proposals.   It would clearly be idle to put&apos;forward a scheme of a  kind more ambitious than the House wouldbe likely to sanction, and for this reason the committee decided to examine their earlier recommendations on the basis that in no case the cost should exceed  70,000.5,   The Committee then heard a statement from Mr. Hurcomb,of the Ministry of Transport, in regard to the basis uponwhich tho estimate of  70,000 and that of  90,000 had been
     based..   It was explained that the former estimate was on     the  season ticket basis to constituencies only, whilo the      90,000 figure, which wag of a far more speoulativo     character, had besn reached, on the following assumptions, (a)     that facilities would be granted for journeys either to the     Member&apos;s homo or Conatitutenoy,  and that (b) on an average eaoh     Member would take one such journey ouoe a weok for 40 weeks     in the course of a year.,   It was felt that probably this     was on the generous side, but it was the basis that had     been adopted by the previous Government when considering  the     matter,   lie suggestion was put forward that Members should     be given an opportunity of seleoting whether thoy should     receive tickets to their homes or to their constituencies,     but apart from ths parliamentary objections to this oourso     it was felt that It would bo impossible to frame  a reasonably     accurate estimate of the cost of suoh a proposal, which would     in any case exceed the figure of  70..000.    2Sie Committee     therefore decided to reoommand that facilities should only     be granted to enable Members to  visit their constituencies.     6,   The Committee decided,  (a)  to substitute the following     recommendations for those submitted in Paragraph  3 of their     earlier Report:-         1,    That the travelling facilities should bo  granted to         all Members of the Rouse and should cover journeys by         rail and steamship between  London and the Member.5s         Constituenoy.         2.    That the facilities should be open to Members for         Suburban Constituencies, provided they travel  by rail.         3.    That ths facilities should 13 available throughout         the year and not merely during thG periods of         Parliamentary Sessions *     (b) to confirm the recommendations submitted in the fourth and     fifth paragraphs of their earlier Report,                          Signed on  behalf of the Committee                                (S4,) J.

At their Meeting on April 7th,  1924,  Cabinet 25(24)  14the Cabinet agreed that the question of Railway Passes for members of Parliament should be remitted to -          The Lord Privy Seal,          Ths Secretary of State for the Colonies,          The Minister of Labour,          The Minister of Education,          The Minister of Transport     who should make recommendations to the Prime     Minister as to the line to be taken by the     Government in regard to the alternatives of     tho grant of season tickets or vouchers, or     a combination of season tickets for the &apos;     snorter journeys and vouchers for the longer     journeys, as well as the question of sleeping     accommodation for Members whose constituencies     involve night journeys:    and     that the Prime Minister, in consultation with     tho above Committee, should have authority     to decide the question on behalf of the Cabinet.2*   The Committee, in consultation with the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury, have fully considered  thequestions remitted to them and submit the following3,   It has been suggested that the travelling facilities and the MemberJs constituency (2)  between London andReportto be provided should cover journeys (l) between london the Member&apos;s home and (3)  between the Members
           Home and his Constituency.  While the Committee are           clearly of opinion that the facilities should cover           (1) and (2) above they consider that  (3) is more           likely to be regarded as controversial.  The Committee           also consider that the value of the proposed concession           will be greatly diminished if the facilities are           restricted to the periods during which Parliament is           actually in Session,                The Committee recommend -                         That the travelling facilities                         should cover journeys by rail between                         London and  the Members Constituency                         and between London and  the member&apos;s                         Home,  but not between the member&apos;s                         Constituency and his Home,                         That the facilities should be open                         to Members  for Suburban Constituencies                         or to  Members who reside in  the Suburbs                         provided that they travel by rail.                         That the facilities should be available .                         throughout  the year and not  merely                         during the periods of Parliamentary                         Sessions.                         That the facilities should be available                         to all Members of Parliament, including                         Ministers of the Crown.SBASOH QJISEB9S 4,  The simplest and in  many respects the most convenient03 VOUCHEES.           arrangement would be to grant Season  Tickets, giving           Vouchers for  each journey to those Members whose sonsti-           constituencies or homes are farthest away and who would only           visit  them occasionally.  On the other hand it  seems           probable that the Voucher system would, in the  long run,           be more  economical unless, indeed, the Hallway  Companies           are prepared  to give Members,Traders&apos; Tickets,  the grant           of which to Members  of Parliament might give rise to           political  and other  difficulties.  The Voucher  system           would  have the advantage of shoMng the precise return(1)or recommen- -tions in 1 Form see .nal ReportP.247A(24)ge 3,)(2)(3)(4)

ST A5Bfor the money expended and  would,  in any oase, haveto be resorted to in cases  where the Member*B homeand constituency are in different parts of thecountry so as to avoid the  serious objections  incidental to tho grant to a Member of two Season Tickets,  oneto his constituency and one to his home,simultaneously.     The Committee recommend&apos;,-           (1)  That the Voucher system should be                adopted experimentally for the                remainder &quot;of the present Darlia-                mentary Session.           (2)  That the Voucher system should be                based on the issue to each Member                of a Book of Vouchers exchangeable                for Ifeiilway Tickets between tho                Metropolis and the member&apos;s                Constituency and home respectively.            (3)  That, in the case of  A  University                Member ( other than the Members for                tho Universities of Oxford and                Cambridge) special arrangements                should  be made to enable the                Vouchers to be used between the                Metropolis and any one  of the                Constituent University  Towns.            (4)  That at the close of the present                Parliamentary Session the question                whether Season Tickets  should, in                future, be granted and, if so, on                what conditions should  be re-                examined in the light of experience                gained,  from the working of the                Voucher system.            (5)  That in 81137- event the grant to                Members of Parliament of open                passes  on the Railways  should not                be  entertained, 5o    The  Committee  recommend;-fl]That 1st Class Tickets should beprovided in all -eases and those,if neeer-sary, should be defendedon the ground that it is usual for members of Parliament to work whentravelling and that it was accordinglynecessary for them to have the maximumfacilities for comfort and privacy.That the provision of 1st Class faclli-&apos;ties rendered unnecessary the provision,at the expense of the. State, of sleepingaccommodations
The Committee recommend:-     That assuming tha proposals for     granting travelling faoilities     on the above lines are approved     by Parliament, every effort should     be made to bring the arrangements     into operation before the Easter     Recess.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeJ.R.
