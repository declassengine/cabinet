Thescheme has been  submitted to  the  Treasury&quot;but the Chancellor of theExchequer has not  seen his .way to authorise it.  The case for the&apos;scheme is, however, in my .opinion so  strong.that I wish it to beconsidered by the Cabinet.     2,   The case for the proposal is briefly that the projects ofrevival of the Russian and other  continental markets are&quot;good butthe  fishermen are  in danger pf losing the full advantage of the revival because  they are  very short of efficient nebs and of moneyto replace them  owing.to  depression in the industry which has pre-prevailed for several years,   &apos;       3         To show the  importance  of the question&apos;! nay say that before the War the annual exports of  cured herrings from Scotlandrose to a total  of 1,500&quot;,000  barrels  (value about&quot;&quot; 2,000,000)wile  during the last  three years the average has been only about550,000 barrels.  The  request for assistance has been strongly pressed on me by Questions and speeches in the House and by&quot;adeputation&apos; ef Members  of  Parliament representing fishing con-stituencies.  All parties in  the  House&apos;would, I&quot;believe)&apos; supportthe  request.     3,   The following is an outline of the situation and of my proposals.  A3 a rule  the nets in a Scottish herring vessel ( aswell aa the vessel itself) belong to  members of the crow. . ThssoKombers receive.as their  return for the nets a certain share(commonly 5/17tha) of the  nett proceeds of each season&apos;s operations,I.P.,  the gross  earnings.less recognised working expenses.   Theremainder of the nett  proceeds is allocated-in shares (commonly6/17tha each) to (1) the  crew (excluding&apos; a few men cn wonklvjages), and (2)  &quot;the ship&quot;,   A steam drifter requires about&quot; 160to  180 nets (costing nearly  6 each).  the total coat (including^opes  and bouys) boing at present prices 1,200 -  1,300.     4.   Before the War  the.life of  a net was considered to be fouryears  and it was the practice to.discard nets as thoy lost their6fficiency, about  ono-fourth  being renewed every year.  During and since  the&quot;War comparatively few nets  have been purchased owing tostraitened resources and  the  reserve  of nets, which formerlyprobably equalled  the  number  in use at, any one time,  is now &quot;almostentirely exhausted:  of the nets  now in use most are at least eightto ten years  old and owing to freciuont tanning have shrunk,  &amp;o thatthey do&apos; not catch  the  larger  and  most valuable herrings % and have                                                        become/
become hard and brittle.    ft.   Tne reason for the  inability of fishermen in recentvoars to maintain their normal  supply&apos; of nets has been the continuous depression in the herring fishing industry:  this isirainlv due to the fact that the principal markets for Scottishherringsl viz., Russia and Germany,  have been closed ordisorganised,    6.   At the prenent time  there arc strong indications thatthe demand for herrings on the  Continent, which became keen inthe latter part of 1923, will  continue to expand.  . Cn the otherhand the poor seasons experienced in recent years and tho high cost of coal and other stores  have combined to leave many of thefishermen without funds, wherewith to buy the nets required.    7,   The loss  of nets in 1923 and 1924 owing to exceptionallystormy weather and the sinking of worn-out nets with their catcheshas created an acute position.   Aid for the fishermen has recentlybeen demanded in the form of a errant of 50% of the prico of90,000 new nets.   This would  mean a subsidy of about  250,000.This in my view is an excessive&apos; demand and i am not in favour ofgiving assistance ao a grant or subsidy.    8.   At the same time the inability of most of the fishermento purchase tne necessary equipment, combined with the prospects ofcotter foreign markets, make it imperative in my view that.assistance should be granted by way of loans.         The existence  of a  leading industry and of a fishingcommunity which possesses unique skill and which is an invaluablereserve  of seafaring men  is  in considerable danger. -   9,    I, therefore,  propose-&quot;the following  scheme to be   inistered by the  -fishery Board for Scotland subject tosettlement of details with&apos;the Treasury:-   (1)  fishermen to  be assisted in approved cases by loans to     purchase not  exceeding  10 new&apos; nets per man: (value about   (2) the loan normally,to  be 50% of the cost; i..e.,. .a loan of      about  26 for 10&apos;nets;   (o)  the loans to  bear Interest at 5%:   (4)  fishermen to  be  eligible for loans only if -      (a) they cannot merit  the cost from their own resources:      (b) they have a. nucleus of gear  outfit or would: under         normal  conditions  have acquired such an outfit:   (5)  in special  cases,  e.g.,- young;&apos;&quot;men&apos;, ex-service or otherwise,      who  owing to  War  or post-War&quot;conditions have never had an      opportunity to  acquire&quot;the nucleus of an outfit, tho maximum      loan  may be 75% oi tjo  cost: -   (5)  loans to be repayable within three years..  Each borrower      to repay  in any season at  least&apos; 20%&apos; of his share of the nett      proceeds  allocated to tho  nets: (see paragraph 3).  Any                                                        question/
          question  as to  the  calculation of such share to be          decided finally&apos;by  the  fishery Board:      (7)  nets to be orderod  through ordinary trade channels          under  supervision of  fishery Board.    10,    The needs are estimated at 50,000 nets costing nearly  6 each, and tire total advances at  150,000.    As the production of the net  factories is&apos; limited the supply of note would continue during  the remainder ef  1924 covering the Scottish auamer- season and the autumn  season off East  Anglia,    11,    The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have been consulted,  and state that, the Bftheiie would cause them no embarrassment, and that if it should be necessary for them to frame  a similar  scheme for English fishermen, they anticipate few comparable cases in which a loan would be needed.   No demand of  the kind has as yet been made by English fishermen.    12.  (I recognise that the  estimated total of the loans ( 150,000)  is a  considerable  sum  to advance.   I admit also that there  is a substantial risk of  loss if successive fishings should unexpectedly fail owing to circumstances beyond the control of Kan or if  tne European&apos;situation  and with it  the market for cured  herrings should grow worse  instead of better.  But the fishermen  concerned, mainly at  ports on the Moray&apos;Firth and the East- Coast  of Scotland are en errtorprisinr, thrifty and reliable cl&amp;fls  of men who may be counted on to repay well if their venture succeeds.                        *          Unlesst therefore,  we suffer misfortunes in the. sphere of Continental affairs or-of  nature,  there is reasonable ,prospect that the loans will be wholly or  largely repaid and that great.benefit will be  conferred at&apos;comparatively small cost to the Exchequer  on a very deserving class of working fishermen who are struggling hard to restore  the fortunes of their industry.    13.    Apart  from the  risk of  loss with &quot;hich I have already dealt&apos;the  objections of the Treasury are:- ,  .(l)    they are  not satisfied  that the fishermen will in fact be unable to obtain  tho  necessary gear in the ordinary course;                                     &apos;    (2)    the scheme appears  to present considerable administra-tiva difficulties:    (.3)    in any case the Treasury feel that  the proper remedy forany lack &quot;of credit  facilities among the fishermen should lie in wie establishment of Co-operative Credit Societies and the initiation of a  scheme providing  funds from the Exchequer appearsto them to bo fatal to the prospects of any such movement.          My replies to these objections are  as follows:- 1  (1)    the Scottish Fishery  Board have had the situationclosely -under review for  a considerable period and I am satisfiedthat the fishermen, generally speaking,  will  not be able to findJunds  or credit  to  obtain the gear that is requisite,   - If thecoats  go to sea  with inadequate gear they will probably fail to clear  their heavy working expenses or to&apos; secure&apos; sufficient                                                        margin/                                            M
margin to put the fishermen  on their  foot  again.     (2) The administrative  difficulties  are admittedlyconsiderable, especially in  view  of the  fact that we have to rely  on the personal security of  the  fishermen.    But theadministration of the scheme will be  in  the hands of a capableDepartment which&apos;has wide experience  in  such matters and hasFishery Officers closely acquainted with the fishermen&apos; acircumstances in all the large ports  concerned,     (o) While I am in favour of  the-principle of Co-operativeCredit Societies and should.be prepared  to endeavour toestablish them in the fishing, industry,  I  am bound to recognisethat  such establishment could not in,any. event be effected withina year or more.  We are here dealing  with  a.pressing-emergency whicl:obviously cannot wait-for the creation of  such mac Inner&apos;/,   Thesuggestion made by the Treasury will-not,  therefore, meet thecase.. -  ; 14.&quot;   My. proposal would  not in any. sense commit theGovernment to giving similar aid  to the;other great branch of   -the fishing industry, namelyi the trawling. branch because of fundamental differences between the two.-   The trawling industryis financed and worked, as a rule, by large&apos;Companies and it hasa good market in this; country,  .  The.men&apos; to whom.my -schemeapplies are working fishermen whose success depends entirely onforeign markets although a. small  proportion of their catch isconsumed in this&apos; country, ;    ,&apos;  &quot;   15...  Li trust that, upon  consideration of the  matter theCabinet, will authorise the proposed scheme.                    .           ADAMSON.Scottish/Office, -  Whitehall.
