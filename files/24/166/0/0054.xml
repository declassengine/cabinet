April 16th. explaining the steps, which the Government have taken and. the progress they havemade in the preparation of their Housing proposals,-(Intd.)  J.W.ministry of  Health,April  11th,  1924
          I am glad to have this opportunity of explaining to the House the steps which the Government have taken and theprogress they have made In the preparation of their Housingproposals.          The broad results under the scheme authorised by theHousing Act of 1923 up to the 1st April are as follows          6,140 houses have been completed;         30,405 additional houses are under construction,while the contracts made or certificates issued by localauthorities cover a further 37.,546 housesc          Though they fully appreciate&apos;the efforts made bylocal authorities or private enterprise, the Government cannotregard the scheme of this Act as providing a solution of present difficulties or even as leading to a solution within a reason-able times          The majority of the houses are being built for sale,.Comparatively little &quot;is being done for the great mass of thosewho are only able to pay a rent, and we can see no prospect cfthis growing demand being met.   The Government therefore came to the conclusion that a broader policy was necessary and thatthey mast endeavour to devise means which would lead to thsprovision, in larger numbers and at a more rapid rate, ofhouses built primarily for letting and not merely for selling;and that the rent3 should be such as the worker, let us say the man building the house, Is able to pay,.          A true national policy should not only meet these points, but should provide means by which shortage will be overcome, the growing needs will be met and unsatisfactoryhouses and slum conditions will be replaced by decent houses.          With this end In view the Government invited theassistance of representatives of the Building Industry and of
the manufacturer a- -of&quot;hniildlng^- ma-terla 1,       I   As  a  resiilt the Government have receive-d an extra-ordinary valuable report and I desire to express the thanksof the Government to all those in the industry who have spentso much time  and skill in framing an industrial policy tomeet the national needs,          The main point to be noted in the report is that theindustry have come  to the conclusion that, on the basis of along term programme of house building;, it CRH secure such anaugmentation of the building labour of the country as will ensure a production of houses which will go far to meet theessential needs of not only keeping pace with the normaldemands, but of making good the present shortage and doingsomething effective to get rid of slum conditions,          without pledging itself to the detail of all therecommendations contained in the Report, I am able to saythat the Government are prepared to accept the principle ofa long programme and are? hopeful that this will command thesupport of all parties in the House.           It has been a fixed principle of all recent legisla-tlon aiming at a solution of the housing problem, that thematter should be tackled on the basis of a partnership between the Government and the local authorities.  Accordinglyas soon as the industry were in a position to report as towhat was practicable I summoned a conference with the localauthorities,   I met representatives of the local authoritiesyesterday and explained to them the principles which it seemedto the Government necessary to observe0   These I may sum upas follows          The provision of houses in numbers sufficient to     meet the -needs I have described.          The adoption of a long programme as a means of     sectoring the necessary augmentation of the resources
                                                        a r&apos; n     of the building^indusla^.          The provision of houaes-for letting-at rents  within     the capacity of the workers.          The local authorities undertook to form a small committee to consider these principles and to go into thenecessary financial arrangements.          I hope to oonclude the negotiations as soon aspossible after the Recess and to lay before the House ourcomplete proposals, but the Government felt that it was  due  tothe House that we should describe as fully as possible  thelines on which we are proceeding, and the progress we have beenable to make.
