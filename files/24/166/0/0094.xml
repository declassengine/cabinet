FfUHIS DOCUMENT IS THS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMSNT). Id RET1^895(34)            OA B I HE T.         HOME  AFFAIRS  COMMITTEE.         GUARDIANSHIP  OF  INFANTS.Memorandum hy the lord advocate on Draft Bill           (CP.287(24).Id       80 far  as  the Draft Bill  proposes  oy Clauses  1 &amp; 2 to  place the father and the mother of  a child  on a footing of equality before the Court in any  prooeedlnga  relating to  the custody of tho child or the administration of  the child&apos;s  property, I have no criticism  to off ex1.       With regard to  Clause  3,  however,  while I  appreciate the position in which the  matter  stands,  ae explained by the Solicitor^ General, I confess that I view with extreme apprehension the  intro- duotion into the  law of Scotland of a form of prooedure which permit a of the pronouncement at the instance  of a wife of a  decree against her husband relating to the custody or maintenance of their children whioh ia to he ineffective ao long aa the spouaea continue to reeide together.   Such,,  a decree would  presumably be pronounced in terrorem and might indeed  furnish the  wife  with an inducement to leave her husband if ahe  happened to be in disagreement with him upon any matter quite apart from  the children&apos;e  welfare.    The  introduction of such a minatory deoree Into the married relations  of spouses  who are living together appears to me to be subversive  cf both  social and ethical propriety, besides being ohjectionable  in point  of form by ^squiring the Court to pronounce a decree the enforceability  of which depends on the wife leaving her husband irrespective of  whether she has good reason to do ao or not  and irrespective  of  any  change of circumstances.(Intd)    H.P.M.Advocate&apos;s Chambers,Dover House,   8th May 1924.
