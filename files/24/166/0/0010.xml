(This document  is the property of His  Dritannic  Majesty1^  government).gO RET.,210(24).CABINET.. THE TRADES UNION CONGRESS GENERAL C0UIIC1LAND LEGISLATION.REQUEST FOR COPIES OP DRAFT BILLS.Memorandum by the HoneSecretary.      1 have seen a copy of the Memorandum which the Ministerof Labour is circulating to my colleagues on this subject.Council who ask ne for an advance copy of the Factory Bill.I am in general agreement with the&apos;Memorandum of the Ministerto send to Mr. Bramley&apos;s request:.-         &quot;With regard to your letter of the 15th instant on      the subject of the Governments Factory Bill, it goes      without saying that I am both ready and desirous to      consult with the General Council of the Trades Union      Congress on any matters they nay wish to discuss with me      or any proposals they may have to put forward for the      amendment of the Factory Acts and the improvement of      factory conditions.         But you asked me for something quite different, viz.,      that the general Council may be supplied with an advance      copy &apos;of the Government Bill, when prepared, before it is      introduced in the House of Commons,   I cannot agree w.j h      you that that request is in accordance with the usual      practice of Departments.   It would be in fact, so far as      I am aware, quite  contrary to the practice.         The Government&apos;s business as I conceive it, in the      preparation, of such a Bill as the Factory Bill, is to be      open to receive and examine suggestions from any quarter,      and when they have considered all the materials at their have received similar representations from the Generalof Labour, and the following is the answer which 1 am proposing
      disposal,  to present their proposals to Parliament,      on their own responsibility,  for Parliaments      consideration.         1 think you will see,  on reflection, that no other      course is really possible for any Government,   If      draft Bills wore to be circulated to various bodies      interested before being introduced into Parliament,      the task of - legislation would be made enormously      difficult and burdensome, and progress would be      greatly impeded.&quot;      I shall be glad to know whether my colleagueapproveof this.                                     A.H.25th March,  1924.
