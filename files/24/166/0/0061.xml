April 1924.SECRET.                                                              ..   39C.P. 261 (24).         CABINET.SPECIAL   REPORT    ON    UNEMPLOYMENT.       No.   103.    Period ended March  24,  1924.    THE unemployment  figures for the month  show  a decrease of  91,968,representing 8-2 per cent, of the total of registered unemployed on the 25th February.The improvement has been steadily maintained throughout the period, the reductionsrecorded in each of the four weeks being, respectively, 18,747, 21,525, 21,680 and30,016.   As will be seen from Part II of the report, the industries which have mainlycontributed towards  this result are motor and general  engineering,  woollens andworsteds, building (chiefly  house decorating) and clothing.    In view of the recent discussions in the House of Commons&apos;on the immigrationof aliens and the payment to them of unemployment benefit, I am including in thisreport (Part III)  a  note showing the conditions under which the entry of aliensto this country for employment is controlled.

Leeds. Decrease  1,374 (930 men, 444 women) due to  continued improvement in    building, engineering and wholesale clothing industries.Sheffield. Decrease 1,643 (1,273 men,  370 women) due to settlement  of dispute   &apos; in cutlery trade and slight improvement in most industries.    Coal Mines. The employment position remains good, and continued improve-ment has occurred in most districts.  In the North-Eastern Counties the demand for house and steam coal is good and export trade has rapidly recovered from the set-backoccasioned last month  by the dockers&apos; strike.  New coal seams have been struck invarious parts of this area.  In the North-Western and Welsh coal-fields trade isbrisk and unemployment is practically confined to unskilled surface workers and mensuffering from some disability.  An attempt is being made to reclassify workpeopleon the Unemployed Registers of this industry in Wales with a view to the transfer toother industries of such workmen who are unlikely to regain employment in collieriesby reason of infirmity or age.   In the Midlands trade is good in most districts, andthere is  a demand for skilled men.   Unskilled surface workers are only fairly wellemployed.  In the  Somerset fields and  at  Bristol and the forest of Dean trade isbusy and improving.  In Scotland  trade is brisk.   Foreign orders are particularlygood and the Fife coal-fields have secured large contracts for  the  Swedish StateRailways in competition with German (Westphalian) firms.    Stone Quarries. The employment position remains good.    China  Clay. Employment continues good.  Full time  is being worked  inCornwall and Devon, but it is doubtful  whether the industry can absorb  any moreworkers at present.    Iron Mines. The employment position is bad generally.  In the Cumberlandand Cleveland districts the situation is serious and further depression has occurred.At Barrow one mine has closed during the month, rendering 600 men unemployed.    Tin Mines. In the Cornish tin mines employment remains fairly good amongstskilled workers, but large numbers of unskilled men and surface workers  remain onthe Unemployed Registers.IRON  AND STEEL  PRODUCTION.    The  employment position  in the pig-iron industry and iron and steel trade generally is  bad and has become worse  during the month.  In the  North-eastern counties,, conditions remain very uncertain. The weakness which has developed  inthe Cleveland pig-iron market since the beginning of the year appears to have become more pronounced.  Trade has suffered dislocation through recent disputes in otherindustries and has experienced keen Continental competition.  Export  trade has suffered  severely.  Manufacturers in the Sheffield area appear to be in a  somewhatbetter position as foundries and rolling-mills  are fairly busy  and additional openhearth furnaces have been lighted.  A number of Sheffield steel firms, however, arequiet, and orders lack continuity.  In the North-Western Counties trade has declinedduring the period under review.  At Barrow 1,000 men have been discharged fromsteel works and at Workington there has been further  depression, affecting  about900 men.  In the Midlands there has been no change of importance during the month,and, although considerable fluctuations in trade have occurred at some centres, theposition  on the whole remains bad.  In Wales the employment situation remainsfairly good and is much better than  in other parts of the country.  In iron and steelworks there full time has been worked throughout the month by all the main firmswith two exceptions.  The outlook, however, is not reassuring, and it is anticipatedthat one large firm will shortly close down its works.  In Scotland the market appearsto be stagnant owing to lack of confidence generally,  foreign  competition and the-Scotland DivisionWales  DivisionII.-POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES.
uncertainty of the labour position in related industries.  Consumers are buying forimmediate  requirements  only.   Employment  is  irregular at  Motherwell;  blastfurnaces have been damped down during the period at Parkhead and Kilmarnock,and works have been closed in Lanarkshire.TIN-PLATE AND STEEL SHEET.     Trade remains very brisk and employment has been good throughout the month.Future prospects appear  to be very favourable,  provided  that there  is no seriousset-back in the iron and steel trade.SHIPBUILDING  AND  SHIP-REPAIRING.     The employment situation generally showed slight improvement,  but towards theend  of the period under review the whole position was overshadowed in consequenceof the strike of operatives at Southampton.   The  possibility of the extension of thedispute to the whole of the industry and the uncertainty arising out of the movementin other areas by the shipyard workers for an advance of  10s. per week in wages have had a retarding influence on the position, which for some months had shown a steady advance. On the North-East Coast slight improvement was mainfest duringthe month, and a number of orders for new vessels were booked.   On the Merseysidethe repair and reconditioning of ships showed fair activity, but very little progress was  made on new construction.  At Barrow several contracts are nearing completionand  no fresh work is in prospect.  Ship-repairing  in the London yards  is still slack,but considerable improvement is reported from Canning Town and  Grays.  In theSouth-Western ports there was, on  the whole, slight improvement, with the notableexception of the Southampton and Woolston Yards, where work was paralysed by thestrike which commenced in February.  In Wales fluctuations have occurred in some districts,  but the position  generally is  slack with  a tendency towards furtherdepression.   In Scotland the employment position has  continued to  improve slowlyduring the month.  New orders have been received at Port Glasgow and in the UpperClyde area and at Aberdeen. Work has been resumed on a contract which had long been held  in  abeyance at Govan, but there were signs of slackness at Dundee.ENGINEERING.     Motor and Cycle Engineering. The employment position has steadily improvedduring the month, prospects are reported to be good, and in some of the main centresa high level of activity has been  reached.  All districts report some improvement.Highly skilled men  in the cycle trade at Aston are well employed.  Steady progress is reported in the motor trade at Coventry, Wolverhampton,  Nottingham, Sparkhill,London, Bristol and Oxford, and in some cases night-shifts continue to be worked.Aircraft works are busy at Cheltenham and Woolston.     General Engineering. Trade in this industry remains depressed, but during themonth there  has been  distinct improvement in most of the main centres.   In theNorth-Eastern Counties the outstanding  feature of the period under review has beenthe placing of substantial orders for railway rolling-stock at Attercliffe, Darlington,Middlesbrough,  Sheffield and  Wakefield.  These orders  have been received from india, Ceylon, Peru and the Argentine, as well as  for the home  market.  It isreported that Yorkshire and Lincoln will benefit by contracts,  chiefly for railway material, and amounting to  several million pounds, which have recently been placedin this country from Spain.  This evidence of recovery in the general section of theindustry has already resulted in an increased demand for engineers&apos;  and  small toolsin the districts concerned.  Agricultural tools are also being requisitioned in larger quantities  owing to seasonal requirements.   In  the  North-Western Counties theimprovement has not been so  marked, but steady progress was made in electricalmachinery manufacture, locomotive engineering,  manufacture  of  boiler plant,  and mining and  flour-milling engineering sections.   The textile  machinery and  the machine tool making sections in Lancashire are still in a depressed state.  In theMidlands depression still  prevails,  but during the month there has  been a markedtendency towards normal  conditions.  The employment position is good  at Rugby;considerable  improvement is reported from  Aston, Derby,  Newark, Peterborough,Smethwick, Stoke-on-Trent, Wednesbury,  West  Bromwich; the  situation is very uncertain at Worcester, Longton and Nottingham, and at Kettering  a decline seemsto have occurred. The industry remains quiet in East London,  but has improved in
the Home Counties.  No change of importance is reported from the South-western counties, and trade is very slack at Portsmouth, Reading and Stroud.  The employ-ment position in Wales has been fair during the month except at Pembroke Dock,where employment  is bad and no  improvement is anticipated.  General engineeringin  Scotland is still  suffering from acute depression,  which is most apparent atCoatbridge, Glasgow and Greenock.  The situation is better at Aberdeen, edinburgh and Paisley,  and  a  substantial  order for railway  plant  recently received  fromPortugal may ease the position at Johnstone.TEXTILES.    Cotton. In the  Egyptian Spinning  Section trade continues to be very good;full time is being worked and it appears that most mills have  sufficient orders onhand to ensure the maximum production for months  ahead.    In the AmericanSpinning Section, the employment position remains bad.  Practically all employershave adopted  the system of short time working and mills engaged on  this class ofwork are only running  26^ hours per week.    The adoption  of this systematiccurtailment in production had the immediate effect of creating an active demand for american yarn on a profitable basis which has enabled producers to book substantialorders.   With  the exception of Oldham, Rochdale,  Heywood, Farnworth andFailsworth, nearly all districts report considerable improvement.  Progress has been marked at Blackburn and Burnley.   In the weaving section increased employment is reported  among  operatives engaged  in  the manufacture of fancy and fine plaingoods, but  mills which  rely  upon medium and coarse cloth continue to be veryslack.    Many manufacturers are  adapting  their machinery to meet the presentdemand, and are now making classes of goods which render them less dependent onthe Indian and Eastern Markets.    Woollens and Worsteds. Further improvement has occurred in the employmentposition and there appears to be a steady revival in these trades.  In Bradford the spring trade  has commenced well  and in most districts a firm tone is manifest.Export trade has increased steadily since the beginning of the year, the best marketsbeing Japan and China.  There has been a noteworthy improvement in business withthe United States, and  shipments to Australia and Canada  have  revealed  an increasing demand.   The expansion in markets in America and the East has not,however, compensated to any appreciable extent for the loss entailed  in Europeanmarkets.  The recent improvement in the  shoddy manufacturing branch is reflected in greatly increased imports of woollen rags and there is an unsatisfied demand forsuch materials.  An excellent start has been made with this year&apos;s export trade incarpets and rugs manufactured  from  wool,  the exports of which  have greatlyexceeded the figures for 1913, both in tonnage and value.  A shortage of workers inthe more highly skilled  processes,  such as weaving,  is  reported  from Armley,Wakefield, Morley and Shipley, while workers in the spinning section of the industryremain unemployed.    Hosiery. The improvement reported last month has continued, and  betterconditions prevail in nearly all centres.  Increased activity is reported from Basford,Burton, Hanley, Ilkeston, Leicester, Nottingham and  Sutton-in-Ashfield.  Full time working is in force  at Mansfield, but trade remains stationary at Derby.  In Scottishcentres trade has improved and the employment position is fairly good.    Lace. The employment position remains bad.  Trade is poor at Nottinghamand Long Eaton in spite of  repeated efforts towards  stimulation.  At  Beeston andBasford the Leavers&apos;  Section continues  in an acute state  of depression,  but themaking-up and curtain sections have still further improved.    Silk. The seasonal  activity reported last month has  resulted  in  further improvement.    In the Leek and  Congleton district trade  has been stimulated by ademand for spring  goods, and the outlook is favourable.  Improvement continues atDerby and trade is good at Longton.    Jute. Trade in  Forfarshire continues good.  The  shortage  of skilled weavers,Reported last month, is not only preventing further expansion in the industry, but is at present actually causing temporary  suspensions  amongst workers engaged  inthe preparatory stages of the trade, who are producing more material than can  be absorbed  in  the weaving section.   This  causes fluctuations  in  the UnemployedRegister, which do not really reflect any slackness in the  trade  as a whole.  The
Arbroath Employers&apos; Association is prepared to meet this situation by a scheme fortraining girls, and one employer in Dundee has already engaged a number of tenters(men) to do the work of weavers (normally women).    Carpets. Trade is still brisk at Kidderminster.  The employment situation is good at Stroud, Salisbury and Swindon, but poor at the Scottish centres Bridgetonand Johnstone.BUILDING AND  BRICK AND  TILE MANUFACTURE.    Employment in the building trade continues very good and has improved duringthe month, particularly in the case of painters and decorators.  Most districts reportthat the shortage  of skilled operatives is becoming more  acute.  The  favourable weather  during the month has given a  stimulus to the painting trade, and in some districts the heavy registers of unemployed painters have been almost cleared.    In  the  brick  and tile  trade employment  is good in  most centres, and  atPeterborough several firms  are extending their plant in anticipation of increasedtrade.  Generally, a very optimistic tone prevails.CLOTHING.    All districts report continued improvement due to seasonal activity.  progress is particularly marked in the wholesale clothing trade, but the bespoke trade has alsoadvanced during the period.  The employment position generally  is good,  and insome districts  there is an unsatisfied demand for skilled machinists.  There is stillunemployment amongst semi-skilled workers.  The millinery business has shared inthe increased activities.  Improvement in the corset trade has been well maintained in the Midlands, and, although business is rather slack in South-Western Counties,progress is  being made  there also.  The shirt, collar and glove  trades are stilldepressed, but improving gradually.BOOT AND  SHOE.    The employment position is still only fair,  although gradual improvement hasbeen maintained.   Short time working  remains  prevalent   The fact that  leatherprices are becoming firmer has led to a more optimistic tone in the industry generally.At Northampton trade continues to  be moderately good,  but at  Kettering andWellingborough unemployment is still heavy.  There has been improved business atLeicester and Derby, while at Bromsgrove and Bilston full time is being worked.Employment remains good at Mansfield, but only moderate at Wolverhampton.  InLondon and the South-Eastern Counties improvement is reported from all districts,the greatest  activity being in connection with the manufacture of the lighter classesof foot-wear.  A,t Kingswood unemployment continues to be severe, but the positionis slightly better at Bath and Street.POTTERY.    The employment position generally remains bad.   During the period underreview the annual revision of wages has fallen due and no agreement was reached.The possibility of  an extensive  stoppage of work  on account  of a wages dispute,although rather remote, has caused uncertainty in the industry.  At Hanley, employ-ment is fairly good and trade in the sanitary fireclay section is particularly brisk,but there is  a  considerable amount of short time work in operation.  At  Stoke-on-Trent there has been a tendency towards further depression, but trade is fairly goodat Burslem and Newcastle-under-Lyme.   Improvement is reported at Longton.  the china trade at Derby  continues busy  and the  position in  the  porcelain trade atWorcester remains good.  Pottery,  earthenware and china trades  have  been busyduring the month at Bristol, Bournemouth, Exeter and Barnstaple.TRANSPORT.    No change of importance occurred during the month in the  employment positionin the dock transport  trade.  At North-East  Coast ports  employment  increased,chiefly as a result of arrears of work which accumulated during the dock strike inFebruary. The demand for timber opened up well in the New  Year;  enquiries forcargoes are good on the whole, and at North-East ports the prospects are fairly good.In most other ports the position  is less favourable than at the end of February, butemployment  does not appear to have fallen below the average  for this time of theyear.
III.-NOTE  AS   TO   THE  ADMISSION  OF   PERSONS  OF  ALIEN    NATIONALITY  TO GREAT  BRITAIN  AND NORTHERN IRELAND    TO  ENABLE  THEM  TO  TAKE  UP  EMPLOYMENT.                               I. GENERALLY.    1.  The immigration  of aliens  to Great Britain and Northern Ireland  is controlled by the provisions of the Aliens&apos; Restriction Act, 1914 (as amended by the aliens&apos; Restriction (Amendment) Act,  1919) and orders made thereunder.  The Actsreferred to expire  in December 1924.    2.  The Aliens&apos; Order,  1920,  contains  in Article 1  (3)  (6) the  followingrestriction :          &quot; (3.) Leave shall not be given to an  alien to land in the  United  Kingdom    unless he complies with the following conditions, that is to say :          *          *           *           *           *          *        &apos;&apos;(&amp;.)  if  desirous of entering the service of an employer in the United        Kingdom he produces a permit in writing for his engagement issued to the        employer by the Minister of Labour.&quot;    It  follows from the terms of the Article that aliens are not permitted to land inGreat Britain for  the purpose of searching for employment.                          II. GENERAL PROCEDURE.    3.  An employer who desires to  obtain a  permit as required by the Article  isrequired to complete a form which demands, inter alia, particulars as to the class ofwork for which the alien is required, the  alien&apos;s nationality, the salary offered, andthe steps taken to  ascertain whether  the position can be filled by British or foreigncandidates already in this country.    The employer is also asked whether he will undertake the responsibility for thereturn  of the alien to his own  country if called  upon to  do so,  and whether the admission of the alien will displace British labour.    4.  On receipt of the application form duly completed it is customary, in most cases, to make local enquiry through the machinery of the Employment Exchangesto ascertain whether labour competent  to  perform  the work  proposed to be done bythe alien is already available in this country.  If such labour is available, a  permitis usually refused.  A permit is also refused if  it appears  that the wage  or salaryproposed in the case ot the alien is  less satisfactory than would be normally paidto a British or foreign subject already in this country.    5.  Ex-Enemy  Aliens. During  the war, and  subsequently  up to   the  23rdDecember, 1919, enemy aliens were not allowed to enter the United Kingdom.   Afterthe 23rd December, 1919, when the Aliens&apos; Restriction (Amendment) Act, 1919,  came into force, former enemy aliens were allowed to enter the United Kingdom only withthe permission of  the Secretary of State for Home Affairs  in accordance  with theprovisions of Section 10 of that Act.  After the 23rd December, 1922, Section 10 ofthe Aliens&apos; Restriction (Amendment)  Act,  1919, lapsed, and the admission of formerenemy  aliens for  employment  fell to  be considered by the Ministry of Labour.Employers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland desiring to engage such alienshad, therefore, to obtain a permit under Article 1 (3) (b) of  the Aliens&apos; Order, 1920.The practice of the Ministry has been to admit ex-enemy aliens only when  they fall within  any of the  following categories  :     (a.) Cases  of  personal Relationship, where  it  appears -clear that in no          circumstances would  the alien  come on -the labour market.    (b.) Cases of Governesses, Teachers, &amp;c, coming to give personal instruction in          German or other foreign languages.    (c.) Cases where the employment of the alien  would appear likely to  result in.          the continued or increased employment of British labour.    [d.) Cases where the alien possesses special musical or other artistic talent.    6.  An appreciable number of permits are issued enabling aliens to come here for limited periods.  The limitation of the period, where it is not actually in compliance
with the employer&apos;s request, enables the Ministry to satisfy itself, before agreeing that the period may be extended, that the grounds upon which the admission of thealien was  sought (e.g., the increased employment of British labour) have  beensubstantiated.    7. It is the practice of the Ministry, before reaching a decision in certain typesot cases, to consult some advising authority as  to  the merits of  the application.Where the  incoming of  the alien is urged to be in the interests of British trade, theBoard of Trade are usually consulted, and occasionally the principal Chambers ofCommerce.  In the case of professional men and technical experts, reference is madeto an association or interested body, e.g.,  the Institution of Civil Engineers. Wherethere is a doubt regarding the availability of British labour, the appropriate TradeUnion is consulted.    8. In the case  of ex-enemy aliens, subjects  of East European  and the balkan states, and nationals  of countries  outside  Europe (except  America  and Japan)permits are only issued with the express approval of the Home Office and the  WarOffice. To co-ordinate  the views of the  various  Departments on the more difficultapplications, an informal Departmental  Committee meets at frequent intervals andrecommends whether or  not a permit should be issued.  On this Committee the HomeOffice, the War  Office, the Board of  Trade and the  Ministry  of  Labour are represented.    9. A table is given  below showing the number of permits issued during the year1923, and giving particulars of the classes of workers concerned.                           III. SPECIAL PROCEDURE.    10. In respect  of aliens of  certain classes a  special procedure  has been  set up with a two-fold object, firstly, in order not to make the administration of the Articleappear unduly oppressive to foreign nationals, and secondly, to make the presence ofthe alien here as useful as  may be possible in the employment and/or training ofBritish subjects.    11. By arrangements completed between the Board of Education and the FrenchMinistry of  Public Instruction, student  teachers are admitted for  work in the secondary  Schools  and Colleges  of  Great Britain.   Similarly,  aliens of allnationalities are  admitted where  it can be shown that they  are coming here for limited periods to gain business experience by filling  nominal vacancies in the offices of Banks and other Corporations, Merchants, &amp;c.    12. An arrangement has recently been concluded with the French Governmentwhereby some 500 French subjects of the &quot; improver &quot; class are to  be admitted for employment in Great Britain as an act of reciprocity for the employment of Britishsubjects in France.   No permits in respect of French subjects  have yet been applied for as provided, by this arrangement.                         IV. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.                        (1.) Attitude of  the Employers.    13. Complaints from employers  regarding the requirement of the Order or its administration are not numerous, except in the case of certain classes of &quot; domestic &apos;employees.    It is  apparently generally recognised that during a time of acuteindustrial depression it  is not possible to  contemplate the free entry of alien subjectswho would be able  to compete with unemployed  British labour. Such complaintswhich have been received  are  in  the main  from  persons  who,  having satisfied themselves that labour is not available in  this country, object to the Ministry makingindependent enquiries having the same object.                      (2.)  Attitude of the Trades Unions.    14. Since the issue  of permits is closely restricted, the number of unions  whom it is found necessary to consult  is small.   The views of a Union are the subject of careful consideration by the Ministry, which, however, retains its own discretion onall cases.                                                ,

Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for australia new Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion authorities concerned.  In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land havebeen agreed  with the Governments  of New South  Wales,  Victoria and Western Australia.  A number  of  organisations, having  as their  object the  provision of facilities for  the  settlement  of immigrants in certain  of the Dominions, have alsobeen assisted.   An extension of this assistance  to other  organisations is  underconsideration.    The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of  departuresduring the month of February and for the whole period up to date are set out iffthe following Table: Dominion.

To  assist in the  provision  of employment for  demobilised members of  HiaMajesty&apos;s Forces until such time  as they  could be re-absorbed  into industry, theGovernment after the Armistice inaugurated  a  special  fund for the  purpose ofmaking grants on certain conditions to  Highway Authorities for road work.

In  England and Wales the provision under the Land  Settlement  (Facilities)Act, 1919, of small holdings and  other  Land Settlement Schemes for  the  benefitprimarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries, and  (b) through the agency  of County Councils and  Councils  ofCounty Boroughs.
    Settlement through  Local Authorities. These schemes  are financed by  theExchequer in three ways :  (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account  (e.g., due to  charging a fair, as opposed to aneconomic, rent) so far  as such loss has been reasonably and  necessarily incurred;(3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities  and the then value ofthe undertakings at the 31st March,  1926.    In Scotland land settlement is  not  conducted through the  agency  of CountyCouncils.    Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon  and the difference, if any, between  theannual cost  of maintaining and administering them and  the rents received from small holders being  borne by the Exchequer.    No  further  properties are  being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash, receipts will suffice to meetcash  outgoings.
