MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.SECRET.3.P.840/. 24).^L.    I  circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues&apos;,  copies of the two Unemployment Insurance Bills which I introduced this week and of the Government Actuary&apos;s Report  on the larger Bill.      The Bills are framed in accordance with decisions already given by the Cabinet. 2.    The smaller Bill,  whioh has to be passed before Easter, is  down for second Reading next Tuesday.   I have given an undertaking,  in answer to a question in the House, that this Bill will be in fibs Vote Office on Monday morning, and for general reasons of policy, which I have explained previously^ I regard it as essential that thiB Bill should not be published before the largerBill. 3.    The Aotuary&apos;B Report showB that the financial provision made in the larger Bill is adequate.   I understand from this that owing to the pressure under which the Report has had to be prepared Borne of the figures are subjeot to further sorutiny, but I have his assurance that this is not likely to reeult in any material alteration. 4.    In para, (s) of the Report there is certain comment implying that the assumptions as to future employment (viz:- an average of 1,100,000 up to next Ootober, 1,000,000 during the rest of the deficiency period, and POOiOOO thereafter) may be unduly pessimistic.   These assumptions however are deliberately made on a conservative basis in order that the Unemployment Fund may be solvent even if our                                                 /hopes
                    2.hopes of an improvement in employment do not materialise.If the figures prove to be lower than those assumed,  thodeficiency period may be shortened and the financial basisof the scheme will be the more secure.                       (intd.) T.  S.Ministry of Labour.5th April, 1924,
Unemployment  Insurance  (Ho,  2)                      Bill.                 MEMORANDUM.    The principal provisions of this Bill are as follows :     Period of Benefit. Up to a limit  of one  week ofbenefit for  every six contributions paid, or of 26 weeks of benefit during a &quot;benefit year&quot;  (whichever  is theless), benefit is to be paid on  conditions which  are inthe main the  same  as  those applied  by  the  existing law  to convenanted  benefit (clause  1 (1)  and  (2)).Certain modifications of  the  existing conditions in thisrespect  are proposed  in clauses  3  and 4.   &quot; Benefityear &quot; is defined in clause 1 (5).    Further benefit for a period additional to the above is to be payable if and so long as the insured contributorsatisfies not only the conditions already referred to, butalso the additional conditions specified in clause 1 (3).    Persons Insured. Boys  and girls between the ages of 14 and  16 years are on and  after 6th October, 1924,to  be   insured  against  unemployment on becomingemployed in  an insured  trade (clause 5).  Under theexisting law no  persons under  the  age of 16 years areinsurable.    Courses of Instruction. Provision is already  madein section 7 of  the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920,for enabling  unemployed persons to  be  required toattend courses of instruction, at Juvenile UnemploymentCentres or elsewhere, as  one of the conditions for thereceipt of  benefit.  The  Bill proposes  to authorise theMinister of Labour, with  the consent of the Treasury,to pay certain  grants out of  the unemployment fundtowards the cost of such courses of instruction (clause 11).88-8a
    Rates  of- Benefits. The  weekly . rates -of benefit under the  existing law and those proposed by the Bill(clause 2 and Part II. of First Schedule) are as follows: Existing rate.   Proposed rate.Men    -    -    -     15s.             18s.Women -    -    -     12s.             15s.Boys (16 to  18)    -   7s. Qd.          Is. U.

Rates of Contribution. No change  is proposed inthe rates  of contribution payable for the  time being(and until the  end of . the &quot; deficiency period&quot;  by employers, employed and the  Exchequer respectively,in respect of the classes of workpeople at present insured.    For boys and girls between 14 and 16 years of agethe weekly rates of contribution  proposed during the deficiency period are the same  as those payable during that period in respect of boys and girls between 16 and18 years of age (clauses 2 and 5) and are as follows:            Employer.   Employed person.  Exchequer.    Boys  -     5d.            4^.            3^.    Girls   -    4\d.           U.             3fd.    Section 4  of the  Unemployment Insurance Act,1923, provides  that after the  end of  the  deficiencyperiod the rates of contribution  from employers  andemployed shall  be  reduced  so  as  not  to exceed certain specified  maximum  rates  and  that the  exchequer contribution, which is at present approximately one-thud of  the  combined contributions  of  employers andemployed, shall  become  one-fourth  of  the combinedcontributions.   The  Bill leaves unaltered the maximumrates  for  employers  and employed &quot; but  proposes that the  Exchequer  contribution shall  after  the endof  the   deficiency  period  become  one-half  of . the combined contributions  of employers  and empkryed(clause  6) i.e., one-third  of  the total contributions of
employers,  employed and the Exchequer.  Under theproposals of  the Bill  the  maximum rates of weekly contribution when the reduction  above  referred  to ismade after the  end of the deficiency period would beas follows :                                    &quot;                 Employers.  Employed.  Exchequer.    Men    - -   -    U.           U.          M.    Women -    -  -  5d.          id.:         *Hd.    Boys (14 to 18)   3d.          3d.         :  3d.    Girls (      ,,  )   2\d.          2d.          2\d.    &quot;Deficiency period&quot; is defined in section 16 (1) ofthe Unemployment Insurance (No.  2)  Act, 1921,  asfollows:     &quot; The expression &apos; the deficiency period&apos; means  the        period between the passing of this Act and  the        date  certified by the Treasury to be the date        on  which  the unemployment fund,  in  the        opinion of the Treasury, having regard to all        the circumstances of the case, is solvent:          &quot; Provided that the unemployment fund shall        not be deemed to be solvent while any advances        made  by  the Treasury for the  purpose  of        discharging the liabilities of the unemployment        fund are outstanding.&quot;    Trade  Dispute  Disqualification for Benefit. Undersection 8 (1) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920,workpeople thrown out of work owing to a  stoppage ofwork due to a trade dispute at the factory, workshop, orother  premises at which  they were&apos; employed,  are ingeneral disqualified for benefit so long  as the stoppagecontinues.  The Bill proposes to  remove this disqualification-cation if the insured contributor  proves  that he  is  notparticipating in the  trade  dispute which   caused  the stoppage of work and that he does not belong to a gradeor class of workers members of which are participating in the dispute (clause 4(1)).    Special  Schemes of Insurance by Industries.-Thepower  conferred by  section  18  of  the UnemploymentInsurance Act, 1920, to make special schemes of insur-ance by industries is, by section 5 of the UnemploymentInsurance (No.  2) Act, 1921, suspended  during  the&quot;deficiency period&quot; of the  unemployment  fund.  TheBill proposes that the power to make special schemes
shall  be abolished  for the future, subject  to  a savingclause iii favour of the continuance of any special schemealready approved or submitted  to the Minister  in  acomplete form before 3rd April 1924.    No restriction  is proposed in the power to makesupplementary  schemes  of  insurance by  industries asconferred by section 20 of the Unemployment InsuranceAct, 1920.    Refunds to Workpeople at age of 60 years. Undersection  25  of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920,workpeople  reaching the  age of 60  years  (or their personal representatives) may, under certain conditions,obtain a refund of the contributions paid by them (lessany benefit  received by them) with compound interest at 2\- per cent.    The Bill proposes to abolish  these refunds for  thefuture (clause 9 (6)) but provides that:    . (a) Valid claims for refund which could have been        made  before the passing of  the  Bill into law        are to  be paid in full if made Avithin 12 months        thereafter (clause 9 (6));    (b)  Insured contributors aged  50 years  or over        when the Bill passes into&apos;law (or their personal      -  representatives) in whose case a refund has not        then become due, are  to  receive compensation        on the terms specified in clause  9(1) and (4)        for the loss of  their  prospective  rights to a        refund, provided that they have paid at least        50  contributions  before  the  passing of the        Bill into law and  make their claims  within        12 months thereafter (clause 9 (1) and  (2).

Ox IifibOiiT o(1)As instructed I. have examined the provisions  of  theUnemployment Insurance (Ho,. 2)  Bill, and have to report asfollows:-          The principal provisions of the Bill which involvefinancial oonsiderations are as follows     the principal Act,  under which  (ao subsequently amended)     benefit was  limited to  one  day&apos;s  benefit  in respect of     each weekly  contribution paid, with a  maximum of 86     weeks  benefit in any benefit  year.         It is new proposed that, subject  to  special     requirements being  fulfilled, an  unemployed insured     person shall be  entitled to benefit for each week of     unemployment after  the  first.         Certain modifications  are also made  in the     statutory conditions for the  receipt of benefits(li)      The weekly  rate of unemployment benofit ia to  be     increased from 15/- to  IS/- in the  case of  men,  and     from 12/- to 15/- in the case of women, the rates in     the case of  juveniles aged  16 to  13 remaining as at     present,   Ho increase  is to  be made in the 5/-     a week grant in  respect of  an adult dependant,  but(i)Tho extension of benefit beyond that allowed under/it

 ,    xn the following paragraphs  I  show first what will ho(the  estimated income and expenditure  of  the  Unemployment Fund^qunder the provisions of the Bill and  I  then  prooeed to examinethe  finanoial implications of  the  various proposals as summarised in  the foregoing paragraphs,     I estimate that the number of  parsons  at presentinsured under the Unemployment Insurance scheme is about 11,250,000and  that the proposed extension to include juveniles betweenthe  ages of 14 to 16 will eventually add some 600,000 to this number.  In regard  to this latter  figure the Census of 1921shows that some 750,000 persons of thsso ages wero engaged ininsurable occupations, but having  regard to  the probability that many will be wcrking for parents or will Qscape insuranoe forother reasons, I do not think  that any-larger addition than600,000 to the numbers of insured  persons can safely beassumed,  is regards the rate  of unemployment I am instructed by  the Minister of  labour that the present estimates shouldbe based on the assumption that the numbers  on the &quot;live register&quot;will average 1,100,000 up to  the end of the  present benefit year as  to 15th Ootober  next, 1,000,000 thereafter until the end ofthe  &quot;aefioieaoy period&quot;, and  800,000 after the end of the deficiency period.     It should ba  pointed out that these numbers arc toba  assumed to include &quot;short-time&quot; workers and juveniles betweenthe  ages of 14 and  16.  The number on the live register(including an allowance for persons working  &quot;short-timo&quot;) on24th Maroh last Was 1,057,660, and whilst tho newly includedjuveniles will add  a number of persons,  which I estimate at20,000, to the register and the full effect  of the recantrelaxation in the rules regulating the  grant of unoovonantedbenefit may not yet have bean  raalised,  it would appear that having regard to the general  tendency of unemployment thoassumptions as to numbers unemployed mado by tho Minister dont)t postulate any improvement  over the  prosont position until&amp;fter Ootober next.                                                     /(4)
 (4)    Throughout  this  report,  1 assume that the new provisions  will  operata  as from 1st July next, except that Juveniles ag.3d 14-16  will not  ha included in the schema until 6th October next.      On  tha  basis abovs described I ostimata that the total amount received  in contributions from employers, employed and  the State, from 3rd  April  1924, up to 15th October next, ths and of the  present benefit  year, will be  26,100,000, from which sum  falls to be  deducted the cost of administration, which I am instruotad should be taken  at the rate of  4,000,000 a year, or  2,200,000 for the  period  in question,  leaving a net inoome of  23,900,000. (5)    As  regards  the cost of benefits, it should ba noted that the  totals  of tho &quot;live register&quot; do not affcrd a correct index of the numbers of persons actually entitled to benefit.  In the first  place,  they include a number of persons in uninsured occupations and  a further number of persons in insured occupations who  are disentitled  to benefit for various reasons, but who continue  to register.   There is a further class of persons, included  in the  &quot;live  register&quot;, who have mado a claim to benafit but who  are undergoing the statutory &quot;waiting week&quot; at the commencement of  their  spell cf unemployment.      In  order to estimate the cost of benefits it is necessary to establish tha proper relationship between the weekly benefit payments and the numbers on the live register, since it is the latter figura which has bean furnished by the Minister  cf Labour as a basis for  estimates.  On this point I havo been supplied  by the  Minister with a detailed analysis of tha claims current  and of the benefit payments mado, at a number of representative employment exchanges, in respect of the week ending 29th March 1924.   I  have also examined the weekly statistics published by the  Ministry as to numbers on tha &quot;live register&quot; in conjunction with  the weekly totals of benefit payments.  In tho  rosult I arrive  at the conclusion that it may properly be assumed,  that the total weekly benafit payments will be equivalent to a sum  ascertained by taking 75 per oont of the parsons on the                                               /&quot;live register&quot;iSSKSasaanm,----imii..............-,_____-_...... &apos;......................m.......M, .....---....................m...........      * II
n P 4&quot;live register1&quot;  at  the  full  weekly rate of benefit,  includingallowances  to  dependants.    This figure has been reached after a consideration  of the  statistics  in respect of a period duringwhich the right  to  establish Special Schemes for individual industries  has been suspended.    It will,  therefore,  continue tobe applicable  when  this  right is definitely withdrawn under theterms of Clause  8 of  the present Bill,(6)   On this basis, and  allowing for the increase in  therates of benefit, as  provided in the Bill, from 1st  July next,I estimate  that  the expenditure  in benefits up to the end ofthe  present benefit year (including  25,000 for JuvenilesUnemployment Centres) will be  21,500,000.   To this  sum falls to be added the  sum of  200,000  in respect of interest on the debt of the unemployment fund, making a total expenditure of 21,700,000.   As the net income as shown in para,  (3) forthe  same period  is  estimated at   23,900,000, the estimatedreduction in debt will be  2,200,000 and the debt will be diminished  from  its present  figure of  10,050,000 to about 7,800,000  by 15th October next.(7)    Similarly,  I  estimate  that with an average number of1,000,000 on the &quot;live register&quot; the net Income and expenditurein the succeeding period up  to 51st .March, 1925 will  be  21,200,000and   17,600,000  respectively,  thus admitting of a further reduction in debt of   3,600,000.   But during this period the  bulk of the  compensation in  respect of the refunds underSec.  (25) of the Act  of  1920,  mentioned in para, 2  (v) above,will  become payable,  with a  consequent addition to the debt ofthe fund.    As  shown in  para. (12) below, I estimate  the sum,so payable, at  3,300,000, and the debt with interest on 1st April,1925, is accordingly  estimated  at  7,700,000.         Assuming  the  continuance of 1,000,000 persons on the&quot;live register&quot;  I estimate that  the debt will be finally                                                      /extinguished
to r.-!)extinguished about April  1926,  and,  in view of the fact that the contingent  liability  for  refunds  at  the age of 60 will, underthe provisions  of the Bill,  have  been extinguished,  this datemay be  taken as  the end of  the  &quot;deficiency  period,&quot;(8)  After the  end of the  &quot;deficiency period&quot;, themaximum rates  of contribution of  employers and employed togetherare fixed by the Act  of 1923 at if-  a week for men,  and 9d,  aweek for women,  with  half rates for  juveniles.  Under Clause(6) of  the  present Bill,  the Exchequer contribution  is fixed atone-half of these figures.       Taking  the average numbers on the &quot;live register&quot; at800,000 as  instructed, I  estimate that the total annual income from contributions at the maximum rates would be  35,000,000from which  has  to be  deducted expenses of administration, whichI am instructed  should be taken at  3,500,000, making a net annual  income  of  31,500,000,       I estimate that the  cost of benefits in a year atthe increased  rates provided in Part II of the First Schedule tothe Bill will  amount  to  30,500,000, thus leaving an annualbalance of   1,000,000, which could be applied to build up areserve against future contingencies.(9)   In all the above calculations  I have taken no  accountof the  possible  effects of  Clause (4) of the Bill in regard tcpayment in  certain cases  of trade disputes.  In the  nature of thecase, this  is  a factor the  oost of which is insusceptible of calculation.                        The cost  to  the Exchequer.(10)   The  cost to  the Exchequer will be increased during the&quot;deficiency period&quot;  for two reasons&quot;.1&apos;   In the first place theinclusion  of  juveniles between the ages of 14 and 16 increases                                                           / the
 the  numbers  of  insured persons  in  respect  of whom  an Exchequer grant  is payable;  I  estimate tho consequent annual charge upon the Exchequer at  440,000.    In the  second place, the provisions,of the Bill in  regard to increases in the weekly rates of benefit and in  the periods for which benefit is payable, will result  in increased charge upon the fund with a consequent extension  of the &quot;deficiency period&quot; beyond the date when it would have terminated under the provisions! of the existing -Acts,   On the other hand some profit to the fund will accrue from the contributions of the new class of juveniles nov? to be included.   The net result is that the relief to the Exchequer arising from the reduction in its contribution after the end of the &quot;deficiency period&quot; which is provided for under the present statutory provisions, will be deferred for a period ofabout 12 months.   I estimate the additional charge on theExchequer during the period at   7,000,000a   In this connection I do not regard the  payment of the  compensationreferred to in para (7) above as involving an extension ofthe &quot;deficiency period&quot;.    If the right to refunds  of contributions at age 60 had remained as part of the Scheme of Unemployment Insurance,  it would have been necessary tobuild up reserves in the  Unemployment Fund corresponding to the sums  new to be paid in compensation,  before the Fund could have been certified as solvent.     Under Clause (6) of the Bill the contribution  fromthe Exchequer after the end of  the deficiency period is to be increased from one-fourth to  one-half of the total contributions of employers  and  employed.    iseuming that the maximum contributions named  in the Act of  1923  (i,e.l/-  a week for men,  with corresponding rates  for women and juveniles) would have been,  and will be payable,  I estimate  that the annual cost to the Exchequer  will,be thereby increased from  5,800,000 to  11,600,000.                                                 /The

On the above  assumptions,  I estimate that the position will  be as fellows, if.  as I am informed by the Minister oflabour, the annual amount applied to Juvenile  Unemployment  -Centres will  not  exceed  100,000cEstimated Annual expenditure on benefits   of juveniles aged.  14 to 16                   280,000Share of  expenses  of  administration             170,000Contribution  to cost  of Juvonile   Unemployment Centres,             -            100,000
Compensation in respect of refunds of contributions at the age                      of 60  (Clause 9),(12)   Section (25) of the principal Act provides that aninsured person on reaching the age of 60 may be repaid if hesatisfies certain qualifying conditions, the difference betweenthe total of the contributions which he has personally paid andthe benefits which he has received with interest at the rate of2f per cent, per annum.-   It should be noted that this sum isonly payable if the insured person, survives to the age of 60, andin general,  if he has paid at least 500 contributions,        Clause (a) of the Bill directs that the present worth ofthe excess value of contributions shall be calculated in themanner prescribed by regulations and that such regulations shallhave regard, inter alia, to the fact that an insured personmay lapse from insurance or may die before attaining the ageof 60.   These provisions are clearly equitable, and indeed,do no more than lay down a basis for calculations which takesin the actual facts of tho case.        In regard to the other provisions of the Clause, itshould toe noted that     (i) compensation is restricted to persons aged 50     and over on the date when the section comes into operation,,     (ii) contributions and benefits paid subsequently to     7th November,, 1920, are to be reckoned as if they had been     paid at the rates provided by the Act of 1920.        AS to the first point,  it has already been stated thatthe present  value of any accrued balances must be ascertainedas being subject to the contingencies of death and lapsefrom insurance.  There is the further contingency that these                                               ,i   /balances
balances  may  be  exhausted  by payment of benefits  should the insured person become  unemployed  before attaining age 60,Having regard to the various contingencies in question, noassessable  value can attach to such deferred and  contingentrights as are represented  by the  balances now existing inrespect of  persons  who have many  years to run before attaining the age at  which a  refund  can be  made;  for this  reason theright to  compensation  is  limited  by the Bill to persons of theage of 50 and upwards  who  have paid at least 50 contributions.       In  order that  an estimate of the cost of the proposedcompensation  should be made. I have been furnished by theMinister  of Labour  with a  sample  of about 6,000 accounts ofpersons over  the age of 50.  On the basis of the  informationafforded  by this sample,  I estimate that the total amount  to  bepaid by way of compensation, calculated in accordance with theprovisions  of the Bill, will be about  3,300,000.  This sumhas been  included in the  estimated charges on the fund assho?m in  para. (7)  above,                         I am, Sir,                             Your obedient Servant,                            (Signed) Alfred W, Watson,
