IHT1FRIM RISPORI, 1.   At  their Meeting  on 15th April 1924  (Cabinet  27(24) 8) the Cabinet agreed  that  a Committee composed of -          The Lord  Privy Seal      (in the Chair)          The Home  Secretary          The President  of the Board of Trade          The Minister of Health          The Minister of Labour     should meet to enquire into the facts in regard     to  recent strikes, with a view to ascertaining     whether any appreciable percentage of the     unfortunate aspects of these strikes was due     to  Communist activity. 2;   In  the course  of their investigations the Committee have had before them Memoranda by the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour, copies of which are attached hereto (Appendices I and II).   In his Memorandum the Home Secretary indicates the development  of the Communist Party of Great Britain since its constitution in 1920, its objects and the unconstitutional  and  violent methods by which those objects  are  to  be attained,  its  attitudetowards representative  institutions,  its  dependence on         v financial aid from foreign  sources and  the degree  towhich it has intervened or  encouraged  recent  industrialunr e st. 3.   It should he observed  that  while  the  Communist Partyin Great Britain is extremely  active  its membership amountedin 1922 probably to not more than between  4,000 -  5,000 andthere is reason to believe  that  this number has since beenreduced.   In spite of substantial assistance  from  abroadthe Party is constantly in  great  financial  difficultieswhich appear to be due  mainly  to  the comparatively heavy expenditure which is incurred  on  literary  propaganda; for
 example,  the  circulation  of the  &quot;Workers&apos;  Weekly&quot; amounts to  about  45,000  copies a  week  exclusive  of gratuitous copies 4o    Particular  attention is directed to the evidence set out on pages 4 and 5  of the  Home Secretaryrs Memorandum regarding the aid, financial and otherwise, which the Communist Party  has from  time  to time received from the Third  Internationale  It  is a matter of common knowledge that  the  Third International is  so intimately associated with  the  Soviet  Government as to be identical with the latter in all but name,.    It is difficult to reconcile the facts as  to the  subsidization of the Communist Party by the feecutive Committee of the Third International with the solemn undertakings given in the past by the Ooviet Government to abstain,, directly or indirectly,  from all propaganda in the British Empire. 5.   On the facts at present before them the Committee are satisfied that while the Communist Party have undoubtedly intervened in recent industrial disputes with a  view to thGir prolongation and extension and have dons their best to persuade the workers  to reject the advice and instruc- tions of the Trade Unions concerned,  there is little evidence  (save perhaps in one or two cases) that the Oommtmists have actually themselves initiated a  dispute. Generally speaking the Committee are of  opinion  that the importance and influence of the Communists in thesematters may be and is often greatly exaggerated  and  that their misguided activities aro  credited  with consequences which in fact are attributable  to quite  different  causes. 6.   After careful consideration the Committee think that at the present time no useful purpose would be served  by,and. considerable harm might result  from,  any attempt by .the Government to take legal proceedings against  the communists in respect of tho matters discussed in the                                       .1;
 Home  Secretary&apos;s Memorandum.  At the same time the Committee  feel  that  in  certain  circumstances it might become  imperative  for the Government to initiate such proceedings and the  possibility of so doing must not therefore  be altogether excluded. 7o    Similarly  the Committee are not disposed to favour active participation by the Government in propaganda directed against the Communist Party, its aims and methods. Por the Government to embark on such a policy would merely give the Communists  the advertisement they desire and might easily create the impression that the Government shared the exaggerated views held in certain quarters as to the importance to be attached to Communist activities.   Moreover it should be noted that there is a growing tendency for responsible newspapers to emphasize the mischievous aspects of Communist proceedings and it is doubtful whether public opinion at home would be much influenced by propaganda by the Government,  while abroad such action is certain to bemisconstrued. 8,   At the same time the Committee are impressed with the evidence submitted to them that &quot;systematic instructions and plans are issued by the Communist Party for  penetrating the Trade Unions and securing representation on  Committeesand Councils with a view eventually to  securing  such control as will enable them to be used as instruments of  communistpolicy&quot; and think that steps should be  taken to  convey informally and confidentially to responsible Trade  union leaders the information possessed by the Government as to the real objects of the Communists and  the  manner in whiohtheir activities are being fostered and  encouraged  fromabroad.
9.   In conclusion the Committee draw attention to the statistics&apos;contained in the attached Memorandum by theMinister of labour (Appendix II) which show that there isno foundation for the suggestion that the advent of the                            abnormalGovernment has resulted in an./increase in the number ofindustrial disputes as compared with previous years.10,  The Committee recommend to the Cabinet     l&apos;l)  That the information  contained in the          Home secretary Memorandum (Appendix I)          should be placed at the disposal of the          British Representatives for use in          connection with the forthcoming negotiations          at the Conference with the  Representatives          of the Soviet Government.     (2)  That the Home Secretary should be          authorised to disclose informally and  in          strict confidence, to responsible Trade          Union  Leaders such information in his          possession as to Communistic activities          as he may thinh fit,     (3)  That the Lord Privy Seal should be          authorised to convene the Committee for          the consideration of  any question          regarding Communist activity which may          ari.se  in future.

The Communist organiser  must look upon every member of ths Party and every revolutionary  worker  as a prospective soldier in the future revolutionary army.&quot;
I                   The Party therefore accepts the principles and the instructions   /             of the Third International and these instructions are communicated             regularly and continuously either in writing, or verbally to nrarjnberB             of tho Party who visit Russia from time to tine.                   ^&quot;Considerable importance is attached by the Third International             to the progress of the movement in Britain and the organisation of the             party has recently been overhauled oniiinstructions issued by Moscow             after conference with tho British leaders.  .

The             Parliamentary and  electoral programme  of March 1932 states that                &quot;The Communist  Party adopts parliamentary activity as a revolutionary                tactio&quot;,       v             and in tho &quot;statutes and Rules&quot; it is  laid down  that                &quot;All parliamentary and municipal^representatives are  under the                direction of the Executive Committee.&quot;                   The function of a Communist elected to a representative body is             laid  down in tho Party Commission Report of September, 1922,  as follows-!                &quot; The -Communist -on a local government body must learn to uso his                situation in order to sharpen  class conflict,  to master oil the                powers and procedure of the body on which he  sits in order to push                them to their limit and. to break them when a  good issue  is raised;                to beware of thinking : of himself as a msniber of the  body on which                he sits, responsiblo for its. work,  afraid of  bankrupting the &apos;*u               &quot;municipality etc and instead  to think of himself  only, as  an agent                of the workers&apos; struggle in the  camp of tho enemy.&quot;tituti

"The Communist Party does not enter on local government bodies to help  in  their work but to expose and destroy them as part of the bourgeois machinery of administration."

Financial Aid from Moscow.

In its work  the Party has received considerable financial aid from the Third International. Up to March 1922 roughly £60,000 was received and during that year a further £30,000 was allotted. A  sum of £2,500 was allocated for the expenses of the Communist Party of Great Britain during the last election. On             December 19th 1923 the Executive Committee of the Third International instructed  the Central Committee of the Communist  Party of Great Britain

"to endeavour to raise the circulation of Communist press and utilize not less than 30% of the income of the  Party including the subsidy of  the I.K.L.I." in combating the Government of and the bourgeoisie by means of printed matter." 

The following extract shows that certain officers of the closely allied Red International of Labour Unions are paid from Moscow.

"Tom ? being an old and experienced fighter on the labour front and Chairman of tho British Bureau of the Red International Labour Unions .......... deserves adequate pay for his services. Our funds are unfortunately extremely limited ...... however he is to continue to receive £25 per month for the Bureau."

"Gowade? Gallacher as the responsible head of the British Bureau I should devote all his energies to the work in the Bureau for  which  he is to receive a corresponding fee. He propose that the Bureau pay Comrade Gallacher a  regular monthly salary of £25. This expenditure is also to  be considered  permanent, since   Gallacher was appointed.... by the Executive Bureau of the R.I.L.U All other ?expenses incurred by Comrade  Gallacher  in the discharge of his duties,  such as travel expenses etc. should be paid out of the treasury of  the British Bureau."

On 7th Ootober 19 22 the  Party Commission reported to the annual conference as follows:   &quot;The Party has now  been in  existence for over two years ..... yet in   those two years with  all the opportunities and with the tireless   activities and energy of individual workers the Party has made   no real progress either numerically or  in terms of influence&quot;.

Yesterday I  was down at  Southampton with  Bill   Gallaoher,  we had a great timo.   Its  an  unofficial  strike and one  of &apos;   the best I have every  participated in  over 7000 workers involved.   Tho critical day will  bo on  Friday when all  the Union Executives are   going  down to  Southampton to try  and persuade the men to  go  baok to   work and avoid a national lock  out,   God  being willing I  hope to be   there  too.   Its really good  to  be  alive just now.   All the propaganda   of the  last two years  is now coming home  to  roost.......  Oh if we   were only  a lot stronger what a ohance we would have.&quot;And addressing a Communist local in London on April  4th  Pollitt  said :   &quot;I have just arrived from Southampton,  We associate  ourselves with   this and when  a thing  like this happens there is  no proper leadership   .......  Our job is to,  firstly, make Southampton solid against  any   oompromise,  and secondly to  get the other Distriots  support.   This has   been done  and I have been to Southampton  on  this  business.  If the   men had been left alone they would have been back at  work beaten.   They are not though, and our job is to keep  them  solid......  so that -  the R.I.L.U.  can keep  the men up  to soratoh.&quot;      On  April 12th,  19 24 Gallaoher wrote to the Latin and MiaVEurope-anBureaux of the R.I.L.U. asking  them  to prevent  repairs-t&apos;,0 any British

IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHHIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1,   I attach (Appendix I) a- statistical statement relating to the number of workers involved in industrial disputes resulting in a stoppage of work during the month of February and March, 1924, and thenumber of working days lost.2.   It will be recognised that statistics coveringso short a period as two months have a very limitedvalue and that later experience may produce a differentresult.   It is clear, however, that,-taking these twomonths alone, the number of workers involved, and thenumber of working days lost compare favourably with thefigures for recent years.   It is relevant in making a comparison with previous years to state that Trade union organisation has greatly increased as compared  withthe pre-war position and that, following a-decrease of membership during the prolonged depression in trade,membership has, for some time, been increasing,  and theTrade Unions are becoming more active in seeking animprovement of working conditions,3,   It is also necessary to remember that, as regardsthe two main disputes during the period in question, -viz., Docks and London Tramway and Omnibus workers,negotiations between the parties had been proceeding fora considerable time.   In both of these cases the periodof the stoppage was curtailed by the action taken under/the
the Industrial Courts Aot, and in each oase anagreement was finally reached by conciliation,4.   During the period in question 54 disputeshave been settled through the Ministry of Labour,stoppage of work being avoided in the majority ofcases,   Of these 18 cases were referred to arbitration.

6C 0     Tho groups  of workers involved in the disputes mainly responsible for  the magnitude  of the figures for  eaoh of these years are the following  :-     February - March,        1924    ...       ...    110,000 dock workers.                                39,000 tramway and omnibus                                       workers (London).                                7,000 shipyard workers                                       (Southampton).        1922    ...     ,  ...    1(30,000 engineers (A.E.U.)                                30,000 shipyard workers.        19S1    ...       ...     10, 000 ship joiners and 15,000                                       other shipyard workers. 4        1919    ...       ...    140,000 coal minors (Yorkshire,                                       2otto.

Tfhilo it was specifically asked that the figures relating todisputes since the present Government oamo into office should beoomparod with figures for &quot;similar periods&quot; in recent years,  and the comparison in the foregoing  Table ha3 accordingly been limited todisputes in February - Maroh of eaoh year (figures for April, 1924,not yet being available), it will be recognised,  from the detailsgiven above? that the wide fluctuations in the figures for individualmonths,  resulting from the varying influence of occasional disputes.of preponderating magnitude,  render such a comparison somewhat un-satisfactory.    The Table, Appendix II,  appended  to  this Memorandumshowing the number of disputes reported as beginning in each  yearsince 1897,  the number of workpeople involved,?- and  tho aggregate loss?of working days, owing to the disputes,  in each year as a whole,  has accordingly been prepared as a basis for a more valid comparison.     From the details given in that Table the following particularshave been compiled comparing the avoroge monthly  numbers of workpeopleinvolved&apos;.&apos;: in industrial disputes year, by year since  1897 and  theaverage monthly lossx of worming days owing to the disputes with thecorresponding averages        .......                     /for* Including, in addition to those actually on strike or locked-out,    workpeople  rendered idle,  in consequence of tho  disputes,  at the    works whore tho disputes occurred.x i.o.,  at the  works where the disputes ooourred;  statistics    are not available as to the time lost,  in consequence of  the    disputes,  at other establishments.$ This dispute  began in December,  1920,  and continued  for several    months.

That is., to say, the average monthly number of workpeople Involvedin trade disputes in February - March, 1924, though nearly twice as great as the monthly average over the period 1897 r 1923, was about 17per oent, below the monthly average for  1919-1923; and the average monthly loss of working days in February - March, 1924, was 29  per cent,below the monthly average for the period 1897-1923, and less than  one-fourth of the monthly average in the period 1919-23.  It should benoted that the averages for 1919-1923 are greatly affected by thefigures relating to the great coal dispute of 1921, which involved athree-months&apos; stoppage of work by about  1 million workpeople,k Including, in addition to those actually on strike or locked-out,workpeople rendered idle, in consequence of the disputes, at the workswhere the disputes occurred,t Leo, at the works where the disputes, ocourred;  statistics are notavailable as to the time lost, in consequence of the disputes, at other establishments.
