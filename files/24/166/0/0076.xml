[April 22.](CONFIDENTIAL.                                             SECTION  1.[B  3534/22/16]                      No. 1.     Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby to Mr. MacDonald. (Received April 22.)(No. 256.)Sir,                                                       Cairo, April 1.2,1924.    SHOETLY after the  opening of the Egyptian Parliament,  I was  informed byMr. Keown Boyd, the Director-General of the European  Department, that,  from theevidence he had collected during the previous six weeks combined with the impressionshe had gained  of the temper of the crowds on the 15th March, he had formed theopinion that a state  of danger existed,  that the spirit  of the masses all over Egypt wasripe for disturbances, that there was more than one body of people at work who wouldbe glad to see disturbances take place, and that any incident, however trivial and stupidin itself, might cause an upheaval.   Mr. Keown  Boyd suggested,  at the same time,that steps should be taken  to warn  the Egyptian Government of the dangers of thesituation.    2.  T felt  some surprise on receiving this information, because it  did not correspond with the  situation  as I saw  it  myself.   I  therefore consulted Mr.  Patterson,  theFinancial  Adviser,  who  proved  not  only to share Mr.  Keown Boyd&apos;s views, but expressed the opinion that an outbreak would occur during the  following six weeks ortwo months.  I accordingly asked Mr. Patterson and Mr. Keown Boyd to prepare mereports setting forth in detail their reasons for holding such views ; and I directed that,in the meanwhile, the question should  be  examined independently from all its aspects,and that a number of  responsible  British officials  and private persons  likely to bein touch with public feeling should be invited, in  confidence, to furnish their opinions.    3.  The point to be decided was whether or not there was good ground to apprehendan outbreak in the near future.    4.  My own view, in arriving at which I had  taken into account the risk  thatis always present in  Moslem countries of some haphazard incident causing  a manifesta-tion of an ti-foreign sentiment, was that there was in the present situation no particularlydangerous  factor.    5.  It  is  true that  I had observed with regret  that  the Prime Minister had notresisted the temptation to dismiss from office two mudirs and  some minor  officials whowere known  to be  of Adlist  sympathies,  or who had acted with vigour  against his supporters in  the disturbances of 1919.  I felt sure that such procedure as this, togetherwith the  placing on  pension of Miralai  Muhammad Shahin  Bey, would have theimmediate and deplorable effect of shaking the confidence in the Government of all itspublic servants, and of  generally undermining discipline, and would in the  long runreact against  the Government itself, for in the event of it, in its turn, standing in need of their support, it would find them reluctant to give  it.  But  this spirit of vindictive-ness against  those who do not share their political views is characteristic of Egyptians,and showed itself in  the cases of Sarwat and Tewfik Nessim Pashas.    6.  I had  also noted with interest,  and I am bound to say  with some misgiving, thelicence granted by the new Government since its accession to office to all forms of theexpression of popular and  chauvinistic emotion, and how full an advantage had beentaken of this attitude of  indulgence by the students and schoolboys, and, in their train,by the rougher elements  of the population.  But  I had regarded this state  of things asprobably  transitory, and  as arising  almost inevitably out  of the existing politicalcircumstances.  Inasmuch as Zaghlul Pasha had attained to his position as a  popularleader by appealing  to the undisciplined patriotic sentiments ofthe young generation ofEgyptians, &quot;his soldiers,&quot; as he used to call them, it  seemed to  me that it would havebeen difficult, if not impossible, for him, on acceding  to  power, to deny them the  free expression  of the feelings he had encouraged in them when in opposition.    7.  While I observed that, far from checking  the  students in the first few weeks ofMs tenure  ot  office, the Prime Minister openly encouraged them, I was glad to  see thefirst signs,  as reported in  my despatch No.  215, of the  29th March, that he thought  thatthings had gone far  enough  and that the time had come to restrict the students to the.function he now seems to have laid down for them-that of being the instruments of his policy of dominating the  country, to be used or set aside as circumstances  dictate.  It      [584 y-1]            &quot;                                            B
should be noted in passing that there have been  no demonstrations since those held onthe occasion of King Fuad&apos;s birthday on the 26th March.     8.  In the circumstances, therefore, I was not alarmed by fche expressions of popularsentiment described above, more especially  because, in the  intense excitement thatimmediately preceded and followed the opening  of Parliament, there had been no kindof irritant tiiat might have turned it to hostility  to ourselves and to other foreigners.     9.  I believe, moreover, that it was so clearly in the interest of  Zaghlul Pasha, if he wished, as he had declared, to  convince His Majesty&apos;s Government of his  sincerity, notto allow  any untoward  incident to occur that I  felt fairly  confident that,  unless bysome unhappy chance we might be  brought into conflict with him, there was littleprobability of  any outbreak in  the  near future.   But  I  am  bound to  say that  rayconfidence in this respect is confined to the near future, for, as I have fully explained toyou, Sir, in  my recent telegrams on  the  subject  of Zaghlul  Pasha&apos;s  desire to go toLondon, I hold the view that in the event of a breakdown in the negotiations we mustbe prepared to deal with an  outbreak possibly of  a  widespread and serious  nature, inwhich  we shall  be unable to count on  co-operation either  from the  Egyptian police and army or from the provincial authorities.     10.  Of the twelve persons described in paragraph 2 of the present despatch,  elevenhave declared  themselves to be in full agreement with  my own views, while one  hasexpres-ed some slight anxiety as to  the temper of the people during the first ten days ofthe month of Eamadan,  which  began  on the 5th instant.     11.  Nevertheless,  in view of the opinions held by Mr. Patterson  and Mr. KeownBoyd,  I  thought it desirable to take an early opportunity to convey to Zaghlul Pashathe apprehensions that were  felt in certain quarters.  The information  I had receivedfrom these gentlemen was of too general a nature  to admit of any specific representa-tions to the  Egyptian Government, and I was for this reason reluctant to act upon it,for unless I had been able to produce definite  evidence, my representations might havebeen resented and set aside as vexatious and unjustifiable.     12.  I accordingly sought a  means of approaching the Prime  Minister on anotherissue that might provoke discussion of the question of public  security in general.  Asecret  report I received in  regard to the activities of the ex-Khedive gave me theoccasion I desired, and I instructed Mr. Kerr  to call on Zaghlul Pasha on  my behalf, to convey to him the substance of this report, and to  point out, at the same  time, that theex-Khedive&apos;s programme  presupposes the existence of a  disturbed  state  of  public security in Egypt, of which he  could,  when he wished, take advantage.     13.  This elicited from the  Prime Minister the statement that in  that case theintrigue was bound to fail, for the country was quieter than it had been for years.  Itsstate was, in  fact, &quot;limpid.&quot;   The people  were  happy  and contented,  they  hadconfidence in  him  and  his Government, and  by methods of gentleness  he  was main-taining a tranquillity which in  the past had only been achieved  by  force.     14.  When it  was  pointed  out  to  him that the  state of calm  he described as existing was all the more desirable in view of the prospect of the negotiations  he wishedto hold in London,  he replied that he fully realised this, and that he would give assur-an ces that it would be maintained.     15.  In reply to the  observation that it was widely believed that the  students  had got out of control  and wished  to dominate Parliament and the Government, that themudirs had lost their authority, which had passed to the hands of the  Deputies, andthat underneath the surface of apparent peace there was intense suppressed excitementand  xenophobia, which might explode at any  moment, he said that  there was no kind offoundation in  fact for  such  beliefs, which   were the  result  of  propaganda  by theWatanists and the Liberal Constitutionalists.  This was their only means of injuringhim since they had ceased to exist politically.  But such  progaganda was not  of theleast importance.   The students  were his friends and completely under his control.  Iithey made demonstrations of joy he was not going to stop them.  Such demonstrationsneed cause no foreigner any anxiety.  If, on the other hand, there were any  hostiledemonstrations, or  such  as might possibly lead to disorder, he would not hesitate to dealwith them.     16. He went on to say that he would  be glad to  receive any evidence that themudirs had  lost their   authority.  He  attached no credence  to this  statement.  he spoke, Mr. Kerr tells me, with  vigour and  apparently  in good faith,  and  ended by saying that, in any case, he would give me  his personal guarantee that the country would remain quiet.                                        &apos;                     ,     17.   It is  difficult   to know what  practical value  to attach  to Zaghlul Pashasassurances, but I am disposed to adhere to my opinion that  he will find it expedient,
                               Enclosure 1 in No. 1.                  Mr. Patterson tqx. Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby.(Strictly Confidential.)                                       Cairo, April 2, 1924.  .    ALTHOUGH up to date it  must be  admitted  that since the arrival of ZaghlulPasha to power things have  gone almost more smoothly than might have  legitimatelybeen expected, there are disquieting signs of possible -many think certain troubles inthe near future that I think  it my duty to bring to your Excellencys notice.    Zaghluls  power is based on the support of the  semi-educated students and theuneducated mob.   An organised system of terrorism carried  out by these agents, his&quot; soldiers,&quot; as he is accustomed to call them, brought  about  the election of a Chamberpledged to support him, but devoid practically of all  the  brains  and administrativeexperience of  the  country.   With the exception  of &quot; martyrs,&quot; most members had topay substantial sums to receive the &quot; ticket.&quot;  Of their methods of recouping themselvesI will speak later. -    Victory at the  polls was  signalised   by demonstrations  all over the country.Organised by  students, these demonstrations consisted for the most part of the riff-raffof the  towns.   The police were openly jeered at by the mob, and on the few occasions when they interfered  to protect  private property received not only no support, but on occasions reprimands  from  headquarters.   Officials  who  bad  done their duty  andpreserved public order under previous Cabinets  were ignominiously dismissed.. Bothpolice and officials became discouraged  and  disinclined  to interfere.  Serious disorderwas not, however, for  the moment in the programme, and the Prime Minister, by the aid of the Students&apos; Committee, was able to check the demonstrations.    It was obvious,  however,  that he dare do  nothing  calculated  to offend  his&quot; soldiers.&quot;   He has raised  a Prankensteiu&apos;s monster which it  is  doubtful if he  willever be able to control.  The organism still works at his  bidding and has been employedrecently in terrorising refractory  members of Parliament, both openly by making thementer the  House  through a  double row of  students, and  more  privately by means ofdomiciliary visits.  It is  not without significance  that Zaghlul  explained  the esotericmeaning of  the King&apos;s speech to the students before  he dealt with the subject inParliament.  The speech, needless to lemark, was given its most  extreme signification-otherwise the.&apos;-&apos;monster &quot; would have turned nasty.  In fact  so long as Zaghlul can      [584 y-1]                                       ,.,              B 2until  he is convinced that a settlement with  His Majesty&apos;s Government is impossible,&apos;&apos;&quot;Jto prevent the outbreak of any disorders  in Egypt, and that he is well able to do so.As far as can be  seen from recent events, he clearly has the Houses of Parliamentunder his close  control,  and it would  seem also that the students&apos; committees are equally in his bands and take their instructions from the  Wafd, of which he is still the master.    18. The reports  furnished to me  by Mr.  Patterson and  Mr. Keown Boyd areenclosed herein.    19.  I do not propose to  analyse these  reports in detail,  but, in regard to Mr.Pattersons, it should  be  noted  that he now shares  my view that trouble is unlikely to occur at present.  I should further remark that I am informed  by  Mr. M. F. Simpson,a senior official in the Ministry of Education, that  he  has no information to show thatthe conditions described  by Mr. Patterson exist in the Government  schools, in whichdiscipline, though at  present slack, could be restored  in  a short time by a display offirmness on  the  part  of  a strong  Minister.   I should add that, since Mr. Pattersonwrote his report, events have, shown that the Prime Ministers control over parliament is at present undisputed.    20. In regard to  Mr. Keown Boyd&apos;s report, I would say that I understand thatthe Government  is fully alive to the activities of the Watanist party, and suspects it ofbeing in league with the ex-Khedive.  At the present moment the party is represented in Parliament by some five or  six members,  who form the only articulate  Opposition,As  to the Communist movement amongst the workmen in  certain local  industries,I would refer you to my  despatch No. 232 of the 5th instant, in which I reported themeasures taken by the Prime Minister to deal with  this matter.    21. I am dealing with the  question  of  Muhammad Shahin  Bey in  a  separatedespatch.                                   ,               I have, &amp;c.                                                       ALLENBY, F.M.,                                                             High Commissioner.
 satisfy the students as to the orthodoxy of his opinions and that he has not diverged by a hair&apos;s breadth from the creed with which he himself has inspired them, so long  will he be able to control Parliament and be  able  therein to make  a series of apparently statesmanlike speeches designed to allay foreign  apprehensions.     Schoolboy whims are, however, a  slender reed  with which to keep in check an uneducated  Oriental mob.   Eespect for authority-the only safeguard  in the East- has been sapped.  . Mudirs inform  me that  they can no longer trust their police and that they are treated  with open disrespect in the streets of their own capital. Members of Parliament recoup their election &quot; expenses&quot; by taking money from all and sundry to see their  cases  through.  Armed with lists of such  cases, they walk into  the  mudir&apos;s office  and  order him  to carry out  their  behests.  Should he demur, he is threatened with being reported to headquarters as being anti-Zaghlulist.   Mamurs are in no better plight.  They complain that  they  dare not  give an order to the police to  repress disorder ; either the police would refuse to execute  the order or they feel they would incur  Ministerial  disapprobation.   I  have been told  of omdehs dismissed  because offenders  they have punished  for some  offence,  have alleged that the  true cause of punishment was their having  voted for Saad or having cried in the street &quot; Long live Saad !&quot;  One mudir of a province told me that he had received no answer to any letter from the Ministry of Interior  since the new Government had come into  office,  and omdehships which  have been  vacant  for  months are left unfilled.  Himself when he went to see the  Prime Minister, who was also Minister of Interior, he was kept waiting two hours, during  which time  any  student who  arrived was  shown straight in.  This man and others of his colleagues have informed me that they foresee serious troubles, and they feel powerless to protect the foreigners in their districts.  The administrative machine for ensuring public  security is breaking down,  if it may not be  said in fact to have broken  down.     The second line of defence is the  Egyptian  army.   Apart  from the fact that  t e infantry have never in the past been of the smallest use, and  have quite recently shown that they are unable even  to keep the streets during a public ceremony, with  the example of  Miralai  Shaheen Bey before them not a single  Egyptian army officer is prepared to  incur the slightest  responsibility.     The state of the schools is even more disquieting.   Discipline, for  so many years sapped by Zaghlul through the agency of his salaried schoolboy agitators  (in each school in the country the Wafd kept  a number of paid bullies), has completely gone  by  the board.  Boys smoke in the classes, refuse  to  rise  at the entry of the head-master or ofan inspector, and even dictate  the  names of  their examiners in public  examinations.As practically no work is done, these latter must  he  chosen with care if failure is to be avoided.   An Egyptian secondary school head-master told me two months ago thathe had received an  order couched in  general terms that pupils were not to be punished.Two recent incidents will, I hope, suffice to give  an impressionist picture of the stateof affairs.   The  Egyptian principal  of  the School of Engineering a  man who, I  canpersonally testify, has raised the standard of the school during his  term of office declined to relax discipline.   At 8&apos;30 P.M. one night  he received from the Council ofMinisters an order, for  which no reason was  given, that by  10  A.M. the next day hewas to be out of the school  and out of  the. principals house which he occupied.   Theonly warning he had  ever  received  was  when,  two days  before, his  students  had informed him that they had decided  to get rid of him.   For a week or ten  days beforethe opening  of Parliament the Chamber  was thronged by students, who sat  on  the throne, speechified,  and even  took to scrawling their names  about the place.  One ofthe Egyptian officials of Parliament went to the  Minister concerned and told him thatit would be impossible  for them to get the place  into order for the opening unless  the students were dealt  with.  The Minister lifted up his hands in supplication and cried, &quot; For heaven&apos;s sake do nothing to annoy the students.&quot;     For what I may call the unproductive riff-raff, the army of ne&apos;er-do-wells, amongst whom the  arrival  of  the  &quot; Peopled Ministry&quot;  has led to  some slight  effervescence, nothing much, it is true, has  yet been  done.  They must await their opportunities of pillage, should  disturbances  break out, but  there  was a certain air of  undesirable timidity in the attitude of high Egyptian officials towards, for example, the Syndicate of Tax Collectors  and  their  claims  on belalf  of those dismissed for embezzlement. Uneducated  labour turbulent lot in times of unrest-have had their victory, won by marching with nabouts to the House of the nation or into the arcana of Ministries them- selves.  Their demands were accepted without examination and without discussion, and a supplementary credit of 200,0001. has been hastily inserted in the new budget to meet them.   After such  a facile success, it would be somewhat optimistic to expect that they
are entirely unimbued with the principles of Oliver Twist.  This type of labour is noworganising under Abdel Eahman Fahmy a name of sinister import.     Hitherto, so long as the British were responsible for the administration, the nativeCivil Service  was a body sufficiently powerful to have to be reckoned  with, as hi itself and through  its family relations it comprises the greater part of educated Egypt.  Thenew Government  has deliberately  set  itself  to depress its spirit,  careless of theantagonism thus aroused.   At  first sight the policy seems dangerous and  incompre-hensible.  Egyptian  opinion leans to the  explanation  that  it is merely  to pleaseZaghlul&apos;s  uneducated followers, who have always been jealous of education.   though there may be an  element  of truth in this, I do not consider that the explanation goesfar enough.   It may have a wider signification if taken in conjunction with facts alreadyset forth.   Meanwhile, the  general verdict of  critics is  that  departmental efficiency is going downhill faster than anyone could have imagined.   It may be pertinent, however,to  take note which  are the  services that are being allowed to deteriorate so rapidly.There can be  little doubt that they are the Ministries of the Interior and Education (asshown above) and the  Communications.  During troubles these would be  the keyMinistries.     It must  not, however,  too lightly be taken for granted that the state of affairs into which  the country has  drifted is merely the result of inexperience and incompetence.It may be, and some people think it is,  according to plan.  Such persons believe thatthe Wafd are not guilty of idle bombast when they continue to cry, and have cried bytheir followers, &quot;Complete independence for Egypt and the Soudan&quot;; that they notmerely aspire to it, but are convinced that they can get  it.  It is  said  that  theyare firmly convinced that all they have got is due to  disorders and sporadic murders,and they are  prepared to make one further concentrated  effort to complete their task.Nor is it an empty phrase  that is heard so constantly that  they will  make Egypt asecond Ireland.     If one asked whether Saad Pasha is  not too clever a man to permit  such tactics, the reply is that, even were he  opposed at heart to such a policy, he is powerless to check it.He has been  caught in the machine  and must revolve with  it or be crushed.  He hasshown himself in the past to  be a coward,  and has before  now yielded his betterjudgment to  threats of assassination.   On  the other hand, he is intensely ambitious,arrogant and intoxicated  by the  vociferous adulation of  his  &quot; soldiers,&quot; to whom hepersonifies an ideal the Valley of the Nile for the Egyptians.  He will never risk his present position for the sake  of any complimentary verdict that posterity may pass onhis statesmanship.     As I  have said before,  this point of view must not  be dismissed too lightly.  . I donot anticipate any serious trouble in the near future, but a breakdown in negotiationsmust inevitably lead to the most  serious outbreak  that we have ever had to deal within this country.   Everything turns on the character of  Saad, and he is a Sphinx.  Noother Egyptian but he could dare to sign a treaty which  did not concede the maximumdemands of Egypt.  Time alone can show whether Saad himself dare.  His task will notbe an easy one, as, apart from the difficulties with his entourage and youthful followers,he will find the Opposition  straining  every nerve to break  him by proclaimiug him thetraitor who is selling his country and birthright.  I do not believe that at the momentSaad himself knows  what line  of action he will take when  the crucial time comes.Prophecy  is therefore cfifficult.                                         E.  S.  PATTEESON, Financial Adviser.                               Enclosure 2 in No. 1.          Note by Mr. Keown Boyd on the State of Public Security in Egypt.    ACCORDING to the returns  of the  Public  Security  Department, the  decreasewhich began last year in the number of crimes committed in the provinces  and citieshas been more than maintained in the first three months of this year.   There has alsolatterly been a noticeable absence of outbreaks of violence  owing to family feuds and oflocal riots.  As far as crimes are concerned, although absolute reliance cannot be placed upon the  figures  supplied  by the  authorities, I  believe that there has been a  realdecrease owing to improved economic conditions; I think it is certainly not  due nowtoany improvement in the control exercised by the local authorities or to increased policeefficiency. . It is, therefore, only a  matter of temporary satisfaction  that the improve-ment exists, and we may be certain that if circumstances change anc]  a recrudescence of
G crime occurs owing to bad economic conditions or further causes, no great help can be looked for from the police or local authorities.     It is not to my mind the  state of the criminal classes or the nature of the crimes committed that  call for examination at the present moment, though,  of  course, the Egyptian Government naturally points to the statistics I have quoted above to prove that calm  and  safety reign iD Egypt.   It  is rather the general state of public feeling which requires examination.   During the Yehia Government and up to the  time when the Zaghlul Government came to power, the general spirit  of  the public  was good  and safe.  1  know this from my own  careful inspection of Upper Egypt, from the reports of my officials who  vi&amp;ted Lower Egypt, and from the statements of the  commandants. The Government had continued on the old lines  under the Yehia Ministry, the  mudirs, who, on the whole, were  above the average  of  the  last twenty  years, and their administrative officials were  working fairly hard.   After the removal of martial-law they had powerful legal  instruments which had specially  been created to  replace the exceptional measures taken by us to hold excitement in check, and they were conscious of considerable support from a Government which was openly leagued with the British and working loyally with  them.   Demonstrations, mass  meetings and other stimulants to agitation had been firmly suppressed  for a long period; the people were in a quiet frame of mind, they were tired of politics, and were engrossed in their own  private affairs.   It is true that they were awaiting  the  elections and the advent to  power of a popular Government, from which they had  been taught  to hope for the attainment of all  their  desires.   Among other things, the idea of the division of the land amongst the fellaheen had been carefully spread, and had taken firm hold upon their imagination.     Since  the advent to power of the Zaghlul Government, demonstrations and meetings have been  freely  allowed.  The  demonstrations were for the most  part harmless in themselves and generally peaceful,  but they  destroyed in a few  weeks  that calm, popular state of mind that had been induced by long abstention from such excitements, and there  had been moments when it was not by  any means certain that the spirit of  the crowd would not turn from  rejoicing  to violence.   Such moments  occurred, for example, at Alexandria, when, in the  demonstrations consequent upon  the formation of the Zaghlul  Ministry, the roughs began to throw stones in the Mohamed Ali Square, and when  the  students and others, who were riding in fifties and hundreds  on the trams, worked  themselves  into a state of excitement in which trams would  have been overturned  and other disorders  ensue had not  the  service been  stopped.  Another incident  is that of the crowd outside the House of Parliament on the  15th  March, which would, T am convinced,  have become actually dangerous had not the Soudan been mentioned  in the Speeeh of the Throne.   The attacks on the houses of the  Mudirs of Gharbia  and Menufia after their  dismissal by  the incoming  Government are  also indications of the spirit of the mob.   About this time Englishmen reported  that they had been met with dark looks  in  Benha and other towns.   This was reported to me by Archer  Bey as his  personal  experience  when  on duty  in that district.  Cars were stepped in the region of Tanta by excited persons,  who called on the  occupants to cry &quot;Long live Saad!&quot;   This was reported  by Mr. Berry, of the  Irrigation Department. Fellaheen on country roads round Cairo were reported as  sulky and aggressive.  There were also the incidents of the  attacks on Shahin Bey&apos;s house, the crowd  beating with sticks on Colonel  Fulton&apos;s car, the  holding up of Prince Halim, who was presumably mistaken for a European, and various other similar incidents.    About  the same, time industrial disturbances  began.  These  first  appeared  in alexandria, where agitators, some of whom held Communistic principles, and others of whom belonged to a political  party opposed to Saad  Pasha, seized the opportunity of working  upon the new spirit of freedom  and the hopes engendered by the advent to power of the Zaghlul Government  to work up  disturbances.   The movement took a serious form in that it involved the occupation of the works of the  Filature and Egolin Companies  by the workmen,  who stated that they  proposed  to  hold the  works against any force  that might be brought  against  them, and refused to  move until then- demands had been granted.   The  sub-Governor and the sub-Commandant  of Police, who visited the Filature works  to inform the men  of the Governments decision, reported that the  men were in the last  state of exaltation, shrieking and foaming at the mouth, and that, had not  a  solution  happily been reached, the  results would have been very serious.   The movement subsequently spread to many of the other Alexandria industries, and has  only been kept  in check  by the arrest of the  Communist leaders, constant work on the part of the local authorities in considering  the men&apos;s demands and by considerable concessions to them, pending the enactment of legislation by Parliament toregulate  the relations between  employers  and employed.
     There are indications also  of industrial  unrest in Cairo, where  there has been considerable agitation on the part of the cigarette factory hands, and of certain persons connected with the Heliopolis Tramway Company; reports have also been received  of the possibility of a strike in the  Hawamdia sugar factory, while in the districts  there is unrest among the ginning hands at Mehalla, and a  strike has occurred at the Salt and Soda Company&apos;s works in Wadi Natrun.     Apart from the Watanist share in the industrial  agitations in Alexandria, where the strike of the filature workmen was engineered by an agent of the Watanist partv, the lawyer Suleiman Hafiz, and where some of the Communist leaders, as, for example, Sheikh Safouan, were working in Watanist interests, there have  been indications  of similar activities of the same party in Cairo.   The plan arranged three days before the opening of Parliament, by which  a section of students outside the House should cheer if the Soudan were mentioned in  the Speech of the Throne and should cry &quot; Down with Saad !&quot;  if it were  not mentioned, was of Watanist origin.  The same is thought  to be true of the notice twice  posted  on  ZaghluFs house headed &quot; Blood and  Iron&quot; and containing threats  and incitement; as also of the circular which was addressed to the Ministers and Members of Parliament urging them to be firm in the face of  the enemy (the British) and to continue  to wrest from them victories like those already wrested by use of the pistol and the strong arm, and threatening that if they were  weak, the same bloody hands which had raised them to  the seats which they now occupied would be stretched  out to their  undoing.   This extremist organisation,  which is probably directed by Hifny Nassif and not by the recognised leaders of the  Watanist Party,  is very active and, as is shown by letters intercepted by the Public Security Department, is extending its activities to provincial centres.    Another element of unrest  is to be found in the students whose discipline has now for five years  been  seriously undermined, and who,  from being used as  a political army, now consider themselves as leaders of popular opinion.   They continue naturally to be much used by the present Government, but are not a reliable  instrument, and if worked upon by extremists, may prove a danger.    With all these influences at  work, I consider  that the latent excitement  might  be brought to a head in one or several ways, for instance, some question might arise where Zaghlul Pasha is brought into direct opposition to  the  English ; in this case he would probably be forced by his followers to  resign.  If he  were, it  is the opinion of the authorities  concerned  in public security that demonstrations of anger would be formed and would be joined by crowds of roughs who would give themselves first to sabotage and then to attacks on foreigners.    Another  possibility is that the plans of the Watanists, assisted  by the Khedivists, may mature, and that over  some such  question as that of the Soudan  real  anti-Saad feeling maybe raised and  cries   of &quot;Down with  Saad!&quot; may lead to faction fights, complicated by industrial disturbances, thus giving again opportunities to the roughs. This is  the view held by the Director-General of Public  Security, Kaisy  Bey, who informed me on the 16th March that, in his opinion, disturbances were certain to take place within the next two months.    Finally, we should not lose sight of the possibility of  Saad himself finding himself in an impasse, playing double and secretly encouraging disorders  for which he could throw the  blame on  to  others in order  that, whatever the outcome, he could maintain his role of popular hero.  ,In  case disturbances did occur, the situation would be  very serious, as I do not think any local authority could now be found who would be prepared to take vigorous  and forcible action.   The  confidence  of  the Governors  has  been destroyed  by the summary dismissal of certain officials who had played a leading part in the former regime, such as the  Governor of  Gharbia,  the  Governor of Menufia, the Governor of Alexandria, the Sub-Governor of Gharbia, the Mamur of Mehalla, the Chief Inspector of Police and the Commandant of the Egyptian army cavalry.  I have lately been informed by the Governors of Fayum and Girga that they feel  themselves  almost powerless,  and that they are treated in a  contemptuous manner by the  people of their provinces.   The commandant of the Cairo police is not certain that he could rely on his senior officers, some of whom fear  a similar fate to that of Shahin Bey; he  thinks  that his police,&apos; if they received definite orders from the  Ministry,  would do their best  to oppose the mob in case of disorders consequent on sympathy with labour demonstrations or in antagonism to the present Government, but he does not think that they would act. in case the movement was one of  sympathy with  the Egyptian Government when  in conflict with the British  Government.    Much depends on the attitude of the present Ministry and Parliament in regard  tothe  &quot; exceptional laws&quot; which were  made before  they  came  into power.  They have                                                                 \l
already given instructions fpr Communists to be tried under one of these laws (No. 37)as also for the persons concerned in the attack on  Shahin Bey&apos;s  house.  This latter casecame up for hearing in the Waily Summary Court  yesterday,  but the Judge hadreserved his  decision till  next  Thursday.  If heavy sentences  are  inflicted,  this may do much to maintain police authority, but it still remains to be seen whether parliament will confirm the law.     Persons with experience of the Egyptian army tell me  that they do  not think itwill act if called upon to disperse the mob.   Its spirit is now  entirely nationalist andpopular.  The  only actual  experience  we  have had of  its  work  since  the present government came to power was on the opening of Parliament on the 15th March, when,in spite of  orders given to  troops lining the route to keep the  road  clear, they notonly allowed  but even encouraged  spectators  to come through their ranks and flood the route.                                          &apos;                                                       A.
