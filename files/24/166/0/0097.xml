               Engineering  - General Trade.      SIR ARTHUR  BALED UR  said that Sheffield trade in general showed a steady  improvement and that unemployed were being absorbed at the  rate  of 50 to  100 per week. Anxiety had,  however, been  aroused by the proposal to with draw the McKenna-Duti.es:  the  condition of the Motor Trade was  closely reflected in Sheffield through the production of motor parts and motor engineering tools in the locality      Prices still  remained very  close.   Competition from Germany was not  now as keen as formerly, but French competition was  strong In the European market:   the situation  was  now, however, somewhat better, on account of the  appreciation of the French exchange.   It was note- worthy  that trade  with Germany was now beginning to return to normal  conditions, for the first time since the war: German  customers were being called on to pay cash against documents  at  present, and were not allowed long credit.     The situation as regards  Chinese  trade marks was now acutely unsatisfactory.    It was  no  longer possible  to  askBritish traders to refrain  from registering  their marks;but it must be borne in mind that even when they had done so, they would be thrown  on the mercy  of the  Chinese Courts and had no representation on the  Trade Marks Bureau.     Japanese buying had  fallen off  on account of the exchange situation.   The insurance  position in  Japan wasalso unsatisfactory.  The  Japanese had  not yet  faced their losses consequent upon the  earthquake, and were  only now beginning to put  these down on  paper;  this could not but
                     CONFIDENTIAL.                     General Trade.                                                           Ihave a bad effect on trade.    The  work  of re-building had practically stopped, except  for a certainamount which was &quot;being carried out by private enterprise,  j     Trade with Australia and the Colonies generally was satisfactory.   Some difficulty was, however, beingencountered in the Indian trade, owing to a  growingtendency to buy within India of native merchant houses.Our exports to India fell roughly into two categories;the first, cheap goods for the natives1 consumption;  thesecond, of a more expensive class for the use of railwaysand other large concerns.   Goods of the former class were now being bought on the spot and used for purposes forwhich, by reason of their cheap quality, they were notadapted,     COLONEL ARMSTRONG said that the general slightimprovement in engineering had continued, though it  hadnot gathered much strength.   There was disappointment atthe failure on the part of the Japanese to place the bigorders for reconstruction, of which they had held out hopes.Very few of these had materialised, though he understoodthat ffiey had placed extensive orders in Germany.     Speaking from the point of view of the  Federation ofBritish Industries, Colonel Armstrong said that  there was general satisfaction at the abolition of the CorporationTax.   The general improvement in almost all trades  whichhad been mentioned by previous speakers was  confirmed bythe Federation1s Branch reports, though there was no verynoticeable improvement  as between this month and lastmonth.   Probably the better tendency was more marked inthe export than in the home trade.   (&apos;i  &apos; . -                            -      . Ml     There was, however,  a good deal of anxiety  as to theproposed removal of the Molvenna duties,                           -2-
                    CONFIDEMTIAL.                 Electrical Engineering.     MR. HIRST&apos; said that the general,  if slight,  improve-ment in most branches of industry mas  reflected to someextent in.the demand for electrical products,  but it  hadnot yet gone to the point at which new capital expenditure could be incurred, with the result that heavy electrical engineering had not received any impetus;  in fact,  it was probably less occupied than before.     Export remained unsatisfactory, except to Australiaand New Zealand.                               .  v     As regards home business, complaints were being received that the Governments Housing Scheme contained no provision requiring the use of British materials  only.He would like this point considered.     It was mentioned on the other hand that localauthorities were already pressing in some cases that theyshould not be confined to British sources for materials. &apos;                     Iron and Steel.     MR . BAKER observed that he spoke for the firstprocesses of manufacturing in the iron and steel trade,namely the production of pig iron and steel ingots.     The United States Press reported a slacking off oforders there, but that prices remained steady.     India was preparing to increase her import duties oniron and steel.   A tariff of  2 to  2.10 per ton was proposed in some cases, this amounting to as much as 25%of the price.   The Tata Steel Company was at present in difficulties and could not pay.mi
                     Iron and Steel.     The improvement in the Continental exchanges hadhelped our manufacturers much, and had practicallyexcluded foreign competition from the home market.   Itwas reported that mills were opening  in some parts of thecountry, but closing in others.   His Union&apos;s reports from Scotland stated that the blast furnace undertakingsthere were in a depressed condition,  but on the other handPress reports spoke of exports of iron and steel from scotland as having increased.     Certain difficulties had arisen  in regard to wages.operatives having demanded a wage increase of l/- pershift.   The employers were prepared  to agree to this, buton condition of a longer working week, which the Union wasnot disposed to accept.   He thought, however, that there.was no risk of a strike.     The output of the industry in March had been higherthan for March last year and even than for Maroh, 1920,which had been their best year since  tho&apos; war.   Trade was now better and there was less unemployment than at anytime during the past three years.                          Coal.     MR . EVAN WILLIAMS wrote:-     &quot;Exports of coal to the Continent have fallen steadilysince January, notwithstanding the fact that  &quot;buyers havebeen increasing their  stocks in the  apprehension of astrike.     &quot;Supplies from Germany have increased largely andcompetition from Westphalia is felt keenly even in neutralmarkets.   There is a decided slump thisvmonth in all                           .-4-
                     Goal - contd.     exporting districts.   Prices  have fallen 3/-  and4/- per ton and Collieries have had to stop for lackof orders.     &quot;The prospect is gloomy.     &quot;The position of the export market reacts uponinland business, and there is little fresh buying.Heavy stocks have been accumulated during the past  twoor three months and there will be much lost time at the pits during the coming month.&quot;                  Textiles - Cotton.     MR. HOLROYD said that during the past month therehaa been a fair demand for cotton cloth of the finerqualities.   The spinners of the finer grades of yarn,especially in the Egyptian section, were well employed;and the same was true to some extent of the finerAmerican yarns, but the coarser grades remained in  abad state.   Mills in the latter branch of the trade would be in  great difficulties were it not for theworking of short time.     Cotton futures for May stood at 17d. per lb. as      1*1against 13d. to 14d. per lb. for October and November:the consequence of this situation was that buyers were only taking their minimum requirements at present prices.     It was a good sign that several large contracts.had been booked for delivery in October, November and december.
               Textiles - Cotton - Contd.     He desired to emphasise that the Cotton Trade&apos;sonly real hope lay in securing a wider area of supply for their raw material, and he hoped that the Govern-rnent would do all in its power to assist  this.  A  moreabundant and cheaper supply was necessary to enablethe British Cotton Trade to compete  in the world markets.   He agreed with the President that progressin growing cotton within the Empire  was bound to hesomewhat gradual, hut pointed out that certain othercountries outside the Empire were also suitable forcotton growing, and assistance even  to some of these might not be misplaced.   A visit which he had made toBrazil eighteen months before convinced him that thatcountry was perhaps the finest for cotton-growingpurposes in the world.   Good Brazilian,  land wascapable of growing twice or even three times as muchcotton per acre as the best estates  in the UnitedStates.     MR. JUDSON agreed that the position  had improved in the finer end of the American section  of the cotton trade;  but, so far as the situation could be con-trolled Toy the Federation of Master  Cotton Spinners,short time working was the order of  the day.                                       i1                         -6-
                      CONFIDENTIAL.                 Q3 K                l^xtiles - Cotton (Oontd.)     Manufacturers and spinners were not losing as much money now as they had been a short time previously^ butthere was anxiety over the Egyptian cotton supply, whichwas being affected by the disturbed political situationin that country.  It seemed that the Egyptian Governmentwere holding up irrigation schemes.  The Empire CottonCorporation were watching this situation carefully andwere keeping in touch with the Colonial Office, with a viewto securing an increase of cotton production in Egypt andthe Sudan.     As an illustration of the nature of the Cotton Trade&apos;difficulties, he pointed to the fact that whereas american cotton had cost only 4d. a lb. before the war, the pricenow stood at 17dj as against this, Lancashire has to sellto the two of the poorest races of the world, namely theChinese and Hindus.     SIR EDWIN STOCKTON said that a slow improvement wasbeing shown in cotton piece goods, and the tendency was better maintained than it had been for some time past.Merchants however had lost so much money in 1920 thatthey could not afford to run any unnecessary risks, and so would not buy far ahead.  A good forward trade could be done if buyers could get the advantage of the 5d4 a lb. discount,referred to by Mr. Holroyd, on forward cotton.  Goods were needed badly abroad, but foreign customers would not riskpaying high prices in view of a possible fall.  There had now been two bad cotton crops in suooession in the UnitedStates, but he feared that when a good crop came the trade might slaoken its efforts to secure alternative sources ofsupply, and might be disposed to fall back upon american cotton, on whose quality they knew they could relyj he feltthat a word  of warning as to this was needed now.
                                                      Q*J R                       CONFIDENTIAL.                 Textiles - Cotton  (Oontd.)     A few months previously he had mentioned thedifficulties brought about by the high cost of finishingprocesses, which had held up trade considerably.   Thecost of finishing had been above the economic level ascompared with other branohes of the trade; but now theposition was more satisfactory, though costs still remainedtoo high.  The finishing seotion worked only 3 or 3-1 days a week, and yet made very extensive profits.                      Textiles - Wool.     Mr, ANDREWS said that the price of raw wool was nowsteady.  In Combing there was 25$ under-employment.Spinning showed an improvement&quot; while manufacturers were doing a little better through the improvement in the Prenchexchange.   Some difficulty was being encountered as regardsthe German exohange (though this was probably not peculiar to us), on account of the difficulty which German customerswere experiencing in converting their Renten-Marks intosterling; the consequence was that there was much Bradfordmoney in Germany which it was hard to get back.     The Australian exchange situation was also  difficult inoonsequence of&quot;the seasonal fluctuations of trade.  No blame for this state of affairs attached to the Australian Banks,he thought;although an attempt had been made to  lay theresponsibility at their door, and it might seem  at first sight as if they had been misusing the power which their organisation in a ring conferred on them,  The Banks1difficulties were, however, great? and he thought that asolution should be found by co-operation  ither  between theGovernments or between Central Banks.    The value of Bradford trade with the parts of the  Empire
                       Australian Exchange.overseas amounted to some  15,000,000 a year.  If somethingcould he done before September, in the matter of the exchange,it would ease the position for next year, since Bradford&quot;s requirements of wool would need to be purchased during thenext four or five months.  Money whioh ought to be inAustralia was now in London, with the consequence that banksout there had to  ourtail credit.     With regard to the question of wages, a meeting ofrepresentatives of employers and employed was being held next week.  If the operatives insisted on their demand for a10/e increase there  was a possibility of trouble, but theJoint Industrial Council had hitherto always succeeded in settling 3uch questions, and he hoped that the operatives&apos;demand would be modified so as to make an agreed settlementpossible.     Referring to the Australian exohange question, thePresident mentioned that he thought similar seasonaldifficulties had been experienced in the past in trade withRussia, and he enquired of Mr4 Beaumont Pease how the bankshad dealt with this.     Mr. BEAUMONT PEASE said that the question had beendisoussed at length by the Imperial Economio Conference?the solution generally put forward there, after interviews with the Australian Exohange Banks, was on the lines of thearrangement existing between Great Britain and Egypt, wherebyadjustments are made by the Central Banks in each country, ashortage of currency in the one oountry being made up by an issue against a surplus in the other.     The Australian Banks found themselves in a diffioultposition) funds aooumulated on one side on account of the

This was bound to affect prioes, irrespective  of any action of the banks.,     Mrc ANDREWS mentioned that in Australia the matter wasin the hands of the Board of Issue -  a practically independent body, consisting of three members.  He  raised the question -whether they could not issue currency in Australia against a surplus in London.  It was true that  the Board of Issue seemedto be afraid of producing inflation by  this means, but thisfear was not shared generally.     Mr, PEASE said that the case of  Egypt furnished a goodexample of how the difficulty might be  surmounted.   TheEgyptian exchange showed no fluctuation,, in spite of the seasonal cotton position.  In Australia the present tendencyhad been accentuated by considerable  issues of Australianloans in this country.     Mr, ANDREWS mentioned that Bradford had probably a biggerproportionate interest in trade with  Australia than any othercentre in this country.     The President said that the Banks would no doubt watchthis situation.                 Textiles   Worsted;  etc,     Mr, SUTOLIFFE SMITH wrote:-     &quot;The home trade is still very- depressed, although thenumber of people drawing benefits&apos; in  Bradford from the StateUnemployment Insuranoe is steadily improving, 0.3 the following figures show:-                                      Total drawing benefit.

The looms are runningabout 60$, and the spindles 80$ of their normalcapacity, but notwithstanding the shortage of orders,there is difficulty in securing weavers in some partsof the town.     &quot;The yarn export trade to Germany has been seriously affected by the altered -position of the system of creditsin Germany.     &quot;Good enquiries continue to come from China, Indiaand Japan, but in many cases the prioes quoted proveprohibitive.   There is rather more optimism asregards the South Amerioan trade, but a recovery cannotbe anticipated for the present, mainly owing tospeculation and exchange difficulties.   More turnoveris expected from Egypt.     &quot;It is,, interesting to note that China has onlythe equivalent of a few months&apos; consumption of cotton goods in stock, but with the internal state of affairsshowing very little sign of improvement, and replacementcosts apparently being above the level at whioh Chinaoan buy and consume with freedom, buying is restricted to bare neoessities.

It will therefore be seenthat native competition has made considerable inroadson the trade of Great Britain during the last fewyears.&quot;                     Boots &amp; Shoes.                                                          It     Mr. POULTON wroie:-     &quot;The boot and shoe trade is somewhat quiet, aconsiderable number of our members being on theunemployed list, and a large portion of those in worknot working a full normal week.

0 0NF1 DEHTIAL. Ohemioal3.841     MR. PBRRYaaid that the state of the OhemioalIndustry had shown no marked change during the past three months.  Sulphuric Acid furnished a good index asto the general condition of the Industry - 65^ of thiscountry&apos;s capacity to produce this commodity was now employed.     The Chemical Trade was at the moment principallyexercised over two questions - first, the setting up ofa now British Zino industry by the National SmeltingOompanyj this company would oarry out much of the smeltingof Australian Zino Concentrates which had previously beendone in Belgium.  In the process, Sulphuric Acid would necessarily have to bo produced and marketed, up to some10&quot;/a of  the nation&apos;s requirements $ the older manufacturers of Sulphuric Acid would, therefore, have to aocommodatethemselves to this n*w situation.  He had hopes, however,that the fertiliser industry and sulphuric acidmanufacturers would reach  an agreement with the smelters.     The second point related to the proposed agreemontbetween the British Dyestuffs Corporation and theGerman  Interesson Gemeinschaft.  The outside world had&apos;no accurate knowledge of these negotiations, and theywere giving rise to much comment.  It was a widely heldopinion in the commercial  world that the time was not yetripe for such an agreement;     THE PRESIDENT said that the Government was not a party to these negotiations, but had a power of veto.  Hecould not say anything at  tho moment, as the negotiations were still proceeding:  the Government would, however,watch them oarefuXly, with regard not only  to the effect upon the Dyo industry and  research in this  country, but
                         OONFILWJIAL.                          chemicals.but also to possible secondary effects on the wholeOhemioal industry.  No definite proposals had so far beensubmitted to the Government.  Arguments against theagreement had been laid before the Government which seemed .prima facie to have some force, and, while he could not say that no agreement would be permitted, it seemed olearthat general opinion was hardening against an agreementof the type disclosed so far.                  Shipping and Shipbuilding,     SIR ALAN ANDERSON said that though the Index Figureof Freights was not available as early in the month as this,it could generally be stated that freights had shown a gradual rise since August last up to March of the presentyear.  The upward curve had, however, been getting flatter,and April would probably show a slight drop.  It was ofinterest to compare the figures of tonnage laid up withthe ruling rate of freights; the comparison went to showthat owners continued laying up tonnage after freights hadbe-gun to rise and continued doing so till October, whenthey began to bring ships out again, but had ratheroverdone this.  At the 1st January of this year, 630,000tons of shipping w^ere laid up, as against 410.000 tons atthe beginning of April.  The same thing was taking place allover the world, with the result that the excessive proportionof tonnage released was correspondingly multiplied.     In Shipbuilding there was slightly more activity,perhaps as a result of Government loans.     He mentioned that an international Conference of  theShipping trade was to be held next week in London, at  whichfourteen nations would be represented;  this was the second meeting of the kind.   When the first meeting took placethree years ago many matters were in a ohaotio  state,  but the
                        CONFIDENTIAL.                  Shipping&apos; and Sh? pbuilding;.Oonferonoo had set up a number of Subcommittees which had produced agreed reports on the various matters referred tothem, except in tho case of Bulkheadsj here the representa-tive of the French lines had taken what seemed to the otherdelegates a narrow view.     The most important of the new subjects to bo brought before the Conference wa3 that of flag discrimination. Inthis connection it was reported that the President of theUnited States had definitely decided to defer the operationof the proposed preferential railway rates for one month,and possibly for a year.  Amongst other matters the Sub-Committees of the Conference had  produced an unanimous reporton the subject of dock loads.     In answer to an inquiry Sir Alan said that theConference would not be concerned with the subject of hoursof employment of seafarers.                        Railways.     MR.. BROOKE said that the figures of railway receiptsshowed no increase.  The Great Western and London Midland and scottish Companies were making some slight reductions inservioes                 Co-operative Societies.     SIR THOMAS ALLEN said that it was the desire bothof wholesaler and retailer to hold minimum stocks onBudget Day, with the result that  trade for the last month^had  been somewhat slow.  Generally speaking, the remission of taxation on Tea, Coffee, Cocoa  and Sugar seemed to havebeen passed on by the wholesaler  to the retailer, andthe  view that the cost price of Sugar would advance hadnot  been borne out: in fact, a drop of l/- a owt. hadtaken plaoe at the beginning of this week.  unfortunately the  same was not true of Teas Mincing Lane had taken
                Co-operative Societies.advantage of the reduced tax to advance the prioe ofthe lower grades of Tea by Id. a lb.  This seemedunjustifiable, and he feared that unless a close watohwere kept on the situation, the consumer would lose thebenefit  of the Budget reduction.     As  regards the general furnishing trade, therewas every indioation of improvement.  What might becalled the secondary neoessities of life were nowbeing more sought after than for some time past.  Itwas noticeable that there was a demand particularly for smaller-sized household articles, owing probably to the fact that smaller houses are now being built.     He  thought the time had arrived when, in theinterests of consumers, steps should be taken tosee that the benefit of lower prioes of manufactured articles is passed on to them.  The retailer appearedto be the most reluotant to do thisj generallyspeaking there was no complaint to be made againstthe producer or the wholesaler.  He drew attentionto Mr. Baldwin&apos;3 statement as to the ConservativeParty1s polioy in this respect last week.   Thematter was one of considerable importance  in relationto industries in which wages are governed  by thecost of living figure.     SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR remarked that the  reductionof unnecessarily wide profit-margins on foodstuffswas an important factor in the efforts now being made
               55z2EH&apos;ative Socletiec^to lower British cost of production in industry.     Resuming; Sir Thomas Alien said that the newIrish Free State tariff was due to come into operationthis week, and it was anticipated that the boot andshoe trade in this country wculd suffer considerablyas a result.     The PRESIDENT observed that the Mines department are now conducting an inquiry into retail prices  sofar as coal was concerned.  The point raised bySir Thomas Allen would be noted and considered.Producers, wholesalers, merchants and consumers were all interested to see that the retailer did notabsorb an undue proportion of the benefit accruingfrom reduced world prices, improved methods ofproduction, etc  The accurate ascertainment of costs might present some difficulties in the caseof retailers, on account of the large variety ofarticles in which they deal.     Sir Thomas Allen wished to emphasise theimportance of conducting an accurate inquiry intothe costs at all stagesl such an inquiry should notbe too generalized in character, but should dealwith each stage individually in succession.     MR. GALLAGHER said that the Scottish Co-operative wholesale Society had an excellent report for the first
                   Co-operative Societies.quarter of the year, but business had been very quietduring the last month.  The introduction of the Budget had probably had something to do with this. The Societies had passed on the benefit of the Budget reductions to their customers.  Some of their distributive Branches, such asdrapery, had shown a falling off, but their clothing andboot factories were doing well.  Furniture was in Scotlandtheir poorest Department, in contrast to the position inEngland as reported by Sir Thomas Allen.  He thought thiswas due to the fact that new housing schemes were notcoming forward In Scotland, while the old ones had been worked out.     With regard to the Mines Departments inquiry into thedistribution ooBts of coal, he explained that theCo-operative Societies usually sell coal at current rateejthe difference between thoir price and that charged by private retailers went back to their members in the formof dividend.  This was the answer to the point made by thaMines Department that the Co-operative Societies&apos; figuresshowed a good margin of profit.     He referred to tho tendency to establish an agreementbetween producers, wholesalers and retailers to fix margins of profit everywhere, which he considered a good scheme.It was being oarried out to some extent by tho Co-operative societies both in England and Scotland:  possibly it could also be followed with advantage by private firms.  Therewas, however,  the difference that private firms usuallyinsisted on a fixed minimum price and  not a maximum.
                  Co-operative Societies.     Referring to Sir Thomas Allen1s remarks as to the needfor an investigation into retailers1  margins, Mr. Gallaoherthought that if the facts could be made public, the weightof public opinion should be sufficient to keep profit marginswithin reasonable bounds.     He had hopes that now the Budget was over and the fearof a coal strike had been removed, business in scotland would improve.                Banking and General Trade.                 f     MR. BEAUMONT PEASE said that his Bank&apos;s reports as to  Vthe Btate of trade generally showed a slight all-roundimprovement.     There was little to report in regard to tho money marketduring the last month; conditions had remained quiet and hothought they would oontinue so during the coming month.  Thefall of the United States bank rate to the level of the ratein this country had mitigated  fears of an increase in therate here.  The demand for credits from banks continued toincrease.  There was a possibility of a stringency in dollarsin the autumn, so that it might be necessary to look for anincrease in the rate later.  The foreign demand for oapitalwas now an outstanding feature and had a strong influence onthe money market.     With regard to a question by Sir James Allen as to apossible return to a gold standard, Mr. Beaumont Pease saidthat the responsible authorities kept their own counsel inthis matter.  There was no doubt, however, that, as time wenton, we were getting nearer to the position in which such a return would become possible:   Sir Felix Schuster, in a recent address, had foretold that it was now probably not far off.                                       &apos;i .
CONFIDENTIAL.                 Banking and General Trade.     MR. BARING wrote:-     &quot;Business during the paBt month has been quiet.Money continues in abundant supply, and new issues ofcapital find ready buyers.  In Trade circles the feelingseems to be on the whole hopeful, but buyers in generalare restrained by the undertainty of politicaldevelopments&quot;.                      Australian Trade.     SIR WILLIAM MoBEATH said that Australian tradecontinued good.  The Autumn rains had been satisfactory,and the season was now assured till September or October.Production should be considerably increased as a result.AB, however, Australian primary products increased, so the. present exchange difficulties would increase also.He had been in touch with the Australian Treasury on thesubject.  Since Mr. Bruce&apos;s visit to this  country much attention had been paid to this question, and the Federal&apos;Government was keenly alive to the position.     Mr. Bruce had asked the Notes Board, which was apractically independent body, if they were prepared toincrease the issue of note, but they had been reluctant to do so owing to a view, which was shared by theTreasury officials, that inflation would result.  This was perhaps rather in the nature of a blessing in disguise,since it would,, mean that the responsibility for finding asolution would now devolve on the Federal Government. Hehad pressed upon the Government the necessity of takingsome action on the lines of the Anglo-Egyptian arrange-raent of 1915, already referred to.  This method seemedpreferable to easing the situation by temporary issues of notes.   He hoped to take back definite proposals on this head to Australia.
                         CONFIDENTIAL.                     849                       Australian Trade.     The prosperous state of Australia had created a generaldemand for money which the bankers were unable to meet, and itwas necessary to find some remedy for this state of affairs, whichreacted as unfavourably upon Australia&apos; as upon Great Britain.     It was hoped that the reconstitution of the CommonwealthBank would be carried out this year, and a Bill for thepurpose was to be introduced in the Federal Parliament almostat once, the aim being to reorganise it as a real National Banklike the Bank.of England, the Bank of South Africa etc.Hitherto he thought the Commonwealth Bank had not fulfilled the objects intended when it was set up;  it had entered intocompetition with ordinary-Banks.     Exports from Australia seemed likely to increase in thefuture, and Australians were now looking for other parts of theworld to which to send their produce.  This Increase ofproduction had been brought about in part.by the settlement ofsoldiers on the land.  In order to carry out this settlementwork, the Government had had to borrow.     He believed that the cotton-growing industry would develop into a very considerable one in Australia.  some people even went  . as far as to say that, if the present high prices fjpr cotton continued to rule, in a few yearsAustralia would be turning out cotton of as much monetaryvalue as its wool.  Personally he regarded this as anexaggeration.     They had recently had a somewhat unsatisfactory experience in regard to dried, canned and bottled fruits.  This was probably due to defective packing and grading, a matter whichwas now receiving attention.     With regard to cotton production in Australia, a question was raised as to whether a requirement was not now sometimesmade in Lancashire that goods must be made with Australian
CONFIDENTIAL.                     Australian Trade.cotton.   Sir  William McBeath and Mr. Holroyd  said  that  theyhad  only  heard of one or  two isolated  cases.   In reply  to afurther question whether  cotton spinning  and  weaving plant was  now being put down in Australia, Sir  William McBeathsaid that this was only on a small  scale.     Mr.  Alexander inquired as to the  position of  the producemarkets.   The Government  were being pressed in parliament on the subject of the holding up of stocks of  butter etc., ina rising  market.   This might be taking place  both in Australiaand  on this side.   Sir uilliam McBeath replied that it  was nodoubt true that stocks are held    to  some  extent inAustralia.  The Government had assisted the building of coldstores, which were necessary for the reason that the period of australian production was  a short one, and that it wasnecessary to  hold  the produce for export  round aconsiderable  portion of the  year,                        NEY.  ZEALAND  TRADE.     Sir  James  Allen said  that  New  Zealand was concerned as tothe  fate  of the  Imperial Economic Conference recommendations,and  also, like  Australia,  as  to the exchange position.With regard to  the  establishment of a Central  Bank as recommended by  the  Imperial Economic Conference,  no steps had  yet been  taken  In New  Zealand,  Exchange difficulties  weresevere in Hew Zealand,  as  in Australia.     Flocks had last year&apos;been  increased,  and probably  couldbe: further enlarged,  if the increased demand for  woolwarranted it.   Hitherto dairying had paid  better.     He asked what action was being taken  in regard to  theproposal  of the Imperial Economic  Conference for  financialassistance to  Dominion enterprises,  such  as electricityschemes.
                        c p :-FIDEBTIAL.                   New  Zealand  Trade.     Mr. Alexander replied  that a clause  for  this  purpose  was included in  the  Trade Facilities  Bill, which  was making  good progress through Parliament.  The new  Clause  gave  morefavourable terms than those contained  in  the  former  TradeFacilities Act.                      INDIAN TRADE.     MR. LINDSAY said that  the  Indian  trade position remainedmuch the same as he had previously reported.  Importsremained steady  at some  13,000,000 per month: exports were still increasing.  The  March figures of Exports gave an absolute record  of  27,500,000  which had never been  reachedbefore for any single month.  As  regards trade with  theUnited Kingdom,  it was  a  good sign that the importationof gold and  silver into India had declined from the  levelof  5,000,000 per month at  which  it had stood six or seven months ago,  to a normal figure  of  2,500,000  per month atthe present  time.  This should  result  in an increased taking of imports,  especially  of manufactured goods, and  as 60  percent, of India1 s requirements in  imports had  usually been satisfied hitherto from the United Kingdom, we should nodoubt get a  substantial share of  the benefit.     The exchange position  continued good.     As regards  the advances in the price of  the lowergrades of Indian and Ceylon tea to which Sir  Thomas Allenhad referred, Er. Lindsay thought  that this was due to theincreased demand anticipated from  a reduction of the duty.The price for the cheaper grades had been very low in thepast.     &apos;.&apos;ith regard to the effect  of  the proposed import tariff on iron and  steel, he said  that the possible  output of theTata works was about half India&apos;s  requirements, and It wouldnot be possible  to satisfy the  whole demand from that sourcefor a considerable time.                        -23-

MURRAY wrote:-     &quot;So far as the Par East is concerned the markets thereare generally speaking, at the present moment, in a very&quot;sticky&quot; condition.  Stocks are not, by any means, large, butbuying, especially of Textile goods, is on a very limited scale, and I find that prices obtainable are, as a rule, wellbelow replacing costs on this side.  It is difficult to forecast the future with any degree of confidence  but itseems to me that we can only look for a very moderate business during the next fe?/ months.  The cry in most markets isstill &quot;Your costs are too high&quot;, and most dealers, apparently,have made up their minds to buy only from hand to mouth.     So far as trade in Glasgow and the West of Scotland isconcerned there is practically no change to report.  Theoutlook is gloomy and uncertain&quot;.
