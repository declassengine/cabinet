CONFIDENTIAL.BANKING.     Mr. Baring  said that business  in  the  financial  world  wasactive ancTtEat  there was a  good  demand  fer  credits.  The  finerate of discoivnt remained in the  neighbourhood  of  3^&apos;,  which meant that merchants could finance  their operations  over aperiod of three months at about 4f ;   and  the undoubted increasein the supply of commercial  bills in the discount  market gave evidence of an important movement of merchandize!  This in spite,of the fact that the heavy seasonal shipments of American  cottonto the continent of Europe seemed to have  been  financed, this year,by dollar credits.     New issues  of Capital   &quot;during  the month had been  about 9,500,000 and for the quarter year  36,000,000.   These amountswere very much below those - for the  corresponding periodsin 1923 and 1922, but the totals  for those years were  swelled&quot;by borrowing operations on the part of the home Government,which this year had been absent.  If Government borrowings  wereeliminated, comparison with  former  years shewed no very strikingdivergences during the past  three years.     The rate of exchange on New  York  seemed to have settleddown at about 4.30, some 20  points  below what, dtiring  1922  and1923, we had become accustomed to look upon  as  the normal  level.At the moment there did not  seem  to be any trade influencesufficient to- give the market a decided  tendency in  eitherdirection.     Asked by the President  if he came across signs  ofGovernment intervention in the exchange  market, Mr.  Baring  said:no, the Government operations were  so carefully and  skilfullycarried out that they caused no noticeable disturbance inthe market.     Mr. Goodenough wrote:-     &quot;From a banking point of view  there is &quot;little change  in.thetrade outlook from a month ago, the tendencies then  commented uponstill persisting.  The volume of  loans continues to  expand and&quot;bank acceptances have again  increased.   It may be, however,that the expansion In loans  is due, to some  extent,  to the rapidcollection of taxation during the last quarter of  the financialyear, as it is possible that many taxpayers  find it  necessaryduring that period to borrow temporarily in  order  to meet theirtax obligations.  It should  be remembered also that  the fairly .steady advance in wholesale  prices  naturally involves increased demands for banking accommodation while,  to  some extent,  thehigher figures at which bank loans now stand reflect transactionsinitiated some months agoc  Even when full allowance is madefor these factors,  however,   there is evidence of a rather bettersentiment  and if it were more possible to rely with confidenceupon the continuance of industrial  peace, there is  every  reasonto believe that the scale of national production during-theforthcoming financial year would be substantially  improved.&quot;
CONFIDENTIAL.General Trade.      Sir A.Shirley Bern said that he had recentlybeen in the west country, and heard reports that therewas now less unemployment there.  This was probably dueto some extent to special unemployment relief works putin hand at the instance of the Government.Indian Trade,      Mr.Lindsay said the present was the principalseason in India for exportation, and exports were fully maintained.  The favourable balance of trade was largely attributable to the falling off of imports,particularly shown in reduced importation of sugar fromJava on account of the excessively high price.  Importsof Iron and Steel, Machinery, Railway Materials and cotton piece-goods were well maintained, on the whole.      The imports of Cotton Piece Goods as shown by thefigures of Rupee values for January last were higherthan for many months previously.      As regards the importation of precious metals,that of silver was maintained at an average of about 1,000,000 sterling per month, which was to be regardedas normal: that of fold had declined from the high levelswhich it had reached a year ago.      The recovery in Cotton Piece Goods during the last few months was a satisfactory feature.  Mr.Sutcliffe Smithobserved that India was very bare of stocks of these goods.      Mr.Lindsay said that the effect of the boycottdid not appear to be reflected in the Trade Returns.      It was true that the-figures in his  possessionrelated only to values and not to weight,  but he thoughtvalues had not advanced much in January as compared withthe previous three months, and that therefore theimprovement was probably actual and not merely apparent.It was of interest to observe that In 1922-23 theconsumption of Cotton Piece Goods was almost exactlydivided between produce of the Indian mills (excludinghand looms)  and imported goods.
 CONFIDENTIAL.                    A n^                                  ... \j. jIron and Steel.     Sir Glynn Vilest wrote that he had very little to add tohis report of last month.  The cost of production of steel in this country, however, was rising on account of thehigher cost of fuel, and, In addition to this, there was atendency for a demand for higher wages in the iron and steel industries.     He took a very pessimistic view of the outlook for thefuture of the iron and steel trades in this country, unlesssteps are taken either to exclude the import of foreignsteel, or some machinery is devised for preventing the unfair competition of producers of steel who pay their labour at avery much lower rate than is paid in this country and whoseemployees work longer hours.     Mr. Baker said the position in the Iron and Steel Tradewas very slightly-better.  Unemployment was slightly less inthe Midlands,  The -tin-plate trade was good.  The situation on the Clyde was bad, but more nearly normal on Tees^-sidqHe noticed that the United States papers reported the securing of several orders by British companies:  this was anew development warranting comment.             Engineering  -  General Trade.     Colonel Armstrong  said that the outlook in theEngineering Industry was slightly more hopeful.  Enquirieswere more numerous and more earnest and a few of them werematuring.  This improvement amounted to nothing much yet,and would need fostering, but it was helping firms to covertheir charges and keep their men together.  On the whole the situation was a little more encouraging, and the tendency towards improvement seemed steadier than in the case of previous spasmodic flickers.     Speaking from the point of view of the Federation ofBritish Industries, he said that the reports they receivedwere of a more&apos; hopeful character, though it was difficult toknow what value to place upon this feeling.     The greatest anxiety of the moment was with regard to labour troubles.  In face of the apparently constant unrest,employers throughout all trades were anxious,  and did not know where they stood.     The President observed that there were frequent reitera-tions of complaints in Parliament and elsewhere thai british manufacturers were unable to secure foreign orders onaccount of the low cost of production in foreign countries,He suggested that it might be inadvisable to oall too muchpublic attention to this, and although,  no doubt,  some con-tracts were lost,  there must remain many that we  obtained.     Colonel Armstrong attributed these  complaints toanxiety to impress on the Government the  precarious  stateof our trade.  Firms now had several years in succession of bad trade behind them.     The President said he would have  thought it  preferable to call the Government&apos;s attention privately to the  facts.     Mr. Hirst suggested that another reason was  the  desireto enlighten the British working man as  to the  position.
                         CONFIDENTIAL.Sir Arthur Balfour wrote:         &quot;The general situation is much as reported      last time.         &quot;We are slowly absorbing the unemployed in      Sheffield. Orders are patchy, but on the whole      the Engineer Tool Trade (Saws, Files, Drills,      Cutlers, Hacksaws) is better.  Very little real      profit is being made: prices are very keen and      much plant is still unused.&quot;                    Electrical Engineering.      Mr.Hirst said that the Electrical Industry was fairlybusy, especially in the heavy engineering branch and thedepartments depending on the building trade.  They had.however, for the past eighteen months been without orders from the big industries of the country, such as shipbuilding,steel and textiles.  He was glad to hear a note of greateroptimism sounded by the engineering representatives0  Itwas true that the electrical business was to some extentseasonal, and that&apos; March was usually the beginning of aquiet period.  Export business was almost paralysed^ exceptin the case of Australia, whence more inquiries and someorders were being received.     As regards the adoption of electrical apparatus in coal mines, owners were reluctant to incur capitalexpenditure under present circumstances.,  Inquiries weremade and estimates got out, but the work was usually notbeing proceeded with.                    Textiles (0otton),     Mr.Holroyd said that the labour trouble which wasthreatening in-the Cotton Industry a month ago had been averted.  On the whole, the position was decidedly betterthan at the time of the last meeting,- not on account ofany increase in the demand for yarns, but owing to the.factthat 99% of firms in the American section of the trade were only working 27 hours a week new instead of 48,  This had resulted in some increase in prices.  Spinners could nowlook for, at any rate, a return on their money, if not for a profit.  They were still hoping for a bigger demandfor export, but China practically remained a closed market to us.  If it could be opened up, the outlook would be much improved,     The Egyptian section of the, trade continued workingfull time.  It was not making much profit, but on the otherhand was not losing money.
  00HPIUEHT1AL.Textiles (Cotton).     Mr. judgon confirmed that there was now greaterunanimity in working short time in the American section.The figures of operatives unemployed hod gone up rapidly as a result, since, where they were working in shortspells, or alternate weeks, they ranked as unemployed anddrew unemployment pay.  Till cheaper supplies of cottoncould be obtained, much increase of trade could not be looked for.              Textiles (wool,  etc)     Mr. SutoliffeSmith said that, as regards WorstedTextiles, the situation&quot;remained much a3 outlined at thelast meeting.  Botany Spinners were only running at 60 to70$ of their sapaoity, as at the moment they were meeting with severe competition from the Continent, particularly from Frenoh yarns.  In orossbred wool the spindles werev/ell employed, and this was also true of Mohairs andAlpaoas; in fact it might be said that in these types full&apos;time was being worked.     The weaving industry, however, was by no means insuch a good-position, only 55 to 60$ of the looms being employed at the present time.  Buyers were keeping offbecause they considered present prices high. Specialities,Fancies and Figured Effects made in Jacquard looms werein demand.  Ho believed the Jacquard looms in the Bradforddistrict were very well employed.     French competition remained difficult to meet,particularly in plain cloths, but the fluctuations in theexchange had upset the French calculations, although theircompetition was still formidable, not only in its actualquotations but in its incidence on the general pricequestion.     As regards Eastern trade, the political situationin Ohina hampered business; a strong Government instead ofthe present weak one was necessary before trade oouldbecome really healthy.  It was reckoned that only about one-fifth or less of the enquiries for goods received byBritish firms materialised.     Wool goods, for which the demand in China was increasing, had met with a set-back owing to the accumulation of stocks and the present high prices. Thesehigh prices were also found in the cotton trade - forinstance, a fast black Italian cloth of 30 yards perpiece cost ip/8d. in 1914; to-day the price for thesame quality was 50/-
      COHFIDiJNTIAL.Textiles (Wool, etc.)     As regards India, when buyers were in the market last october and November the price of cotton went up, and soonly a small percentage of orders was placed, but there appeared generally a more hopeful outlook for the future,as that country was bare of stocks.  It needed to beremembered however, that competition from the Italianswho had a depreciated currency was very severe, and theJapanese were also well established at the lower end of thetrade, owing to cheap labour, with consequent lowquotations.     As to the state of employment, the percentage of handsunemployed throughout the woollen and worsted industries in this country was&apos;ll.l in November last:  in February ithad been reduced to 6.6, and it was thought Larch wouldprobably show a further decline.     Mr, Andrews  said that, in the case of wool, high prices were due not so much to active demand as to shortageof supply of the raw material, and the probability was thatin future wool would become dearer, rather than cheaper.Indeed a marked shortage was feared within the next sixmonths.     The Industry was well employed In the lower qualities of goods where conversion costs were not so great.  In thefiner cloths,, where conversion costs amounted to 50/i, theywere unable to compete with the French whose rates of wages were considerably lower than ours.  There were moderatesupplies of wool in Bradford, but continental manufacturershad more, having got into the market earlier and at acheaper rate than ourselves.  At the moment supplies were fairly full, but a marked stringency was anticipated nextyear.     Labour troubles were now being experienced in Bradford,practically for the first time;  hitherto it had alwaysbeen found possible to adjust these matters by agreement;now,  however, while employers had been looking to thenext agreement for a reduction of wages, they were facedwith a demand for a 17/.. advance.  Apart from this, thesituation in the industry was fairly satisfactory.     It was true that the present high prices increased the purchasing power of Australia, where considerableprofits were being made on a small clip, and that theAustralian demand for finished goods was proportionatelystimulated.  This prosperity seemed likely to continue for the next two or three years.  The effect on our exports to Australia would be dependent, to some extentat any rate on the maintenance of the present preference:if this were lost, there was a risk that French and Germancompetitors might capture the trade.
CONFIDENTIAL.Wholesale Clothing.     Sir Robert Glanfield wrote:-     &quot;In spite of the continuous advance in the prices ofraw materials there has been no great spurt in business thatone might expect, buyers generally prefering to await eventsrather than buy ahead, and trade during, say, the last threemonths has been moderate only.    : &quot;For the year 1923 the bulk of business done generallyhas been about the same as the previous year.     &quot;The outlook on the whole is hopeful, and the employmentordinarily afforded is about the same as last year, andthere are few skilled workers out of employment.     &quot;In the coal districts business is being retarded some-what by the fear of strikes.     &quot;Export orders are somewhat better than a year ago.&quot;                       Shipping.     Sir Alan Anderson said that although he was not inpossession of a full record of freights in March, theycontinued to exhibit a gradual risej the lowest point had beenreaohed in August of last year, when the index number of freight rates stood at a quarter of that for 1920: it had nowrisen to one-third of the 1920 figure.:   It would be seenthat the rate of advance was not rapid.     The amount of shipping laid up in the United kingdom had decreased from 709,000 tons in January 1923 to 630,000 inJanuary 1924,  According to his information the price of newoargo steamers had declined somewhat, but the price for specialships had perhaps tended to rise as compared with a year ago.     Though no reliable figures were available as to the stateof employment in the industry, on account of the &quot;in and out&quot;nature of the trade, the numbers of men unemployed seemed tohave fallen slightly.  There had been a rise in the price ofbunker coal.     He would assign two causes for the improvement in freight,rates, namely (l) a greater demand from freights from the black Sea - whether or not due to the recognition of theSoviet Government, and (2) the greater volume of goods nowbeing exported through the Ruhr,  There was also a largeseasonal demand from South America,                      Railways.     Mr. Brooke said that, as to railways,  there was nothingstriking to report.  Receipts, were rising,  but this  was  a normal feature for this time of the year0  There was.nomarked indication of a general improvement  in trade, or  the reverse.rt
ft (- !*Mc.Kenna-operative Societies.     Sir Thomas Allen said that as regards the EnglishCo-operative Societies there was little to report.  It was,however, a hopeful feature that figures taken over a periodof three months showed an increase of some 7% in the purchasing power of the consumer, - whether or not this was due to a genuine improvement in the power to buy, or toenforced buying after a period of holding off.  this increase in business done was to be noted in practically all branches of their trade.   It was true that they were faced at the moment with a lack of disposition to buy onthe part of the District Societies: a good many would-bebuyers were holding off, waiting for an anticipated reductionof food taxation in the Budget.  In the colliery districtsthere also was.less buying on account of uncertainty as to apossible strike of miners.  Generally, however, the prospectswere more hopeful.     As regards the figure he had given of a 7^ inoreasein the purchasing power of the consumer, Sir Thomas Allenexplained that this related to thirteen weeks of the presentquarter as compared with the preceding quarter: he wouldnot regard this as a seasonal development, but as a realincrease in purchasing power.     Mr. Gallaoher said that the position of the ScottishCo-operative Societies was similar to that of the English,as described by Sir Thomas Allenj they had been doing alittle better  than during the previous three months andthe corresponding three months of last year.  He would put the increase in business at from 7 to 10%.  unemployment was not now so bad in Glasgow and on the Clyde.  The fearof labour troubles in the mines had produoed a certainnervousness among buyers, who were only purchasing their requirements from hand to mouth.  Otherwise there was a fairly optimistic feeling in Scotland as to the future.

The Trade Exhibition has apparently given an impetusto the industry,  manufacturers are receiving orders infairly large numbers, though the quantities ordered are on the small side.                         Brewing.      Generally speaking the Burton trade continues good.Wages have been increased during the month by 6/- making thelabourer1s wage 56/- a week.                         Carpets.     No signs of slackening, and manufacturers are makingefforts to execute orders for Spring delivery in time forcustomers&apos; requirements, though in many cases it will notbe possible. Prices of raw materials are still advancing.                          Coal.      Welsh steam ooal continues to exhibit a very strong tendency for all Glasses.  Deliveries are in arrear and the majority of owners cannot take further orders before the middle of April.  Foreign consumers are pressing for supplies and are buying, when possible, at enhanced figures.  Prices generally, are very strong, largely on fears of a strike.                          Optton.      Liverpool points out that though the statistical position is &quot;bullish&quot; prioes have failed to respond, and, on the whole, have tended downwards, day to day quotations fluctuating erratically for no apparent reason.  Export sales have continued good.  Manchester reports that/spinners are securing&apos;better margina, and consequently there is a greater feeling of optimism.  The position is also  brighter in the export trade, the figures representing the exports of high grade cotton goods reaching a high standard.                        Engineering.      The trade has not held the improvement recentlv shewn.  Large orders are not plentiful.                           Grain.      On the strength of large arrivals and hoavy prospective shipments both wheat and maize have fallen in value. With abundant supplies assured prioes during the summer
month will be chiefly ruled by the movements of theAmerican rate of exchange.                         Hosiery.     Both Leicester and Nottingham report steadilyimproving trade with manufacturers looking forward to anincreased volume of business as compared with last year.The chief difficulties  to be faced are the continuousrises in prices of wool and yarn, as it is not foundfeasible to make corresponding increases in the prioe ofthe manufactured article.                    Iron and Steel, etc.     Cleveland pig iron production has been curtailed duringthe month, and. further reductions may be considered necessary as stocks tend to increase.  Business is confined within very narrow limits.  The steel trade is onlymoderately active.  Works are still executing old contracts,but new orders are urgently wanted.  The Sheffield &quot;heavy&quot;industries are experiencing a steady increase in severalleading sections, but the danger of increased fuel costsconstitutes a menace^  South Wales reports that the market for tinplates and galvanised sheets remains good withthe outlook quite satisfactory.  Midland tube makers are receiving better orders and prices have improved.  -                        Lace.     Very little change manifested, the degressionremaining very acute.  The only bright spot is the ourtainseotion, which reports a slight improvement both in thehome and export trade.                       Leather.     Tanning and currying trades continue to be ratherquiet, and the prices of hide3 are now rather easier.  Infancy leather there is a medium demand but no rush oforders.  Harness trade is still depressed.                        Metals%     Violent fluctuations in the prices of copper, tin,lead, and spelter have left values well below the level ofa month ago.                    Shipbuilding.     Cardiff announces placing of several orders for construction.of new vessels within last few weeks, and thatowners are more optimistic in their outlook.  Newcastle alsoreports recent placing of a few orders, but- the labouroutlook is regarded with grave misgivings.                      Shinning.     Cardiff reports some falling off in the volume ofbusiness-and rates receding a little from improved levelslately current.  Liverpool al30 reports a raoession in
OOHPIDSKTIATJ.ratas of from 2/66.. to 7/Gd.  Additional depressinginfluences are found in the re-entry into the market oftonnage recently engaged on Japanese account and themenacing outlook in the coal trade.                         Timber.     The outlook is reported satisfactory, and buyers     **are shewing more activity.  Values generally arestronger.                          Wool.     No particular change to record,  A feature of themonth has been a vary strong demand for crossbred tops. Inthe piece goods trade manufacturers have found it verydifficult to obtain prices adequate to the cost ofproduction, but orders are now coming forward morn freely.-IS-
CONFIDENTIAL.                   ,Annex III.          Lloyd1 a Bank Limited.Report on the Monetary Situation during the            month of Maroh, 1934.     During the past month the three months bill rate has fallen from 5&apos;rS   - t to 3 - 3Vl6  . In the same period&quot;Other&quot; deposits of the Bank of England have decreased by 10.000.000, and borrowing from the Bank has increased.by 7,000,000.  This has been due to revenue collections,  whichhave more than doubled the Public deposits of the Bank(now  27,000,000), and enabled&apos; the Government securities tobe reduced by  15,000,000.  The exceptionally low level atwhioh the Treasury Bills were sold last Friday week was dueto the fact that the Bills mature in the last&quot;week  ofJune, and also to the heavy reduction in Treasury Bills(which show a decrease on the month, of  49,000,000, thoughthe total floating debt is only  20,500,000 lower), and toa lessening demand for accommodation which is attributed to signs of a reaction in trade.  Revenue collections duringthe month amounted to  100,500,000, while expenditure amountedto nearly  78,000,000, the excess of revenue being about 22,500,000, which of course corresponds roughly with thereduction in the.floating debt.  Short-term British fundsshow rises  on the month, averaging about ^fe.  VictoryBonds  show a rise of 1-J.  The 5 per cent. War Loan has risen  by  9/l6. The Budget surplus is likely to be between 40,000,000 and  50,000,000.  I think the prospect of arise in Bank Rate had receded in consequence of events ofthe past two or three weeks; but it is not safe to rule out the possibility of a change in the next few months inview of abnormal circumstances, especially the low level ofNew York Exchange.  Nevertheless I think the tendency of high-class fixed-interest securities will be to rise. TheDiscount Market went to the Bank on Friday and again to-day,the 31st instant.31st March,  1924.
