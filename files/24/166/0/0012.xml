Memorandum, by the Minister of Health.                 The increase In the number of evictions is probably       due:-             (a) to the Aot of 1983, and             (b) to unemployment, and consequent non-payment of rent.                 As regards  (a), the main, if not the only provisions       of the Act of 1985 which could be held responsible are those       in paragraphs (d), (iv) and (v) of the new neotion. 5. ,                 The real substantial change was the removal of  the       alternative accommodation requirement in oertain caces by       paragraphs (iv) and  (v), and the repeal or modification of       those paragraphs would go a long way to remove the eviction       grievance so far as it rests on the Aot of 1085*                 X propose  to meet this case by making it necessary /       for the  landlord to  prove either that there is. alternative       accommodation or &quot;greater hardship?.   This is already the       position in the oaue  Of a landlord who became the landlord after       the 89th June, 1988*  but greater hardship is not at present       taken into consideration in the case of the older landlord.                 I do not think that an amendment on these lines woulds       meet  with very much  opposition.   But it will be necessary       aluo  to  take  power to atop  evictions in oases where orders       for  possession have  been made but not yet executed and such       orders  ,/ould  not have been made if the amending Bill had  been       in force, and there  may be  some opposition to this.                 ;?ith regard to  (b), vis.  evictions due to non-payment        of rent, I  propose  that  these  should be prohibited where  the       non-payment  of  rent  is due  to unemployment unless the landlord        can satisfy  the  Court that  greater hardship would be oaused        by refusing  to  grant an order  for  possession  than, by granting it
          I feel bound, however, to admit that an amendmentof th6 existing law on these linos would almost certainly becontested, and that it will probably be argued that thedifficulty should be met, as it is, I understand, largely metnow in England and Wales (a) by the exercise by the Court of thepower to suspend execution on orders of possession conditionallyon payment of arrears of rent and&apos;(b) by the Poor Law Authoritiesmaking allowances in respect of rent when granting relief.  It iaalso right that I should say that the view of my department is that In some cases Poor Law Authorities in England woulddiscontinue the practioe of making allowsnoes in respect of rent if they knew that the unemployed tenant could not beevicted for non-payment of rent.                       (Intd-) J.W.Ministry of Health.   March 25th, 1924.
