                         /Vat  CAcuLHJ:               9.  (This document is the property of His  Britannic  Majesty1s                           Government).                           CABINET,                      0) (2 LL                                                   &apos;&apos;          Pension Claims of Disabled Officers and  Men^       MemorandumJjtfo.2) from the^Minister of Pensions,          I desire to submit  for the consideration of theCabinet, the following further  Memorandum (No. 2).     1,   Questions affecting the pension claims  of disabledofficers and men are the matters chiefly calling  forconsideration by the Government at the  present moment.   Asthe result of consideration of  these questions, I  have arrivedat the conclusion that on certain of them, action should  betaken which may call for legislation.   In order,  however,that the Cabinet may appreciate the bearing of my proposals,I have thought it advisable to  deal briefly with  all theprincipal questions on which demands have been presented  tothe Ministry for modification of the present Warrants orEnactments,     2,   The award of disability pension involves in every case, two processes:-          (1) the&apos; determination of the officer&apos;s  or man!s              title to a pension at all (i..e*, of the question              whether his ailment or disability is due to or              has been, and still is, aggravated  by his war              service);          (2) the-determination of the extent of  his              disablement (i.e., of the loss of physical  or              mental oapacity,  or the physical or mental              damage sustained by him,  in consequence of his              disability, generally and not in relation to              any particular occupation).Distinct problems calling for settlement arise on each ofthese processes,I. ENTITLEMENT.
I. ENTITLEMENT.          (1)  Statutory presumption in favour  of  claimants.     3.    The  question of  an  officer&apos;s or man&apos;s title  to pension  is  at  present  a question of fact  to  be determined in each  case on its merits.    The demand h-os been repeatedlymade  that  in determining the  issue of  fact,  the Ministry ofPensions should be required by express enactment  to  give every claimant at the  outset  the benefit  of  a  definitepresumption that his ailment  or injury was due to war  serviceunless and  until the Ministry can prove the  contrary.   Thisproposal was embodied  in a Bill which  I introduced last session.     4.    I have considered very carefully the principleof this  Bill in the  light  of  the information now  availableto me, and  I. have coma to  the conclusion  that  I can for themost  part  realise what I feel WPS the  intention of the Billby other means.  I  do not therefore propose to re-introduce.the Bill for the following reasons          (1)  The determination of entitlement as a question              of fact  is,  and always has been, in practice              substantially modified in favour of claimants,              in so  far as both in the case  of men discharged              from service as disabled, and  in the case of              men wKo&apos;^ on  demob ills at ion, claimed d is ablement,              a presumption that the disability was  Sue              to service,  in  the absence  of  direct evidence              to the contrary, has always been recognised              in working.   In these two  classes  of  claim,              about  90 to  95  per cent  of  all claims  were              in fact  admitted by the  Ministry,          (2)  The claims of men who make  their first claim              long after their discharge  from the service              (i.e.,  the men  who are now. making claims for              the first time) are obviously  on a  different              footing.  Some evidence in support of a              claim  that an ailment, now:manifested,              originated in service rendered several years              previously,  is  not unreasonable.   Nevertheless              strictly legal  proof is  far from being              required as  the condition of an award  of              pension.  A claimant is required to do              no more  than produce a prima facie  case  for ,                                                      V.&apos;1                                                      1                                                 consideration,
ft&apos;! OIV ,.. . 1             consideration.   (It is only in this sense             that the &quot;onus of proof&quot; can be said to be             placed up on^ the man).   The Ministry, in             practice follow out any indications of evidence             or testimony which he has given, with elaborate             care and, in the end, the determination of his             claim rests on an independent medical judgment,             with the benefit of the doubt referred to in             (3) below,          (3) In all classes of claim, it is a rule of the             Department (sanctioned by the Treasury) that             where there is reasonable doubt as to the             origin of the disability, the benefit of the             doubt is to be given to the claimant, unless             the balance of probability is clearly against             him.          (4) A statutory presumption in favour of every             claimant would, I am satisfied, place the             Ministry in extreme difficulty, and would             involve a very heavy liability on the State.             The presumption would have to apply both to             claims by officers or men for compensation             in respect of disablement and also to claims by             widows in respect of their husbands&apos; death.             The Ministry would be placed in the impossible             position of having to prove a negative and             (the presumption being statutory) the proof             would have to be of a legal nature.             Moreover, the principle, if enacted, would be so             fundamental a change that it must apply             retrospectively as well as to future claims.             As a consequence, all the claims which have             been heard and rejected by the Ministry and             by the Tribunals in the past (amounting to             over a hundred thousand in number) would claim             to be re-opened.   The cost, it is estimated,             would amount to at least 23 millions a year,             and with the lapse of time this cost would             increase.          The record of the Ministry up to date is thatfive out of six claims made have been admitted.   For sometime past, claims from disabled men have, as would, beexpected, been diminishing in volume, but even now, morethan five years after the Armistice, the Ministry areadmitting to pension 40 per cent of the fresh claims made,or about 190 every week.     5,   While, therefore, I do not propose to proceedwith the former Bill, unless the Cabinet otherwise decides,\jl     I have
I have taken steps to draw the attention of all officersOf&apos;the Ministry to the necessity for sympathetic handling of the claims,   I am anxious to see! that, in particularas regards cases of disease of slow development, suchas tuberculosis, special considsratiCn is given to claims,and the form on which medical board^ report on new claimshas been specially Modified to provide for this,          (11) ENTITLEMENT APPEAL TRIBUNALS:_QUESTION               OTTflJFBpJKTSfl OAflEg&quot;TCTCTl!D ON APPEAL&quot;&quot;&quot;                               BY TRITOALST     6..   A certain number of complaints are regularlyreceived  both by myself and by Members of; the House, fromclaimants whose claims for pension have been rejected bythe Ministry, and, on appeal, by the Appeal Tribunals.,I have, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor^Department,.considered whether some further provision forthe hearing of&apos; dissatisfied appellants can be made.     7..   Practice of the Ministry.   All complaints fromrejected  appellants are investigated, If they furnishanything  in the nature of a new fact or evidence in.supportof their  claim.   While dissatisfaction is expressed Inmany oases, it is nevertheless the experience of theDepartment that only In exceptional cases does it transpirethat an erroneous decision was made,, and this view is confirmed by the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, to which many of the complaints against Tribunal decisions are madein the first instance.   But where error has  been discovered, the Department has, with the consent of theTreasury, been enabled (usually after consultation withthe Chairman of the Tribunal) to reconsider cases rejectedon appeal by the Tribunals, where a new fact  has come to                                              vP       light
light since the hearing of the  case,  and  up  to  date  insome 50 cases  altogether of this  kind awards under theDispensing Warrant have been allowed  to be made by theTreasury.    I  believe that this procedure has met thecases  in which real injustice  would  otherwise  be done if the Tribunal&apos;s decision were maintained.   It  may not,however, meet  all cases and is  certainly  open to  some criticism in so far as it enables the Minister  of pensions to award a pension notwithstanding that,  by  statute, adecision of the Appeal Tribunal is final, and so  appearsto set the Minister above the Tribunal.     8.   The  decision of a statutory court  should,strictly speaking, only be set  aside  by another court.If this is to  be done, however, legislation  is  necessary.In view of the possibility that the Government  may agreeto legislate on the matter, I have carefully consideredwhat form such legislation should take.     9.   To give all unsuccessful appellants a generalright to claim a retrial of their cases on the  simpleissue of fact  which has already been considered and determined by  one of the existing Tribunals  of  appeal would not be in accordance with Constitutional  legalpractice, and  would be administratively unsound.   Forexample, under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts, a litigantcannot claim to go to the Court of Appeal on the  questionof fact which  has been settled on an issue of law.   Onthe whole I believe the existing Tribunals have dischargedtheir duties with fairness and care,  and  Ex-servicemen1 sAssociations have expressed their satisfaction  with  theworking of the system.   It is highly improbable  that  anybut a fraction of unsuccessful  appellants who made a                                                 further
 further appeal  would be likely to  succeed.    To  have a retrial in every one  of the  many thousands  of  claims which have been rejected in the past years  would only lead to false expectations which would  not be  justified  in the vast majority of cases.    10.    On the other  hand,  every unsuccessful  appellant should be given a right to have his case  reconsidered if he can show grounds for reconsideration.    I  am  advised that it would be practicable to provide by legislation for a formal rehearing of rejected appeals in such  cases, viz., in those cases  where the appellant could  show that  either  -     (l)   (a)  some new  fact had come to light since the             hearing of the original appeal,  and          (b)  that the  fact is material to  the Issue, and          (c)  that it could not by reasonable diligence             have been submitted,  at the  hearing before              the Appeal Tribunal;   or     (2)   that  the Tribunal had acted perversely;   or     (3)   that  the whole proceedings before it had been          so unsatisfactory that in effect  there had been          a mistria!. very unsuccessful appellant would thus have  an  opportunity of putting up his claim again for  rehearing on any  one ofthe foregoing grounds.    For the purpose  of determining whethera case was suitable for rehearing  on any  one  of  the foregoing grounds  it would be possible to set up a.  Referee or Court  of referees  to be  composed of men of  standing  in the legal profession,with the  assistance of  on9 or  more  medical  assessors who would examine  the cases submitted (having before   hem  the written records,the note  of the hearing before the  Tribunal,  and any written statemenjss by the claimant and the  Ministry)..    If then theReferee  or Court thought fit,  they  would  give a  certificatedirecting the case to be reheard by one of  the existingIribunals,  other,  of course than the  Tribunal which originallyheard the case.
11,    I  am bound to point out  two consequences whichmust result from the Institution of a statutory rightto  rehearing: -         (a) Any such right that may be given to             unsuccessful appellants should logically also             be given to the Ministry,  as the other party             in the case.   Though the right would probably             not often be exercised by the Ministry, cases             have occurred in which (had any statutory             court of decision existed) the financial             authorities would have deemed it necessary,             in the interests of public funds, to contest the             correctness of the Tribunal&apos;s decision.   This             would mean the cancellation of pension in             certain cases where they had been awarded.         (b) Further, the institution of a statutory claim             to rehearing would necessarily mean that this             must be the sole remedy in cases of complaint,             and the Ministry would be precluded from             dealing directly with cases.   Gases could only             be dealt with under the precise conditions laid             down by the statute, and these would require to             be interpreted in their strict legal meaning,    12.   On the grounds I have indicated former governments have come to the conclusion that the institution of a statutory right of rehearing was not advisable.   If theCabinet now decide otherwise I  tiiink the plan indicatedin paragraph 10 is the most satisfactory solution of theproblem.   The cost cannot, I understand, be estimatedwith any accuracy, since any estimate must depend upon thevolume of work which the Referee or Court of Referees andthe Tribunals may be called upon to do.   At the same timeadditional work (requiring additional staff) would beentailed on the Ministry of Pensions.   About 100,000appeals in respeot of entitlement (and about 37,000 appealsin respect of assessment) have been rejected by the Tribunalsbut how many would appeal for rehearing it is Impossible tosay, though the number would probably be large.                                                      Time
          TIMB LIMIT  OF 7 YEARS ON  FRESH CLAIMS,    13.    Section 5 of  the  War  Pensions Act,  1921, imposed a time limit of 7  years from the date  of the  terminationof the officer&apos;s or man&apos;s active service,  or  the  terminationof the wer (i.e.,  September 30th, 1921) whichever was theearlier;  beyond which it  is not in  the power  of the Ministryof Pensions to entertain  a  fresh claim for disablement by war service.    It has been  suggested that  this terminaldate should be removed.  A terminal date  for fresh claimswas imposed on the ground that,  with the lapse of time, itwould become impossible to  sift the evidence  in respect ofclaim for disablement,  and  it has undoubtedly the advantageof securing that good claims are submitted within a period which will allow of evidence for or against the claim beingobtainable.   The terminal  date has been widely advertised.I am advised that generally a period of 7  years afterdischarge is fully sufficient time  to  allow for the firstmanifestations of any disability genuinely due to war service,and it must be remembered that  the  time limit does not barfurther consideration of  a  claim that  has  once been made within the 7 years.  An  occasional case outside  the seven years time limit occurs now but the terminal  date cannotoperate in the vast majority of cases  before  another two years.It will be for the Cabinet  to consider whether Section 5 shouldbe amended if it is decided that legislation  for  other purposes should be undertaken.          It would probably in  any  case be advisable to insert a provision making it clear  that the Treasury, in concert with the Minister of Pensions, have a discretionarypower to make awards  in cases in which the seven  years time limithas expired but they  are  satisfied  by  their medical advisersthat the disease or injury  was  actually due to War service.
               (ii) ASSESSMENT QF DISABLEMENT . -      14.   The outstanding problem  in connection with assessment is that of Final Awards.      15.   The system of Final  Awards was  instituted by Section 4 of the \&quot;iar Fensions Act,  1921..    It  was the view  of the Government that in the great majority  of  cases, the officer&apos;s or man&apos;a claim for compensation  in  respect of disablement by war service, could be finally  settled, by the fixing of  a pension or otherwise, as the  case required, after  some years had elapsed since  the  original claim. when  a man&apos;s claim to compensation  for  war disablement is first  admitted,, he is given a rate  of pension  appropriate to the ascertained degree of disablement,  and  is thereafter medically examined at intervals of  six  months  or a year, receiving also, in the intervals, whatever treatment is necessary to improve his condition.  The  result Is that in a majority of  cases, the man&apos;s  natural  powers  of recovery, together with  such treatment as has been given, tend to improve his condition and decrease  the  extent  of disablement, with  the consequence that in about  three-fourths of all the cases  it was found  (and, indeed,  is still  found) that the disablement remains stationary  or gets  less.  ...      16.   A final award is by  Ministry Instruction only made  where the  case.is considered medically suitable&apos;for it. The Ministry1s medical staff are  instructed to take a view of the future  of each case as far as possible, as well as of its past, and only to make a final award where on a.reasonable estimate of its future an award could be made which would fairly.compensate the normal and  average condition of the case as the direct result of  war service. In a  very large number of cases, the medical  boards have found themselves precluded from making  final  awards because                                            .7            the
the oases were likely to get worse.   On the other hand, wherea man who has had a final award becomes worse, it is alwaysopen to him to claim a course of medical treatment (withallowances at the maximum rate of pension).   In every case wherea final award is made, the officer or man has a right of appeal against the award to one of the independent Tribunals withina year.     17,   The scale on which assessment is calculated Is, ofcourse, that of the Warrant, and the Ministry Warrants, fromthe outset, have been drawn on the principle that for minordisablements assessed at less than one-fifth of total Incapacity(i,e., under 20 per cent) compensation is payable, not in theform of a recurring pension, but in the form of a gratuity,which may be paid either as a lump sum or as a terminableallowance for a specific period (i.e. a final weekly allowance).   jIt is from that class of case which, has received either a gratuity or a terminable allowance because the assessment was less than 20 per cent - not to any material extent from the class which has received a final award of pension - that complainthas arisen,&apos;     18.   The principle of final  settlement of compensation wes,I should add, instituted at the instance of ex-service men, andwas accepted without a division by the House of Commons.     19.   The complaints that have been made fall under threeheads, viz:-      (a)  complaints from men viho have appealed, but           whose claims have been  rejected;      (b)  complaints from men who did not realise that           they had to appeal within a year, until that           period had expired;      (c)  complaints, in a very few cases, that men           who have had final awards are now worse,           but that, the award being final, they can           get no more.     20.   As to class (a), it would be possible to apply the same procedure for rehearing in a limited number of cases,                                                          as
as  I have outlined  in  para.  10  above.    This would form part of the legislation  which would  be  required if alimited rehearing on the  question  of entitlement were provided by legislation.    On the  other hand, I can dealydth most of  these  cases  administratively (without legislation)  with the  concurrence  of the Treasury, on thelines  indicated  as  regards  entitlement  cases in para, above.    21,   Class  (b) is,  of course,  a difficulty inherent in  any scheme which contains a  right of appeal limited in point  of time.   In all  cases 7/here  final awards have beenmade  since August,  1921,  a  specific  notification has been addressed to  the man calling his -attention, in terms, to theright  of appeal, and to  the necessity  of exercising itvdthin a year from  the notification.   I am, however,endeavouring  to  arrange,  through the Treasury, for cases to  be  heard  where the  man was prejudiced by illness orother  unavoidable  cause,  from putting  forward his appealvdthin the proper time,  and this will  meet a large bodyof  the eases.     22.   . The case of complaint referred to under (c),(i.e., of men who  claim to  have got  worse) is more difficult.Most  of such cases  are,  of  course, cases which could bedealt  with effectively by a course of  treatment withallowances,  and  no  alteration of final awards is called for,4 further  group of  these cases  consists of cases inwhich the final award  was a manifest error.   There are bound to be  occasional cases of error.    The final awardwas,  of course,  a medical judgment,  the accuracy of which is necessarily  dependent  on the exactness  of the diagnosis andprognosis  of a case.   These cases I can deal withadministratively,  on the lines  indicated in para, 24 below,
     23.   This will not, it  is true,  altogether meet thelarger claim which has been put forward, viz., that aworsening in the.man&apos;s condition  at  any time  subsequent to -possibly many years after - the final  award,  should carry with it an alteration of that  award.   This claim, whichhas been raised in the House  on one  or two occasions, is,however, seriously at variance with  the whole scheme of final awards as a final settlement of  claims fordisablement.   In the, first place a  final award  (provided,of course, that it has been correctly  made) is final bothagainst the State and against  the mano   If the man canclaim an increase of the award, the  State should logicallybe able to reduce it where the award is found to be inexcess of the amount clue to the man  in the light of hisimproved condition.   Final Awards have been made on thebasis of an average condition  and represent an averagecompensation, and cases may well  be  found to be at timesbelow as well as above that average  condition.   But ifthese are to be recognised, this  involves the cancellation of finality of all final awards,  in the case of all theofficers and men (about 240,000 at the present time) whohave got final awards of life  pension.   This would causegrave discontent as a breach of faith  on the part of theGovernment.   I am not in favour  of abolishing the systemof final awards, given an equitable and reasonably elasticadministration of the Act.   Already the Ministry have obtained from the Treasury sanction to make an increasedaward under the Dispensing Warrant in the few oases where,owing to a breakdown of an amputated limb, a furtheroperation is necessary resulting in increased disablement,Gases of disease in which, owing to unforeseen developments,the man becomes a hopeless Invalid as a direct consequence of
his war disability will,  if they have been  made final, nodoubt be similarly dealt  with,  if they  are  not  (as nodoubt will Usually be the case) adequately  compensated by medical treatment with allowances at the maximum  rate ofpension under our existing powers.   3h any case  legislation(by way of amendment of Section IV of the War pensions act, 1921), would be necessary  if the claim I refer to wereto be generally admitted.   There is, however, at present no serious or widespread  demand for it, and the claim hasnot been put forward by the British Legion, who,  apart fromthe case of the man with a leas than 20 per cent, award,have expressed themselves satisfied with finality of settlement.   Beyond doubt, a very heavy additionalliability is involved if  statutory machinery for the indefinite review of awards now made final, were to beinst itut ed,     24,  I summarise, therefore, the  issues involved inrespect of final awards for consideration of the  Cabinet.The issues are -     (a)  Whether the Ministry  shall continue to  proceed          by administrative action,, to  correct  errors and          deal with individual  cases while  maintaining the          system of final awards;  or     (b)  whether legislation is necessary  and should be          undertaken to deal with the  difficulties.          As regards  (a), Administrative Actionji-          I have obtained the concurrence of the treasury to  a procedure, for remedying errors of  final award  in caseswhere the remedy of appeal to the Appeal Tribunal hascea.sed to be available.   This  will enable  me to  dealwith cases which arise in the course of treatment,  or on                                           represaitation
                                                        to o c*representation from War Pension Committees and. others,in which, upon examination, it  is found that  the officer or man has in fact beai given,  owing to faulty or incompletediagnosis, or other error of medical fact, a final awardwhich cannot be held to represent the considered judgment of the Ministry and its medical advisers as to the finalassessment of the case.   Some modification of the Regulationmay be necessary to give formal effect to this procedure,and this I am considering, but, in the meantime, I have put this procedure into operation.   I aru assured by myadvisers that it will meet substantially the currentcomplaints.          Alternatively, as regards  (b), Legislation          It is possible, and the Cabinet may considerit desirable, to proceed at once by way of legislation.Provision merely for the rehearing of cases that havebeen rejected on appeal to the Assessment Appeal Tribunals(by a procedure similar to that referred to in para. 10above in cases of entitlement) would, in my view, not cover the whole ground.   A  substantive amendment of Section 4of the War Pensions Act, 1921, to provide for an increase ofaward in  any case where It could be  shown by the officer or man that he was suffering from an  extent of disablementseriously and permanently greater than the final awardoriginally made him, would certainly be pressed upon theGovernment, and I doubt if in  present  circiimstaxices itcould be resisted.

I sutiraarise briefly for convenience, the points which I  have submitted herein for consideration                                      o                                     1,,  EOTITLEMJFT.

Final Awards  ................    14-24           In view of the importance of the considerations, both financial and administrative,  that  are involved  in the foregoing matters,  I should be  agreeable that  the problems I have raised in this  Memorandum should be referred to a small Cabinet Committee,  if that  course should be considered advisable.      26.  Complaints on some further points of  the Pension Warrants and administration have been brought to ray notice, which should, I think,  be considered by the Government.   These I propose to deal with in a further Memorandum,                      ;                        (SGD)    FRED .  0.
