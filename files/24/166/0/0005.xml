Wages Negotiations in the Coal Mining Industry.     The progress of events since I reported to you on the15th instant has been as follows.     I met the men on Thursday morning and discussed&quot; withthem in detail their claim and the owners proposal.  I found clear indications that a large number of them, if nota majority, were in favour of an industrial settlementrather than legislation, and I tried to foster this feeling.     In the afternoon I met the owners and explored withthem the possibility of further concessions.  It was clearthat, on the main points of the claim, they had meant whatthey said when they declared that they had already gone tothe furthest possible limits of concession.  But itappeared possible that one or two further minor concessions on points of  detail might be made.     On Friday morning I met the men again and advisedthem to meet the owners.  They fell in with this suggestion,and met them on Friday afternoon,  I was not present, butI understand that the meeting was devoted to an examination in detail of the points of difference, without either sidemaking any advance.     They meat again this morning, when I understand theowners will indicate to the men any further minor concessions on points of detail that they may feel able to make.  Themen will then report to their delegate conference on Wednesday,     Both sides have agreed&apos;to report to me after their meeting to-day,                                 (Signed) E, Shinwell.25th March, 1924,
