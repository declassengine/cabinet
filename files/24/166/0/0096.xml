                                                                ail(THIS DOCUMENT IS THS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).                             CABINET..,p .295(24).      EDUCATION  (SCOTLAND)   (SUYiMNUATION)   BILL,  1924.MEMORANDUM BY THE PRES DENT OF THEBOARD OF EDUCATION.Very Urgent.1.        The Secretary for Scotland asks the Cabinet to agrna:-     (1)  to alter the date in tha Education (Scotland) (Supar-          annuation) Bill, 1924, from the 31st March, 1926, to          July 31st, 1925.     (2)  He asks also that the Government should now stats that          it accepts the contributory proposals of the Emmott          Report.          I would remind the Cabinet that, after long discussionwith the Treasury and in the Home Affairs Committee, and inthe Cabinet, the date (March 31st, 1926) was decided upon.   explained the reasons quite clearly why it was absolutelyimpossible for us in England to have an earlier date, becausethe main thing that matters at the present time in England  andWales is to get a settlement on salaries as between the LocalEducation Authorities and the Teachers, and, until that is done, neither of the parties are.ready to consider making a contributory system permanent.  This, I repeat, was acceptedby the Cabinet.  On ths strength of that the English (Suner-annuation) Bill has now passed all its stages in th* House  ofCommons and has gone to ths Lctds.  The negotiations betweenths Teachers and Local Education Authorities upon, salaries  are-just about to begin and to try to alter the situation now after it has been accepted by the House of Commons would be dangerousin the extreme to this salary settlement.
          2.   There is not, moreover, the remotest chance that, as     things are, the Looal Education Authorities in England and     &quot;iVales will accept the proposition of the Emmott Committee.     (I cannot entertain the suggestion that Local Education     Authorities should be required to contribute to the cost of     pensions but that thoy should bo compensated by increased grants.     The whole object of making Local Education Authorities contribute     is to make them&apos;feel financial responsibility for teachers     pensions by having to pay for them.)   It will be the beginning     of next year before, under the most favourable circumstances,     a situation can. be reached which will enable us,  with any     certainty, to decide on the form which the Superannuation Bill     shall take for England.          3,   The Scottish situation appears to me entirely different     and,  if they like,  I do not see why they should not act     separately.   If they wish to bring in a Bill nest Session,  I can     offer no objection,   It is possible that,  by that time,  although     we in England may not be as ready as they are,  we may know     the lines upon which we are ready to go*   But further than     that it is not possible to see at present,  and I  must therefore     ask the Cabinet to maintain its original decision with regard     to the English Bill, which the House of Commons has already     accented, and not to nress me to take the exceptional measure     of fundamentally altering it after it has  passed  the House  of     Commons.                                         CHARLES TREVELYAN.Board of Education,     Whitehall,13th May,  1924,2.
