        WAGES NEGOTIATIONS IN THE OPAL MINING INDUSTRY.            Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.     The following is the story of events sinoe I reportedto the Cabinet on the 25th Maroh.     On Wednesday the Miners1 Delegate Conference adjournedafter passing the following resolutions-       &quot;We authorise our Exeoutive Committee to meet     the owners with a view to negotiating final terms     for referenoe to the conference and for submission     to the men.&quot;     In pursuanoe of this resolution a joint meeting betweenthe owners and men was held on Thursday morning, and a seriesof oonferfenoes ensued whioh lasted until 8,15 in the evening.Frequent adjournments were made for eaoh side to confer apart,and I was in touch with eaoh alternately throughout the afternoon.     The owners began by asking that the men should make some advance, and indicate the minimum that they were preparedto reoommend to their Conference.  The men compliedj andafter some further diaoussion the owners put forward a finalamended offer.  In this way the differences between the two sides were narrowed in the manner shown below:-5leot.

The decision of the Conference thatfollowed was reported to me in the following terms:-
       &quot;The Executive Committee deolded by a majority  vote to recommend to the Conference for adoption the  following resolution.       &quot;That it be a recommendation to reject the terms  now offered as providing no solution of the miners&apos;  wage question generally, nor giving the immediate relief  so vitally neoessary., and calls upon the Government to  institute an inquiry into:-       (a) The wages of miners compared with their            1914 wages.       (b) Compared with the cost of living index            figure, and       (c) Compared with the wages now prevailing in            industry generally.&apos;       The Conference adopted the recommendation and decided  to ballot the members of the Federation upon the issues,        1. The acceptance of the proposed terms of            settlement.        2. The rejection of the terms and the acceptance            of the Inquiry procedure as set out in the            reoommendation.&quot;     I understand that the ballot will be taken on the8th April and the result will be known on the 10th.  Thereis just a ohance that it may result in aoooptance of theterms, but this is unlikely.   It is probable that the re-oommendation of the Conference will be confirmed.  In that event I shall ask the Minister of Labour at once toset up a Court of Inquiry, in accordance with the authorityalready given by the Cabinet.   I shall consult &quot;withMr. Evan Williams and Mr. Riohards during the present week in the hope of arriving at agreed terms of referenoe.     It has been agreed between the two sides that presentwages will oontinue to be paid after the 17th April andthat effect will be given on the 1st May to any changes in wages; rates that may be due under the working of the oldAgreement.  No strike can constitutionally take place without a further .ballot.     One result of the decision of the Delegate conference is, of course, to postpone any&apos;;question of legislation at
any rate until the report of the Court of Inquiry  hasbeen issued,                         E.  Shinwell.1st April,  1924.
