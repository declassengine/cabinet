  THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF  HIS BRITANNIC fcAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                            CABINET.                               9 r) o         ROYAL C OMISSION   OH  NATIONAL  HEALTH INSURANCE.                                                             Copy No. 45 CfiBT-.                MEMORANDUM  BY  THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.   &quot;&quot;^ ^&quot;245(24) .1 &apos;----   It is necessary  to  decide  the terms of reference  and the  composition of the promised  Royal Commission on National Health  Insurance, so that the Commission may be set up as soon as possible  after the Insurance Bill  now before  Parliament becomes law.          I request approval  of the   following terms of reference -     &quot;To inquire into the  scheme of National Health Insurance     established by the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911-1922,     and to report what, if any, alterations, extensions or     developments should bo made in regard to the scope of  that     scheme and the administrative, financial and medical arrange-     ments set up under it.&quot;  These terms of reference  accord with, the undertakings given by our  predecessors to the doctors  in tho course of the negotiations as to  the capitation fee and se3m  to mo to cover the whole of the ground  appropriate to this particular Commission.  The terras are  acceptable  to the doctors and to the  Committee  of the Approved Societies  Consultative Council appointed to deal with the question.          As regards composition,  tho Commission - (1)  can  be entirely I composed of impartial persons,  or (2)  can contain representation of  the interests concerned plus an Impartial element.          The late Government includod a promise of an impartial 1 Commission In the final offer  as  to  the capitation fee made to the 1  doctors by the late Minister of Health on the 31st of October, 1923.  In concurring with the draft terms of reference to the Royal Commission, I the doctors refer&apos;to this  promise and press for an impartial Commission.          On the other hand,  tho Committee of the Approved  Societies iConsultative Council take  the  view that there should be  included in I I the Commission persons whom  they  define as persons  having  knowledge of j the subject but who would in fact be interested persons.          If the first view is  adopted,  It would bo  possible to have a  Commission of say 6-8 persons,  who would require  to be very carefully  selected people of such high standing as to cormftand public confidence.  Expert knowledge would be  afforded by a secretarial staff  appointed                                   1.i-&quot;1.. Il &apos;      *v/&quot;VWfu &quot;V^RW catessS?
                                                                ? J 9from this Ministry and all interests concerned would make  their casein evidence, being assisted with facts by the Department as far as necessary        If the second view is adopted, the numbers of  the commission would probably rise to at least 20, as follows:-    Doctors .............................*.........&quot;    *    Insurance C ommittoes............................    1    Officials (England, Scotland &amp; Northern  Ireland),    5Some of these numbers are minimum numbers  and we  should need to add an element of impartial persons amounting to  at  least  6, which numberagain might In fact have to be increased to provide for female repre-aentation and possibly for representation  of  dentistry  and of those branches of medicine and of general Insurance which are not at presentconcerned with the specific problem of National Health  Insurance.        The particulars In the last paragraph illustrate the strengthof the case for an impartial Commission of the type first mentionedabove, so far a3, efficiency and case of working is  concerned.  If aCommission of the second type is appointed, the proceedings will consistto a material extent of disputes between interested parties,,  they willbe protracted by a series .of needless and  tendencious questions, morethan one report may be expected and the carrying  into effect of recommendations will be delayed by the mobilisation against them ofthe interests whose views have been given  the publicity of a minorityreport but are not accepted by tho Government of  the day.  It Isfurther to be remembered that the bargain  with the  consultative council as to finding money for the increased capitation fee is athree years bargain, i.o. the Commission should report  in time forIts recommendations to be considered and legislation carried beforethe 1st January, 1927.  Tho bigger the Commission and the more it^presents interests the longer time it is likely to take over itsfork.Societies, England and Wales   &quot;       Scotland........514
          The merits of the oaae seem&apos;to me decisivelyin favour of the small and impartial Commission and this wouldimplement the pledges givon to the doctors by our predecessors.  But politics enter so largely into thisquestion that I must ask my colleagues definitely to pronounce upon it, as well as on the suggested terms ofreference  to the Commission.
