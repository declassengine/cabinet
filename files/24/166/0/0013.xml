[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                      Printed for the Cabinet.SECRET.CP. 213  (24).                                CABINET.TRANS-JORDAN  AFFAIRS.         MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    THE question of Trans-Jordan was dealt with in paragraph 15 of the ColonialCilice Memorandum on Palestine of the .12th February,  1924, which was circulatedto the Cabinet in  CP- 121 (24).  In the concluding  section of his despatch of the25th January, 1924, on the political and economic condition of Palestine (circulatedto the Cabinet as CP. 136 (24)) Sir Herbert Samuel undertook to furnish a further report on the &quot;present situation and future prospects  in  Trans-Jordan.&quot;   Thisreport has now been received, in the form of two memoranda by Sir Gilbert Clayton,Chief Secretary to the Palestine Administration, with a covering despatch  from theHigh Commissioner.  I circulate the papers for the information of my colleagues.    With regard  to  the  questions  raised in the second of Sir G. Clayton&apos;s two memoranda (dated the 8th. February,  1924), I do not consider that  any immediate action is called for.  King Hussein is  still at Amman in Trans-Jordan, but there is reason to believe that the project of substituting the Emir Ali for the  Emir Abdullahas ruler of the country will not be pursued.  I instructed Sir H. Samuel  in a  telegram dated the 22nd February, 1924 (the terms of which were submitted to the  Cabinetin draft)  that His Majesty&apos;s Government could  not recognise the  right  of  king hussein to depose the ruler of Trans-Jordan or to appoint his successor.                                                                  J.  H.  T.    Colonial Office, March, 21,1924.The Right Hon. J. H. Thomas, P.C., M.P.,    His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.Sir,                                             Jerusalem, February 8, 1924.    I HAVE the honour, in continuation of my secret despatch of the 25th January,1924, to attach two memoranda by Sir Gilbert Clayton on the  subject of Trans-Jordan.    2. I concur in the appreciation of the situation as set forth therein and am inin full agreement with the conclusions arrived at.                                       I have, &amp;c                                            HERBERT SAMUEL,                                                        High Commissioner.J            Memorandum by Sir G. Clayton, dated February 1, 1924.Your Excellency,    I HAVE the honour to submit  a  general  appreciation  of  the  position inTrans-Jordan, together with a brief  sketch of the facts that have led up  to thepresent situation in that country.                                          *    1. When the Turkish forces were finally defeated in Syria an Arab military government, with the Amir Faisul at its head and its Headquarters at Damascus,was set up to administer what was then known as Occupied Enemy Territory East,a territory comprising Trans-Jordan and the districts of Damascus and Aleppo. this administration was  nominally responsible to the Commander-in-chief,  EgyptianExpeditionary Force, who was represented at Damascus and other important centresby British Liaison Officers.      [11406]                                                -        B
    2.  This organisation continued in a slightly modified form after the withdrawalof all  British forces in Syria to Palestine  proper, an event which  occurred inDecember 1919, until the districts of Aleppo and Damascus were occupied by french forces in July 1920 and the Amir Faisul withdrew to Europe.    3.  Trans-Jordan was  thus left virtually without  a  Government and, in August1920, a Civil Administration was organised which took the form of three separateDistricts, namely, the Ajlun, the Balka and Karak; each district being administered by an elected council controlled and advised by a British Officer, who at the sametime represented the High Commissioner.    4.  This system was maintained until the  Amir Abdullah appeared from theHijaz  at Ma&apos;an in November 1920, and subsequently  at Amman in March 1921,with the avowed intention  of attacking the French in Syria.  After some negotiations the Amir was persuaded to forgo his hostile intentions  against the French in Syria,and it was agreed that he should assume for a probationary period of six months the direction of  the Administration in Trans-Jordan  under  the  British Mandate.The Trans-Jordan Government, which enjoyed considerable powers of local autonomy,was then centralised at Amman, and consisted of the  Amir, assisted by a Council ofAdvisers appointed by himself, the District  Councils being abolished.    5. The experiment was carried on for over twelve months, after which the AmirAbdullah approached His Majesty&apos;s Government with a request for recognition,and for a greater measure of independence for Trans-Jordan.  It had been realised that Trans-Jordan  could  not be excluded  from the pledges  given to King Husainin 1916-1917 and that those territories were undoubtedly included within the area in respect of which His Majesty&apos;s Government had  made definite promises to theArabs.   Steps were therefore taken to exclude  Trans-Jordan from those provisions in the Mandate which dealt with the establishment of  a Jewish National Home inPalestine, and the  approval of the  League of Nations to this  amendment of theMandate was obtained on the 16th September, 1922.    6. In the Autumn of 1922 the  Amir,  accompanied by his Chief Adviser, AliBidha Pasha al Bikabi, and by the Chief British Representative, Mr. H. St. J. B.Philby,  C.I.E., proceeded to London, where negotiations were undertaken which resulted in the communication by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the enclosed assurance.to  the Amir Abdullah.    This declaration, although publicly made  known by theHigh Commissioner in a speech delivered at Amman in May  1923, has not yet beenfully implemented,  as the Agreement upon which the recognition of the independence of Trans-Jordan is conditional has not yet been concluded.  It is proposed to resume.negotiations, with  a view to its  completion,  immediately after the departure of king Husain from  Amman.     The recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government of an independent Governmentin  Trans-Jordan  was  also  made conditional  upon  that   Government  being a constitutional one and, with a view to fulfilling that condition, the Amirs Govern- ment promulgated  in December 1923, an Electoral  Law for the constitution of aRepresentative Assembly.  The actual elections have  been delayed by King Husainsvisit,  but  it is  hoped  that the  Assembly will be  in  a  position to  meet  on the1st March, 1924.     7.  Shortly after the establishment of the Amir&apos;s Government it became evidentthat the revenues of Trans-Jordan were insufficient to support the Civil Administration and also the locally recruited Arab force  of 750 men, commanded by a  British Officer,  which wa.s essential not only for the proper  preservation  of security in Trans-Jordan itself, but also for the protection of the eastern boundary of Palestine. His Majesty&apos;s Government, in consideration of the  fact that Palestine&apos;s immunity from  Beduin raids depended  largely upon  the  state of  public  security in Trans-Jordan, obtained  a Parliamentary Grant-in-Aid to the revenues of Trans- Jordan, against which in practice the maintenance of the Reserve Force, now called the  Arab  Legion, and  the  expenses  of  the  Chief  British  Representative^ establishment, were made a  first charge.     8. For the financial year 1921-22 the Grand-in-Aid was fixed at  180,000, but in 1922-23 it was reduced to  100,000, of which  10,000 was subsequently deducted, making a total for the year of  90,000.     During the negotiations carried on with  the Amir Abdullah in London in. the autumn of 1922, it was urged by  the Amir and his  Chief Adviser that an increase in the Grant-in-Aid was  essential if the Government was to be put on a sound basis and enabled to establish a revised system of taxation in such a manner  as to produce increased  revenue.  It was argued that any such measures of reform could only be
undertaken if the country was placed in a satisfactory state of public security, andthat an increase in the Grand-in-Aid was essential in order to augment  the ReserveForce for this purpose   As a result of these negotiations, it was decided that theGrant-in-Aid for 1923-24 should be fixed  at   150,000 on the understanding thatthe  contemplated  measures  of reorganisation would  enable  it to  be reducedsubstantially in the following year.                                      &apos;     9.  It is true that during  the past year the Trans-Jordan Government has not made such progress in the direction of  reorganisation as  was hoped  for, moreespecially  in  the sphere of  finance where,  as has  been  pointed out  in variousdespatches, increased  control appears to be essential.  Moreover, the Amir himselfhas shown that he does not fully realise the necessity for economy, and there is nodoubt that his personal expenditure is on a much more lavish scale than the slenderfinances of Trans-Jordan can support.     Various measures of reorganisation which have been outlined by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are contemplated,  and in the forthcoming financial year it is hoped that considerable improvement may be effected.     10. At the same time, it must be admitted that the policy of a Grant-in-Aid hasfully justified itself, and  that,  in spite of many failings, the Trans-Jordan Govern-meiit, under the control of the Amir, has in  a large measure achieved the main objectfor which  it was established.  From the date of its establishment, which coincideswith the formation of the Reserve Force, now renamed the Arab  Legion, no seriousraids into Palestine from  the country to  the  east of  the Jordan have occurred.Formerly there was constant  danger of incursions by Beduin tribes,  and on one occasion a  raid  of very serious proportions necessitated the employment of con-siderable police and military forces.  This immunity from raids during  the last fewyears has enabled reductions to be made in the military expenditure in connectionWith the Imperial Forces in Palestine, and  reference to the sums allotted during thepast three years will show what substantial economies have been effected.    11. A  reduction  in  the efficiency  of  the  Arab  Legion, which  would  be  an inevitable consequence of the withdrawal of financial aid, would certainly be followedby a return to  conditions wdiich obtained prior to its establishment, and  would reactunfavourably on the security of those districts of Palestine which lie immediately  tothe west of the Jordan.  Moreover, the situation on the Eastern boundaries of Trans-Jordan itself is unsettled and necessitates  the maintenance of  an effective defence force in that territory, not only for its own protection,  but also as a necessary adjunctto the Royal Air Force which is stationed  at Amman, and which operates the air route to Baghdad.    12. It is therefore urged strongly that financial assistance in the ensuing year benot reduced below the sum of  80,000 which Your Excellency has recommended to HisMajesty&apos;s Government as the  Grant-in-Aid for 1924-25. This figure already con-stitutes a reduction of nearly  50  per  cent., which  is  the  utmost which can becontemplated without creating a dangerous situation which might at any  time lead  to serious expenditure.    13. With  regard  to the Amir Abdullah, it may be argued that, in  view of hisextravagant habits and to the calls which are necessarily made upon him as a resultof his prominent position in the Arab world, he is a luxury which Trans-Jordan inits  present impecunious state is  unable  to afford, and that it would therefore be advisable to replace him  by  some less expensive ruler.  There are, however, serious political difficulties in the way of such  a course.  The  case of the Amir Abdullahwould undoubtedly be  taken up vehemently by King Husain, King Faisul and all theArab supporters of the Sherifian family; moreover, the very position which  forceshim  to keep up a position which is perhaps inconsistent with  the resources of thecountry which he governs enables him to exercise an influence over the turbulent tribeseast of the  Jordan which a  ruler of less prestige would be unable to do without agreater expenditure of military force.     14. There is  reason to  hope that,  with  adequate financial control, and an administration imbued with a proper spirit of economy, Trans-Jordan will in timebecome self-supporting  and independent  of any Grant-in-Aid,  but to  withdrawfinancial  aid  prematurely and  too abruptly is  to run the risk of bankruptcy and *consequent anarchy, which must react unfavourably on conditions in Palestine andentail increased expenditure on measures for its defence.

      Text of Assurance conveyed by Bis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government to                       His Highness  the Amir Abdullah.    SUBJECT to the approval of the League of Nations, His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment will recognise the  existence of an  independent Government  in Trans-Jordan  under the rule of His Highness Amir Abdullah ibn Husain, provided suchGovernment is constitutional and places His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in aposition to fulfil their international obligations  in respect of the  territory by meansof an agreement to be concluded between the two Governments.             Memorandum by Sir  G.  Clayton dated February 8, 1924.Your Excellency,     MY memorandum dated the 1st February gave what I considered to be a fairappreciation of the situation in  Trans-Jordan  in  the light of  the information available on the date on which it was written, but since that date I have again visitedAmman, in company with Your Excellency, have had an opportunity of listening tofurther conversations with King Husain, and  have also been able to gain impressionsfrom other sources.     2. It now appears to me that the visit of  King Flusain to Trans-Jordan may cause a considerable change in the situation in regard to  those territories.  The Kinghas apparently been extremely reticent as to the reasons of his visit even to his ownimmediate entourage, but indications are not lacking that one of his main motives isto cement relations between the Hijaz and Trans-Jordan which have already beenbegun by the presence of the Amir  Abdullah  as Head of the Administration atAmman.     I think it not  impossible that, with this end in view, King Flusain has arrangedthe  impending visit of his  eldest  son, the Amir Ali, to Amman with a  view to introducing him unostentatiously as Amir of Trans-Jordan in the place of the AmirAbdullah, whom he could well take with him back to Mecca ostensibly on a visit or to fill the appointment of Commander-in-Chief of the Hijaz Army. I understand that king Husain has made it his business to enquire very closely into the manner in whichthe Administration in  Trans-Jordan has been conducted, both administratively andfinancially,  and  I am informed that he  is  not entirely satisfied  with  the  AmirAbdullah&apos;s conduct of affairs, more especially on the  financial side, where he has undoubtedly been guilty of considerable extravagance.   &apos;  3. The Amir Ali is, I am told, less sophisticated than any of his brothers, havingspent most of his time in the Flijaz, and he is reputed to be a man of simple tastes andaustere habits, who  might conduct the Administration on economical lines.   but probably the most  powerful motive at the back  of the King&apos;s mind is the fact thatthe Amir Ali is his eldest son, who would  in  normal circumstances succeed to the throne of the Hijaz at his father&apos;s death, and, if he were also at  that moment the amir of Trans-Jordan, the incorporation of  Trans-Jordan with the Hijaz would-appear to King Husain a natural sequence of events.     4. These impressions may, of course, be based on false premises, but they coincide with those of British Officers in Amman who are in a position to appreciate the trend of events, notably  Mr. Philby and  Lieutenant-Colonel Peake, and I consider thattheir accuracy  is  sufficiently  probable to  render  it advisable that they  should be conveyed to His  Majesty&apos;s Government.     5. If King HusahYs intentions are in the  direction indicated, they will doubtless be carried out gradually and without any definite announcements or sudden changes,and  the result will be that Flis Majesty&apos;s Government will  be confronted with a fait accomfli, and Trans-Jordan will be connected to the Hijaz by a link which itwill be difficult to  sever.     6. If I am correct in gauging the trend of  King Husain&apos;s policy and he reallyintends to pursue  it, it is not easy to  see how arguments,  other than force, can befound to combat it.   If  airy objection is raised by Flis Majesty&apos;s Government, hewill immediately ask whether, in addition to excluding Palestine  and Syria fromthe pledges given to the Arabs in the early days of the war, His Majesty&apos;s government also intends to  rob  them of  Trans-Jordan,  which has already been admitted asdefinitely included in the promises made in the MacMahon  correspondence.  It maybe  urged that  he could be  informed that in  such circumstances Flis  Majesty&apos;s
 Government could no longer consider the grant  of any  financial assistance  to Trans-Jordan, but this is not a  strong argument in view of the fact that  it has already been proposed by the Colonial Office to the Treasury that the Grant-in-Aid for the next financial year shall  be reduced to very small proportions, the balance beino1 found by the release of Trans-Jordan money which has hitherto been held on deposit for  the payment of arrears of the contribution to the Ottoman Public Debt; moreover, it is not unlikely  that King Husain would  retort that he  is perfectly prepared to do without any Grant-in-Aid from Great Britain, and is willing to make wood any deficit in Trans-Jordan revenues out of his own private purse. &amp;   7. The discussions which took place on the subject  of the Hijaz Railway are also  instructive in the above  connection.   Your Excellency will remember that King Husain stated  that  the  Railway would very  shortly be operating between Madina and Ma&apos;an, and put forward a proposal to the effect that the section between Madina and Nesib, which includes both the  Hijaz and Trans-Jordan sections, should be amalgamated and operated under one direction, the inclusion of the Syrian and Palestine sections of  the line being  left for subsequent arrangement.   He  stated that he was prepared  to admit that the actual management of this section should be entrusted to Colonel Holmes, General Manager of the Palestine Railways, but he spoke of the establishment in Madina of a Moslem Board of Control to direct the policy of the line under whose supervision&apos;would fall  the  Palestine  and  Syrian sections as soon as the unification of the wdiole Hijaz Railway was complete.  King Husain also guaranteed to make good any deficit which might result on the running of the Madina-Nesib section during the next year or twro.     8. King Husain&apos;s proposal  is  similar in  character  to  that  set forth in the Secretary of  State&apos;s  Confidential despatch of  the  18th October,  1923, with the difference that the Secretary of  State&apos;s proposals  amalgamate the Palestine  and Trans-Jordan sections, leaving the inclusion of the Syrian  and Hijaz  sections for future arrangement, whereas King Husain suggests that the Hijaz and Trans-Jordan sections should first be amalgamated under Moslem control and that  the other two should be included later.     9. Another significant fact is that the administration of Ma&apos;an  district up to the line  running  from a point between Anaiza and Juruf al  Darawish  station westward to a ruin called Khirbet es-Samra half-way between Dhana and Shaubah and thence down the Shaubak Valley to the Araba in  the neighbourhood of Khirbet.Feinan, is already, in fact,  controlled by  King Husain, and  the Administrative Officers in that area have been appointed from Mecca (vide your Secret  despatch of the 18th January, 1924, forwarding  the report for December  1923,  by the  Chief British Representative).    10. It appears possible, therefore, that  His  Majesty&apos;s Government may be faced very shortly with  the necessity of deciding finally whether  Trans-Jordan is to be permitted to become  more  and more closely  linked  to the Hijaz or whether this tendency is to be resisted.    11.  If the latter policy is adopted it will be necessary to  take immediate action and explain quite clearly to King Husain  the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter, but it must be remembered that,  such a course may entail a definite break with  King  Husain,  followed  by bitter complaints addressed  to  the  whole Moslem world, against Great Britain, as having finally and completely thrown over her promises to the Arabs.   Moreover, if King Husain  refuses to meet the  wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government it is not easy to  see how the policy of  closer control over  the Administration of  Trans-Jordan can be made effective Avithout the exercise of strong pressure, wrhich may even amount  to force.    12.  On the other  hand,  if the tendency to which  I have referred is merely controlled and not obstructed, it is possible that Hijaz influence may be utilised in a manner favourable to the policy  of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Palestine.   King Husain  has  already  shown  himself  disposed  to refrain  from  intervention  in Palestinian politics, and wrere the Amir Ali to serve a term as Amir in Trans-Jordan, he might be drawn into an attitude of mind towards  Palestine which would  prove useful should he eventually succeed to the throne of the Hijaz.  In this connection, however, must be considered the existence of  the British Mandate over Trans-Jordan, the fact that the Amir Abdullah  was mentioned  personally  in the conditional declaration of the independence of  Trans-Jordan made by His Majesty&apos;s Government. the safety of the Trans-Jordan  Desert Air  Route to Bagdad  and the advantage of promoting  close political and  economic  connection  between  Trans-Jordan&quot; and palestine.
    13! It does not appear impossible that  all these questions might be  suitably-settled and adequate safeguards provided under arrangements which would at thesame time show clearly that Great Britain is prepared to abide by her Declarationsto the Arabs, in so far as concerns Trans-Jordan.   It  is difficult to see how  politicaland  administrative connection  between  Trans-Jordan  and  Palestine  can  be strengthened at present with  due regard &quot;to&quot; the promises  made to the Arabs, butthere  is every reason  to expect that  the pressure  of economic and commercialinfluences are bound to work more and more towards  that connection as time passesand the need of the hinterlahdterfif dries for an outlet  to the sea becomes increasinglyinsistent.                                                            ,                                                   G. F. CLAYTON,                                                             Chief Secretary.
