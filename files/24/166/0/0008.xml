[This Document is the Property  of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.](Printed for the Cabinet.    March 1924.)                                                 50              CABINET.Memorandum by the Secretary  of State for India on the reply of the Government of   India to his proposal for a Conference  in this Country on Indian Political Aims.    The Government of India uncompromisingly  demur  to the  suggestion of HisMajesty&apos;s  Government for endeavouring to arrive  by  conference with  the IndianReform Party at  mutual understanding and co-operation in the development of self-governing institutions in India.    The grounds  of their  demur are  practically  the  same as those  urged by theSecretary  of  State&apos;s Council, namely,  that  Indian politicians generally  speakingwill  either accept the proposals  as offering expectation of a fresh  advance in thenear future towards responsible  self-government,  which  they consider would  be dangerous, because if  prompt advance  did not result  intense bitterness would  bearoused and bad  faith imputed, or, if such expectations are directly barred by theterms of announcement, then politicians will view the proposal with suspicion anddistrust as being dilatory tactics having no practical  purpose, that the proposal wouldbe rejected  by extreme politicians and they would refuse to  make any statementbefore  proposed Committee.    I  do  not  consider this objection to be conclusive, nor am  I overwhelminglyimpressed by some of subsidiary objections  submitted by the Viceroy to the proposal,for example,  those  embodied  in para. 6.  We are not  so much  concerned  withspeculations as to the greater  or less perversity of Indian politicians, with regardto which opinions range with much plausibility from those expressed by Macaulay inhis essay  on Warren Hastings  to those expressed by  Mr. C.  F. Andrews in the manchester Gua?&apos;dian with  regard to Mr.  Gandhi, as with the  question what is reasonable and right for  His Majesty&apos;s Government, acting without  prejudice,  toattempt to do,  leaving those who may be responsible for unjustifiable consequences tobe responsible for them.    On taking up this office, I found that (the Indian Government were confronted with an explicit demand,  on the part of a party constitutionally elected in considerableforce, for the immediate grant of full responsible government to India.    I  judged  that  to accede to, or to promise to accede to, that peremptory demand would  be  an act  of  insane levity, and the  more I  study the speeches, writings andpersonalities of the persons who make that demand, and to whom it would presumablyfall to  administer such a  constitution,  the  more I  find myself  established  in  thatjudgment.  Even if this  judgment were not accepted by His Majesty&apos;s government it would be impossible to obtain the  consent  of Parliament  to the adoption of thecourse  demanded.    I consider it on these grounds impossible to give encouragement  to any expectation that such immediate course will be taken.    Alternatively, it was being  suggested  that  consideration might be given to theearly sending out of  a Commission to  make the enquiry and report provided to bemade under the Act not later than 1929.    To clo this would be tantamount to  admitting that the grant of full responsibleself-government, or at least the alteration of the constitution  and the supersession ofthe Montagu-Chelmsford scheme,  had  become  a  question of  immediate  practical politics, an admission which I have no sufficient material to sustain.    The Viceroy&apos;s telegram suggests  a slight  remonstrance on  the theme that when,&quot; with  the object of attempting to obtain the co-operation of Moderates  and Indepen-dents,&quot; his Government desired to formulate in the Assembly their methods for dealingwith agitation for constitutional advance, we did not accept their  recommendations.The only limitation which in fact we placed upon them was that they should not saythat  if, in the course of the  examination  which we approved, they arrived at theconclusion that the statutory Commission  should then be appointed, they would beprepared  to make  this recommendation,  notwithstanding that the full  period  of     720.1    80 3.24IISECRET.CP. 203(24).......1.......I...................IliniHlll............... 11  &quot;                    ........;
 10 years had not elapsed.  To have made such a promise for the sake of placating the Moderates would have effectively prejudiced the situation, and would have been  open to precisely those objections which  are advanced against our proposal, whilst it would certainly have encouraged the  Swarajists to nail  their colours to  the mast  on the policy of making the present constitution unworkable.  The action we propose might indeed lead to the same result, viz., the recommendation to appoint  the Commission, but it stands in front of it and does not immediately raise the expectation of its being adopted.      Whatever course was to be taken it had, and  has, to  proceed in an  orderly manner as a natural development from the principal facts of the existing situation.      These principal facts are :       (1) That,  we. have a transitional constitution in  which there may be practical defects.  We cannot take the word of the Swarajists  for this because they have not tried to work this constitution.  But those who have been working it have, I believe,. a good deal  to  say, and we can  take  arguments and proofs  from  the Swarajists also.   On  the whole we  have  had  fairly complacent reports as  to its  opera- tion,  and Mr.  Sastri last July  spoke very  fair  words  about it to the Empire Parliamentary Association.   The  substantial criticisms of  it  had not been  very prominently disclosed.   From a  reading of the debates in the Assembly  and in local Councils, some of them, as seen by the Swarajists,  who entirely  repudiate the reforms, began to transpire.  Our first request to the  Government of India, therefore, was to investigate any defects that could be remedied in the  working of the  reform scheme, which policy we enlarged after correspondence  with the Viceroy  to  aim at the formulation of the improvements by rules under the Act, or  even by  amend- raents of the Act not extending  to a change in the constitution.   We practically gave him  all the liberty he desired in this direction except in regard to  holding out the expectation of an early Commission, or of pledging ourselves to agree to any  amend- ments of the  Act that might be recommended such  amendments, of course, being matters we should have to submit to.Parliament.      (2) The second leading fact was the announced programme of the Swaraj Party and  the premise of entire distrust, which I have frequently quoted,  on&apos; which  that programme rested.     (3) The third fact  was that  there was an  apparent disposition on the  part of the Swaraj Party  to  place  more- confidence  in  the intentions  of the present Government than  in  those of  the  last, and  that  we  received unofficially  some indications that an  attitude of confidence  and friendliness  on  our part would be appreciated and would facilitate matters  The Government of India obviously attach no importance whatever  to such manifestations.  I do not feel myself able to adopt that  attitude or,  to impute bad faith and unreason when no bad faith  or  unreason is- apparent.     Remembering the continuous  attitude of the Government of India towards the whole  of,the Indian movement  towards self-government from its  inception  to this day,  and knowing what 1 and other members of His Majesty&apos;s Government, do of the personalities of  a good  many of the Indian politicians, I am  strongly disposed  to think that His Majesty&apos;s  Government may safely trust themselves a little further in the direction  of assuming good faith  and intelligence on the  part  of the  present representatives of this movement than  the Government of India is prepared to advise them to do.      I am not convinced that it is impossible to make any effect on the attitude of Swaraj politicians in regard to  their belief in the good faith of His Majesty&apos;s Government, or, on the other hand, that they  are entirely unable  to give any valid justification for some elements in that mistrust.      I. find it increasingly difficult to maintain a serene conviction that the Government of India and their servants have now arrived at full  and perfect wisdom  with regard to their attitude  and  demeanour towards  Indian  Swaraj  aspirations  and  their representatives.      The line which  the Cabinet Committee  have  advocated is  based upon  the foregoing considerations and their like.   If and when the enquiry by the Government of India into unsatisfactory features and possible amendments of the Act has  yielded as full results as possible ; if and when an endeavour to  clear away misunderstandings and  suspicions has yielded  its  full possible results,  then, and I consider then  only, will His Majesty&apos;s Government be in a  position to make a fair  judgment of  the
situation ; that is to say, whether the existing Act does afford a good working basis for a transition and whether the Swarajists, in refusing to work that Act, are invinciblyand  perversely factious, and. must be fought for there is no  other alternative.  Noshadow of  an alternative is  suggested by  the  Government of  India,  or has beensuggested to me by my Council.    Nor, I  think, until such  an enquiry, on both sides of it, has been conducted, in whatever way it may be possible to effect it, should we be  justified in entertaining aproposal that a Royal Commission should be sent out to do what was contemplated toba done in 1929.    I attach copies of two  interim telegrams I have addressed to the  Viceroy to clear up the situation.    March  1924.                                     .             OLIVIER.              From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 22nd March 1924.    943.  Private.  Your private  telegram  of  the  21st March,  marked  secret.   Ihave so far only received first  two parts, but think it best to send you immediateinterim reply.    Distinction which His Majesty&apos;s Government have in mind is between (a) minorchanges in the constitution which can be effected either in rules or in the Act itself;(b) major changes which can similarly be effected.   Their view  is  that distinctionbetween minor and major changes cannot be made to correspond with any distinctionbetween  changes in  the. rules alone and  changes  in  the  Act  respectively.   Asregards minor changes, please refer, for example, to my  telegram  of the 18th march to Legislative Department suggesting that changes in section 80 (a) might be suitablesubject of enquiry by  Government  of India Committee.   Distinction,  therefore, is notlegal, but constitutional, and lies between improvements of present structure, whetherexpressed in rules or in the Act itself,  and alterations of that structure.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,  basing themselves on Hailey&apos;s speech, have  approved former course, butdo not as at present  advised contemplate latter.   This- was  intention  both  of my statement in  the House of Lords  and of my  telegram  of  12th March,  and  yourinterpretation stated at end of your para. 3 is therefore correct.               From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 24th March 1924.    964.  Private.  Secret.  Your private secret telegram of 2.1st March.   Para. 4.  The-enquiry you have announced, and which I am giad to understand you intend to proceedwith forthwith, would, according to our intention, completely and exclusively, so far as itmay go, fulfil the purpose of  the second branch into which enquiry is  contemplated,and it was assumed that this  would be the first contribution  towards  that purpose.But it would be an essential part of the intention of any such course of action  as that proposed that a full  and  definite  statement  should  be invited  from Swaraj partyrepresentatives and dissatisfied Liberals as  to  any complaints they might have tomake  of dyarchy scheme, whether or  no these were earned  by your  enquiry.  in central Provinces want of confidence debate most Swarajists speakers asserted withoutparticulars unworkability of  reform scheme.  This  is different ground from  that oftheir  manifesto.   Golwalkar   went  further  on same ground,  and made definitecriticisms of its defects.  It might, therefore,  I think, be  assumed  that representativedelegates might have  something to say on these points  as well as in explanation oftheir distrust of the intention of the reforms.  Full reply will be sent to your telegramafter consultation.
