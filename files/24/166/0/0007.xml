9*7KMHMBHI  IS MB PROPS 3TY Off KI3, BRITANNIC MAJESTTS GgTOMT).     The question of the representation of Ireland in theHouse of lords by Irish Representative PeerB should beconsidered by the Cabinet, although possibly no immediate action is necessary.     When the Irish Free State was constituted the provisions in the Act of Union, 39 &amp; 40 Greo.HI., ch.67 whioh entitleIrish Peers to elect from their own number 28 BepresentativePeers to represent Ireland as a whole in the House of Lordswere not altered, and there are at present 28 such Peerssitting in the House, the number of Irish Peers not entitledto sit in the House being now 53.     This position is clearly anomalous, inasmuch as, now theIrish Free State has been constituted, the North of Irelandalone has any claim or reason for representation in the House of Lords.  The present representation is therefore Indefensible both in respect of quantity and in respect of quality, - in respect of quantity as it is obvious that the representation of the North of Ireland should be much less in number than the representation of the whole of Ireland;   and in respect of quality, because the representation of the North of Ireland&apos; should be confined to Peers having an interest in the North of Ireland, elected not by all the Irish Peers but only by the Irish Peers having such an interest.      Logically, therefore, the law should be so altered as to bring about the reduction of the number of Irish Hepresen- tative Peers and a proper limitation of  the number andfffljg ACUMEN SECRET. fi.P.207(24)..CABINET,iaiSH BEffaSSSHTATrVE PEE3B.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor,: qualification and mode of election of those Peers,
     Irish Hepr-eaeatative Peers are elected for life,and the question need not uec^seajrfJy be decided until a vacancy arises, but of course this might occur atany moment.     The first question is whether action should be postponed till a vacancy arises; the second, what formaction should take when the time for talcing action doescome.     As to the first question, it would seem natural toalloxv this question, which has up till now boen allowed           to lie dormantto lie aormant,/E?or a little time longer.  It is probablysafe to say that no one really wants to deal with &quot;ohequestion or to straighten out the present anom&amp;lo-M,position.  On the other hand, the time must come coon whenthe question will have to be faced, and it would be easier to deal with it  as an abstract question than as a questionarising on a concrete case.     There seem  to be four possible courses open to theGovernment -      (i)  To do nothing,  in which case any vacancy          that may occur will necessarily  remain unfilled          from mere lack  of machinery.     (ii)  To take such action as may be required to          enable  vacancies to be filled as they occur.    fiii)  To onact that there should be no further          election of  Irish Representative Peers; and     (iv)  To bring about  the alterations of  the law          which  are  logically required to make the          representation  of Irish Peero in the House          of Lords appropriate  to the present position          ef affairs  in Ireland.      The  first  course will inevitably involve a storm of criticism on the occurrence  of  the next vacanoy.  The answer for what it  is worth would presumably be that under the changed  conditions Ireland is  clearly over represented in the House  of Lords  and that  no harm can  be done by
allowing vacancies to accumulate until it is seen whether any opportunity occurs of putting the matter on a properfooting in connection with some comprehensive measuredealing with the constitution of the Upper House.     The second course seems even more difficult as itis clear that any further election of Irish RepresentativePeors would he open to strong criticism in the Free State.If it were possible to carry out such an election&apos;withoutdeliberately setting up new machinery for the purpose theopposition might not become active, but as indicated abovethe necessary machinery no longer exists for although thereis a direct statutory obligation on the death of an IrishItepresentative Peer to elect another, the procedure, whichis also statutory, has been rendered entirely ineffectualby the constitution of the Irish Pree State, two essentiallinks, the Irish Lord Chancellor and the Irish Clerk ofthe Crown having ceased to exist.  She adaptations thatwould be required are fairly obvious but to effect them would require a special Act of Parliament, unless indeed it were held that the purpose could be effected by anOrder in Council under Section 6(1)fa) of the IrishFree State  (Consequential Provisions) Act, 19H2,  (Sessional.     The third course is possibly the easiest, as a Billmerely providing that no further election of IriuhRepresentative Peers was to be held would probably not -excite much opposition.  On the other hand, such a coursedoes nothing to remedy the anomaly of the position.     The fourth course would be strictly logical.  On theother hand, the Bill would not be an easy one to pass* andthe  question would be further complicated by the neoessityof making due provision for the possibility of the unionof northern  Ireland with the Pree State.
     I have thought it advisable to bring these matters to the notice of the Cabinet in order that they shbuldnot be taken by surprise in case en Irish Peer diesand the vaoancy so created brings a question up forimmediate decision.     The view which I would rsoommend to my colleaguesis that we should for the present do nothing.                         (Intd.) E. of 0.ijferoh 84th,. 1984.
