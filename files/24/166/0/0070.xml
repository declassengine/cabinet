[This Document  is the Property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.]                     [Printed for the Cabinet,   April 1924.)SECRET.CP. 270 (24).               Proposed Protective Duties on Steel imported into India.    Ia continuation of CP. 256(24), I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinetthe following draft of a telegram for despatch to the  Government of India withreference to their Steel Tariff proposals.  The draft represents in the main the viewsof the Cabinet Committee  on Indian Affairs, but has been  further revised  by myself.after communication with the Viceroy, with a view to avoiding certain  constitutionaldilliculties indicated by the latter.  26th April 1924.                                                   OLIVIER.    Draft Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Department of Commerce,                              dated    April 1924.    Your telegram dated 28th March.   Steel.  You will realise  that His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment does not hold the view that  a  policy of fiscal protection  is  that best calculated to  promote the economic and industrial interests of any country.   But HisMajesty&apos;s  Government has no intention of departing from the spirit of the fiscal autonomy Convention, which has  been built up by pronouncements of successive governments since 1919 ;  and it accepts the position that (except possibly on  specificgrounds irrelevant to the present question)  it will  not  disallow  any  tariff measure which the Government of India, after prior official consultation with the Secretary ofState, recommends to the legislature and which the legislature accepts.  Moreover, Ishould add  that  any measures  of   preference  in favour  of  British goods   in  theDominions have  hitherto always come in the form of entirely spontaneous offersfrom  such Dominions ;  and  His Majesty&apos;s  Government attach  importance  to this principle being adhered to with regard to India.    2. Bis Majesty&apos;s Government regard it as essential that before any preferentialtariff  or  bounty  is  embodied in the Indian  budget there should be passed in  theAssembly a free and undirected resolution pronouncing in favour of such a policy.    3. As I have not had before me the materials for checking  detailed figures of cost on production, price  of imported  goods,  &amp;c, on  which they have based theircalculations of duties and bounties appropriate to various classes of goods, I cannotexpress definite opinion on these, but must leave it to your Government to  scrutinisethese figures carefully arid modify the duties  or bounties in  any cases in which you cannot accept figures on which they  are based.    4. In para 4. of your telegram you remark that  procedure adopted  by tariff board has  involved writing  clown capital  of Tata  Iron  and  Steel  Company  for purpose  of  arriving at reasonable  cost of producing steel  in India.  I agree with you that as value of works is less than capital  expenditure  account  writing  down isnecessary.  But  further,  since  nominal capital  account  as exhibited  in  para.  78exceeds 15 crores adopted for estimating return on investment, it  would appear that,apart from unforeseen developments, holders  of ordinary and deferred shares will  not receive normal dividends if nominal capitalisation is  left as at present.   This willprovide a lever for Company in future years  to press for protection to be maintained at a rate  sufficient  to  produce normal  dividends  on the admittedly inflated  capital.I think it very desirable therefore to bring all possible pressure  to bear on Tata&apos;s to promise  early reconstruction on basis of lower  capital  value.   This would have further advantage of securing admission by Tata&apos;s that Tariff Board&apos;s calculations arecorrect in substance and that they are in fact  over capitalised.   It might be put toTata&apos;s that whole object of scheme  which  is to develop  steel industry will be greatlyfurthered by such reconstruction as this,  which will help them to raise new capitalwhen needed in future.                                          &apos;j      7300   125  4.24
     5. Proposal of Tariff Board that your Government should take power  to imposeoffsetting duties is, as you.recognise, open to serious constitutional objection.   You willhave recognised from what I have said  above that His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldnot  desire  that you  should incur  any embarrassment  whatever for the sake ofestablishing principle of Imperial preference if there is not  the voluntary dispositionin your Government to grant it.  I cannot conceal my strong doubt  of prospects ofsuccess of the methods by which  you suggest that this  object might in effect be attained.     6. If you find  it necessary in  last resort  to accept proposal to take this  power,I shall be prepared to acquiesce, but it is in my  opinion clear that absolutely unfetteredpower over tariff  rates should not pass to Executive Government and permissibleincrease should, I think, be limited to 25 per cent, of rate imposed by Legislature.     7. I note your  assurance that  this power would  be exercised only in  case of necessity when you  are  satisfied of  reality and  urgency of  need, that save in most exceptional cases it  would only be  exercised  after public and careful investigationusually by Tariff Board,  and,  finally,  that wherever feasible  you  would  consultLegislature before taking action.   I attach utmost importance to these points.  I alsothink that  in  legislation  contemplated  your Government  should .take  power torequire manufacturers to give relevant information regarding their business and toproduce books if called for.     8. I accept proposals in para. 12 of your telegram regarding three-year period.     9. I agree with you in wishing to have report published before end of month.   10. I await views of Railway Board, promised  in  para. 3 of  your telegram onTariff Board&apos;s estimate of cost of higher duties  on railways.
