DRAFT OF  A BILL                 To  explain subsection (2)  of  section one  of the                  Goal Mines  Regulation  Act,  1908,  as amended by                  any subsequent  enactment6            Be  it enacted &amp;c.splanation      1.   For removing doubts  it  is  hereby declared thatif&quot; 8 Edw.7.,57,Sol(2).  for the  purposes of subsection  (2) of section  one of the            Coal Mines Regulation  Act, 1908, a workman shall not be            deemed to  be a workman working  in  a shift unless he is            lowered  within the time fixed in accordance with that Act            for the  lowering of that shift  and is raised to the surface            within the time so fixed for  the raising of that shift. ort title.      2,  (1)  This Act may be  cited  as the Coal  Mines Act,            1924, and  the Coal Mines Acts 1837 to 1919 and this Act            may be cited together  as the  Coal  Mines  Acts,  1887 to 1924.                   (2)  This Act shall not  apply to  Northern Ireland.
           DRAFT, EXPLAIN AT CRY MEM OR AN DIM,     The object  of this Bill is to remove doirhts aboutthe maximum period during which, in certain circumstances,a workman is permitted by the Coal Mines Regulation Act,1908 (as amended by the Coal Mines Act,, 1919) to be belowgr ound 0     Subsection  (1) of the first section of the PrincipalAct specifies the maximum period (now seven hours ) duringwhich a workman may be -underground in a coal mine,   but where workmen arc working&apos;in a shift, this limitation ( bysubsection 2) is not to be applied to every individual workman:.here the shift, not the individual, is to  be the unit, andit is declared that no contravention of the statutory maximumis to be deemed to take place in the case of a workman working in a shift, if the perlcd between the times at which the lastworkman in the shift leaves the surface, and the^ first workmanin the shift retmnistor the surface does not exceed seven hours.It is also enacted (subsections 3 and 4 ) that for every shiftthe times at whioh the lowering and raising of the workmen areto be begun and ended are to be fixed by the management,approved by the inspector,  and posted at the pithead.     The legislature clearly contemplated that the loweringand raising of the &quot;Shift would be continuous processes, begunand completed at the times  fixed, and did not intend by the&apos;provision quoted to permit  any workmen to be below groundlonger, at the most, than seven hours plus the periods fixedand approved for the raising and lowering of the shift.Judicial doubt has however  been expressed whether the wordsitalicised give effect to this intention:  the view has foundsupport, that, by their literal construction,  if one workmanin the shift returns to the surface within seven hours of the
descent of the last workman in the shift there can be nocontravention of the Act in respect of the rest of themen in the shift, however long they remain below grounds     This Bill makes clear the intention of the legislatureby declaring that no workman is to be deemed to be a&quot;workman working in a shift&quot; unless he is lowered andraised within tho times fixed and approvedo   And if he isnot a &quot;workman working in a shift&quot;, it follows that themaximum period during which he may be underground is (subjectto the provisions of the Acts) seven hours only.
