(THIS. DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOTORHMSITT)     1.   The House  of Commons Debate  on  this Bill malces  aCabinet decision imperative.   As  the  Act which the Billproposes to renew  expires  on May 31st,  the matter  is  immediatelyurgent,     2.   It is now  quite  certain  that in the Scottish GrandCommittee a motion will be made to  substitute &apos;31st March,1925&quot; for &apos;31st March, 1926&apos; as the date  on which  the existingarrangement is to  terminate.   It  is no less certain  that,  ifa division is taken,  the motion will be carried by an over-whelming majority,,    In the present state of parties  therewould be no hope of  restoring the Bill to its original  formon Report.     3.   If the situation is to be saved, it is essentialthat I should be in  a position at the  Committee  stage (a) tooffer &apos;31st July&apos;, 1925&apos;  as a compromise, and (b)  to  make adefinite statement as to the Government&apos;s real  intentions.Are they going to adhere to the contributory principle, or arethey going to abandon it altogether?     4.   A cardinal point to remember is that  a decision forScotland means a decision for England  also.    If the  con-tributory principle  disappears in the  one country,  it mustdisappear in the other - unless,  indeed (which  is unthinkable)the English teachers are willing to revert to the 1912-18position,  when they  enjoyed no superannuation privileges worthspeaking of.   On the other hand,  if the  contributory principle is to remain,  the schemes for the two  countries  must,  so. far asthe teachers are concerned, be  identical.

                                                           0 Q                                                         i 0 0perfectly  plain  in  the Debate  that  the  House  will   not  toleratea perpetuation of. the present  anomalies,  which give rise to serious hardships and are  a  hindrance to  free interchange.      5.    If  the date of the Scottish Bill  becomes  &apos;31st March,1925&apos;, this will mean the  disappearance of  the contributorysystem.    The measure for  England must&apos;come first,  and  this could not  possibly be carried  in the early  weeks of next SessionEqually the Government could not possibly come before parliament with a third Bill of a temporising  character.     6.    So  complete a reversal of policy  would be honestlyregretted  by  the general body  of Scottish teachers  and  of scottish Members, even by  those who are pressing for theearlier date.   If it were brought  about, as  it would be, not by a deliberate decision of  the Cabinet,  but  simply by  a processof drifting,  Government prestige would  suffer seriously.     7.    On  the other hand, ths compromise of &apos;31st July,1925&apos;,while giving  a date more convenient to  teachers and Managersfor a change  of system,  would make  little or  no difference  to parliamentary time..   Any Bill which was  to become  operativeon 1st April, 1926 - the date in the draft Bill - would requireto be carried in the Session 1924-25.    But practically thewhole of that Session would be available  for  a measure whichwas not to  become law until 1st August, 1925,     8.    I verfture to add a word on the main  question.    InScotland all parties concerned - Education Authorities as wellas teachers - are in favour  of legislation  on  the lines of theDepartmental Committee&apos;s Report.     The Board  of Educationforesee difficulties in England and Wales (l)  from  teachers and (2) from local authorities.   As to  these:-           (l)  Ho criticism has ever been made against  the     general fairness of the Committee&apos;s proposals  so far as     the  teachers are concerned.    Short of  entirely relieving     them of contributions, nothing could  be more generous.     Once they realise  that the principle  of contribution has                                                      come/
         come to stay, their opposition will cease.   So long        as they believe that there is a chance of getting rid of        it,  they will continue to play for time,             (2) The 2\ per cent contribution which the Committee        suggest that local authorities should pay is not an        insuperable obstacle.   If opposition in the House proves        too formidable,  it ean be met in one or other of two Ways.        Either (i)  tho Exchequer might take over the obligation of        the local authorities and blocks Itself responsible for        5 per cent.,  the other 5 per cent., being met,  as the        Committee propose,  by the teachers;  or (ii) the objections        of the local  authorities might be overcome by an adjust-        ment of their grant.    I would deprecate the first        alternative very strongly.   It would be directly contrary        to the recommendation of the Departmental Committee and        would greatly reduce the advantages that would be derived        from a funding scheme.    The second alternative would not        affect any  of the main principles which the Departmental        Committee have laid down.   In either event there would        be no difficulty in securing contributions from local        authorities in Scotland.              To sum up,  I ask for authority to act as follows    when the Bill comes before the Scottish Grand Committee -    (a) to offer as a compromise the date &apos;31st July,  1925&apos;  and    (b) to announce that the Government mean to adhere to the    principle of contribution and that early next Session they    will introduce  a Bill embodying a scheme which,  so far as the.    teachers are concerned,  will be based generally on the lines    of the Emmott Comittee 1 s Report.        .9.   Copies of this memorandum have been forwarded to the    Chancellor of the Exchequer,  and the President of the Board    of Education.   The latter has intimated that he is  circulating    a separate memorandum,                                          WSL.  ADAMS OK.ottish Office,  Whitehall.12th May,  1924,
