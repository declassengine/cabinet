UNEMPLOYMENT.2.  Arising out of the discussion recorded Inthe previous Conclusion on the Third Interim Report ofthe Cabinet Committee, the Cabinet had a short discus-eion of a general character in regard to Unemployment,,They were informed that the attempts to relieve unemployment by applications to the Local Authoritiesto undertake large schemes which would have this effectwere tending to prove sterile, since the Local Authori-tios in many case3 were coming to the end of their resources.   The most important outstanding question at the present time was in regard to the Severn Barraga.The Terms of Reference to an Expert Committee on thissubject were under consideration and would in due coursecome before the Cabinet Committee.     The Cabinet&quot;were Informed that, apart fromHousing, the most hopeful line of advance in findingemployment was by inducing the Railway Companies tocontinue the process of electrifying suitable portions of the railways.     The Cabinet agreed :-       (a)  That the Committee on Unemployment and            Housing should continue to explore all      *     possible means of finding employment,            more particularly in connection with            the Minister of Eeolth&apos;s Housing Scheme,            which might employ considerable numbers            of unskilled men In such work as the cOr.-            struction of roads and sewers, and in            connection with the electrification of            railways:       (b)  That the President of the Board of Trade,            as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on            Unemoloyment and Housing, should discuss            with the Minister of Transport the best            method of inducing the railways to            expedite the process of electrification,            with a view, if necessary  and desirable,            to the Prime Minister seeing the Chairmen            of the principal Railway Groups on the            subject.
