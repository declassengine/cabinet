Report  of Cabinet Committee.1.   A Committee composed  of the Lord Privy Seal, theChancellor  of the Exchequer, the President of the Boardof Education and the Secretary for Scotland have examined the memoranda recently circulated to the Cabinet by theSecretary for Scotland (CP. 292(24)) and the Presidentof the Bijard of Education  (Cl. 295(24)) on the questionof the action to be taken  by the Government regarding theEducation (ScotlandJ(Superannuation) Bill 1924.2.   It will be remembered that after careful review ofthe political and educational considerations urged inMemoranda by the President of the Board of Education(CLP, 92(24), CP. 126(24), CP.  158(24)) and by the Seore-tary for Scotland (CP. 116(24)),  the Cabinet (Cabinet 19(24)15))adopted the Recommendations of the Home Affairs Committee tothe effect that the Education Superannuation Acts of 19&amp;should be extended by separate Bills for England and Vfeles andfor Scotland respectively and that the date of expiration ofthe two Bills should be identical,  namely 1st April 1926.With regard to this date it may be recalled that the Presidentof the Board of Education had originally proposed 1st Augtist1926 and the Secretary for Scotland 1st august 1925 and that1st April 1926 was ultirately adopted as a compromise by all ministers concerned after it had  been ascertained that thedate was acceptable to the National Union of Teachers.
3.     The English (Superannuation) Bill has now passed through all its stages in the House of Commons and theCommittee agree with the view of the President of theBoard of Education that, even if practicable, it wouldbe most undesirable from every point of view to attemptto alter the agreed date in Clause 1(1) of this Billo4.     With regard to the Scottish Bill the Committee areInformed that the Government will certainly be defeatedin the Scottish Grand Committee unless a date substantiallyearlier than 31st March 1926 is inserted in the Bill andthat the Secretary for Scotland will be pressed by membersof all parties to indicate the nature of the Governmentspermanent policy and particularly whether that policy isbased on a contributory or a non-contributory system.Indeed it wcaild appear that the real object of those whofavour the insertion of an earlier date in the Bill is tosecure an  immediate announcement that the Government havedecided in favour of a scheme on a contributory basis.in these circumstances the Secretary fcr Scotland pressedhis suggestion that he should be authorised -     (a) to offer as a compromise the date &apos;31st July 1925&apos;     and (b) to anmrace that the Government mean to adhere     to the principle of contribution and that early next     Session they will introduce a Bill embodying a scheme    which, so far as the teachers are concerned, will be     based generally on the lines of the Emmott Committees     Repart a5,     The President of the Board of Education, while willingIn the special circumstances to accept the proposed altera-tion of date in the Scottish Bill, stated that, for thereasons fully set out in his various Memoranda, he&apos; was entirely opposed to any statement being made at the present
 time as to the  Government&apos;s  future  polioy.  A  statement on the lines  proposed  by the Secretary  for  Scotland  would mean a reversal of  the recent decision  of the  Cabinet  in the matter and  of the  attitude  hitherto  taken  up by  the Board of Education  in  connection with the forthcoming  salary negotiations  between the Local  Education Authorities and the Teachers.   The  effect  on those  negotiations of the-suggested  announcement would be dangerous in the extreme,. Mr.  Trevelyan added that he  confidently hoped  by the spring of 1925 to bo in a  position  to  formulate proposals for a permanent  superannuation scheme. 6.    General  agreement was expressed with the  view that in the event  of  an announcement of the Government!s polioy having to  be  made care should be taken to guard against any suggestion that the Government  were in any way opposed to the contributory principle.      The Committee  agreed&apos;:-      (l)   To  recommend  the Cabinet  that the Secretary           for Scotland  should if necessary be  authorised           to  offer  as  a compromise  to substitute the           date  &apos;31st July 1925&apos; for the date &apos;31st March           1926&apos;  in  the Education (Scotland)(Superannuation)           Bill  1924.      ( )   To  reserve for the decision of the Cabinet the           question  whether the Secretary for Scotland           should be authorised to make any statement as           to  tho future policy  of the Government and if           so  what the  precise nature of that statement           should be signed on behalf of the  CommitteeifJ.R.  CLYHESR.B. Howorth,   Secretary.Chairman.11 Downing Street,  S.W.1.14th May,  1924.
