3QB3T..,         Report &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the                          Secretary for Scotland.:P.300 (24).        &apos;             _____             (1)&quot;  At their meeting on the let May tho Cahinet  considered        memoranda respecting a scheme proposed &quot;by the Secretary for        Scotland for assisting herring fishermen in Scotland tc purchase        nets on the general basis of 50$ of the cost hearing interest        at 5%,   The- total sum proposed to be advanced was  150,000.        The conclusion reached was as follows:-          (a)  Subject to no Supplementary Estimate being required.          to approve&quot;-in principle that assistance should he given to          the herring fishermen in Scotland.          (h)  That the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary          for Scotland should examine and report.&quot; at the next meeting          of the Cahinet as to the best method cf giving help without          the necessity of a Supplementary Estimate, whether by means          of a guarantee,  by the use -pf the Pevelopment Fund,  the          Trade Facilities Act,  the formation of Co-operative Societies,          the use of the Local 3o^t Clubs&quot; for the purchase of the net6.,          or otherwise.             (?.)  We examined the foregoing suggested methods of giving        help without the necessity of a Supplementary Estimate, and we&apos;        agreed in the  conclusion that the only one.which might meet the        case wa.s the use of&apos; the  Development Fund.             (3)  Accordingly an application by the Fishery Beard for        Scotland for an *advance  from the  Development Fund to enable them        to institute such a scheme of loans has been submitted to the        Development Commiseiohfirsi    In it  the Fishery Board stated that        their statistics ahow that the  nets in use had fellers from        $13,000 in 1920 to 222,CCC  in 1533,  a decrease of 91,000.                  The  Cotraaicaioners heve  KO&quot; inti-mated,  after  a meeting        with the Chairmen  of the&apos;Piehery  Bo-?,rd.  that,  apart  from  doubts        which they entertain as  to  the  proposal  being fresh frcm other        l.ega&apos;1 objection,&quot; they  dc not  consider  that  such  an advance  from        the  Development Fund would  he aa  imprcveraent cr  development  of        fisheries  within their view of  the  spirit  and  intentions  of  the                                                               Act/     /
     (5). -It thus appears that all the methods specified in theCabinet conclusion are unavailable.   We are unable to suggest any other method except a Supplementary Estimate.     (o)  It appears, therefore, that the only alternatives are -     (i) to w^ive the stipulation that there is to be no Supple-.mentsry Estimate and to give sffect, by tii*t method, to theproposal for assisting the fishermen which the Cabinet have approved in principle.   Owing to the time that has elapsed andthe limited output, of the net manufacturers the expenditure in thecurrent financial year would probably not reach the full -amount of 150,000:     (ii) to adhere to the stipulation that there is to be noSupplementary Estimate end to announce that the Government havedecided. t&quot;T*.t no assistance c*n be given.          An e*rly decision by t.ie Cabinet is of&apos; -importance inview of. the approach of the herrinp fishine; season and therepeated demands in-Parliament: for ah-announcement.Scottish Office,.    Whitehall..                 /.14th Kay-; -1934.Act,   They therefore regret that they are unable to recommendan advance from the Development !Fund for the purpose.     (4)  In intimating their decision to the Treasury,  theCommissioners spy that they are impressed by the case put forward for some measure of public assistance to meet the present emer-gency, and they are disposed to accept the Fishery board&apos;s viewthat similar demands, for State help are unlikely to be cf are current, character.   They add that they are so much impressed by the value to the community of the services of the herringfishermen that they wish to express a strong hope that theTreasury Till find seme method of assisting them to obtain thegear.which they require, whether by means of a guarantee or aloteni
