FOR HIS PURCHASE OF IB OB.Memorandum by the Chancellor of  tho  Exchequer,-     1.   I am strongly opposed-to the proposals of  theSecretary for Scotland for advancing money from the exchequer to enable herring fisherman in Scotland to purchase no ts(CP. 250 (24)).     2J   I would remind the Cabinet that &quot;the industry hasalready received generous assistance from -public funds,  since in 1919 and 1920 the Government agreed - to schemes of guaranteeand purche.se which helped tho herring fishermen at a net costto the Government for Great Britain of about  l.,70O50OG -though the conditions of.-foreign markets (and to some extent.the recipients of the benefit), were then different0   At theend of 1920 tho Government intimated that financial ass is t-anco must cease and the herring industry must stand on itsown legs.     3,   It will presurmbly be common ground that the              v &apos;recurrent grant of assistance to the industry in ordinaryconditions would be indefensible and that a loan scheme couldonly bo justified if it wore demonstrated that an exeptional and E on --re current emergency existed at present which could betided over with Government assistance but not otherwise.      in my opinion, the Scottish Office have failed to prove,I  think that, once it is. known that there is no likelihood cfGovernment intervention, the non will get the nets by other
means.     4.   I would draw the attention, of the Cabinet to the following specific points.          In the first plaeo, in view of the numerous callsupon the Exchequer at the present tirao, I art unwilling to face an advance of  150,000 for this, purpose - even if it isto be recoverable later on.   It is particularly unwelcomewhen it involves a Supplementary Estimate in the first monthof the financial&apos;, year?..     5.   In addition, the possible repercussions of such, apolicy must be taken into accGunt.   Iho scheme provides anunusual type of assistance, namely, the direct advance  ofpublic funds to individuals without security.   Such a  measure would be acceptable.to many other industries besides the fishing industry.   Even in the fishing industry, itself, weleave out of account every branch except the herring fishingand inside the herring fishing, we confine  assistance to theScottish fishermen,,   It ii noted that in paragraph 11  ofthe Secretary for Scotland&apos;s memorandum it  is stated thatfew comparable cases would arise in England:  but at thesame time the English fisherman would seem to have a strong case foe equivalent,help in somo other shapo - e.g.  assistance towards  the removal of wrecks which interfere with fishing -if the Scottish scheme is not suited to his particular needs.     6.   I fear a further difficulty.   Assuming that&apos;theordinary credit facilities are insufficient to meet the needsof tho Scottish Fishermen, the proper remedy would seem  to lie in tho establishment of some scheme of  -co-operative credit.I appreciate that such a scheme could not be framed in  time for
the coming summer fishing; hut I am convinced  that  theprovision of direct State loans to individuals - even ifthe scheme is supposed  to be limited to one  year -  will seriously imperil the prospects of establishing aco-operative system among the Scottish fishermen,   fromthis point of view, it  would seem doubtful whether  thescheme, on a long view, would be in the interests .jf thefishermen themselves.     7.  As regards administration of the schema, theSecretary for Scotland  admits there will be  difficulties.,If the State embarks  on an enterprise of this kind, one oftwo things is likely  to happen.  Either the  undertaking.will be run carefully and strictly when the  scheme  will be unpopular and the administrative cost will-be high; or  theoperations will  be conducted with greater latitude  to the borrower than ordinary credit institutisns would give, inwhich oaae a good deal  of public money will  be lest and the thriftless nmong the  fishermen wilJUbe encouraged beyond their departs.           iscperienoe  in connection with the  scheme  for the disposal  of Admiralty drifters  to  ex-service fishermen suggests  that  in a quasi-benevolent scheme of  this  kind,, Government loans are  the last to  be repaid.&quot;  It  is  difficult to  resort to  legal measures  for recovery;  and there is always a  tende:acy  for political pressure to  be exercised.     C   A further  difficulty is likely  to be  experienced with the  &amp;et  making trade,  which will be tempted by the enhanced  demand to  increase  the price  or lewer the  quality ef the nets.   It is understood  that  the  Fishery  Board  think that -they will be able to control the  trade  on this point:
but when a Government Department sets its wits against anentire industry it is not easy to be confident that it will succeed,     9.  the Cabinet Ehculd realise that, while,  in theopinion of the Fishery Board, many of ths Scottishfishermen might he unable to fish this year It nothing were done,  it is not the case that rai&amp;es the son.erne tha whole ofthem would be enabled to go to sea.  In any event therewould net he enough nets ta go round.April 1924,(Initialled)  B3S0
