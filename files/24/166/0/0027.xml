I            (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF&apos; iilS BRITANNIC                       MAJ ESTI&apos;S GOVERNMENT.) SECRET..6 (24) -                      Wireless ^Services.              (Memorandum by the Postmaster General).CABINET.     1.  With reference to the provisional decision taken bythe Cabinet on the 12th instant in regard to therecommendations of the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee,I submit the following statement as to what will be involvedin this Country, and what is likely to bo involved in theDominions and India, if the recommendations of the Committeeare carried out.     2.  As regards this Country, it will be necessary toproceed with the enlargement of the Leafield Station (at aoost of  60,000), the extension of the new Rugby Station from12 to 16 masts (at a oost of  62,000), and the building of asecond station equivalent to Rugby (at a oost of about 500,000).   The first two works should be put in hand atonce, and the site for the further station should also beobtained immediately (at a oost of say  50,000);  but theconstruction of that station might well wait until theIndian station is commenced, which cannot (under the proposals;,&apos;of the Indian Government) bo before next autumn.   In thatoase a Supplementary Estimate for  200,000 will suffice for1924-25.   The enlarged Leafield and extended Rugby stationswill bo adequate at the outset, at least,  for communication  lwith Canada, South Africa and Australia, and for the limitedservice with Egypt now being carried on by Leafield.
m     3.   Before examining the position in the Dominions  andIndia, it may he well  to make it clear that,  under theCommittee&apos;s  recommendations,  the Government will  have a monopoly  not only  of  transmitting telegrams  to the Dominionshut also of  receiving  telegrams from them.   The  great hulkof the telegraph traffic to and from the Dominions isexchanged with this Country,  and, if the Marconi  stations inthe Dominions or India can only communicate with  us by means ofthe Government stations here, it is obvious that  any obstructionwould damage financially the  distant Marconi  stations as muchas the Government Stations here.   It is therefore improbable that, if once stations in.the Dominions and India are erectedand working, artificial difficulties will be  created.    Thepoint to be  considered is whether tho Marconi Company in thecircumstances will  proceed with the erection  of stations inthose Countries.     4.   A summary  of  the Committee&apos;s recommendations was sent out to the Dominions and India on the 26th February, andreplies  have now been  received from Canada, South Africa,Australia and New Zealand.   The Canadian reply refers inparticular to the Committee&apos;s recommendation  that the existingMarconi  service with Canada should be allowed to  continue in competition  with the service  to be instituted by  the Government,as an alternative to the withdrawal of the provisional permitnow held by  the Marconi Company for communication with canada,  and  the concentration of the Canadian service (likethe other Dominion  services)  in Government stations in thisCountry..  The Canadian Government state that the adoption ofthis recommendation will not  necessitate any  change in thegeneral  Wireless policy of Canada as outlined by  for. Grahamat the recent Imperial Economic Conference.   Mr-. Graham&apos;sstatement was as follows                                                 &quot;We
          &quot;We want  an efficient service and we are not     &quot;particular  how it  is  given to us at this end (i.e.,     &quot;the British end).    It is largely your business to     &quot;control wireless and  everything else in your own     &quot;territory&quot;.This statement of policy is equally consistent with the first alternative proposed by  the Donald Committee, namely, the concentration of  the whole  of the Dominion services inGovernment stations in this Country.   This  is the alternativefavoured, by the Post Office, and 1 reoommend that it be adhered to - an explanatory telegram boing sent to theCanadian Government.     5.  Mr. Donald personally prefers the second alternative,-namely, that, the Marconi Company should be allowed to carryon their existing Canadian service for a limited period, andthat the Post Office should compote with them, which he thinksis likely to lead to less difficulty with ths Marooni company and with Australia.   I  am not sure that this alternative would ease the situation as regards the Company or as regardsAustralia.   On the contrary, an exception in the oase ofCanada might weaken the  general position.   Indeed, it is &apos;already being asked why  Australia should not enjoy the samealternative of communication  with a Marconi station here thatthe Donald Committee have suggested for Canada.   On the whole,therefore, I prefer the  alternative of taking over the serviceentirely.     6.  The Committee suggest that, if the latter alternative is adopted, some  consideration should be given to the marconi company in respect  of the goodwill of the Anglo-Canadianbusiness which they have built up - although in their opinion the Company have  no legal claim, as they are working under a provisional permit; terminable&apos;, at any time.   I am consulting                                                      the
n: the Law Officers on the latter point, hut I have little doubt that the legal position is as stated by the Committee.   The Committee do not define the consideration they have in mind. It might take various forms:  for example, the Company are belioved to be carrying between 2,000,000 and 2,500,000 words a year to and from Canada.   If this traffic is transferred to a Government Station, a small royalty (say a halfpenny) per word might be allowed to the Company for a short term of years (say four).   This would represent a payment of about  5,000 a year for that term.   An ex gratia payment of this kind might well be dependent on the Company assuming a reasonable attitude as regards the other recommendations of the Committee.     7.  The affiliated Canadian Marconi Company already have a high power station at Glace Bay in Nova Scotia, which might continue to carry on communication with this Country by means of the Post Office station at Leafield.   It would clearly be in the interest of the affiliated Company that this station should continue in use, and, as the Marconi Company in this Country will be debarred from communicating with it, It will necessarily have to communicate with the Government Station. Hence there is not likely to be any difficulty so far as an Anglo-Canadian service is concerned.   The Canadian Company have for some time been considering the question of establishing a new station at Montreal, to replace the GlaceBay Station, but in view of increasing cable competition it is doubtful whether it would materialise,  oven if a new Marconi Station in this Country vwo licensed to communicate with it.Meanwhile  the Glace Bay Station can do all that  is necessary.Certain wireless interests in Canada, independent of the marconi Company, are proposing to establish a further stationfor communication with Great Britain.   If this comes to                                                   anything,                            y             -- .   gig;   \-,  g-&apos;g&apos;.&apos;:M.&apos; &apos;
anything, the Government station here would be free tocommunicate with those independent interests as wall as withthe Glace Bay station.     8.  It is part of the scheme contemplated by theAustralian Government that the Marconi Company, or itsCanadian affiliation, should erect a high power station atVancouver.   The Vancouver station would be mainly used fortraffic between Australia and Canada and the, United States,which is considerable, and it would no doubt also bo used fortraffic between these Countries and Japan and China.   Theproposals of the Donald Committee would not affect the utilityof the Vancouver station for these purposes, and there seems tobe no roason why the Marconi interests should not proceed with it.     9.  The South African Government have replied to theaffect that, although when their contract with the marconi company was entered into it was assumed that tho marconi company would have.been licensed to put up a correspondingstation in this Country, and although the Marconi intereststhrow doubts upon the efficiency of communication if thecorresponding station is worked by the British Post Office,yet the South African Government themselves see no objectionto this course, provided that a prompt and efficient service is given and a suitable organisation is set up.   Meanwhile the marconi Company are proceeding with the erection of the SouthAfrican station, which, as they have admitted,they are bound by their contract to complete and work.    10.  The New Zealand Government have replied stating thatthey strongly support the report and recommendations ofthe Committee.                    \\                                  ir;                        -   \                                                     11\    \
     11.   The chief difficulty - if difficulty arises - will no doubt  be in Australia.   The position hero is largelygoverned  by the agreement between the Commonwealth Governmentand Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited - a Marconisubsidiary.   By.the agreement the Amalgamated Wireless Companyundertook to increase its capital to the sum of  1,000,000 inshares of  1 each,  and of these the Commonwealth.was to take up 500,001 shares,.    The Commonwealth therefore control theCompany,     18.   By Clause 5 of the Agreement, the Company undertakes     (a)   To construct, maintain and operate in Australia thenecessary stations  and equipment for a direct commercialwireless  service between Australia and tho United Kingdom.     (o).   To arrange for the operation of suitablecorresponding stations in tho United Kingdom.     (f)   To provide the main trunk stations in Australia andthe United Kingdom within two years from the date of theagreement.     (g)   To arrange, within two years from the date of theagreement, for the erection and operation of a station inCanada capable of commercial communication with a high power station in Australia, and so equipped as to afford facilitiesfor distributing traffic throughout North America.     It is further provided as follows:-     The Company shall, within six months after the date ofthis agreement, or within such extended time.as therepresentatives of the Commonwealth on the Board may approve,                                                   enter
USenter  into  an  agreement  providing for  the  erection and operation of the  stations  mentioned  in paragraphs  (f)  and (g)of Clause 5 of this  agreement,  subject to  satisfactoryguarantees  of  efficiency.               -JC-                              &amp;    If  no  such agreement  is  entered into  within six  monthsafter  the date of this  agreement, or within such extendedtime (if any)  as  is  approved  under this Clause,  tho Commonwealthshall  bo entitled to cancel the agreement.    These  latter provisions  were necessary because theAmalgamated Wireless Company  is not  itself in a  position toconstruct high power stations.    In accordance with these provisions  the Company  Issued in February  1923 invitations to tender for  the construction of the Australian station.These  invitations were  nominally addressed to Wireless Companiesgenerally,  but they  were couched in  such a form  that  the parentMarconi  Company alone would be in a position to  fulfil theconditions&apos;.   The parent Marconi Company submitted a  tender(at a  price, it is understood,  of  487,000) which was accepted in September  1923.   The Marconi Company undertook, inaddition to erecting the station in Australia:-    To  arrange that suitable corresponding duplex stations in   England  and  Canada be provided, and also to arrange for   their operation in terms of the guarantees which will be   required,  and  to  specify what facilities they can provide   for the  collection and distribution of traffic to  and from   these stations.     13.  Under these provisions, it would appear to  be opento the Australian Government  either (a1) by means of their                                                controlling
controlling  interest  in the  Amalgamated Wireless  Company, toaccept  the Government stations  In this  Country as suitablecorresponding  stations, in which case there would he no further difficulty,  or (b)  to cancel the agreement with the  AmalgamatedWireless  Company  on the ground  that  the latter cannot fulfill their obligations as  regards the corresponding stations.     14.  The  telegram of March 26th:from the australian government,  of ?jhich  a oopy  is  attached (Appendix A) attempts to make four points:-     (a)  that the  Australian Company was formed  on  the    strength of an assurance that a  private company  would be    licensed to provide the  reciprocal  station in England:     (b)  that the Marconi Company cannot be held to their    Australian contract unless  they  are to be allowed to ereot    the reciprocal station in England:     (c)  that the other shareholders in the Australian Company    have  no  confidence in the efficiency of the Government    station  in England, and  that the Australian Government    would not  be  justified in forcing them to accept it as the    reciprocal station:,     (d)  that the Marconi Company should therefore  be allowed    to  erect a station in England, or,  alternatively, that    Australia  should  be licensed to do  so, which, of course,    comes to precisely the  same thing.     This telegram does not  appear to modify the  situation.The attempt  to establish that the British Government are boundto license the Marconi Company  is inconsistent with  Mr. Bruce&apos;sadmission that the ownership of the  station in Great britain is a matter  of domestic concern for  the British Government.There is  no  record of any undertaking that the Marconi Company,or any  other company,, should bo licensed for this purpose.                                                    In
In fact,  in December  1921,  (three months before the Australianagreement was  concluded),  the  Australian Government were informed  in an official despatch that British policy was tomaintain  imperial wireless  communications in the hands of theG-overnment, and that  His Majesty&apos;s Government would be considerably embarrassed by an application from a private company for the erection of a special station in this Countryfor direct communication with Australia.   This was confirmed in a subsequent telegram to the Commonwealth Government ofJuly 1922.     Mr.  Bruce is careful not to suggest that the australian government hold the view that Government stations in GreatBritain would be less efficient than Marconi stations, a view which there is no evidence whatever to-support.   It can hardly be claimed that the Wireless policy of the ImperialGovernment should be subordinated to the opinions which theprivate shareholders in the Australian Company are alleged tohold.     If the Cabinet decide to adopt the policy of the Donaldreport, a draft reply to the Australian Government is attached. (Appendix B).     15.  The following extract from one of  Mr. Bruce&apos;s statements  to the Imperial Economic Conference is to the point:-   -     &quot;If  we find the position is  that  some outside organisation is  taking up  an utterly unreasonable and irreconcilable attitude,  and is really trying  to hold  the Govornment to ransom,  then  it  seems  to me the Government must take very definite  action.   I do not know whether the British.Government would be  prepared  to do it, but&apos; if the final necessity comes it  is open to the British  Government to  erect  all the stations  ;:^.v,!.-  -:.-gg.:- . v- ggg     .-g: g         ,g.; ;gg      that  I- :  v:
that aro required in this Country.   Personally, I think thatwould ha a most unfortunate situation to arise;  I oan seeinnumerable difficulties with regard to patents and otherrights;  hut,&apos; a* the same time I would never be a party to allowing some outside body to hold a Government to ransom, andI would certainly not use the pressure that perhaps Australiacan bring to aid any persons to secure an arrangement which isnot a fair and proper one, and one to which they are not entitled&quot;.     16;  if the Commonwealth Government decided to cancel the agreement (which there is no necessity for them to do),and ifj as a consequence, matters in Australia had to be started again ab initlo&apos;, there is another course which mightbe considered, namely, the erection of the stations inAustralia, New Zealand and Western Canada by tho Pacific CableBoard, whose cables now connect those Countries.   The pacific cable Board is a Government undertaking, in which Australia;New Zealand, Canada and the Imperial Government are partners.They are at present considering the question .of duplicating at great cost the longest sections of their cables, namelyj thosebetween Fiji, Fanning Island and Vancouver.   They have funds in hand for this purpose amounting to nearly . 2,000,000, and,if they were to re^ly upon wireless for the duplicate route,they.could no doubt erect the necessary stations for somethingless than  1,500,000.   They have already been making certainexperiments in wireless reception at various plaoes on theirroute, but they have not seriously considered so ambitiousa scheme as is now suggested.   If the Australian Government,as partners in the Pacific Cable Board, were prepared to agreeto the Board undertaking&apos; the work, it seems possible that NewZealand and Canada might also agree.   In the circumstances,however, this solution is only suggested as a pis aller.    The                                                most      .  .  I&apos;:;!&apos;&apos;;&apos;:                   !;-. \\jj                       -
most expeditious  course  would no doubt  be to proceed by meandof the agreement  with the  Amalgamated Wireless Company.     17.   As regards India,  the  Indian  Government  have issuedinvitations for the establishment of a  Company, 60/2 of Tnhosacapital would be  offered in  India,  for  the establishment of  ahigh power station for communication with this Country&apos;., SouthAfrioa and Australia.   Applications must be made  by thebeginning of August.   The Marconi  Company are knom to havecontemplated applying for  a  concession  in accordance with this invitation, but it is possible that they may not proceed Ifthe recommendations of the Donald Committee are carried out.The erection of a station by the Marconi Company is, however,not the only possible solution.    The Indian station  is more likely than any other station to be remunerative,  and privateenterprise, If given the opportunity of establishing a station       willin India/certainly take  advantage of it.   The conditions laiddown by the Indian Government provide that the Indian Stationshall communicate with any station of the Imperial system inthis Country;  and the Indian representative at the ImperialEconomic  Conference agreed that  the policy to be adopted inthis Country is entirely a matter for His Majesty&apos;s Government.     18.   Any estimate of tho revenue and expenditure of theImperial  stations in this Country must  be highly speculative,inasmuch  as the revenue is necessarily  dependent upon -     (1)   The amount of traffic  which will be diverted from         the cables to the wireless service;     (2)   The amount of new traffio which the wireless         service will develop;     (3)   The distribution of the wireless traffic as between         full rate, half rate and quarter rate or  Press         messages.                      I     (4)   The policy of the  Cable Companies in reducing rates         to meet wireless competition.                                                   The
     The Loafield station is approximately paying its way andshould continue to do so.   The two Rugby stations willprobably entail an annual expenditure (including charges for interest and depreciation) of between  200,000 and  230,000per annum.   The revenue of the Rugby stations In the firstyears should be from  140,000 to  180,000 per annum.   an initial loss must therefore be anticipated, which is not likely to be less than  40,000 per annum and may reach as muchas about  80,000.   There is, however,&apos;a reasonable prospect that when the. services are fully developed this initial losswill be extinguished.     19.  The only possible alternatives to the proposals ofthe Donald Committee seem to me as follows;-   Firstly, thata Company should be formed here on the lines of the AustralianCompany, in which the Government should hold a controlling interest.   Apart from the inevitable delay, there are obviousParliamentary objections to the Government subsidising oapitaland aooepting responsibility for what would virtually be acommercial Company.   Moreover, If the private enterprisetaking part in such a Company were limited to Marconiinterests, the adoption of the proposal would consolidatethose Interests in a preferential position, and would leadto what successive Governments have tried to guard against,namely, a Marconi monopoly of wireless communication.   If,on the other hand, the Company Included other wirelessenterprises (such as the Radio Communication Company) thescheme would become complicated and unworkable - besidesprobably being unacceptable to the Marconi interests.     20.  The second alternative would be to license privateenterprise, subjeot to an agreed division.of traffic asbetween tho Marconi Company&apos;s stations, and Government stations                                                     It
It would still  remain to decide  whether there should heunrestricted competition between the stations or a regionalallocation of traffic or a pooling arrangement...   Under a                             *system of unrestricted ocmpfeitition; it &amp;aaias to. ma clear thatif the distant  stations wore Marconi stations and had the option of communicating either  with Marconi stations or with government stations in this Country, they would prefer towork with the Marconi stations  here, and that the government service would bo very seriously handicapped, if not starved.A regional allocation of traffic was strongly objected to bythe Marconi Company,&apos;and would  probably give rise to as much difficulty with tharn as would the Donald proposals.   there remains some form of pooling arrangement, which, the marconi company allege  had been practically agreed to by tho late government.  As a matter of fact, the terms were very farfrom having bean agreed between the parties.   Apart fromthis, any pooling arrangement which left tho Government in a semi-permanent  position of inferiority to tho Company  (inthat the Company would have taken two-thirds of the proceedsand the Government one-third only) is, in my opinion,objectionable.     21.  The following is a summary of my practical proposals:     (l)  To adopt generally as regards Empire communication         the recommendations of the Donald Committee, and to         proceed immediately with the enlargement of the         Leafiald Station  (at a cost of  60,000), the  extension         of the new Rugby Station.from 12 to 16 masts  (at a         cost of  62,000) and the purchase of a site for a         seoond station equivalent to Rugby  (at a cost of say          50,000).   The erection of the sosond Rugby wrald         not, however, be proceeded with until the proposed                                  \&apos;j             Indian
        Indian station is  commenced.    Tho  total  additional        amount required in the  forthcoming  financial  year        would  not  exceed  200,000.     (2)   As regards  the service  with Canada,  to  adopt  the        first  alternative  suggested by the  Donald Committee,        namely, to take over  the  existing Marconi service,        making some allowance (not  exceeding say   20&apos; ,000)        to the Company in  respect of  the goodwill of  the        business which they have  built up,  and to send  a        telegram to Canada explaining this  decision,     (3)   As regards  Australia, to reply to the telegram from        the Commonwealth Government  on the  lines  indicated in        Appendix B.     As regards services with  foreign  Countries outside  Europe,I would propose to offer licences to  the Marooni  Company,subject to a division of the  Anglo-Continental services withthe Company being  agreed to by  them.                                  -   V. H,AL POST OFFICE,  -  31st       1924.
APPEEDIX   AoTelegram from the Governor General of the Commonwealthof Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies(Dated 26th Maroh Received Colonial Offioe 9.55 a0m.26&apos;th Maroh, 1924.)Confidential Imperial Wireless.     Following from my Prime Minister.          Your telegram of 26th February has now beenconsidered by my Government,  While recognising that thequestion of how long-distance wireless  stations shall beprovided, in Britain is one of domestic  concern -for your Government we feel that if the recommendations of theDonald Committee that the Post Office should own allwireless stations in Great Britain in communication with overseas Dominions is given effect to by your GovernmentAustralia will be placed in the most unfair position.     At the Imperial. Conference in 1921 Australiadissented from the resolution approving Norman&apos;s schemeand indicated her intention to erect a station capableof direot communication.   Mr. Lloyd George-undertook thatno obstaole would be placed, in the way of a reciprocalstation being erected and worked in England,     Relying on this undertaking the australian government acquired a majority of interest in a private company with Which an agreement was signed in March 1922under which the Company was to erect a long distancestation in Australia and reciprocal stations in Britainand Canada,     In Febimary 1923 the Company called for tenders for i.h.&quot; erection of the station in Australia and required                                                   the
the tenderers to arrange provision and operation of corresponding stations in Britain and Canada.     In March 1923 Mr. Bonar Law stated in Parliamentlicence would be granted for erection of wireless station in Britain for communication with the Dominions.     In September 1923 tender of the Marconi Company forthe station above referred to was aooepted.   In accepting the tender, the Company required a guarantee from theMarooni Company of satisfactory transmission by Australian-British stations with the minimum nuabar of hours per day and number of words per hour and the service to beavailable for Australian traffic 24 hours per day; moneypenalty to be provided for failure to render thestipulated service;  reduction of rates provided for andequal division of profits to both stations.     Parliamentary Committee which investigated thequestion of erection of long distance wireless station in Australia advised that action should only be proceeded with if guarantees providing for monetary payment in theevent of the stipulated service not being provided were obtained.   These as stated were obtained t*us disposing ofall technical objections to the system.     If licenoe is not now&quot; granted to the marconi company to erect reciprocal stations in Britain, Australiacannot hold the Marooni Company to the contract and australia will be deprived of the benefits of a mostexcellent contract which safeguards her inti-rests inevery way unless of course the British Government isprepared to erect stations and give similar guarantees,,     A further difficulty arises in that one half less&apos;one share of the shares in the Company are owned by the                                             public
public and the Government has overwhelming evidence thatsuch shareholders are not prepared to proceed with thescheme if reciprocal station in Britain and reciprocaltraffic are to be in the hinds of a Government Department.In support of this view they state that they are notcontent to rely on the efficiency of a Government ownedand controlled station.     While my Government expresses no views on this contention it has to be admitted that private individualshaving invested their money in the Company are entitledto protest against that Company entering into reciprocal arrangements (upon which return of their money will to agreat extent depend) with a -partner in whose efficiency and competency they do riot believe.     This means that the amalgamated Company could onlyenter into arrangements with the British government by the Australian Government exercising Its controllingvoting power which only amounts to one share to force theremaining share holders to accept a course to which theyare opposed,   I doubt whether the legality of such action could be maintained;  .; morally it appears to be quiteimproper.     My Government also is in some difficulty inunderstanding why if private enterprise is entitled toreceive licence  to establish communication with a foreign country such as  the Argentine a Dominion  such as Australiashould be placed in what  is regarded as a less favourable position.      In view of  the fact  that Australia had been ledinto  her present position by the action of the BritishGovernment; that we have  obtained a most  favourablecontract with guarantees  for the erection of Australian                                              British
British station;   that our partner shareholder in theamalgamated Company will not agree to an arrangement forreciprocal relations with a Government owned station;and that service  to foreign countries can be arranged on basis we desire,  while Australia is precluded fromestablishing such service;  my Government asks that you should reconsider the position and should grant a licence to the Marooni Company to erect our reciprocalstation in Britain 30 as to enable the arrangements wehave already entered into to be completed.     In the event of your Government not being able toagree to this would they as a way out of the difficultyissue a licence to Australia to erect a station leaving it in this Government&apos;a hands to determine by whom thatstation shall be  erected and subject to the Governmentscontrol how it shall be operated.   ends.                            GOVERNOR GENERAL.i
Draft reply to Telegram from the Australian                  Government.     &quot;Your telegram of 2,6 Maroh concerning Empire Wireless.Would assure you that Imperial Government have no wish to placeAustralia or any other Dominion in an unfair position.   On thecontrary they wish to meet their views to the fullest possible extent consistent with what they believe is the best solutionof this important Empire problem.     They cannot agree that Australia,.in concluding its agreementwith Amalgamated Wireless Company, has boen misled by the actionof the Imperial Government.   At that tine the policy of tho&apos;Imperial Government was State-ownership of all Empire stations in this country.   Government have no knowledge of any undertaking direct or indiroct that Marconi Company would be licensed to erect a reciprocal station in this country.    On the.,contrary your Government were officially informed on the 19thDecember 1921 in connection with their proposed agroemont with the Amalgamated Company that the policy  hero was to maintainImperial wireless communication in the hands of the State andthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would be considerably embarrased by, an application from a private company for tho erection of astation in this country for communication with Australia.   Thispolicy&apos; was again emphasised in an official telegram sent to your Government on the l?th July 1922.     Your Government state that thoy have some difficulty inunderstanding why private enterprise should be licensed  toestablish communication with a foreign country such as theArgentine and not with the Dominions.   The Imperial Government                                                      howeverAppendix  B.
                                                            j r; ohowever regard Empire wireless oommunioations in an entirely-different light from those with foreign countries.   The samereasons which actuated tho Imperial Government in seouring aState-owned cable with Canada and in joining with partnerGovernments to secure a State-owned cable between Canada andAustralasia actuato the Imperial Government in wireless policy.These reasons do not apply to communication with foreigncountries.     To make an exception by licensing the Marconi Company for communication with Australia would render the Donald schemenugatory.   The alternative of licensing the commonwealth government  to provide a station hero would obviously from, yourtelogram bo equivalent to licensing the Marconi Company *     The Imperial Government do not share the doubts expressed inthe telegram under reply as to the efficiency of tho Governmentstations in this country, and they would point out that there isno evidence whatever that stations provided by private enterpriseare likely  to bo more efficient.,   The request which your government  makes,  that the Imperial Government&apos;s policy of Stateowned stations in this country should be modified by licensing aprivate company to conduct the Australian service, would appear tobo inconsistent with the- principle which was generally acceptedby the Imperial Economic Conference, that it is the domestic concern of  each country to determine the means by which the wireless&apos;stations within its own territory should bo provided and operated.   The Imperial Government therefore regret that theyare unable  to meet the views expressed by your Government anddepart in this respect from the recommendations of the DonaldReport.&quot;
