A leasehold Enfranchisement Bill is now before tho Houseof Commons.  Its purpose is to enable the lessee of any house  orpremises,  of which the original loase oxtended to not less  thanthirty years,  to acquire compulsorily, on giving six months&quot; notice to tho lessor j  the reversion of the loase *          Eiis  is a very old proposition,,  A similar Bill was introduced about the year 1889, when I was in the House of  Commons,by the late Mr,  Broudhurst and Sir Robert Keii.   It was supportedby the liberal  Party,  led by Sir Williaa Haroourto          But there was a split.,  After careful consultation withiir. Sidney Webb  and representatives of the Eabian Society,  I movedits rejection, and was supported by Mr0  Asqtilth and Sir Edward Grey,Our point  was  that it was undesirable to increase the number ofsmall and  irresponsible owners of fees simple or long leaseholds,and that the first interest to be  consulted was that of the community,who should either hive the power to acquire,  or be given extensivecapacity, for purchase  or control.,   This view prevailed with theHouse of Commons, although I am bound to add that it would not have succeeded  but  for tho support of the Conservatives,  who disliked theBill altogetho.ro          It seems to me that the ground wo then took,  in conjunctionwith Mr,  Sidney  Webb,  who,  though not in the House,  was in  close consultation with myself,  was the  right  view,  I know no reason why this policy should have changed to-day,  or why the spirit of the times should be  regarded as more favourable to tho diffusion ofPrivate landlordism.  I suggest that the Government should be adverseto tho Bill,(Intd.)   Ho  of C.*U 11th,  1924.
