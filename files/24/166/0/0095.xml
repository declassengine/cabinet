I CIRCULATE herewith, for consideration by the Cabinet, a  Note by theChairman of the  Committee  of  Imperial Defence  covering  the Report of  anInternational Commission of Jurists to consider  and report upon the Revision ofthe Rules of Warfare,  together  with the  Conclusions reached  thereon  by theCommittee of Imperial Defence.                                                  (Initialled)      J. R.  M.    May 23,1924.        NOTE BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.    I circulate herewith,  for the consideration of the  Cabinet,  a Despatch fromSir Rennell Rodd forwarding the Report of an International Commission of Jurists(Appendix &quot; A &quot;) to consider and report upon the Revision of the Rules of Warfare,together with, the Conclusions reached thereon by the Committee of Imperial Defence(Appendix &quot; B&quot;) after the Report had been examined in detail by a Sub-Committeewhose Report is attached (Appendix  &quot; C &quot;).    2.  The International  Commission was set  up as the result of  a  resolution adopted at the Washington Conference on  the Limitation of Armaments.  TheBritish  Empire  was represented  on the Commission by Sir Rennell  Rodd andSir Cecil Hurst, the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office.  Expert  advisers were attached to the Delegation from the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry.  Theother nations represented were the United States of America, France, Italy, japan and the Netherlands.   It is probable that at some later date the Report of theCommission will be laid before some more representative international body, whether at Geneva or elsewhere.    3.  The International Commission  has drawn up  a set  of rules  for  radio,contained in Part I, and for aerial warfare, contained in Part II, of their Report.    4.  The Committee  of Imperial Defence has recommended that the rules  for thecontrol of radio  in time of war, as recommended by the International Commission,should be accepted.  They have also recommended that the rules of aerial warfareshould be accepted, subject to certain technical observations  which are set forth inthe Conclusions  of  the Committee of Imperial Defence  and in the Report of  itsSub-Committee.    5  The most difficult point with which the International Commission had to dealwas the question of visit and search of merchant shipping by aircraft.  On this point the International Commission failed to reach agreement. The Committee of ImperialDefence have recommended the adoption, at any future International Conference  onthe subject, of the draft article proposed by the American Delegation on The HagueCommission, which is as follows :         &quot; Aircraft are forbidden to visit and search  surface or  sub-service vessels    without conforming  in  all  respects to  the  rules  to which surface  vessels    authorised to conduct visit and search are subject.[11636]
         &quot;In view of the irregularities to which the use of aircraft against merchant    vessels might give rise, it  is declared that aircraft cannot divert a merchant    vessel from its course without first boarding it; that in. no event may an aircraft    destroy a merchant vessel unless the crew and passengers of such vessel have first    been placed in safety; and. that, if an air craft.cannot, capture, a merchant vessel    in conformity with these rules, it must desist from attack and from seizure and    permit such vessel to proceed unmolested.&quot;    6., It should be noted, however, that the  Admiralty take  a  strong view that theBritish representatives at any future International Conference on this subject should,in the first instance, press for a prohibition of attack on merchant vessels by aircraft.It is only if such prohibition  is not accepted by the other Powers represented thatthe Admiralty agree to  the recommendation  of the Committee  of Imperial defence in favour of the adoption of the American Delegation^ proposal quoted above.    7. The action to which I ask the assent of my colleagues is the following :     (a.) To approve the recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence.    (b.) That the&apos;General Eeport of the International  Commission of Jurists should         1 be published.   1 -              ........1   1 -    (c.) That, before any communication is made to foreign Powers with regard to the     &quot;    Report of the Commission  of Jurists, the Governments of the Dominions          and India should be informed of  the decisions  which have been arrived       -   at by His Majesty&apos;s Government,  and should be invited to  express their          views thereon.    (d.) To approve the action taken by Sir  Rennell Rodd and Sir Cecil Hurst on          the important question  of  visit and search  of merchant vessels, and also          their general conduct of the negotiations, and that an expression of thanks          of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be conveyed to  them by the Foreign          Office.      &apos;                                                   (Initialled)       H.

APPENDIX  (A).   DESPATCH EEOM SIB RENNELL EODD TO THE MABQUESS CUBZON OF                          KEDLESTON.My Lord,                      The  Hague, February 19,  1923.   I  HAVE the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith thegenera] report of the Commission appointed to consider and report upon  the revision of the rules of warfare, as signed by the delegates of the British Empire, the United States of America, France,  Italy,Japan and the Netherlands.    The Commission assembled at TheHague on the 10th December last, and after adjourning during somsthree weeks for the Christmas holidays, concluded its labours on the evening of the 17th February.   The other British Delegate was  Sir Cecil  Hurst,  K.C.B.,  K.C.,the Legal Adviser  to the Foreign Office.  The  expert advisersattached to the Delegation were Air-Commodore C. L. Lambe,  C.B.,C.M.G., and Mr. J. M.  Spaight,  O.B.E., on  behalf of the AirMinistry;   Captain  J.   C.  Hamilton,   R.N., and CommanderCreagh, B.N., D.S.O., representing  the Admiralty, on whose recom-mendation Major F. W.  Home,  R.M.L.I., was  also  appointedTechnical Adviser on Wireless Telegraphy;  Colonel W. C. Venning.C.M.G., M.C., and Lieutenant-Colonel S. J. Lowe, D.S.O., O.B.E..for the War Office.   All the Powers taking part in the  Commission were represented by two Delegates, with the exception of  Italy, for which only onejurist was able to  attend.   The First American  Delegate, the  Honourable  John BassetMoore, was invited  to act as Chairman of the Commission.   Thepreliminary work was prepared  in  sub-committees,  one  of which,dealing with aerial warfare, was presided  over by Sir Cecil Hurst,and the other, dealing with wireless telegraphy, by the distinguishedFrench expert,  General  Ferrie, whose  place  I took during histemporary absence.   The report of  the Commission is divided into two parts, the firstdealing with radio in time of war, and the second with the rules of aerial warfare.   Part I of the report gives sanction to the use of the word &quot;radio&quot;in a sense perhaps new in Great Britain, though it has for some time
been adopted in the United  States.  In French the word  &quot; radio-telegraphie&apos;&apos;  includes radio-telegraphy, radiortelephony and radio-goneometry.   It was held that in English radio-telegraphy couldnot be regarded as having the same comprehensive significance.  Toavoid,  therefore, reiterated  enumeration, the  British  Delegationadopted the words  &quot;radio&quot;  and &quot;radio station&quot;  as the  Englishequivalent  of   &quot; radio-telegraphie&quot;   and   &quot;station  radio-tele-graphique.&quot;   Part II of the report,  dealing with  the rules of aerial&apos;warfare,describes so fully, when necessary, the attitude of the various Dele-gations that further comment appears  unnecessary.  The  greatestobstacles to general agreement were presented by the issues of aerial bombardment and the visit and search of vessels by aircraft.  Onthe former question, agreement was  eventually  reached, and it isonly just that I should record that this satisfactory result was largely due to the patience and perseverance  of the chairman, who  devotedmuch time and goodwill to conciliating  the insistencies and hesitation-tions of various  Delegations.   The difficulties presented by the question of  the use of  aircraft for  the exercise of  the  belligerent right of visit  and search  ofmerchant-vessels have, however, remained without a final solution.The report indicates with sufficient precision the point of  view ofthe various Delegations on this subject and shows that further con-sid ration must  be given to this question  before  any unanimous agreement can be arrived at.   The proceedings closed in a general  spirit of amity and goodwillafter an eloquent speech, reviewing the work of the Delegations, fromSenator Bolandi Rieci, the Italian Delegate,  and a cordial message of thanks to Sir Cecil Hurst for his admirable service as chairman and Reporter of the Sub-Committee on Aerial Warfare and generallyfor his work on the report as a whole in the Drafting  Committee.   I trust I may be allowed also to express my appreciation of theservices rendered by my colleague,  whose lucidity of exposition andgreat  experience in international negotiations  were of invaluableassistance to the Commission.   In conclusion, it only remains for me to testify to the cordial spiritof co-operation  and the high&apos; competence in their various capacitiesdisplayed by the experts  who attended the British Delegation  a3representatives of the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry,and to express our  acknowledgment to  Mr.  F.  E. F. Adam for his assistance as  secretary to the Delegation.   The work of the Commission has  extended over  a longer period than was perhaps  anticipated,  but  the  results,  which will,  I hope,find  approval,  could  not  have  been achieved  without exhaustiveexamination of questions which were new to experience and had tobe regarded from the point of view both of neutrals and of  possiblebelligerents, whose interests tend to be conflicting.(Signed)I have, &amp;c.

                          Enclosure.Commission  of   Jurists  to   Consider  and    Report upon the  Revision of the  Rules of    Warfare.                   GENERAL REPORT.  -  THE Conference on the Limitation of Armament at Washingtonadopted at its sixth Plenary Session on the 4th February, 1922, :iresolution&apos; for the appointment of a  Commission representing  theUnited States of  America,  the British Empire, France, Italy and japan to consider the  following questions :     (a.)i Do existing rules of international law adequately cover new          methods of  attack or defence resulting from the introdue-          tion or development, since The Hague Conference of 1907,          of neio  agencies of warfare ?    (b.) If not so, ivhat  changes in the existing rules ought to be          adopted&apos;in  consequence thereof  as a part of&apos; the  law of          nations ?    The  Commission was to report its conclusions  to  each  of  thePowers represented in  its membership.    The Resolution also provided that those Powers should thereuponconfer as to the acceptance of the report and the course to be followedto secure the consideration of its recommendations by the othercivilised Powers.    By a second resolution adopted at the same session  it was agreedto. exclude from  the jurisdiction of  the  Commission  the rules ordeclarations relating to submarines and to the Use of noxious gasesand chemicals already  adopted by the Powers in the said Conference. .   With  the  unanimous  concurrence of  the Powers mentioned inthe first of the above resolutions  an invitation to participate in thework of the Commission was extended to and accepted by the Nether-lands Government.  It was also  agreed that the programme of theCommission should  be limited to the preparation of rules relatingtc aerial warfare, and to rules  relating to the use of radio in time ofwar.                            .    The United States Government proposed that the  commission should.meet on the 11th  December,  1922,  at The Hague, and therepresentatives of  the six Powers mentioned above assembled on that,date.in the Palace of Peace. At the second meeting of the Commis-sion the  Honourable  John Bassett Moore, First Delegate  of theUnited States, was elected President of the Commission. -   The Commission has prepared a  set of rules for the  control of radio in time  of war, which are contained in Part I  of this Report,and a set of rules  for aerial warfare, which are contained in Part ii of this Report.
   The Commission desires to add that it believes.that if these sets of  rules  are  approved i and brought into force, it will be  foundexpedient to make provision for their re-examination after a relativelybrief term of years to see whether any revision is necessary.                           PART  I.   Rules  for the Control&apos; of&quot;Radio in  Time of War.   The regulation  of the use of radio in time of war is not a newquestion.   Several international conventions  already  contain pro-visions on  the subject,  but  the  ever increasing development of thismeans of communication has rendered it necessary that the whole matter should be reconsidered, with the object of completing andco-ordinating existing texts.  This is  the more important in view ofthe fact that several of the existing international conventions havenot been ratified by all  the Powers.   The articles  of  the  existing conventions  which deal  directly  or indirectly with radio-telegraphy in time of war are as  follows :    The Land War  Neutrality Convention (No. V of 1907) prohibitsin article 3 the erecting of radio stations by belligerents on neutralterritory and also the use by belligerents of any radio station estab-lished on neutral territory before the war for purely military purposes and  not previously opened for the  service  of  public messages.Article 5 obliges the neutral Power not to allow any such proceeding by a belligerent.   Under article 8  a neutral Power is not bound to forbid or restrict the employment on behalf of belligerents of radio stations belongingto it or to companies or  private individuals.   Under article 9  the neutral  Power must apply to the belligerentsimpartially the measures taken by it under article 8 and must enforcethem on private owners of radio stations.   Article  8  of  the Convention for  the Adaptation of the geneva convention to Maritime Warfare (No. X of 1907) provides  that thepresence of a radio installation on board a hospital ship does not of itself justify  the  withdrawal of the  protection to which a  hospital ship is entitled so long  as she does not commit acts harmful to theenemy.   Under the Convention concerning Neutral Eights and Duties  inMaritime Warfare (No.  XIII of 1907) belligerents are forbidden,  aspart of the  general prohibition of the use of neutral ports and watersas a base of  naval  operations, to erect radio stations therein, andunder, article 25 a neutral Power is bound to exercise such supervisionas the means at its disposal permit to prevent any violation of thisprovision.   The unratified Declaration of London of 1909, which was signed by the Powers represented  in the Naval Conference  as embodyingrules which corresponded in substance with the generally recognisedprinciples of international law,  specified in articles 45  and 46 certain
acts in which the use of radio-telegraphy might play an  important part as acts of unneutral service.   Under article 45 a neutral vessel was to be liable to condemnation if she was on a  voyage speciallyundertaken  with a view to the transmission of intelligence in theinterest of the enemy.  Under article 46 a neutral  vessel was to becondemned  and receive the same treatment as would be  applicableto an enemy merchant vessel if she took a direct part in hostilitiesor was at the time exclusively devoted to the transmission of intel-Intelligence in the interest of the enemy.  It should be borne in mind that by article 16 of the Rules for Aerial Warfare an aircraft is deemedto be engaged in hostilities if in the interests of the enemy shetransmits intelligence in the course of her flight.    The  following provisions have a bearing on the question of thecontrol of radio in time of war, though the conventions relate princi-pally to radio in time of peace.   These provisions  are articles 8,and 17 of the International Radio-Telegraphic Convention  of london of 1912.  Of these provisions article 8 stipulates that the working of radio-telegraph  stations shall  be  organised  as far as possible  insuch a manner as not to disturb the service of  other radio stations.Article 9 deals with the priority  and prompt treatment  of calls  of distress.   Article 17 renders applicable to radio-telegraphy certain provisions of the International Telegraphic Convention of St. Peters-burg of 1875.  Among the provisions of the Convention of 1875 made applicable to  radio-telegraphy  is  article 7,  under  which the HighContracting Parties reserve to themselves the right to stop the trans-mission of any private telegram which appears to be  dangerous to thesecurity of the State or contrary to the laws of the country, to public order or to decency.  Under article 8, each Government reserves  to itself the power to interrupt, either totally or partially, the systemof the international telegraphs for an indefinte period if it thinksnecessary, provided that it immediately advises  each of  the other contracting Governments.    Regard has also been given to the terms of the Convention for the safety of life at sea, London, 1914.    With regard to the radio-telegraphy conventions applicable  intime of  peace, it should be remembered that these have not been revised since 1912, and that it is not unlikely that a conference maybefore long be summoned for the purpose of effecting such revision.    The  work  of the Commission in framing the following rules forthe control of radio in time of war has been facilitated by the prepara-tion and submission to the Commission on behalf of  the  American delegation of  a draft code of rules.  This draft has been used as thebasis of  its work by the Commission.    The  first article which  has been adopted  cannot be appreciatedwithout reference to Article 8 of the Radio-Telegraphic convention of 1912.  This latter article enunciates the broad principle that theoperation of radio stations must be organised as far as possible  insuch a manner as not  to disturb the service of other stations of thekind. The object of article 1 is to demonstrate  that this principle isequally to prevail in time of war.  Needless to say, it is not to apply
as between radio stations of bpposingbelligerents.  In the.same way as in time of peace the general principle cannot be applied absolutely.so also in time of war it can only be observed &quot; as far as possible.&quot;                             Article 1.    In time  of war the working  of radio stations shall continue to heorganised, as far as possible, in such  manner  as not  to disturb theservices  of other radio stations.   This provision does not  apply asbetween the radio stations of opposing  belligerents.    Article 17 of the  Radio-Telegraphic Convention of 1912 enablesStates to regulate or prohibit the use  of radio stations within their jurisdiction  by rendering applicable to radio-telegraphy certain pro-visions of the International Telegraphic Convention of 1875.    Inparticular it is articles 7 and 8 of that Convention which  enable such measures of control or prohibition to be taken.   The object of article  is to make it clear that such rights subsist equally  in time of war.  .                            Article 2.    Belligerent and  neutral Poicers inay  regulate or prohibit  theoperation of radio stations within their jurisdiction.    The next article  is really  only an adaptation of articles 3 and 5of  the  Land Warfare  Neutrality  Convention  (No.  -V of  1907).Article 3 (b) of that  Convention only prohibits the  use of any radio-telegraphic  installations established by belligerents before  the.war-on  the territory of a neutral Power for purely military purposes.The object of article 3 as now adopted is to prohibit any erection oroperation by a belligerent Power or its agents of radio stations withinneutral territory.    The wording shows that the responsibility of the  neutral state is  affected as well  as that of the  belligerent State in the  case  inquestion. The words &quot; personnes a son service &quot; in the French textare employed in the same sense as the word  &quot; agents &quot; in the Englishtext.    It should be understood that neutral Governments are bound touse the means at their disposal  to prevent the acts  which the articleis designed to stop.  This implies that they will be responsible in anyserious case  of negligence.                            Article 3.    The erection or operation  by a belligerent Power or its agents of radio stations xcithin neutral jurisdiction constitutes  a violation  of neutrality on the part of such  belligerent as ivell as on the part ofthe neutral  Power which permits the erection  or operation  of suchstations.                        vjf;   Article 4 covers the same ground, so far as concerns radio, as that provided for. in articles 8 and 9 of Convention V of 1907 i mentioned
above;  but while  article 8 stipulates that  a neutral Power is notbound to forbid or restrict the use of wireless installations by a belli-gerent, and article  9 relates to the restrictive or preventive measures taken by a neutral Power for this purpose, measures  which  must beapplied impartially to the belligerents, article 4 imposes on neutralPowers the duty of  preventing the  transmission by radio of  any information destined for a  belligerent concerning military forces or military operations.    This article is a compromise.  On.one side one Delegation pointedout that the 1907  system had stood  the test during  the war whenneutral Governments had taken under article 9 of the 1907  Conven-tion restrictive or preventive measures which were quite satisfactory.On the other  side it was pointed out  that those measures had  beentaken precisely for the purpose of complying with  the obligationimposed by neutrality, and that it would be well to define this obliga-tion so as to help and protect  neutral  Powers in  preventing theviolation of  their neutrality and thereby  reducing the probability oftheir  becoming involved in  the war.  Agreement was reached on thebasis  of a text indicating exactly the character of the messages pro-hibited,  viz.,  messages  concerning  military forces  and  militaryoperations.  It is understood that the prohibition would not cover therepetition of news which has already become public.   It has been agreed that  the article does not render necessary theinstitution of  a censorship  in  every neutral country  in every  war.The character of the war and the situation of the neutral  country may render  such measures unnecessary.   It goes without saying thatneutral Governments are bound  to  use the  means at  their  disposal to prevent the transmission of the information in question.   The second paragraph merely reproduces the first paragraph ofarticle 9 of the  Convention of 1907.  The phase &quot;destined for abelligerent&apos;&apos; covers all  cases where the  information  is intended toreach the belligerent, and not  merely  messages which are addressedto the belligerent.                            Article 4.   A  neutral Power is not called upon to restrict or prohibit the useof radio stations which are  located ivithin its jurisdiction, except sofar as may be necessary to prevent the transmission  of informationdestined for a  belligerent  concerning military forces or  militaryoperations and except as prescribed by article 5.   All restrictive or prohibitive measures taken  by a  neutral Powershall be applied impartially  by  it to the belligerents.   The legislation of a large number of Powers, for instance, that ofthe Powers represented in the  Commission, already provides for theprohibition of tho use of radio installations  on board  vessels within their jurisdiction.  In harmony with articles, 5 and 25 of the Conven-tion concerning the Eights and Duties  of Neutral Powers in MaritimeWarfare (No.  XIII of 1907), article 5  enacts the continuance of thisregime in time of war and  makes it obligatory for all mobile radio stations.
    Belligerent mobile radio stations are bound within the jurisdic- tion  of  a neutral State to  abstain  from  all use  of  their  radio apparatus.  Neutral Governments are bound to employ the means at their disposal to prevent such use.    The transmission  of military intelligence for the benefit  of  a belligerent  constitutes an  active  participation  in  hostilities and therefore merchant vessels  or private aircraft  have no  right  to commit such an act.  If they do so they must be content to  lose the immunity which, their non-combatant status should  confer.    The vessel or aircraft concerned renders itself liable to  be  fired upon at  the moment when the act is committed and is also  liable to capture.   In case of -capture the vessel  or  aircraft  will, if the facts be  established, be  dealt with in the prize court on the  same footing as an enemy  merchant vessel  or  enemy private  aircraft. Members  of the  crew  and  passengers, if implicated, are to be regarded  as committing  an act  in violation  of the laws of  war.  A neutral vessel  or  aircraft which  has :been  fired  upon   without adequate  justification will be entitled to address a demand for com- pensation to the competent  authorities.    Jurisdiction over  such claims might with advantage be conferred upon the prize court.    The second  paragraph of the  article  places  neutral merchant vessels or neutral  aircraft  when on  or over the high seas  in  a position which corresponds to that laid  down by  article 4 for  radio stations in neutral territory.  Such radio stations on land must not transmit information destined for a belligerent concerning military forces or  military operations and the neutral  Power must see to it that this rule  is observed.  Mobile radio stations when on or  over the high  seas are not  subject to the control  of the neutral Govern-- ment to the same extent as radio stations on land, and consequently the rule  laid down in this article does  not  impose any obligations on  the neutral  Government.    The neutral mobile radio stations themselves will, however,  be subject  to the same measure  of  pro- hibition as the radio stations in neutral territory.  They must not transmit information of the nature specified which is destined forthe belligerent.                                               .  .    The distinction between the acts dealt  with  in  the  first  and second paragraphs is that in the first and graver case it is assumed that the  merchant vessel or aircraft will have been  acting  in  con-nivanee with the enemy.  In flagrant cases, as for instance, where the vessel or aircraft  is found  transmitting intelligence as to themovement or strength of military forces to  an enemy  in order to enable the latter to shape  his  movements  accordingly, such  con-nivance would be presumed.    The phrase.&quot; destined for a  belligerent&quot; has the  same meaning as in article 4.   As in the case of article 4, it is understood that the prohibition  would  not cover  the repetition of  news  which  has already become public.    The collection by  the belligerent  of  the  necessary proofs to                                           y/i   -
establish his ease against an aircraft or a vessel may take time.   the examination of  the  message logs of many other vessels  or aircraftmay be necessary before responsibility can be fixed upon the  par-ticular  vessel  or  aircraft  which  transmitted  the  incriminatingmessage.   It is &quot;therefore hot possible to limit the right of Capture tothe duration of  the  voyage or flight during which  the message was sent.   How long the liability to capture should subsist was a  moredifficult point to determine.  Agreement was ultimately reached ooa basis of one year.   It is realised that the risk of capture during this period will  be agreat prejudice  to neutrals, but on the other hand  the injury done to the belligerent by the transmission by radio of improper messagesmay under modern  conditions of warfare be irreparable,  and  there-fore the, sanctions attached to the rule must be serious.  The neutralwill, however, not be gravely inconvenienced by the measures neces-sary to protect himself against any violation of the rule.   In the  case of all aircraft and of merchant vessels  which are notcarrying passengers, no  great injury will result from the prohibitionof radio messages other than those which are authorised by article 9,and in the case of merchant vessels carrying passengers, there canbe no insuperable difficulty in the institution on board the merchant vessel, if it is thought necessary, of the same measures as the neutralState may  institute on land to protect itself under article 3.   Paragraph 3 is  limited to neutral  vessels and  aircraft becauseenemy vessels  and  aircraft are  liable  to capture  at any time byreason of their enemy status.   It goes without  saying  that  as  capture  is  a belligerent right  itcannot be  exercised  except  in time  of war, and therefore if the warterminates before the expiration of the  time  limit, the liability t&apos;icapture is at an  end.   The Netherlands Delegation has made a reserve on the subjectof this article.  It feels  that the difficulties of obtaining satisfactoryproofs  against a neutral vessel or aircraft in the  prize  court  will beso great in these cases that provision should be made for the inter-national review  of prize court decisions under  this  article.    In its opinion the Permanent  Court of International Justice would be themost appropriate tribunal for this purpose.                            Article 6.   1.

A neutral vessel or neutral aircraft which transmits when on or over the high seas information destined for a belligerent concern-ing military  operations or military forces shall be liable to capture.The Prize  Court may  condemn the vessel or aircraft if it considersthat the circumstances justify condemnation.   3. Liability  to capture of a neutral vessel or aircraft on accountof the acts referred  to in paragraphs (1) and (2) is  not extinguished
 by the conclusion of the voyage or flight on which, the vessel or mt-, craft was engaged at the time,  but shall subsist for a.period of one year after the act complained of.   Apart from the question of the acquisition by. the enemy of infor- mation, the use of radio installations by merchant vessels or aircraft may very well be a source of great embarrassment to the commander of a belligerent force.  Not merely may it be essential to him to keep secret the strength of his forces or the operations in which they are engaged,  but it may be. necessary to ensure that there should be no interference  with his communications.   Further provisions  are, therefore, required to complete the protection afforded to belligerents by article 6.   For this purpose  power is given to a belligerent commander to&apos; warn off neutral vessels and neutral aircraft and to oblige them to alter their course so that they will not approach the scene of the operations of the armed forces.   A second right given to a belligerent commander is to impose on neutral vessels  and  aircraft a  period  of silence  in the use of then- transmitting apparatus when in the immediate vicinity of the forces under his command.  No-matter what technical measures may be taken by  neutral mobile stations in accordance with the provisions of article 1,  their messages, if made at a short distance from the receiving apparatus of  belligerent forces,  might  interfere with  the working of such apparatus, and such interference might prevent the hearing of messages to or from the commanding officer or the other units under his command.   To  avoid undue hardship to neutrals, the faculty conferred upon the belligerent commander is limited to the duration of the operations in which  he is engaged at the time.   The article presupposes the actual presence of naval or aerial forces engaged in operations, and that the measures will  not be applicable to  widely extended zones or to zones in which no military action is taking place.   It is also understood that the change of course provided for in the first paragraph of the article must not prevent a ship or an  aircraft from continuing its voyage and from reaching its port of destination.   The article is confined in terms to neutral vessels and  aircraft because the belligerent  commanding officer requires no  special pro- vision to protect himself against the operations  of enemy vessels and enemy aircraft.   It will be noted that the terms in which the article is drafted as well as those employed in articles 6 and 8 would cover neutral publicvessels or aircraft.   This does  not imply any intention to encroach upon the rights of neutral States. It is assumed that no such neutralpublic  vessels or aircraft would attempt to  interfere in any such manner with the naval  or  aerial operations conducted by the forcesof a State engaged in war.                           Article  7.   la  case  a  belligerent  commanding officer considers  that  the sticcess of the operation in which he is engaged may be prejudiced
 by the presence of vessels or aircraft equipped ivith radio installations in the immediate vicinity of his armed forces or by the use of such installations therein,  he may order neutral vessels  or neutral air- craft on or over the high seas :    1. To alter their course to such an extent as will be necessary w prevent, their  approaching  the  armed forces  operating  under  his command;  or          &apos;             ........    2. Not to make use of their radio transmitting apparatus while in the immediate vicinity of such forces.        -  -i-1  .  A..neutral vessel or neutral, aircraft, which does not conform to.such. direction of which it has had notice, exposes itself to the risk of being fired upon.    It will also be liable to capture, and may  be condemned if the Prize Court considers that the circumstances justify condemnation. .                                ,    Article 8 was intended to avoid, as far as possible, the eventuality of one of the belligerents being able to find  on board a neutral mobile radio station any texts of radio messages transmitted from the radio stations of the belligerents and not destined for such neutral  mobile station. &apos;    Such radio messages might possess military importance, and  the neutral would  thus involuntarily  assist one of the. belligerents by furnishing him with the means of becoming acquainted with such radio messages.   . The seizure  of the  texts,  entailing as it  will the removal from  the official, log of the pages on which  the operator enters the messages transmitted and received, together  with an indication of the hour of such transmission and reception, has appeared to the Commission to be a sufficient penalty in view of the fact that such a proceeding would attract the attention of the administration to which the  mobile station  belongs,  and would show that the responsible persons in. the service  of that station had not. obeyed the  provisions of the present article.   Provision is  only made for the mere removal by the belligerent of the relevant pages.          ;   The origin of the radio messages received is shown  by the indica- tions at the beginning of the message or in the call-sign.    Military stations use the indications entered in the register of the International Bureau at Berne, or else secret  indications which do  not appear in that official register.   No written record  should  therefore be pre- served of  radio-telegrams which are preceded either  by the indica-tions of a belligerent military station or by an unknown indication.   It is to be noted that the text of this article does  not exclude the application  of sanctions directed against unneutral service, if it is proved that the breach of the provisions in question was committedwith an intention of rendering unneutral service.                            Article  8.   Neutral mobile radio stations shall refrain from keeping any record of radio messages received from belligerent military radio stations,unless such messages are addressed to themselves.
IS   Violation of this rule will justify  the  removal by the belligerentof the records of such intercepted messages.   In the first paragraph of article 9  the Commission was anxious toindicate that belligerents who heard  signals or messages of distressmust, when deciding whether or  no they would respond  to  suchsignals, take into account  both their duties to humanity and  their military duties.   The  second  paragraph  is  inspired  solely  by  sentiments  of humanity with a view to saving human life at sea.  The text specifiesclearly that every mobile station finding itself in danger or perceivingau immediate danger &apos;for other mobile  stations will have the right,however  it  may be  affected  by other provisions of these rules, to transmit messages in order to ask for  help or to signal the danger fornavigation which it has perceived.  By the words &quot; messages whichare indispensable to  the safety of navigation,&quot; should be understoodonly such messages as are immediately  necessary for preventing thecollision, stranding or loss  of ships or aircraft.                            Article 9.   Belligerents are  under  obligation to comply  with the provisionsof international conventions in regard to distress signals and distressmessages so far as their military operations permit.   Nothing in these rides shall be understood to  relieve a belligerentfrom  such  obligation or to  prohibit the transmission  of  distresssignals, distress messages and messages which are indispensable tothe safety of navigation.   Article 10 is inserted to prevent the employment of signals andmessages of distress as ruses  of war.  It is justified by considerations of honour and humanity.    Persons  who violate the rule may  be punished.                            Article 10.   The perversion of radio  distress  signals  and distress messagesprescribed by international conventions to  other than  their normal and legitimate purposes constitutes a  violation of the laws of war and.renders the perpetrator personally responsible under  internationallaw.                                                        ....,-(&apos;-;   The purpose of  article 11 is to show clearly that  the  questionwhether an act which involves a breach of these rules constitutes also an act of  espionage  cannot be answered  except  by reference to. therules  of  international law which determine  what  acts amount  toespionage.                            Article 11.                         ,   .;   Acts not otherwise constituting espionage are not espionage  byreason of their involving violation of these rules.   The purpose of article 12 is toidefine  clearly the position of the radio operator so  far as regards  personal  liability to punishment.
The operator works in his cabin where he executes the orders of thoseabove him.  Consequently it is right that he should incur no personal responsibility merely because he has executed orders which he hasreceived in the discharge of his duties as radio operator.   liability to punishment for acts which contravene rules  such  as  articles or 10 falls on those who have given the orders for such acts.                           Article 12. 1   Radio operators  incur no  personal responsibility from the merefact of carrying out the orders which they receive in the performance of their duties as operators.    It has not been thought necessary to insert in the rules an articledefining the word  &quot;radio-station&quot; or &quot;station radio-telegraphique.&quot;The phrase is used in both texts as covering radio-telegraphic stations,radio-telephonic stations, radio-goneometrie stations and generallyall stations which use Hertzian waves transmitted through air, wateror earth.&apos;:: The - Japanese  Delegation submitted  to the  Commission  thefollowing proposal:     &quot; The belligerent may take such measures as to  render inopera-tive the coastal radio stations in enemy jurisdiction, irrespective oftheir owners.&quot;    After examining and discussing this proposal, the Commissioncame to the conclusion that it was not necessary to  insert a  specialarticle referring to the subject.  It was of opinion that the texts ofother international  conventions or  the usages of war covered  thequestion in  all its practical aspects and gave the right to take  themeasures contemplated in the Japanese  proposal.,:   The Land Warfare  Regulations  and  the  Naval BombardmentConvention, 1907 (No. IXof 1907), permit the bombardment of  coastaliadio stations by land or naval forces.   Article 24  of the rales foraerial warfare enables similar measures to be taken by  the air forcesagaiiist radio stations  used for military  purposes.    Furthermorearticle 53 of the Land Warfare Regulations authorises the seizureby  a  belligerent in  occupation of enemy territory of  coastal radio stations, even if such stations belong to  private individuals.    An interesting proposal  was submitted by the Italian Delegationfor protecting the radio-telegraphic  communications  of  combatantforces  by the establishment around them of a  kind  of  &quot;zone ofsilence.&quot;  The Commission agreed that this idea was  already impliedin the text of article 7, and that it was consequently not necessary toexpress it in a special article.
         ........799                          PART  II.                 Rules  of Aerial Warfare.   In the preparation of the code of rules of aerial warfare the Corn-mission worked on the  basis of a draft submitted by the  American delegation.   A similar  draft, covering in general the same ground,was submitted  by the British Delegation.  In the discussion of thevarious articles adopted by the Commission the provisions  containedin each of these drafts were taken into consideration, as  well  asamendments and proposals submitted by other Delegations.                          CHAPTEB I.          APPLICABILITY :  CLASSIFICATION AND REMARKS.   No attempt has been made  to formulate a definition of the term*&apos; aircraft,&quot;  nor  to enumerate the  various categories of  machineswhich are covered by the term.  A statement of the  broad principlethat the rules adopted apply to  all types of aircraft has been thoughtsufficient, and article 1 has been framed for this purpose.                            Article 1.   The rules of aerial warfare apply to all aircraft, xvhether lighter orheavier than air,  irrespective of whether they are, or are not,  capableoi floating on the ivater.   For States which are parties to the Air Navigation Convention of1919, aircraft are divided by article 30 into two classes, State aircraft and private aircraft,  State aircraft  being  sub-divided into military aircraft and aircraft exclusively employed in  State service, such  asposts, customs  or police.   The article also provides, however, that state aircraft,  other than military,  customs and police aircraft, areto be  treated as private aircraft,  and subject tz such to all the pro-visions of that Convention.  For practical purposes, therefore, states which are parties to the Convention of 1919 divide aircraft in time ofpeace into three categories :     (a.)  Military  aircraft.    (b.)  State aircraft employed for customs and police purposes.    (c.)  Private aircraft and such  State aircraft as are employed for          purposes other than  those enumerated in (b).   The  Convention of 1919  has not yet become  by  any  meansuniversal, but  it would be so inconvenient for States, which areparties to it, to come under different rules in time of war, that account has been taken of the  provisions of the  Convention when framing the articles adopted by the Commission.   It has also been necessary to take into account the fact  that Italy has entrusted the supervision ,of the customs service to the militaryforces, a fact which has prevented the adoption of exactly the same
  language as that  employed in article 30 of the Convention of 1919.  When read in conjunction, however, with article 5 below, it  will be  found that the classification adopted by the code of rules of aerial  warfare corresponds very nearly with that  prescribed in article 30 of  the Convention mentioned  above.                              Article 2.     The following  shall be deemed to be public aircraft:         (a.)  Military aircraft.        (b.)  Non-military aircraft exclusively employed  in the public               service.     All other aircraft shall be deemed to be  private aircraft.     A clear distinction must  be made between aircraft which form part of the combatant forces in time of war and those which do not.   Bach class  must be easily recognisable; this is essential if the immunities to which  non-combatant aircraft are entitled  are to  be respected. Article 3 has been framed.with this object.                             Article 3.    A  military aircraft shall bear an external mark indicating its nationality and military character.    Public non-military aircraft are not in command of persons com- missioned or enlisted in the  fighting forces; consequently there must be evidence on  board  the aircraft of the service  in which they are engaged.  Such evidence is  afforded by their papers.  It will be seen by reference to article 51  below that aircraft of this class may be visited for the purpose of the verification of their papers.                             Article 4.    A  public non-military aircraft  employed for  customs or  police purposes shall carry papers  evidencing the  fact  that it is exclusively employed  in the public service.   Such  an aircraft shall bear  an external mark indicating its nationality  and its public non-military character.    Article 5  has been  adopted for the purpose  of  regulating the position  of  State-owned  aircraft employed in the postal service,  or for commercial purposes.   Such aircraft will be engaged in  inter- national traffic which  should properly subject them to the  sanrs measures of control as those to which private aircraft are subject. They should also bear the same marks.    In  terms the article  applies to all public non-military aircraftother than those employed for customs or police purposes,, followingin  this respect  the  language  adopted  in the  last paragraph  ofarticle  30 of the Air Navigation Convention of 1919.  It is in connec-tion with aircraft employed  in the postal  service or for  commercial purposes&apos; that it will find its chief application.
&apos; -isa    Objection has been expressed to this  article by the  Netherlands Delegation on the  ground that its  effect will be to subject State- owned aircraft to capture and to the jurisdiction of belligerent prize courts.                             Article 5.    Public  non-military  aircraft other  than  those employed  for customs or police purposes shall in time of war hear the same external marks, and for  the purposes of these rules shall be treated on  the same footing, as private aircraft.    Private aircraft must in time of war bear marks to indicate their nationality and character and to enable the aircraft  to be identified. It would be inconvenient that the marks to be  borne in war time should differ from those borne in time of peace.  For peace time  the marks  which a private aircraft is  to bear are prescribed in the  Air Navigation Convention of 1919.  This Convention,  however, is  not universal in character and account must be taken of the position of States which are not parties to it.  Nevertheless,  all  States, whether parties to the Convention or  not,  will  before  long have enacted legislation as to  the marks which aircraft of that nationality are to bear.  The Commission has therefore felt that it will be  sufficient to lay down as the rule for time of war that aircraft must bear the marks v inch are prescribed by the legislation in force in their own country. Foreign Powers, whether belligerent or  neutral, are not concerned with the enforcement of that legislation as such; that is a matter  for the municipal courts of the country concerned.   The object of the article is to  afford to belligerent and neutral authorities a guide  as to the marks which a private aircraft must bear.                            Article 6.   Aircraft  not  comprised in articles 3  and  4 and deemed to  he private aircraft shall carry such papers and hear such external marks as are required by the  rules in force in their mvn country.  These marks must,  indicate their nationality and character.   Great abuses might  prevail if the  external marks  affixed  to  an aircraft could be altered while the machine was in flight.  It is also necessary that the marks should be clearly visible.   The principles adopted in article 7 are in harmony with the provisions of the Air Navigation Convention  of 1919.                            Article  7.   The external marks  required by the above articles shall  he  so affixed that they  cannot be altered in flight.  They shall be as large as is practicable and shall he visible from above, from below,  and from each side.                                                      &apos;&quot;&apos;   Each State chooses  for itself the  marks which its aircraft are  tobear.   The marks chosen for  private  aircraft in time of peace by    [11463]                  1                             c
States which are parties to the Air Navigation Convention of 1919are set out in that Convention, and are generally known.   It isequally important that the marks for public aircraft, whether military or non-military, should be equally well known, and also the  markschosen for private aircraft possessing the nationality  of  a  State,which is not a party to the said Convention.  Notification to all other powers is, therefore,  provided  for of the marks prescribed by therules  in force in each State.   Necessity may arise for a change in the  marks adopted by each state.  When that happens  the change must be notified.   If thechange is made in time of peace, there can be no difficulty in notifyingit before it is brought into force.   In time of war changes must be notified as soon as possible and ntlatest when tljey are  communicated by the State  concerned to itsown fighting forces.  It will be important to a  State, which changes the marks on its military aircraft in time of war, to notify the changeas quickly as possible to its  own forces, as otherwise  the aircraft might run the risk  of being shot down by their own side.   For thisreason no  anxiety  need be felt that there will be  any attempt to evade compliance with the rule.   Eegret  has been  expressed  in  some  quarters that  any change should be allowed in time of war of the marks adopted by a particularState. The practical  reasons, however, in favour  of  allowing such modifications are overwhelming.   The marks adopted  by  different countries for their military machines are in some cases not very dis-similar, and if war broke out between two countries whose militarymachines  bore  marks which were not readily  distinguishable,  itwould be essential that a modification should be made.                            Article 8.   The external marks,  prescribed  by  the  rules in  force in each state, shall be notified promptly to  all other Powers.   Modifications adopted in time of peace of  the rules prescribingexternal marks shall  be notified to all other Powers before  they are-brought into force.   Modifications of such rules adopted at the outbreak of war or during hostilities shall be notified by each Power as soon as possibleto all other Poioers  and at latest when they are communicated to itxown fighting forces.    Article 9 is founded  upon a proposal first submitted  by theJapanese Delegation;  an American proposal to the  same effect was submitted at a later stage.  The subject of the  article is  one of some difficulty and one which has in times past been  fruitful of discussion?and  disagreements in connection  with warships,  the  Powers not having been  able to agree whether the  act of sovereignty  involvedin the commissioning of a warship might properly  be exercised onthe high seas (see the preamble to Convention  VII  of  1907).   The proposal received the support of a majority of the delegationsonly,  the French Delegation being unable to accept  it.
  1  &apos;  11                     Article 9.         -         , &apos;   ....   A belligerent non-military aircraft, whether public  or  private,may be converted into a military aircraft, provided that  the conver-sion is  effected within the jurisdiction of the belligerent State towhich the aircraft belongs and not on the high seas.   The proposal submitted by the Japanese Delegation would also have  prevented the  conversion of military aircraft into private air-craft except within the jurisdiction of the belligerent State concerned.The majority of the members of the  Commission were of opinionthat an article on this subject was not required.   It does not seem likely that such conversion would be  effected upon the high seasexcept for the purpose of enabling an aircraft, not otherwise entitledto do so, to enter neutral territory.  There would be many practicaldifficulties  in the way  of  any such  conversion :  not only wouldidentity marks have  to be affixed which  would depend on the registra-tion in the  home State, but  a civilian crew would have to be obtained and various certificates would be required, all of which should  bedated.   If the  marks and  papers  belonging to  some other aircraft were used,  the marks and papers would  be false.  A fraud would havebeen practised on the neutral State.   Even if the proceedings were authorised  by the belligerent State concerned, so that it would  bevalid  under its own  law, the marks would still be false marks so faras concerned the neutral State, and if  it became aware of the fraudcommitted, it would  be justified in disregarding the conversion.   Article  10 adopts for time of war a principle which has alreadybeen adopted for private aircraft in time of peace by article .8 of theAir Navigation Convention of 1919.                           Article 10.   No aircraft may possess  more than one nationality.                         CHAPTEE II.                      GENERAL PBINCIPLES.   Article  11  embodies the general principle that  outside the juris-diction of any State, i.e., in the air space over the high seas, all air-craft  have  full freedom of  passage.  Provisions embodied in other articles which  restrict  the  liberty of individual  aircraft  are  to  beregarded as exceptions to this general principle.                           Article 11.   Outside the  jurisdiction of any State,  belligerent or neutral, all aircraft shall  have fidl freedom of passage through the air  and ofalighting.   In  time of peace  many States  are  subject to treaty  obligationsrequiring  them to allow aircraft of o^her States to circulate in  thy     [11463]                                             o 2
air space above their territory.  In time of war a State must possessgreater freedom of action.  Article 12 therefore recognises the liberty of each State to enact sueh rules on this  subject as it may  deem necessary.                           Article 12.   In time of war any State, whether  belligerent or neutral, mayforbid or regulate  the entrance,  movement  or  sojourn of aircraft,within its jurisdiction.              Knmvledge of the Existence of the War.   Among the provisions contained in the original American draft was an article to the following effect:     &quot; The liability of an aircraft for violation of the laws of war iscontingent upon her actual or constructive knowledge of the existenceof the war.&quot;   . The discussions upon this article led the American Delegation towithdraw the proposal.   Knowledge of the existence of a state of war was frequently in thepast an important element in deciding cases instituted in prize courts-for the condemnation of a ship or goods.  Sailing ships were often at sea in old days for months without touching at any port, and under such conditions it was easy for a vessel to be unaware of the  outbreakof war.   The question diminished in importance  when steamshipstended to replace sailing ships, and diminished still more in iniport-ance when wireless telegraphy was invented and fitted to sea-goingships.   With aircraft the case is different;  the velocity of their flight andthe small supplies of fuel which they can carry will render it unusualfor a flight to exceed twelve hours in length.  Cases are therefore not likely to arise in which there can be any doubt of the actual knowledgeof the existence of a  state of war, or in which constructive knowledgehas to be relied on.  Furthermore, all aircraft of important size arelikely to be fitted with a wireless installation.   The Declaration of London, framed  in  1909,  contained provi-sions  on this subject (see articles 43 and 45),  and it was then foundnecessary to deal with the matter in greater detail than is attemptedin the above American proposal.  Until experience shows that it isnecessary to frame a rule oh this subject for aircraft, it seems  moreprudent to leave the matter to rest on the basis of the general rules of international law.   So far as concerns neutral Powers, the Convention on the Openingof Hostilities (No. Ill of 1907) lays down that the existence of a stateof war must be notified to neutral  Powers, and that they are subjectto no  obligations arising therefrom until the receipt of such notifica-tion.  They cannot, however, rely on  the absence of any such noti-fication, if it can be established  that they were actually aware of thaexistence of the state  of war.   This provision seems  adequate and satisfactory.
                         CHAPTER  III,                          BELLIGERENTS.    The  use of privateers in  naval warfare was  abolished  by theDeclaration of Paris, 1856.  Belligerent rights at  sea can now onlybe exercised by units under the direct authority, immediate  controland  responsibility of the State.  This same principle should applyto aerial warfare.   Belligerent rights should therefore only  beexercised by military aircraft.                           Article 13.  Military aircraft are alone entitled to exercise belligerent rights.   Operations of war involve the responsibility of  the State.   Unitsof the fighting forces must, therefore, be under the direct control ofpersons responsible  to the State.   For the same reason  the crewmust be exclusively military in order  that they may be subject to military  discipline.                           Article 14.   A military aircraft shall be  under the command of a person dulycommissioned or enlisted in the military  service  of the State; thacrew must be exclusively military.   Combatant members of the  armed land forces  must, if they arenot in uniform, wear at  least a distinctive emblem.  So long as theofficers or crew of a military aircraft are on board the aircraft there isno risk  of any doubt as to their combatant status, but if  they areforced to land they  may become separated  from the machine.  Inthat event it is necessary for their own protection that their com-combatant status should be easily recognised.                           Article 15.   Members of the crew of a military aircraft shall wear a fixed dis-tinctive emblem of such character as to be  recognisable at a distancein case they become separated  from their  aircraft.   The   next  article  indicates  the  aircraft  which may  engage  in hostilities, and forbids private aircraft from being  armed when theyare outside the jurisdiction of their own country.   The  immunities which a belligerent is bound to respect in  a non-combatant impose upon  the non-combatant  a corresponding obliga-tion not to take part in hostilities.  This principle applies equally toaerial warfare.  If a distinction  is to be drawn between military andother aircraft,  the distinction must be observed on both sides, and,non-military aircraft must not attempt to engage in hostilities in&apos;any form.                          Hi
   To give full effect to this principle, a non-military aircraft mustbe debarred  from transmitting, during flight, military  intelligencefor the benefit of a belligerent.   This rule will be seen to be naturaland logical if the peculiar characteristics of aircraft are borne in mind.It is as scouts and observers that one of their principal uses is foundin time of war.  If non-military aircraft were to be allowed to act inthis  capacity, injury of  very serious consequence  might be done tothe opposing belligerent.   If  exposed to such risk, no  belligerentcould agree to respect the immunities which a non-combatant air-craft should  enjoy, and the only way to ensure such respect is torecognise that the transmission  of military intelligence for the benefitof a belligerent is a participation in hostilities, which would constitute a violation of the laws of war and would be dealt with accordingly.   The rule as framed has been restricted within the narrowest limitscompatible with military  safety.   It is limited to transmission of intelligence during flight.   When the flight has  been completed, theindividual  concerned will  be within the jurisdiction of some State,and  there  the control  of the  transmission of  information will bosubject to the regulations of that State. It will not be affected by theprovisions of this article.   The mounting of arms in time of war may be construed as vrimHfacie evidence of an intention  to take part in hostilities.   It is truethat of recent years certain States found it necessary to arm merchant ships in self-protection, but  the conditions of air  warfare are sodifferent that it has not been thought necessary to allow for such aproceeding on the part of aircraft.   A gun would not be an adequate protection  to an aircraft against illegal attack,  as the first warningthe aircraft might have of any such attack would be an  act whichmight involve its destruction.   On the other hand, to permit private aircraft to be armed would facilitate acts of perfidy on the  part of an opposing belligerent; an aircraft masquerading under false marks might suddenly open fire,and  the risk  of this would be sufficient to render it dangerous for anhonest belligerent to respect the immunities of private aircraft to theextent which he would wish.   The interests  of private aircraft  are from  every point of viewbetter served by the adoption of a rule against the arming of privateaircraft in time of war.   The article as framed does not extend to aircraft within the juris-diction of their own State.  Such an extension would be an unreason-able  interference  with  the   domestic  jurisdiction of  the  state concerned.   The rule  against aircraft being  armed is limited to private air-craft.   Public non-military aircraft engaged in customs or policework may  find it necessary to  carry arms because the fulfilment oftheir functions renders it essential for  them to  be able  to applycoercion in case of need.  In their case,  the  carriage of arms would raise no presumption of an intention to take part in hostilities, butthey are subject just as  much as private aircraft to the provisions ofthe first two  paragraphs of the article.
   -                      i  Article 16. - . .   ;   No aircraft other than a belligerent military aircraft shall engage in hostilities in any form.   The term &quot;hostilities&quot; includes the transmission during flightof military intelligence for the immediate use of a belligerent.   No private  aircraft,  when outside  the  jurisdiction  of  its own country, shall be armed in time of war.   The provisions of the Geneva Convention have been applied tomaritime warfare by the  Convention signed at The Hague  in 1907(Convention X of 1907).  It will probably be found desirable to extendthem in  due  course to warfare in the air and to negotiate a specialconvention for this purpose.    Pending the conclusion of any suchconvention, a rule has been adopted stating broadly that these con-ventions apply to aerial warfare.  Flying ambulances should  enjoy the privileges and immunities conferred by the Geneva Conventionupon mobile  medical units or sanitary formations.   The  work ofsuch flying ambulances must,  of  course,  be carried  out subject to similar conditions of belligerent  control as  those laid down in  thoConventions  of 1906 and  1907,  and they must devote  themselvesto the task of succouring all wounded impartially in accordance withthe principles embodied  in  these  Conventions.    When the.newspecial convention referred to above, is concluded, the opportunitywill no doubt be  taken to extend to flying ambulances the exemption from  dues already  conferred by treaty upon hospital ships whichenter a foreign port.                           Article 17.   The principles laid down in the  Geneva Convention, 1906, andthe Convention for the adaptation of the said Convention to MaritimeWar (No.  X of  1907) shall  apply to aerial warfare and to flyingambidances, as well as to the control over flying ambulances exercised by a belligerent commanding officer.   In order to enjoy the protection and privileges allowed to mobilemedical units by the Geneva Convention, 1906, flying ambulancesmust, bear the distinctive emblem of the  Red Cross in addition to  thousual distinguishing marks.                         CHAPTER. IV.                          HOSTILITIES.   Article  18 is intended to clear up a doubt which arose  during  therecent war. The use of tracer bullets against aircraft was a  general practice in all the contending armies.   In the  absence of a hardsurface on which the bullet will strike, an airman cannot tell whetheror not his aim is correct.   These bullets were used for the purpose of enabling the airman to correct his aim,  as the trail of vapour whichthey leave behind indicates to him.the exact line of fire.   In one case, however, combatant airmen were arrested and put on  trial on
the ground that the use of these bullets constituted a breach of thoexisting rules of war laid down by treaty.    The use of incendiary bullets is also  necessary as a means of attack against lighter-than-air craft, as it. is by setting fire to the gascontained by these aircraft that they can most easily be destroyed.    In the form in which the proposal was first brought forward its provisions were limited to a stipulation that the use of tracer bulletsagainst aircraft generally was not prohibited.    Various criticisms were, however, made about the proposed text,chiefly founded on the impracticability for an airman while in flightto change the ammunition which he is using in the machine gun inhis aircraft.  He cannot employ different bullets in accordance withthe target at which  he is aiming, one sort of ammunition for other aircraft  and another, sort  for  land forces by  whom he may be attacked.    The Commission, therefore, came to the conclusion that the most satisfactory solution of the problem would be to state specifically thatthe use of tracer, incendiary or explosive  projectiles by  or againstaircraft is not prohibited.                           Article  18.  .  The use of tracer, incendiary on explosive projectiles by or againstaircraft is not prohibited.    This provision applies equally to  States which are parties  to theDeclaration of  St. Petersburg, 18C8, and to those which are not.    In order that there may be no doubt that the use of false externalmarks is not  a legitimate ruse it has been specifically prohibitedBy later provisions  in the rules, the use of false external marks ismade a ground for capture and condemnation of a neutral aircraft.    What are  here  referred to are  false  marks of  nationality orcharacter, the marks which are dealt with in Chapter I of these rules.The article would  not  apply  to mere  squadron  badges or otheremblems which are only of  interest to  one particular  belligerentforce.                           Article  19.    The use of false external marks is forbidden.  ...  Another mode of injuring the enemy,  which it has seemed desir-able to  prohibit, is that of firing at airmen escaping from a disabledaircraft.                           Article  20.    When an  aircraft has  been  disabled,  the  occupants,  whenendeavouring  to escape  by means  of a  parachute, must  not be attacked in the course  of their descent.    Incidents took place in the recent war which showed the desira-bility of having a distinct rule on the question whether the dropping of leaflets for propaganda purposes was a legitimate means of warfare,
Attempts&apos;were made by-one belligerent to impose lieaVy penalties onairmen who were forced to descend within his1 lines after engaging inthis work.   Article 21 has been framed to meet&apos;this case.  It is not limited todropping leaflets,  as  aircraft can disseminate  propaganda by  other means, such for instance, as emitting trails of  smoke in the  form of words in the sky.   What is legalised by the article  is the use of  aircraft for distri-bnting propaganda.   It does not follow that propaganda of all  kindsis thereby validated.   Incitements to murder  or assassination will,for instance, still be considered illegitimate forms of propaganda.                           Article  21.   The use of aircraft for the purpose of disseminating propagandashall not he  treated as an illegitimate means of warfare.   Members of the crews of such aircraftmust not be deprived oftheir rights as  prisoners of  roar on the charge that  they  have com-initted such an act.                         Bombardment.  -   The subject of bombardment by aircraft is one of the most  difficultto deal with in framing any  code of rules for aerial warfare.   The experiences of the recent war have left in the mind of theworld at large a lively horror of the  havoc which can be wrought bythe indiscriminate launching of bombs and  projectiles on the non-combatant populations of towns and cities.  The conscience of man-kind revolts against this form  of making war  in places outside theactual  theatre  of  military operations, and the feeling is universalthat limitations must be imposed.   On the other hand, it is  equally clear that the aircraft  is a potentengine of war, and no State  which realises the possibility that it mayitself be  attacked, and the  use  to which  its  adversary may  put  hisair forces can take the risk of fettering its own liberty of action to an extent  which would restrict it from  attacking its enemy where thatadversary may legitimately be  attacked with effect.  It  is useless,therefore, to enact prohibitions unless there is an equally clear under-standing of what constitute legitimate objects  of attack, and it isprecisely in  this respect that agreement was difficult to reach.   Before passing to  a consideration of the articles which have beenagreed, mention must be made of the Declaration prohibiting theDischarge of Projectiles  and Explosives from  Balloons,  signed atThe Hague  in 1907.  Three of  the States represented on the  Com-mission* are parties  to that Declaration; the other three are.not.Under the terms  of this Declaration the Contracting Powers  agreeto prohibit the  discharge  of projectiles and explosives from balloonsor by other neio methods of a similar nature.  Its terms  are, there-fore, wide enough to  cover bombardment by aircraft. . On the  otherhand, the scope of the Declaration is very limited;  in duration it is.     * United States of America, Great Britain and The Netherlands.                  *
to last only until the close  of the. Third Peace Conference, a con-conferenee which was to have been summoned for 1914 or 1915, and its application is confined to a war between contracting States withoutthe participation of  a non-contracting State.   The existence, of this Declaration can afford no solution of theproblems arising out of the  question of bombardment  from the air,even for the States which are. parties to it.   The number of  parties is so small that, even if the Declarationwere renewed, no confidence could ever be felt that when a war broke out it would apply.   A general agreement,  therefore, on the subjectof bombardment from the air is much to be desired.  For the states which  are parties to it, however, the  Declaration exists and it is well that the legal situation should be clearly understood.   As  between the parties it will continue in force and will operate inthe event of a war  between them, unless by mutual agreement its terms  are modified, or an understanding reached  that it shall beregarded as replaced by some new conventional stipulation;  but itwill in any case cease to operate at the moment when a Third PeaceConference concludes its labours, or if any State which is not a partyto the  Declaration intervenes in the war as a belligerent.   No difficulty was found in reaching an agreement that there arecertain purposes for which aerial bombardment  is inadmissible.   Article 22 has been formulated with this object.                           Article 22.   Aerial bombardment for the purpose of terrorising the civilian population,. of destroying  or  damaging  private  property not  ofmilitary character, or of injuring non-combatants is prohibited.   The Naval  Bombardment  Convention of 1907  (No. IX) allowsbombardment for  enforcing payment of requisitions  for suppliesnecessary for the immediate use of the naVal forces (article 3),  butnot for enforcing payment of money contributions (article 4).   For aerial warfare it has been decided to adopt the more stringentrule of the Land Warfare Regulations. ;       :  ,         -       Article 23.   Aerial bombardment for the purpose of enforcing compliance withrequisitions in  kind or payment  of contributions in  money  is prohibited.                          -   Agreement on the following article specifying the objects whichmay legitimately be bombarded from  the air was not reached withoutprolonged discussion.  Numerous proposals were put forward by thevarious delegations before unanimity was ultimately attained.  the text of these proposals will be found  in the minutes.  In,particular,mention  may be made  of an Italian proposal of the 8th February,on which the text  ultimately adopted was in great part founded.Regret was expressed by some delegations that a more far-reachingprohibition did-not. meet with, unanimous acceptance.,  .,-  ;
    The terms of the article are so clear that  no explanation of the provisions is necessary, but it may be well to state that in the phrase in  paragraph  2 &quot;military establishments or  depots&quot;  the word &apos;&apos; depots &apos;&apos; is intended to cover all collections of supplies for military use which have passed into the possession of the military authorities and are ready for  delivery to  the forces,  &quot;distinctively military- supplies &quot; in the succeeding phrase is intended to cover those which by  their  nature show that they are certainly manufactured for military purposes.    If the code of rules of aerial warfare should eventually be annexed to a convention, paragraph 5 of the article would find a more appro- priate place in the convention.    It will be noticed that for aerial bombardment the  test adopted in article 25 of the Land Warfare Regulations, that of the town, &amp;c, being defended, is abandoned.  The nature of the objective or the use to which it is being put now becomes the test.                            Article 24.    1. Aerial  bombardment  is legitimate only when directed  at  a military objective, that is to say, an object of which  the destruction. or  injury  would constitute  a distinct  military  advantage to  the belligerent.    2. Such bombardment is legitimate only when directed exclusively at the follmoing objectives : military forces; military ivorks; military establishments or depots; factories constituting important and well- known centres engaged in the manufacture of  arms,  ammunition or distinctively military supplies;  lines of communication or transporta- tion used  for military purposes.    3. The  bombardment  of cities,  toions, villages,  dwellings  or buildings  not in the immediate neighbourhood of the operations of land forces is prohibited.  In cases ivhere the objectives specified in paragraph % are so  situated that they  cannot be bombarded without the indiscriminate bombardment of the civilian population, the air- craft must abstain from bombardment.               ......    4. In  the immediate  neighbourhood  of the operations of land jorces, the bombardment  of cities,  towns, villages,  dioellings  or buildings  is legitimate provided  that there exists a.reasonable  pre- sumption  that the  military  concentration is  sufficiently important to justify such bombardment, having regard to the danger thus caused to the civilian population.                              ,  .   .  i.    5. A  belligerent  State is liable to pay compensation for injilries to person  or to property caused by the  violation by any of its officers or forces of the provisions of this article.  ...  ,    Both in land warfare and in maritime warfare the. -principle hasbeen adopted that certain special classes of buildings must be sparedso  far as  possible  in case of bombardment;  for the  former,  by article 27 of the Land Warfare Regulations, for the latter.by article 5of the Naval Bombardment Convention of^.907 (No. IX). A similar provision, largely based on that in the  Naval Bombardment  Conven-
tioh,  has been adopted  as  article 25.    By  day,  these  privilegedbuildings must be marked in a way which will make them visible to aircraft; the marks agreed on being those laid down in the geneva convention and in the Naval Bombardment Convention;  the use ofsuch  marks is made  obligatory  so as to  correspond with the dutyplaced on the  adversary of sparing such buildings.  By night, how.ever,  the use of lights to make the special signs visible is optional,because experience has shown that such lights may serve as guides tonight-flying aircraft and may thereby be of service to the enemy.                           Article 25.   In bombardment by aircraft,  all necessary steps must. be takenby the commander to spare as far as possible  buildings dedicated to public worship, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monu-ments, hospital sliips, hospitals and  other places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided such buildings, objects or places arenot at the time used for military  purposes.  Such buildings, objectsand places must  by  day be  indicated by marks visible to aircraft.The use  of marks to indicate other buildings,  objects or places thanthose specified above is to be deemed an act of perfidy.  The marksused as aforesaid shall be in the case  of buildings protected under the geneva Convention the red cross  on  a white ground, and in the caseof other protected buildings a, large rectangular panel divided diagon-ally into two pointed triangular  portions, one black and the otherwhite.   A  belligerent who desires to secure by night the protection forthe hospitals and other privileged buildings above mentioned must take the necessary measures to render the special  signs referred tosufficiently visible.   A  proposal was submitted by  the Italian Delegation for the pur-pose  of  securing better protection  from aerial bombardment forimportant historic monuments.   During the recent war it was not found that the articles in  the Land Warfare Regulations and  theNaval Bombardment  Convention were sufficient to prevent historicmonuments from being bombarded.  An unscrupulous  opponent canalways allege  that they  are being used for  military purposes andignore the written agreements accordingly.  There  is also the possi-bilit^ that in the attack on some object which  is a legitimate subject for. bombardment, a historic monument in the immediate  vicinitymay be injured.   The Italian proposal comprised two new features, the creation of  a-zone  round each historic monument within which  the State was tobe debarred from committing any act which constituted a  use of thearea for military purposes,  and a system of inspection under neutralauspices to ensure that  the undertaking was carried  out,  both asregards the monument itself and the zone.    By this means anypretext for the bombardment would be removed,  and the risk ofunintentional injury would be minimised.
                               &apos;2!l   The proposal  received the, sympathetic consideration  oi. all the-Delegations and it was accordingly remitted to an expert committee-for more detailed consideration.  Article 26 has been prepared in thelight of their report.   The Italian proposal comprised not only historic but also artisticmonuments.  It has  seemed better to omit the word &quot;artistic&quot; for fear lest a divergence should appear to be created between the newarticle and article 25, the language of which is modelled on article 27of the Land Warfare  Regulations and article 5 of the Naval Bombard-ment  Convention (No. IX  of  1907).   The words &quot;historic  monn-ment &quot; in this article are used in a broad sense.   They cover all.monuments which by reason of their great artistic value are historic.to-day or will become historic in the future.   It  should be clearly understood that adoption of the system is onlypermissive.  If a State  prefers to trust only  to article 25 to  secureprotection of its monuments,  there is no obligation upon it to notifythem to other Powers in peace time and to establish the surroundingzones  which are not to be used for military purposes.   The notification must be made through the diplomatic channel..It will then be open to any State receiving the notification, if it thinks.it necessary to do so, to question within a reasonable time the proprietyof regarding a particular place  as  an historic monument.    If no-question  is raised with  regard  to  the monuments notified,  other states will be  regarded as having accepted the demand for the pro-tection of such monuments from bombardment,  and  the  immunitywill then rest on the basis  of agreement. ..For the same reason the notification once made must not be withdrawn after the outbreak ofhostilities.   Considerable hesitation  was expressed in accepting the provision.that notification must be made in time of peace.  It was urged thatthe  system proposed was a new procedure,  that particular  rnonu-ments might be forgotten, and that more elasticity should be allowed.On the other hand, it was urged that the essence  of the scheme was-to get agreement as to the  immunity of these  monuments, and that unless-notification in time of war was excluded, it  was  not likely thatany would be notified in time  of peace.   The effect of allowing a 500-metre  zone to be  drawn round eachmonument may well  be that in certain special eases, as, for instance,A&apos;enice or Florence, which  are  particularly  rich in ancient andhistoric monuments, a large portion of the city would be comprisedwithin the protected zones.  The zones round each monument willoverlap and so create a continuous area.  The  subsequent provisionswill, however, ensure that there is a  complete absence of militaryuse of any portion of the area so protected.   It  was agreed that if the belligerents did not for military reasonsplace the signs indicated in the article, enemy aviators had no rightby reason merely of  their absence to bombard the zone in question,if it had been duly determined and notified.   In  their report, the exparts stated that  they considered that themarks designed to indicate the zones of protection round monumentsshould differ  in design from  those  prescribed by article  25  for th.v
historic monuments themselves.  The Commission took note of thisrecommendation.   The prohibition against the  use of the zone  surrounding  themonument must be very strictly interpreted.  There must be a com-plete cessation of the  use  of any  place, including,  for  instance,factories and railway lines, with a military purpose in view.   The special committee of inspection provided  for by the articlewill  be  constituted by the  State  which has taken advantage of thearticle.   There would not seem to be any need to establish the com-mittee until the outbreak of war.  As these special  arrangements willhave to be  made in order to  secure full protection for its historicmonuments, the State will be  bound to afford to this committee th,&apos;)fullest opportunity for  making the  investigations they may think necessary.                           Article 26.   The following special rules are adopted for the purpose of enablingStates to obtain more efficient protection for impoitant historic monu-merits situated within their territory, provided that they are willingto refrain from the use  of such monuments and a  surrounding zone,for  military purposes,  and to accept a  special  r&amp;gime  for theirinspection:    1. A State shall be  entitled, if it sees fit, to establish a zone of          protection round such monuments situated in its  territory.          Such zones shall in time of war enjoy immunity from          bombardment.   2. The monuments round which  a zone is to be established shall          be notified  to other Powers in peace time through  the          diplomatic channel; the notification shall also indicate the          limits of the  zones.    The notification may not be ivith-          draion in time of tear.   8. The  zone of protection  may include, in addition to the area          actually occupied by the monument or group of monuments,          an  outer  zone,  not exceeding  500 metres in  width,          measured from the circumference of the said area.   4. Marks clearly visible from aircraft either by day or by night          will be employed for the purpose of ensuring the identification-          tion by belligerent airmen of the limits of the zones.   5. The marks on the monuments  themselves will be those defined          in article 25.  The marks employed for indicating the sur-          rounding zones will  be fixed by each State adopting  th0.         provisions of this article,  and will  be  notified  to other          Powers at the same time as the monuments and zones are         notified.   6. Any abusive use of the marks  indicating  the zones referred to         in paragraph 5 wiU be regarded as an act of perfidy.   7. A  State  adopting the provisions  of this article must abstain         from using  the monument and the surrounding  zone for         military purposes, or for the benefit in any way whatever          of its military organisation,  or from committing  within
81807          such monument or zone any act with a military purpose in          view.   8. An inspection committee  consisting of three neutral repre-          sentatives accredited to the State adopting the provisions          of this article, or their delegates, shall be appointed for the          purpose of ensuring that no violation is committed of the          provisions  of paragraph 7.  One of the members of the          committee of inspection shall be the representative (or his          delegate)  of the State to  which has been  entrusted the          interests of the opposing belligerent.                           Espionage.   The articles dealing with espionage follow closely the precedent of the Land Warfare Regulations.   Article 27 is a verbal adaptation of the first paragraph of article 29of the Regulations, so phrased as to limit it to acts committed while in the air.   Consideration has been given to the question whether there was any need to add to the provision instances of actions which were notto be deemed acts of espionage, such  as those  which are  given at theend of  article  29 in the  Regulations, and it  was suggested that article 29* of the American draft might appropriately be introduced in this manner.   It was decided that this was unnecessary.   Thearticle submitted by the American Delegation was intended to ensurethat reconnaissance work  openly  done behind  the enemy lines by aircraft should not be treated as spying.  It is not thought  likely that any belligerent would attempt to treat it as such.                           Article  27.                    ft   Any  person on board a belligerent or neutral aircraft is  to bedeemed a spy only if acting clandestinely  or on false pretences heobtains or seeks to obtain,  while in the  air, information within belli--gerent jurisdiction or in the zone of operations of a belligerent withthe intention of communicating it to the hostile party.   Acts of espionage by members of the crew  of an  aircraft  or by persons who have been carried in an  aircraft may well be committedafter they have left the  aircraft.  They will in  that case be subjectto the Land Warfare Regulations.                           Article  28.   Acts of  espionage  committed  after  leaving  the  aircraft bymembers of the cretv of an aircraft or by passengers transported by it are subject to the provisions of the Land Warfare Regidations.   Two  rules have  been adopted in land  warfare with respect toespionage which should apply equally to  aerial  warfare.   These are   * Acts of  the personnel of correctly marked enemy aircraft, public or private, done or performed while in the air, are not to bo deemed espionage.
that.a spy  cannot be punished  without previous  trial, and that a-member of  an army who commits an act of espionage and succeedsin rejoining the army cannot, if he is subsequently captured, bemade responsible for the previous act of espionage.   He is entitledto be treated as a prisoner of war.                            Article 29.   Punishment of the acts of espionage referred to in articles 27 arid28 is subject to articles 30 and 81 of the Land Warfare Regulations.                          CHAPTER  V.  MILITARY AUTHORITY OVER ENEMY AND NEOTRAL AIRCRAFT AND                       PERSONS ON  BOARD.   The rapidity of its flight would enable  an aircraft to embarrass the operations of land  or sea forces, or even operations in the air, toan extent which might prove most inconvenient or even disastrous to a  belligerent commander.  To protect belligerents from  improperintrusions of this kind, it is necessary to authorise belligerent com-manders to warn off the intruders, and, if the warning is disregarded.to compel their retirement by opening fire.   It is easyr to see that undue hardship might  be occasioned bneutrals if advantage were taken of the faculty so conferred on belli-gerent commanding officers and  attempts were made  to exclude forlong or indefinite periods all neutrals from  stipulated areas or toprevent communication between different countries through the airover the high seas.  The present  provision only authorises a com-manding  officer  to  warn off aircraft  during the duration  of  theoperations in which he is engaged at the time.  The right of neutralaircraft to circulate in the airspace over  the high seas is emphasisedby the provisions of article 11,  which provides that &quot;outside  thejurisdiction  of any State, belligerent or neutral, all aircraft shall havnfull freedom of passage through the air and of alighting.&quot;   Article 80 is confined in terms to neutral aircraft,  because enemy aircraft are  in any event exposed to  the risk  of capture, and in thevicinity of military operations are subjected  to more drastic treat-ment than that provided by this article.   It will  be noticed  that  the terms of the  article  are  general in character and would  comprise even  neutral public or military air-craft.   It goes without saying that the article is not intended to imply any  encroachment on the rights  of neutral States.   It is assumed that no neutral  public or military aircraft would depart sowidely from the practice of  States as to attempt to interfere with orintrude upon the operations of a belligerent  State.                           Article 30.   In  case  a  belligerent commanding  officer considers  that  thepresence of aircraft is likely to prejudice the  success of the operations
m which lie is engaged at the moment, he may prohibit the passingoj neutral  aircraft  in  the  immediate vicinity  of his forces  or mayoblige them to follow  a particular route.  A neutral aircraft whichdoes not conform to such directions,- of which he has had notice issuedby the belligerent commanding officer, may be fired upon.   The power to requisition aircraft in occupied enemy territory is recognised  in article 53 of the Land Warfare Eegulations.  The text of article 58 is not specific as to whether it includes neutral property,and though in practice it is regarded as doing so, it has been thoughtwell to adopt a special rule in harmony with article 53.   It is not unreasonable that neutral owners of property should receive payment for their property at once,  as they are not concerned with the peacewhich will  be ultimately concluded.                           Article  31.   In accordance with the principles of article 53 of the Land War-fare Regulations, neutral private aircraft found upon  entry  in theenemy&apos;s jurisdiction by a belligerent occupying force may be requi-sitioned, subject to the payment  of fidl compensation. .   Property of the enemy State, which may be used for operations of war, is always liable to confiscation if it falls into the hands of the opposing belligerent.  It is  natural, therefore, that public  aircraft of the enemy should be so treated.   Article  17 will create  an exception in favour of flying ambulancesas they will  be protected  by article 6 of the  Geneva Convention,but this exception will  be  subject to the principle  laid down  inarticle 7 of the same Convention that the protection  accorded tomobile medical units ceases  if they  are made use of to commit actsharmful  to the  enemy.                            Article  32.   Enemy public aircraft, other than  those  treated on  the same footing  as  private aircraft, shall he subject to confiscation icithouiprize proceedings.   Non-military aircraft of  belligerent nationality, whether public or private, should not in general be exposed  to the risk of instantdestruction, but should be given the opportunity  to land.   If theyare flying in the jurisdiction of  their own State and enemy military aircraft approach, they should, for  their own protection,  make the nearest available landing.   Failure to do so exposes them to therisk of being fired upon.                            Article  33.    Belligerent  non-military  aircraft,  whether public  or private,flying  within the  jurisdiction of their own State,  are liable  to  befired  upon unless they  make  the nearest  available  landing  onthe approach  of enemy military aircraft.     [11463]   .       &apos;             *                     D
 &apos;  The preceding article has dealt with the case of belligerent, non-military aircraft flying in the jurisdiction of  their  own State.Article  34 deals with the same  category of aircraft in certain other circumstances.   If such aircraft are in the immediate vicinity ofthe territory of the enemy State, or in the immediate vicinity of its military operations by land or sea, they run the  risk of being  firedupon.   They  are,  of course, liable  to capture by reason  of  theirenemy  status, but in an  area where  it  is probable that  militaryoperations  will  be in progress, or  in  any  place  where they.are actually in progress, non-combatant  aircraft of belligerent  nationa-lity can only  proceed at their  own  risk.   By their mere presencethey expose themselves to the  risk of being fired  upon.                           Article 34.   Belligerent non-military aircraft,  whether public or private, areliable to be  fired upon, if they fly,(A) within the  jurisdiction of theenemy, or (2) in the immediate vicinity thereof  and outside thejurisdiction  of their own State, or (3)  in  the immediate vicinity ofthe military operations of the enemy  by land or sea.   The principle has already  been recognised in article 30 that abelligerent commanding officer may warn off neutral aircraft from theimmediate vicinity of his military operations.  If they fail to complywith such a warning, they run the risk of being fired upon.  Article 35deals with neutral aircraft which  may be  flying within  the  jurisdic-tion of a belligerent country  at  a moment when  military aircraft of the opposing belligerent approach.  If warned  of the approach ofsuch military  aircraft, it is their duty to make a landing; otherwisethey might  hamper the movements  of the combatants and exposethemselves to the risk of being  fired  upon.  They are not, however.exposed to the risk of capture  and condemnation  as are neutral air-craft failing to comply with directions issued by  a belligerent  com-mander under article 30.                           Article 35.    Neutral aircraft flying within the jurisdiction of a belligerent, andwarned of the approach of military  aircraft of the opposing  belli-gerent, must  make the nearest available landing.  Failure  to  do soexposes them to the risk oj being fired upon.    Article 36 regulates the position  of members  of the crew and of passengers  of an enemy aircraft  which  falls into the  hands  of abelligerent.    If  the aircraft is a military  aircraft,  the  crew  will consist ofmembers of the military forces and will, of course, be made prisonersof war.  Any  passengers will share the same fate, because in time ofwar a belligerent State would not be using its military aircraft forcarrying  non-combatant  individuals unless  their journey was amatter of importance to the  State.    Combatant passengers  would naturally be made prisoners of  war.
   In1 the  case  of public non-military  aircraft, the same principleapplies.  It is true that the members of the crew may not be membersof the military forces, but they constitute part of the State organisa-tion.  As to passengers, they would not be carried  on such aircraft,except for Government purposes.  There is, however, one importantexception.  A State-owned passenger-carrying aircraft line is not bvany means an unlikely development and, if such should be instituted.there would be no reason to apply this principle to all the passengerson such aircraft. They should only be made prisoners of war if inthe service of the enemy, or enemy nationals fit for military service.   As regards private aircraft, it must be remembered that the crewwill consist of trained men, ^constituting a reserve upon which th?belligerent can  draw in case  of need.   If they are  of  enemynationality, or in the service of the enemy, there is good reason tohold them as prisoners of war.  If they are neutrals not in the serviceof the enemy, they are  by their service  on board an enemy aircraftreleasing other men for military purposes.  If they are to be given their  release, the belligerent should  be entitled  to protect himself in the future against such indirect assistance by exacting an under-taking from each individual against his serving in an enemy aircraft during the remainder of the war.  Such an undertaking corresponds to that provided for in the second paragraph of article 5 of the Con-vention concerning  restrictions on the right of capture  in maritimewar (No. XI of 1907).  It was adopted there only for the officers of a merchant vessel, because the officers are the highly trained men.In the case of aircraft, it is reasonable to extend it to all the membersof the crew.                                              ?   What is said  in the report on article 37 dealing with the crew and passengers of neutral  private  aircraft  as  to  temporary delay, ineffecting the release in certain eases and as to members of the crewor passengers who have rendered special services to the belligerentbeing made prisoners of war, applies also in the case of the crew and passengers of an enemy aircraft.                           Article 36.   .   When an enemy military aircraft  falls into the  hands of  a belli-gerent, the members of the crew and the passengers, if any, may bemade prisoners of war.   The same rule  applies  to  the members  of the  crew and  the passengers, if any,  of an  enemy public  non-military aircraft, exceptthat  in the case of public non-military aircraft  devoted exclusively to the transport  of passengers,  the passengers will  be entitled to be released unless they are in the service of the enemy, or are enemynationals fit for  military service.   If an enemy private aircraft- falls  into the  hand of a belligerent,members of the crew who are  enemy nationals  or  who  are neutralnationals in the service of the enemy,  may be made  prisoners  of war.Neutral members of,the crew, who are not in the service of the enemy,are entitled to be released if  they sign a i&amp;ritten undertaking not &apos;oserve in  any  enemy aircraft  while hostilities last.    Passengers an     [11463]                                            n -2
entitled to be released unless they are in the service of the enemy or are enemy nationals fit for military service,  in which cases they maybe made prisoners of war.   Release may in any case  be delayed if the military interests of the belligerent so require.    The belligerent may hold as prisoners of war any member of the crew or any passenger whose service in a flight at the close of whichhe lias been captured has  been of special and active assistance to theenemy.  .  The names of individuals released after giving a written under-taking in accordance  with the third paragraph of this article will be notified to the opposing belligerent, who must not knowingly employthem in violation of their undertaking.    When circumstances have arisen which  have led to the detention of a neutral private aircraft by a belligerent, the question will ariseof the treatment to be meted out to the crew and to the passengers.if any,  of such aircraft.   In general, the crew of an aircraft will bevery expert individuals, whose services would be of great value to abelligerent.  If they are of  enemy nationality or in the service of theenemy, or engaged in a violation of neutrality, there is good reasonfor detaining them as prisoners of war.    If not, they  should be released unconditionally.    Passengers who are in the service of the enemy or who are enemynationals fit for military service may likewise be detained.    Immediate release of persons who  cannot be made  prisoners ofwar may not in all cases be feasible.  The fact that military exigenciesmay  necessitate  a temporary delay in according release does  not prejudice the  right to such  release in due course.    The peculiar characteristics of aircraft may enable  members ofthe crew or passengers  in a neutral aircraft in time of war to renderservices of special importance to a belligerent.  Where such services have been rendered in the course of the flight in which such persons were captured, the individuals may be made prisoners of war, what-ever  their  nationality.    The rules  adopted  on  this subject  are in conformity with thepractice of the recent  war, but they have not secured unanimousassent.  The  Netherlands Delegation has felt unable to accept themfor two reasons, viz., firstly, that they constitute an extension of the accepted rules of international law, and,  secondly, because of theabsence of any provision  to the effect that where the detention of theaircraft has taken place in circumstances which. are subsequentlymade the subject of prize court proceedings, and the capture is held to be invalid, the crew  and passengers  of the aircraft should be released unconditionally.                            Article 37.    Members  of the crew of  a neutral aircraft which has been detained by a belligerent shall be released unconditionally, if they are neutral nationals and not in the service of the enemy.  If they are enemy
nationals or in the service of the enemy, they may be made prisonersof icar.   Passengers  are  entitled to be released  unless  they  are  in  theservice of the enemy or are enemy nationals fit for military service,in which cases they  may be made prisoners of war.   Release may in any case be delayed&apos;if the military interests of the belligerent so require.   The belligerent may hold as prisoners of war any member of the crew or any passenger tohose service in a flight at the close of whichhe has been captured has been of special and active assistance to theenemy.   The phrase &quot;prisoner of war&quot; in its narrower sense is appliedto the combatant and non-combatant members of the armed forcesof the belligerent (see article 3  of the Land Warfare  Regulations).It is used in articles 86 and 37 in a  broader sense and is applied topassengers or members of the crew of neutral and enemy aircraftwho may not be members of the belligerent  armed forces at all.  Toavoid any risk  of doubt as to the treatment to which such persons are entitled article  38 lays  down that their treatment shall  not beless favourable than that to which members of the armed forces areentitled.                           Article 88.   Where under the provisions  of articles  36 and 37 it  is  providedthat  members of the crew  or passengers may be  made prisoners ofwar, it is to be understood that, if they are not members of the armed forces, they shall be entitled to treatment not less favourable thanthat accorded to prisoners of war.&apos;   &apos;      -                CHAPTER  VI.  BELLIGERENT DUTIES TOWARDS NEUTRAL STATES AND NEUTRAL             DUTIES TOWARDS BELLIGERENT STATES.    To avoid  any suggestion that it is on  the neutral Government;alone that the obligation  is  incumbent to secure  respect for itsneutrality,  srticle 39  provides that belligerent aircraft are underobligation to respect the rights of neutral Powers and to abstain fromacts within neutral  jurisdiction which it is the neutrals  duty toprevent.    It will be noticed that the article is not limited to military aircraft;in fact, the second phrase  will apply only  to belligerent aircraft ofother categories,  as  it is they alone  which may remain  at libertywithin neutral jurisdiction.   All aircraft, however, including military,are bound to  respect the rights of neutral Powers.                           Article 89.    Belligerent aircraft are bound  to respect  the  rights of neutralPowers and to abstain within the jurisdiction of a neutral State from
-$He commission of any act which  it is the duty  of  that State toprevent.    The  principle  -that belligerent  military aircraft  should  not beallowed  to enter or circulate in neutral jurisdiction met with readyacceptance.    It  is in  conformity with  the  rule  adopted  by theEuropean States during the recent war.    The immunities and privileges which article-17  confers on flyingambulances will enable the neutral  State to admit them to its juris-diction,  if it sees fit.                            Article 40.    Belligerent military aircraft are forbidden to enter the jurisdiction of a neutral State.    The customary rules of international law authorise  the admissionof belligerent warships to neutral ports  and waters.   There is no obligation upon neutral States to admit warships belonging to belli-gerent States, but it is not  in general refused.   The admission of belligerent military aircraft, however, is prohibited&apos; by article 40,and account must therefore be taken of the fact that it has now become the practice for warships to have a certain number of aircraft assigned to them and that  these aircraft usually rest on board the warship.While they remain on board the  warship they form part of it, andshould be regarded as such from the point of view of the regulationsissued by the neutral  States.    They will  therefore  be allowed toenter the neutral jurisdiction on the same footing as the warship onboard which they  rest, but they must remain on board the warshipand must not commit any  act which the warship is not allowed to commit.                            Article 41.    Aircraft on board  vessels of war, including aircraft-carriers, shallbe regarded as part of such vessels.    The principle is well established in land warfare that combatantforces of a belligerent must not penetrate within neutral jurisdiction.If they do, they are beyond the  reach of their  enemy: they have entered what is to them an  asylum, and consequently, if after theirvisit to  neutral territory they were allowed to re-enter hostilities,they would be making use  of neutral  territory  to  the detriment oftheir adversary.                                          -  -    From this principle arises  a  duty, which  is incumbent on allneutral States, to  do what they can to prevent combatant forces from entering their jurisdiction,  and to  intern those which do.    these principles are recognised and adopted for aerial warfare by article42.  The obligation to intern covers also aircraft which were withinthe neutral  jurisdiction at the outbreak of hostilities.    Where  aircraft and their personnel  are  in distress  and  seekshelter in neutral territory, knowing that their fate will be intern-nrwnt, or where the entry is due to the fact that the aircraft has lost
its bearings or experienced engine trouble or run out of&quot; fuel, thsneutral State is under no obligation to exclude them; it is, in fact,morally bound to admit them.    This is  due to  the principle  thatthose who are in distress must be succoured.  The prohibition in thearticle is aimed at those who enter in violation of the rights of theneutral State,   The prohibition on entry into neutral jurisdiction leads naturallyto the further obligation incumbent upon  neutral  States to  enforcecompliance with the rule.   It is beyond  the power of any  neutralState to ensure that no belligerent military aircraft will ever violateits neutrality; its  obligation  is  limited to the employment  of themeans at its disposal,  conforming in this respect to the phraseologyemployed in the  Convention dealing with  the Bights and Duties  of neutral Powers in Maritime War (No.  XIII of 1907).   The provision in the article is limited to military aircraft because it is only in respect of such craft that the prohibition on entry isabsolute.  Under article 12 the admission  of  private or public non-military aircraft is within the discretion of the neutral State.  where such aircraft penetrate within neutral jurisdiction  in violation of themeasures prescribed by the neutral Tower, they  will be subject  tosuch penalties as the neutral Power may enact;  these may or maynot include internment.  Recognition  of this fact has enabled theCommission  to omit a provision which figured as article  11  in theAmerican draft:        &apos;&apos; A neutral Government may intern any aircraft of belligerent   nationality not conforming to&apos;its regulations.&quot;   The obligation on the part of the neritral Power to intern coversnot only the aircraft, but its equipment and contents.  The obligationis not affected by the circumstance which led to the military aircraftcoming within the  jurisdiction.  It applies whether the belligerentaircraft entered neutral jurisdiction, voluntarily or involuntarily, and whatever the cause.   It is an obligation owed to the opposing belli-gerent and is based upon the fact that the  aircraft has come into an area where it is not subject to attack by its  opponent.   The only exceptions to the obligation  to  intern an aircraft arethose arising under articles 17 and 41.    The first relates to. flyingambulances.   Under the second, an aircraft  on board a warship  is deemed to  be part of her, and  therefore will follow the fate  of  thatwarship if she enters  neutral ports or waters.  If  she enters undercircumstances which render her immune from internment, such air-craft will likewise escape internment.   The obligation  to  intern belligerent military  aircraft enteringneutral jurisdiction entails also the obligation to intern the personnel.These will in general be combatant members of the belligerent fight-ing forces, but experience has already shown that in time  of  warmilitary aeroplanes  are employed for  transporting passengers.   Asit may safely be assumed that in time of war  a passenger would notbe carried  on a belligerent military aircraft unless his journey  wasa matter of importance to the Government, it seems reasonable  alsoto comprise such passengers in the category of  persons to be interned.
                           Article 42.   A neutral Government  must  use  the  means at its disposal toprevent the entry ivithin its jurisdiction of belligerent military air-craft  and  to  compel  them  to  alight  if  they  have entered suchjurisdiction.   A neutral Government  shall  use  the  means at its disposal tointern any belligerent military aircraft which is within its jurisdictionafter  having alighted for any reason whatsoever,  together ivith itscrew and the passengers, if  any.   Under  article  15 of the Convention for  the adaptation  of theprinciples of the Geneva Convention to Maritime War (No. X of 1907),the shipwrecked, wounded  or sick members  of the crew of a belli-gerent warship,  who are  brought into a neutral port,  must be interned.   The same rule is applied by article 43 to the personnel of adisabled belligerent  military aircraft, when the men are brought inon board  a military aircraft.    It goes without saying that suchindividuals could not be brought in and landed at a neutral port with-out the consent of the neutral authorities.                           Article 43.   The personnel of a disabled belligerent military aircraft rescuedoutside neutral ivaters and brought into the jurisdiction of a neutralState by a neutral military aircraft and there landed shall be interned.   The principle is well established in international law that in timeof war a Government, which remains neutral, must not itself supply to a  belligerent Government arms or war material.   For aerial war-fare effect is given to this principle by the following article :                            Article 44.   The supply in any manner, directly or indirectly,  by a neutralGovernment to a  belligerent Power of aircraft, parts of aircraft,  ormaterial, supplies or munitions required for aircraft is forbidden.   No obligation rests on a  neutral State to prevent the purchase bya  belligerent  Government  of articles of  contraband from personswithin the neutral jurisdiction.   The purchase of contraband under such  conditions  constitutes a  commercial  transaction  which  thaneutral Government is under no obligation to prevent, although the opposing  belligerent may  take  such means as international lawauthorises to intercept  the delivery of  the  articles to his enemy.This principle has already been embodied in article  7 of the Conven-tion concerning the  rights and duties of neutral Powers in land war(Convention V of 1907) and in article 7 of the corresponding conven-tion for maritime war  (Convention XIII of 1907).   To apply it toaerial warfare, the following article has been adopted :                            &apos; Article 45.   Subject to  the provisions of  article 46, a neutral  Poioer is  notbound to  prevent the export or transit on behalf of abelligerent of
aircraft, parts of aircraft, or material, supplies or munitions for air-cmft.   An exception to the principle that a neutral State  is under no obligation to prevent the export of arms and war material, is foundin the accepted rule of  international law that neutral territory mustnot be utilised as a base of  operations by a belligerent Government,,and that the neutral State must  therefore prevent the fitting out ordeparture from  its. jurisdiction of any  hostile expedition  intendedto operate on behalf of  one  belligerent against the other.   Such an expedition  might consist  of a  single aeroplane,  if manned   and equipped in a manner which would enable it to take part in hostilities,or carrying or accompanied  by the necessary elements of such equip-ment.  Consequently, its departure under circumstances  which would constitute the despatch of a hostile expedition,  must be prevented by the neutral Government.   It is easy to  see that it is aircraft which have flown out of theneutral  jurisdiction,  which  are  most  likely  to engage  in hostilities in some form before delivery to the belligerent purchaser in the belli-gerent State, and it  is  in these cases that the neutral  government must take special precautions.  All risk will be avoided if the aircraft,despatched to the order of a belligerent Power, does not  come withinthe neighbourhood of the operations of the opposing belligerent.  Thoneutral State should therefore prescribe the route which the aircraft is to follow.   This alone, however, will not  be sufficient.  The aircraft might ignore the  instructions it receives.  Guarantees for compliancemust therefore be exacted.  It will be  for the neutral State  to deter -mine  the  guarantees which it thinks necessary, but they  must be effective guarantees,  such, for instance, as insisting on the aircraftcarrying a representative of the Government to see that the routeindicated is followed.   To meet   these  requirements,  the following article has beenadopted :                            Article 46.                  -  -   A neutral Government is  bound to use the means at its disposal :--   1. To prevent the departure from its jurisdiction of an aircraft in          a condition to make a hostile  attack against  a belligerent          Power, or carrying  or accompanied  by appliances  or          materials the  mounting or utilisation of which would          enable it  to  make a hostile attack, if there  is reason to          believe that  such aircraft  is  destined for use against  a          belligerent Power.   2. To  prevent the  departure of an  aircraft  the crew of which          includes  any member  of the combatant forces of a belli-          gerent Power.   3. To prevent work upon an aircraft  designed  to prepare it to          depart in contravention of the purposes of this article..   On the departure  by air  of any  aircraft.despatched by persons or companies in neutral jurisdiction to the order of a belligerent Power,
the  neutral Government  must prescribe for such aircraft a routeavoiding the neighbourhood of the military operations of the opposingbelligerent, and must exact whatever guarantees may  be required toensure that the aircraft follows the route prescribed.    The height to which aircraft can ascend  would enable them to beused for observation purposes from a spot within neutral jurisdiction,,i.e., within the airspace above neutral territory or territorial waters,if hostilities were in progress close to the frontier between two States.Such proceedings might be extremely harmful &quot;to belligerent interests,and if the observations were made on behalf  of one of the belligerents&quot;and for the purpose of supplying him with information,&quot; would amountto an improper use  of neutral territory.   To meet this contingency,the following provision has been adopted :                             Article 47.     ,4 neutral..State is bound to take such steps  as the means at its disposal permit to prevent within its jurisdiction aerial observation of the movements, operations or defences  of one belligerent, with the intention of informing the other belligerent.    The prohibition  of aerial  observation within neutral territory onbelligerent account must apply equally to the ease of aircraft on boardbelligerent  warships&quot; when in neutral waters.  To avoid all miscOn-ception on this point, the  following paragraph has been added :     This provision applies equally to a belligerent military  aircraft on board a vessel cf war.    The  measures which a neutral Government may be obliged totake to compel respect for its rights may entail the use of force :  firemay have to be opened on foreign aircraft,  even military aircraft of another  State.  Following the analogy of  article  10 of Convention V&quot;of i907  (Rights and  Duties  of Neutral Powers  in Land War)   and article 26 of Convention XIII (Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers&quot;in  Maritime  War),  it has been thought well  to  declare  that  themeasures,  even of force, taken by a neutral Power for this purposecannot be regarded as acts of war.&quot;  Still less could they be regardedas unfriendly acts, seeing that they are taken in specific exercise of rights conferred or recognised by treaty.    It may  be well to add that the neutral  Government will not beresponsible for any injury or damage done to the -aircraft or otherobject.,                            Article 48.    The action of a  neutral power  in using  force or other means at its disposal in the exercise of its rights or  duties under these rulescannot be regarded as a hostile act.       &apos;     &apos;&quot;.&quot;&quot;&apos;
                        CHAPTER VII.          VISIT AND SEARCH, CAPTURE AND CONDEMNATION.,   Both the American and&apos;British drafts when first submitted to theCommission provided for the use of aircraft &quot;in  exercising against enemy commerce the belligerent rights which international law hassanctioned.  This principle.has not met with unanimous acceptance;the Netherlands Delegation has not felt able to accept it. The stand-point adopted by this Delegation is  that the custom  and practice ofinternational law is limited to a right on the part of belligerent war-ships to capture after certain formalities merchant vessels  employedin the carriage of  such  commerce.   No justification exists for theextension of those rights  to an aircraft, which is a new engine of warentirely different.in character from a warship and unable to exerciseover  merchant vessels or private aircraft  a control  similar to thatexercised by a warship over merchant vessels.  Consequently thereis no reason to confer on a military aircraft the right to make capturesas if  it were a warship, and no reason to subject commerce to capturewhen carried  in an aircraft.&apos;  . In developing international law thetendency should be in the direction of conferring greater,  not  less,immunity on private property.   For these  reasons the Netherlands Delegation  has.not acceptedthe rules contained in Chapter VII and its participation in the discus-sion of individual rules has been subject to the general reserves madewith  regard to the whole  chapter.   The majority  of the  delegations  have not felt able to reject theprinciple that the aircraft should be allbwed to exercise  the belli-gerent right of visit and search, followed by capture where necessary,for the repression of enemy commerce carried in an aircraft in caseswhere such action  is permissible.    This  principle is  embodied inarticle 49, of which the text is as follows :                            Article  49.   Private aircraft  are liable  to visit and search and to capture  bybelligerent military  aircraft.   No article  on, the subject of the  exercise by belligerent military aircraft of the right of visit and search of merchant vessels has secured the votes of a majority of the Delegations,  and therefore no articleon the subject is included in the code of rules.  Nevertheless, all thoDelegations are impressed with the necessity  of  surrounding  with proper safeguards  the   use  of&apos;aircraft  against merchant  vessels.Otherwise excesses  analogous to those which took place during therecent war might be reproduced in fufure wars.   The reason why no agreed text has been adopted by the  Commis-sion is- due to divergence  of view as to what action an aircraft shouldbe permitted to take against a merchant  vessel.     -  &apos;   The aircraft in  use to-day are ligljt and  fragile things.  Exceptin favourable circumstances they would not be able to alight on the
water and send a man on board a merchant vessel at the spot wherethe merchant vessel is first encountered (visite sur place). To makethe right of visit and search by an aircraft effective  it would usuallybe necessary to  direct the  merchant vessel to come to some con-venient locality where the aircraft can alight and send men on board for the  purpose.  This would  imply a right on the part of the belli-gerent military  aircraft to  compel  the merchant vessel to deviatefrom her course  before  it was  in possession of  any proofs  derivedfrom an examination of the ship herself  and her papers that therewere circumstances of suspicion which  justified such  interferencewith neutral trade.  If the deviation which the merchant vessel wasobliged  to make was prolonged, as  might be the case if the aircraft was operating far from land,  the losses and inconvenience imposed on neutral shipping would, be very heavy.    Is or is not a  warship  entitled  to oblige a merchant vessel todeviate  from her course for the  purpose of enabling  the right of visit and search to be carried out?   Would an aircraft  be exercising itsrights in conformity  with the rules to &quot;which surface  warships are subject  if it obliged a merchant vessel to  deviate from her course inthis way?   Even  if a warship is  entitled on occasion to oblige a merchant vessel to  deviate from her  course before visiting her, can asimilar  right be  recognised for military aircraft without opening the door to  very great abuses ?   These are the questions upon which the views entertained by the delegations differed appreciably, and indicate the reasons why it wasnot found possible to devise any text  on which all parties could agree.   The French Delegation declared that aircraft must conform to therules to which surface warships are subject.   The French Delegation proposed the following text:        &quot; Aircraft are forbidden to operate against merchant vessels,   whether surface or submarine, without conforming to the rules to    which surface warships are subject.&quot;    In view  of the differences  of opinion manifested  in  regard to theabove questions, the Delegation regarded this formula as the onlyone which  was  likely to receive the support of a  majority cf theCommission.    The American  Delegation  considered that  a  merchant vesselshould  be boarded wdien she  is encountered,  but maintained that,even if a departure from this rule might in exceptional circumstances be permitted in visit and soarch by surface ships, a similar concession to aircraft, with their limited means of boarding, would readily havethe effect of converting the exception into  the  rule.  They statedthat they were not advised of anything in the record of the Washing-ion Conference  showing an intention to  authorise  surface ships orsubmarines to divert merchant vessels, without boarding them, to a port for examination;   but  that,  were  the case otherwise, theWashington Conference had  decided  that the subject of aircraft,which  presented difficulties of its  own  and which might involvequestions different  from those pertaining even to submarines, should
he dealt with&apos;separately;&apos; and that to. permit aircraft,, with  theirrapidity and range of flight, to control and direct by orders enforce-able by bombing, and without visit and search,  the  movement ofmerchant vessels on the high  seas would, in their&apos;opinion, give riseto an inadmissible situation.   The American  Delegation, therefore,  proposed  the  followingtext:                                         ;       &apos;&apos; Aircraft are forbidden to visit  and search surface or  sub-   surface  vessels without conforming in all respects to the rules to   which surface vessels authorised to conduct visit and search are   subject.       &quot;In view of the  irregularities to which the use of aircraft   against  merchant vessels might give  rise, it is declared that air-   craft, cannot divert a merchant  vessel  from  its course without   first boarding it; that in  no event may an  aircraft destroy a   merchant vessel unless the crew and passengers of such vessel   have first been  placed in safety; and that if an aircraft cannot&apos;   capture a merchant vessel  in conformity with these rules it must   desist from attack and from seizure and  permit such vessel to   proceed unmolested.&apos;&apos;   The British Delegation maintained that the  problem connectedwith visit and search of merchant vessels by aircraft was analogous to that of the exercise of such right by submarines, and that the most satisfactory solution of  the  problem would  be  to apply Mutatis Mutandis the wording of article 1 of the Treaty signed at Washington on the 6th  February, 1922, for the protection of the lives of neutralsand non-combatants at sea in time of war.    This Delegation maintained that by using the language of that treaty, as proposed, the question of the right  to oblige a  merchant vessel to deviate to a reasonable extent would be solved because the wording adopted at  Washington had  been modified so as to admit thi3right.  The British Delegates proposed the following text:        &apos;&apos; The use of aircraft against merchant vessels  must be regu-    lated by the following  provisions, which, being  in conformity    with the rules adopted by  civilised nations for the protection,of    the lives of neutrals and non-combatants  at sea in time of war,    are to be deemed an established part of international law:        &apos;&apos; A  merchant vessel must be ordered to submit to visit and    search to determine its character before it can be seized.       &apos;&apos; A merchant vessel must not be attacked unless it refuses to    submit to visit and search after warning or to proceed as directed    after seizure.       &apos;&apos; A merchant vessel must not be destroyed unless  the crew    and passengers  have first been placed in safety.       &apos;&apos; Belligerent aircraft are not under any circumstances exempt    from the universal rules above stated;  and if an aircraft cannot    capture a merchant vessel in conformity  with these rules, the    existing law of  nations requires  it to desist from attack and from    seizure and to permit the merchant vessel to proceed unmolested.&quot;
    The Japanese view was based on the practical difficulty in the way of exercise of the right of visit and search by aircraft.  Visit and search is a necessary preliminary to capture, and unless an aircraft is physically capable ol carrying it out, the recognition of the right of military aircraft to conduct operations against merchant vessels may lead to a  recurrence of the excesses practised against  enemy  and neutral merchant vessels in the submarine campaign initiated during the recent war.  Therefore, the Japanese  Delegation preferred not to recognise the right at  all.    But, in the end, as the amended American  text* removed the  greater part of their fear of possible abuse,  they expressed  readiness to accept  it, and suggested at the same time that the text had better be completed by the addition of the last sentence of the British text.    The Italian Delegation accepted the British  point of view; it maintained that diversion of merchant  vessels by surface warships was recognised and that the wording of the Washington Treaty should be repeated.   To prevent any abusive exercise of the right by air- craft, the Italian Delegation proposed to add  the following sentences to the  paragraphs of the Washington Treaty as set out in the British text:     After the first paragraph add        &apos;&apos; Visit  must in general be carried out where the merchant   vessel is first encountered.  Nevertheless, in cases where it may   be impossible to alight and  there is at the  same time good ground   for  suspicion,  the aircraft may order  the merchant vessel to   deviate to a suitable locality, reasonably  accessible, where she   may be visited.   If no good cause for this action is  shown, the   belligerent  State  must  pay compensation  for  the loss caused by   the order to deviate.&quot;   After the third  paragraph add -       &apos;&apos; If the merchant vessel  is  in the  territorial  waters  of the   enemy  State and not on the high seas,  she  may be destroyed   after previous notice has been given to the persons on board to   put themselv.es in a place of safety and reasonable  time has been   given them for so doing.&quot;   The Italian Delegation also  intimated that  for the sake of arriving at an agreement, it would vote in favour of  the  French text given above.   In accepting it, however, it declared :  (1) that in the existing practice of maritime war the majority of European Powers admitted that, if visit on the spot where the merchant vessel was encounteredwas impossible, surface warships  are entitled to oblige merchantvessels to deviate to  a suitable spot where the visit can take place; (2)  that, even  if  it is not  desired to rest on the maritime practiceindicated above, the  Italian Delegation must maintain the right of belligerent aircraft  to exercise  the  right of  visit in accordance withthe texts of the amendments proposed.                        *  See Minute 105.
   The Netherlands Delegation accepted the American proposal asthe one which limited most narrowly the exercise of belligerent rightsby aircraft.   When put to the vote the American proposal was supported by theJapanese and Netherlands Delegations and opposed by the British,French and Italian.    The French proposal was  opposed by  theAmerican,  British, Japanese and Netherlands Delegations.    The.British and  Italian  Delegations  explained that  they could  onlysupport it if it was amplified in the way indicated in the British andItalian amendments.   Although all  the  Delegations  concurred in the expression  of  a desire  to adopt such rules as  would assure the  observance  of  thedictates of humanity as regards the protection of the lives of neutralsand non-combatants,  the  Commission, by reason  of a divergence of views as to the method by which.this result would best be attained,was unable to agree upon an article dealing with the exercise of belli-gerent rights by  aircraft  against  merchant vessels.    The code ofrules proposed  by the  Commission therefore leaves the matter open for future regulation.   While aircraft are in flight  in the air, the operation of visit and search cannot be effected so long as aircraft retain their present form.Article 49 therefore necessitates the recognition  of a  right on  thepart of belligerent military aircraft to  order non-military aircraft toalight in order  that the right of visit and search  may  be exercised.They must not only be ordered to alight, but they-must  be allowed toproceed to a suitable locality for the purpose.  It would be a hardship to the neutral if he was obliged to  make a long journey for this  pur-pose and the locality must, therefore, not only be  suitable, but mustbe reasonably accessible-that is, reasonably convenient of access.A more precise definition than this  can  scarcely be given; wdiat is reasonably convenient of access is a question of fact to be determined in each case in the light of the  special circumstances which may be present.  If no  place can be found which is  reasonably convenient of access, the aircraft should be allowed to continue its flight.   As  is the case with merchant  vessels, a refusal to  comply withsuch belligerent directions will expose the aircraft to the use of force for the purpose of insisting on  compliance.   Just as the belligerentriglit has received universal acceptance in  maritime war, so is  theprinciple admitted that the neutral vessel is under a duty to submit to it and if in consequence of her failure to  do so she is damaged orsunk, she has  no right to complain, seeing that she&apos;  has failed tocomply with an obligation imposed upon her by the law of nations.This principle does not, however, entitle a belligerent to apply forceunnecessarily.  His measures of coercion must be limited to what is reasonably required to secure the fulfilment  of his object.   It is for this reason that a warship always fires a shot across thebows of a vessel before attempting  to hit the vessel herself, and, even when obliged to fire at the vessel herself, must still take all measureswithin her power  to rescue the crew and passengers.  Recognition of
a similar right on the part of aircraft to apply force must be con-ditioned by the obligation on the part of the aircraft not to apply force to a greater  extent than is necessary.   It would be so easy for theaircraft to take measures which might at once entail the  destructionof the aircraft and the loss  of life of everybody  therein that it isessential to recognise  the principle that force must only be emplyed to the extent which is  reasonably necessary.                            Article 50.   Belligerent military aircraft have the right to  order public non-military and private  aircraft  to alight in or proceed for visit and search to a suitable locality reasonably accessible.   Refusal, after warning, to obey such orders to alight or to proceedto such a locality for  examination exposes an aircraft to  the risk ofbeing fired upon.   The next article deals with the position  of  a neutral public non-military aircraft.  The future of commercial aviation may involvethe establishment of  State-owned lines of  aircraft for commercial purposes.  The principle has already  been recognised that such air-craft  must be  treated upon  the same footing as private  aircraft.Their subjection to the exercise of the right of  visit and  search andcapture must,  therefore, be  assured.    Where public non-military aircraft are not used for commercial purposes, the general rule mustapply according  to which a belligerent warship can only  visit  thepublic vessels of a friendly Power so far as may be necessary for thepurpose  of ascertaining their  character, i.e., by the verification oftheir papers.                            Article 51.   Neutral public non-military aircraft, other  than those which areto be treated as private aircraft, are subject  only to visit for the pur-pose of the verification of their papers.   Article 52 applies  to aircraft in time of  war the principle which already obtains in the case of  merchant vessels,  namely, that anenemy merchant vessel is liable to capture in all circumstances.                            Article 52.   Enemy private aircraft are liable to capture in all circumstances,   The next article deals with the grounds upon which a neutralprivate aircraft may be captured.   (a.)  The first is where it  resists the legitimate exercise of  belli-gerent rights.  This is in harmony with article 68 of the Declarationof London.   As first submitted to the  Commission, the text included the words &quot;or flees.&quot;  On due consideration, however, these wordswere omitted.  The reasons for this omission cannot be stated better
than isdohe in the report on&apos;article 68 of the Declaration of London,prepared by M. Eenault:        &quot;If the vessel is stopped, and it is shown that it was  only in   order to escape the inconvenience of being searched that recourse   was had to flight, and that beyond this she had done nothing con-   trary to neutrality, she will not be  punished for her attempt at   flight. If, on the other hand, it is established that the vessel has   contraband on board, or that she has in some way or other failed   to comply  with her duty as a neutral, she will suffer the cons&quot;-   quences of her infraction of neutrality, but in this case, as in the   last, she will not undergo any punishment for her attempt at   flight. Expression was given to the contrary view, namely, that   a ship should be punished  for an obvious attempt at flight as   much as for  forcible resistance.  It was suggested that the pro-   speet of having the escaping vessel condemned as good prize would   influence the captain of the cruiser to do his best  to spare her.   But in the  end this view did not prevail.&quot;   (b.) The second ground for capture is that the failure of a  neutre:aircraft to comply with directions given by a belligerent commanding officer  enjoining the withdrawal of neutral aircraft from the imme-diate vicinity of  his military operations.  By the terms of article 30.a neutral aircraft disregarding such a prohibition is exposed to therisk of being fired upon.   It might well be thought that  such riskwould involve  a sufficient deterrent without rendering non-compliancea ground of capture. The reason why capture has been-added is dueto the  peculiar circumstances of warfare in the air.   The right tooblige  aircraft to avoid the scene of military operations  would onlybe made use of in cases where it was a matter of importance to the belligerent to ensure their absence, and consequently where effective measures must be taken  to secure  compliance.   If a neutral  privateaircraft is to b,e fired upon for this purpose, it is desirable to render itas little likely  as possible  that it shall be fired upon in a way that will involve its destruction.  If the airman knows that the aircraft, whenforced  to alight, may  be made the  subject of capture, he  is  lesstempted to secure observance of the rule by firing in a way which will involve the destruction of the aircraft.   (c.) The third ground for capture is where the aircraft is engagedin unneutral service.  This phrase &quot; unneutral service &quot;  formed thesubject of careful consideration in the Naval Conference of london in 1908 and 1909, at the time when the Declaration of London wasframed.  The meaning attached to the term by the Commission inthe preparation of the present text is that used in articles 45  and 46of that Declaration, the intention being to render those articles appli-cable in  the case of similar action  on the part of aircraft.   Eorinstance, it will cover an act amounting to  taking a direct  part in hostilities, such as that mentioned in the second paragraph ofarticle  16.  The Commission would also refer to that portion of the report  on the Declaration of London&apos;  which deals with unneutralservice (articles  45 and 46) as they are in entire concurrence with it.    [11463]                                              B
   ,(d.) The fourth ground for capture is that a neutral private air-craft is armed in violation of article 16, which stipulates that outsideits own jurisdiction a  private aircraft must not be  armed.   Thocarriage of arms by a private aircraft under such circumstances  gives rise to a well-founded suspicion of an intention to take part in hostilities-ties in violation of the laws of war.   (e.) The fifth ground for capture is that an aircraft has no marksor is bearing false marks in violation of article 19.   (/.) The sixth  ground  for capture is the  absence  or irregularityof the napers  of the aircraft.   This rule is in  accordance with thatwhich prevails in maritime warfare.   The  papers which  must becarried are indicated with greater precision in article  54.   (g.) The seventh ground for capture is that of an aircraft being found manifestly out of the proper line, of its flight as indicated by itspapers and where no sufficient reason is found for its presence in thatlocality.  The importance of this rule from the point of view of aerialwarfare is due to the ease with which aircraft can be used for recon-naisance work, even though they may be masquerading  as neutralaircraft engaged on innocent occupations. It may well be that in anyparticular case the aircraft will  be able to establish the innocence ofits presence.  It may have been blown ont of its course; it may havebeen compelled to make a deviation to secure supplies; it may evenhave  intentionally  deviated for the  purpose  of avoiding an area inwhich it considered that military  operations were possible.   It istherefore to the interests of both parties the belligerent  and theneutral that ample opportunity for enquiry should be given to the belligerent before  exercising his right of capture.    It will only bewhere the  results  of  such investigations show that there is  good cause for suspicion that the aircraft was engaged in some improperoperations  that capture will be  resorted to.   (h.) The eighth ground for  capture is where the neutral privateaircraft carries, or itself constitutes; contraband of war.  This sub-bead  is framed upon the basis that the  term &quot;contraband  of war&quot;will bear the same meaning as it has  in maritime warfare.   (i.) The ninth ground for capture is that the aircraft is  engagedin a breach of  blockade;  &quot; Blockade  &quot; is here used in the same  sensein which it is employed in Chapter 1 of the Declaration of  London,that is to say, an  operation of war for the purpose of preventing bythe use of warships ingress or egress of commerce to or from a definedportion of  the enemy&apos;s coast.   It has no reference to a  blockadeenforced without  the,use  of warships, nor  does  it  cover  militaryinvestments of  particular  localities on land.    These operations,which may be termed &quot; aerial-blockade,&quot; were  the subject of specialexamination by the experts attached  to the various Delegations, whoframed a special report  on the subject for consideration by  the FullCommission.    The  conditions contemplated in this sub-head arethose of warships enforcing a blockade at sea with aircraft acting inco-operation with  them.   As the primary elements of the  blockadewill, therefore, be maritime, the recognised principles applicable tosuch blockade, as for instance, that it must be effective (Declarationof Paris, article 4), and that it must be duly  notified and  its precise
limits fixed, will also apply.  This is intended to bo shown by the useof the words  &apos;&apos; breach  of  blockade  duly  established and effectivelymaintained &apos;&apos;  in the text of the sub-head.   It is too early yet to indicate with precision the extent  to whichthe co-operation of aircraft in the maintenance of blockade at seamay be possible;  experience alone can  show.  Nevertheless,  it isnecessary to  indicate the sense in  which the Commission  has  used the word &quot;effective.&quot;   As  pointed out in the Declaration of London,the effectiveness of  a blockade is  a. question  of fact.   The word&quot;effective&quot; is intended to ensure  that it must be maintained  by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the enemy coast-line.  Theprize  court may, for  instance, have to consider what proportion of surface vessels  can  escape  the  watchfulness  of the  blockadingsquadrons without  endangering  the effectiveness  of  the blockade;this is a question which the prize court alone can determine.  In thesame way, this question may have to be considered where aircraft are co-operating in the maintenance of a blockade.   lire invention of  the aircraft cannot  impose upon a belligerentwho desires to institute a blockade  the obligation to employ aircraft in co-operation with his naval forces.    If he does not do so,  the effectiveness of the blockade would  not be affected  by failure to stopaircraft passing through.  It is only where the belligerent endeavours to render his blockade effective in the air-space above the sea as wellas on the surface itself that captures of aircraft will  be made and thatany question  of the effectiveness of the  blockade  in the air could arise.   The facility  with which  an  aircraft, desirous of  entering  thoblockaded area,  could evade  the blockade  by  passing  outside  the geographical limits of the blockade has not  escaped the attention ofthe Commission.   This practical question may affect the extent towhich belligerents will  resort to blockade in future, but it  does not affect the fact that where  a blockade has been  established and an aircraft attempts to pass through into the blockaded area within thelimits of the blockade, it should be liable to capture.   The Netherlands  Delegation proposed  to  suppress (i)  on  thegrounds  that  air  blockade  could  not be  effectively  maintained,basing its opinion on  its interpretation of the experts&apos; report on thesubject.   The British,  French, Italian and Japanese  Delegations voted forits maintenance.   The American  Delegation voted for its main-tenance ad referendum.   (7c.) The tenth ground for capture is that the private aircraft hasbeen transferred from belligerent to neutral  nationality with a viewto escaping the disadvantages which enemy status  confers upon air-craft.  This sub-head has been inserted in order that so far as possiblethe rules applicable to maritime warfare should apply to warfare inthe air.   The sub-head as adopted does not embody the detailed provisionsof the Declaration of London ^(articles  55  and 56)  because thosearticles constituted a  compromise between two competing principles and have not stood the test of experience.
   The- sub-heads &apos; enumerated above  comprise1 those which theCommission has considered sufficient to justify capture.  Experiencemay show that other cases will arise in which capture may be neces-sary, as great development may yet occur in the science of aviation.   The article concludes with a proviso that the act which constitutes the ground of capture must have occurred in the course of  the  flightin which the neutral  aircraft  came  into  belligerent  hands.   Thisproviso would not, of course, apply to the  case of transfer from  belli-gerent to neutral nationality.   Account must also be taken of the special case  provided for  inarticle 6 of the rules for the control  of radio  in  time of war underwhich  merchant vessels or  aircraft transmitting intelligence may  incertain circumstances  be liable to capture for a period  of one year from the commission of the act complained of.                            Article 58.   A neutral private aircraft is liable to capture if it    (a.) Resists the legitimate exercise of  belligerent rights.   (b.) Violates a prohibition of which it  has had  notice issued by a          belligerent commanding officer under article 80.   (c.) 7s engaged in unneutral. service.  - (d.) Is armed in time of war when outside the jurisdiction  of  its          own country.   (e.) Has no external marks  or uses false marks.   (f.) Has no papers or insufficient  or irregular papers.   (g.) Is manifestly out of the line between the point of  departure.          and the point  of destination indicated  in  its papers and          after sucli enquiries as the belligerent may deem necessary,          no good cause is shown for the deviation.  The aircraft,          together with its crew  and passengers, if any, may  b?          detained by the belligerent, pending such enquiries.   (h.) Carries,  or itself constitues,  contraband of war.   (i.) 7s  engaged  in breach  of a  blockade  duly  established and          effectively maintained.   (k.) 77as been transferred from belligerent to neutral nationality          at a&apos; date and in circumstances indicating an  intention  oi          evading the consequences  to which  an enemy aircraft,  as          such, is exposed.   Provided that in  each case (except (k)) the ground for captureshall be an act carried out in the flight in which the neutral aircraftcame into  belligerent hands, i.e., since it left its point of  departureand  before it reached its point of destination.   By custom  and tradition practical uniformity has arisen as to the papers which a merchant vessel is expected to carry.    There  is no serious divergence between  the legislation now in force in civilisedcountries.  No practical inconvenience, therefore, arises in  the appli-cation  of the established rule of maritime  war, that a vessel is  liableto capture if it has no papers or if the papers are iyregular.  Similar
5381 uniformity would no.doubt in time arise in-connection.with aircraft, particularly  if  the  Air  Navigation  Convention  of 1919  becomes universal.  It has,  however, been  thought prudent to indicate&apos; in a special article the facts which the papers found on board an aircraft must indicate if its  papers are to be held sufficient.  Under article 6 the papers to be borne by an aircraft are those prescribed by the laws of its own State.  The forms, names and number of such papers are therefore a matter to be determined by each State except so far as it may already  be bound by treaty stipulations.  Article 54 prescribes the points that must be established by such papers, that is to say, it ensures that the  papers shall give the belligerent information on the points which  it is important for him to know.  They must show the nationality of the aircraft, the names and nationality of the crew and the passengers, the points of departure and destination of  tho flight, particulars of the cargo,  and must include the necessary logs. The legislation in force in each  State  must be sufficient to  satisfy this rule if it desires that its aircraft shall escape trouble in time of war.   It  is not  thought that  this article will involve  any  incon- venience, as legislation which would not prescribe  at least as much as the above on the subject of  aircraft is unlikely to be enacted by any State.                            Article 54.    The papers of a private aircraft xcill  be regarded as insufficient or irregular if they  do  not establish the nationality of the aircraft and indicate the names  and nationality of  the crew and passengers,  the points of departure  and destination of  the flight, together with par- ticidars of the cargo  and the conditions under which it is transported. The logs must also  be included.     -  , &apos;   The practice has now become universal for belligerent States to institute a prize court in.which proceedings will take place  for adjudi- cating on all cases of capture of ships or goods effected in maritime war.    It is  in the  interest of neutrals that  this system has been developed.  If aircraft are to be  allowed to exercise the belligerent right of capture, it is only proper tk*t the same protection should be accorded to neutrals as in the case of captures effected by warships This view has readily obtained unanimous assent,  and is embodied in article 55.                           Article 55.   Capture of an aircraft or  of goods on board an aircraft  shall be made the subject of prize proceedings, in order that any neutral claim may be duly heard and determined.  - The provisions of articles  52 and 53 deal  only with the grounds for capture.   They do not prescribe the rule  which is to be applied by the prize court.    Reflection has led  the Commission to the viewthat, save in  certain exceptional cases where aircraft will have been captured for reasons peculiar to aerial warfare, the decisions of thsprize courts in adjudicating on  captures effected by aircraft,  should     [11463]      &apos;                                           1&quot;
proceed phtthe same principles as those which obtain in captures by warships.  If the jurisdiction of the prize courts is to apply in aerialwarfare as well as in maritime warfare, it is convenient that the rulesapplied should be the same in both cases.. It would be impossible to frame an exact code,&apos; at the present stage, of the rules which prizecourts apply,  nor indeed would it be within the competence of this commission to do so as far.as concerns maritime  warfare.  It wouldcertainly lead to divergence between rules applied.in the case of aerial captures and those applied in the  case of maritime  captures.The simplest solution has therefore been found in  the adoption of theprinciple that the prize court should apply  the same rules in  botheases.                ,          *  &quot;             .           .    The special cases which have, to be provided for are those whereah aircraft has no marks or has used false marks, or has been foundarmed in time of war outside the jurisdiction of its own country, andalso in the case where.a neutral aircraft has violated the rule that itmust  not  infringe  the  directions of the belligerent  commanding officer to keep away from the immediate vicinity of his military opera-ions.  In  these  cases it  is agreed that the aircraft should be liableto condemnation.                            Article 56.    A  private aircraft  captured upon  the  ground that it has noexternal marks or is using false marks, or that it is armed in time ofwar outside  the  jurisdiction of its own  country, is  liable to con-condemnation.    A neutral private aircraft captured upon the  ground that it hasdisregarded the direction of a belligerent  commanding officer underarticle 30 is liable to condemnation, unless it can  justify its presencewithin the  prohibited zone.    In all other cases, the prize court in adjudicating upon any caseo) capture  of an  aircraft  or its cargo, or of postal correspondence on board an aircraft, shall, apply the same rules as would be applied to a merchant vessel  or Us cargo or to posta.1 correspondence on board a merchant vessel.    The destruction of neutral merchant  vessels first came into pro-minence as a belligerent practice at the time of the russo-japanese war.   It was not without difficulty that an agreement was reached between the Powers as to the-extent to which the practice  should berecognised in  maritime  war.    In the  case of enemy vessels, thepractice has always been recognised as legitimate,  subject to the over-riding principle  that the persons on board must  be placed in safety and the papers of  the vessel must be secured.    This principle hasbeen adapted to  aerial warfare  by article  57, of which  the text is asfollows:                             Article. 57.    Private aircraft which  are found upon  visit and  search to. be enemy aircraft may be destroyed if the belligerent  commanding officerfinds it necessary to do so, provided, that all persons on board have
first been placed in safety and all the papers of the aircraft have beenpreserved.    The articles dealing  with  the destruction of neutral aircraft arolargely based upon the provisions of the Declaration of London, butthe language used is of a more restrictive character, so as to reducethe possibilities of an abuse of the  practice,  as happened in the late war.  Destruction is limited to cases where an aircraft is captured in circumstances which show that it. would be liable to condemnation onthe  ground of  unneutral service, or on  the ground that it has nomarks, or bears false marks.   Apart from these cases,  destructioncan  only be justified by  the existence of grave military emergencieswhich would not justify the officer in command in releasing the air-craft.  In all cases, destruction must be justified by the circumstancethat sending the aircraft in for adjudication  would be impossible, or would imperil the safety of the belligerent aircraft or the success ofthe operations in which it is engaged.                           Article 58.    Private  aircraft  which are found  upon  visit and  search  to beneutral aircraft liable to condemnation upon  the ground of unneutralservice, of upon the ground that they have no external marks  or arehearing false marks, may be destroyed, if sending them in for adjudi-cation would be impossible or would imperil the safety of the belli-gerent aircraft or the success of the  operations in which it is engagedApart from the cases mentioned above, a  neutral private aircraftmust not be destroyed except in the gravest military emergency,wltich would not justify  the  officer in  colnmnand in releasing it orsending it in for adjudication.  &apos;       1    The safeguards  designed  to ensure full protection for neutralinterests in the case of  any such destruction are  embodied inarticle 59.   The persons on board must be  placed in safety.   the papers must  be  secured in  order  that they may  be availablein the forthcoming prize  court proceedings.   The captor must thenbring the case before the prize court and must establish,  firstly, theneed foi: destruction, and, secondly, when  that is  established,  the validity of the capture.  Failure to establish the first point will exposehim to the risk of paying compensation  to all the parties interestedin the aircraft and its cargo.   Failure to establish the second willplace him in the same position in which he  would be if the aircraft had not been destroyed, and lie had been ordered to make restitutionof the aircraft or cargo improperly captured.                           Article 59.   Before a neutral private aircraft  is destroyed, all persons on  boardmust be placed in safety, and all the papers of  the aircraft must be preserved.           j   A captor who has destroyed a neutral private aircraft must bringthe capture  before the prize court,  and must first establish that he
                        CHAPTEE VIII.                           DEFINITIONS.   In  some  countries,  the word  &quot;military&quot;  is  not  generallyemployed in a  sense  which includes  &quot;naval.&quot;    To remove anyambiguity on this point a special article has been adopted.                            Article 61.   The term  &quot;military &quot;  throughout these rules  is to be read asreferring to all branches of the forces, i.e., the land forces,  the naval forces and the air forces.   Article  62  is  intended  to remove all risk of doubt as to whetheraircraft personnel should, in matters not covered by these rules orby conventions as to the application of which there can be  no doubt,was justified in destroying it-under article&apos;58.   If he fails to do this,parties interested in the aircraft or its cargo are entitled to compensu-tion.  If the capture is held to he invalid, though the act of destructionis  held to  have  been justifiable, compensation must  be  paid  to theparties interested in place of the restitution to which they would havebeen entitled.   The special  case of the  destruction of contraband on board an aircraft,  apart from the  destruction of the  aircraft  itself, is dealtwith in article 60, which proceeds on lines similar to article 54 of theDeclaration of London.   After the contraband has been destroyed,the aircraft will be allowed to  continue its flight.  Similar provision is made for the protection of neutral interests as under the precedingarticles.   The article as adopted is limited to absolute contraband, but threeDelegations considered that the word &quot;absolute&quot;  should  be deleted,and that the article should extend to all forms of contraband, as inarticle 54 of the Declaration of London.                            Article 60.    Where a neutral private aircraft is captured on the ground thaiit-  is carrying contraband, the captor may demand the surrender ofany absolute contraband on  board, or may proceed to  the  destructionof such absolute contraband, if sending  in the aircraft for adjudicationis  impossible or would imperil the safety of the  belligerent aircraft or the success of the operations in which it is engaged.  After enteringin the log book of the aircraft the delivery or destruction of the goods,and securing, in original or copy, the relevant papers of the aircraft,the captor  must allow  the neutral aircraft to continue its flight.   The provisions of  the second paragraph Of Article 59 will applywhere absolute contraband on  board  a neutral  private aircraft ishanded over or destroyed.
he governed by the Land Warfare Eegulations  or by the unwritten&apos;rules governing maritime war.   The rules to be applied are  those contained in the Land Warfare Regulations.   Regard must be hadto the last paragraphs of the&apos; Convention to which the Land WarfareRegulations are  attached,, that cases  not provided  for  are not intended, for want of a written prohibition, to be left to the arbitraryjudgment of military commanders.  In all such  cases the population and belligerents are to remain under the protection of the rule of thnprinciples of the law of nations&quot;, as they result from the usages estab-lished between civilised nations, from the laws of humanity and the.requirements of the public conscience.   The French Delegation expressed the opinion that the terms  ofarticle  62 were hardly adequate to cover a subject so complex.                           Article 62.   Except so far as special rules are  here laid down and except alsoso jar as the provisions of Chapter VII of these Rules or international conventions indicate that maritime law and procedure are applicable,aircraft personnel engaged in hostilities come under the  laws of warand neutrality applicable to land troops in virtue of the  custom and practice  of international  law  and of the various declarations andconventions to which the States concerned are parties.                          Jurisdiction.   The British draft code contained an  article  (No. 9) stipulatingthat for  the purpose  of the proposed rules, territory over which a power  exercises a  protectorate or a  mandate, and also  protectedStates; should be assimilated to the national territory of that Power.The Japanese Delegation drew attention to the necessity of providingalso for the case of leased territories if.any such article were adopted;Throughout the  articles adopted the word  &quot;jurisdiction&quot; is  used.The Commission has considered the question whether it is necessaryto add  a  definition of the word &quot;jurisdiction,&quot; and has come to theconclusion that it  would be better not to do so.   The  area withinwhich each State is responsible is well understood; no  difficulty  ofthis sort arises in  practice; and no inconvenience has been causedby the  absence of any such definition from Convention No. XIII,  of1907, in which the word &quot;jurisdiction&quot; is used in a manner very similar to that in which it is used in the present rules.                  Marginal Territorial Air Belt.   An interesting  proposal was  made by the Italian Delegation thatalong the coast of every State the national jurisdiction in the air-space should for aerial  purposes extend to 10 miles.  The proposaldid  not  comprise  any extension of  territorial  waters generally,  amatter which would have been outside the reference to the Commis-sion under the terms of the Washington Resolution.   Detailed consideration  of the  proposal  led  the majority of the delegations to  think that the suggestion is not practicable.
   It seems inevitable that great confusion would follow from anyrule  which  laid down a different width for the territorial airspacefrom that recognised for territorial waters,  more particularly in thecase of neutral  countries for whose  benefit and protection the pro-posal is put forward.-   As an. example it is only necessary to takearticle 42, which  obliges a neutral State to endeavour to compel abelligerent military aircraft entering its jurisdiction to  alight.   IIthe aircraft  entered the jurisdiction from over the high seas, it would do so at 10  miles  from the coast, and, if.in compliance with neutralorders  it forthwith alighted on the water, it would then be outsidethe neutral  jurisdiction, and the neutral State  could not intern theaircraft.                                -   On principle it would seem that  the jurisdiction in the airspaceshould be appurtenant to the territorial jurisdiction enjoyed beneathit, and that  in the absence of a territorial jurisdiction beneath, thereis no sound  basis for jurisdiction in the air.   Furthermore, it is felt that the obligation to enforce  respect  forneutral rights throughout  a 10-mile  belt would  impose an increasedburden on  neutral Powers  without  adequate compensating advan-tages.   Even with this wider belt it would still be easy  for airmenfighting in the air to lose  their bearings in the  heat of the combat,and  to encroach inadvertently on neutral jurisdiction.  Lastly, thegreater the  distance from  the coast, the more difficult it is for theposition of an aircraft to be determined  with  precision, and the more frequent,  therefore, will disputes become between belligerent and neutral States as to violation by the former&apos;s aircraft of the latter&apos;3jurisdiction.            .                          &apos;    .   With, a view to meeting these criticisms, the Italian  Delegationrecast the proposal in a&apos;different  slHipe;,,and. suggested that in time ofwar  a  State, whether neutral or belligerent, should be  authorised,if it so desired,- and if it.notified other Powers accordingly.at tliobeginning of the war, to extend its jurisdictioh-.over the marginal air-belt to  a distance of 10 miles at any given places along its:coast.  Inthis  form the proposal would have placed no burden upon neutrals,because they would not have made- use of it unless they considered it to their advantage.  The anomalies of the divergent widths of the marginal air-belt and the marginal belt of sea would have remained.   After due consideration of the proposal, the majority of the Dele-gations felt unable to accept the proposal even in its amended form.   The Italian. Delegation made  the following statement:    1. It does not think it desirable to resume in Plenary commission the discussion of a question which has on several occasions been con-sidered in all the  necessary detail during the meetings of the Sub-Committee.                                 .   2. Nevertheless, although the majority  of the Delegations havealready put forward views opposed to  its  proposal, it continues  tobelieve in the importance  of that proposal and  in the necessity  forits adoption and insertion in an international convention.   3. Prom the point of view both of belligerent and of neutral States,there are  reasons  of the highest juridical and technical  importance
which make it indispensable to allow each State the power of includ-ing in its jurisdiction the atmospheric space to a distance of 10 milesfrom its coast.   4. The difficulties  resulting from  the  difference  between  thewidth of the  marginal, air-belt and the width of national territorial waters would not seem to be so serious as to render the Italian pro-posal unacceptable in practice.   5. In any case, there is no juridical obstacle to the fixing of thesame width of space for the marginal air-belt as for territorial waters,the Italian Delegation being of opinion that international law, as generally  recognised,  contains  no  rule  prohibiting  a  State fromextending its territorial waters to a distance of 10 sea-miles from itscoasts.                                                        -   6. In  conclusion,  it urges that  a  question of  such paramount importance should be  reopened and placed  upon  the agenda of aconference in the near future.              COMPENSATION  AND DISPUTES.   The Netherlands Delegation submitted the following proposal:    &quot;The belligerent Party who, intentionally,  or through  negligence-gence, violates the provisions of the present rules is liable to pay com-pensation in ease damage is caused as  a result of such violation.Such Party will be responsible for all acts committed by  members ofhis armed forces.   &apos;&apos; If any dispute should arise on the  subject which is not otherwisesettled, such dispute shall be submitted for settlement  to the Per-manent Court  of Arbitration, in  conformity with Convention I of1907, or to the Permanent Court of International Justice, in respectof such States  as have accepted  as  compulsory ipso facto its juris-diction.&quot;   The Commission approving the  principle of indemnity, decidedto incorporate the proposal in its general report, so as to bring it tothe attention of the Governments.                           ..  .                 VIOLATION OF THE EULES.   No provision is made in the articles adopted  as to the penaltiesto which  persons violating the rules are to be subject.  Some of  theprovisions in the drafts laid before the Commission stated that personsviolating  the article in question  were  to be punishable  with death,or were to be treated as war criminals.  No such  stipulation figures in the Land Warfare Eegulations and it has seemed better to omitit.    Its  absence will not  in any way  prejudice  the  imposition of punishment on persons who  are guilty of breaches  of the laws ofnerial warfare.
APPENDIX  (P.).Conclusions of the 183rd Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on                              April 3, 1924. THE COMMITTEE agreed- 1.  To recommend that the Report of the Sub-Committee, to consider.the Report       of the International Commission on the Revision of the Laws of War,       which recommends &apos;       (a.)  That the rules for the control of radio in time of war, as embodied in              Part I of the Report  of the International Commission, should be              accepted;       (b.)  That the rules of Aerial  Warfare, as embodied in Part II of the              Report  of  the  International  Commission,  should   be  accepted,              subject to certain technical observations which  are set out in the              Sub-Committee&apos;s Report;       (c.)  That it is desirable that the  general Report of the Commission of              Jurists to consider and report upon the Revision of the Laws of              Warfare should be published;       (d.)  That His Majesty&apos;s Government be moved to approve the action taken              by Sir Rennell Rodd and Sir Cecil Hurst in the important question              of visit and search of merchant vessels by aircraft, and in the              general  conduct of  the negotiations, and  that  an expression of              thanks of His Majesty&apos;s Government should  be  conveyed to them;       should be approved by  His Majesty&apos;s Government. 2.  In connection with Conclusion (1)  (b) above to draw  particular attention to       the question of visit and search of merchant shipping by aircraft, which       is of great importance  to the  British Empire.  The  Committee also draw       attention to the strong view of the Admiralty that the British repre-       sentatives at any International Conference on this subject should, in the       first instance, press for a prohibition of attack on merchant vessels by       aircraft, and that only if prohibition is  not accepted by the other Powers       represented, do the Admiralty agree to the recommendation  contained in       the following extract from the Sub-Committee&apos;s  Report:        &quot; Visit and Search of Merchant Shipping by Aircraft.            &quot;The  Sub-Committee note that the International  Commission were       unable to agree upon an Article dealing with the exercise of belligerent       rights by aircraft  against merchant vessels, although all the Delegations       of all the  Powers represented on the Commission concurred in  the       expression  of  a  desire  to   adopt  such  rules  as  would  assure  the       observance or the dictates of humanity  as regards the protection of the       lives of neutrals and non-combatants.            &quot;The  Sub-Committee recommend that at any  future International       Conference which  may be held dealing with the subject of  the Rules of       Aerial Warfare, His Majesty&apos;s Government should press for the inclusion       of an Article  regarding  the right of visit  and  search of  Merchant       Shipping by Aircraft,  and that such an Article  should follow the text       put  forward by the  American Delegation to late  Commission  at  The       Hague, and which read as follows :                 &quot;Aircraft are forbidden to visit and search surface  or  sub-           surface vessels without  conforming in all respects to  the rules  to           which  surface vessels  authorised to conduct visit and search are           subject.              .  &quot; In view of  the  irregularities to which  the use of aircraft           against merchant vessels  might give rise,  it is declared that aircraft           cannot divert a merchant  vessel from its course without first boarding  [1.1636-2&apos;]                                               ;i    B 2
          it; that in no event may an aircraft destroy a merchant vessel unless          the crew and passengers of such vessels have first been placed in          safety;  and that if an aircraft cannot capture a merchant vessel in          conformity  with these rules it must  desist from attack and  from          seizure and  permit such vessel to proceed unmolested.&quot;3.  To recommend  that before any communication is  made by  His Majesty&apos;s      Government to foreign Powers with regard to the general Eeport of the      Commission of Jurists, the Governments  of the Dominions and India      should be informed of the decisions which had been arrived at by His      Majesty&apos;s Government  and  invited  to express their  Views  on  such      decisions.
APPENDIX (C).REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THE REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL.             COMMISSION ON THE REVISION OF THE LAWS OF WAR.    1.  AT their 181st Meeting, held on the 11th February, 1924, the Committee ofImperial Defence recommended     That,  in the first instance, the General Report of the International Commis-        sion of Jurists, held at The Hague in  1923, to consider and  report upon        the revision of the Rules of Warfare (OLD. Paper No. 418-B), should be        referred for consideration by a Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of        Lord Haldane, on which the Foreign  Office,  Admiralty, War Office,  Air        Ministry and Colonial Office should be  represented.    2.  The following  were appointed Members  of  the Sub-Committee  of  theCommittee of Imperial Defence :-                                Chairman:            The Right Hon. Viscount Haldane of Cloan, K.T., O.M.    Foreign Office.                Members:        Sir Cecil Hurst, K.C.B:, K.C., Legal Adviser.    Admiralty.        Captain J. C.

The  Sub-Committee  having considered the Report  of  the international commission on the  Revision  of  the  Laws  of  War (C.I.D. Paper No. 418-B),together with the  observations by the Air Council and the Army Council on theReport (C.I.D.  Papers Nos. 426-B  and  435-B  respectively), put  forward thefollowing recommendations for consideration  by- the  Committee  of ImperialDefence:     1.  That the &quot; Rules for the Control of  Radio in Time of War,&quot; as embodied inPart I of  the Report of the International Commission, should be accepted.      [11636-3]
    2. That the &quot; Rules of Aerial Warfare,&quot; as embodied in Part II of the Reportof the International Commission, should  be accepted,  subject to the following observations, which deal with specific articles in the  Code and with the questionof the right of visit and search of merchant vessels by aircraft: (a.)\ Article V--Classification of Aircraft.    To be accepted in its present form.(b.) Article XVITl. &quot;Use of Tracer, Incendiary or Explosive Projectiles by or against       Aircraft.    Tq,be aQaept^edar^ itsjpresent form,,r     , ,,,,,  ,   tv j, ;    .  hm  , ,,    The Sub-Committee recommend that note should,be taken of the faGtjtbat it           might occasionally prove  impossible for ground troops to avoid using           tracer, incendiary or explosive projectiles against, ground  tropps owing           to  the, difficulty qf, changing one form  of  ammunition for  another in           the course of an action.(c.) Article XXIV&apos;.^-Bombardment.    To be accepted in its present form.                  &apos; -    The Sub-Committee  recommend that,  in  view of  the latitude with which          Article XXIV might be interpreted by different Powers, the adoption of          this article  would not justify us  in neglecting to  take precautions in          regard to anti-aircraft defences.(d.) Article XXVI. -Protection of Historic Monuments.    To be accepted in its present form.(e.) Article XLVI. Supply of Aircraft by Contractors of Neutral Nationality.    To be accepted.    The  Sub-Committee  recommend, however, that the  limiting words &quot; if - there          is reason to believe,&quot; which occur at the conclusion of paragraph 1 of          the Article, should also be introduced into paragraphs 2  and 3 respec-          tively of the  Article.(f.) Visit and Search of Merchant Shipping by Aircraft.    The  Sub-Committee note that the International Commission were unable to          agree upon an Article dealing with  the exercise of belligerent, rights          by  aircraft against merchant vessels, although, all  the Delegations of          all  the  Powers  represented  on  the  Commission  concurred , in   the          expression, of  a desire to adopt such  rules,-as  would ^assure  the           observance of the dictates of humanity as regards the protection of  the          lives of neutrals and non-combatants.             .  -V a  y *..  ;\:    The  Sub-Committee recommend that at any future International Conference          which may be held  dealing with  the subject of the Rules of Aerial          Warfare, His  Majesty&apos;s Government should  press for the inclusion          of,.an Article. regarding  the right of.  visit and search,of,Merchant          Shipping by  Aircraft, and  that such an  Article (should follow, the text          put forward  by the American Delegation to late Commission  at The          Hague, and which read as follows :                    &quot; Aircraft are forbidden to  visit and search  surface or sub-               surface vessels without conforming in all  respects to  the  rules to               which surface vessels  authorised to conduct visit and  search  are               subject.                   ,&quot;In view of:  the  irregularities to which the use  of aircraft               against  merchant ,vessels might give  pise, it  is  declared. that               aircraft cannot divert a, merchant vessel from  its, pourse without               first boarding,.it:; that  in   no  event  may an  aircraft  destroy               a,merchant vessel unless the crew and passengers of  such vessels               have first been&apos;placed in  safety; and  that if an aircraft,.cannot               capture  a merchant vessel in conformity with  these rules  it must               desist from attack and from seizure  and permit such vessel to               proceed unmolested.&quot;
    2. That the &quot;Rules of Aerial Warfare,&quot; as embodied in Part II of the Reportof the International Commission, should  be accepted,  subject to the following observations, which deal with specific  articles in the Code and with the questionof the right of visit and search of merchant vessels by aircraft: (a.)r Article V.-Classification of Aircraft.

Tq,beaqaeptjed;ini itSjppesent form,,.  ......,,,,  ,,,, tv j.     .       ,    The Sub-Committee recommend that note should,be taken of  tjlre fapt. jthat it           might occasionally prove impossible for ground troops to avoid using           tracer, incendiary or explosive projectiles, against iground  tropps owing           to  the,difficulty qf. changing one  form  of ammunition for another in           the course of  an action.(c.) Article XXIV.^-Bombardment.    To be accepted in its present form.    The Sub-Committee recommend  that, in  view of  the  latitude with which           Article XXIV might be interpreted by different Powers,  the adoption of           this article would not justify us  in neglecting to take precautions in           regard to anti-aircraft defences.(d.) Article XXVI-Protection of Historic Monuments.    To be accepted in its present form.(e.) Article XLVI. Supply of Aircraft by Contractors of Neutral Nationality.    To be accepted.    The Sub-Committee  recommend,  however, that the  limiting words &quot;il there           is reason to believe,&quot; which occur at the conclusion of paragraph 1 of           the Article, should also be  introduced into  paragraphs 2  and 3 respec-           tively of the Article.(f.) Visit and Search of Merchant Shipping by Aircraft.    The Sub-Committee note that the International Commission were unable to           agree upon an Article dealing with  the exercise  of belligerent rights           by  airpraft against merchant vessels, aljiliough,all the  Delegations of           all  the  Powers  represented  on the  Commission concurred  in  the           expression, of  a  desire  to adopt; such ,rules,;as would assure  the           observance of the dictates of humanity as regards the protection of  the           lives of neutrals and non-combatants.                   . ..-    The Sub-Committee recommend that at any future International Conference           which may be held  dealing with  the subject of  the Rules of Aerial           Warfare, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government should press  for. the  inclusion           of,.an Article, -regarding the  right qf.  visit and  search , of., Merchant           Shipping by Aircraft, and that such an  Article (should follow the text           put forward by the American  Delegation to late  Commission at The           Hague, and which read as follows :                    &quot;Aircraft are forbidden to visit and search  surface  or sub-               surface vessels without conforming  in all  respects to the rules to               which surface vessels  authorised to conduct visit and search  are               subject.                   &quot; In  view of  the  irregularities to  which the  use of, aircraft               against  merchant . vessels  might give  rise, it , is declared. that               aircraft cannot divert a. merchant vessel  from its,  pourse without               first :boarding it.; that  in no ,event  may an  aircraft  destroy               a,merchant vessel unless the crew and  passengers  of such vessels               have first  been&quot;placed  in safety; and  that if an aircraft, cannot               capture a merchant vessel in conformity with  these rules it must               desist from attack and  from  seizure and permit  such vessel to               proceed unmolested.&quot;
324    The Sub-Committee call attention to the fact  :.    That in view of the possibility of the violation of this rule by an unscrupulous          enemy the adoption  of this article would not, in their opinion,, justify          us in neglecting to take any necessary steps to  further developments          in connection with the protection of our trade routes against aerial          attack.    3.  That it is desirable that the General Report of  the Commission of Juriststo consider and report upon  the Revision of the Laws of Warfare  should  bepublished.    4.  That His Majesty&apos;s Government be moved to approve the action taken  bySir Rennell Rodd and Sir Cecil  Hurst in the important question of visit and search  of merchant vessels by aircraft and  in the general conduct of the negotia-tions, and that an expression of thanks of His Majesty&apos;s Government  should  be conveyed to them.
