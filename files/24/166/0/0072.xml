                                                 q 1&apos;&apos;  WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY AMD SIGNALLING BILL.     The object of the present Bill is to make permanent and to amend the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1904,,   The Aotof 1904- was regarded as cf an experimental character and was limited in duration.   It has bean extended fromtime to time by the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, and,unless further extended, comes to an end,on the 31stDecember next.   It has been felt for a long time thatthe act should he amended in csrtain particulars and made permanent&apos;, and a Bill on the general lines of thepresent Bill passed the Committee stage in the Houseof Commons in 19S3,  but was then dropped owing to the dissolution.     The Act of 1904 was necessary because the PostmasterGeneral&apos;s powers of control under his ordinary telegraphmonopoly do not extend to wireless stations intended for communication outside this country, or to wireless stations intended for communication of a purely privatecharacter (e.g. between the different branches of thesame firm)0    Such powers of control were necessary,first from a strategic point of view,  and secondly  vbecause,.in the absence cf control, chaos would inevitablyhave resulted owing to the interference of one stationwith another.    All civilised nations have found itnecessary to exercise such control, and in some countries the control is much more stringent than  ;here.     The principal amendments of the original  Act includedin the present Bill are as followsj-      (l) Certain, points of doubt which have     arisen under the principal Act are removed.                                         These
Cl. 4 (1)ciai (2)                                                           K 7 $               These relate to the questions (a)  whether               the maintenance1 of a wireless station               without the Postmaster General&apos;s lioence,               as distinct from its installation  or use,               is an offence;  (b) whether a licence is               necessary for a reoeiving station  as               distinct from a transmitting station;  and               (c) whether the Postmaster General has               power to charge a reasonable fee to coverCl. 5          expenses in connection with the  grant of               experimental licences.    The Postmaster               General has been proceeding in the past on               the assumption  that he has these powers               under,the original Act,  and he is  advised               that he has proceeded correctly, but these               is a certain element of doubt in each case               whioh  it  is  desirable to  remove.&apos;  This is               particularly important as regards  the               necessity of a  lioence for a receiving station,               as the broadcasting scheme as a  whole depends               upon the Postmaster General1s powers in this               respect.Cl.  2,     (2) The provisions of the principal Aotregarding ships are   extended to aircraft.                    (3)  The provisions of  the principal Act               are  extended to  the  installation and workingCl, 9.         of apparatus for the wireless transmission of               energy as distinct from messages.   This is               necessary because the  same  interference results               whatever  may be  the  purpose for which the                                                  etherio
                                             &apos;.etherio waves are used.   This amendment hasbeen discussed with representatives of theRailway Companies and with the ElectricityCommiasioners, and has been agreed to by then,     (4) Penalties are imposed for thegeliding of false or misleading signals of distress;  for the improper divulging of wireless messages overheard by persons for whom they are not intended;  and for the transmission of indecent or offensive messagesor messages &quot;subversive of public order&quot;,It JiB right to mention that there was practically no controversy during theCommittee stage of the Bill of 1922 exceptupon the latter provision,,     (S) Provision is made for simplifyingthe arrangements for more stringent control incase of national emergency.    The PostmasterGeneral is given power in such an event tomake ouch rules as he may consider necessary with regard to the possession and. sale of apparatus, as well as its installation and use,     (6) An amendment, giving the PostnssterGeneral power to accept compromise fines inoases of minor default as an alternative toprosecution.   This has been made at thesuggestion of the Broadcasting Committee oflast yean, in order to facilitate thetreatment of cases of evasion of licences inconnection with the broadcasting scheme.                                    (7)
     (7)  At tha suggestion of the admiralty the provisions of the principal Act have been extended to visual or sound signalling stations(other than lloyd signalling stations orstations under the control of the Board ofTrade or Lighthouse Authorities) used or intended to he used for the purpose ofcommunication with ships at sea..   The object is to prevent the establishment of illicitstations of this description whioh might beused for the purpose of communication withthe enemy in case of war.                            V.
