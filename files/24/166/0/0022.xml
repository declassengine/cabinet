V)          Memorandum  by   the  Minister  of  Labour.1.831 (Si).           I circulate herewith for the consideration  of my      colleagues a draft of the Hours of industrial Employmont      Bill.           As I have already announced, it  is based, upon the1      Washington Hours convention, and its  passage would enableI      the Government to ratify that Convention.I           The Bill has, however, been so drawn  that amendments,      not consistent with  the terms of the  Convention,  would  comeI      within the scope of  the Bill and could be  accepted if      necessary without wrecking  the Bill as a whole,  though,  of1      course, the acceptance of such amendments  would  preclude       formal  ratification,IMinistry of Labour.28th March, 1924.(intd.)
