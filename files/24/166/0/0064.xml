[This  Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]    c,,&apos;0. jPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1924.SECRET.CP. 264  (24).                                CABINET.POLICY  IN  IRAQ.        MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    I  CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum, whichwas prepared for me in the Colonial  Office in February last, on  the subject  ofpolicy in Iraq.    The situation, as described in paragraph 7 of the memorandum, has developedfurther since the memorandum was written.  The Agreements subsidiary to theTreaty of October 1922  have  now been signed.   The Iraq Constituent assembly is  actually  in  session, and is discussing the Treaty, Protocol  and  SubsidiaryAgreements, its  &quot; acceptance&quot;  of which  is (under Article 18 of the  Treaty) -acondition precedent to ratification.  It  is  to be  anticipated  that, within a fewweeks time, we may learn  that  the instruments have been  &quot; accepted&quot; by theAssembly.    The question will then arise whether we are to proceed to ratification.- I donot myself  see that we have any alternative; but  the point  is one on which Ithink  it necessary to obtain a formal decision from, the Cabinet.    I  would call attention  in this connection to the language used  by the PrimeMinister in the House of Commons ou the 20th February last.  In the first placehe gave an undertaking that &quot; the Treaty with  King Feisal, with the Protocol  ofApril  1928  and subsidiary  agreements,  will be  submitted to the House beforeratification.&quot;   Subsequently, in  reply  to  a  Supplementary Question  (asking whether it was intended that ratification should be &quot; put forward with the full support of His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;), the Prime  Minister replied : &quot; Certainly..This is one  of our inheritances, which we shall carry out.&quot;    In all the  circumstances I submit vl) that the Cabinet should uow decide  inprinciple in favour of  ratifying  the  Treaty and  connected instruments; and(2) that, as  soon as the &quot; acceptance &quot; of  the Iraq  Assembly has been recorded, anopportunity should be given for discussion of the whole question in  the House ofCommons prior to the actual exchange of ratifications.  I propose, if my colleagues agree, to publish the text  of the Protocol and the &quot;Subsidiary Agreements&quot;&apos;forthwith as a Parliamentary Paper.  Meanwhile  I am circulating advance proofscontaining the text of these documents for the information of the Cabinet.  the text of the  Treaty of 1922 has already been published.    There is a further point.  Among the  subsidiary agreements is  one laying-down  the conditions of service for British officers  under the Iraq  .Government..If this agreement is ratified, the  question of the  proposed &quot; Guarantee Bill,&quot;  towhich reference is made in paragraph 15 of the Departmental Memorandum below,will at once arise.  For the reasons given in the memorandum, I am  satisfied that legislation on the lines proposed is necessary, if the policy which I am inviting theCabinet to adopt is to be successfully carried out.  Success depends on our getting the right stamp of  British  officer; and we shall not get him except on conditionsof reasonable security.   The financial risk seems to me to be one that we are fairlyentitled to  take.  I suggest that the principle  of the Guarantee Bill  should  beaccepted by the Cabinet, and that the  Treasury  and Colonial  Office  should  beauthorised to proceed with  the preparation of the draft Bill.      [11490]                                                       B39O 1/
    I would observe that the above proposals are made on the assumption thatthe Iraq Assembly will accept the  Treaty, &amp;c.  If they do not, an entirely new situation will  arise, and I shall be  prepared  in that event to submit  alternative proposals for the consideration of my colleagues.  .  To sum up, I recommend:     1. That the Cabinet should agree in principle to  ratify the Treaty, Protocol          and Subsidiary Agreements ;    2. That, as soon as the Iraq Assembly  has  &quot;accepted&quot; the Treaty, &amp;c, an          opportunity  should  be  given to  Parliament to discuss  the whole          question,  prior to the  exchange  of  ratifications, and  that, in  the          meantime,  the text  of the  Protocol and Agreements  should  be          published as a Parliamentary Paper;  and    3. That the principle of the proposed &quot; Guarantee  Bill &quot; should be accepted,          the  preparation  of  the  draft  Bill  being   left  to  the Departments          concerned.                                                                   J  H T    Colonial Office, April 16, 1924.                            British Policy in Iraq,    The country now known officially as Iraq covers the  area which comprisedbefore the war the three Turkish &quot; vilayets,&quot; or provinces, of Mosul, Baghdad andBasrah.  It extends from the hill country north of Mosul (the ancient Nineveh)southwards to  the head of the Persian Gulf, a distance of some 550 miles.  it contains the whole basin  of  the  lower Euphrates and Tigris,  which  unite atKhurna, about  100 miles from the sea.  Hence its classical name  of Mesopotamia(the land  between the rivers).  The population of  the  Baghdad  and  Basrahvilayets is  almost entirely Arab; that of the Mosul Vilayet is also largely Arab, butthere is a considerable mixture of other elements.  The hill  country to the northand east of the vilayet is predominantly Kurdish.  It forms a screen,  separatingthe rest of the vilayet from Turkey to the north and Persia to the east.  Politically,the whole  country was Turkish before the war.  The total population is estimatedat about 2f millions.  The  vast  majority are Mohammedans,  divided  in fairlyequal proportions between the two sects of Sunnis and Shiahs.    2.  The entry of Turkey into the war made it necessary to send an expeditionaryforce to Basrah.   We could not abandon without a struggle our 100 years&apos; pre-dominance in the Persian Gulf; nor could we,  for strategic reasons, allow the headof the Gulf to remain in hostile occupation.  Had we done so, the Gulf might havebeen converted  into an enemy lake, with hostile submarine bases, &amp;c.  The effect upon  our.  communications with India would have been disastrous.  A furtherconsideration was  the need to  protect the Persian oil-fields (nothing to  do  withMosul oil),  which are  connected by a pipe-line with the head of the Gulf. Theseoil-fields were of great value  to  the Navy during the war, as affording our shipsregular access to an ample supply of oil in Eastern waters.    3.  Whether the  above considerations  necessitated  an  advance beyond  theBasrah  Vilayet may  be open to dispute.   In war it is never easy,  and may beperilous, to sit still.   At any rate, we did not  sit still.   The end of the war foundus in occupation of practically the whole of the area covered by the three TurkishVilayets of Basrah, Baghdad and Mosul.  In the course  of the campaign we had given various pledges, undertakings, &amp;c, to the local Arabs.   We told the persian gulf Sheikhs early in the proceedings that Basrah would never be allowed to revert to Turkish authority. Later, we told the people of  Basrah  that they might lookfoward to  &quot; a more benign administration &quot; in future.  On occupying Baghdad(March  1917)  we  proclaimed that  we had  come not as conquerors,  but  as&quot; liberators,&quot; and  invited  the inhabitants to  co-operate with us in our task, sothat they might be united with their kinsmen abroad in &quot; realising the aspirations of their race.&quot;   Meanwhile, in October 1915, Sir H. McMahon had made his famouspromise to  the Sherif  of Mecca (now King Hussein of the  liejaz) that we would recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within defined geographicallimits..   These  limits included the  whole  of Iraq,  though we made  specialreservations in respect of established  British interests in the latter.
    i.  For about two years after the armistice we governed Iraq on-what has been called the Indian model.  That is to say, we set up what was in effect direct british administration.  The experiment, supported as it  was by overwhelming military strength, seemed for a time to be working well.  It  broke down  in  the summer of1920, when a local rising on the Euphrates developed into a serious rebellion, whichwas put down with much difficulty with the aid of reinforcements sent from India.As to the cause of this outbreak, opinion is not unanimous. It may or may not havebeen due, as was freely alleged at the time, to discontent with direct British rule and delay in the fulfilment of war-time promises of independence.  At any rate, it hadthe effect of directing public interest upon the  Iraq question and  of causing theBritish Cabinet to modify their policy.    5.  Sir Percy  Cox, who had served in the  Expeditionary Force  as ChiefPolitical Officer, was appointed High Commissioner in  the autumn  of 1920.  InMarch  1921 the control of all Middle Eastern  areas was  concentrated in  a single department, viz., the Colonial Office.  The newly appointed Secretary of State forthe Colonies  iMr. Churchill)  proceeded  to Cairo  in  March  1921, where  he hadsummoned a conference of all  the principal officers engaged in administering theMiddle East.  The upshot, so far as Iraq was concerned, was that the  Emir Faisal,a son of the King of the Hejaz, was invited to proceed to Baghdad as a candidate for the throne  of Iraq.&apos;   His candidature was successful, and he was crowned at baghdad on the 23rd August, 1921.  A native ministry had been appointed by theHigh Commissioner before the King&apos;s arrival, and  the new regime was introducedwithout difficulty.   Direct  British administration was replaced by a system underwhich the functions of British  officers ceased to be executive and became advisory.    6.  Our legal  position  in Iraq  rested in  the  first instance ou  the  right ofconquest.  Since April 1920 it has been based on the action of the Principal AlliedPowers, who, at the  San Rei.no Conference, invited  His Britannic  Majesty toassume the position of Mandatory for Iraq under the League of Nations.   Iraq, itmay be observed, falls under the  definition given in article 22 of the Covenant ofthe League of Nations, of &quot; certain communities, formerly belonging to the turkish empire &quot;. whose independence is to be  provisionally recognised,  subject to theadministrative advice and assistance of  a Mandatory, until they can stand alone.The terms of the Mandate under  which this advice and assistance are to be rendered are  subject to the approval of the League.  A draft  Mandate  for Iraqwas submitted to the League in December 1920.   Owing to various difficulties,mainly arising out of the attitude of the United States, the  draft  has never been formally  approved, though in  October 1921 we obtained a  kind  of  ad interimauthority  from  the &quot;League in the shape of a letter from  the President of itsCouncil, inviting  us to  continue to carry on the  administration  of Iraq in thespirit of the  draft  mandate until such  time as the position should have beenregularised.   In  the meantime  Iraq,  under our guidance, has advanced  rapidlyalong the path indicated in the Covenant.  Provisional recognition of independencehas been transformed into something like absolute recognition.   In October 1922,having previously notified the League of our intentions, we embodied our relationswith the Iraq. Government in  the form of a  Treaty of Alliance, concluded asbetween  equals.  It is now proposed, when the  moment arrives, to  invite theLeague to accept the treaty in  substitution for the  draft  mandate.    7.  The Treaty  of  October 1922 was signed shortly before the  fall  of  the coalition  Government.   It provided  for the continuance of British advice  and assistance (on conditions to be laid down in detail  in subsidiary agreements) for aperiod  of twenty years.  After the change of  Government in England it wasdecided to reduce  the period to four years.  Effect was given to this decision by a protocol signed at Baghdad in April 1923.  Since the signature of the protocol the subsidiary agreements  have been  under  active  negotiation.   They  are nowpractically complete.  Meanwhile, under a somewhat complicated electoral system a  Constituent Assembly has been getting itself elected in Iraq.  It  is expected to assemble at Baghdad early in  March.   Its first business will be to accept theTreaty and subsidiary Agreements, and to pass the  Organic Law of  Iraq, the termsof which have already been settled between ourselves and the Iraq Government.    8.  Another important change introduced bv Mr. Churchill  was  the  transfer(October 1922) of military control in Iraq from the  War Office to the Air Ministry.Under  the system of air control the strength of  the British garrison  in Iraq, andconsequently  the cost of the country to the British taxpayer, has been very rapidlyreduced.   The garrison is now down to four infantry battalions (three Indian and       [11490J                                                      B 2
one British), in addition to R.A.F. personnel, while expenditure from the british exchequer, which totalled 32 millions in 1920-21, fell to 23 millions in 1921-22, to millions in 1922-23, to 7 millions in 1923-24, and to 5-1 millions i estimate)  for1924-25.  Further progressive reductions are contemplated during the four  yearsof the Treaty period (which dates from the ratification of the  Peace  Treaty with turkey, and therefore has not yet  actually started), by the end of  which time thetroops will have disappeared and British expenditure ou the defence  of  Iraq willhave  come to an end.    9. It is right to add, as a, further testimony to the efficiency of air control, thatthese great reductions have been effected  without any serious disturbance of thelocal  situation; and this, despite  the fact that  peace  with Turkey,  on  the  earlyconclusion of which  all the calculations  of  1921 were based, did not become anaccomplished fact until the 24th July, 1923, and even now has left the question ofthe Turco-Iraq frontier unsettled.   One drawback  to  the system  has  beenillustrated during the last few weeks.   Iraq  is a country of which the settledareas are fringed by an  outlying belt  inhabited by unruly tribes and Beduin.  Tokeep the latter in order something beyond ordinary police action is required fromtime to time.   When further steps are necessary it is the R.A.F. that has to take them.  In most cases a demonstration is sufficient.  But if it proves insufficient,and if more active  measures  have  to  be  applied,  the R.A.F. cannot proceed,whatever precautions are taken (and it is quite  clear that all possible precautionsare taken), except by methods that are necessarily somewhat indiscriminate.  It isnot that air action causes more casualties than  action  by ground forces; probably the reverse is the case.  But it offers a wider surface to ill-informed criticism, andis  more  apt to create  incidents which lend themselves to press agitation and parliamentary  attack.  This is  a  drawback  inherent  in a  system of  air control.As against  it must be placed the strikingly successful results that have  been achieved.    10. The most important question still outstanding in regard to  Iraq is thesettlement of  the Northern frontier, i.e., the  Turco-Iraq  boundary.  Under theTreaty  of  Lausanne the  question  was  left over  for &quot;friendly  arrangement&quot;between  Turkey and Great Britain within nine months,  with a  subsequentreference  (if no agreement had been reached) to the  Council of the League ofNations.  We regard the  nine  months as having begun with a  communicationaddressed to the Turkish Government in October 1923, but active  negotiations have  not  yet  started.  Their outcome is very dubious.  The  Turks at the firstLausanne Conference claimed the whole of the  Mosul Vilayet, and were not to  be moved from  their position by all the powerful  and  closely reasoned argumentsbrought to bear upon them by Lord Curzon.  Our own attitude has always  beenthat, while ready to consider minor rectifications  at this  point or that, we mustmaintain  in substance the present administrative  boundary, which  coincidespretty closely with  the pre-war boundary- of the Mosul Vilayet.  How far theTurks, when we get to grips  with them, will  adhere to their  extreme claimsremains to be seen.    11. The frontier question is bound up with that of the  Assyrians, a scatteredremnant of an ancient Christian community who  took  the Allied side during thewar and, as  a consequence, were driven out  of their ancestral homes.   We  havea, plan for settling these people in the northern  frontier, districts of Iraq, undera  loose form of relationship to the Irak State; but the success  of this  plandepends on our obtaining  a frontier which will exclude from Turkey the area  inwhich it is  proposed to settle the Assyrians.   The retrocession  of the whole ofthe Mosul Vilayet, or even  of a  substantial part  of it, would seriously affect the prestige and stability of the Iraq  State.   It might even make FeisaFs positionimpossible and bring the whole of our Iraq policy to the ground.  The questionof  the Mosul oil-fields is  also involved to the extent that, if the Mosul Vilayet isreturned to the Turks, the oil-fields (the value of which is quite  conjectural)would, of  course, pass wholly out of our control.  The point is one that must be mentioned in this  connection.  It is not suggested that it can, or ought to be,regarded as a  determining consideration. There are also strategical questions involved.  To restore the  Mosul Vilayet  to  the  Turks would  bring them withinstriking distance of Baghdad, and, apart  from the blow to King FeisaPs prestige,would, in  the opinion of high military authority, make his  position untenable on military grounds.    12. It may well  be  asked, what good  does  the British nation  or the BritishEmpire get out of all this ?  If we are to leave Iraq in any case four years hence,
why not leave  at  once and have  done with it?   The short answer is that if weleave now the  Iraq State will inevitably collapse, the country will be reduced toanarchy, and in due  course the  Turk will return.  Even the four years of the protocol of 1923 is an exceedingly short period in which to nurse Iraq through itsnonage and set  it upon its  own feet as a self-reliant State.   At best  it is something of a gamble; but thei*e are at least good chances of a successful issue.We have during the  last three years  reduced the whole question to manageableproportions.  The intolerable  financial  burden of three years ago has now been converted  into  a  comparatively small (the  word comparatively is  emphasised) anddiminishing annual charge which will disappear altogether in four years time.  our national credit is  deeply involved  in the successful issue of our policy.  We couldnot abandon the  task now, and  leave  our friends and supporters to  their fate,without exposing  ourselves to the  charge of  a glaring breach of faith.  The spectacleof the great British Empire repudiating its  obligations, when  almost within  sight of their final liquidation, would create a lamentable impression all over the world.It could not fail to react to our disadvantage in India  and Egypt.   We  cannot, itis submitted, afford to scuttle the ship within a few miles  of port.    13. There is also  a more positive  side to the question. The Protocol of April1923, which limited the Treaty period to four*years, also provided for the conclusionbefore the  end of  that period of  a fresh agreement &quot; to regulate  the subsequentrelations between the High Contracting Parties.&quot;  In this connection the  following extract may be quoted from the Report (dated the 23rd March,  1923) of the CabinetCommittee appointed by the late Government: &quot; AVe anticipate that, althoughthe mandatory relations of Great  Britain with Iraq and the financial  liabilities ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government will have terminated within the stated period, it willbe the desire both of King Peisal  and  the people of Iraq that the special  relationsexisting between  Great Britain  and  the  Arab  Kingdom shall not  be abruptlyterminated, but that an agreement will be capable of conclusion between the twoGovernments  .... which may admit of British assistance being given to the arab state, at no cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government, with a view to the development ofits  resources and the stability of its administration.  In such  an arrangementspecial provision for the maintenance of British interests,  including those relatingto the port of Basrah and facilities for Imperial air  routes, may profitably beincluded.&quot;    Iraq, from its geographical situation  between Turkey, Arabia and Persia, maybe regarded as  a  key position in the Mohammedan world.   The existence of a stable Arab State, bound by  special  ties  of friendship  and gratitude  to GreatBritain, and breaking the chain of possibly hostile influences, may be of  immenseimportance to  us in  the  difficult times that lie before  us.  A minor,  but stillimportant point, is that Baghdad  is regarded as a vital stage in the air route toIndia and the East.    14. On the economic  side, the  case  is perhaps  less  easy to  establish.  the popular view that Iraq is a mere  arid  desert is far removed  from the truth.  Inancient times  the country  was  one  of the granaries of  the world.   The oldirrigation  system  (though traces  of  it are  still to  be seen)  has  long sincedisappeared.  Until it is  replaced, the  country will  not regain its  prosperity.Irrigation is its vital need; but irrigation costs money, which in these days is verydifficult to find.   But that the country will repay development cannot be doubted.Development means foreign enterprise, and it is clearly to the advantage  of thiscountry that such enterprise should be retained in British hands.    15. It is quite clear that the Iraq Government itself looks forward to retainingBritish advice  and assistance even  after.the Treaty period comes  to  an end.  Itis already in negotiation to obtain the services  of British administrative adviserson  long-term contracts, running,  in some cases, to a period of fifteen years.  Theterms and conditions under which these officers are to be engaged will be regulated by  one of the  Agreements subsidiary to the Iraq Treaty, of which mention hasalready been made.   Their employment is an essential feature of our whole policyand a guarantee of the continued maintenance of British influence in Iraq afterthe. termination of the Treaty.  If officers  of the  right  stamp are to be obtained,they must have reasonable security of tenure.  The plan  proposed, and approved in principle by the late Government, was that  the due  fulfilment by  the IraqGovernment of the terms of contract should be guaranteed  by the Secretary ofState.  But such a  guarantee cannot be  given without  specific  authority from parliament.  That is the meaning of the  draft Bill,  regarding which a separate
submission was recently made.  The terms of the Bill have been carefully worked out in consultation with the Treasury, whose  suggestions  have been embodied inthe latest version of the draft.   The proposed  guarantee involves  a maximumcontingent liability estimated at 570,OOOL, of which it is not anticipated that anypart will actually become payable.  In any event, the amount of the contingent liability will decrease progressively each  year  that  the  Iraq Government remains in existence and continues to fulfil its obligations.  In ten years  it is calculated that the total liability will have been  reduced to 100,000 ., and in fifteen years itwill have disappeared altogether.   Unless there is to  be complete reversal ofpolicy in Iraq,  it is essential that the  necessary powers to cover  the proposed guarantee should be obtained from Parliament with the least possible delay.  Anearly decision, authorising action on the  lines  proposed, is urgently&apos; required.    16. The general situation in  Iraq  at the  present time is described  in  some detail in the recent despatch from the High Commissioner,  which is now undercirculation to the Cabinet.   His account is on the whole a very favourable one.  hia recent telegram (the 2nd February,  1924) Sir  H. Dobbs  reported as follows :-&quot; The country is now exceedingly peaceful, and I  myself  and the British  advisers and inspectors are working in  complete harmony  with the Iraq Government and people.&quot;  Considering the difficulties that have had to  be overcome, the presentsituation may fairly be regarded with  satisfaction.   But  we must guard against taking too sanguine a view.  There are many difficulties still to be faced.  We donot know what will be the  attitude of the Constituent Assembly when elected.We cannot count with entire confidence  on FeisaFs  power (or perhaps even hiswill) to resist the demands of the more extreme Arab &quot; nationalists.&quot;   There maybe more trouble with Beduin in the Euphrates area or with Kurds in the northernhighlands.  We have still to settle with the Turk.  There is  no use in idealisingthe Arabs, whether King or peasant, or in attributing to them qualities which theydo not possess.  The best of them are  shifty and  unreliable from  the  westernstandpoint.   We have to work with the material that lies to  hand, and shall gainnothing by pretending that it is better than it is.   But while making all allowances,it may fairly be claimed that we are engaged upon a worthy task, and are  in a fair-way to carry it through with success.
