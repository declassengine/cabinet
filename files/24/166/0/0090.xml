By the direction of the Prime Minister theaccompanying Memorandum is circulated to the cabinet for consideration at the next meeting.(Sd.)    M.P.A.

      MEASURES Qg THE NATIOEAL ASSEMBLY OF             THB QHimCH 61&apos; INLAND&apos;                    J g 7Mote circulated by direction of the Prlao Minister.     Under the Procedure initiated by the Church of EnglandAssembly  (Powers) Act 1919 there hare been presented to bothHouses of Parliament the following five Measures,         The Benefices Act, 1893  (Amendment) Measures, 1923,         The Unien of Benefices Measure, 1,923.         The Diocese of Winchester (Division) Measure, 1923.         The Dioceso of Southwell  (Division) Measure, 1923.         The Bishopric of Blackburn Measure, 1923.A brief note on the general purport of these Measures is annexed(Appendix 2).     The new method of legislation originated by the Church ofEngland Assembly  (Powers) Act, of ivhich these Measures are the outcome,&apos; is as follows:-  I Measure passed by the Church assembly which is confirmed by the Ecclesiastical Committee of Parliament(a body entirely independent of the Government) can be laid beforeParliament and a Resolution be proposed that it be presented toHis Majesty to  receive the Royal Assent,  Unless the resolution is defeated the Measure is BO presented and then has the forae ofa Statute.  No amendment of the Measure is permissible and parliament must either reject or accept it as a whole.     The Government is in no way represented on the EcclesiasticalCommittee and thus the only way in which it can enforce itsWishes against the wishes of the Church Assembly is by securingthe defeat of the Resolution on the Measure in Parliament  -amendment being excluded by the terms of the Church of EnglandAssembly (Powers) Act.   The Government cannot intervene torepresent its views at  an earlior stage since this  also  is excludedfrom the procedure laid down in the Powers Act:  and accordinglyif there were only one  Clause in the  Measure to  which  thej:Government were forced, to take objection it must reject  the  measure in toto.                                 -1-
1 p o     The scope of these Measures which Parliament cannot amend is defined in the words-of the Powers Act as follows:  &quot;A Measuremay relate to any matter concerning the Church of England,  andmay extend to the amendment or repeal in whole or in part ofany Act of Parliament-,.&quot;  These terms are alone sufficient toindicate the difficulties in which, if legislation by Measurescontinues unimpeded, the Government can be. placed by theactivities of the Church Assembly;  pn.go a Measure wherebypersons divorced according to Statue should be debarred fromCommunion, or a Measure on the subject of the Revision of thePrayer Book would inevitably place the Government in an embarrassing position,,     It is generally agreed by the respective Ministers whoexercise Crown Patronage that the present Measures need notbe resisted and that in regard to the two of then which- seek to deprive the Crown of certain proprietary rights, the king should be advised to place his proprietary rights at Parliament&apos;disposal.  It has, however, been suggested, with a view to avoiding the difficulties indicated in tho preceding paragraphwhich similar Measures may cause in the future, that theGovernment might toko the present opportunity, while acceptingthese five Measures, to announce that, while in respect of  these measures the House of Commons would be left free to take its owncourse, the Government would feel bound to ask Parliament to reject, if need arose, any Measure more substantially affectingthe relations of Church and State irrespective of general merits.It would be explained that by the Powers Act Parliament is  pre-cluded from giving a considered examination both  to the principles and details which such Measures deserve,  and. that the procedure which deprives Parliament of the power to amend cannot be sustained)                               -2-                                                  -Ji                !
when the Measures for which sanction is sought  are  of  suchfar-reaching character.     It will be seen from the Lord Chancellors minute of whicha copy is attached (Appendix I) that he is not  disposed to commend this course:  but it is thought that the Cabinet as  awhole should be apprised of the implications of these  Measuresbefore anj advice is tendered to the King in regard to them or a decision arrived at as to whether on this  occasion theGovernment will make any announcement of their  futureattitude towards this form of legislation.(Intd.)   C.P.D.May: .6th, 1924.*
                                                     *y r* o                APPJ^DIX  I .                        * * 0            IQaiOHAHDIM BY gin LORD OIL JIO^ILO?^Prime Ministerm.           Two separate questions arise upon these measures.  The first of these arises only under theBenefices Act 1898  (Amendment) Measure and the Unionof Benefices Measure.  The second arises on all fiveMeasures.     1.    The Benefices Act (Amendment) measure and the Union of Benefices Measure affect the proprietaryrights of the Crown as respects the patronage exercised by the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor,- the duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall.   The LordChancellor is peculiarly interested as he alone amongstthe four Ministers  concerned has the power by Statuteto sell benefices which are vested in him,      The questions arising here are whether theCrown should place  its proprietary rights at the disposalof Parliament, and, if so, when and in what form.      2.    The second question is whether the Government,-looking at the policy of the Measures, should support oroppose tfce resolutions to be moved for their adoptionin both Houses of Parliament, or whether they should stand neuter.      (l)   As regards the first question, very cogentarguments might be  adduced in favour of excepting theCrown as represented by the Lord Chancellor from those provisions of the Benefices Aot Measure which forbid&apos;a sale.  The power  to sell is vested in the Lord
 Chancellor by Statute, to be exercised not. for his own benefit  as in the cese of a private patron nor for any secular advantage, hut so that  the proceeds of any sale might be employed for the  augmentation of the benefices  sold.    The  policy of the Act appears to have been  considered deliberately by Parliament and the  Statute comprises  a list of the benefices  which may  be sold.     But it does  not appear  to  me that  it  would be desirable  for  the Crown to have  the  appearance of desiring to maintain a  privilege of  which private patrons are to be  dispossessed.     The Union of  Benefices  measure empowers the  Ecclesiasticel Commissioners to divert the  surplus income of  a Benefice when  united to the  support  of  other Benefices a   This .1s likely  to  affect the  Chancellor of the  Duchy  to a greater  degree than  the  Lord Chancellor inasmuch as the livings  in the  gift  of  the former Minister are  more valuable  than  those in the  gift of the  latter.     On this point also  I  do not think  that the Crown can  claim any exemption from  a disability  imposed upon the private.&apos;patron.     So* far  as the proprietary rights of the Crown are  concerned therefore  I  think that His Majesty should be advised  to place them at  the disposal of Parliament.A consent  would, be signified to e*cfc House when the measure is before  that House.    It will be  necessary, however,  that a formal submission should be made  to the King.   As the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor and the Chancellor of the Duchy are ail involved,  it would appear most appropriate  that the submission on  behalf of all three Ministers  should go forward through th^ Prime Minister-.
                                                          r; ^5 (2)   As regards  the  general policy  of the measures apart from their effect on  the Crown1s proprietary rights my view is that there is nothing in them which  would justify a hostile intervention by the Government.   The procedure set up under the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act, 1919, is in many respects inconvenient, is inconsistent with many well-founded constitutional doctrines and may in  the future lead to a grave conflict bety/een the  Government of the day and those who are fcrthe time being the dominant party In the Church Assembly.   but these facts and this anticipation would not  afford any reasonfor opposing these particular Measures which whether beneficialor mischievous in their effects are proposals of a nature which parliament must have contemplated as likely  to proceed on theChurch Assembly.   No action now taken and no course of inactionnow adopted can prejudice the rights of this Government upona future occasion, to oppose any particular  Measure if it should appear to them to be desirable to do so.    There is on the otherhand no reason why the Government, who have  not been consulted as to the framing of these Measures,  should adopt  them as theirown or endeavour to obtain the assent of  the House to them if thoHouse should appear reluctant to give it.    I should,  therefore,propose that each measure should be left  in  each House to be  putforward on the motion of whatever Member  of  the House  choosesto make himself responsible for it and that  the Government,  aaa Government, should abstain from taking  any part  in the matter,without expressing any approval or on the other hand enteringany caveat with regard to the future.     But although the Government will in  my  opinionbe well advised to abstain from expressing any official viewupon any of these measures, a duty appears to me to rest upon themto see that an opportunity is afforded for their discussion if any member of either House should desire to express a view  upon                                -6-
1*1 H(iany of thenu   It is within the power of the ChurchAssembly under the Enabling Act to include in a measureprovisions of the most far-reaching character, repealingexisting Acts of Parliament affecting the rights of private individuals or of large classes of the community, touchingthe consciences and the rights to worship of large bodies of His Majesty1s subjects, subverting the Reformationsettlement, altering the relations of Church and State,threatening the existence of the Establishment, and even  ,upon a possible view modifying succession to the throne.Provisions of this nature may be so expressed as to escapeobservations except upon minute examination by experts.The debates in the Church Assembly may escape notice or theresult of thorn may be obscure;  the proceedings of thelegislative Committee and of the Ecclesiastical Committeetake place in private.   It may thus happen, unless full opportunity is given for examination and debate in both Housesthat large alterations in the law may be made without theknowledge of Parliament or the general public.   The measurescan only receive the Royal Assent after a motion has been madein both Houses and Parliament therefore cannot wholly divorceitself from responsibility - a responsibility which wouldnot be fulfilled unless the motions are taken after- adequatenotice and at a time of day at which members may be expectedto attend and take an active part in the proceedings ofParliament.(Initialled)   H.

                                                              i  (!i                         APPENDIX 2. eficas Act 1898            The object of this Measure is to make eiidment)  Measure 1923                      impossible sales of the rights of patronage                      of a  benefice after two vaaancies subsequent                      to the passing of this Measure.                           Of Crown patrons this  affects the lord                      Chancellor mainly,  as these sales are his                      only  means of setting up a  fund  for the                      improvement of other livings in  his patronage.                      (His  exercise of this right ia,  in fact, closely                      limited  by Statute,  and he  rarely uses  it).                           The system as  exercised  by  private patons                      is  however capable  of misuse;  and the lord                      Chancellor is  not disposed  to  regard  it as                      desirable  that the  Crown should  retain a                      privilege  of which  for  good reasons private                      patrons  are to be dispossessed.in cf Benefices             This  measure deals with the proceduresure 19&amp;3                      whereby, when  found  expedient, two benefices                      can be merged  into  one, or parts of one                  *  benefice can&apos;be merged  in others.  It  contains                      however a  provision whereby, when a union of                     benefices  has  taken place, the Ecclesiastical                     Commissioners are empowered to divert  to                     any living thoy wish  in the same diocese,  any                      surplus revenue arising from the union, where                      such revenue is derived from endowment which                     belonged to the benefice prior to January 1st,                     1800.   (This is an arbitrary date fixed merely                     with the intention of not disturbing modern                     endowments).  The other provisions in  this                               -8-
*i n u4 I J                     measure are of secondary importance in their                     effect on Crown patronage and are consequential                     on the above.                          By giving the Ecclesiastical Commissioners                     powers to divert surplus revenue the Measure                     hands over proprietary rights of the Crown to                     be dealt with in the discretion of the                     Commissioners;  and the patronage of the  First                     Lord of the Treasury,  the Lord Chancellor,  and                     the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster  are                     all affectedo                          It should he realised  in this connection                     that the principle that the proper authorities                     of the Church should  have power to divert                     excessive endowments  is the foundation of  the                     whole scheme under which the Ecclesiastical                     Commissioners  and  their common fund  exist,       Winchester)ese of Southwell )  (Division)  Measure  1923       Blackburn )                          Each Measure  respectively seeks to                    $diminish  the area  of  the present  diocese and  to                     create a  fresh one  in  each  ease.   It provides                     formal machinery  for  the setting  up  of a Dean                     and  Chapter  in eaoh new diocese to accept the                     King&apos;s nominee as  Bishop.                          If it  is  the  considered view of the Church                     that  the  cure  of  souls  will  be more adequately                     exercised by these  means there seems no cause                     for  the Crown  to  object,,
