(THIS DQCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)HP. 287 (24).S E C RET.C A B I I E T.                HOME  AFFAIRS  COMMITTEE.                GUARDIANSHIP OF INFANTS.         Memorandum by the Solicitor-General.       A Bhort time before the introduction of Mrs Wintringham&apos;sGuardianship of Infanta Bill, I was asked by the Home Secretaryto convene a meeting of the various Government Departments inter-OBted or affected by thia Bill, ami, subsequently, having learnedtheir views, I conferred with the promoters of Mrs Wintringham&apos;aBill and other persona generally interested in the question ofthe Guardianship of Infante       I duly met the various gentlemen representing GovernmentDepartments, that is to say, Sir Claud Schuster, Clerk of theCrown, Sir John Anderson and Sir Ernley Blaokwell of the HomeOffice, Mr.M.L.George of the Ministry of Health and others,and we agreed provisionally to a basis of  amendment to MrsWintringham&apos;a Bill which we were prepared to recommend to theHome Affairs Committee by way of compromise.   Subsequently, wemet Mrs Wintringham, Lord Asquith, Dr.Burgin and others on several occasions before Mrs Wintringham&apos;s Bill had receivedits second reading, and, on the day when that Bill was down forseoond reading, namely April 4th, I asked permission of theHome&apos;Affairs Committee to bring the matter before them as urgent,in order that Mr.Rhys Davies, Under Secretary for Home Affairs,might be In a position that afternoon to represent the Governmentpoint of view on the matter.   The decision of the Home AffairsCommittee is contained in Conclusion No.9. dated April 24th and
it is so material to an understanding of the present situation that I venture to set it forth in grtenoo i-2,        &quot;The Home Affairs Committee were informed, as a     matter of urgency, that an immediate decision was required     as to the attitude to he adopted by the Government     towards mr.Wintringham&apos;ti Guardianship of Infants Bill,           The Solicitor-General stated that he had conferred     with the promoters of the Bill, and, after consultation with     the Departments concerned, a Bill had been drafted emboiy-     ing proposals which the Government might submit to     Parliament.           The main differences between Ur3 Wintringhaffi&apos;s Bill     and the suggested Government proposals are;-             (1)  In Clause 3 of Mrs Wintringham!s Bill it la     proposed to give the mother of every legitimate Infant     the guardianship and custody of the infant jointly with     the father, and also to give her equal authority, rights     and responsibilities regarding the infant,   The draft     Government Bill proposal is that in any legal proceedings     where custody or upbringing ia in question the Court is     to have regard solely to the welfare of the infant and     not to take into consideration whether the claim of either     parent is superior to that of the othert             (S)  By Clause 9 of the Bill the father and mother     are given equal powers to appoint guardians by deed or will.     The draft Government Bill proposes to confer on the parents     equal rights of appointment, the surviving parent having     the right to object to the claim of the guardian appointed     by the deceased parent( to act jointly with him or her, with     discretion to the Cour&apos;i in cases of dispute,            (o)   By Clause 4 of the Bill the mother may obtain     and enforce an Order for maintenance against the father     notwithstanding that 3he still resides with him,  The     Draft Government Bill proposes that tho Order shall not be     enforceable while the parents are residing together.             The Corm.--ittes agreed -             (1)  To approve generally the proposals outlined                  by the Solicitor-General for dealing with the                  above questions of guardianship and maintenance,             (2)v That the Parliamentary Under Secretary for                  Home Affairs should be authorised to inform                  the House of Commons in the course of the                  second reading debate on Mrs Wintringham&apos;a                 ,Bill that,  while the Government were in favour                 &quot; of the principle of giving equal rights of                  guardianship to the parents the present Bill                  was open to serious legal and practical                  objections,  and the Government intended to                  formulate their own proposala in a Bill to                  be introduced forthwith in the House of lords.             (3)  To request the Home Secretary to arrange for the                  circulation to the Cabinet of a draft  Guardian-                  ship of Infanta Bill.&quot;
     An announcement was made by Mr, Davies practicallyin the terms of the decision of the Home Affairs Committeethe same afternoon (see Hansard April 4th - 2696-2701),and after that announcement, several further meeting were  held with Mrs, Wintringhsm and her supporters and ultimatelyan agreement wa3 -made substantially on the lines which the &apos;Home Affairs Committee agreed to on April 4th with a few  -minor amendments now embodied in the Government^ proposed bill,     Acting upon the Minute Ktoa9,, I and those supporting me,were prepared to endorse the statement of Mr, Davies,  andall recent negotiations have proceeded on that basis.     As I understand it there is no difficulty with regardto any part of the Governments Bill except Clause 2 (nowClause 3)o   The position with regard to this Clause is setout in the Minutes of the Home Affairs Committee No,10, Liay2nd, and the position is a very difficult and delicate oneboth for me and the Party generally, if any doubt is castupon the decision which was reached on April 4th as follows:--         (3) &quot;By Clause 4 of the Bill the mother may     &quot;obtain and enforce an Order for maintenance against     &quot;the father notwithstanding that she still resides     &quot;with him.   The draft Government Bill proposes     &quot;that the Order shall not be enforceable while the     &quot;parents are residing together,&quot;     It was explained, as appears In that Minute, that(see Decision 2 (o)), the Committee had agreed &quot;to approvegenerally the proposals outlined by the Solicitor-general for dealing with the above questions of guardianship andmaintenance/&apos;   It will be seen that the agreement obviouslycovers the case of the Government Bill proposing that  anOrder shall not be enforceable while the parents are residingtogether, whereas, Mrs, Wintringham&apos;s Bill by Clause 4demanded that the mother might obtain and\enforce such Order                             -3-
May 6th. 1924. against  the  father  notwithstanding that  the  mother  still resided  with him.    It  will  be  seen therefore, that the only difference on this  point-which  was  discussed before the Home Affairs Committee, as appears  from  this  Minute and as it remains within my personal recollection without any doubt, was the question whether the Order  should or&apos;should not be enforceable during  consortium.   The question now raised as to the expediency of giving a wife power to obtain an Order on this point in any event until she separated from her husband was never raised on April 4th although  I explained to the best of my ability and with such lucidity aa I possess what the effect of the Clause would be.     In these circumstances I have no doubt that a refusal to accept the compromise of April 4th would jeopardise the whole agreement and create considerable estrangement with the promoters of Mr Si WIntringham&apos;s Bill.     Finally I observe that the matter has never been before the Cabinet as distinguished from the Home Affairs Committee, except to this extent, that I undersatnd that this particular Minute of the Home Affairs Committee on this question hag generally been circulated to the Cabinet.   If the Cabinet propose to give the matter further consideration I respectfully suggest tlift.&apos;I should be invited to attend and explain the whole matter.     The annexed, statement expresses the  a&apos;reed opinion  of the Government Committee on.-this subject,                            (Initialled)   H.H.S.
AMBEX TO O.P. 28 7  ( 4).               754     Agreed Memorandum by Members of the Committeeappointed.by the Home Secretary on the Guardianshipof Infants negotiations.              Bills on this subject Were introduoed in 192o/2i/22         and 83, but although the Bills of 1922 and 1923 were referred         to Joint Committees of the two Houses the Committees failed         to come to any agreement and no progress was made.  In         1924 a Bill substantially similar to its predecessors was         introduoed by Mrs. Wintringham in ihe House of Commons and         after being welcomed by a large number of speeches from         every side of the House received  a second reading without         a division on the 4tb April.              Mr.  Rhys Davies who spolce on behalf of the Government         on the second reading had been authorised to express         sympathy with *the objects of the  promoters and  to promise         that  a Government Bill  dealing with  the  subject  should  be         introduoed in the Hous8 of Lords  as  soon as possible afterlansard    Easter,   He stated (in  accordance  with the decision  of  the th AprilfW4      Home  Affairs  Committee  of April 4th)  that three  principal 696 -J701,     provisions of the Government  Bill  would  be:-              (l)   Absolute equality  between  father and mother in  any           &apos;*      cases  that might come before the Courts  under the                   existing law,  regard  to  be  had  solely  to the                   welfare of the  child.              (2)   An-amendmentmof..the  Act  of  1886 providing  &quot;that  aHansard             HMjQJgv gjbfoi&quot; aQ  Order for custody and mainta- &apos;?00               nanco..while, still resident,with the father but                   that such an  Order  shall&apos;, nat_.be.....enforceable while                   she ,Btlll resides with him&quot;. and              (3)   Absolute equality between husband and wife as                   regards appointment  of guardians.                                ^5--
      These undertakings fell far short of the expectations of the promoters and did not receive a very warm reception from the House.   The objections to going further were substantially those discussed at length before the two Joint Committees and related  in particular to the following provisions      Clause (Z),   Establishing on a  footing of absolute equality the  rights and  obligations  of father  and  mother in regard  to the guardianship  of their  children;  and  enabling any matter in dispute to  be brought  within  the  purview of the Courts.      Clauses  4 and  5.  Providing  for  the making of Orders cf custody  and maintenance in  respect of  children  whose parents are living together.      Clause 7.  Providing for  the attachment of wages.     As  regards Clause (3) while no  objection was seen to placing  husband and wife on an eoual footing in matters which as  the law stands could be brought before a Court it was thought  that a provision allowing them to bring before a Court any  question however trivial that might be in dispute between  them could not fail to be subversive of all family life and  wtjuld place an impossible task on the Judges In many cases.     Clauses-4. and 5.  Similar objection was felt to a provision which would enable a wife while still living with her husband to obtain an Order for payment of money which could only be enforced  in the last resort by seizure  of the property of the home,  or imprisonment of the husband,  whowould normally be the wage earner.     Clause 7. It was felt that a provision  for attachment of wages would be highly  controversial and best excluded fromthe Bill.
      In accordance with  the  decision  of  the  Cabinet^dn^the  5th March, 19 4S  conferences have been  held  with  the promoters of the Bill,  as a result of  which agreement has now been reached on a  draft Bill, a copy of  which is annexed.  The promoters while stating  plainly that  the Bill does not go as far as they would wish have  accepted  it  as a useful measure of reform and undertaken not to put down any amendments but to lend their support to the Government  in securing its passage as an agreed measure.     The Bill begins by  a statement of principle in the&apos;) preamble to which the promoters attach great importance..     OLauae fl). carries  out Mr, Rhys Davles: first promise,viz;           Absolute equality between father and mother in           any cases that.might come before the Courts,&quot;     P-l9M2-.(jl was inserted at the insistent request of  the promoters although they  wore not able ho point to any definite matter in which a  father had greater powers of application to the Court than a mother.     Clause (3)  carries out Mr,  Rhys Davies&apos; second promiseand is a compromise between the existing law and the more extreme proposals  contained in clauses (4)  and (5)  of Mrs. ftlntringham&apos;s Bill.     It may be noted  that the Summary Jurisdiction  (Separationand Maintenance)  Bill whioh received a second&apos;reading unopposedon the 6th  March,  1924,  proposes  to do away with the require-ment contained in  the Married Women (Maintenance) Act,  1395,that an application by a  married  woman for  an Order  on the-ground of cruelty  or  neglect by her husband may  only be made if such cruelty or neglect  have already  caused  her to  leave and live separately and  apart from him.     Clause (4), gives equal powers to  father and mother inregard to the  appointment of guardians, and    -Clause (5) deals with  the  situation  on the  death  of  aparent who  has failed to  appoint  a  guardian,
      These clauses replace Sections  (2)  and  (3)  of thej&apos;p-&quot;w                                                      It O S Guardianship of Infants  Act,  1886.      QlM&amp;e.A$.l provides as regards  England  and  Wales  that the  Court  of Summary  Jurisdiction shall  be added to  the County Court and  High Court for  the  purpose  of dealing with certain types of  application  under the Bill, and      pJjyjBS-jiiil  deals with the  enforcement  of Orders  for payment  of money  made by Summary Courts.,      Clause  (7j   contains  a provision taken  from the Children Act,  1908, for  the attachment of pension  or income.      Clauso  (8) is  limited  to England and Wales:.    It places father and mother  on an  equality as regards  consents required to  the marriage  of infants.      It seems  clear from the prolonged discussions that have taken place  that the draft Bill now circulated represents the absolute minimum necessary to secure anything likeagreement in the House of Commons,  and,  in view of the pledges given on behalf of the Labour  Party during and before the Election and of the attitude of other Parties as  disclosedby the Speeches on the Second  Beading of Mrs. Wintringham&apos;bill, it seems highly desirable that  early steps  should betaken to give  effect to the compromise now arrived at andavert t e. danger which might result  from a renewal of the agitation for a more radical amendment of the law.
