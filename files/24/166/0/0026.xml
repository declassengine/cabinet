(24),..                CABINET.,-          ACRICUlVrUHAL  WAGES (RBOULATIOM ) BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of.Agriculture and Fisheries.      On the 26th inst.,  I circulated  a draft Bill  for the regulation of Agricultural Wages with  a covering Memorandum(CP. 217 (24)).      The draft Bill  was  considered by the Home  Affairs Committeeon the 28th ult.,  and it  was decided that the agricultural policy Committee  should In consultation- with the Ministry ofLabour examine the Bill and the  -Memoranda circulated  therewithand report to the Cabinet direct.      The Committee further recommended the  Cabinet as amatter of urgency to  authorise  the introduction  of  the Billin its finally approved form without further reference tothe Home Affairs  Committee.       The Agricultural Policy Committee have since, ihconsultation with the Minister of Labour, considered thedraft Bill and recommended       (l)  That  no fixed minimum rate of wages  should be              included  in. the Bill, but that the Bill  should              contain a provision on the lines of the  provision              contained in the Corn Production Act  1917, viz,              &quot;In fixing  minimum rates under this section the              Agricultural Wages T3oard shall so  far as              practicable secure for able-bodied men wages  which              In the  opinion of  the Board are adequate to promote               efficiency and to enable a man in an ordinary              case to maintain himself and his family  in              accordance  with such standard  of comfort as may              be reasonable in relation to the nature  of his              occupation&quot;. -
                              I                                 J- u 0          (2)   That  County Committees should be empowered to fix                 (subject  to  confirmation by the Central Agricultural                 Wages Board.)  minimum rates of wages for all                 persons employed  in agriculture.          (3)   That  the Agricultural Wages Board should have such                 powers of fixing  minimum rates as will enable                 them to fix  rates where a county committee fails                 to  do so, or  where the committee fixes rates                 which the Central Board are unable to confirm.  If                 on  the rate being re-submitted by the County                 Committee to  the  Board for confirmation the Board                 are unable to confirm the revised rate the Board                 shall themselves  fix a rate.           (4)  That the Minister  shall have power to refer to the                 Central Board for  reconsideration and necessary                 action any rate which appears to the Minister to                 be  unsuitable.  If a rate is so referred by the                 Minister  to  the Central Board for reconsideration                 and necessary action the Central Board shall thereupon&apos;                 refer&apos; the matter  to the County Committee for                 consideration.  Rates are not to be subject to                 confirmation  by the Minister.           (5)  That the Parliamentary Counsel should be instructed                 to  revise the draft Bill In accordance with these                 recommend at ions.              I desire the authority of the Cabinet to introduce     the  Bill  revised in accordance with the recommendations of the     Agricultural Policy Committee and with such drafting amendments &amp;i     may  be found to be desirable  after consultation with the     Minister  of  Labour.                                   1  .        N.B.Ministry of Agriculture and Fishor-ies,                                 f     1st  April, 1924.
