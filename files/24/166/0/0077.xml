WM1M3H1P 13 TBS PBOIBRCT 0? EIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOvTSRNMBHT).R E  T.;77 (24).                                                       ^-0 A B I K 13 T.QUOTA fOR MIGRANTS TOOTHS UNITED STATESMemo,., by; the Secretary of State for the Colonies *     lly colleagues will ho aware that the United StatesGovernment is at present considering the revision of theAmerican immigration law, and several Bills are beforeCongressa  I have reason to believe that unofficialrepresentations have been made in Washington on behalfof the Irish Free State, with a view to semiring thatthe new Act shall admit of a separate immigration quotabeing accorded to that Dominion.     Under the existlag system the British Islands are allowed a quota of .oeventy--seven thousand per annum,.Under any revision of legislation which may take placethis quota is likely to be reduced.  The &quot;Johnson&quot; bill provides for the allocation of a separate quota to anyso If-governing Dominion which has been established since1890.  If a separate quota is granted to the Irish freeState, then, owing to ths very largo emigration from ireland In the past and the consequent large populationof Irish in the United States, it is probable that thenumbers available for Great Britain and northern ireland would be reduced to far more than the proportion of thopresent population.  A table is annexed showing a roughcomputation of the effect of the Johnson Bill uponemigration from Great Britain and northern Ireland.     However unfortunate the effect of this legislationmay be from the point of view of intending emigrants from
this country to the United States of America,  i feel that His Majesty^ Government would not hejustified in making representations to the UnitedStates Government against the possible changes, forthe following reasons,.     It would be inconsistent with the dominion status of the Irish Free State to refuse her aseparate quota which is already allotted to otherDominions *     It has been the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to impress upon foreign governments in general and the United States Government inparticular the separate status and treatment ofself-governing Dominions.     If the &quot;Johnson&quot; Bill becomes law ( and thisis at present far from certain) an agreement mightbe come to with the&quot; Government of the Irish FreeState under which some adjustment of the numbersbased more nearly on present population could be suggested to Washington.  This would obviate thepossibility of conflicting representations beingmade to a foreign Power by different units of theBritish Commonwealth *     It *seems undesirable to take any action in thematter until the prospects of the various Bills beforeCongress are more definite.                          flntd.)
