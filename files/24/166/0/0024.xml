ij LiTHIS DOGUMEHT-.IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 Si--             GOVERNMENT.5(24).        CABINET.   UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMMITTEE.            g Q   UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE  BILLS.MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  MINISTER  OF  LABOUR,1.   I circulate herewith the drafts of two UnemploymentInsurance Bills, one a comprehensive measure dealing with anumber of points, and the other a short &quot;stop-gap&quot; Bill.The short Bill must be passed before Easter if benefit ina large number of cases is not to cease on April 16th,and for reasons which I explain in paragraph 5, the largerBill ought to be introduced not later than the short Bill.2,   The larger Bill carries out generally the decisionsof the Cabinet of March 17th (Cabinet Conclusions 23/24);in one or two matters a decision has not yet been taken, ora re-consideration of the Cabinet1s decision is asked for, andthese points are mentioned where they arise.3.   The principal provisions of the larger Bill are asfollows     (1) Period of Benefit,     Subject to the requisite qualifying conditions, benefit isto be payable without limit of time to insured workpeoplegenuinely unemployed.     For a period not exceeding 26 weeks in each benefit year,benefit is to be payable on termsfeubstantially the same as those now applying to what is called &quot;covenanted&quot; benefit.  The chiefvariation of these terms is that whereas at^present thepreliminary qualification is payment of 12 contributions at anytime, the corresponding qualification now proposed, in accordancewith the Cabinet decision, is that at least 30 contributions
1 ROJL w     should have been paid In a period  of two  to three years     preceding  the claim, but up  to  October, 1925,  the     Minister is to have power to waive this requirement.         After the benefit referred to in  the  preceding     paragraph  is exhausted, further benefit may be drawn     without limit of time subject to certain  more  stringent     qualifications as  approved by the  Cabinet. -         (2) Rates of  Benefit.         The existing  and proposed  rates of benefit are  as     follows  :-                   Man.  Woman.  Boy.  Girl.   Boy..  Girl. &apos;                                 Ut-M  16-18.  14-16 14^16.

(3) Age  of  entry into  Insurance,         Liability to  insurance  is  to  commence at  the  age     of 14  instead  of at  the age  of  16  as at  present.         The rates of  benefits  proposed between  14 and 16  are     set out  above.         The rates of  contribution  proposed  for  boys and girls     between  14 and 16  are the  same  as  those  for  boys and girls     between  16 and 18.  As this is a  point  which  has  not  been     decided  by the Cabinet,  I  attach a special note on it  in     Appendix I.          There is a  further  point  on which I propose to ask for a    . re-consideration of  the Cabinet decision. The Cabinet     decided  that in  the  case  of boys and girls between 14  and     16 &quot;payment of benefit  should  be made  direct to their     parents&quot;.    The  draft Bill  doss not  at present provide for                             -  -? -
this,  and I attach a  note on the point&apos;in Appendix II.     Power is taken to make grants out of the UnemploymentFund towards the expenses of Juvenile Unemployment Centres(or any other similar centres that may be set up)  to an extent not exceeding half of those expenses.     (4)  The present provision for the refund ofcontributions under certain conditions to workpeople atthe age of 60 is to be abolished for the future, but -     (a) valid claims to refund which might have been madepreviously but have not been made, will be paid in fullon condition that they are made  within 12 months of thepassing of the Act;     (b) a limited amount of compensation will be payable to persons of the age of 50 or over in respect of theabolition of their prospective rights to refund arisingfrom past contributions;  here also no claims will beallowed unless made within 12 months of the passing of theAct.     (5) Trade, Dispute Disqualification.     The present disqualification of workpeople thrown outof work owing to a dispute at the Establishment at whichthey were employed but not participating In the dispute,is to be removed,     (6) Special Schemes.     The power to form special schemes of insurance by industry is  to be abolished for the future.                                          ii  -     The two special schemes for the Insurance Industryand the Banking Industry respectively, the former of whichhas been in  existence since July, 1921, and the latter ofwhich is expected shortly to come into existence, are
saved but the Exchequer grant now payable to these schemesis to be no longer payable.     (7) Exchequer Contribution.     The Bill as at present drafted proposes that theExchequer contribution to the Unemployment Fund shall      ;:!remain at the present proportion of one-third of the combined contributions of employers and employed until theend of the &quot;deficiency period&quot;, i.e. until theUnemployment Fund has paid up to its debt, and that,after the end of the &quot;deficiency period&quot;, the exchequer contribution shall be altered to half of thosecontributions (i.e. one-third of the total revenue ofthe Fund).     Under the existing law the Exchequer contribution,after the end of the &quot;deficiency period&quot;, is to bereduced to one-fourth of the combined contributions of employers and employed (i.e. one-fifth of the totalrevenue of the Fund).     The possibility of leaving the Exchequer contribution for the time being at its present proportion of one-fourthof the whole depends on whether the proposals in the Billtaken as a whole, will be financially sound on this basis,  jI have not yet been furnished with a report by theGovernment Actuary to enable me to-deal with this point,but I should warn my colleagues that, if the proposals in the draft Bill are not financially sound, I should      -f                                                           be bound to press for the requisite Increase in theExchequer contribution, as it is, In my opinion,impossible to increase the contributions from employers or employed.
                                                           119                                                           JL JL W      The Bill contains no proposals  dealing with the  following points  i-      (8) Tnolvi?&apos;1.ou,of, PgrvcvHMre ,,      This question  is still being investigated  and  in the meantime I have not found it.  possible to frame  proposals which seem likely to meet with any general measure  of acceptance.      (9) Inclusion  of Permanent Railway Servants..      Proposals for  this purpose were not to bo  inserted unless there was some likelihood of  acceptance by those directly interested and I am not yet able  to  say what  receptions such proposals would be likely to receive.                      &quot;STOP-GAP&quot;  BILL. 4,    This Bill increases to 41 weeks the maximum number  of weeks of  benefit that may be drawn  in the  &quot;First Benefit  Year&quot; i.e. the period from mid-October,  1923, to mid-October,  1924.   At present the maximum is 26 weeks.      I have deliberately limited  the proposal to a  maximum of  41 weeks, instead  of taking the whole 52 weeks,  for several reasons      (a) The grant  of 41 weeks would bring us to about the end of  July, i.e, almost the  end  of  the Session, before benefit will begin  to be exhausted.   It is important to leave the House with every possible  incentive to pass the comprehensive Bill  in order to allow further  benefit  after the end of July, and under my proposals  tho House cannot  complain that they are not being given sufficient time because they will have practically tho whole of the Session if  necessary, *in which to deal with  the Bill.      (b) A proposal to allow  the  full 52 weeks  might  raise a controversial point  on the &quot;stop-gap&quot; Bill as  to whether it is
I IB. right  for benefit to  be  paid  for every week in the year.   This is  an  arrangement which  Is,  in fact,  proposed in the larger Bill and can be debated  on that Bill.   Meannhile the point of  principle is left  unprejudiced,  since my proposal to grant 41  weeks out of 52 does  not  go so far as the action of the late Government in granting,  between November, 1922, and mid-  - October, 1923, 44 weeks  of benefit  out of 50.                         TIME-TABLE. 5,   While I realise  that  it is likely to take a considerable time to pass the larger  Bill  through the Bouse, I regard it as  essential that this Bill should  be in the hands of members before, or at any rate not later than, the &quot;stop-gap&quot; Bill. The larger Bill, in my view,  represents the minimum which should be  done for the amendment  of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, It  is  necessary to pass  the &quot;stop-gap&quot; Bill at once for special reasons.  But it vvould place  the Government in a false position and give a dangerous handle for attack if their more general plans are left-unoertnln,.dxur*lng the d;Uaus-6-ioru.-an. the-1 smaller Bill,                                        (Intd.) T.S. Ministry of Labour, 28th March, 1924.- 6 -
                      APPSHDIX  I.Rates  of  contribution  for boys and  girls  between 14 and 16,    The  proposed weekly rates of benefit are  5/- (boys)and  4/-  (girls).    If  the contributions are made roughlyproportional to the benefits, they  will be as  followsfor  various ages:-Employer Employed Exchequer	I Male	Pema te	Male	Female	Male	Female,	3 d. 3d. lfd.	3d. 2ld. lfd.	5d. 4*d, 3ld.	4d. 3ld.	lOd. 9d. 6fd.	8d. 7d. 5&amp;3.     The  special rates  for ages 14-16 will mean the issueof special books for stamping and special stamps.  The PostOffice, which has already a great variety of stamps to sell,will have it3 difficulties increased and Employers willhave greater trouble in handling the different kinds of books and stamps.     Considerable loss  of revenue is. almost inevitable.Such loss now occurs at age 18, owing to failure to change to the higher rote of contribution.  The same thing wouldin future occur at age  16,     It  is, therefore,  suggested that the rates of contributionsbetween 14 and 16 should be the same as those payable between16 and 18,   The difference Is small and the argument whichmay be advanced that it is not fair to charge the samecontribution when the benefit Is lower is not really sound,The answer to this argument is it is not reasonable to ask,nor indeed is it practicable, that- the premiums for variousgroups of contributors  should be varied so as to correspondexactly with the benefits.
APPENDIX II.           Payment of benefit direct to boys and                  girls between 14 ^and^T^T&quot;     Tho Cabinet decided on March 17th 1924 (cabinet conclusions 21/24) that the unemployment benefit which itis proposed to proviso fcr boys and girls between 14 and16 by extending the Unemployment Insurance scheme to them should be paid to their parents and guardians and not direot.to the boys and girls.     It is feared this would give rise to a great deal of difficulty.     These boys and girls must have been in employment for aconsiderable time - for otherwise they would not be entitledto benefit - and their weekly.wages, whioh of course are paid direct to them, would amount to a good deal more than tbenefit we propose.   It would not be easy to explain why thcannot be trusted to take 5/- benefit home when they havealready had for a considerable time loA- or 15/- paid tothem week by week in wages,     The parents or guardians would be put to great trouble,They would have to give proof of their relationship to the child and produce some evidence of identification when theycalled for the benefit, since the officials could not beexpected to know by sight the parents or guardians of each child.   They would moreover have to call for the benefit at considerable inconvenience either during the day when theywould ordinarily be at work or occupied with home duties, -                                            -if.        ,  .or in the evening which may not be much less/convenient.These difficulties would be aggravated when they live at.some distance from the Ministry&apos;s office, and it is tc beremembered that the boys and girls themselves would have toattend just as frequently, in order to prove unemployment,                                                       /as
as if they  received  payment  of benefit direct.     Difficult  questions  would sometimes arise in decidingwho is the  parent  or guardian to receive the money,&quot;particularly  in the  case, of  orphans or deserted children.Other children  living away from home would present a special difficulty.  We should also  no doubt have the case of the mother who  objected  to the payment being made to the fatherbecause he  cannot  bo trusted to bring it&apos;home.     Administratively the proposal could no doubt be worked,though the  necessary safeguards and unavoidable complexitieswould be such as to  cause an inordinate expense in workingcosts,                                              , .,     For the  general reasons indicated, however, it is strongly urged  that  the proposal should be reconsidered andthat payment  of this benefit 3hould be made, as in other cases, direct to the insured contributor.
Unemployment  Insurance (No. 2)                    Bill.                MEMORANDUM.    The Unemployment Insurance Act,  1923, providesthat the periods  for  which  unemployment  benefit(whether covenanted or uncovenanted) may be received during  the first benefit year (i.e., 18th  October, 1923,to 15th October, 1924) shall not exceed in the aggregatetwenty-six weeks  ; the Bill proposes to substitute forthis a maximum of forty-one weeks of benefit.    The additional benefit allowed by the  Bill  will be governed by the  conditions applying  to uncovenantedbenefit..91-2

       (5) Notwithstanding  that  the employment  of  an  A,p. 1924.   insured contributor has  terminated, he  shah  not  be        deemed to be unemployed within the meaning  of this   section if  and so long as he is in receipt of any payment 5 by  way of compensation for the remuneration  which   he  would have received  if  the  employment had not   terminated,       2.
