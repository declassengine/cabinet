The discussion on the second reading WXB opened last       Wednesday, and after the speeches of Mr.Heville Chamberlain       and Mr. Isquith, it seemed clear to those who- heard- them&apos; that&quot; &quot;&quot;        the Bill would be defeated unless an assurance was given by        us to the House that steps would be taken to throw upon the       community the burden of paying the rent nf unemployed workmen        threatened with eviction.    I accordingly had a discussion        in my room with the following of my colleagues, who alone      . were then immediately available in the House of Commons.;       the Minister of Health, the Secretary for Scotland, the       Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Chief Whip.  There       was also present at this meeting the Parliamentary Private       Secretary to the Prime Minister,            We reached the unanimous conclusion that I should give an       assurance to the House that we were willing to substitute in       Committee an amended clause in substitution for the existing       Clause 1, which would throw the burden upon the&apos; community, or       if this were not possible we would take other steps to Secure       this end.   All my colleagues agreed that    whatever means it       could be done we should secure shelter for families threatened       with eviction rather than let the Bill be defeated.            On Thursday 1 stated in the House that a further       announcement would be made on Priday,   Before the Prime       Minister left the House on Thursday I showed him the notes                                            ill!                                            .11                  on
on which my statement would he based.   I immediately     nrgot into touch with the Parliamentary Draftsman in chargeof the Bill, and in the absence of Mr. Wheatley, with his principal Assistant at the Ministry, who at my request onFriday morning had an interview with the Solicitor general for Scotland and the Under Secretary for Scotland in regardto the doubtful points which had been raised on the previous evening in regard to the position in Scotland.     1 then communicated to Mr. Speaker the terms of thestatement that I intended to make at the conclusion ofbusiness for that day*   This statement I made at 4 o&quot;clockin the Terms recorded in Hansard this morning.   immediately on the conclusion of my statement Mr. Neville Chamberlainput the following question:-               &quot;Is it the intention that the final               &quot;verdict shall .rest upon the parish               &quot;council in Scotland, and the               &quot;board af guardians in England, as               &quot;the case may be, or has he in mind               &quot;some recourse to national funds in               &quot;aid of the local authorities.&quot;to which, in accordance with the advice which I had receivedfrom the technical and. legal officers whom I had consulted,I replied:-               V.The intention is that, in               &quot;the case of Scotland as&apos; of               &quot;,this country, the burden               &quot;should rest upon the local               &quot;authorities.Mr. Kirkwood then made a speech in which he said that thePrime Minister had given &quot;a guarantee that it would be anational charge&quot;, and in which after abusing all of us hedemanded not looal but&apos;Exchequer support, saying;  &quot;the house will back up brave and oourageous men - but jellyfish!&quot;   in referring to his speeoh in my reply I said:-               &quot;I have stated that, in the first               &quot;instanoe, this- charge will be               &quot;borne by the local authorities.               &quot;I have not said one word to indicate               &quot;the view that the Government is               &quot;opposed to recouping the\looal authorities               &quot;from State funds.   That is a question               &quot;which, of course, the Government will               &quot;be prepared to  examine.&quot;                                                     Here
Here I had in mind the fact that if our Bill became  law thelocal authorities would certainly press for some state assistance, and that we must-be prepared in due course  toexamine that question.   I felt convinced that we could not  .enlist the aid of our own party for this Bill if we  rejectedabsolutely the possible prospect of ultimate aid being  givento local authorities.   I urged, however, that to meetthe urgent necessities of threatened and distressed  workmensomebody must provide the money, and the Bill took theswiftest course to supply a remedy.          Mr. Chamberlain then put the following further question:          &quot;When the right hon. Gentleman          &quot;speaks about recouping the local          &quot;authorities, does he mean that he          &quot;is going to advance money to  Lhem          &quot;from national funds or does he mean          &quot;that the charge shall rest in the          &apos;nlast instance upon national funds          &quot;and would  therefore require a Money          &quot;Resolution?&quot;.To which I replied:          &quot;It ia really too early to discuss          &quot;the method or the procedure.          &quot;This is not the time to determine          &quot;whether money will be advanced or          &quot;refunded after aotual payment&quot;.&apos;          My colleagues will realise from the above  thatthe effect of my statement did not go beyond an assurance that the question of  State Aid to local authorities  wouldbe considered siX--a later date should the necessitytherefor arise.J.  R.  CLYNES.5th April,  1924.
