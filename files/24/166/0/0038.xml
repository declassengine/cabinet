Hument  is the  property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.3                 G k B I N B 1%                          0 0               Parent s 1 Pensions *  MEMORANDUM (N0.4) PROM THE MINISTER OP  PENSIONS,          I desire to  submit, for the  information of theCabinet, the following Memorandum by way of supplement to memorandum No,  1*          llth  reference to  paragraph  7 of Memorandum No,l,I have now obtained  the sanction of the Treasury to somesubstantial amendments of  the existing scheme  of pensions toparent s .      (l)  Transfer of  a Pre-War Dependence or  Flat-Rate          fens ion from one parsnt&quot;&apos;&quot;to  another&quot; In &quot;base of .Death.          Under the  Wprrants in force  before the31st March, 1922, the  Minister  of  Pensions had power totransfer either of these two classes  of  pension from oneparent at  death, to  the surviving  parent.   This power  lapsedwith the amendments  of the earlier Warrants,   The withdrawalof this power was generally felt to  cause hardship.   I havenow obtained power to  authorise transfer in cases of deathon the lines of the  former practice  of the Ministry,      (2)  parents  Need Pensions,          After full consideration of  the present schemeof Need Pensions, I  came to the conclusion that whilethat  scheme carried  out generally  the  principlerecommended by the Select  Committee on Pensions  (viz., thatthe basis of compensation  should be to the extent towhich the deceased son might reasonably  have been expected to contribute to  the support  of his parentshad he survived) nevertheless  its  provisions were in                                                   some
some respects defective.   Cn the one hand, they were not sufficiently  elastic  to admit  of  the  varying  individualcircumstances  of cases being taken  into  account and,  onthe  other,  they were  not  generally  sufficiently generous.I have now  obtained sanction to the following amendments of the scheme.     (a)  The minimum pension  rate  will  be raised  from         4/Sd. to 5/- a  week.     (b)  For  the purpose of determining the  existence         of need as  justifying a pension, the Ministry         has hitherto worked  on  the  basis that 20/-  for         one parent  or 30/- for  two,  Is an income         adequate for support.   I have now  obtained         sanction to an  increase of  these income  limits         which will, in  future,  be 25/- for  one parent         and 35/.- for two.    The effect of this will be         that practically every  parent  who is at  present         drawing a Need  Pension  will  obtain  an Increase         of his or her pension,  ranging from about 2/6d0         to  5/- a week.     (c)  At  the same time, with  a  view  to making  the         scheme more elastic  than  it  is at present,  I         have obtained the sanction  of  the Treasury  to         certain important modifications of  it In cases where         hardship is shown to be caused by the strict letter         of  the regulations,  viz:-         (i)  Under  the  existing scheme, a half share of              the deficiency  of  the  parent&apos;s  income  Is              assigned to an  unmarried  daughter who  is              living at  home,    In future, this will only              apply  where the daughter  is engaged in a              remunerative occupation and earning not less tha              15/- a  week.         (ii)  In cases where  a wife has been deserted by              her husband, it is obviously not reasonable              as a general rule, that the State should              assume the liability of that husband as              well as of the  deceased son, but I  have now              received sanction  to working on the              principle  that  If&quot;desertion took place              three  years or  more  before the  application              for pension was made,  the husband&apos;s              contribution may be  weived, and, even              where  the  period of  desertion  has been less              than three years,  it may  be waived  if  the              Department has  ascertained that reasonable              steps  have been taken  to  secure a              . contribution from  him,  and the  contribution              does not appear likely  to be secured.        (lii)  In the few cases where  the minimum  pension              has not hitherto been  payable  solely              because of the  contributions assigned  to              other  members of the family, it has now              been agreed that the minimum pension shall              be paid,                                                   &apos;  &apos;(iv)
          (iv)  It   has now been agreed that in cases where&quot;               hardship is caused by assuming liability               for a full contribution from other surviving               sons where such sons must be regarded, owing               to  the nature of their employment, e.g., as               casual or low wage earners, or by their-civil               condition, er otherwise, as ordinarily               unlikely to be able to make the contribution               assumed, that contribution may be reduced,  and,               in  extreme cases, waived altogether.     (3)  Dependants of men who died more than seven          years after discharge&apos;or removal From duty.          The Pension Warrants have not hithertorecognised the  claim of a parent to pension where thodeath of a son occurred more than seven years after removal from duty or discharge from the service.   In view of therecent improvement in the position of the widow in similar circumstances,  I have felt that, although there areobjections at this date to tae creation of new classes of pensioners, liability for whom the State- has not hithertorecognised, the exclusion of parents in circumstancessimilar to those provided for by the recent amendments to article 17 of the  Warrant could not be sustained.   I havenow obtained sanction to, awarding pension on the basisof need to parents of men who died more than seven years afterdischarge or removal from duty, upon the same conditions as are provided in the case of the widow by Article 17, withthe proviso that the pension will not exceed the pension which could have been granted to the widow under Article 17a,where the terms of Article  17b, do not apply.      (4)  The foregoing concessions will, during the first year of their operation, result, I estimate,, in thedistribution of an additional sum of  240,000 among this very deserving class of pensioner,                        (SIGNED) FRED. 0.
