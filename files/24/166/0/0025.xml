It will be recalled that at their Meeting onMarch 17th 1924 (Cabinet 21(24) Conclusion 2) the cabinet approved, subject to certain qualifications, the recommendations contained in the Committee1e Interim fteportCP. 176(S4) and deoided that, subject to further consi-deration of the question  of finance,  both in regard tothe Exchequer contribution and Juvenile Unemployment, theMinister of Labour should be authorised to prepare draftBills in accordance with the decisions of the cabinet and to submit the Bills to the Committee for detailed consideration as soon as practicable.     In pursuance of the sbove decision the Committeehave carefully examined a Memorandum (G.P. 223(24))by the Minister of labour covering the preliminary drafts of two Unemployment Insurance Bills,  one a comprehensivemeasure dealing with the policy of the Government as awhole and the other a short &quot;stop gap&quot; Bill which mustbe passed before Easter if benefit in a large number ofcases is not to cease on April 16th 1924.3.   The Committee submit to the Cabinet the following conclusions and recommendations on the various points raised in the Minister of labour&apos;s Memorandum and the annexed draft Bills. MP33EEM- 4.    The -provisions contained in  the Unemployment BILL.Jiod and   Insuranoe  (JSo. 3) Bill relating to the  &apos;Period of Benefit&apos;224(24).STtes ofnef it.and the &quot;Kates of Benefit1  are in accordance *Lth thedecisions (d)  and (c)  of Cabinet  21(24)  2.
QJI BMIBY    S.   Liability  to insurance  is  to  oommenoe  at  the  age  of IflSUBAUCE.tee of      I4  inertoaa  of  at the  age  of 16 as at  present.   It isntributiont boys arid  proposed that  the rates of  benefit for  Juveniles  between.ria between and 16.     14     16 shall  bo -  Boys 5/-  a week  -  Girls  4/-  a week.           The weekly  rates of benefit for Juveniles  from  16 to  18           will be Boys 7/6 - Girls  6/-.               If in the  oase of 14  -  16  Juveniles the contributions           are made roughly proportional  to  the  benefits,  they will           be  as follows  for various, ages;-anployerBinployedExchequer3d.aid.Ago 36-18Male 8fi.Sid.lid.1  5d.i;sga.4a.4d.s^a.10d. 9d.6fd. 86, 7d.5id.    The special rates for ages 14-16 will mean tho issueof special bookc for stamping and special stampu.  ThePost Office, which has already a great variety of stampsto t;ell, will have its difficulties inoreasoci and employers will have greater trouble in handling thedifferent kinds of books and stamps.    Considerable loss of revenue is almost inevitable.Such leas row ooours at age 3.8, owing to failure to changto the higher rate of contribution.  The same thingwould in future eoour at age 16.    The Committee accordingly reoommend:-    (l)  That the rates of contributions between 14 and          16 should be the same as those payable           between 16 and 18.    (2)  That the above decision should  be defended.         on the grounds (a) that  the difference iu         the rates is in any case slight ana (b)  that         the suggestion that ils is not fair to -charge &apos;         tho same contribution when the benefit is         lower can be effectively met by pointing         out that it is not reaconable to ask, nop         indeed is it practicable,  that the premiums         for various groups of contributors within         one insurance field should,be varied so  as-,         to oorrespona exactly withjthe benefits.
        6.   the Cabinet will remember their deoision  that inreot  toiris     *bo case of juveniles between 14 and IS payment  of and  16.        benefit should be rode direct to their parr-ants.   The        Committee concur with the Minister of Labour in  the        view that the adoption of this proposal will give rise        to a great deal of difficulty.             These boya and girla must have been in employment        for a considerable time - for othe:cwi3e they would not be        entitled to benefit - and their weekly wages,  which of        oourso are paid direot to them, would amount to  a good        deal more than the benefit proposed.   It would  not be        easy to oxplain why they oannot be trusted to  take 0/-        benefit home when thoy have already had for a  considerable        time 10/- or 15/- paid to them v/eek by week in wags3.             She parents or guardians would be put to  great        trouble.   They would have to give proof of their        relationship to the child and produce some evidence cf        identification when thoy called for the benefit, since        the officials could not be expected to know by sight the        parents or guardians of oaoh ohild.   They would mere over        have to call for the benefit at considerable INACRIV&amp;nience^        either during the day when they would ordinarily be at        work or occupied with home duties, or in the evenlcg        which may not be much less inoonvenient.   These        difficulties would be aggravated when they live  at some        distance from the Ministry^ office, and it is to be        remembered that the boys and girls themselves would have        to  attend just as frequently, in order to prove        unemployment, as if they received payment of benefit        direot.             Difficult questions would sometimes arise in        deciding who is the pa.;.-9ut or guardian to receive the money,        particularly lu the oaue of orphans or deserted  childrea.        Other ohil-lran living away from horns would present a

Also no doubt there would be  the caso  of  the mother who objected to  the  payment being  made to  the father  because  ho  oannot be  trusted to bring it home.     Administratively  the proposal  could no doubt be worked,  though the necessary  safeguards  and unavoidable complexities would be  such as to cause  an inordinate expense  In  working oostso      She Committee recommend  -          That  for the  general  reasons  indicated  above          the  proposal  should be  reconsidered and that          payment of this  benefit should be  made, as          in other cas^s,  direot to the  insured          contributor. 7o   Provision  is made  in  the Bill  in accordance  with the Cabinet decision for  terminating of  the  present arrangements for the refund, of contributions under  certain conditions  to workpoople at tho  age of 60 and for granting compensation in certain cases  on condition  that claims for compensation are made  within 12 months  of  the passing of the Act, 0.   The Committee recommend  the Cabinet;-            To approve  the  proposal contained  in            Clause 11 of the Bill that the Minister            of labour should be at liberty to make            grants out of the  Unemployment Fund            to?rards the expenses  of Juvenile            Unemployment Centres  (or any  other            similar Centres that may be set up)            to an extent not exceeding one half            of  those expenseso 9.   The Cabinet have already agreed in  principle to  the removal of  the present disqualification  for  benefit in cases where work people are thrown out of work owing to stoppage due to trade disputes at the establishment  atwhich they  are employed though they are  taking no part in the dispute.   The Committee have requested the Parliamen- tary Counsel to consider the  drafting.of  Clause 4 (l)  of the Bill so as to secure that benefit shall not be paid to j
            special difficulty.   Also no doubt there would be the            case of the mother who objected to the payment being made            to the father because ho oannot be trusted to bring it            home.

Ihe Oommittoe are informed that the Minister of            Health is doubtful as to the desirability of enaoting            Clause 4 (S) of the Bill which is intended to enable an            insured contributor  residing in a Poor law Institution            to obtain benefit if during the time of employment,  the            contributor paid the whole tr a substantial part of the            cost of his maintenance as such inmate.                 The Committee reocmmend the Cabinet -                      To approve the proposals set  out  in                      Clause 4 (2) of tho Bill for removing tho                      disqualification for benefit of insured                      contributors residing in Poor law Institutions                      subject to the conditions contained in tho                      Clause*ilSCHEMES.   10.   the Oommittoe recommend the Cabinet -                      To approve the proposals contained in Clause 8                      of the Bill (1) for the abolition of the                      power to form special schemes of insurance                      by industry for the future subject to the                      exoeption of tfce tw.Q special  schemes  for the                      Insurance Industry and the Banking Industry                      respectively and iS) for the cessation of                      payment in future of any Exchequer grant in                      aid of a special scheme.$CHEQUES     11.
