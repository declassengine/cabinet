QUESTION OP REINSTATEMENT OP THE MSB DISMISSED PROM      THE POLICE AND PRISON SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH THE STRIKE                             OF 1919.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.   1.  I am being pressed by Mr. J.H. Hayes, M.P., to come toa decision on the question of reinstatement of the ex-membersof the Police and Prison Services who were dismissed inconsequence of the strike of 1919.  As the result of very careful examination of this question since I have been at theHome Office, I am regretfully forced to the conclusion thatthe objections to reinstatement and the difficulties in theway are of the most formidable character.   2.  I propose to deal with the question under the following heads -        (a) The history of the strikes (very briefly);        (b) the grounds on which reinstatement has been             urged and my reasons for concluding that             they cannot be substantiated;        (c) the legal and other difficulties in the way             of reinstatement.   3.  There have been two Police Strikes, the circumstances ofwhich were fundamentally different.  The first,  on 29th -31st August, 1918, affected the Metropolitan Police alone.The object of that strike was to secure improved conditions forthe Metropolitan Police, and on the promise of certain very substantial concessions by the Government all the men who hadstruck (nearly the whole force) resumed duty.  The terms of settlement included, on the side of the Government, an increaseof pay, a non-contributory scheme of widows&apos; pensions,machinery to be set up for the representation of grievances,
                             -8-                               J!and the Police to be allowed to join the Police and prison officers Union,  and, as a corollary, P,0. Thiel, a Constablewho had recently been dismissed on account of Union activities,;!to be reinstated;  on the oide of the men there was a definitesigned undertaking  (see paragraph 5 and the Appendix) thatthey would not claim the right to organise with a view toa strike.   4.  The settlement of 1918, however,  did not go to the root of the dissatisfaction then prevailing in the police forces, and early in 1919 .the Government appointed a strongCommittee, under the Chairmanship of Lord Desborough, to conduct a full inquiry into the conditions of service of thePolice throughout Great Britain.  On 1st June, 1919, theCommittee issued the first Part of their Report, as a resultof which the standard Desborough scales of pay were grantedwith effect from 1st April, 1919, to the complete and lastingsatisfaction of the men.  The Committee also recommended theinstitution of a complete representative organisation for thePolice throughout the country.  Experience of the working ofthe Metropolitan Police Representative Board had convinced the then Government of the necessity for some representativeorganisation for the Police as a whole,  in which every memberof the lower ranks would have a place and which would be independent of outside Unions;  and in July, 1919, the HomeSecretary introduced a Bill for the purpose, which eventuallybecame the Police Act, 1919.  It was at this juncture thatthe second strike war; called, by the Executive of the PoliceUnion, without warning on 31st July, 1919, the declared object being to force the  Government to withdraw clauses 1-3 of thePolice&quot; Bill then before Parliament and to concede &quot;full and frank recognition of the Union&quot;.  On this occasion seven police forces were affected;  the total number of Police who struckwas about 2,300  (out of a total strength of about 50,090) made up as follows :-&apos;Metropolitan 1,056;  City of London 57;
                             -Si-Liverpool 932; . 31raihghain 118;  Birkenhead 106;  Bootle 35;Vfallasey 1;  with &quot;J4 Prison Officers, out of a total strengthof about 2,000J  ALL THESIS MM HAD BEJ3H V7ARHED THAT REFUSAL of duty WOULD INVOLVE DISMISSAL WITHOUT HOPE OF KBIlTSTATBMSNTiWhen they, struck they were dlsmiased accordingly, and thedecision not to reinstate then has been reiterated by previousadministrations and on grounds which, 1 confess, seem to me,after full examination, very difficult to set aside.   5R  The grounds on which reinstatement has been urged maybe summed up under the following heads j&quot;&apos;      (I)  that the provisions of the Police Bill introduced         in July, . 19191 constituted a breach of the 1918         agreement with the Metropolitan Police,&apos; inasmuch         as it took away the right of the Police to belong         to the Police; Union;     (ii)  that dismissal of the strikers amounted to        &quot;victimisation&quot; wMch ought to be rectified.The first of theses had it been well founded,  would, of course,have been an argument of great weight,- but I find it is in factentirely without foundation.  The 1918 agreement in question -see the Appendix - was three-fold -      Clause A provided for the constitution of a Representative   Board for the ranks of Inspector, Sergeant and Constable in   the Metropolitan police;      Clause B provided &quot;There will be no objection to a member   of the Force joining the National Union of Police and Prison   Officers so long as such Union does not claim or attempt to   interfere with the regulations and discipline of the Service,   or to induce members of the Force to&apos;withhold their services,   but in the event of a broach of this condition members of   the Force may be called upon to sever their connection with   such Union1&apos;/ and      Clause 0 was &quot;The Government will favourably consider the   cases of those men who have been dismissed or fined for   joining the Union.&quot;   6.  Clauoe B, it will be seen, gave permission to  join theUnion subject to the Union not claiming nor attempting to inducemembers of the Force, to withhold their services, and providedthat in the event ofia breach of&apos;this condition members of theForce might be, called upon.to.sever theJYTV.connection^with^theUnion.  At this tine,  the Union Rules contained a clause
specifically excluding any question of withholding services as a means of obtaining redress, and providing that.all differencesshould be arranged or decided by amicable and conciliatory meansWithin six months, however.) of the agreement of 1918 the Unionaltered this Rule so as to provide specifically for the holding of a ballot of members, a majority of two*thirds to authorisethe Executive to call a strike, and in May, 1919* while theDesborough Committee was still sitting,  the Union proceeded totake a ballot of their members throughout the country on thequestions of recognition of the Union, the reinstatement ofP.G. Spackman (who had been dismissed for insubordination),increase of pay and the abolition of military control of thePolice;  the ballot papers to be returnable on 29th May and theresult to be announced at a demonstration at Hyde Park on 1stJune,  In these circumstances, it will be seen, the Governmentwere unquestionably entitledj under the agreement of 1918, tocall upon every policeman who was a member of the Union tosever his connection with that body unconditionally.  When,moreover, the action to that end was taken in the Police bill of 1919, provision was made at the same time to set up acomplete representative system, on a national basis, (which now exists in the Police Federation) and? as already mentioned,the claims of the Police as to their pay,; etc. had already beenfully met under the Desborough award of 1st June.   7.  I am afraid that the plain truth is that the secondPolice Strike amounted to a complete repudiation by the Policeconcerned of their side of the settlement upon which the firststrike had been concluded less than a year before,  and thisafter the obligations undertaken by the Government under that settlement had already been more than fully implemented,&apos;   8o  As to the suggestion of victimisation,  it will be seen from what has been said, how entirely different the circumstanceof the 1919 strike were from any industrial dispute or even thefirst Police Strike0  The sudden withdrawal from duty with the
avowed object of forcing the hand of the Government on a matterthen before - Parliament must be regarded as such a breach of discipline and of the obligations of the Police to the public as would in any circumstances have merited dismissal,  and itwas committed in breach of the agreement which the Police union representatives had entered into and in disregard of the plainwarning of the consequences which would ensue..   9.  There were other circumstances,  of secondary importance,which have some bearing on the question, such as the difficultiesin the working of the Metropolitan Police Representative Boardset up under Clause A of the 1918 agreement,  and the  very gravereaction on the discipline of the Metropolitan Police, and to aless extent of other Forces, which resulted from the actions ofthe Police Union leaders in the period between the strikes,This is a long story and 1 only mention,, by way of example, thepublic demonstrations held in Trafalgar Square and elsewhere atwhich superior officers of the Metropolitan Police were attacked by speeches and placards,  and the open and approving reference made in. the Police Union Magazine to the theft of confidentialdocuments, including a confidential letter written by a chief constable and apparently stolen from his office by one of theUnion members.   10.  Even if reinstatement could be clearly justified on the merits, I should be faced with very great practical difficulties!in giving effect to such a policy after the lapse of nearly fiveyears.  The appointment of any man who has been dismissed froma Police Force is at present specifically barred by theStatutory Regulations governing the conditions of service ofthe Police.  Any amendment of the Regulations must, by Statute,be submitted to the Police Council, and any proposal to abrogatethe provision in question would undoubtedly meet with strenuousopposition.  The position, too, ir. much more complicated than ifit were only a question of taking back a few young Constables who could be readmitted as ordinary recruits., for the strikers include
many men of long service who are now far beyond the maximum ageof entry and must in some cases have reached the normalretiring age, and it is precisely in these cases that the claimbased on hardship is the strongest.  It must be remembered .further that other Forces besides the Metropolitan police are involved, and in the case of those Forces I have no power ofdismissal or of appointment, these powers resting entirely with the local Police Authorities.,  The Police Authorities,moreover. were assured when the strike was threatened in 1919that all members of the Metropolitan Police would be dismissedand would in no circumstances be permitted to rejoinj. and thatPolice Authorities who took similar action might count on thesupport of the Government.   11.  The records of the events of 1919 make it abundantly clear that the incidents to which I have briefly referred, forwhich the Police Union must be held responsible,, had seriouslyundermined the discipline,, morale, and efficiency of theMetropolitan Police,, and. to a less extent some of the otherForceso  Tho legitimate grievances of the Polife had alreadybeen, or were being, rectified when the strike took place.  Toa great extent the Force has now regained its morale, and I amassured that the dismissal of those who took part in the strike of 1919 undoubtedly contributed very materially to this, result,   12.  The Police Federation, a complete representative systemof the ranks of Inspector, Sergeant and Constable in all Forces,established under the Act of 1919,, is proving quite successful.The Federation stands consistently for constitutional methods,and it would be necessary to consider very carefully the effecton the position of the Federation of condoning the action ofthose who, rejecting constitutional methods, engineered thestrike of 1919 against the institution of the Federation.  TheFederation certainly were not prepared in 1920 to give anycountenance to the demand for reinstatement and ljj am told thatthere is no reason to think that their attitude would be
different to-day - and indeed that reinstatement of the strikerswould be greatly resented by many of the men,  particularly inthe County Forces, who regarded the events of  1919 as hayingdisgraced their Service.   13.  1 have to remember,  also, that I am not only the police authority for tho Metropolitan Police, but have statutoryresponsibility for the supervision of the County and BoroughPolice Forces in regard,  inter alia,&apos;to the efficient maintenanceof discipline by the responsible local Police  Authorities.  It -is true that the administration of discipline  by these authorities is now such that the Home Office has comparatively rare occasion to take exception to the  proceedings of any particular Authority.That is a state of things which it is, of course, of supreme importance to maintain;   and it is clear to me that, havingregard to the circumstances in which the strike of 1919 tookplace and the assurance and support which the  Local Authoritiesreceived, I could not assume the responsibility of suggesting, oreven countenancing, the reinstatement of the dismissed strikerswithout most seriously compromising my ,position.   14.  My natural sympathies would be with the strikers and itis with great regret that I find myself unable, after very careful examination, to put a better complexion on their case.  I feelthat I oan only submit the matter as it has presented itself tome to my colleagues and invite their counsels.A. H.31st  March,  If PA,
