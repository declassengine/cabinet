US. DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT). j84(24)^1                 CABINET.              HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT *             Condition of Stonework*   Memorandum by the First Comrais 3i6ner of Works -          I circulate herewith, for the information of mycolleagues,  an interim report by Sir Frank Baines, theDIreotor of Works of my Department, regarding the decayof stonework at the Houses of Parliament.  Evidences ofdecay were observed as early as seven years after theerection of the building, but the disintegration, althoughcontinuous,  has only recently become really serious,particularly in connection with the decorative portions of the stoneworks  Owing to (l) the use of an\xnsatisfactory stone particularly liable to fracture,(2) the disintegrating action of the atmosphere, and(3) the rusting of the iron dowels, standards and bars5most of the decorative stonework Is fracturing andcrumbling away, and it Is only a matter of time beforethe whole building will be denuded of its decorativefeatures. ^ In view of the interest which the House is certain to take in this question, I think that theCabinet should know the policy which I propose to adopt.          The problem roughly resolves itself Into 3 parts(a) the prevention of decay, (b) the removal of pieces ofdecayed and fractured stone, particularly those which areIn danger of falling, and (c) the replacement of thestonework which has been removed.
     (a)  Prevention of decay.&apos;  No satisfactory stonepreservative has yet been discovered,  but investigationsare being carried out by a special Committee under theDepartment of Scientific and Industrial Research,  aid myDepartment is kept fully Informed of the results of theirenquiries.  It seems certain,  however, that the decay willcortinue until it is possible, by smoke abatement  or other means,  to effect a general improvement in the Londonatmosphere.     (b)  The removal of decayed and fractured stone.  Asum of  3,500 is taken in the  Estimates for 1924/25 for thepurpose of continuing the process of handpicking pieces ofdecayed and fractured stone, particularly in places wherethey are likely to become dangerous, and a larger sum willprobably be required in future years.   The greater partof the cost is for the provision of scaffolding.     (c)  Replacement of stone which has been rempyed.  by far the most difficult problem with which the Department isfaced is that relating to the  portions of the buildingwhich have been mutilated by the constant removal  ofdecorative features in the stonework.   The only permanentlysatisfactory method of dealing with the stonework  would beto replace the whole of the fractured  and decaying stoneby a more durable stone, but although this would involve an expenditure of some hundreds of thousands 1 of&apos;pounds,it is impossible to leave the  building in its presentmutilated state, and I accordingly propose to consider carefully a scheme which would enable  the necessaryrepairs to be carried out over a number of years,   It maybe necessary to include provision for  the commencementof the work in the Estimates for 1925/26.
it          When I have received a detailed report  which  isnow being prepared by Sir Frank Bainos,  I will  considerthe advisability of publishing the whole or a portion ofit in the form of a White Paper.          I also Intend to consult the Fine ArtsCommission on the extent to which it is  necessary or desirable that the characteristic external features ofthe building (including the elaborate ornamentation)should be preserved in any scheme of repair which may beundertaken.

 HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.CONDITION OF STONEWORK.     BRIEF REVIEWo                 740          In 1838 the Lords Commissioners of the TreasuryInstituted an enquiry with regard to the selection of stonefor the above.   The Commissioners appointed presented areport in 1859 after visiting 105 Quarries and inspectingnumerous public buildings.  They recommended a magnesiumlime stone for the work.          They also recommended a particular Quarry namely&quot;Boloover Moor&quot;3   This Quarry was opened and found unfit for the purpose .of providing stone on account of thethinness and uneven character of the beds.   FinallyAnstore stone was used, quarried in Yorkshire on landbelonging to the Duke cf Leeds,  Difficulty was experienced in obtaining an abundant supply of stone of sufficientdepth of bod, 3ize and quality, and a Quarry at MansfieldWoodhouse was next resorted to.          Here again the supply was not equal to thedemand, and the Anstone Quarry was reverted to.          Early complaints arose with regard to theinferior quality of certain of the Anstone stone -used anddecay in the stonework appeared as early as 184-7, and in1854 the treatment for decay began.          A Committee was appointed In 1861 to enquire into the decay of the stone, but the Committee concernedthemselves largely with surface decay rather than the majortrouble of failure due to  (a) lines cf cleavage, (b) splitting               &amp;c.,due to  iron rods/and  (c) decay due to the stone being wronglybedded,                       1.
2.         Magnesium lime stone is probably one.of the worststones which could be used in an acid-laden atmosphere,Its use is all the more serious and dangerous when a building is designed with elaborate Gothic detail with themajority of the external surfaces enriched with mouldingssdecoration and high relief carving,,  There are five majorerrors in construction of the Houses of Parliament -   (l)a0  The use of a Magnesium lime stone, subject           as it is to drastic attack from sulphuric           acid in the atmosphere.,      b.  The use of a particular Magnesium lime stone           subject to &quot;planes of cleavage&quot; which cause           serious and dangerous fractures in tho stone,      c,  A stone which does not- give sufficient depth           of bed to allow of stone for shafts, etc, and           carving to he obtained without &quot;false bedding&quot;,   (2)    The introduction of wrought iron as a means of           dowelling the beds of the stone used and the           introduction of iron vanes and standards           throughout a large area of the building, causing           bursting of the stone by rusting of the iron,,   (3)    The use of free, lime in securing slate dowels in           the stonework, causing bursting of the stone.   (4)    The wrong bedding of tile stone, resulting in decay           and fracture.   (5)    The unsatisfactory method of the use of stone in           a great deal of the enriched work  of the building.          The problem*is a very serious one,  inasmuch as partial repair cannot deal with the problem as thestone cleaves ^and fails beyond the point  of repair,  Thesplitting and fracturing of the stone involve largemasses.  Some of the fallen pieces have weighed as muchas 250  lbs, falling from positions such as the wallsabove the entrance of St. Stephen&apos;s Porch, the West front of the  Victoria Tower and the South Front of  the Clock Tower.
                                                    7/5 9          The decay is not due to neglect as the buildings have been watched with extreme caro, which has been difficultinasmuch as not more than 5fo of the total wall area is accessible from ground or roof level.  Up to 1919 theDepartment had only examined small portions of the wallsurfaces, removing fractured sections and repairing andrefixing portions of the stonework.          A large fall of masonry from the main entrance to the Victoria Tower and also from the South Front of theClock Tower called the Department1s attention to the serious danger involved to Members of Parliament and the general public passing around and beneath tho walls; and in 1980 thopolicy of the Department was altered; that is to say, repairwas suspended and a programme was laid down for tho examinationfrom temporary scaffolds as far as possible, from time to timeof the whole of the external surfaces of the buildings, sothat a consistent view of the whole problem could he made,and all loose and fractured&quot; portions of the stonework beremoved by &quot;hand-picking&quot;.  The polioy adopted was a &quot;safetyfirst&quot; policy,and its value was that it also gave adequate means for ascertaining the general condition of the whole of thebuildings; and some idea can now be formed of the magnitude ofthe problem; while photographs and records have been takenillustrating the condition of the stonework as found.          By Midsummer of this year, the whole of the wallsurfaces  of the building will have been reviewed.  The totalweight of fractured and decayed stone removed by hand is from 29 to 30 tons.          The expenditure on this work to date has beenroughly  27,000, and  the time has now arrived to considerthe whole problem and  to decide upon a course of action.3.1
The danger existing is still very grave, in view of thofact that planes of cleavage appear sometimes only a fewmonths after a thorough examination, and sections of thework passed as reasonably safe are afterwards found to contain detatched fragments of stonework, constituting a grave risk.          Although the Terrace Front, for example, was completely examined and rendered safe in 1916, and allfractured and loose stones were removed from time to time by an examination from the roof, after that date,approximately 5 tons of additional loose and fracturedpieces of stonework were removed in 1920-21,          It Is clear, therefore, that the process of&quot;hand picking&quot; although a safeguard, would have to becontinuous to be fully effective and if such a policy were adopted, the building would rapidly represent amutilated appearance, and considerable sums of money would be expended without effectively dealing with theproblem,          The huge area of the Houses of Parliament is part of the difficulty.  There are approximately900,000 feet super of external stone surfaces in thebuilding, and approximately 850,000 cubic feet ofstone in the external vra,lls.  The conditions whichmust direct any scheme of repair should be somewhatas follows:-      (a)  That the architectural character of the           building must not be altered.      (b)  That the character of the detail and its           elaborate ornament should be preserved,      (c)  That, materials used for renewal and repair           should harmonise with the existing stone,      (d)  That such materials should be more           durable than the Anstone stone..         \\                                                   i      (e)  That the scheme will provide for the -           elimination of all the wrought iron bars,           vanes, standards and dowels wherever           possible,
          Those conditions oeem to Imply the use of a proved                            .  &apos;                     suitableand&apos;durable stono for&apos;repairs  such as a good sandstone/forcarving and not subject to the defects of the AnatoneMagnesium lime stone.          The work would take  probably from ten to fifteen years to complete and might cost any sum, (such as halfto throe-quarters of a million pounds sterling).  It is indeed impossible to estiraato the cost, as the character ofthe work alone must dictate the extent of the repair andrenewal.  Structurally, the building appears to be sound and is admirably foundationed and enacted;, &quot;out the larger proportion of all the turretsj, cupolas and subsidiarytowers will probably have to be renewed and rebuilt.          The problem will be complicated by the greatcost of the scaffolds required for the repair.  Forexample the Central Tower is 350 feet high, the VictoriaTower is 1530 feet high and all these Towers &quot;will have tobe scaffolded to deal with the repair adequately,  A greatdeal of the exaninatiori and hand-picking) however, hasbeen conducted from  &quot;cradles&quot;.          The character of certain of tlie ornament asshown by the photographs is not such as should everhave been permitted  in stone.  Certain of the halfrelief crowns consist of large masses of stono 18&quot; onthe face, 18&quot; deep and with 12&quot; projections.  They arecarved froe of tho face of the building so that thewhole of the interior of tho  crown is cut away and itsconnection with  tho  building, therefore, if,  only on three sides, on  very small areas.  Many of these crownscan be pullod away bodily by  hand, and owing to theirweight and size  they constitute a grave danger.  Much ofthe  other  ornament is of a similar character, and its veryelaboration contributes to the clanger and difficulty of
repair,  It is thought, however, that this difficulty canbe overcome by preserving the character of the ornament,while varying the method of its carving and bedding intothe walls o          Ho system of applying stcne preservatives coulddeal with the problem, even if satisfactory preservativeswere known to existD  Surface decay if, of course, apparenteverywhere, but this is not the problem which faces theDepartment!,  It is proposed to detail to tho first commissioner in a complete report, the whole of the factsconnected with the question, and, if It is thought dssirablsuch a report could he placed upon the table of the Houseof Commons  for the information of Members.  It is desirablehowever, that, before the next financial year, some decision should be arrived at as to how the problem shallbe dealt with0                               (Intldj F-.Bg                                      12/3/24.
