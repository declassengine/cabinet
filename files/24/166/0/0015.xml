jfflS  DOCUMENT  IS   IBS  PEOPERTY   OF  HIS   BBITAHNJC  MAJESTY^                           GOVERMEHT,,IBIER3SA.TIOM3J  .LABOUB  OFFICE.BUDGET  FOB  1925,memorandum by the Minister of labourD CBffJ,            2)be Estimates of the International labour Office forpXl5(24).           1925 have recently been circulated to Members of the           Governing Body for oxamination and will come before the           Finance Committee end the Governing Body at Geneva for           adoption, with or without modification, in the first fort-           night of April.   These Estimates, as now drafted, amount           in all to 7,574,203 Swiss francs  (approximately  300,000),           of which the share of Great Britain is approximately one-           tenth, or some  30,000.   The corresponding figure for the           Estimates of the previous year (1924) is 7,032,295 francs,           but of this sum 200 ,.000 francs represents non-recurring           expenditure (compensation for dismissed staff) and the           true comparison is as between 7,574,203 francs and           approximately 6-f million franca.                The Estimates for 1924 as originally drafted by the           Office amounted to 9,118,000 francs which compares with           an expenditure of 7,275,000 francs in 1923.   A careful           enquiry, conducted at the request of the Director by the           director of Establishments of the Ministry of labour,           confirmed&apos; the view of the late Government that there was           great extravagance in the administration of the Office           and it was largely on their initiative that the           Governing Body last year reduced the Estimate to the           neighbourhood of seven million francs.   I myself am                                                           /satisfied
satisfied that, notwithstanding the pressure v/hioh is brought upon the Director to appoint representatives ofparticular nationalities and the political problems                      *inseparable from an organisation of this kind,  there iastill room for substantial economy without interfering with legitimate developments of the activities  of theOffice.     I therefore propose to instruct the british representative on the Governing Body to make strong representations at the meeting next month that  theBudget should not exceed 7,000,000 francs, and  not to&apos;vote for a Budget exceeding that amount.     The Treasury, who have been consulted, concur and unless sny of my colleagues dissent on or before Monday,31st instant, I propose to give instructions accordingly.                                  (Intd.)  I. S.Miniatry of labour. 6th Msrch, 1924.
