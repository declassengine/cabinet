  Education  (Scotland)(Superannuation)  Bill.                 MEMORANDUM.    This Bill proposes to extend until 31st March, 1926,the operation of the Education (Scotland) (Superannua-tion)  Act,  1922.  The  Act,  which was  a temporary measure, modifying for a period of two years the Educa-tion (Scotland)  (Superannuation) Act, 1919, was rendered necessary &quot;by the passing of the School Teachers (Super-annuation)  Act, 1922,  which  applied to England only.Like the English Act, it became law on the understandingthat during the interval the whole subject of teachers&apos;superannuation would  be enquired into by a  Depart-mental Committee.  The Committee  has now  reported and has made unanimous  recommendations.   As  soonas  the permanent  measure for  England is framed,  apermanent measure for Scotland, similar in all essentials,will follow immediately.  The  temporary Act,  however,expires on  31st May next, and the extension  proposedin  the present Bill is  required for  consideration andadjustment of  the details of the new arrangement.  Theprovision embodied in  Clause 2 follows  the principle ofSection  6 of the Education (Scotland)  (Superannuation)Act, 1919.93-3a
