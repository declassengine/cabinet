She following Memorandum is circulate3 with reference    to CP.  217(84)  ana  must be taken merely as a preliminary    expression  of view which the Department may wish to  supplement   later.  The  Memorandum is confined  to  questions  of policy.  Botes   upon  certain  points  of  detail  will bo circulated  at  the meeting   of the Committee of  Home Affairs.   8,    The scheme of the  Bill is broadly  to constitute  statutory   Committees  county by county which will  for  all  practical purposes   be wage fixing authorities.  There will, however, be two checks   to ensure that wages should be actually  fixed and to prevent   a  deadiockt-         (a)  an  independent Chairman must be appointed either by             the Committee  itself or, failing  the appointment             by the Committee, by the Minister, but this Chairman             will only have a vote at the discretion of the             Committee;         (b)   in cases where the Committee have fixed no rate, the             Central Wages Board will be in existenoe which will             be able to impose the rats upon the district after             a certain period,.        The co-ordinating and confirming body  for wages throughout.   the country will be a Central Wages Board constituted on the   same general lines as Trade Boards*        It is further provided that minimum rates shall be criminally   enforoible and that the procedure for prosecution shall follow   the Trade Board precedent except in one important particular.   This particular is that it is  contemplated in the Bill that the   inspectors whose duty it is to  enforce will be under the Juris-   diction of the &quot;Wages  Board and  not of the Minister and that   consequently proceedings will,  as a general rule,  be  Initiated   not by tho Minister but by the  Wages  Board.                                -1-
                                                             9,9                                                             0 u   3,   It is further- indicated that in the natter of rates theCommittee  shall have the  power to fix: minimum rates for time-workers engaged in agriculture and for workers engaged in piecewo*k.   Theso rates will  be  of universal application within thearea to which they apply  unless specifically provide! to thecontrary and subject to power to exempt agefi and infirm workers.     The Bill contemplates (though the memorandum accompanying itdoubts whether this provision should be maintained) that thereshould he  a fixed minimum rate of 30/- throughout the country which would he the general underpinning rate.   4o   The Department have  already indicated to the agricultural committee that they view  with alarm the possibility of recreatinga wage fixing authority whose decisions are penally enforciblewithout invoking the responsihility of Parliament.    The centralprinciple of the Trade Boards Acts is that, while the Beardsthemselves for each trade shall have the full responsibility for fixing the right wages for that trade, it shall remain withthe Minister as responsible  to Parliament and to the genei*alpublic to soe that those  rates are in fact rates that are in thepublic interest.  In tills way, while complete power is left tothe trade to deal with its own affairs, there is as a lastresource, recourse to Parliament against unjust or inexpodieirtdecisions.  Under the procedure proposed in the Bill, parliament will have no say in the matter whatever.  If the action of the boards or Committees is challenged, as it is hound to be challengein the course of its work, there can be no appeal beyond theCentral -ages ,ioard, which will have absolute power.   In thisway complete legislative  control over wages and therefore overconditions flowing from wages would be in the hands of a b^xlynot res;,onsiblo to Parliament and the ordinary democratic pro-tection provided by parliament for both farmers and workers would he denied,
      It should be  noted in passing that no eon?iris on can bo drawn between this body and such body as an elected local authority.    In any event it is  inevitable that a  large proportion  of the  persons whose  affairs v/ill be governed by it  being  unorganised will have no direct representation. Accordingly,  in the case of a  specific county,  it may well happen that  the  affairs of a large minority may be settled by the decision  of the  majority.    This  decision will be  final, subject to  the  appaal to the Central  Wages Board,  which in turn nay actually  represent tho  minority of the persons in the country,,     So long  as  tho  Central 7agos Bo.-a.rd remains the  confiraing authority it  is  clear that enforcement and inspection must be under  the control  of that Board  and not of  the  Minister, bo cause its experience  under the Trade Boards Acts has  shewn conclusively  that  the power to inspect and enforce must  reside with the power  to  con fir n.   If  the Central &apos;.Yages  Board is  not made the confirming  authority  tho Minister  bias elf would naturally assume both tho  enforcing and  inspecting functions.Apart from  this general  point  of  policy  the  other sain  point is the  question of  the  minimum wageo    Upon  this point  theDepartment is in agreement  with  the aemorandum  and not  with theBill.   In arriving  at  this  view  importance is  attached to  two points which are both touched  on  in the Memorandum  CP.217(24) circulated by the Minister  of Agriculture  -,nd Fisheries namely-.            (1)  that  it  is almost  impossible  in  effect to fix                  one figure to -poly  to conditions which                  constantly vary and  that  it is the* essence of                  reasonable wage filing carrying statutory                  penalties  to provide  as much  elasticity as                  possible.,    If any figure  were inserted in                   the Bill -provision would  have to be made  for                  variation  from time  to time according  to                  circums tan cos.
(2)  While  the  effeot of a statutory SO/- would     undoubtedly lamellately increase the wages     of a number ef workers It would immediately     decrease or tend to decrease the wages of a     large number of workers oaiefly in the     northern counties, who are in reoeipt of     more than 30/- at the present moment.liatry  of labour.
