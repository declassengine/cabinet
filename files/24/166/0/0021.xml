CRBT,:                           CABINET.jp. 220,A.(24)AGRICULTURAL WAGES (REGULATION&quot;) BILL.    ITotes by the Mlnistry of Labour.(Circulated  in  continuation of the  Memorandum by the         Ministsy of Labour -  CP.  220  (24).)
AGRICULTURAL WAGES BILL.preliminary Notes by the Ministry of Labour on points                of detail.(1)   Minimum wage for time workers and piece workers.     As the Bill stands it appears that where in respeot ofpiece workers no piece rate has been fixed the time rate would not bfc criminally enforceable.  The only method of recovery would be by way of civil proceedings on theapplication of tho worker to the Committee.   it is suggestedthat it might be provided that the minimum time rate shouldbe the basis, enforceable by criminal proceedings; for the .remuneration of piece work unless a piece rate has been fixed, thus automatically providing a remedy where nopiece rate had been fixed.   It seems to be necessary bysome means to ensure that there will be a criminallyenforceable minimum rate for piece workers.(S)   notice of fixing, cancelling or varying rates.     provision is made to give a fortnight&apos;s notice for fixing,  cancelling or varying rates and a further monthmay elapse while the Central Wages Board is considering therates.  Upon this it may perhaps be questioned whether therelative periods of time are reasonable unless what is notexpressed is intended, namely, that objections may belodged with the Central Board after the Looal Coramittoehad fixed the rate./It
      It  should,  however,  he  rioted that when the  Central Board under  Clause  6  instructs  a  local  Committee to  fix, vary  or  canoel a rate there  is  no provision as to notice of this  aotlon0   It  is presiunsd  that some  such  notioe is intended  and  it  is suggested that this should be explicitly dealt with.    She same point arises on the power vested on the Central Wages Board to refer  back  a rate with  the right to insist  that the Committee  shall accept its recommendations.   This may mean that the Central Board overrides  the Local Committee without  giving the farmers or labourers in the county  any opportunity of considering  or objecting  to the new proposal. (I)  Relations of Board and Committee.      It is provided by the Bill that the Central  Board may fix a rate for a county area if after two months  after the establishment of the County Committee no rate has been fixed.This  period would seem to be unduly short having  regard tothe obvious  difficulties  of fixing an Initial rate and thetime  which may be expeoted to elapse at the  outset of any nowundertaking of  this kind.     The effect of the provisions of the Bill with regard tothe Central Board and the local Committee is to set up tworival wage-fixing authorities.    Under the Trade  Boards Actsthe Minister1 s sole po^er is to refer wages back where he isof opinion that It would not be In the public interest to confirm.    Under the procedure  contemplated  in the bill the Central Board can not only  fix rates upon their own initiative but oan upon their own Initiative alter the ratesfixed by the  Looal Committee.   This would appear to  offerconsiderable  opportunity for friction between the LooalCommittees and the Central Board.
(4) Constitution of Board and Committees.     It Is stated that the method of appointing thorepresentative Bides of the Committee shall be fixed by regulation and shall be either by nomination orelection.   This wording is practically the wording oftho Trado Boards Acts.   In practice the regulations under the Trade Boards Aots definitely provide thatthe Minister shall have the responsibility for con-stltuting tho Board,   in faot he makes nominationsfrom representative Assooiatione on both sides but he regards it as vital to retain tho power to socurerepresentation for the unorganised and to see that amongthe organised all interests aro fully and oquallyrepresented.   It is suggested that the Minister ofAgriculture should in tho course of debate give an assurance that the method of appointing representativemembers of the Board and Committees will in practice -follow these lines.
