 2,    In accordance with  tho  above  Cabinet doeisionfO fs the  Committee  have given careful consideration to the  Postmaster General&apos;s Memorandum (C.P.-226(24)), also  to a  Memorandum prepared by Mr.  Donald,  the Chairman of  the Imperial Wireless  Telegraphy Committee  (I.W, (24) 2)  and  to the Telegrams  on Imperial Wireless which  have been  interchanged,  at various times  between His Majesty1 s Governmsnt and the Governments  of the Dominions.   The following recommendations are  submitted to the  Cabinet. 3.   We are  of the opinion that the prinoiple  of stats- owned Wireless Stations  in Great Britain,  as reoommendec. In the Report  of the Imperial  Wireless Telegraphy Committee, should be adopted for cotmiuni cation with the  Oversea  Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates and Territories.    We consider that it Is  desirable thai this principle  should apply  to wireless  communicationwith all the Dominions,  Including  Canada,  and  oonse- quently wo reoonanend that the  alternative  suggestion In Recommendation 3  of the Report  of  the ImperialWirelesB Telegraphy  Committee  should  not be adopted. 4.   In order  to Oarry out these recommendations,  the following  approximate financial commitments will be necessary  for  the year 1924-25.     For the  extension of the  present    leafield Station, approximately      60,000.    For the  extension of the high-    power  station new building at    Rugby, approximately                 60,000.     The cost of a site for a  second    high-power wireless  station     at Rugby,  approximately               50,000.     In order  to proceed with  this  scheme  a total, therefore, of  approximately   200,000 will  suffice  for the year 19 24/25.    It may be  noted that the total cost of the second  station at Rugby will be,,  approximately,- 500,000,   but  as this station  will be  required
concurrently with the high-power station in India,which oannot be commenced until the Autumn, it isonly necessary immediately to provide for the oost ofthe 8itee5.   We have given careful consideration to the correspondence lately addressed to members of HisMajesty&apos;s Government by the Marooni Company in whichthey request an opportunity may be given them of expressing their views to His Majestyfs Government.We are of the opinion that it would be  equitable andoorrect for the Company to have an opportunity ofstating their oase? beforo the final decision of theGovernment is announced.   To this end we suggestthat this Committee should bo authorised by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to meet representatives of the marconi Company and to negotiate with tho Company onthe following lines:-    (a)  That the principle of State ownership of         stations in Great Britain for Wireless         communications with tho Empire is decided upon    (b)  That the ownership and administration of         Wireless stations in the Dominions is similarl         left entirely for decision by the Governments&apos;         of the Dominions,    (o)  That the State-owned stations in Great Britain         will be prepared to provide an efficient and         satisfactory service for Wireless communicatif.         with any stations erected In the Dominions.6.   As regards Wlreloss communications between GreatBritain and foreign contries, the Oommitteo are ofopinion that this should be open to private enterpriseas  heretofore:- under licence issued by tho PostmasterGeneral.
01&apos;&apos;    7.    The Committee recommend to the Cabinet:-(l)    Tb-1 the -principle should he adopted   of State ownership and operation of all   wireless stations in Great Britain for   communication with the Overseas Dominions   (including Canada), Colonies, Protectorates   and Territories.
