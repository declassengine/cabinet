CABINET.                     81EMERGENCY  COMMITTEE,CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting held in the Ministers&apos;Conference Room, House of Commons at 4-30 p.m,  on          Wednesday, March 26th, 1924,          The Committee had under consideration the     situation that  would  be  likely  to  arise  from the     threatened stoppage of the  Underground Service     on Fridaj and came to the following conclusions I.  Proclamation  of Emergency.          It  was agreed that  arrangements  should be made     for a Meeting of the  Privy  Council to be held on     Friday afternoon,  the 28th  instant, with a  view to the     issue of a Proclamation  declaraing a  state  of Emergency.     It Is suggested that  the terms  of  the Proclamation     should be as  stated in Appendix A.          The Committee considered the  existing  Code of     Emergency Regulations and agreed that only  those     Regulations which  are set out in Appendix  B (to be     circulated separately) should be brought into operation.     It was pointed  out that  a Proclamation having once been     made  it  was always open  to  the  Government to  make further     Regulations without further  Proclamation should the     occasion require,,11,  Organisation  of alternative  Transport  Facilities.          It  Was agreed after a  long discussion  that the Govern-     ment  should confine its  activities to  providing means for     the transportation of Government employees.           *          The Ministry  of  Transport  had prepared a scheme for     this  purpose  whereby  omnibuses  were to operate along     certain  fixed routes  with fixed stopping places.   The     Committeewere of opinion, however, that it would be unwise     to  use  omnibuses for  this ouroose       /and                                 -1-
Q O0 /,     and that it would be nmoh better for the Ministry of     Transport,  while retaining in essentials their old scheme,     to make arrangements that charabancs should  be made use of     instead of  onmibusosa          As regards  the General Public,  it  was  agreed  that  all     the Government could  do would  be  to  offer adequate protection     to any  bus,  tube or tram   services that  found  themselves able     to run  and  to make  a general appeal  to  the motor-owning     public  to render any assistance in their  power..III.  Protection.          It  was pointed  out to  the Committee  and the Committee     agreed  that the  protection  which  the Government should  offer     could not be provided by  the ordinary police services arid     that  it  would he  necessary  to  employ special.,  constables,1V-   Power, Stations          In the event of the  stoppage of the  Power  Statics s, the     Committee agreed  that it  was the  duty of  the GovernmentVto -see     that  London was  not left  without motive power  or light.     Por this purpose  it was necessary to make use  of laval men,     under the scheme  that has been prepared.  As it would take     a  considerable time to ge\,  the- Naval men  into position if     action  were delayed until the last moment, it was  agreed     that  preparations should  be begun by the Admiralty at once     for having  the necessary men at hand, but that no  emergency     action  should be  taken until after the Proclamation.Whitehall  Gard ens. b.W.1,,        March 26th, 19U;,
