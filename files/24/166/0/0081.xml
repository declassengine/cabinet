,261(24).(This doourant  is the Property of His Di*itannlo MajectyTs Goverrmsnt),    C A,B,I H E T.  ;HOME AFFAIRS OOMJOTTES:.656FAOTORtES BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE HOME SECRETARY.      I desire to obtain the approval of the Home Affaire .Committee to the annexed Bill to amend and consolidate  theFactory and Workshop Acts.      The main object of the Bill is to bring the Factory Actsinto conformity with modem conditions and ideas.    Twenty-three years have elapsed since the principal Factory Act atpresent in fort*e - the Factory and Workshop Act,  1901,  - waspassed;  and as a result of the great advance during thatperiod in the knowledge of the conditions of health and safety and of the new movements in industry originating  from the War(e.g. the introduction of the eight hour day and  the welfaremovement) the present law is in many respects quite out of date^      There are besides many matters on which the need for exten-sions of the Act has long been felt, as, for example,  in respectof buildirlg operations and works of construction.    A committee reported on the dangers attending building operations so long ago as 1907, and another Committee reported on one  very dangerousclass of work of construction, namely deep excavations, in1912.   It has not hitherto been possible to carry  out  theserecommendation e.     . Other matters dealt with in the Bill which  have long beenwaiting for further legislation are the regulation  of under-ground workrooms;  the requirement of improved lighting of work;rooms  (in accordance with the recommendations of  the FactoryLighting Committee);  the prevention of fire  (in  accordance withthe Report of  the Royal Commission on Fire Prevention);  the
extension of what is known as the particulars clause&apos; toall piece workers;  and the application of the full       6^7provisions of the Acts to Workshops in whioh only men areemployed.      I see no reason to think- that the Bill in its broadoutlines will be treated as controversial by any Party, -the Bill was promised in the King5s Speech by the late government - but it contains one or two proposals of a controversial character.   X may mention, in particular,those (l) for giving every person employed in a factoryan annual holiday on full pay of not less than six consecutive-tive days for every twelve months continuous service with the came employer;  (2) for requiring a weekly rest of notless than twenty four hours to be given to every workerbetween 6 p.m. on Saturday and 6 a.m. on Monday;   and  (3)for prohibiting night work in the  baking industry.  Briefnotes on these and other important proposals in the bill are appended below.       It may be asked how far the effect of the Bill willbe to place any additional charge upon the Exchequer or to throw on the industries affected any burden whioh is likelyto handicap them under the present unfavourable conditionsof trade.   So far as the Exchequer is concerned, the. Billplaces no*&apos;new direct or immediate charge upon it, but anumber of new duties will fall upon the Factory Inspectorsand the scope of the Act is being considerably extended bythe inclusion of buildingss engineering works, and other premises.   If the Bill is passed, I think the government must contemplate a considerable addition to the staff of the inspector and I should propose, as soon as the Bill is passed, to appoint a Committee - to consider the matter.      As regards industry generally, the main object of thenew legislation will be to improve existing standards,
especially in tho establishments which are&apos;backward,,&apos; butthe full application of the Act can only be proceeded w^tjtiggrad.ue.lly, and will be the work of years,  and there is noreason to suppose that any intolerable burden will beplaced on industry as a result of the Bill,NOTES OB TEE CHIEF PROPOSALS.General      The distinctions in the existing Acts betweenfactories and workshops and between textile and  non-textile factories are abolished as no longer necessary.All these works will, in the future,, be classed asfactories and treated :(except as otherwise provided) onthe same footing.   It is also proposed that workshopswhere men only are employed, which have hitherto beenexempted from some of, the most important of the health pro-visions (e.g, as to.ventilation, temperature and sanitaryconveniences) shall be brought within the full operationof the Act.           Part 1.  Health  (general Provisions),      The provisions as to  cleanliness are made more specific o.g. in regard to  removal of dust and the cleaningof floors^(Clause 2).   The amount of cubic space perperson is increased from 250 to 400  [Clause 3).   Power isgiven to prescribe standards of temperature and prohibituse of unsuitable modes of  heating  (Clause 4).  provision is.made for requiring sufficient and suitable lightingand giving, power to prescribe standards of lighting ..(Clause 6)..  The Home.Office standard of sanitary accom-modation is made to apply to all districts.   (Clause 8).      It is proposed (Clause 9) to transfer to the Fas toryDepartment the present responsibility of the localauthorities for the sanitary conditions of &quot;workshops&quot;
except in the case of premises which form part of a     659dwelling house or shop, or are adjacent to a dwelling house or shop in the same occupation.   This will,tend tosecure more efficient enforcement of the law and shouldnot involve the appointment of additional staff, theFactory Inspectors already visiting the premises for thegeneral purposes of the Acts and inspecting the sanitaryconditions as well as  :other matters.   Where however alocal authority is.enforcing the law energetically, it may-lie found desirable to continue the present arrangement;, asthe local authority&apos;&apos;s officers being on the spot can visit the premises more frequently, and it is therefore&apos; proposedto authorise the Home Office to arrange with any localauthority for the enforcement by it of all or any of thesanitary provisions in the case of works where no mechanicalpower is used (i.e, those which are &quot;workshops&quot; under the&apos;existing Act).   A new clause is also introduced  (Clause  12)giving power to the Secretary of State in the case of anyfactory or class of factories where there is an excessiveamount of sickness, to requjre the provision of specialmedical supervision or other special health precautions.The object of this clause, which is on the lineB of thesimilar provision already in force as to safe ty (see Clause34) is to deal with industries such as the boot and shoeand pointing, where,owing to the conditions of work, thereis a special incidenoe of tuberculosis and other diseases.The need for some such power was strongly urged at aDeputation I received from the National Union of Boot andShoe Operatives,          Part II.__Safety (General Provisions).      The safety provisions have been almost entirelyrecast.   Entirely.new provisions are inserted (Clauses 13 -29) imposing duties on manufacturers in regard to  theconstruction of new madiinery;   providing for the  fencingmm
of vessels containing dangerous liquids,, maintenance ofpassages and stairs and  safe means of a,coess to places of  nnnwork;  requiring precautions in the  caso of hoists, lifts,chains, steam receivers,  compressed  air receivers, work intanks and vats, and other matters.      The provisions in regard  to fire are extended and improved and the recommendations of  the recent RoyalCommission have been embodied,   Hew provisions in regardto fire drill and fire alarms  are proposed.   In particular the present limitation of the  existing provisions to factories where 40 persons  aro employed is modified so asto apply the requirements to  (a) all factories where morethan 20 persons are employed,  or where explosives or highlyinflammable materials are stored or  used  (b) all new-factor ies where 10 or more  persons are employed on any floorabove the ground floor paid  (c) all existing factories wheremore than 10 persons are  employed above the first floor or                                                               Iat a greater height than 130 foet above the. ground level.Further, in addition to  the powers of local authorities to -make byolaws as to means  of escape a general power is givento the Home. Office to make  Regulations for all or any classof factories (Clauses 50  -  35),      A new general provision  (borrowed from the Coal mines act) giving the Inspector power to require any defect ordanger in a factory, that is not otherwise provided againstto be remedied is inserted.    (Clause 57);       Part III,  Welfare (General Provisions).      Experience gained  since  1916 In the application of welfare Orders to different industries makes it possiblenow to propose certain general provisions for all factories,-Hew clauses are accordingly inserted (Clauses 58-43) requiring!the provision of drinking water, washing facilities, firstaid and ambulance facilities for sitting, accommodation forI.
keeping and drying clothing, and the supply of protectiveclothing.      In addition there are two proposals, of a novel and in-port ant character.   The first, (Clause 44) is that every person employed in a faotory shall he given a holiday on fullpay of at least six consecutive days for every twelve monthscontinuous service with the same employer.   A movement inthis direction on a voluntary basis has made considerable progress in the country and there already exist a largenumber of collective agreements on the subject between employers and workpeople.   A list given in the ministry ofLabour Gazette, December, 1922, shows that apart fromsectional agreements general agreements had been made forthe Boot and Shoe, Railway Servioe, (Traffic Section),Printing, Bookbinding, Heavy Chemical Manufacture, paint,colour and varnish manufacture, oement manufacture, matchmanufacture, confectionery, and fruit preserving trades,flour milling, tramway,,undertakings, gas undertakings.      The clause will no doubt lead to considerable discussionif not controversy, on account of the additional charge to industry and because, for the first time in the history ofthe Factory Acts, a provision of this nature is extended toall workmen, and is not limited to women and young persons.      The Mother clause is Clause 45, which provides for aperiod of rest of not less than 24 hours for every personemployed between 6 p.m. on Saturday and 6 a*m.  on Monday,with power to the Home Office to exempt any Industry or classof work, after consultation with any organisation representa-tive of employers and workers in the industry affected,  onthe ground of the exigencies of the work. .  It  seems desirableto take the opportunity afforded by this Bill to  give effectso far as factory workers are conoerned to  the  Weekly RestConvention in industrial establishments,  which was adopted
by the International Labour Conference of 1931.   The week-endrest is in the case of factory industries univeroal (except insome special procossos which  would be entitled to exemption)and no serious difficulty is to be anticipated.             Part IV._Health, Safety and Welfare            (Special Provisions and Regulationsj.      The provisions as to removal of dust are made much stronger.   The Inspectors are not to be&quot; required to prove that the workers are being endangered by the inhalation ofdust.&apos;   The production of dust to a substantial extent isregarded as an evil from which the workers must be protected.(Clause 47).      A new Clause is introduced to prohibit spitting in  myroom where a notice to that effect is exhibited by the.occupier.   Spitting is already forbidden in public carriages,railway citations and other public buildings, and, in many areas, on the pavement of streets..  (Clause 40).     . Another new Clause  (Clause 52) deals with the carryingof heavy weights by women and young persons.      An important and controversial proposal is contained in clause 55, which prohibits night work in bread baking, subjectto any speoial exceptions which may be allowed.   This Clausecarries out the Report of the Departmental Committee of 1919,The then Government undertook that effect should be given tothis Report, and a&apos;Bill was introduced by the Home Secretary-(Mr. Shortt) in 1920.   The Bill, however, was strongly opposedand made no progress.   In view of the findings of the Com-mittee and experience of the, war, 1 have no doubt that, subjectto the exceptions provided, for, night work in this industry can safely be abolished, and my only doubt is whether, havingregard to tho controversial nature of the subject,  it shouldbe dealt with in the Factory Bill or left over pending its
                      -8-&apos;                 ;            683consideration by the International Labour Conference whichis to discuss the question of a night baking Convention at its meeting in June next.   I have been strongly pressed bythe Unions to deal with the matter immediately by legisla-tion and on the whole I am in favour of putting it in thepresent Bill.      This Part also contains special provisions as toshuttle kissing and artificial humidlfication, whichparticularly affect the cotton industry (Clauses 56 and 58).Tho practice of shuttle kissing is very objectionable, and both sides have agreed that, except for certain classes ofcloth, it is not necessary.   As regards artificial humidi-fication, which has been the subject of serious controversya Conference is now taking place at Manchester with represen-tatives of both sides, and I have reason to hope that&quot;anagreement will be arrived at.   Should an agreement not bereached I propose to proceed with the provisions in the bill which, by reducing the limits of temperature within whichartificial humidification may be introduced, will greatlyimprove the conditions.      Underground workrooms in factories are regulated in&apos;Clause&apos;59 which provides that in the industries to which.theclause is applied an underground room shall not be used ifit is certified by the Inspector to be unsuitable as regardsconstruction, light, ventilation or in any other respect.      It is proposed in Clauses 65 to 65 to generalise theprovisions in the White Phosphorus Matches Prohibition Act(l) ay providing that where the use of a particular material is prohibited by any Regulations,  the importation of articles in which that material is used and the sale of such articlesmay be prohibited, and (S) by giving power to the Inspectorsin all such cases to take samples of materials In use in thefactory.
     Part VI.  Employment (Women, Young Persons, and     g ^ ^                         Children).      The general change in working hours which has takenplace necessitates a fresh scheme for the regulation of hoursof employment.   It is proposed to adopt a working week of 48hours, hut to allow considerable elasticity in the arrangement of the hours.   The old system of a fixed period of employmentbeginning at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. is no longer possible.Work before breakfast has very largely disappeared, and it isnecessary to allow employers, with the shorter period ofemployment, much more freedom in fixing the time at which itis to begin.   The Bill proposes that the period of employment on any day, that is hours of work plus intervals, shall notexceed 11 and the hours of work exclusive of intervals shallnot exceed 9;  that the period of employment should be takenbetween the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. (on Saturdays 2 p.m.);and that the length of a spell should not exceed 4-g- hoursunless an interval is allowed in the middle of a spell, inwhich case it may be 5.   The Bill is in accordance with theWashington Convention.      A provision for overtime is retained, but the cases inwhich overtime is to be allowed are left to be dealt with byOrder.&apos;  Hot more overtime will be allowed than under theexisting lots.      A large number of obsolete provisions in regard tohours have been swept away, and the special exceptions whichit is necessary to retain have been revised and simplified.      Clause 92 relating to certificates of fitness of youngpersons for employment in factories will require to bere considered in the light of the recommendations of theDepartmental Committee now sitting under the Chairmanship ofMr. Rhys Davies.   I expect to receive the Report of thisCommittee in a day or two, when revised proposals will be circulated.
                                                              fr\  ^            Part VII.   Special  applications  and  extensions.            The most  important new  provisions here  are  the exten-      sione  of  the Act to.all classes  of  building operations, and      to engineering works.   These  provisions are based in the      main on the Buildings  and Engineering  Works Bill which was      introducer in  1909  by  the Home Office,            Power.is  also given to  the Secretary of State  (Clause      98)  to apply the Acts, with any  necessary  modifications, to      any  work  of constructing, reconstructing,  repairing, &amp;c. or      breaking  up of a ship, or in scaling or cleaning boilers or      bilges.   This provision  is particularly required  (l) for      the  protection of young lads employed  in cleaning  boilers      and  bilges, who  work often under wretched  conditions and (2)    .  for  dealing with lead-poisoning  in  breaking up of  ships.             Part IX.  Particulars  of work  and  wages.            &apos; Clause  104 extends the  requirement  of particulars of      work and  wages to all  workers  by the piece.    It is based on      the  provisions in the  numerous Orders  which have been made      by the Home Office  under  the Act of 1901 and which have      worked well.                      Part X.   Miscellaneous.            Clause  US will &quot;empower  the Secretary  of State to      make binding on  an  industry arrangements arrived at by a      Joint  Industrial Council  or other body representative of      employers and employed, or by  agreement&apos;between any organisa-      tion representing employers and  any organisation representing      workers for the  modification or  extension  of any of the pro-      visions of the Act.    Many of  the Joint Industrial Councils      are  understood to be in favour of such a provision.                      Part XIV. Supplementary.            The Act is made to apply  to  industrial undertakings      carried on by looal  authorities  as  well appeal to  industrial      undertakings carried on by the Crown.S.5.19^..
