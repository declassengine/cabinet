  (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Secret           .       IMPERIAL YJIRELESS SERVICES.CP. No.286 (24)--&apos;-1-1-                oc                 NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR          $ i:                                 ON THE         MEMORANDUM BY THE POSTMASTER GENERAL (CP. 280 (24)).1,    In March,1924, the Cabinet agreed (C.P.166/24)  that:-      &quot;The  Postmaster General should have authority  while      awaiting the views of the Dominions and India, to proceed      with  the preparation of his  plans on the assumption that      the report of the Wireless Committee  was approved, subject      to the  recommendations of the Postmaster General and of the      Imperial Communications Committee.&quot;2,    The Imperial Communications  Committee met on the Srd April,      1924, and then decided:-      &quot;To defer the discussion on  the question of the reservations      by the  Air Ministry on the Report of  the Wireless Telegraphy      Committee (I.C.C.754) until  the detailed proposals by the      General Post Office and comments thereon by the Air Ministry      had been received&quot;...3.    These detailed proposals have not yet been considered by&apos;or      even  formulated to the Imperial Communications Committee.      The consideration by that Committee of the Departmental      views in regard to the Wireless Telegraphy Committee&apos;s Report      is accordingly Incomplete, and the Air Ministry have had no      opportunity of obtaining consideration by the  Imperial      Commirni cat ions Committee of  the. very  grave objections which      would attach from the point  of view of Air defence to any      further developments of the  W/T stations at Leafield (or at      Northolt).4*    I would urge most strongly that no decision should be taken      by the  Cfebinet to approve extensions  at either of these      Stations until the question  has been adequately discussed      by the  Imperial communications Committee,  I am ready and      desirous that this discussion should  take place at the      earliest date convenient to  the other Departments concerned,5.              I would therefore  request that conclusion (l) of      the Cabinet Committee^ report as set out, in paragraph 9 of      CP,  280 (24) should be approved as if it read:-  &quot;The Rugby     &quot;Station to be completed as  arranged  (with 16  masts) and the     &quot;construction or enlargement  of some other high power stations     &quot;to be considered by the Imperial Communications Committee  ancl     &quot;he proceeded with immediately afterwards&quot;.T.Air Ministry.                       Secretary  of  State for Air.6th May, 1924*                          .
