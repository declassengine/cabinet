The amendment effected by this clause is due to thechange  hi the constitution of  the reserve force  of theIndian Army.                   Clauses 5 and 7.    The effect of  these clauses is that  the commander-in-chief of a composite force serving outside HisMajesty&apos;sDominions, consisting partly of the Army and partly  ofthe air force, whether  such commander-in-chief is  amilitary officer or an air  force officer,  can declare thewhole force to be a force on active service.

A colonel on thestaff is the equal in rank of a colonel commandant, andit is desired to confer on  the  colonel on the staff thesame  status as that at present enjoyed by a  colonelcommandant.                     Clause 8.    This amendment will  have the effect of renderingnaval or  air-force  decorations and rewards held by persons  convicted  by courts-martial under the Army Actliable  to forfeiture,  in  the  same  manner as militarydecorations and rewards are at present  liable.                     Clause 9.    The object of this clause is to provide that where  acomposite force, consisting  partly of the army and partly of the air force, are on active service, the commander-in-chief, whether a military officer or an air force officer, isto be able to  exercise  as  respects  the whole force thepowers under s. 47 of the Army Act of dealing summarilywith charges against officers and warrant  officers.    62-3                a
