JCRST.(Tb-ls Document Is the property of His Britannic    *&quot;     Ma j e sty&apos; s Government).CABINET.MEMORANDUM (NO. 1)&apos; BY THE MINISTER Or&apos; PENSIONS.          I submit for the information of the Cabinet,a brief statement of administrative reforms which I havebeen enabled to make since I took Office.          I have now been able to make a preliminarysurvey of the whole field of pensions administration, forwhich I am responsible, and the following changes havebeen made by me.     1.   The Benefit of the Doubt.          I have Issued a special instruction to all members.of my staff, including Medical Boards, directingthem to treat all claims with the utmost sympathy and consideration, and to bear in mind that, in accordancewith a principle of working agreed with the Treasury, incases where there is doubt, the benefit of that doubt Isto be given to the claimant unless the balance ofprobability, is clearly against the claim.     2.   Cases  of Lunacy not Attributable to War Service.          At my  instance, arrangements were made, withthe help  of the  Treasury, to remedy the grave hardshipwhich was caused in 1922 by the termination, under theprovisions of the Warrant, of the allowances and otherprivileges which had been granted to men discharged onaccount
account of mental affection from the Forces engaged in thelate war, whose disability had necessitated treatment in public lunatic asylums.   As a consequence, the cases Inquestion, numbering about 700, have been restored to their former position in so far as the State is again responsiblefor their maintenance as &quot;service patients&quot;.     3.   Awards &quot;for a year and until further instructions&quot;,          In order to reduce to a minimum the periodicalre-examination of disabled men, in cashes where pension hasbeen current for some years (as is now the case with thegreat majority of officers and men on the pension list) Ihave arranged that in all cases where pension has beencurrent for four years and upwards, and &quot;where a final awardcannot on medical advice be made, an award of conditionalpension shall be given &quot;for a year and until further instructions&quot;.   This will mean that men.will be leftalone to&apos;d.raw their pensions so long as their conditionremains uncertain, or unless they claim that they areworse.   Pensions are now being awarded under thisInstruction in over 3,000 cases a week,     4.   Final Awards &quot;set aside&quot; by the Appeal Tribunals.          I have endeavoured to meet the serious complaint that, in cases where the final award was &quot;set aside&quot; on appeals]Jby the Appeal Tribunal, the Ministry took no further actionin the case.   Where a case is set aside by a Tribunal,their finding means, of course, no mere than that the awardIs declared to have bean improperly made final.  I have nowarranged that in all cases set aside, the officer or manconcerned shall be immediately medically examined by aMinistry Medical Board, in order that, if his conditionjustifies it, a further award of pension may be made.                                  VJ.&quot;  :         -   w
     5.   Changes of Entitlement.  ,                  . . -u          Changes of entitlement, involving in manycases entire cancellation of. pension, and In other cases a change from a previous verdict that the disabilitywas either &quot;attributable to&quot; or &quot;aggravated by&quot; war service, have caused much dissatisfaction, especiallyin those cases where the Ministry&apos;s previous decisionon a case has remained unchanged for  some years.   some measure of review was necessary in the past because ofhasty work done at the time of demobilisation, but Iconsider that old cases must now be held to have been quite sufficiently reviewed and I have now. arranged,with the sanction of the Treasury that, as from the1st April, the systematic review of entitlement will cease in all cases of old standing.   No change ofentitlement will take place in future in any casemore than a year old, unless there has been actualerror of diagnosis, or obvious error of fact or fraud.This will apply to all officers&apos; and men&apos;s disability pensions, widows&apos; pensions and Dependants&apos; pensions,     6*   Final Awards - Correction of Errors,           i----------          A certain number of cases having come to light through medical treatment or otherwise, in whichit was manifest that serious error had occurred in themaking  of final awards (e,g. owing to error, orincompleteness of diagnosis, seriously affecting thefuture  extent of the man!s disablement)  I have now,with the consent of the Treasury, obtained sanction to remedy  these cases by cancellation of the final award and the substitution of an award more appropriate tothe man&apos;s condition.   I am considering whether an amendment of the Regulations Is desirable to enablethis to be carried out more effectively.U     7*
     V.   Dependants 1  Pens Ions.          I found, when I took office, that the reviewef pensions based on pre-war dependence (i.e. on the amountit was claimed that the deceased soldier had regularlycontributed to his parent or other dependant) was already three parts done.   From all the information I havereceived, It is clear  that a number of these pensions were awarded on inaccurate  information, and though, in viewof the length of time  for which many of these pensions hadbeen drawn, it would,  I think, have bean better had the reviewnot been instituted, I felt myself precluded (though with considerable reluctance) from advising that the review shouldaltogether cease, and  all previous pensions be restored,   I asatisfied, however, that Inadequate opportunity was given tothe pensioners concerned to state their case against the reductions proposed by the Ministry, and I, therefore,directed -     firstly, that in  no case should a pension be          reduced without the beneficiary being given at          least 14 days in which to state his or her          version of the facts,  which statement should be          fully considered before any reduction was made;  and     secondly, that every person whose pension had been          reduced in the past, should have the fullest          opportunity  of appealing against the reduction -          in the first instance  to the War Pensions          Committee, and in the  second instance to the          Ministry itself.   In the event of the appeal          being successful, the  amounts deducted are, of          course, reimbursed.          At the same  time, I have considered very carefully the whole scheme of Pensions to Parents, whichare at present awarded solely on the basis of need andincapacity for self-support, owing to infirmity or old age, and I am In communication with the Treasury as tocertain amendments of  the existing scheme, which are nowunder consideration.
     s*   Recoveries of past over-payments.          Much dissatisfaction has been caused by the recovery from subsequent issues of pension of over-payments made in the past in respect of treatment allowances by War Pensions Committees, or of pension by theMinistry Itself.   I have now obtained thesanction of the Treasury to waive all such recoverieswhere it is satisfactorily shewn that the recipientcould not reasonably be supposed to have been aware  ofthe over-issue, or where the circumstances of the casewere such that it is considered that recovery from the recipient of the over-issue would be inequitable.     9*   Liaison between War Pensions Committees          and&quot;the Ministry.          I have found that there is insufficientconnection between far Pensions Committees and theMinistry,   It is my intention to remedy this by providingfor an Improved system of representation for War PensionsCommittees on the Advisory Councils and of representation,in turn, of the Advisory Councils on the Central AdvisoryCommittee constituted by the War Pensions Act 1921,    Bythis means War Pensions Committees, who are in touch withthe individuals in  their localities and with thecircumstances of their areas, will have a directinfluence on the Advisory Councils and ultimatelyon&apos;the Ministry itself.    10,   I am submitting two further Memoranda tothe Cabinet on matters which require their consideration and decision,- with  a view possibly to amendment either ofthe Royal Warrants  or  the War Pensions Acts,   Thefirst  of these Memoranda (Memorandum No, 2) will                                            \I                                            i                                                    deal
deal with all the questions relating to pensionclaims of disabled,officers and men, and the second(Memorandum No, 3) to the benefits of widows andchildren, and to other miscellaneous matters uponwhich the Party expressed a decided opinion atthe recent election,                       (Signed)  FRED. 0.  ROBERTS.                                Minister of Pensions.MINIS TRY OF PENSIONS.1st April,  1924.
