                  Telegram from Viceroy, dated 21st March 1924.     Pri vate.  Secret.     ]. I need scarcely assure you that I  have given the most careful consideration to the proposals contained  in  your private and secret telegram of the 12th. March, No. 837.   I have not failed to note that the proposals  are  put  forward with the authority of the Cabinet, as  result of their investigation into the Indian problem. I  have approached the consideration of the  proposals  with every desire  to accept them if I found it possible, because I appreciate, with the  members of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the importance of attempting to remove  the causes of distrust, and of convincing those Indians who  entertain such views of the true  current of British opinion and of the  genuineness  of the  intentions of  the British Government and people.   With the members of His Majesty&apos;s Government, I have been impressed by the  large  number  of  members returned to  the Indian  Legislatures,  Central and Provincial, with the professed object of seeking an immediate constitutional advance of  a far-reaching character in India.  You  will  realise  that it was because these considerations, amongst ethers, were present to our minds  that my  Government, after most careful deliberations, unanimously made recommendations to  you regarding the question of constitutional advance which have only been accepted in part by His Majesty&apos;s  Government.  In view of the  importance of your latest proposals, I have availed myself of the discretion given to consult  my colleagues in my Council, who have given them most careful consideration.     2. As I and my colleagues understand the proposals contained in your telegram, the purpose of His Majesty&apos;s Government is to  institute an enquiry  to ascertain:      (I) What are the grounds for the distrust  of the sincerity of the British Govern-        ment and people  in  instituting  the  reforms in  India;  and for the belief        that the  reforms are designed to further the interests of Britain, in exploiting        the resources of India, by keeping the Indians in a  position  of subservience        and  denying  to  them,  at  home and abroad,  the elementary  rights  of         citizenship ?     (ii) What complaints are made in regard to the operation of  the reforms  as an        effective instrument for the purpose intended and announced by the British        Parliament ?     We note especially that the object His Majesty&apos;s Government have in  mind, andwhich they propose to make clear by their instructions  to  the  suggested  Committeeand  by the  proposed  announcement, is to endeavour to arrive at  a friendly under-standing with the Indian politicians.   This object is to be made clear, subject to animportant qualification ; to  use  the language you  have  employed in  para. 6 of  yourtelegram,  &quot;it cannot be made too clear that the purpose of the present proposal is notto  pave the way  for  immediate changes in  the  Constitution.&quot;   We attach greatimportance to this statement regarding the purpose, and  to the language  negativingany desire or intention to pave the way for immediate change in the  Constitution.     3. We draw special attention  to the language employed, for the reason that some doubt was expressed in my Council as  to the meaning His Majesty&apos;s government intended to convey, and particularly because of the language used in para. 2 of the telegram.   There  it  is stated that His  Majesty&apos;s   Government do not contemplaterecommending to Parliament any change in the provisions of the Act,  subject to thepossibility of the Government of India&apos;s desiring any  such  change  as a result of theenquiry about to be held by them.  Two of my colleagues are inclined  to the  viewthat this language  is meant to  convey the readiness of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto  go further than has yet been announced  by the Government of India  in theAssembly,, or by you in the House .of Lords.   If,  as a result of investigation, theGovernment of India recommend this course, the  words  can  be taken to mean thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government appear  to contemplate,  not only a possible change in the     7196    125  3.24    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                      Printed for the Cabinet.   : March 1924.SECRET.CP. 203 (21).    I circulate below the Viceroy&apos;s reply to the  telegram issued ou the 12th March(CP  164A (24)).    24th March  1924.                                          &apos;     OLIVIER.
 Rules as a result of our enquiry, but also in the provisions of the Act itself.   It is in regard to the possibility of the latter that some doubt has arisen, but, in view of the whole telegram, I cannot, myself, think that you had any such intention, and I believe as do my colleagues,  that in para. 2 you were merely summarising, without attempting to be precise, the announcement which  we had already made.  If, however, my view of your meaning is wrong, please explain further and we will immediately reconsider the proposals in the light of further explanations.     4. Second branch of your proposal referred to above seems to cover, at least in part, the field of the enquiry we  have  already announced,  with your  approval, our intention to hold forthwith.  We do not, therefore, fully understand nature of enquiry, you have in  mind  regarding the operation of  the reforms,  and would ask for further information.  For the present, 1 assume that this  enquiry would  also  be subject to the limitations mentioned in your telegram.  Therefore, general observations made by me in this telegram regarding your proposals will apply also to this second branch of your enquiry.     5. I will assume that proposals are for  the purpose only  of convincing Indians of British sincerity, and  by this means  to pave the way for more co-operation  and goodwill  of Indian  politicians.  Generally siseaking, they  will  either accept the proposals, even if silent on the point, as giving expectation of an advance in the near future  towards responsible  self-government  or, if. such  expectations  are  directly negatived  by terms of announcement, they will view proposals with suspicion  and;distrust  as  being&quot;&apos;dilatory tactics and  having no practical  purpose.  There is  real&quot;danger in the first alternative, because proposals will certainly encourage Indians to expect prompt advance, and,  if this does not  result, more  intense  bitterness will be aroused and  bad faith will be imputed.  But  if your announcement clearly negatives an expectation of prompt advance,  and  only reveals the intention of removing, as far as possible,  any excuse for misunderstanding  and distrust, and  of  giving Indian politicians of  varied  shades of opinion, including Swarajists, an opportunity to state causes of  complaint,  there is  serious danger,  if not certainty, that proposal will be rejected  by extreme  politicians, and that  they will refuse  to make any statementbefore the proposed Committee.     6. Both I and all my colleagues wish we could accept  the view that an enquiryof this chai-acter would help to diminish  causes of distrust, but with great regret weare compelled to express our deliberate  opinion  that  it will not have the result  HisMajesty&apos;s Government wish to achieve.  We are reluctantly driven  to the conclusionthat more harm than  good would result from this enquiry.     Statement of the causes of complaint would inevitably become a statement  of thegrievances against the British  administration of India for the last 10, 20 or 30 years.You attempted to enumerate some causes of distrust in your  speech in the House ofLords; Motilal Nehru added to  the list  in the subsequent  debate in the Assembly,and complained of your (omission)s.  It is obvious that  the recent controversies suchas Rowlatt Act, Punjab disturbances, the action of General  Dyer, the former  Turkishpolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, arrest of Gandhi, action taken by the government under Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, prosecutions for sedition, certification  of theSalt Tax, &amp;c, would be advanced.  Cotton  excise  duty, military expenditure, failure to provide a  seheme  of complete  Indianisation of the Army  and the Services,  wouldbe put  forward  among the   causes  of  distrust.   Please remember  that these statements would be placed before  the proposed Committee  by men who&apos; have beensteeped in these  beliefs,  and that their  utterances of facts would be coloured bystrong prejudice.   It would be beyond the power of a Committee of members of theBritish Parliament to  formulate  any report, or arrive at  any result,  upon such material, which would even partially eradicate these causes of complaint from  the minds of Indian politicians.  Whatever explanations  the Committee might  give, theIndian politicians would  be sure to reject them on  the ground  that the Committeewas stating the British view;  indeed the  Indian politicians would  not be slow topoint out that the  actions regarding which they complain, in many instances had hadthe approval of the British Parliament, and had been, in some cases, dictated by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.  We would  ask you also to  consider the effect of  the  extreme.speeches by Indians denouncing British administration upon the British mind.  ,&apos; &apos;    7. Quite  apart from the inadvisability of  reopening past controversies,  .&quot;therewould, be serious  objection to the  preferring of  charges  and  causes of complaint
when these could not be fully answered  before the Committee.   You  recognise this difficulty in para. 7 of your telegram wherein you enquire what arrangements shouldbe  made  for  watching  proceedings   on behalf of  Indian  Government  and  forcriticising, rebutting or  correcting questionable  representations.  It would  seem tome and my colleagues that to arrange  for representation would make it  appear thatGovernment of India was &apos;on trial. I cannot think that it  is the intention of HisMajesty&apos;s Government that there should be anything approaching an  indictment  ofBritish administration in India before  this Committee.    Yet the proceedings would inevitably take this colour, as is clear from the courseof the political agitation, and especially from  the election manifesto of the Swarajists,which you quote in your draft.  The  manifesto, of course, is only a repetition of theprevious  attacks  upon the Government, and notably by Gandhi and his lieutenants.It was worded to attract Gandhi&apos;s followers  who had hitherto boycotted the Legis-Legislatures.  When it was issued the Congress members were divided upon the policy of entering  Legislatures, and object was to try to reconcile  differences.   If  the Govern-ment of India were ever to take part in such enquiry it would be necessary for themto be fully armed with all the material  to  rebut misrepresentation with what  we areunfortunately too familiar, and which would cover the administration for a considerable period. -    8. I and the  members of my Council are unanimously  of opinion proposals asat present  understood should not be further  persisted in, notwithstanding  that eachof us would  eagerly welcome  any means of removing the feelings of  distrust;  ofcourse, if we have not fully understood you, different considerations may arise, and  Iwould then require to reconsider matter with  my Council.    9. You are aware that we have already expressed our unanimous opinion arrivedat after careful  deliberation on a course  we  advised for your approval.  My Govern-ment, with object of attempting to obtain  co-operation of moderates and independents,desired to unfold  their  methods for dealings with agitation for constitutional advance in the debate in the Assembly on Rangachariar&apos;s  resolution.   We had little  hope ofplacating  Swarajists.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government were not prepared  to accept our recommendations, and we recognised that they required more time to make themselvesacquainted with the situation.   In accordance with your decision  we  shall thereforenow proceed with enquiry we have already announced, and consider situation  againlater.    10. This telegram has been considered by my Council and expresses  the views ofmyself and all my colleagues.
