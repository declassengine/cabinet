It was  understood, however, that this  decision          was not intended to  debar Ministers  from writing          signed  letters to the Press to  clear up adminis-          trative points on which public misunderstanding          existed J&apos;     Sfe  have some recollection that this  decision was announced in the  House and I will let you know if we can find the reference in Hansard,     In all the circumstances possibly Mr, Clynes may think.it desirable to invite the Cabinet on Tuesday morning to approve the answer to the Question which might be on thefollowing lines          The reply to the first part of the  Question          is in the affirmative.          With regard to the second  part of the Question          the present Government &quot;have decided to follow          the procedure adopted in this matter by their          immediate predecessors and  to refrain from          writing signed articles  on current  topics  in          the Press during their tenure of office.

My aear Howorth,         The Lord Privy Seal has been considering the point    raised in the following Question for Tuesday nest, standing    in ths name of Mr. Ormsby-Gore:-             &quot;To ask the Prime Minister,  whether $iis              attention has been called to a recorded              decision of Mr. Eonar Law&apos;s Cabinet that              Ministers of the Crown while holding office              should refrain from writing articles for              publication in the press;  and whether he              will adopt this practice in the oase of              the present Government.&quot;         After having read the previous  Cabinet decision quoted    in your letter of to-day, whioh of course he had not previously    seen,  the Lord Privy Seal is inclined to the view that the    correct answer to Mr.  Ormsby-Gore1s  Question would be:-             &quot;The answer to both parts of the Question              is in the affirmative.&quot;    but as this is a matter which would  personally affect all    Members of the Government,  he thinks  that before an answer  is    given the matter should be brought to the attention  of the    Cabinet,  and for this  purpose ha desires  it to be placed upon                 v    the Agenda for next Tuesday.   In the  meanwhile,  so that    Ministers may have an opportunity of  considering the  Question    before it is raised in Cabinet,  he desires that  your  letter of    to-day and this letter should be circulated to Members of the    Cabinet,                               Yours sincerely,                        (Signed)   A.P.
