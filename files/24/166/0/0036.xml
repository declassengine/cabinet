CABINET.PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF &quot;THE  BRITISH  NORTH  AMERICA                             ACT,  1867.&quot;        MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    I CIRCULATE to  my colleagues a  Memorandum  on the  subject of  a proposed amendment of Section 91 of &quot; The British North America Act, 1867.&quot;    I propose to communicate with  the Canadian Government by despatch onthe lines indicated in the last paragraph of the Memorandum, unless objection is  taken by any of my colleagues.                                                                 J.  H. T.    Colonial Office, ith  April  1924.                               MEMORANDUM.    In 1920 the  Canadian Parliament passed an Address to the King requesting that Section 91 of &quot; The British North America Act, 1867,&quot; might  be  amended  bythe addition of the following sub-section:         &quot; Any enactment  of the Parliament of Canada otherwise within  the    legislative authority of  the Parliament shall operate and be deemed to have    operated extra-territorially according to its intention in the like manner and    to the same extent as if enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.&quot;    The primary object of this proposal was to remove any doubts as to the powerof Canada  to control the proceedings outside Canada of Canadian  aircraft and canadian airmen, especially in view of  the provisions of the Aerial NavigationConvention to which Canada was  a party, but the Canadian  Government felt that&quot;a general  rule is of such  great importance, and the occasion for its applicationemerges so frequently in  connection with legislative  acts which become necessaryin the development of the country,&quot; that  it was desirable to obtain,  &quot;for  the avoidance of doubt, a declaration by the Parliament of  the United  Kingdom ofDominion  extra-territorial  authority in respect  of  all matters constitutionallypertaining to the Dominion.&quot;    The Minute of Council  submitting  the proposal  in one passage  implied thatthe object was merely to  make it clear that, &quot; when the intention is manifest thatdomestic consequences are to follow upon extra-territorial acts or omissions,&quot; &quot;the domestic tribunals &quot; are empowered to give effect to such intention.   In anotherpassage it referred as &quot; a precedent for statutory acknowledgement of the operationof local laws beyond Colonial limits &quot; to Section 177 of the Army Act, which giveseffect  to Colonial legislation respecting Colonial  forces throughout His Majesty&apos;sDominions.                                                       I i    In any event, it was necessary to consider the actual formula proposed by theCanadian Government, and this appeared to give rise to considerable difficulty.    The then Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lord Milner) referred  the proposal      [11446]                                                       B
to the Law Officers of  the Grown (Sir G. Hewart and Sir B. Pollock), who advispflon the 13th July, 1920, as follows :-         &quot; We have taken the matter into our consideration, and, in obedience to     your Lordship&apos;s commands, have the honour to report          &quot; That Section 91 of &apos; The British North  America Act, 1867,&apos; gives the     Parliament  of  Canada  power  to  legislate for the  peace, order  and  good     government of  Canada,  and, amongst other  subjects within this power,     enumerates  the regulation of trade and commerce, navigation and Shipping!     patents and copyright and criminal law.   In Attorney-General for Canada v     Cain  (1906), A.C.,  p. 542, it  was held that  a Canadian enactment was not     necessarily ultra vires because it involved  extra-territorial  constraint, but no     doubt, as a general rule, Colonial legislation  is  ultra vires if it purports to     operate extra-territorially.   The reasons for this rule  are obvious.  If  it  were     acknowledged  as  a general principle that laws of the  Colonies might  have     extra-territorial operation, frequent conflicts between  the various Colonies     Would almost inevitably arise owing to overlapping and conflicting legislation.     (Conflict  between  Imperial and Colonial  legislation is prevented by &apos; The     Colonial  Laws Validity  Act,  1865&apos; (28 &amp; 29 Viet., o. 63), any Colonial  law     repugnant to  the  provisions  of any Imperial  Act extending to the Colony     being void to the extent of the repugnancy.) &apos;         &quot; It is difficult to say what would be held to be the effect of the proposed     amendment, having regard to  the words  &apos; otherwise within  the  legislative     authority of the Parliament.&apos;  It might be  held that it merely expresses the     existing law, as exemplified in Attorney-General for Canada v. Cain (ubi supra).     But if it were construed as giving the Canadian  Parliament power to legislate     extra-territorially generally with regard  to all the matters mentioned in the     section, provided only that  the  legislation could be said to  concern the peace,     order  and good government of Canada, it would reverse  the fundamental rule     that Colonial legislation must primd facie  relate exclusively to the Colony,     and might, we think, quite probably lead  to  conflict  with the other self-     governing Dominions, who would naturally expect to be placed on the same     footing in this respect as Canada.         &quot;In our opinion the  Government should refuse to assent to the proposed     amendment, and  should consent to  extra-territorial  power  being given to     Colonies  only  as  regards specified  subjects  where, for  special reasons, it is     considered desirable that they should have such  powers.&quot;     In the meantime (by telegraph  on the 6th May, 1920) Lord Milner had informed the Canadian Government:          &quot;  It is difficult to arrive at any very clear idea as to the precise scope of     the  amendment owing to  the general   terms in which it is couched.  In     particular, proposal that Canadian  legislation should have same effect as it     enacted by Parliament of United Kingdom  may raise  difficulty with other     Dominions  as  appearing to  place them  in  same  relation  to  Canadian     Parliament as to Parliament of United Kingdom.         &quot; The question is thus  one which will require very careful consideration,     and does not admit of immediate reply.  It would be of assistance if I could     be informed what  points proposed  amendment  is  intended to cover  beyond     the  extension  of  jurisdiction to aircraft registered in Canada or  personnel     licensed in Canada.   Legislation can be introduced  at once  for this latter     purpose if desired that it should be  done.&quot;     Doubts as to the advisability of  accepting the proposal were also expressed by certain  Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and particularly by  the Boardof Trade in connection with its bearing&quot; upon  merchant shipping.     The Canadian  Government, in a despatch of the 1st September, 1920,  replied to Lord Milner&apos;s telegram of the 5th  May by explaining      (a.)  That the requisite provision could not well be expressed except  in general           terms;     (b.) That the words  &quot;otherwise intra vires &quot;*  in the proposal excluded  the           possibility that  the  other Dominions Would be  placed  in  the same   * This expression &quot; otherwise intra vire-*&quot; was  that used in the proposal originally submitted by theCanadian Government.  The formula used in the Address  of the Canadian Parliament is &quot; otherwise witlithe legislative authority of the Parliament.&quot;
          relation  to the  Parliament of Canada as to the  Parliament of the          United Kingdom;  and    Cc.) That &quot;any such enactment  must have  Canadian locality with  respect          either to the persons affected or the subject-matter ; thus, for example,          Canadian shipping should be subject to local regulation not conflicting          with the provisions of the  Merchant Shipping  Acts;  it  should be          possible  to extend local criminal enactments against offences committed          abroad by Canadians, as in the case of Canadians  who commit bigamy          in foreign countries  and  return  to  Canada;  the  regulation of the          Customs and Air  Services also produces occasion for the  exercise  of          extra-territorial power; but it is  impossible to foresee  or  enumerate          all the conditions  under which the authority might with propriety be          usefully  exercised.&quot;    In the debates on the Address in the Canadian  Parliament it was explainedthat there was no  pretension that the Canadian law &quot; will  prevail in any other country,&quot; and that  the  effect would be that if &quot; we did enact legislation imposingcertain obligations  upon our  citizens  while they were outside this country, whenthose citizens returned we  would be  in a position to  enforce those laws  inCanada.&quot;    This reply was referred to the Law Officers with the debates in the canadian parliament and the correspondence with the  other Departments of  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, but they advised on  the 10th November, 1920, that the new  papersdid not afford reason for any modification of the views expressed in their previous report of the 13th July, 1920.    As the origin of the Canadian proposal  was the desire  to  control Canadianaircraft and airmen when outside  Canada, and as this aspect  of  the matter mightbe of some urgency, it was considered desirable to be clear on  the point whether ornot powers  for this limited  purpose already  existed. The Law Officers were accordingly asked     1. Whether the existing powers of the Canadian Parliament under Section 132          of the British North America Act, relating to the enforcement of the          Treaty obligations of Canada, would not suffice to enable the Canadian          Parliament to  deal  with offences  against the  Air Convention  by          Canadian airmen  even though the  offences were committed  outside          Canada; and    2. Whether,  apart  from  any question of  Treaty  obligation,  the necessary          powers for dealing with Canadian offenders relating  to aviation found          within the  Canadian jurisdiction, even if the  offences are committed          outside  Canada, could not be  secured by a Canadian law making it  an          offence  to  re-enter  Canada  having  committed  such  an  offence,  in          accordance  with  the  principle  of  the  judgment of  the Judicial          Committee  of the  Privy Council  in P.  &amp; 0. Navigation Company v.          Kingston, A.C. 1903, p. 471.    The Law Officers, on the 24th December, 1920, answered both questions in the affirmative.    On the  21st January, 1921, Lord Milner sent a  despatch to  the Governor-General, in which,  after  stating that, while the reply of the Canadian Governmentand the debates  in the  Canadian Parliament showed that the powers sought were of a much more limited character than had been originally supposed, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment still felt great  difficulty with regard to the  form of the proposedmeasure  and had some  doubt as to whether  an amendment  of the British north america  Act was really necessary for the purposes  in view,  he proceeded to givethe purport of the opinion of the Law Officers of the 24th December, 1920.    The Canadian  Government replied in a despatch of the 2nd March, 1921, thatthey did not share the view that in matters relating to the enforcement of the treaty obligations of Canada, the desired powers are  already conferred  by Section 132of the British North America  Act,  and they also regarded as undesirable andinadequate the expedient of  proceeding in accordance with - the principle of the judgment of the  Judicial Committee of the  Privy Council in P. &amp; O.  NavigationCompany v.  Kingston.  Further, they stated that, in the absence of any acceptablesuggestion for the  improvement of the form of enactment, they ,adhered to thatoriginally proposed.  This despatch  was referred to  the  Law Officers with an      [11446]                                                      B 2
enquiry whether they could either suggest another formula for submission to theCanadian Government or state, for  communication to the Canadian Governmentprecisely  what were the objections to the formula  originally proposed.  On the31st May, 1921, they replied that they could not  suggest any other formula whichwould at the same time satisfy the  desires of the  Canadian Government and be free from objection on constitutional grounds.  Their objections to the formula proposed were those already stated, namely, that, if  it were  construed as giving the canadian parliament the power of extra-territorial legislation generally with regard to all thematters mentioned in Section 91 of the British North America Act, provided onlvthat the legislation could be said to concern the peace, order and good  governmentof Canada, it  would reverse  the fundamental  rule that Colonial legislation mustprimd facie relate exclusively to the Colony, and might possibly, and even probably,lead to a serious conflict of laws as between the various self-governing Dominions&apos;if the other Dominions were placed on the same footing  in this respect as thatupon which Canada desired to be placed.  The Secretary of State for the Colonies(Mr. Churchill)  replied  that  it  seemed  undesirable to  object to the  formulaproposed on the first of these grounds, having  regard to the present status of theDominions, and asked  to be  advised  whether the proposed formula went beyondthe wishes and intentions of  the  Canadian  Government as  expressed  in theirdespatch of the 1st September, 1920.   The Law Officers advised on the 5th August,1921,  that the formula  did go beyond the expressed wishes and  intentions ofthe Canadian Government,  but thought  that  the  Address  of  the canadian parliament might be accepted with the substitution of the following for Clause 2of the proposed Act:         &quot;An  enactment of the Parliament of Canada  may operate  extra-terri-    torially,  provided  that, and in so far as, such extra-territorial operation is    ancillary to, and  necessary for, its enforcement as a law for the peace,  order    and good government of Canada.&quot;    This formula was suggested to  the Canadian  Government, but in a despatch ofthe 19th  December,  1922, they expressed the  view  that  it was unacceptable,principally because the  validity of the legislation  under a power so expressedmight be said  to depend upon whether the Judicial Tribunals would consider thelsgislation necessary.  They thought, however, that the formula would answer thepurpose if modified to read as follows :         &quot; An  enactment of the Parliament of Canada if expressed to operate extra-    territorially shall have, and be deemed to have had, that operation if. and in so    far as it is a law for or ancillary  to the peace, order and  good government of    Canada.&quot;    The Law Officers (Sir  D. Hogg  and SirT. Inskip) were asked to  advise whetherthe modifications suggested by the  Canadian Government were  such as to render the formula open to the objection that it  went beyond the expressed wishes and intentions of  the  Canadian  Government  and, if so, in  what respects.  On the11th April, 1923, they advised that  the modifications did not materially affect theformula proposed by their predecessors and might properly be accepted.    It was not, however, possible to take  immediate action on this opinion, since in another connection the Law Officers advised that, as the constitutional  positionof the Irish  Free State was that of the Dominion of Canada, if the proposed concession were made in the  case  of Canada, the Irish Free State would beentitled to claim that it  had the same power.   This view of the position appeared likely  to  cause difficulty  and in any case I to differ from that  which had beentaken in the negotiations leading up  to the Articles of Agreement for a treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, viz.,  that  the constitutional position of theIrish Free State was to be that of Canada at the  date when the Treaty was signed(6th December, 1921), and not that the constitutional relations between the UnitedKingdom and the Irish Free State were to be  affected legally and constitutionallyby every change taking place after that date in the constitutional  relations betweenthe United Kingdom and  Canada.   The question was  again  referred to the LawOfficers, who advised  on the 31st December, 1923, that,  although the question wasone of considerable difficulty, they thought that the true construction of Article ii of the Treaty  was that the constitutional relations  between the United Kingdomand the Irish Free State  were to  be those  actually existing between the UnitedKingdom and Canada at the date of the. signature of the Treaty, although in tact
ij a/there might well be development of constitutional practice and usage between theUnited Kingdom and the Irish Free State as between the United Kingdom and theother Dominions.    It  is  therefore  possible to take action as  regards  the Canadian  questionwithout having to consider any possible implications as regards the position of theIrish Free State, and to inform the Canadian Government  that, if the alteredwording suggested by them is embodied in an Address to His Majesty the King in substitution for that forwarded in 1920, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be readyto take steps to introduce a measure into Parliament amending the British north america Act in the manner agreed upon.  As, however, this involves a promise tointroduce legislation into Parliament, the matter requires a Cabinet decision before a despatch is sent to Canada.
