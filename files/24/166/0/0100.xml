[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                       Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1924.SECRET.CP. 299 (24).               MEMORANDUM  ON  INDIAN  FISCAL  POLICY.     I circulate, for the consideration of my colleagues, a note on Indian fiscal policyv-comprising  (a) a historical account.;  (b) a statement of policy.  The note has beenprepared  for  presentation  to  Parliament, if  desired.   Before  dealing with  thisquestion, I would draw my colleagues&apos; attention especially to  the statement of  policy(notably in para. 10), -and ask them-to accept it as representing their own position.     1.  The history of the &quot; Fiscal Autonomy Convention &quot; is fully set out in the note.Briefly, tho Convention recommended by the Joint Select Committee of Parliament onthe Government of India Bill, 191.9, was that &quot; the Secretary of State should, as far aspossible, avoid interference when the  Government of India  and  its Legislature arein agreement.&quot;  It  is clear that in this contest the Government of India and theIndian  Legislature  are to  be  regarded as  separate entities;  indeed,  the presenttransitional constitution,  of India inevitably  makes  them  so.   The  one is  stillsubordinate to Parliament;  the other has not  yet  acquired, either in law or in fact,the right to speak  with a determining- voice  for the  peoples of  India  at large.   but when these two entities, neither oE whichns by itself autonomous, arrive at agreementwith each other on matters of purely Indian interest, their joint conclusions are held to be entitled  to the same respect as  the  conclusions  of  a responsible  government when fortified by the assent of  the Legislature  on which it depends for its existence.If India were autonomous, the conclusions of  the Government of India would, ofcourse, be the conclusions of the Legislature, since, if they were not, the Legislaturewoidd dismiss the Government.   During the transitional stage,  however, the Govern-ment of India and  the  Legislature must necessarily represent  not one element the-elector but two.  The Government (over and above its function as the representativebranch of His Majesty&apos;s Government in India) retains the duty of supplying the elementpf expert administration.   The Legislature, on its  side, not yet fully  controllingadministration, supplies  the element  of  popular representation.   Each, therefore,contributes  it own quota to their joint discussions; and when  their discussions end in agreement  on matters of purely Indian interest, the condition on which autonomycan  properly be conceded may be held to be satisfied.     ft is important to remember that the Government of India  have a dual function.They  are not only, nor always, the subordinate  agents  of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin India ; they are  also the government of the country, with  special knowledge ofthe conditions and needs of the country.  There are clearly many occasions on whichthey are bound to represent the views of His Ma-jesty&apos;s  Government on large mattersof policy which  are  not;&quot; of purely Indian interest.&quot;   There are .other  occasions onwhich these considerations  do  not arise.  Then is  the time to  give the Governmentof  India  a free hand,  so  long as it  can  fortify  itself  with  the  agreement of itsLegislature.     1 would remind my colleagues that the  demands of even the Indian Moderatesinclude the grant pf full responsibility to the Legislature except in regard to Foreign,Political and  Army affairs, and simultaneously  the removal  of the control  of theSecretary of State-that  is to  say, of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government,  for  whom the,Secretary,qf State acts.   The Moderates appear to contemplate that the,Government0.1 India should be fully responsible to the  Legislature in all subjects except the threementioned, and that.even in those three they should be amenable&apos;to the advice  of the-Legislature, but not subject to  the control of the Secretary of State.  To  that  extentIndians look  upon  the Government of India as &quot;their&quot; Government.   They maycriticise or abuse it; but ii is a Government on  the spot, susceptible  to their influence and composed of men with whom they work and live.   Much as they may resent itsshortcomings, they  resent far  more what  they regard  as interference with  &quot; their &quot;Government by  men acting some 6,000 miles away on an unintelligible but doubtless-convenient  theory  of  responsibility to  a  Parliament  which often shows   itself-remarkably ill-informed  as to affairs  in  India.  That is their  view  of the case.7333    125 5.24
          There is another  side to the,question which I need  not develop.  But  if, as I assume          my colleagues will agree,  control by Parliament through its  agents is still in many          respects essential, it is even more essential  that that control  should  not  go beyond          the necessities of the case.  If, however, we are to seek for  a  sphere in which the          Secretary of State might with advantage resume his  control,  it  appears desirable at          all events to avoid  the  one  and  only  sphere, outside  the  provisions  of the          Act of  1919 and the statutory rules,  in  which a definite  pledge has  been given          that  the  Secretary  of   State save  in specific  circumstances will  not  interfere;          that  is  to  say, in  Indian  fiscal policy.  The  pledge was  given  under  Mr.&apos;          Lloyd George&apos;s  Government  and was  honoured by  the  Conservative Government.         . Both  Governments were fully  aware that it  might lead to the  creation of a protective          system for India  against the rest of the world, including  the British Empire.  I cannot          trace, nor did I  expect to find, any evidence of  an attempt to  impose or suggest a          policy of protection  from here.   It would have  been  manifestly against the  local          interests of any  British Government to infuse such  an idea into the mind of the          Indian Government or the Indian politician.   The fact is that our predecessors found          that the  idea was there already.   The most they attempted was to say and this for          the most part in private communications-that if it had to be assumed  that India was          to. become a protectionist country  it was to be hoped that some  occasion  might be          found, at the discretion of the Government of India, to introduce Imperial preference.          The Viceroy&apos;s reply has hitherto been that the occasion might  come, but was not yet;          and that has hitherto  been accepted  as the last  word  on  the subject.   I cannot,.          therefore, see how our predecessors  could be regarded as not having been disinterested          in this  particular matter.  They  acquiesced&apos;^ in  a process  which they  saw would         . probably lead to a system of protective  duties against the world, and they refrained          from  pressing for the introduction of Imperial  preference, which would have offered          the only advantage they could gain  from such a system.              The accompanying note  quotes, in para. 8, from a speech made by Mr. Montagu          to a  deputation  in March 1921.  I should like to quote in  this  memorandum the          passage which immediately follows  that  extract: &quot; I really am astonished  to hear, if          they will forgive  me saying  so, the arguments of the representatives of Labour.   The          Labour  Party, it is quite true, gave  valuable support to the passage of the Bill with          all it  contained, but  they  always protested that  they took it because  they  could not          get anything better that they wanted more liberty for India, that the time had  come          to concede to  her  if not complete self-government  something very  near it.  Now          when, despite the limitations  of the Bill, you concede to her the right to mould her          own fiscal destinies, a section  of the Labour Party feels that those rights and liberties          which she has achieved are  even too large for the well-being of the  interests that they          are here to represent  to-day,&quot;              I sincerely hope nothing may be done which could turn this sally into an effective          taunt.              II.   As regards the expediency of publishing  the note or any similar statement          which my colleagues  may approve, I am inclined to suggest that there is  no need to          present  papers to Parliament until desire for them appears.   The  publication of the         . Indian Tariff Board Report has so far aroused little controversy in this country.   NoConclusion  dovibt that may  not hold  true for  long;  but if we are. to defend  the line of  action2 (a),      endorsed by the Cabinet on the 29th April approving the telegram sent  to India on          the subject,  we  should, I think,  find ourselves in a  better position if we refrained          from  publishing  what might be interpreted as an apology at a time when criticism is          slack.  My observation goes  to show that  the  implications of  the Fiscal Autonomy          Convention are already fairly well realised in  those  quarters of Parliament (as, for          instance, the Industrial  Group) which might  have  been expected to protest  most          forcibly against them.  If we are to be more seriously challenged  in Parliament, we          can then present the  note, or  so much of it as my colleagues may approve, not  as an          attempt to justify  something revolutionary, but as a statement of policy which has-          been, and should continue to be, accepted as a matter of  course.13th May, 1924.OLIVIER.
Note on the History of (1)  Indian Import Tariff Policy up to and after the institution             of the Reforms and (2) of the Fiscal Autonomy Convention.     1. Customs duties on.articles imported by sea into India have been  known forcenturies, though  until recent years the  rates were always low.   In 18c32 nearly allimport  duties  were abolished.   In  1894 customs duties  were  reimposed.   Dutieswere again  levied  at a  general  rate  of 5  per cent., with  railway  materials  and machinery left  free, and only 1 per cent, on iron and steel, but the Secretary of Statedeclined to  allow any duty  to be placed on the chief article of import, viz., cotton goods.  In December 1894 an import duty of 5 per cent, (for revenue) was placed on cotton piece-goods and yarn, accompanied by an excise duty of 5  per cent, on Indianyam of  counts  above 20s.   In 1896 the duty on  cotton piece-goods was lowered to.&apos;Si- per cenf., an excise duty at the same  rate was  placed  on all  Indian mill-wovencloth, and cotton yarn was admitted free of duty.     2.  The customs tariff of 1894 remained in its main essentials unaltered until thewar.  In general it consisted of a  low uniform rate of duty imposed on nearly allimports,  its object was  purely revenue, but where the levying of even the low rateof 5 per cent, was thought likely to impede  the development of the country, as in thecase of railway  materials, machinery and iron and steel, special exemptions were made.     3. In 1910 the  financial burden of the war necessitated  an  increase of customsduties.  The general rate  was  raised  from  5 to 1\ per cent.   Exemptions werecurtailed.   Machinery, other than that for cotton mills, and railway material weretaxed at &apos;2\ per cent., and the duty on iron and steel was raised from 1  to 2\ per cent.Sugar was subjected to a duty of  10 per cent., and considerable increases were madein the duties on liquors aud tobacco.  The cotton duty and  excise still  remained at-il per  cent.   In the following year, largely as a result of  the contribution of  100million  made by India towards the prosecution of the war, still further revenue had tobe found.  The cotton duty was therefore raised  to the general level of    per cent.,the  excise remaining unchanged at  &apos;3h per  cent.  This  change  met  with  greatopposition  in  Lancashire,  but was  defended  by the  Secretary  of State for  India(Mr. A.  Chamberlain) on the ground that it was demanded by public opinion in Indiaand that without it the promise of an Indian contribution of  100 million towards thewar would not  have been obtainable.     4.  In 1921 the Government was faced with an unprecedented deficit, and further large changes were  made in the tariff, which were designed to produce an additional revenue of 8 crores of rupees.   The general rate of duty, including the duty on cotton piece-goods,  was raised  from     per cent, to 11  per cent.,  the excise remaining, as before, at 33f per cent.   The special  exemption, however, which in view of the excisethe  cotton mills had enjoyed  in respect of imports of machinery and  stores  was withdrawn.   The  duties on  liquors and tobacco were enhanced once more, the dutyon sugar was raised from 10 to 15 per cent., and a high specific  duty was placed onmatches.  Finally certain articles in the nature of luxuries, such as motor cars,  silkpiece-goods aud watches, were singled  out for taxation  at the rate of 20 per cent.     5.  In  1922 it was found essential  to  make  for revenue purposes  further  far-reaching changes in the tariff.  The general rate of duty  was raised from 11 to 15per cent., but the di%ty on cotton piece-goods remained  at 11 per cent., the  excise  alsoremaining unchanged at 3$  per cent.   The duty on machinery was retained at 2\ percent., but the  duty on iron and  steel and  railway materials  was raised from 2\ to10  per cent.  The duty on matches was doubled, and that on  sugar raised from 15 to25 per cent.  Cotton yarn, which had since  1896 been free, was taxed at 5 per cent.The  duty  on  kerosene  was  raised by one  anna per gallon, and an excise dutyof  one  anna per  gallon was  placed on kerosene  produced   in India.   The  duty outhose articles which had been singled out for the special rate ,of 20 per cent, in 1921was now raised to 30 per cent.  Such increases as it was believed that liquors  could still hear without failing to  produce increased revenue were imposed, but the taxation on  tobacco was considered already to have reached the  productive limit.     6.  During all these changes the main consideration present  to Government  wasto obtain increased revenue, and the duties continued  to  be  commonly spoken of as&quot; revenue duties.&quot;   It is, however, &quot;obvious,&quot; as the  Fiscal Commission of 192.1-22said  that &quot;considerations other than those of revenue cannot fail to obtrude themselvesin the framing of  a tariff  containing  such high  duties and  such  a great variety ofrales.&quot;   In  this  connection it may  be recalled that Mr. Montagu, in  addressing  a
deputation from Lancashire in 1921 regarding the recent increase in the cotton dutiessaid : &quot;I do not want to deny let me say that in order to save argument because itwould be useless for  me  to deny that these duties  are protective.   A child wouldknow that.&quot;    7. Another point of importance in Mr. Montagu&apos;s reply to the deputation of 1921is that he made a statement to the effect that  the British Government  could not vetothe proposed increase nf the cotton import duties, however much they might wish todo  so.  This statement  was  based on the  following passage (quoted  in full byMr. Montagu from the Report of  the Joint Committee of 1919 on the Government ofIndia Bill): &quot; The Committee have given most  careful consideration to the relations of the Secretary of  State  with the  Government of India, and through it  with theprovincial Governments.   In the relations of the secretary of  State with the Governor-General in Council, the Committee are  not of opinion that any statutory change  canbe made so long as the Governor-General remains responsible to Parliament; but, inpractice, the  conventions which now govern these relations may wisely be modified tomeet fresh circumstances  caused by the creation of a Legislative Assembly with alarge elected majority.  In the exercise of his responsibility  to Parliament, which liecannot delegate to anyone else, the Secretary of State may reasonably consider that only in exceptional circumstances should he be called upon tq. intervene in mattersof purely Indian interest where the  Government and the Legislature of  India are inagreement.   This examination of  the  general proposition  leads inevitably to  theconsideration  of  one special case of non-intervention.  Nothing  is  more  likely to endanger  the good  relations  between   Iadia and  Great Britain  than a belief  that india&apos;s fiscal  policy is  dictated from AVhitehall in the  interests of  the trade of GreatBritain.  That such  a belief exists at the moment there can be no doubt.   That there ought  to  be  no  room for  it in the future is equally clear.   India&apos;s  position in theImperial Conference opened  the  door  to negotiations between India  and the rest ofthe Empire, but negotiation without power to legislate is likely to remain ineffective.A satisfactory solution of the qirestion can only be guaranteed by the grant of liberty to the Government of India to devise those tariff arrangements which seem best fitted to India&apos;s needs as an integral portion of the British  Empire.  It cannot be guaranteed by Statute without limiting the ultimate power of Parliament  to control the admini-stration of India, and without  limiting  the power of veto which rests  in the Crown ;and neither of these limitations finds  a place in any of  the Statutes in  the BritishEmpire.  It  can only  therefore be assured by an  acknowledgment of a convention.Whatever be  the right fiscal policy for India, for the needs of her  consumers as wellas for her manufacturers, it is quite clear that she should have the  same liberty toconsider her  interests  as  Great Britain, Australia,  New Zealand, Canada  and SouthAfrica.  In the opinion of the Committee, therefore, the Secretary of State should, asfar as possible, avoid interference on this  subject when the Government of  India  andits Legislature are in agreement,  and they think that ,his  intervention, when it  doestake place, should be  limited to  safeguarding the international obligations of  theEmpire or any  fiscal arrangements within  the  Empire to  which  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment is a party,&quot;    8. &quot;These,&quot; said  Mr. Montagu, &quot;are very strong words  which, except for sometimely warning  by my honourable friend the Member  for  Oldham,  almost passedunchallenged in  the  House of Commons ;  but when the Bill came for third reading tothe House of  Lords, Lord Curzon,  speaking on behalf  of His Majesty&apos;s Government,pointed out the great change which had  been instituted in these matters by whatamounted to the grant of fiscal autonomy to India.  I. will read you his words if  you.like, but I am sure they must be familiar to most of you, and  I do  not want to wasteyour time.   I can paraphrase them in the words of one of the speakers this afternoon.Tire people of India are plain humble people attd they regard  a promise as a promise;and after that report by an authoritative Committee of both Houses and Lord Gurzonspromise in the House of Lords, it was absolutely impossible for me to interfere  withthe right which I believe,was wisely given and which I am determined to maintain to give to the Government of  India the  right to consider the  interests of  India first,just as we, without any complaint from any other  parts of the Empire, and the otherparts  of the  Empire without any complaint from us, have always chosen the tariffarrangements which they think best fitted for their needs,  thinking of their  owncitizens first.  Nothing could be worse for what I have set my heart upon-India as awilling contented partner  in  the British Empire than  to promise her  through the mouth of. Parliament  these  rights  and  liberties,  and  then,  when  they are  only
accidentally applied, because of the sudden need for revenue which was never foreseenbefore the fall  in the exchange took place, suddenly to  say : &quot; We made a mistake in giving you this right; we are now going to do the very thing that we said we wouldnot do interfere with your fiscal arrangements for the  benefit of British trade.&quot;     9. Mr. Montagu further declared, in a despatch to the Government of India,dated30th June 1921, which  was subsequently published in India, that, in replying to the manchester deputation  he had accepted on  behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government theprinciple  recommended by  the Joint Select Committee with  regard to  the fiscalfreedom of India.     10. The present Government, like their predecessors, concur with Mr. Montagu in holding that the time  has passed when in relation to matters of  tariff  policy HisMajesty&apos;s  Government can  regard themselves as being at liberty to interfere afteragreement between the Government of India and their Legislature has been establishedexcept on grounds such as are specified in the Joint Committee&apos;s recommendations.     11. The Secretary of State  has accordingly given  the Government  of India  an assurance that he hopes that,  like his two predecessors in office, he will always be ableto say that nothing can  be found either in his views or in the attitude he has adoptedin regard to Indian fiscal policy which can impair the growth towards full maturity  ofthe convention favoured by the Joint Committee of 1919.     12. He has, however, thought  it  desirable to  point out  to the  Government  ofIndia that  this does not mean that they should discontinue the established  practice  of consulting him on important  questions of tariff policy before  formulating their viewsupon them.     13. He also regards the convention,  in so far as it has been in fact established,  asnecessarily subject to the following qualification.  By rule under section 19A of theGovernment of India Act, the powers of  superintendence, direction and control vested in the Secretary of  State and in the Secretary of State  in Council may in relation  totransferred subjects be  exercised among other things      (1) to safeguard Imperial interests, and     (2) to determine the position of the Government of India in respect of questions           arising  between India and other parts of the British Empire.     It is the view  of  the  Secretary of State and of the  Government that thisprovision represents a fundamental principle which applies to all cases of  devolution of control  by the Secretary of State ;  and although no similar provision was includedin the recommendations of  the  Joint Committee  of 1919 about fiscal  policy, theyhold  that this  omission cannot in practice limit the responsibility of the Secretaryof State for doing what is necessary to safeguard  Imperial interests or to determine the position of the  Government of India in respect of questions arising between india and other parts of the British Empire.     14. The main development in the matter of Indian fiscal policy, since the passingof the Government  of India  Act, 1919, begins  with the appointment in  1921 by theGovernment of India (on the recommendation of a Committee of the Legislative Council)of a Commission &quot; to examine, with reference to all the interests concerned, the tariff policy of the Government of India, including the question of the desirability of adopting a principle of Imperial Preference, and to make recommendations.&quot;     15, The Commission recommended &quot; the adoption of a policy of  protection to beapplied with discrimination along the lines indicated in their Report.&quot;  They furtherrecommended the constitution of a Tariff Board to advise the Government of India  in working out the details of the protective  policy.  It  was laid clown by the Commission,for the guidance of the Tariff Board in dealing with the claims of particular industries to protection, that the three main conditions to be satisfied were (a) that  the industrypossesses natural advantages, (b) that without the help of protection it is not likely  todevelop at all or not so rapidly as is desirable, and (c) that it  will eventually be ableto face world competition without protection.     16. As a  qualification of these  general  conditions it was  recommended thatindustries essential for purposes of national defence should, if necessary, be adequatelyprotected provided conditions in India were  not unfavourable for their development.     17. Further,  the general principles  were laid clown that raw materials andindustrial  machinery should ordinarily be admitted free of duty, and  that partlymanufactured goods used in Indian industries should be taxed as little as possible.   .
    18. On the question of Imperial Preference, which was specifically mentioned intheir terms of  reference, the  conclusions of the Commission were  that any generalsystem of.  preference to British  products  would  involve a  serious burden  which itwould  not  be  reasonable for India to shoulder,  while,  on the  other  hand, thepossibilities oi  advantage to India from  preferences granted to her exports were limited.  At the  same  time, India might  be in a position hi certain cases to grautpreferences which would  be of assistance to British industries and would not causeappreciable economic loss to India.  The advantages  on broad Imperial grounds of recognising the  principle of  Imperial  Preference  were pointed  put, and it  wassuggested  that the question of granting preferences  on a limited number of com-modities should fee referred to the Indian  Legislature after preliminary examinationof the several cases by  the Tariff Board.  The Commission recommended that  if thispolicy were adopted its  application should be governed by the following principles :     (a) That no  preference be granted on any article without the approval  of  the         Legislature!    -(b) That no  preference  should  in  any way diminish the protection required by         Indian industries.    (c) That preference should not involve any appreciable  economic loss  to India         after taking into account the economic gain  which India derives from  the         preference granted her by &quot;the United Kingdom.    19. The above proposals  relate entirely to  preference  to the  United Kingdom,and the Commission recommended  that any preferences which it might be  found possible  to grant  to (the United  Kingdom should be granted as a free gift..   In thecase of other parts of the Empire a  different  policy  was  recommended.  It  wassuggested  that the principle of reciprocity should  be followed, i.e., that preference should lie granted only,as a result of,.agreements mutually advantageous.    20. In the matter of excise duties the views of the Indian Fiscal Commission  areof considerable interest.   They refer to the  possibility  of cases arising in which  theimport  duty found to  be necessary for protective  purposes may  be less than  theimport duty required for revenue purposes.  In such a case  they advise that  tax may,if certain specific conditions are fulfilled, take the form of a protective.duty, plus anexcise duty, plus :an additional import duty.  The additional  import duty (they say);should. fully countervail the excise duty  and may be pitched  at a higher rate.    21. As regards the cotton excise, the conclusion of the Committee was  that  theexisting duty should, in  view of  its past history and associations, be unreservedlycondemned, that the British Government should announce  its&apos; intention of  allowing the Government of India  ,to decide, in  agreement with  the Indian Legislature, what action  should be taken,  and that the Government of India and the Legislature  should then begin with  a  dean slate and take  such measures  as the interests of Indiarequire.    .22. In February  1923 a Resolution   was  adopted by the  Indian LegislativeAssembly  with  the lull  concurrence  of the ^Government  of India, supporting  therecommendations  of the Fiscal Commission  in favour of  the adoption qf  a protectivepolicy.   The -Resolution  did  not deal,with the  questions .of Imperial  preference orof excise.     23.  The Tariff Board recommended by  the  Fiscal Commission was appointed in the summer of .1923 with instructions to deal  first with  the question of  grantingprotection to the  steel industry.   The  Board has  recently  issued its  report on thisquestion,, which recommends a substantial increase in  ,the duties ,on many  kinds of iron and steel and the  grant  of bounties  on the manufacture of rails and railway wagons.
