THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY13                   GOVERNMENT.          INDUSTRIAL  COURTS  AMENDMENT  BILL, 1924,          ................................&quot;          ...      ti                MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP                       LABOUR,EGRET.P.239.(24).        1,    In view of the statements made in the House of        Commons by the Lord Privy Seal I think that the Cabinet        should come to a decision at their meeting on Monday,        April 7th.,  regarding the attitude to be adopted by the        Government representatives in the House of Lords on the        second reading next Tuesday of Lord Askwith&apos;s Industrial        Courts Amendment Bill,  a copy of which was circulated on        the 28th March with CP. 222(24).   I understand that        the Lord Chancellor agrees that a decision on this point        is  desirable,        2.    Lord Askwith1s Bill proposes to make strikes and        lockouts illegal under penalty of a fine in those cases        where the Minister has  referred a trade dispute to a        Court of Inquiry under Part II of the Industrial Courts        Act.             The Bill  is based  on the Canadian Industrial Disputes        Investigation  Act,  1907, but whereas that Act applies only        to  disputes in certain industries,  namely, Mining,        Transportation and Public Utility Services,  there is        no  such limitation in the present Bill.             The Bill  does  not  prohibit strikes and lock-outs but        aims at delaying extreme action ponding an impartial        inquiry,   It   applies  only to those disputes in which a        Court of Inquiry has actually been appointed..                                                         /The
ihe Canadian Industrialpisputes Investigationlot,  1907,     The underlying idea of the Bill is that when theMinister of Labour has decided that, in the publicinterest, a Court of Enquiry should be set up, it isdesirable (again in the public Interest) that time should be available, prior to a stoppage of work,for the Court to hold Its Enquiry and to present itsReport.3.   Anti-strike legislation exists in various countries, but a survey of their working tends toshow that in none of the countries are large scalestrikes unknown.   The efficiency of such legislationappears to hinge largely on two vital factors whichare to some extent inter-dependent     1,  the support given by public opinion to the          enforcement of the penalties contained in the          Act and,     2.  the strength - political and economic - of the          organisations concerned.4.   The Canadian Act was the subject of specialresearch by the TJ,S, National Industrial ConferenceBoard and their report (1918) summarises the workingof the Act as follows :-       &quot;The commonly expressed opinion, that the&quot;failure to impose penalties for illegal strikes&quot;is the principal weakness of the Act and the&quot;cause of Its comparatively infrequent application,&quot;is not borne out.   The position taken by the&quot;Department of Labour in regard to initiating&quot;prosecutions for Infractions of the Act, in which&quot;they leave this to be done by prosecution of the&quot;aggrieved party, appears to be the only&quot;practicable attitude, and has probably saveelv&quot;the Act from early repeal.   The penalty always&quot;exists as a possibility, and the entire attitude&quot;of organised labour indicates that it feele the&quot;restraint which the Aot exercises.   This                                        /restraint
9 eJ H&quot;restraint, however, arises  quite as much from the&quot;mere fact of declaring the strike illegal under&quot;the Act as from the penalty provision.  The Act&quot;might he quite as strong if the penalty provision&quot;were repealed.   The few cases in which penalties&quot;have been imposed are responsible for much&quot;opposition to the Act     &quot;The existence of the Act on the statute books&quot;has acted as a wholesome restraint both on employers&quot;and employees through a period of great industrial&quot;unrest;   it has served in some degree to crystallise&quot;public opinion and in particular cases to make it&quot;effective for maintenance of industrial peace,     &quot;Investigations have been most successful&quot;when most informally conducted;  introduction of&quot;legal.machinery is almost certain to destroy their&quot;usefulness.     &quot;Where investigations&apos; have&quot; been fairly&quot;conducted, with no unfortunate administrative&quot;.&quot;irritations, and with tactful, Informal procedure,&quot;resultant recommendations have been almost&quot;universally backed by public opinion and accepted&quot;by the disputants,     &quot;The Act after ten years of operation has the&quot;support of Canadian public opinion.  The evidence&quot;of this is twofold:  (a) No political party has ever&quot;suggested making an issue of its repeal (b) The&quot;restraint which organised labour feels in spite of&quot;the fact that the penalty has seldom been imposed,&quot;is that of public opinion behind the Act&quot;.

It is apparent that such success as has  attended  the  CanadianI  Aot is due to the use of its conciliatory provisions and   toI  the influence of public opinion and not to  the  existence of the  penalI  clauses of the Act,      The suggestion has been put forward from time  to  time by  means  of questions in the House that legislation  on the lines of the  Canadian Act would be beneficial in this country,,      It is clear, however, that any attempt to  restriot the freedom1 of Employers to lock-out their workpeople and that  of  the  workpeopleSI to withdraw their services would meet with  strenuous opposition.  The:1I strike is a weapon which tho Trado Unions will  net  willinglyI surrender.Pi      The fact that under Lord Aekwithfs Bill, if it became law,  aII strike or look-out in oontravention of the  Act  would becomeII punishable by a fine would not aot as a deterrent.  It isI Practically impossible to devise legislation  which  would prevent  menI from striking if they are determined to do  so-,  and, when large  bodies of men were involved, any attempt to impose  penalties   would  probably be impossible with the very serious  result that the law  would be brought into contempt.                                                          /The
6.   The existenoe of such legislation as is proposed wouldmake the administration of both Part I and Part II of theIndustrial Courts Act more difficult.   At present theMinister 6f Labour oan endeavour to secure a settlement of a dispute by ooneiliation or arbitration with the consent ofthe parties and, having no power to interfere with thefreedom of either side to oause a stoppage of work, hisimpartial position is unauestioned.   If, however, theMinister had the power at any moment by tho appointment ofa Court of Inquiry, to deprive either party of the bargainingvaluo of a stoppage of work hie position as an impartialauthority and his ability to seoure a voluntary agreement might bo prejudioed.7.   At present tho Minister of Labour is able to exercise his authority to appoint a Court of Inquiry in the publicinterest with the knowledgo that, by such action, he does notweaken the pooltion of either party exoept in so far as aninformed public opinion ie oreated.   If, however, theappointment of a Court of Inquiry imposod penal obligationson the parties and oould bo held by one or tho other as adefinitely hostilo aot, tho Minister and the Governmentwould be plaoed in a very difficult position.8.   In oertain oases in Canada, otrikes have taken plaoewithout warning In follow of the existence of the power ofthe Govornment to require postponement.   Such a tendencywould be deetruotive of collective bargaining arrangements and, again, would expose tho impotence of tho Govornmentwhen large numbers of men wore involved,9.   Lord Askwith&apos;s Bill makos no provision for cases inwhich a stoppage has actually occurred before a Court of inquiry has been set up.   The reoent Docks Strike provides
                                                    x        s). 1?l ^an example.    In  that  oaBe tho strike was due to commence at12 noon and  did in faot commence at that hour.   Neverthelessnegotiations,  whioh for the .past few days had been continuous,proceeded up to and beyond that hour.   It may be argued that,if powers such as those Lord Askwithls Bill seeks to obtainhad existed, the  Court would have been appointed at an earlier stage.   It  must  be borne In mind, however, that the negotiations at no stage  appeared to be hopeless and the precise stage atwhich it becomes  nocessary to appoint a Court must depend upontho particular circumstances and the Minister must retaincomplete freedom  to decldo the question.   It is unlikely that,even if powers were provided, the appointment of a Court of inquiry after this or any other important strike or look-outhad commenced, whatever the penalties, would cause either side to end or suspond the stoppage of work,10.  It is reasonably clear that the &quot;peaceful picketing&apos;andpersuasion&quot;  allowed by Section 2 of the Trade Disputes Act,1906, would not bo lawful in the oaoe of any look-out or Btrikeforbidden by the Bill but It Is suggested that Section 4 wouldnot be affeoted although  any person who oontravened the provisionsof the Bill would not osoape his liability for penaltiestheroundor upon the ground of his being a Trado Union official.11.  I would suggest to,my colleagues  that the principles ofthe Bill  should not be adopted but that, in  the debate in theHouse  of  Lords, tho Government representative should adopt anon-committal  attitude on the ground  that, before settling theirpolicy it is necossary for the Government to consult with employers&apos;  and workers&apos;  organisations.
