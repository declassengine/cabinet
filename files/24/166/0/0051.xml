Sir,                I am directed by&quot;the lords Commissioners      of H.M.  Treasury to acquaint ycu, for the information      of the  Secretary of State,  that H..M. Government have      had under  eareful consideration the question of insuring      that the Cabinet - and Cabinet Committees - shall be      invited  to  reach decisions only after the subject      referred to the Cabinet has  teen theroughly examined      between  each of the various  Public Departments concerned.                This elementary  rule of business is essential      if the  Cahinet and its Committees are to  have available      all the  facts and points of-view requisite for an      enlightened decision  and  are  to be saved the possibility      of hasty &apos;ir uninformed conclusions,,                The observance of  the rule is the more      obligatory  under modern conditions when the mass of      Government  business has so  enormously increased and as a      consequence Governments can  only get through it      efficiently if the issues  presented for decisisn have      been carefully investigated  beforehand by the Departments      in collaboration.                The Cabinet  feels  sure that Departments are :      anxious  to  assist it in securing the observance of this      rale, and has come to  the  conclusion that the desired      object will be facilitated  by  the fallowing procedure.      In future all memoranda,  draft Bills and  other  constituents      of the Agenda will be  sent  to  tho Cabinet Secretariat for                                                 /circulatione Permanent Under-Secretary of State.
 ciccu&amp;t tan only after their subject-matter has been fully examined between the Departments from which they emanate, the Treasury, the Law Officers where oontentious Bills are involved,  and any other Department concerned, and these documents  will bear on the face of them a specific statement that this examination has taken place. Tho documents should be made as complete as possible by containing the various arguments and critioisms which might be brought against the proposals advocated.   To enable the members  of the Cabinet (and Cabinet Committees) to have time to  consider proposals intended for Cabinet decision and in view also of  the possibility that such inter-departmental examination may result in definite differences of opinion necessitating the preparation of memoranda by the dissentingDepartment or Departments, no memoranda, draft Bills,etc. which originate proposals  for Cabinet decision will be placed on theAgenda until an interval of one we&apos;ek has elapsed after circula-tion, except on any  occasion when the Prime Minister expresslyauthorises  a relaxation of the rule.

At their Meeting on April 7th, 1924 (Cabinet 25( 4) 6)the Cabinet had under discussion the  question of thoadequacy of the Cabinet procedure for ensuring thatGovernment measures were discussed  In a sufficientlycritical spirit before introduction in Parliament,  and agreed          That the Secretary should arrange to meet          the law Officers and the  Chiof Parliamentary          Draughtsman,  and 3hould ask thorn to suggest          some improvement in the present procedure,          with a viow to having all Government Bills          examined from a critical  point of view,          preferably by a lawyer who  was also a          politician, before introduction in Parliament.                               m2.   In accordance with tho abovo decision the question was fully examined at a Meeting on  April 9th, 1924,attended by the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General,the Lord Advocate,  tho First Parliamentary Counsel  (sir frederick 1. Lid dell, X.CB.)  and myself, in the courseof which the Attorney-General  requested that the attentionof the Cabinet, should be specially  directed to the  ternsof a Memorandum, dated April 8th, 1924, which had beenprepared by him, a copy of whioh is annexed hereto.3,   In the following paragraphs I  venture to submit  forthe consideration of the Cabinet certain conclusions  and suggestions on the subject of the improvement of the
existing-machinery (including suggestions  for meetingthe specific points raised at the conclusion of  the attorney-General&apos;8 Memorandum) but in so doing I wishit to be clearly understood that, while I  have reasonto believe that the law Officers are in general  agree-fflent with the proposals, they take the view that thesettlement of Cabinet procedure is essentially a matter for the Cabinet itself and is not one on whioh it wouldbe proper for them to express an opinion. 1STIEG BIKK&apos;1HDOEHIRBj4,   The following is a brief summary of the presentCabinet procedure regarding Government legislative proposals.   normally the procedure in the case ofimportant or contentious questions differs from thatfollowed in the case of uncontentious proposals andthose of secondary importance.iPOBTAIT5.   As a rule questions in the first category come beforeBEiMiODS   the Gabinet in the first instance in the form of Memoranda1ST JOJJS  .           inviting the Cabinet to decide generally on the policy           to be adopted with a view to the subsequent preparation           of the draft legislation.    formally the Cabinet then           either -                (1)  refer the examination of the whole question                     to an ad hoc Committee which reports in due                     course to the Cabinet.  The latter then authorise                     the preparation of the requisite legislation                   .  and direct its submission to the Home Affairs                     Committee (or occasionally to the ad hoc                     Committee) the recommendations of which have                     subsequently to be adopted by the Cabinet                     before the legislation can be actually                     introduced.   (The recent Unemployment Insurance                     Bills followed this procedure)or(2)   authorise the preparation of the requisite     legislation on lines approved by the Cabinet     and direct its submission to the Homo Affairs     Committee.   That Committee examines the draft     legislation,  reports to the Cabinet, with which     rests the final decision as to the  Billss     introduction  in Parliament.

Proposals of this kind are circulated to the cabinet in the form of draft Bills covered by Memorandaand are considered in the,,^i-rstiinstgnog by the HomeAffairs Committee whioh reports to the Cabinet after examining the. proposals.  The ultimate decision as tothe introduction of the Bills rests with the Cabinet,JIBCULATION)? CABINET4P3R8 TOQJISTSBS.7.   In aeoordanos with the rules  of procedure laiddown for the Secretary (Cabinet  7  (24)  Conclusion 1  (a)),oopies of Cabinet Conclusions relating  to legislation in contemplation and of draft Bills and Memorandahave been circulated to the Ministers specially concerned,including Ministers who are not  Cabinet Ministers,  iorexample, some ninety Cabinet Conclusions have been Keritto the Attorney-General whose as  a Member of the HomeAffairs Committee, has, of course, received copies ofall Government Bills and relevant Memoranda.8*   The Cabinet will observe that in his memorandum the Attorney-General states that he is unable to suggest any remedy for the present difficulty unless -         &quot;(l)  One of the Law Officers is allowed to          be in a position of knowing tho policy of          the Cabinet before it is finally determined,          so that lie may have an opportunity of express-          iatg a view as to whether that policy can be          legally carried into effect and,          (2)  Any Bill of importance is submitted to          the Law Officers for approval before it is          printed,  so that they may have an opportunity          of seeing that such policy is legally effected.     I desire in addition to draw the attention of the     Cabinet to the following considerations which     I think materially affect the problem:-.
(l)  Ministers are often given wholly inadequate     opportunities of examining proposals before     the latter are placed on the Agenda for the     Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee.  It is by     no means unusual for Departments to send     very important papers for consideration by     the Cabinet on the day before the Meeting at     which the papers are to be discussed.  In     such oases it is obviously impossible for a     Minister concerned to obtain &quot;tha considered     views of his Department on the proposals,     much less  to submit his own written observa-     tions on tho subject to his  colleagues.(2)  In the past it was a common  practice for     the Minister concerned to include in his     Memorandum a full statement  of the  Parlia-     mentary and other objections to his pro-     posals and his suggestions for meeting     hostile or unfavourable comment.   Experience     has often demonstrated  tho value  of this     practice,  not only in stimulating helpful     criticism among Ministers themselves,  but     also (on the principle  that  forewarned  is     forearmed)  in providing valuable  arguments     in advance of the Parliamentary discussion.     Similarly it has been customary for Ministers     affected by the proposals of a colleague to     circulate  the oomment of their Departments     even if only of minor importance.(3)  It will be  remembered that in reconstituting     the Home Affairs Committee by Cabinet  8  (24)&apos;  8     the Cabinet decided   that -         &quot;The function of the Home Affairs  Committee          should  be,  as&apos; in tha past, to  relieve the          Cabinet  of  the  detailed consideration of          the large  volume of legislative and admin-          istrative  work referred  to the  Cabinet,          while  leaving  to the Cabinet the ultimate          decision  on those  questions.&quot;9.   Doubts have arisen whether these terms of referenceare intended to restrict the Committee to the consideration-tion of matters such as the form or relative urgency  of proposals submitted to it or whether the intention wasto authorise the Committee, in addition, to examine andreport to the Cabinet on questions of policy,  or  at leaston the feasibility and expediency of translating  intolegislation the policy proposed,  having regard both to existing legislation and to political considerations.
SESSIONS.    10.   After  careful  review I  submit  the  following           suggestions for  the consideration of  the  Cabinet:-                (l)  That a Minister proposing to  submit to  the                    Cabinet an important  question of policy-                    involving legislation should arrange for                    the Law Officers to be given as early notice                    as possible  of-the nature of the contemplated                    proposals.                (2)  That,  in  future, when an  important question                    of policy involving legislation is placed                    on the Agenda  of the  Cabinet, the Secretary                    to the Cabinet should  obtain the Prime                    Minister&apos;s  instructions as  to the issue to                    the Attorney-General  (or  in his absence                    to the Solicitor-General) of a special                    invitation to  attend  the  Meeting of the                    Cabinet for  the  discussion  of the item in                    question.                (3)  That should  it be found impossible to secure                    the attendance of either  Law Officer at the                    Meeting in question the Cabinet decision should                    be so  drafted  as to afford  an opportunity to                    the Law Officers to express their views on                    the matter before further action is taken.                (i)  That in forwarding-copies of Cabinet Conclusions                    and other Cabinet documents to the Law Officers-                    arrangements should be made by the Secretary                    to the Cabin&apos;et to ensure  that so far as possi-                    ble their particular  attention is directed to                    those  which relate to  legislative questions                    involving important or highly contentious                    questions of policy.                (5)  That th e  Parliamentary Counsel should be at                    liberty to advise the Minister concerned to                    draw the  attention of the Law Officers to                    important  or highly contentious questions of                    policy involved  in contemplated legislation.                (6)&quot;  That save with the express  sanction of the                    Prime Minister,  which will  only be given in                    very exceptional circumstances,  a question                    shall  only be  placed  on the Cabinet Agenda                    provided  the Minister initiating a subject                    has circulated his Memorandum at least 7                    days prior to  the Meeting of the Cabinet.                (7)  That Memoranda submitted to the Cabinet or                    to a&apos;Cabinet Committee should indicate as                    fully as  possible the Parliamentary and other                    objections, if any,  to the particular  proposals                    and also  the manner in which it  is suggested                    that Parliamentary criticism or  obstruction
H   H     oa&apos;j be,st be ^viated or met and that Ministers     whose departments are affected in a secondary    - -degree by the proposals should consider-the     advisability of&apos; circulating comments on the     proposals,  evaja if such comments are only of     minor importance.(8)   That the Cabinet should consider the desirability     of authorising the Home Affairs Committee to     examine proposals brought before tho OeEimittss     from the point of view of the feasibility and     expediency  of translating policy into legis-     lation and- to report their recommendations to     the  Cabinet,  with which the final decision     will,  in any- svent,  rest*(9;   That immediate steps should be taken by the     Ministers concerned  to submit to the Lavy     Officers for an, expression of their views,  any     Bills of first importance involving questions     of policy which have already been apprsfed     by the Cabinet but have not as yet been&apos;     introduced  ,  and that this procedure should     be adopted  in the  oase of the Hours of Indus-     trial  Empleymont Bill which is at the mociesrt     awaiting Cabinet approval.Whitehall Gardens, S  lOtb^april, 1924.W.1,,

CAFI-OT......PPOCnpURIi\     Memorandum from the Attorney-General to the Cabinet.                              emnha t i c     I  desire  to express my most/ protect  against the treatmentat present  afforded to the Lav? Officers with regard to Rillsintroduced  into Parliament.     In Important matters it generally happens, that the LawOfficers  have  no knowledge whatever of the policy to be adopted.by the  Cabinet, and in consequence are quite unable to express an opinion  as  to whether that policy can legally be carried into  effect.    In addition, they often see  no draft of the pro-posed Bills before printing,  and consequently are unable togive  an opinion ae to whether the  policy (even if they knew it)is properly effected.   For example, in the case of the rent restrictions Bill, I was not informed of  the policy to be embodied  in the proposed amendment,  not did I see the amendmentwhen  drafted,  until the course of  the debate.    I then formedan immediate view that it was both ineffective and meaningless.I may say that I die?, receive an intimation of the Cabinetspolicy  in the  above matter, but it was the  day after the division  took  place.     On the same night I was asked to oppose an amendment tothe War Charges Bill, which sought to delete a portion of that bill, which portion was to my mind inadvisable in policy, andlegally indefensible.     Quite.apart from the inevitable result upon the Governmentof such a policy,  it is scarcely feir upon  the Law Officers ,whoare universally,  and not unnaturally blamed for the ineptitudeof the  Bills introduced.                                &apos;     *     I  am utterly unable to suggest  any remedy for this stateof affairs  unless:-&apos;         &quot;(1) One of the Law Officers ia  allowed to be in aoosition  of knowing the policy of  the Cabinet  before it isfinally determined, so that he may have an opportunity of expressing  a view as to whether that, policy can be legallycarried, into effect and,           (2) Any Bill of importance is  submitted to the LawOfficers  for approval before it is printed, so that they mayhave  an opportunity of seeing that such policy is legally effect     The  Solicitor-General entirely concurs  in this Memorandum.
