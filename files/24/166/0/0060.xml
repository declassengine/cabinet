[This Document is the  Property of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1924.SECRET.CP. 260 (24).                                  CABINET.EGYPT.            CONCLUSIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.    IN connection with  the memorandum dated the 9th  April,  1924, on  Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations, circulated by ths Foreign Office, I am directed by the PrimeMinister to circulate, for  the information of the Cabinet, the following conclusions reached  by  the  Committee  of Imperial Defence at  a  meeting  held  on  the4th February,  192? :-    The Committee reached the following conclusions :     (1.)  To recommend that  on military  grounds it was undesirable that  Sollum          should be alienated from  Egyptian sovereignty.    (2.)  To recommend the immediate withdrawal from Egypt of one brigade of          Royal Field Artillery.*    (3.)  To invite the Foreign Office to take note that, on  the assumption that the          broad lines of military and air policy  stated in previous Memoranda of          the Secretaries of State for War and Air (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 457-B and          462-B and Cabinet Paper CP. 2622/21) are adhered to, the War Office          view is that the maximum  further reduction  that  might  be effected,          and then  only in the event  of a satisfactory solution of the reserved          subjects, is one battalion  of infantry.    (4.)  To draw the attention of  the Prime Minister,  as Secretary of  State for          Foreign Affairs, to the view of the Committee that, from a military point,          of view, in order to secure the safety of our vital  communications through          the Suez Canal, the beset  solution would be if the Egyptian Government          could be induced to allow British troops to remain in Cairo and existing          air stations at Heliopolis and  Helouan.  If this solution should prove          impossible to obtain,  the next best plan from a military point of view          would be to negotiate for the retention of such positions as would enable          a British garrison of moderate size, including air stations at Fleliopolis          and Helouan,  to provide for the defence of Egypt from the north-east          without being exposed to  the danger of attack&apos; from the reverse side.  The          Air Force establishment at Aboukir should also be retained together with          existing air stations on the Canal.    (5.)  That the Foreign Office should be asked to keep the Committee of Imperial          Defence in touch with the situation, and, in the event of any developments           which might affect our military requirements, to consult the  Committee.    * This recommendation was approved by the Cabinet at their meeting held on February 4, 1924 (Cabinet 9 (24),Conclusion 18), with the proviso that the Secretary of State for War should not announce or take action with&apos; egard to this withdrawal until authorised lo do so by the Prime  Minister, as  Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.                                                       M. P. A. HANKEY.       April 16, 1924. .[11493]
