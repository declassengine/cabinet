                                                   APPENDIX &apos;B&apos;.DRAFT OP REPLY PROPOSED TO BE SENT ON BEHALF  OP HIS  MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE REPRODUCED  IN APPENDIX *At.     His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under  consideration therequest of the Director of the International  Labour  Office tobe  furnished with replies to the questions  set out in the  report prepared by the Office on the &quot;Development  of facilities for the utilisation of Workers&apos; Leisure&quot;, which  subject is included inthe Agenda of the Sixth Session of the International LabourConference in June next.     2. While appreciating the care with which the report  inquestion has been prepared, H.M.Government  view with apprehensionthe suggestion that the discussion may involve reference to questions so far-reaching, as transport and  housing facilities,a break in the working-day and the drink traffic.  As the  Directorwill appreciate, these questions have to be considered by governments not merely from the standpoint  of the  utilisation ofworkers&apos; leisure but from the wider standpoint of  the publiohealth and general welfare and needs of  the community. In the-opinionof H.M.Government, any Recommendation  resulting from thediscussion at a single Conference of the question  of the utilisation of leisure in the wide aspect outlined in the  report and questionnaire must necessarily be of so vague  and general a character as to be of little practical utility.  Detailed  replies to  the questionnaire have accordingly not been prepared.     3. It will be within the recollection  of the  Director thatat  the 21st Session of the Governing Body of  the InternationalLabour Office, the suggestion was made *y the parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Labour and  supported  by otherMembers that discussion at the Conference should b$  confined toa specially selected aspect of the utilisation of  leisure.  H.M.                                                   /Government
1 fi             Government hope  that it may be possible  to  adopt  this             suggestion and they are inclined to  think  that,  although             some aspects  of  it might  prove highly controversial,             a diBoussion  on  the development  of the intellectual             life of adult workers,  accompaniod by statements of the             methods followed in general  and  scientific or technical             education for adult workers  in  different oountriee, would             bo of considerable  interest  and profit./Not          4.   Pour memoranda,  accompanied by illustrative docu- attachejl/.             ments, dealing with technical education of adults and             non-vocational education in England and Wales and in             Scotland respectively are accordingly enclosed for the             information of other Members of the Organisation.
