He  told methat in his view the Governing Commission of the Saarhad made great progress during the few weeks which haveSpain and Herr Kossmann of the Saar Valley, were elected by the Council.     In particular Major Stephens drew my attention to five specific measures agreed to by the GoverningCommission last month:-        1,   Owing to the improvement in the financial   position of the Saar the increase in the local gendarmerie   has been doubled by the Governing Commission, and the   number of gendarmerie will thus be raised during thecurrent year from 355 to 755.  This is in accordance withthe resolution which I proposed at the last meetingof the Council.     2.   On April 23rd the Governing Commission cancelledthe Ordinance concerning peaceful picketting to whichobjection had been taken by the population, and haveagreed to establish a law concerning strikes which willbe practically ldentioal with the English law on thesubject,     3,   Tho Governing Commission have agreed to adhere to the Washington Hours Convention, and their adhesionIs now being put through in Geneva.  This will mean thelegal establishment of the eight hour day in the Saarelapsed since the new members, the Marquis Espinosa of
Valley, a step to which, Major Stephens attached ;;reat importance      4C She Governing Commission lias allowed thoAdvisory Council (Lon&amp;esrat) of the territory to appoint itsown President to replace Kossmann who has &quot;become a memberof the Governing Commission.  Shis has caused considerablesatisfaction.      5. The Governing Commission have decided to establish a labour bureau for the territory.  This has been done atthe desire of the Miners&apos; Trade Unions of the territory,,         Major. Stephens wont on to tell me that in thefirst place ho thought both the Marquis Sspinosa andKerr Kossmann would be excellent members of the Commission,;and that in the second place he thought the most rapidpossible progress was being made in the establishment of thelocal gendarmerie,    In his view it would not &quot;be possible atthe present moment-to dispense altogether with tho Frenchgarrison force in the territory,,  He had done, and was doing,everything in his power to establish good relations with theinhabitants and ho believed that they appreciated hisefforts0 &apos; On the other hand, he had no illusions as to theattitude of the political leaders towards the Commission, andhe was genuinely afraid that if all the trench troops were withdrawn it might  not be possible for the Governing Commissionto carry out their duties under the Treaty of effectivelysafeguarding the French interests in the mines aid else wherein the territory,,  On the assumption that there must, at least for the present and until the general attitude of thepolitical leaders and of the population became much more friendly, be a.French garrison of some sort, he believed thatthe present force was almost as s: iall as it could be.
