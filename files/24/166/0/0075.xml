B I g E T                BSPR3SBNIATI0N OF TEE, PBQPLE ACT. 1913                     AMENDMENT (Ho. 2) BILL 1924.                     (Presented by Mr. Kendall).                 (MEMORANDUM  BY THE HOME SECRETARY).              This  Bill  would extend proportional representation        (applicable  at present to elections for the- five university        constituencies returning two or more members) to the        election of members of the House of Commons generally.              Further at any  election of a single member,  (i.e.        bye elections and elections for existing constituencies  not        regarded as suitable  for proportional representation)  each        elector  would have one transferable vote,  the election thus        being  held  under the  system usually known as the alternative        vote,                     &quot;              For proportional representation purposes all  existing        constituencies except those considered unsuitable &quot;on        account  of  sparsity of population or otherwise&quot;  are to be        combined to form constituencies, returning from 3 to ?        members, by Commissioners appointed after the passing  of        the Bill.    The  scheme prepared becomes operative on        adoption by both Houses of Parliament with any modifications        or  additions agreed by Parliament.              Regulations will be made by Order in Council        prescribing the  method of voting and of transferring and        counting votes at elections.              The expenses of a candidate become  reduced to a  sum        equal  to that obtained toy dividing the  present maximum (5d        for eaoh elector in a borough and 7d in a county constituencies-         uency)  by  the number of members to be  elected.              The new methods of election come  into operation at the        next  General Election.ft P..3 A
                Discussions in Parliament..      On the occasion of previous discussions in parliament on proportional representation, the Government of the day have left the matter to a free vote.      The Speakers Conference, from which the Representa-tion of the People Aot, 1918, resulted, proposed propor-tional representations for the large parliamentary boroughsreturning 3 or more, members, and also recommended thealternative vote for single member elections contestedby more than two candidates.      The Bill for the Act of 1918 made provision accordingly.      The Commons rejected proportional representation butretained the alternative vote.   The Lords restoredproportional representation and deleted the alternativevote.   As a compromise the. alternative vote was dropped,proportional representation was applied- to the universitieswith two or more members &quot;and provision was made forCommissioners totprepare a scheme under whioh if approvedby both  Houses, 100 members for boroughs and countieswould be elected by proportional representation.   A schemeprepared after the passing of the Act was rejected by the commons.      A Bill in the same terms as the. present one (exceptthat it did novt include any proposal for the alternativevote at elections of single members) was discussed onFriday, 8th April 1921 and was rejected, by 186 votes to87.   It was stated that the then Government were divided in opinion on the subject and could not promise to give facilities to the Bill or to introduce one of theirown.      An alternative vote Bill was discussed in the Houseof Lords on 20th March 1985.   The Government attitude wasthat a measure restricted to a particular form.of thealternative vote could not be supported but that any measure of general electoral reform put forward by the
opposition would be considered.   The Bill was then withdrawn.     Preparation of Scheme of combined constituencies. ^ p. ^      The proposal of the Bill that Commissioners Bhallprepare a scheme combining constituencies for election ofmembers under proportional representation is an adaptation of section 20(3) of the Act of 1918 under.which 100 atewfea&amp;were to be elected for combined constituencies if the schemeof the Commissioners were adopted by Parliament with any modifications or additions agreed by both Houses.      In preparing their scheme in 1918 the Commissionersfelt that it was inadvisable to combine constituencies indifferent parliamentary boroughs or counties, and their scheme made combinations only of constituencies in.the samecounty or borough.   In preparing a complete scheme of constituencies for proportional representation it would beimpossible to avoid combining borough constituencies  withcounty constituencies.   In such cases various questions will arise in relation to the,, combined constituency, suchas candidates&apos; expenses, the Office of Returning Officer,which must be considered.      Rules to be approved by Parliament  should be laiddown for the guidance of the Commissioners in preparing thescheme.           Position if scheme rejected by Parliament.      It is possible having regard to the difficultiesattending combinations of constituencies  that the schemeprepared by the Commissioners for proportional representationmight be rejected by Parliament.      In that event the position under the Bill would bethat elections will continue to be held for the constit1- uenoies as formed by the Act of 1918.    But the provision inthe Bill that each elector shall have one transferable vote and that elections of two or more members shall be heldaccording to proportional representation  will remain a sub-substantive enactment.      Therefore at any election of a single member contestedby three or more candidates, the alternative vote will arcoly
   and any election of both members for a constituency return in   two members will be held under proportional representation.         Twelve constituencies (all boroughs) in England and   Scotland return two members each, as is the case with two   county constituencies; in northern Ireland.                      northern Ireland.         It may be noted that northern Ireland is not excluded   from the operation of the Bill, but that it contains no   provision for the combination of constituencies for   purposes of proportional representation.         The effect therefore seems to be that the system of   proportional representation will apply to the elections of   two members in the constituencies at present returning two   members and that the alternative vote will apply to all   elections of single members contested Toy three or more   candidates.         The Bill is down for second reading on Friday Snd   May.   6 members (S Conservatives,  2 Lib orals  and ?j   Labour members - Mr. Herbert Morrison and Mr. Haylor)   have put down a motion that the bill be read a second time   this day six months; .  and Mr.   Franklin has put down a   motion &quot;That the whole question of electoral reform be   referred to a, Committee similar in constitution to the   Speaker&apos;o Committee of 1918, when all systems of reform   can be examined and an agreed measure submitted to the   House.&quot;         In my opinion it is essential for the Government to   take a more definite attitude  than it has done hitherto   &quot;on the question of Electoral Reform.   Over 80 members of   the Labour Party committed themselves definitely in favour   of proportional Representation at the General Election and   the Annual Conference  has also expressed itself in the same   direction.-                                   A.-H.39th April, 1934.                                                      9Q.105-S
