Conclusions of meeting held in the Ministers&apos;          Conferenoe Boom at the House of Commons at 4 p.mi          on Monday, 24th Marohj 1924.          1.   The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum          (B.C. (24) 3) by the Chief Civil Commissioner (see          Appendix).P0STS3.   2.   The Committee approved the modified poster  (B)          reoommended,  subject to the omission after &quot;No Black-          legging Involved&quot; of &quot;Standard  Rates of Pay will be          given,  and&quot;.   It was agreed that the poster should not          bear the words &quot;O.E.M.8.&quot;  or any other  heading,  but  that          space should  be provided at the foot for the signature          of the Chairman of the Volunteer Service Committee.SBCHECY.   z.   The Committee discussed at some length the  question          of the extent to whioh the details of the emergency          organisation  should be made public.   It was generally          agreed  that there was no need in present circumstances          for elaborate secrecy,  but the  view  was expressed that          the opportunity should  be  taken,  when any announcement          was made,  to  deal with  certain  wider aspects  of  the          problem of industrial unrest.   It was agreed  to refer          for the decision of the; Cabinet  the  quefetion:-               (a)   Whether any announcement should  be  made at                    a suitable *pportunity, and if  so               (b)   What-the scope of such announcement should be.LOCAL     4.   - It was agreed  that  it was  not desirable  to lay downAUTHORITIES          any hard  and^fast rule  as  to  the  persons  to be appointed          as &apos;S^^^Smm^^^^mm^xt that  it should be  left to the          Chief Civil Commissioner&apos;-,  as before, to  fill vaoancies          as they arise by the selection  of the person who  is*          oonsiderod  to be from every point of  view tha most          suitable.     2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.

SjjG a E T.A P P E I Dili                 -MBHDI&amp;lIPtM BY SHE CHIEF civil COMMISSIONER 20 THE      EMBRGEICY COMMITTEE OE THE CABHTET. POSTER.        The draft recruiting poster supplied for emergencies          under previous Governments should, I think, he revised so          as to suit the Views of a Labour administration,   I attach          a copy of the original poster (A) and one of the  mod^LXud          poster that I recommend (B).  The principal. ehangK iu the          declaration against &quot;black-legging&quot; and the atatemnv. bhnfc          only-essential aervioes will be&apos; performed by those recruited          under State help.,            ...  I should also call attention to the words &quot;Prices kept          down&quot;, which may be difficult to carry out in actual practice,          and to the words &quot;Standard rates of pay will be given&quot;, which          are perhaps difficult to define in times of labour disputes.          It is a matter for consideration as to whether the poster          should be signed by the Prime Minister or by any other          Minister, or whether it should bear at the head the letters         , &quot;0.H.M.S&quot;.pEOREOY,        In the past the methods of dealing with an emergency,          and  even the fact&apos;that the Government, was prepared to take          any  steps at all, were shrouded in a certain atmosphere of          secrecy.  That was clue to the supposition that a considerable          party in the State might be in opposition to the  action of the          Government,  Vila ether that supposition was well or ill founded          it is obviously-incorrect with a Labour Government in office,          There is nothing to be-ashamed of in action which will tend          to preserve the essential services and the life of *he people.          We should assume, and ri^tly, that public opinion would be          behind us, - tfise publicity would be desirable, rather than          the  reverse, more especially as we should deal, not,only with         ,.- recruiting, but also with profiteering and distribution of
food.  The following matters should,  however,  still he regarded as seoret:-     (1) Cabinet papers and proceedings of Committees        dealing with emergency matters.     (2) Air mail, Wireless schemes, etc., for these        presuppose a condition of dislocation, with        possible sabotage by irresponsible members        of the oemmunity.  They deal with matters        Of organisation and detail, which do not        affect the general principle that maintenance        of the essentials Of life and the well-being        of the community is a primary duty of the        Government, and must rest upon popular sanction.If unnecessary secrecy is dispensed with, the fact that civil  Commissioners are detailed to look after specialdistricts will beoome known, but these appointmentshave always been made public when  the emergency tookplace,  and I  see no reason why they should be kept secret at any other time.     In the past recruiting  arrangements have been  dualin  character.  The  Local Authorities have been held responsible for recruiting  for all local services,  and about  eighty  Chairmen of  Recruiting Committees havebeen responsible for  the  recruitment  of labour for more general  purposes.   Originally, the idea  of using independent Chairmen  to help recruiting for general purposes  was  the. certainty of  loyal  co-operation.   Therewere doubts entertained  as  to  the  co-operation that might be  received from seme JJOG&amp;1 Authorities.  I think,that these  doubts  were  protably unfounded  in  the past.   There
is less ground for presupposing disloyalty on thepart of the local Authorities in future.  I thinkthat the dual system of recruiting might well continue for the present, as being a system that has worked.I recommend, however, that, where practicable, andsubject to the approval of the Civil Commissioners andtheir Assistants, the Chairman&apos;of any RecruitingCommittee., when a chcnge occurs, should be the Mayoror the Chairman of the County Council,  or someo.nodirectly representing them.  This would ensuregreater co-ordination between the two- recruitingsystems.  It would be more economical,  and would obtain both accommodation and information which might otherwise be difficult for an independent Chairmen toacquire.                          &quot; (Intd.1  J.C.W.21st  March,  1924.
