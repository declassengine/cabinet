DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT *         U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW - PROPOSED LEGISLATION                     REDUCING QUOTA.                 HOTE  BY  MINISTER  OF  LABOUR.2?p(S4).           1.   I have read the memorandum (CP. 277(24)) oiroulated           by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and wish           to make a suggestion as to the  action which I think           shyuld be taken.           2.   I understand the Johnson Bill has been passed by the           House of Representatives and another Bill (the Reed Bill)           by the Senate and that the two Houses are now trying to           agree upon a Joint Bill.   The Johnson Bill contains the           clause about the division of the quota for the British           Islands.  I dp not know whether the Reed Bill contains a           similar olause, but whether it does cr not I think it is           likely that the Joint Bill will contain such a clause.           3.   If any action is to be taken, it should be taken           without delay:   otherwise we may easily find ourselves           too late,           4.   In my opinion, we cannot make any representations           on such a subject to the U.S. Government except on lines           concurred in by the Freo State Government.  The first           step is, therefore, to ascertain the views of the Free           State Government.           5.   What I should wish tt suggest to the Free State           Government is not that the division of the quota should           be objected to, but that power should be taken in the U.S.           legislation to enable the British Islands quota to be           treated as undivided in any year in  respect of which the           Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, of           the Free State both asked that this should be done,   if &quot;the                                                              /quota9 if)0 O
quota is cotepulsorily divided it nay easily happen that in oneyear one of the countries may fall below its quota, whilethe other cannot send as many emigrants as it wishes,and in another year the positions may be reversed;  theresult would be that on the average neither country would send its full quota.6.   It is suggested by the Secretary of. State that if theJohnson Bill bocomos law 3ome arrangement between us and theFree State Government as to division of the quota might bepossible.  This is much on the lines of,-, what I suggest, but could only be done if the terms of the U.S. law permitted.  The.Johnson Bill as now framed does not seem to permit of such anarrangement and would therefore need amendment for the purpose.7.   If the Free State Government does not fall in with thesuggestion, I do not see that anything more could be done.  Ifthey do fall in with it - as I should hope they would - the nextstep would be to instruct our Ambassador at Washington to take appropriate steps at the right moment to put forward the representation in the proper quarter.P.   I  suggest, therefore, that      (a)  immediate  steps,should be taken  to sound the Free           State Government  on the  lines suggested:      (b)   if the Free State Government concur, appropriate           instructions  should be given to &quot;our Ambassador.                                       (intd.) T.  S.Ministry of Labour.laFHay, T934.
