M f                        _\       (24)                HOLIDAYS WITH PAY AHD NIGHT BAKIHG.                Memorandum by the Home Secretary,          I  understand that there is some apprehension as to whether   -  the  inclusion  in the Bill of the proposed Clause  providing for     annual  holidays on full pay for factory workers may not prove     so controversial as to jeopardise the passing of  the Bill.          The  Clause (44) is as follows  :                &quot;Every person&quot; employed  in a factory  who has com-             pleted twelve months&quot;&apos;  continuous service with the same             employer shall be entitled  to and accorded a.holiday             of at least six consecutive days on,full pay,  and             similarly for each subsequent twelve  months of             completed service.                 The amount of the- full  pay of a person employed on             piece work shall, in default of agreement, be calculated             in the prescribed manner  i.e. prescribed by the             Secretary of State&apos;] .          A movement in this direction on a voluntary basis ha\^ made     considerable progress in the country and there  already exist..     a large  number of collective agreements on the  subject between              v     employers  and  workpeople.  A list of these was  given in the     Ministry of Labo\;.r Gazette -for  December 1922 and  trades in     which general  (as apart from sectional) agreements had by then    been adopted are indicated &apos;also on page 5 of my memorandum,     CP. 381 (24),  covering the  draft Bill.   They  included boots     and  shoes,  Railways(Traffic Section),  printing, confectionery,     tramwajrs,  gas  undertakings ac.   1 feel that  the time  has come,     and  that the opportunity presented by the Factory Bill  should    be taken,  to give legal force to the practice for factory    workers  generally.    &quot;&quot;&quot;Note,-,-  The word &quot;young&quot;  in the print  of  the Bill as  circulated             is a  mistake and. should be  deleted.
       On the other hand controversy will doubtless be raised on account of the additional charge to irduBtry and be cause,  for the first time in the history of the Factory Acts,  a provision of this nature is extended to all workmen and is not limited to women and young persons.       The Bill is coming before the Home Affairs Committee on Friday, and.I should be glad if the Cabinet could reach a decision an this particular point.to-morrow.       The Bill also includes a clause (55) for the  prohibition of night baking.   I would call attention to the remarks  on pages  7-8 of my memorandum CP.381 and ask for the  decision of my  colleagues as to&quot;whether this clause should be included in the Factories Bill or noto   I might add that the Inter- national Labour Conference meets next month and that as  the Bill will not be passed by then it would be possible to  alter the clause to accord with any Convention arrived at, whereas if it  is not inserted in the Bill as introduced separate legislation may be necessary.                                     A.H.,  1924.
