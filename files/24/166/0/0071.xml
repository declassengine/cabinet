Following  a  conference between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos;  Federation  and the  Unions concerned, it was  agreed that the  claim for  a general increase of 10/- per week and the claim  in  relation to Southampton should be referred to arbitration.   The  terms of reference have not yet been agreed to.
