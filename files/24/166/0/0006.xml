mCUMEKTJCS THE PROPERTY OP HIS EEIITAHNIC^ MAJESTY&apos;S,GOVERNMENT)C R E T. 206 (24kCABINET,     I think it necessary to bring to the attention of mycolleagues the present position of the County Courts bill and the serious results which may follow if that Bill doesnot become las at a very early date.     I will not here describe in detail the proposals of theBill which have been already set out in memoranda circulatedto the Cabinet.   It is enough to say that the Bill proposesto regularise the position of the clerks and bailiffs employed h the Courts, to place them upon regular scales of salary,and to provide pensions upon their retirement from the service.     The arrangements between the Treasury, the LordChancellor&apos;s Department, and the Association representingthe clerks have been embodied in an agreement which was arrivedat after much negotiation.   For some years before agreement was reached, the grievances of the clerks had been admitted by the Departments concerned.   In 1920 the Swift committee reported that the &quot;system.........^requires.......a radicaloverhaul................  In some instances clerks of several years experience are paid less than the wage at the present day of an unskilled manual labourer.   Such r.en cannot afford to retire and are kopt on from natives of charity after they  have passed an age when they can render efficient service.......... The retaining of these clerks in their present positionoperates harshly upon the junior olerks, it causes stagnation,is uneconomic and tends to inefficiency&quot;.
      There was  grave  unr eat-among  the clerks and. under- bailiffs, but they were Induced  to refrain from any violent action because  they anticipated  upon the promise held out to  them that their grievances would be remedied.   If the Bill, which embodies  an agreement made during the Coolition Government, approved  by the Conservative Government, and adopted by  the present  Government is not passed into law at an early date, serious consequences may ensue.   The officials of the Clerks Association have hitherto stood loyally by the agreement and have persuaded, the rank and  file to await the passing of the Bill.   But when  it is realised that the fulfilment of the promises made is  to be postponed indefinitely,, theymay. be unable or unwilling further to restrain their members.In  any strike the clerks would, by reason of the admissions^-made to them officially, be entitled to rely upon the general-sympathy &apos;of&apos;the public.   The administrative consequences would be most serious.   The work of the County Courts would-be  stopped.   Payments made under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation&apos;Act would cease to be made as the maohinery of the  Courtswould disappear.     On the other side very Serious consequences will ensueto  the Exchequer if the Bill is not passed.    During the period between the conclusion of the agreement already referred toand the passing of the Bill, the ordinary operations for thegrant of increments to the clerks have been stayed-,  and hitherto,though there has been&apos;considerable dissatisfaction,  it has beenpossible to inform both the clerks and the registrars that thematter would be dealt with when the Bill passed and the savings which, the Bill  contemplates began to be realised.    this position cannot be maintained if there is further delay. It  will be necessary  to resume&quot;.the allotment of increments and
 to do so on a scale larger than that, in force before the war, since the agreement in Its terms&quot;admits that the increments hitherto granted were insufficient ,    The result will be that almost all the financial disadvantages to the Exchequer flowing from the agreement will Come into immediate operation, and on the other hand,  that the Exchequer will not gain tlie compen-  sating advantages.      The Bill not only Imposes ho fresji burden on the Exchequer but should result In-a saving.
