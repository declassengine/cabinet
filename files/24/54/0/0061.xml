A GENERAL REVIEW OF THE NAVAL SITUATION

(APRIL, 1917, TO JUNE, 1918).

ADMIRALTY,

June 15th, 1918.
SECRET.REVIEW OF  THE NAVAL  SITUATION.Daring the period which has elapsed since the Imperial War Cabinet held its last meetings, no change of outstanding importance has taken place in the Naval situation, and the Navy has continued to pursue its objects, which may be summarised briefly :-(a) To attack and, if possible, destroy the enemy&apos;s armed forces.(b) To prevent invasion or raids on the British coast.(c) To prevent supplies reaching the enemy.(d) To destroy enemy bases or to restrict his use of them.(e) To ensure the arrival of supplies in this country.(/) To maintain the sea communications of the armies fighting on the various fronts.The first four of these objects are reviewed more particularly in Section I, which deals with the situation in the North Sea. It will be seen that the enemy fleet has maintained a defensive policy, remaining in the security provided by elaborate minefields and coast defences, and no opportunity of attacking the High Seas Fleet has presented itself. The blockade has been tightened with increasing success, and the intervention of the United States in April, 1917, has relieved the British Navy of a small though increasing portion of the heavy responsibility which it had hitherto borne.The important operations which were carried out with the object of blocking the ports- of Zeebrugge and Ostend were attended with a high measure of success, and have proved of great value in restricting the use of those ports as bases for enemy craft.The last two objects, which have relation almost entirely to anti-submarine measures, are dealt with in Section. IV. Anti-Submarine Situation, and Section VI.  Transportation of Personnel and Materiel for Overseas Expeditions, and to a less extent in Section I. Situation in the North Sea (Minelaying), Section III. Situation in Foreign Waters, and Section V. Naval Aircraft Situation.Though the enemy\s submarine campaign is still the most important factor in the Naval situation, the position is steadily improving; the shipping losses are gradually decreasing, and it can be claimed that since January 1st enemy submarines have been destroyed at least at the same rate as the enemy has built them.That the sea communications have been adequately maintained is instanced by the fact that, during the week ended 6th April, 763 British vessels sailed from ILK. Ports to French Ports without a single vessel being lost.The work of the Navy is dealt with in some detail in the following pages, and it will be seen how various and widespread its activities are. With the single exception of the Mediterranean Sea, the responsibility for the direction of operations in all theatres in which the enemy displays activity, rests with the British Navy.1.-SITUATION IN THE NORTH SEA.-General. There has been no change in the strategical policy governing the employment of the Grand Fleet during the period under review, viz., the maintenance of the Blockade of Germany and the defence of the British Islands against invasion.The main portion of the Grand Fleet is still normally based in the far North whilst the Battle Cruiser Force is based further South.The disadvantages from this unavoidable separation of the two portions of the Fleet have been overcome from time to time, during periods when enemy activity has been expected, by concentrating the whole Grand Fleet at one of the East Coast ports. This condition, however, cannot be maintained at all times, owing to congestion, difficulties of carrying out exercises, etc., and therefore the disadvantage of having the Fleet divided still obtains during the major portion of the year.The recent blocking of the ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend has greatly facilitated the work of the Navy in the Southern area of the&apos;North Sea, since it has reduced the accommo-dation available for berthing enemy small craft, and has lessened the chances of raids by(01218)   60  6/18  H&amp;S &quot;
small craft on the Dover Straits and the East Coast. There has also been a marked diminution in minelaying by submarines since these ports were blocked.With the entry of America into the War, the difficulty of maintaining the blockade in the Northern waters has been reduced to a minimum, and the 10th Cruiser Squadron, which formerly carried out the blockade in those waters, has been freed for other work.Grand Fleet. The Grand Fleet, during the period under review, has been employed principally in the general control of the North Sea, including the protection of Scandinavian Convoys and support of minelaying forces. -The introduction of the Convoy System for Scandinavian Commerce has led to the employment of a portion of the Grand Fleet in support of ohese Convoys. The Convoy has been attacked on two occasions by superior forces necessitating the employment of still stronger escort squadrons.It is not, however, possible to employ forces in support of the Scandinavian Convoy which will always be superior to any force the enemy may decide to use against them, as this would necessitate the employment of the whole Grand Fleet on this service.It is fully realised that the running of this Convoy is not without danger. By increasing the strength of the supporting force the danger of the Convoy being attacked is reduced, and it is hoped that a raid in force on this Convoy may lead eventually to an action between the Grand Fleet and the German High Sea Fleet.Two sweeps have been carried out in the Kattegat by Light Cruisers and Destroyers supported by heavy ships. The object of. these operations was to attack enemy vessels and to sink his fishing craft. A considerable measure of success was obtained in both cases.Several operations have also been carried out by the Grand Fleet against enemy minesweepers in the Heligoland Bight.In the southern waters the light forces stationed at Harwich have been employed in attacking enemy vessels in the Heligoland Bight and in supporting minelaying forces. They have also.been used in support of the Dover Patrol when required.Many operations have been carried out by this force, but decisive results have not been obtained owing to the reluctance of the enemy to leave the protection of their minefields and fortifications.Our submarines stationed in the North Sea have been principally employed in patrol duties in the Heligoland Bight and Kattegat throughout the year, to intercept enemy submarines and to give information as to movements of surface vessels.Dover Patrol. The Dover Patrol has been employed during the year in operations against the enemy forces stationed at Zeebrugge and Ostend, but principally in denying the use of. the Dover Straits to enemy submarines. With this object in view an extensive mine barrage has been laid in the Straits within the last six months, continually patrolled by auxiliary patrol vessels supported by destroyers and monitors. The object of the surface craft is to force enemy submarines to dive into the deep minefield instead of passing the Straits on the surface. To facilitate this work at night the auxiliary patrol vessels have been fitted with flares, which light up the surrounding water and show up enemy submarines in their vicinity. The efficiency of this patrol is shown by the efforts made by the enemy to destroy the auxiliary patrol vessels, and the raids on the Dover Straits by enemy Destroyers have doubtless been carried out with this object in view, and also in the endeavour to clear the patrol vessels temporarily out of the way so that their submarines may pass in or out in safety.At. present the enemy has no port on the Flanders Coast which will accommodate vessels larger than destroyers.Many bombardments of Ostend and Zeebrugge have been carried out by monitors during the period under review, and attacks on enemy surface craft in the harbours and at sea have been made by coastal motor boats.&quot; -    &quot;:      ,v    ;:        : *&quot;&apos;*&apos;: ZZ.&quot;. &apos;&quot;&apos; ; &apos; K&apos;    1&apos; : : &quot;   j Zy Z : ; &apos;ZyZZy :    &apos;Z&apos;y    &apos;.y : :       -Y&apos;V.&quot;. ;    &apos; Z:)Zr:[y- y y : : : &apos;;. ;    :  ;    -   :       &quot;y       .   .   y Z-&apos;    . ./ &quot;    ;Minelaying. In order to deal more effectively with German submarines an intensive mining policy has been adopted during the past 12 months.This policy has two objects in view  .  .(a) To prevent submarines leaving their base via the Heligoland Bight, and if possible to destroy them if they do so.(b) To confine their activity to the North Sea Waters and thus relieve the pressure on &apos; our seaborne commerce.
With regard to (a) a regular system of minelaying has been adopted so as to form a dangerous area right across the approaches to the Heligoland Bight. The natural effect of this has been to force the enemy to carry out minesweeping operations on a large scale. This in turn necessitates constant reinforcement of the minefields in order to obstruct the channels which the enemy has swept clear for the exit of his submarines.That the results have on the whole been satisfactory is shown by the increased use of the Kattegat by enemy submarines. This in itself is an advantage as it increases the distance the submarines have to go to reach their areas of operations and reduces the time they can remain in those areas.&quot;&quot;As regards (b) the first step was to block the Straits of Dover by broad minefields extending across the Straits from the British to the French shores and thus force the submarines to use the north-about route. This has now been completed and the results are satisfactory.The next step was to block the north-about route in a similar manner. Minelaying operations have been carried out on a large scale and are still in progress. Both British and United States minelayers are being employed in these operations.The mine barrage in the Straits of Dover and in the northern part of the North Sea in themselves are not sufficient to prevent the passage of enemy submarines, and intensive patrols of. the mined areas are necessary in order to force the submarines to pass through the mine barrage and to dive into the deep minefields.Large numbers of Auxiliary Craft are therefore employed to patrol these areas, sup-ported by sloops and other vessels. The patrol of the Dover Straits is now fully established as already described, but the Northern Patrol is still in process of formation, although a large number of trawlers and sloops are at the present time employed on this duty. It must be realised that as the barrage increases in efficiency and extent the danger from attack by enemy surface craft must increase.It will not be possible to maintain supporting forces of heavy ships always at sea of sufficient strength to meet any forces the enemy can employ to raid the barrage craft.These risks must, therefore, be accepted, and, as in the case of the Scandinavian Con-, voys, it is quite possible that an attempted raid on the Northern Patrol by strong enemy forces may lead to an action between the main Fleets.It may be of interest to state here the number of mines that have been laid in the North Sea area during the twelve months under review.These are: The number of mines laid in recent months has greatly increased and will continue to do so in the future.German High Seas Fleet. No big operations have been undertaken by the High Sea Fleet in the North Sea as far as can be ascertained.On two occasions attacks have been made by German light vessels on our Scandinavian Convoys, but, beyond this, German surface craft have shown little activity in the northern part of the North Sea.Portions of the High Sea Fleet were employed in the Eastern Baltic during the Riga operations in the autumn of 1917, and again during the Finland operations in April, 1918.The Flanders Flotillas stationed at Zeebrugge and Ostend have carried out several raids on the auxiliary vessels of the Dover Patrol. These have in most cases led to indecisive night actions with our light forces.II.-SITUATION IN HOME WATERS OTHER THAN THE NORTH SEA.The operations in these waters have been almost entirely confined to offensive and defensive measures against enemy submarines and mines and protection of merchant shipping.  A full review of these matters is contained in Sections IV/ and VI.By surface vessels By submarines49,354 1,562Total50,916
III. SITUATION IN FOREIGN WATERS.(a) Mediterranean.The Mediterranean Station of the British Fleet now extends from the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb to the meridian of Cape St. Vincent. A British Commander-in-Chief has been appointed who commands all British Naval forces within these limits, and who in addition is in charge of all Allied patrols and escorts in the Mediterranean and issues orders as to routes and control of traffic, for which purpose he is assisted by an Allied Commission of Flag Officers sitting at Malta. The British C-in-C. also directs the anti-sub-marine operations of the French Naval forces. He is, however, with all the forces under his orders, subject to the general control of the French C-in-C., who is in supreme command of all Allied Naval forces in the Mediterranean with the exception of the Adriatic.The headquarters of the British C-in-C. and the British Fleet are at Malta. The British, French, Italian, Japanese, U.S., and Greek Navies all contribute to the forces employed on escort duties throughout the Mediterranean, these escort forces being all controlled by the British C.-in-C.Apart from the escort forces, the areas in which the British Navy operates are Gibraltar, Adriatic, iEgean, Egypt and the Red Sea.The defence of the Straits of Gibraltar and arrangements for the control of commerce are carried out by the British S.N.O. at Gibraltar. The French Morocco Squadron and a U.S. Squadron work under his general control, and in the course of the next few days a Brazilian Squadron of two Light Cruisers and four Destroyers will leave Brazil for Gibraltar, where they will be based and will operate under British orders.The British Squadron in the Adriatic under a Commodore works under the general -control of the Italian C-in-C. A mobile barrage of British craft has recently been formed to block the Otranto Straits against the passage of enemy submarines.A fixed net barrage across the Straits is also in process of construction, combined with minefields, and when the complete barrage is in operation it is hoped to render the passage of the Straits exceedingly hazardous for the enemy. This, if successful, will very greatly simplify the protection of traffic, as the enemy submarines in the Mediterranean will either have to return to Germany on the completion of each cruise, or proceed to Constantinople, where repair facilities, etc., are on a very inferior scale compared to the Austrian bases of Cattaro, Pola, etc. Except for a Squadron of Light Cruisers, the British forces in the Adriatic are entirely employed on anti-submarine offensive operations, but there are also two British monitors based on Venice for work in co-operation with the Italian Army. A Squadron of U.S. Submarine Chasers is now joining the Otranto Barrage Force.In the iEgean the naval forces up till now have been principally British, the French Squadron in this area being under the orders of the British Rear-Admiral. Now, however, in order to meet the menace of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in the hands of. Germany, it has become necessary to send a Squadron of French Battleships to this area. The control of the area, including the blockade of the coasts of Bulgaria and Turkey, remains in the hands of the British It.A. The Greek Fleet has recently been added to the Allied force in the iEgean, and works under British orders. A force of British monitors is continually employed in co-operation with the right flank of the British Army on the Struma front in Macedonia.In Egypt the British Squadron operates on the Palestine coast as required in co-operation with the left flank of the Army, being assisted Avhen necessary by a French Squadron.In the Red Sea the force is entirely British, and is charged Avith the blockade of the Arabian coast, coastal operations in support of the Arab forces against the Turks, and the guarding of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.(b) East Indies.The limits of the East Indies Station have been altered, consequent on the inclusion of the Red Sea in the Mediterranean command, and now extend from the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb to roughly the western point of Sumatra, including the Persian Gulf. This change has simplified administration, as all the waters in which the Government of India
are specially interested are now under the control of the same British Admiral. A force of five Light Cruisers is maintained&apos; on this Station for the protection of the Trade Routes, in addition to the Royal Indian Marine ships that have been placed at the disposal of the Admiralty.It is intended to release two of the largest of these R.I.M. ships in the immediate future from Naval Service, and the Government of India have been asked to allow them to be used as Transports, for which purpose they were originally built. This will release two good cargo-carrying steamers for trade purposes. Since the raider &quot; Wolf &quot; returned to Germany, there has been no enemy activity in these, waters, but in the event of another raider appearing it would be necessary to institute convoys to the extent that our small force of light cruisers will allow. Two French light cruisers also are serving on this Station under the orders of the British C-in-C. There is besides a small force of British and R.I.M. gunboats, etc., for service in the Persian Gulf.Owing to the demands for naval personnel for more strictly naval services, the gunboat flotilla on the Tigris and Euphrates has been almost entirely transferred to the Army. 16 gunboats on the rivers are manned and worked entirely by the Army, 4 have been sent to the Yangtze, and only 2 of the larger gunboats manned by the Navy remain in Mesopotamia. The Naval Depot and workshops at Basra have been turned over to the Army.The mines laid by &quot; Wolf&quot; have not yet all been accounted for, and minesweeping is still continuously in progress in the approaches to Bombay and Colombo.(c) China.The British Squadron on the China Station consists of 2 cruisers, 1 sloop, and 3 old destroyers. Of the two cruisers one has been at Vladivostock since January for protection of British, life and property and to prevent the removal of the munitions, etc., stored there, which are the property of the Allies. Her orders are to work in close co-operation with the Japanese and U.S. Admirals at Vladivostock. The other cruiser has been ordered to Shanghai and will be employed in transporting enemy subjects deported from China to Australia.Owing to the serious unrest in the Yangtze valley caused by the fighting between the Northern and Southern Armies in China, and the fact that peaceful shipping has been molested, it has become necessary to maintain once more a gunboat flotilla in the Yangtze. Five of the old Yangtze gunboats have been commissioned, of which 2 are on the Upper Yangtze, and the flotilla has been reinforced by 4 large gunboats from Mesopotamia.The minefield known to have been laid by &apos;&apos; Wolf&quot; somewhere in the neighbourhood of Singapore has not yet been located, and searching is still in progress.The Japanese Navy provides the principal force for the China Station, and a. squadron of cruisers and destroyers are stationed in the Malacca Straits, where they work as requested by the British C-in-C. These Japanese cruisers are available for the protection of the trade route between Australia and Ceylon if necessary, assisted by whatever British cruisers are available from China and Australia.(d) austkalasia.The six Australian Destroyers form part of the Flotilla in the Mediterranean, where they are employed on the Otranto Barrage. The Australian light cruiser &quot; Brisbane&quot; has returned to Australia and with &quot;Encounter,&quot; &quot;Fantome,&quot; and various small craft is available for protection of trade.A Japanese light cruiser is also on this Station.Since the return of &quot;Wolf&quot; to Germany, and the wreck of &quot;Seeadler&quot; and &quot;Lutece,&quot; there has been no enemy activity in these waters.The mines laid by Wolf&quot; in Cook Strait and at Three Kings have not yet all been accounted for, and searching is still in progress.(e) Pacific.The demand for more escorting cruisers for Atlantic Convoys has necessitated the reduction of this squadron by one ship, and it now consists of 1 cruiser and 2 firmed merchant cruisers. The work of the Navy on this Station has been rendered less arduous by reason of ships being able to coal and effect repairs in Peruvian and Ecuadorean
waters. The necessity for watching the enemy steamers in Chilian ports still exists in addition to the necessity for protecting the trade routes, should a raider appear in those waters.(/) East Coast op S. America.The entry of Brazil into the war and the friendly attitude of Uruguay have enabled the British Squadron on this Station to be reduced to two light cruisers only. Rio de Janeiro is the headquarters of both the British and U.S. Squadrons on this Station, and the patrol of the sea routes is divided between the two squadrons.As has been previously stated, Brazil is sending a squadron of 2 light cruisers and 4 destroyers to Gibraltar to work with the other Allied Squadrons, and such other ships as she has available are emploj^ed on the protection of her own coasts. Owing to the difficulty in providing such material as boiler tubes, condenser tubes, etc., a considerable part of the Brazilian Navy cannot carry out more than purely local work.(g) West Coast oe Africa.This Squadron, known as the 9th Cruiser Squadron, has also been reduced in order to provide more escorts for the increased number of convoys, and now consists of 2 pre-Dreadnought battleships and 1 cruiser. There is also 1 old light cruiser and 1 gunboat stationed at Victoria, Cameroons, for protection against attempts by the German forces interned in Fernando Po to return to the mainland. The two battleships are used as cruisers for escorting transports between Sierra Leone and the Cape.Enemy submarines have recently been active in the vicinity of Sierra Leone where mines were laid, and one submarine bombarded the W/T Station at Monrovia. The mine-sweeping force at Sierra Leone has been reinforced, and 3 small craft have been armed, 1 for general patrol duties and the other 2 for local defence at Lagos and Bathurst re-spectively. Arrangements are also being made to mount a light battery at Accra for the protection of the cables.A French light cruiser is stationed, at Dakar, and various small craft are employed on the coast to the northward.(h) Cape and East Coast of Africa.The enemy land forces having been driven south into Portuguese East Africa, the coast line to be actively patrolled by the Navy is less than it was, though the nominal blockade has been extended to the southward as far as the mouth of the Ligonha River.The squadron has been reduced by 1 cruiser and 1 armed merchant cruiser, and now consists of 4 light cruisers and 2 gunboats. The monitors being no longer required for operations in German East Africa have been sent to the Mediterranean.Minesweeping is still in progress off the Cape.The small Portuguese squadron in East Africa has been placed under the orders of the British C-in-C.One Japanese light cruiser is stationed at the Cape.(i) West Indies.The command in the Caribbean is vested in the French Admiral, who has 1 French cruiser and 2 U.S. light cruisers under his orders. A British flotilla of a few small armed steamers and motor launches is maintained for minesweeping and local patrol purposes, principally at Trinidad, Barbadoes and St. Lucia.The more important anchorages have also been protected by mounting some old naval guns, which should be able to deter an enemy submarine from attacking shipping in the roadsteads by gunfire.(j) North America.The British C-in-C. now has his headquarters at Washington in order to be in closer touch with the U.S. naval authorities. There are no British cruisers or armed merchant cruisers on this Station as formerly constituted, all being employed on escort duties with the Trans-Atlantic Convoys.
In view of the menace from the new German submarine cruisers, local patrol forces are being developed as rapidly as possible by Canada and Newfoundland, who are also arranging protection for the fishing fleets. Some assistance is looked for from U.S., should the menace become more threatening.The two Canadian submarines C.C.1 and C.C.2 have been sent round from Esquimault to Halifax, where they are stationed for local anti-submarine purposes. &quot;Shear-water &quot; escorted the submarines on the voyage, and is doing useful work on the North America and West India Station generally. As an example of her use, it may be mentioned that she carried a detachment of Marines from Bermuda to Antigua on the occasion of the recent riots in that Island.(k) Murman Coast and White Sea.The Finnish Government, having recently announced its intention to annex the Murman Coast and Karelia, is preparing an army under German Command to seize the Pechenga Inlet and possibly the Kola Inlet. The Allies are endeavouring to prevent these ice-free harbours from falling under Finnish-German control, and certain Military action is being taken to hold the Northern Ports of Russia against either Finnish or German occupation.The Naval forces acting in co-operation with the Military forces now consist of:  British. French. American.Battleship &quot; Glory.&quot; Cruiser &quot; Amiral Aube.&quot;      Cruiser &quot; Olympia.&quot;Cruiser &quot; Cochrane.&quot; Light Cruiser &quot; Attentive.&quot; Special Service Vessel, &quot; Tayarid Tyne.&quot; 16 Trawlers.Icebreaker &quot; Alexander.&quot;IV.-ANTI-SUBMARINE SITUATION.General. As in March, 1917, the most important factor in the Naval situation to-day is the enemy&apos;s submarine campaign against the shipping of the Allies.In the report made on the 24th March, 1917, to the Imperial War Cabinet, the average monthly losses of British Merchant Ships between October, 1916, and January, 1917, were given as 48 ships, (161,023 tons), and it was stated that, owing to the method of sinking ships without warning which the enemy had adopted on 1st February ^ 1917, much heavier losses must be expected in the next few months. The losses during 1917 have been very heavy, the average monthly sinkings due to enemy action and marine risks having been as follows: Average Monthly Losses.	British.	Foreign.	Total.To end of September, 1916        ............	91,323	61,239	155,5624th Quarter 1916   ..................	205,854	180,594	386,4481st           1917..................	303,947	235,844	539,7912nd          1917   ..................	453,957	291,688	745,6453rd          1917   ..................	317,646	180,512	498,1584th    ,,    1917   ..................	260,963	163,318	424,2811st     ,,    1918   ..................	231,793	149,117	380,910For the present quarter there has been so far a further reduction, but it will be realised that the situation is still serious, as the net loss of British shipping since the commencement of the war has been about 3^ million tons. Notwithstanding this, the position is less menacing now than in March, 1917, greater efforts are being made in ship-building. Though we cannot claim that the submarine has yet been mastered, so far as can be foreseen the enemy&apos;s hope of obtaining a decision by this method has practically disappeared.
The principal factor in reducing losses from enemy submarine attack lias undoubtedly been the introduction of the Convoy system of regulating sailings and affording protection to Merchant Ships through the most dangerous part of their voyage. Other defensive measures include arming the Merchant Ships with guns of 6-inch and below, the use of smoke apparatus, the Otter defence gear against mines, and the holding, of instructional courses for masters and officers, so that they may take the right steps if attacked.Side by side with the development of the defensive there has been an even greater elaboration of offensive measures, and we are now able to claim that we are sinking submarines at least as fast as the enemy is building them, while there are not wanting signs that in some cases, at all events, the ever-present fear of attack is beginning to affect the morale of the crews.The main lines on which the offensive has been extended, are (1) in rendering the exit and return of the submarine difficult and dangerous by blocking his harbours with sunken ships at Zeebrugge and Ostend and of the approaches to his other ports by extensive mine fields; (2) by strengthening the barrage at the eastern end of the English Channel by minefields and surface craft; (3) the fitting of destroyers and all patrol vessels to carry greatly increased numbers of depth charges and; (4) the development of scientific devices for detecting and locating a submarine while operating or on passage.In addition to the Admiralty Experimental Stations, centres have been established at Manchester and on the Clyde, where the leading scientists, engineers and manufacturers are engaged in working out practical methods of utilizing the properties of sound, electricity and magnetism in anti-submarine warfare. Considerable progress has been made and we are now able to follow a submarine for hours without seeing her, to hear when she passes certain fixed points and to get an idea of her distance. The gradual simplification and improvements in the accuracy of instruments which is in progress, as well as the intro-duction of new devices, will, it is hoped, presently render the destruction of submarines more certain.- The combined result of offensive and defensive measures, which overlap and cannot be properly separated, is that from the time a submarine leaves its base until it returns it is in clanger of sudden destruction, and that in consequence it is beginning to look upon itself as one of the hunted quite as much as a hunter.So far as enemy submarines themselves are concerned, some of a larger type are now being used, and they are able to operate at longer distances from their base. Owing, however, to the system of routeing merchant ships, the submarines&apos; chances of finding them on the high seas are small, and they are likely, therefore; to operate mainly off terminal ports at a distance. Unless, however, they can obtain supplies especially of torpedoes from a local base, or from some other source, it does not seem likely that their powers for mischief will be any greater than those of smaller submarines operating round our coasts. Their greatest use is probably to be found in the hope of causing, on our part, a dispersal of effort in dealing with them, in the same way that their minelaying submarines round the coast are used to absorb in sweeping Operations a large number of small craft who would otherwise be employed in more effective ways.In the Mediterranean, which is an ideal operating ground for submarines, their activity has increased very considerably during the year, but here also the measures being taken hold out a reasonable hope of success. A barrage of hunting craft has been established across the southern end of the Adriatic, and the passage of submarines through that area has been in consequence rendered more difficult.In the whole of the anti-submarine warfare in which we are engaged we are in close touch with our-Allies. American destroyers have done an immense amount of convoy escort work in the Atlantic ; French, Italian and Japanese vessels work with ours in the Mediterranean; every new method of meeting the menace is at once passed on to1 all con-cerned and each new invention is at the disposal of all.On the whole, therefore, it may be said that a considerable amount of success has been achieved during the year, and that there are good grounds for anticipating still better results in the coming months.Minelaying. With regard &quot;to the minelaying activities of enemy submarines, the menace from mines in Home Waters, which was at its maximum in the spring and summer of 1917, decreased slightly in the numbers laid towards the autumn, and still more so in the winter of 1917 and spring of this year.   At present the number of mines . laid by submarines is approximately 50 per cent, less than in the spring of 1917.  The
enemy&apos;s system of laying large and concentrated groups of mines on the congested traffic routes was, in the autumn of 1917, altered to scattering the mines over a wider area, which certainly presents more difficulty to the sweepers and this difficulty has been increased by the enemy adopting a method of delaying the release of mines.The following table indicates the results achieved in dealing with the mine menace:-1917.	Mines swept up.	Merchant Vessels sunk or damaged by mine.	M/S Vessels mined.	Total Vessels mined for every mine swept.January to March     ...... April to June   ......... July to September     ...... * October to December	1,109 1,343 1,178 657	47 42 &apos;24 24	24 40 14 11	1 for every 15 mines. 1 for every 17 mines. 1 for every 31 mines. 1 for every 19 mines.1918.

As has been stated the principal factor in bringing about a reduction in loss of merchant tonnage by submarine action during the past year has been the application of the Convoy system to vessels trading in dangerous waters. The follow-ing is a brief history of the introduction of this method of protection.Up to March, 1917, the general principle under which Merchant Ships were sailed was to give them special independent routes based on the latest information as to submarine and mining activity. Under this system, each ship was given a separate route and as far as practicable the routes were varied from time to time. Dangerous areas, such as the Approach Routes to the United Kingdom, were patrolled and the general idea was to guard an area rather than to guard any particular ships. Exceptions were made in the case of specially valuable ships, such as oilers, for which special escorts were provided ; in the case of troopships proceeding overseas, Convoys were formed and a cruiser escort provided for the oversea voyage, as well as a special Destroyer escort in the submarine danger zone.From March., 1917, the system of independent sailings was gradually superseded by a system of sailing ships together in Convoy. The system was first introduced in the French Coal Trade from the United Kingdom to France and back. .This is a modified form of Convoy, which is designated &quot; Controlled sailing,&quot; as its main feature is that the ships sail together from a certain place and at a certain time, the time being controlled according to the submarine situation; a small escort is provided, but the great advantage is that they are controlled in the time of sailing and in the route.This system has proved very satisfactory, the total number of ships included from March, 1917, to 30th May, 1918, being 23,237, with a loss of 42 ships, i.e., 0.18 per cent.In April, 1917, the Convoy system was introduced for the trade between the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. This Convoy, in addition to some losses from enemy sub-marines, was twice attacked by surface craft, on which occasions it suffered considerable loss.

The presence of an escort and the knowledge that in case of attack help will immediately be available, as well as the knowledge that neither masters nor men are likely to be taken prisoners by an enemy submarine, have combined to strengthen the morale of the Merchant Service personnel.The Mercantile Marine has adapted itself to the convoy system and the handling of merchant ships in convoy has now become most satisfactory.The system continued in force with some modifications for nine months, during which 6,475 vessels were included, with a total loss of 75 or 1.15 per cent.In January, 1918, the system was altered, and since then to the 30th May, 1918, 1,930 ships have been included, with a total loss of 11 or 0.57 per cent.In May, .1917, an experiment was tried of sailing organised Convoys in the Atlantic, one from Gibraltar and one from the United States. As the experiment proved successful, the system was gradually extended, until, at the present clay, practically the whole of the Homeward Atlantic Trade is in. Convoy during the voyage from North America, Gibraltar, and from varying points in the South Atlantic. A part of the Outward Atlantic Trade is also Convoyed during its passage through the Home submarine danger zone, and if bound for the Mediterranean, during the whole of its passage to Gibraltar. The general principle for Homeward Convoys is for a Convoy to be escorted by a cruiser during its Ocean passage, being met by a Destroyer escort on reaching the submarine danger zone.The figures for the Homeward Atlantic Convoys up to the 30th May, 1918, are 5,304 ships, with a loss of 56, i.e., 1.05 per cent.; for the Outward Atlantic Trade 4,467 ships, with a loss of 25, i.e., .56 percent. Note.- In these figures are included Convoys ivhich proceed direct between the United Kingdom and Port Said via the Mediterranean, composed of ships proceeding to and from the Par East.As regards the local Mediterranean Trade, practically the whole of the ships in the Mediterranean are now in Convoy and the figures from November, 1917, to 30th May, 1918, for ships Convoyed are 5,160 ships, with a loss of 80, i.e., 1.55 per cent.The total of the above figures is 46,573 ships, with a loss of 289, i.e., 0.62 per cent.The above figures do not include United States Convoys conveying troops direct from the United States to France, but they do include British ships carrying American troops to the United Kingdom, in addition to Oversea Dominion Troops brought to the United Kingdom or carried through, the Mediterranean.The Convoy system has necessarily required a large number of men-of-war, both as escort vessels for the Ocean voyages and also for the anti-submarine escort in Home or Mediterranean Waters. The vessels of the Allies have been utilised for this purpose, including ships from the Navies of France, Italy, United States and Japan. Destroyers of the Royal Australian Navy are also employed on this service.Aircraft has been brought into use for escorting Convoys and its work in this connection is being increasingly developed.The following table summarises the work performed in a month by H.M. Ships and Auxiliary Craft in connection with Convoy and Escort of Merchant Ships, Transports, &amp;c.
At the inauguration of the system delays to shipping were inevitable, but by close co-operation between the Ministry of Shipping and Admiralty, and by the arrangement of a definite convoy programme, it has become possible to so arrange that ships are loaded to catch definite convoys and work to a regular time-table; as a result, the ships are beginning to turn round quicker under the convoy system than they did previously, as masters and all concerned have now every inducement to get their ships ready to catch the first convoy possible.The system has also enabled a closer control of trade generally to be made and has facilitated any diversions of shipping, either on account of submarine or mining activity or trade requirements, as vessels in convoy or even the convoys themselves can be diverted at any moment as required.Courses of instruction. An important feature in the methods of countering the enemy&apos;s submarine has been the courses of instruction to- masters and other officers of the Merchant Service on the tactics and devices for defeating submarine attacks.The courses were started at the R.N. Barracks, Chatham, in February, 1917, as voluntary courses, and have been extended to Portsmouth, Devonport and Glasgow as numbers applying for them have increased.Up to the end of April, 1918, a total of 2,676 masters and 3,184 other officers have passed through these courses, which have proved to be of such value that it has recently been decided to make them compulsory for all deck officers of the Mercantile Marine.The utility of these courses lies chiefly in the confidence which they impart to officers who, before attending them, are inclined to regard the submarine as undefeatable, but leave them with the very different opinion that, if they carry out the Admiralty orders as explained and practised at the lectures, there is no reason why they should not escape if attacked.Defensive Armament of MercJiant Vessels. The progress which has been made in the provision of a gun armament as a means of defence against submarines is indicated by the fact that since 1st April, 1917, 3,063 guns and 553 howitzers have been mounted in Merchant Ships.The number of ships defensively armed is now approximately 3,500, leaving roughly 470 ships still to be armed. The latter number comprises ships repairing and vessels trading temporarily outside the recognised danger zones.Arrangements have been made to replace the lighter guns in these ships by guns of a heavier calibre as they become available.About 400 officers and men are employed in fitting out these vessels, the total personnel of the guns&apos; crews being approximately 10,500.Aircraft for anti-submarine work. During the period under review the employment of aircraft in the anti-submarine campaign has been instituted with very satisfactory results, and every effort is being made to extend the use of this weapon and establish a complete system of air patrol round our coasts.Airships and seaplanes for the purpose of escorting convoys through the danger zones, and aeroplanes for the patrol of waters adjacent to the coast, have proved of great value.  Full particulars will be found in Section V &quot; Naval Aircraft Situation.&quot;V.-NAVAL AIRCRAFT SITUATION. (a) Grand Fleet.The principle of flying aeroplanes off the turrets or decks of ships has been adopted, which enables flights to be made in weather which would prohibit the use of seaplanes and does not necessitate stopping the ship to hoist out seaplanes. Aeroplanes are fitted with flotational devices to give buoyancy for a short time after the flight is completed, whilst the machine is being salved by an attendant ship.  Small machines have success-
(6) North Sea.During the period under review, large Flying Boats commenced active operations from Felixstowe and Yarmouth, whence, carrying a crew of 5, and with a range of 400 miles, they have reconnoitred to the Dutch Coast, and as far east as Borkum. By the expedient of taking machines part of the way over on lighters towed by destroyers, and launching them off at dawn, it has been possible to reconnoitre to the coast of Schleswig-Holstein. In the course of these patrols, enemy mine-sweepers with their supporting forces have been sighted ; Zeppelins have frequently been sighted and attacked, and two have been destroyed. Many attacks on enemy submarines have been made by these boats, which, by reason of their excellent view ahead and bomb carrying capacity, are well adapted for the purpose. Lately, these reconnaissances have met great opposition from large formations of enemy aircraft, who have the advantage of working close to their bases. Our losses have recently been heavy.Defence Flights were formed round the coast to engage enemy aircraft, which were showing considerable activity during the spring of 1917 by their attacks on our shipping in the &quot; Downs.&quot; This was checked arid the flights reduced. At the present time enemy activity is again on the increase between Harwich and Texel, and it is quite evident that it is now necessary to provide long distance fighting machine squadrons for naval work; the matter has been brought to the notice of the Air Ministry.A contingent of the United States Aviation Service has arrived at Killingholme, with its machines, but has not yet commenced operations.At present our non-rigid airships have not sufficient performance to meet Grand Fleet requirements, but the smaller types have proved valuable for convoying and anti-submarine work.Five rigid airships have been completed, which are used experimentally and for training. In October 1917 the Zeppelin L.Z.49 was captured in France, and the infor-mation obtained from this ship has led to improvements being incorporated in rigid airships now building. Three rigid airships for use with the Fleet should be available this year.(c)  Dunkirk and Dover.During the early part of the period under review, several R.N.A.S. fighting squadrons -were lent to the R.F.C. to assist them during the Somme battle.Continuous reconnaissance, photographic and otherwise, has been carried out daiiy, weather permitting, from Dunkirk, and likewise fighting patrols. Aircraft are constantly employed with naval forces for spotting and bombing purposes.It is interesting to note that early in 1917 the Handley-Page night bombers were brought into use in France. The Germans also about this time introduced the Gotha bombing machine, with which they commenced raids on England by day, and later by night. These attacks were met with much opposition by our aircraft, both at home and from Dunkirk on their return.fully landed on deck and experiments in this direction are progressing. A ship with a completely flush deck is being provided from which much useful knowledge should be obtained.A number of Light Cruisers are fitted to carry a single-seater aeroplane, whose role is the attack of enemy aircraft, the defence of our own reconnaissance or spotting machines, and the denial to the enemy of the advantage of reconnaissance by aircraft. On one occasion a Zeppelin was destroyed.Two-seater machines for reconnaissance and spotting are now carried in Battle Cruisers, and it is possible that each capital -ship will do this in future.All aircraft in the Grand Fleet, except Kite Balloons, are under the Command of the Admiral Commanding Aircraft, flying his flag in H.M.S. &quot; Furious.&quot; This ship has been adapted to carry aeroplanes, being fitted with an experimental flying-on deck. There are three other Carriers attached to the Fleet which are being replaced by ships of greater speed and capable of working with a modern fleet.Kite balloons are carried in a proportion of the cruisers, destroyers and battleships, being used respectively for reconnaissance, anti-submarine work, and control of gunfire.
(d) Mediterranean, etc.General. A new organisation for Air Force contingents working under the orders of C-in-C, Mediterranean, has recently been adopted. The Force is divided into four groups, viz., at Malta, Adriatic, iEgean and Egypt, under the orders of a Brigadier-General, R.A.F., who is on the staff of C.-in-C., Mediterranean.The chief difficulty in the Mediterranean has been, and still is, one of water transport sufficient to maintain the supply of machines. To mitigate this, six aircraft carriers, too slow for the Grand Fleefs purposes, have been sent to the Mediterranean, and are used to ship out materiel from home and distribute it amongst the Mediterranean units. Large America seaplanes are being constructed at Malta, but the present output is very small.Adriatic. In April, 1917, a wing was sent to&apos; Southern Italy, and commenced operations with anti-submarine patrolling over the Otranto Straits, and this unit has since been expanded. In addition to these patrols, reconnaissance and bombing flights to Cattaro and other Austrian submarine and naval bases have been made, with the object of harassing submarines resting and refitting. Re-fuelling bases are being instituted to enable large aeroplanes to proceed from Gibraltar to Port Said and iEgean as required.Kite Balloon Stations are being constructed at Corfu and Brindisi for work on the Otranto Barrage.   The latter Station is already operating.Malta. Seaplanes are employed on anti-submarine patrolling and convoy work. During the last nine months British Aircraft in the Mediterranean have sighted over 30 submarines and attacked 20.Bizerta and Gibrcdtar. Kite Balloon units for use in Sloops and T.B.D.&apos;s escorting convoys are being established.Mgean. The work of this group comprises anti-submarine work, reconnaissance of the Dardanelles, distant bombing raids, crop burning and periodical reconnaissance of Constantinople, protection of naval bases from aerial attack, and spotting for bombarding ships. When the &quot; Goeben&quot; grounded at Nagara after her raid early this year, she was constantly harried by bombing, some 16 tons being dropped. In the summer of 1917, a Handley-Page aeroplane flew from London to Imbros and subsequently bombed Constantinople, carrying out many night raids until it was eventually lost owing to engine failure on a trip to Constantinople.Egypt.-Patrols and Convoy work are done by seaplanes and kite balloons from Port Said and Alexandria. One seaplane carrier is usually working on the left flank of the Palestine army, and another working in the Red Sea has proved a valuable support to friendly tribes, encouraging them in operations against the enemy.Zanzibar. A Squadron of Naval Aircraft assisted the Naval and Military forces in East Africa, and carried out much valuable work, spotting, bombing and reconnoitring. Voisin type of machines were used on land and transported many miles through the bush and operated with success.Bombing raids have been carried out by day and night on the docks, aerodromes and other important objectives on the Belgian coast with success. Since the blocking of Zeebrugge and Ostend great efforts have been made to harass the salvage and dredging work by bombing, and also to damage the concentration of T.B.D.&apos;s and submarines in Bruges.From April 1st, 1917, to April 30th, 1918, 232 raids on objectives in Belgium were carried out by day and night; 122 enemy machines were destroyed and 100 driven down out of control during this period.   A total of 5,625 offensive nights were made.Our losses have been considerable, for it is generally admitted that anti-aircraft fire in this area is intense and accurate. The losses by attack from enemy aircraft have been small.
[e) Anti-Submarine Operations in Home Waters.During the past year good progress has been made in the use of aircraft in anti-submarine operations, and a considerable degree of success has been achieved.The general method of employing aircraft now in vogue is : 1. Protection of traffic by kite balloons towed by surface escort, combined with a roving escort by small airships and an intensive patrol of war channels by aero-planes, seaplanes working further to seaward in co-operation with surface craft, and all available machines being disposed in relation to the expected movements of submarines as indicated by intelligence received.2. The creation of barrages composed of surface craft and aircraft to confine submarines within narrow waters ; and3. Attacks on submarine bases..Operations under the last two heads are only just beginning, but with the larger number of aircraft now arranged for and their greater range, it is hoped that considerable success may be achieved in the next few months.The requirements of the Navy to carry out this policy in its entirety, both as regards numbers and special types of aircraft, have been formulated and the additional air stations required are in course of preparation.Since April, 1917, the numbers of aircraft available have been largely increased; seaplanes are in existence which can carry heavy bombs and cover some 500 miles in eight hours, although to a large extent reliance has still to be placed on machines of an obsolete type. However good the general organisation and the type of machine may be, they must still be ineffective unless full and immediate intelligence is supplied to the officer responsible for anti-submarine measures, and he in turn can rely on experienced personnel with special naval training to carry out his orders. Some progress in this direction has been made by means of lectures given by specialists and by the circulation of pamphlets; an exhaustive course of training is being arranged. Local intelligence bases are being organised and these will be put in direct touch with the officers commanding the various groups, who are being placed in direct telephonic communication with the S.N.O.V responsible and Avith the various units under their command.Many attacks in the past failed on account of the small size of the bombs carried. This question has been closely studied, and, as a result, the size of bomb has been more than doubled and now some machines carry bombs which approximate in power to depth charges carried by surface craft.VI.--TRANSPORTATION OF PERSONNEL AND MATERIEL FOR OVERSEASEXPEDITIONS.A statement giving details under various headings of the men, etc., carried in Trans-ports on Military Service since 1st April, 1917, is set out below together with certain facts which illustrate the magnitude of the task which is being accomplished., The total number of men carried during the period since 1st April, 1917, is almost equal to half the total number carried since the beginning of the war.The reinforcements despatched from United Kingdom to France during the March-April German offensive were carried without any great increase in the number of ships used, although five fast railway boats were put into service for a short period. The same remark applies to the evacuation of the wounded.

Leygues, Minister of Marine, it has been decided to create a Naval Allied Council in order to ensure the closest touch and complete co-operation between the Allied Fleets.The task of the Council will be to watch over the general conduct of the naval war and to ensure the co-ordination of effort at sea as well as the development of all scientific operations connected with the conduct of the war. The Council will-make all the necessary recommendations to enable the Governments to make decisions. It will keep itself informed as to the execution of plans decided upon.The members of the Council will report to their respective Governments as may be necessary. The individual responsibility of the Chiefs of Staffs and of the Commander-in-Chief at sea towards their Governments as regards operations in hand, as well as the strategical and tactical disposition of the forces placed under their command, remains unchanged.It has been decided that the Council should consist of the Ministers of Marine of the nations represented and of the Chiefs of the &quot;Naval Staffs.
VIII.--ADMIRALTY CONTROLLERS DEPARTMENT.The Admiralty Controller is charged with the material side of the anti-submarine campaign.The supply of armament and warships for the Navy is entrusted to him, but his critical duty since May, 1917, when our losses were at their worst, has been to maintain our effective fleet of merchant ships for oversea supply.This includes a great deal more than merchant shipbuilding, as our gross output of merchant ships is only one factor in the problem of maintaining an adequate merchant fleet.The losses from submarines in the first half of 1917 were much too heavy to be met by building merchant ships, and the solution to the problem lay in the offensive and defensive against the submarine. Attack on the submarine and protection and r*epair of existing ships were given the first call oh our resources, while the building of new mer-chant ships, the supervision of which is now entrusted to a special Controller-General of Merchant Shipbuilding, receives only about a quarter of our shipyard effort, measured in man power.The anti-submarine campaign required new munitions and the creation of a new fleet of auxiliary vessels, which put a great and continuing tax upon the shipbuilding industry. These light craft hunt the Submarine, convoy and keep the sea in all weathers, and their need for repairs is constant and oppressive.The completions of anti-submarine craft, excluding Destroyers and Submarines, for four years are : Displacement Tons.1914 ..      ......Nil       ......Nil1915 ......      ..65       ..      .. 57,7711916 ........    98       ..      .. 99,6541917 ........   230       ..      ..        141,657This new fleet is still on the increase,&apos; the number of similar anti-submarine craft under construction being : In August, 1917        ............576,, May, 1918..............848The burden of repairs involved by this new fleet is shown by the fact that eleven times the number, but not of course the tonnage, of naval vessels were repaired and refitted during the last quarter of 1917, compared with the corresponding quarter of 1913 3,276 in the later against 295 in the former period.The Admiralty Controller took complete control of our repair facilities, and this control has very greatly increased the effectiveness of our existing ships.

The Council will meet as often as may be thought necessary under the presidency of the Minister of Marine of the country in which the meeting is held.The various Admiralties will furnish the Council with the information which is necessary for the work to be carried out.&quot;The Council was accordingly formed at once, and the First Meetings were held in London on January 24th and 25th, 1918, since when periodical Meetings have been held about once a month, in London, Paris or Rome, the latest Meetings having taken place in London on June 11th and 12th.

May     .............. 1,406,838A comparison of the periods ending March, 1917, and May, 1918, shows an increase of 103 per cent.The reconstruction of shipbuilding is a slow process in which effect lags far behind cause, but order and sequence have been gradually introduced into the yards, and the output will continue to rise.The gradual substitution of simple vessels for ships of more extravagant types is shown by the increased percentage borne by standard ships to the total tonnage under construction, namely: In June, 1917..........      15 per cent.In March, 1918        ........      50 per cent.At 31st May, 1918......      ..      60 per cent.Yards have been gradually relieved from unsuitable work, and employed on work for which they are best fitted.On the armament side of the Controllers Department almost all the new munitions were required for use against the submarine. The figures show the rapid increase in every important item.Bringing all guns to a common parity of cost, our completions of guns in the first quarter, of 1918 exceeded the completions for the first quarter of 1917 by 58 per cent., while several of our extensions have not yet come into bearing.4-inch Guns.

Additional pumping plant and other salvage appliances were provided for the different dockyards, and arrangements made for rendering first aid to damaged or wrecked vessels pending the arrival of skilled officers and salvage ships.This work was successfully carried out and gradually extended (two salvage vessels being fitted out by the Admiralty in May, 1916), until November, 1917, when the increasing marine casualties and the necessity for enlarging the scope of the Salvage Section became apparent.At the end of 1917 it was decided that the salvage of all vessels of the Mercantile Marine should be placed in the hands of the Admiralty Salvage Section with powers to render assistance to any vessel in distress of any nationality or charter.This involved a great expansion in all branches of the work, and further additions to the salvage plant became necessary. The Admiralty have now 10 fully equipped salvage ships in commission in Home Waters, all of which are continuously employed, and also two vessels fitting out, which are expected to be completed at the end of July.The portable pumping plant at the different bases consists of: 12-inch Oil motor driven pumps .. ..      ..      .. 3212-inch Steam driven pumps      .. ..      ..      .. 126-inch Oil motor driven pumps .. ...... 486-inch Steam driven pumps      .. ..      ..      .. 24-inch Steam driven pumps      .. ..      ..      .. 56-inch Submersible electric pumps ...... .124-inch Submersible electric pumps ..      ..      .. 43-inch Submersible electric pumps ..      ..      .. 24and 52 pumps in course of construction, all additional to the pumping plant carried in the Salvage Ships.At all dockyards and salvage bases there are ready for immediate dispatch a number of steam and. motor driven air compressors, portable electric lighting sets and a large quantity of salvage material.There are six completely equipped lifting vessels with a combined lifting capacity of&apos;7,200 tons, and a vessel weighing 2,750 tons in the wires has already been lifted from 11 fathoms besides a number of smaller craft.By arrangement with the Director of Ship Repairs, the Section performs all temporary repairs to vessels involving the use of pumps and divers, and delivers the ships to any repairing port notified by the D.S.R.The Salvage Plant in the Mediterranean also has been continuously employed, and the recent loss in those waters of two salvage ships has necessitated the despatch of two other vessels to replace them from Home Waters.The following are the numbers of ships salved since 1915October, 1915, to December, 1917 January, 1918 February, 1918 March, 1918 April, 1918 ..May, 1918Total ..260 14 41 37 36 19407
