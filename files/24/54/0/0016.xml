ot&apos;iinr I        SJ^*&apos; ^oc^ment is the Property of   fiJ1!G jffiatynlc jViajesty&apos;s Government.) / 4P1 F,      ^ o I        I have very carefully read Mr.Balfour&apos;s j&apos;//^&apos;WAI f^^morax^m of the 2nd May (June ?), &quot;Thoughts on German&apos; Colonies&quot;.    Inevitably the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs must have so much influence on peace negotiations, but I feel obliged to submit my observations upon them especially as I find myself in sharp disagreement with a part of his conclusions.I concur almost unreservedly in his first conclusion, tb,,t for the reasons which he gives &quot;it would be madness to restore any German colony to an unregenerate Germany&apos;1.    My only reservation would be as to the word &quot;unregenerate&quot;.    We have no particle of evidence that any body of opinion in Germany possessing the least political influence is.likely to be otherwise than &quot;unregenerate&quot; within any period to which his argument applies.    But perhaps the point need not be laboured, as the qualification disappears from his formal and final conclusion which is that &quot;no conquered colonies should be returned to the Germans which would supply them with either naval bases or a recruiting ground for native .leviesTo which I would add aerodromes.IThen I come to Mr.Balfour&apos;s second conclusion I find, difficulty in grasping his views as to the circumstances in which, the objects for which, or the Allies to whom, he would surrender the German Colonies in Africa.I gather that his arguments are conditioned on an &quot;indecisive termination&quot; of the war in which the &quot;balance of success&quot; may be &quot;on the Allied or on the German side&quot;.    In such an event I submit that we need not seriously discuss the fate of the German Colonies.An
An indecisive termination can only mean that Germany will then be in occupation of all, or the major part, of the territory      now hold by her in Prance and Belgium and that both sides have been exhausted.   If she had been forced back to her own frontiers it seems to me - looking to the military losses which she would have sustained before such a result had been achieved, and to her internal condition - that the termination would be decisive,    If on the contrary she retains what she calls her &quot;pledges&quot; in France and Belgium we may be certain that she will exploit these to the uttermost - even discovering fresh refinements of torture for the unhappy inhabitants - in order to blackmail the Allies into conceding her terms.    And these terms will undoubtedly include the return in full of the Colonies with which we are concerned.But in the contrary event, a decisive termina-tion whereby we need not pre-occupy ourselves with the German demandsJ infer that Mr.Balfour is still anxious to surrender the German Colonies in mid-Africa to &quot;anybody&quot;.-   I gather that his reason is that by so doing we shall strengthen our diplomatic position when we &quot;set ourselves to the task of establishing an Arab State, of defeating attacks on our naval position, and. re-arranging the map of Europe&quot;6    Who are going to oppose us in these matters?    Ex hypothesi not the enemy;   therefore it must be our Allies.  Which Allies are going e*g. to attack our naval position? and how shall we buy off the attack by surrendering a Colony to the attacker or to someone else?But Mr.Balfour seems to have a second line of thought:-   Belgium, France and Italy may not be ahle to satisfy all their aspirations in Europe;   therefore it is for us to offer them, out of our conquests, compensa tion in Africa.   For the reason already given I doubt
3f such a position can be reached;  but in any case I demur to what appears to be the underlying.arguments -viz. that we n* - responsible for satisfying these aspirations;   that we have eoaebow failed in our duty by failing to satisfy them;   jid that therefore we mugt provide them with conponsation,1 mist here point out a curious mistake in the memorandum.    Mr .Balf our says that the Powers will be impressed by the broad fact that &apos;-&apos;thc British Impire has acquired S/jejx ^man p6.sao^ipn whsther. in Africa or in the pacific south of tho Line&quot;.    It is true thab in an earlier passage) ho has alluded to the French hope of getting --half To go land,9 but nowhere does he mention the fact that they also occupy, and hope to retain, a portion of the Cameroon j -variously estimated at seven-eighths to nine-tenths of the whole;   in other words thoy will come to the Conference in possession of German African territory equal in ertsnt to about one and a half times that of the QoTiie.ii Enpiro.It really comes to this - that the territory whose fate Mr,3alfour is discussing conprises the western fringe of tho Gameroons, half Togoland, and German BastAfrica,    is regards the first two I am prepared to admitit , -7     j&quot;tha.tr ^UximosteiKies..might -arise which would-lead, ua to consider their surrender.   . But I submit that this quartion should only arise in connexion with territorial discussions and re-arrangements as between us and individua allies, and should have no place in a peace Conference. The really important matter is C-erman East Africa.This has been exhaustively discussed in preYious memoranda;   the Cabinet have bad before them the grounds on which the retention of this territory is considered to be of great importance to this country, and T do not propose to repeat them here.    But Mr,Balfcur, while elsewhere he recognises that Dominion sentiment must be raccorded
accorded full consideration, entirely omits to take it into account here.    Mot only India tat also South Africa lias incurred hoary expenditure o;* life and money in malntainijjg for over three years, at our request, the   ... struggle to secure this territory.  $hat will be the effect if they are told:-  &quot;it is true that are,have incited you to continually greater efforts in order to conquer GerrM East Africa.  You have at last &quot;been successful, and the ti&amp;e has xm come to tell you that we did this in order to hand over the territory to France, Italy and Belgium with She object of demonstrating our altruism to the world&quot;.I would add in this connexion that while there are people in this country who would support any proposal to restore the German Colonies and others vho - as I think, without any clear conception of rthat they mm - would favour their &quot;infcernation&amp;lis&amp;tion&quot;, I do not believe that there is anybody Which would not condemn a proposal to hand German East Africa, to my of the three Powers mentioned;  and I doubt if any Government would survive such a proposal.I should like to add a word as to lir. Bal our!a proposal as to a condominium.  Hot only do I believe it to be utterly unworkable in practice, but I regard it as the best of all possible methods of promoting future discord among the Allies and troubling the peace of the world. Mr. Balf our lias&apos; based the first part of his ^mcrandum on the assumption that a Oermay not $holly defeated will forthwith prepare for a future world-war.  I fully agree, but X also think that short of toe return to her oi her former Colonies nothing could better serve hor purpose than the proposed &quot;condominium&quot;.  This, I think, would be the case even if she srere formally excluded from it;  but Mr. Btlfour accepts thepossibility
possibility of Mi fdxml inclusion;, ^acl i:i that oaaa she \70uld have n&amp;gnifioent opportunities, of satting the Powers -by the ears, and I cannot doubt that she would s&amp;to full use of theauLastly I aust add that I cteyrec&amp;to the general tone of the rce/rioraraiunD in so far as it refers to the Dacinioji.3.    If we adapted the views expressed in it, it so&amp;os to mo that; m should go into the Conference tflth anattitude somewhat of this idr4,-        Great Britain, arei,altruists and desire nothing ior ourselves.  Bat our &quot;opinionsyare different.    They desire pertain things, and they met have their;. Is are sorry, but ;t?s nrost therefore obstruct any settlement which would otadh with their interests, thou$). ^e are perfectly willing to sacrifice interests that are purely British&quot;.    I should object to any such attitude on Wo grounds.   I dsscur altogether to any suggestion that, in the face of the world at large, we can draff any distinction between British and Imperial interests.  Before the world the British Hhspire, and its interests, should be one and indivisible.    Iirthe second place I should, on behalf of the Dominions * wuKaly resent airy appearance of a suggestion that their statess&amp;a stand fe a lower plain than those of this country or arc rcqre disposed to subordinate the general welfars of the Itopiro to  local interests.    Oil the contrary I hold that their views on those territorial causations are absolutely sound fron every point cf view, are cosg^lved in/ the nest interests of the Ifcpire as a whole, and afford an example uhioh we should do well to follow.It id 11 be seen that I ax. ivholly unable to endorse or to acquiesce in the line of policy tfu&amp;rseted in the second of Mr. Balfcur!3 conclusions,I have said nothing about the effect   &apos;upon theKative
Native Races generally of the policy we adopt in regard to the German Colonies:   news spreads rapidly from tribe to tribe, from North to South and East to West. T&amp;ey are all anxiously awaiting a decision which they know vitally affects their future:   we know that they ardently desire to be included in the British Empire: that they dread a return to German tyranny;   and I believe, they would regard a Condominium in which Germany was included as tantamount to the latter, and if Germany be excluded, &amp;a a failure on our part to assent ourselves and I cannot help thinking the effect would be wide-spread and disastrous.COLONIAL OFFICE.W.H.L. 11.6.18.
