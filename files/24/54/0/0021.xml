A farther increase in the ration of Egyptian cottonto &quot;be allocated to the United Kingdom during the current season has been sanctioned, the amount having been now increased to,500,000 bales.The Commission appointed in Bgypt to carry through the \, purchase of Egyptian cotton from August 1st next, has pre-pared a Scheme for distributing tag cotton.   This Scheme is now being oonsiderod in consultation with the $rineipal Associations in this country interested in the importation and use of Egyptian cotton.   The Commission proposes to grade the cotton into G5 typei aha samples of these types have already arrived in this country.      Prices for these types corresponding to the agreed basia price of fully good fair Sakellarides cotton have not yet been fixed, but two further, basis prices for fully good fair Brown Egyptian and fully good fair Upper Egyptian Cotton respectively pro-posed by the Commission have been accepted by the Official Values Committee of the Liverpool Cotton Association as fairly corresponding to those for Sakellarldea cotton.Arrangements have been settled with the War Office, sho have been in communication with in Cairo on the   P,subject, for the grant of licences to firms in this country to trade with the occupied part of Palestine,    or the present goods will only be allowed to proceed from the U. . to Palestine via Igypt and the licences will take the form of general licences to approved firms in this oountry to trade with approved firms in Palestine.   The amount of goods for which transport from Egypt to Palestine can be found will necessarily be restricted by military exigencies.The scope of the regulation which prohibits the sale to aliens except with the approval of the Board of Trade of oil properties of certain descriptions, of non-ferrous metal mining properties, and of shares and securities issued by Companies controlling such properties- has been extended.ran
j.The regulation as amended applies not only to the pro-perties and securities above indicated, but to all properties and shares in Companies operating in Scandinavia, Holland, Switzerland, Spain and Russia which are engaged in the manu-facture, treatment production or supply of any contraband article or of any article required or used for the manufacture, treatment or production of any such article.Further progress has been made in conjunction with the Ministries of Labour and Reconstruction, with the setting up of Trade Committees for reconstruction purposes in those trades which are not yet in a position to establish permanent Industrial Councils.    Meetings have been held in several trades at which these interim Committees, representative of employers1 and workpeoples1 associations, have been constituted,In accordance with     Chamberlain1 s proposals for the setting up of Inter-Allied Programme Committees to collate the Allies1 requirements of raw materials, food, etc. with a view to the equitable distribution of available supplies, steps have been taken, to set up Committees for timber, paper, cotton and tobacco and matches.On May 27th the Inter-Department Conference on RussianCommercial affairs which meets regularly at the Board ofTrade made the following recommendations:-(1) That immediate provision should be made for extended British official trade representation in the principal centres in Rursia during the present emergency on the lines of the proposals of the&apos;Sub-Committee which have already teen submitted to the Treasury by the foreign Office and Boerd of Trade.(2) That a Commercial Mission of experts be despatched as soon as possible to Russia to give authoritative advice to H.M. Government as to the best me ens of restoring and developing British trade relations with and interests in Russia and of countering enemy schemes of commercial penetration, and to assist H.M.Re resentative in Russia in giving executive effect to the policy of the Government for the above purposes, including the establishment and co-ordination of the work of the Commercial Intelligence Service referred to under (l).(d)(over

PUBLIC SERVICES ADMiffllSTMTIOK.On the 15th May I explained in the House of Commons the restrictions and conditions in regard to season tickets which I felt it necessary to impose.   As was to be expected my proposals have evoked a considerable volume of protests 1 and appeals directed more especially against the increase in the price of season tickets (10 per cent in the case of ticket covering distances up to twelve miles and 20 per cent in the case of tickets covering greater distances)&apos; and the provision that season tickets covering journeys of more than 12 miles should not be issued for a period of less than six months,I am appointing a Committee of which Mr. Honoratus Lloyd K.C. has accepted the Chairmanship, to review cases in which a Railway Company has not felt justified in issuing or re-newing a season ticket and &quot;specially hard cases will be enabled to obtain relief from the Committee.Early last year I ap,-ointed a Committee to consider and report what steps should be taken, whether by legislation or otherwise, : to ensure that there shall be an adequate and economical supply of electric power for all classes of con-sumers in the United Kingdom, particularly industries which depend upon  a cheap suoply of power for their development. That Committee&apos; has now made its Report, which has been presented to Parliament, ari I am considering what action shall be taken.on itI have held Conferonees with the High&apos;Commissioners for Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa at which was considered the Report-of a Committee appointed in October,/over
1917 to prepare a scheme for the Development and utilisationof the meat resources of the Empire after the War. TheReport was commended to the forthcoming Imperial War Conferenceas a basis for their deliberations on this natter.I have made a: rangements for all i^ort Labour Committees    DOHKfro deal with applications for exemption of tbs Dock Trans- !?0Biffl m , MILITABport Workers up to 51 years of age who are now liable for   SERVICEmilitary service. ,, MSOKtLANBOOSCOAL CONTROL,.     Recruitment of Miners.  Nearly the whole of the men to be recruited from the mines have now gone, the number up to the 5th June being estimated at 59,000.South Wales Strike. The recent strike in South Wales which commenced with the refusal of theman^genBnt,of the Tredegar Iron..  Jab&apos;;.,     -k] &apos; .   .and Coal Company to pay a quarterrs&apos;timq.,to .certain employees who had left their work in connection with a fatal accident, but which resolved itself into a question of discipline on which the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation decided against the men on strike, fin-ally involved about 48,000 men and was responsible for the loss of about 150,000 tons of coal.   The strike was settled on Friday, 31st May, on the understanding that the quarter day&apos;s wage was to be paid, and that the management should - prior to a resumption of work - meet the so-called &quot;Combine Committee&quot; which comprised representatives from pits other than the one at which the dispute arose, although in effect iinder the same management.
Mobility  Bureaus   The Miners&apos; Federation on 15th May decided not to go forward with the soheme to establish a Central Miners&apos; Mobility Bureau but to leave the question to the districts.  The question is of less importance now that there is no longer loss of time in the exporting dis-triots, but it is still desirable that the principle should be adopted with a view to securing the maximum output of the coals more particularly in demand for essential pur-poses, and the transfer of men from less productive to more productive seams.  Negotiations with the miners for a modified scheme are still pending.General advance in Wages.  There is good reason to believe that very shortly the Miners&apos; Federation will demand an increase in the War Wage en the ground that the cost of living has gone up since 30th September 1917,prices,  1 considerable increase in colliery prices will have to-be maSe shortly if the Coal Mines Control Agreement is to be self-supporting.The price of ooal in the London district was increased on 1st June by 1/6 per ton, which with l/- per ten correspond ing to the usual summer reduction not made this year makes a total increase tf 2/6 per ton.  This increase was necessary tt meet increases in merchants1 costs of distribution.RESTRICTED IMPORTS.The new scheme for private purchases in the United States took offset on May 15th and is to operate in respect of all goods purchased on private aocount, whatever the date of the order ana by whatever means the goods are consigned to this country.  Over 800 recommendations or &quot;permits14 have been communicated to the British War Mission.After consultation with the ether Departments con-cerned arrangements have been made fer the importation of
nuitdhta f*om Norway, oertain quantities of boots and shoes from U.S.A., a small amount of leather from Australia, and a reduced ration of coffee from East Africa.HOME OHOWNThe production suffers from inadquate labour, and )the position has been afijgravated by the recall to the Army of Sight hundred men belonging to Agricultural Labour Battalions in Scotland, who have been doing timber work by arrangement with the Board of Agricultufo .and Ministry of National Service.TOMCCO.There was an increase in the quantity of Tobacco imported during May, about 4,500 tons being entered by H.I. Customs as against 2,067 tons in April.   It is estimated that the clearances from Bond for Manufacture during the month will amount to slightly less than the average quantity of 6,500 tons.MATCHES.The output of certain brands of iiatches has recently been adversely affected again by a shortage of Pine Blocks, and the manufacture of these particular brands will entirely cease very shortly unless further stocks of these blocks arrive at once from America.   Representations have been made to the Minist of Shipping to allocate tonnage already sanctioned, and it is hoped that increased shipments will be arranged immediately.DYES.On the 15th May I nade a statement in the House of Commons briefly setting out the progress which had been made in establishing the dye iadustry ii this country and outlining the measures forxendering the further assistance which it isnow
now proposed to afford in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet in January last.    These comprise financial assistance for developing the manufacture of the special unremunerative dyes, the production of which cannot be undert taken as a commercial proposition without such financial assistance, the provision of grants for promoting research work, and arrangements for making special allowances for depreciation and obsolescence of plant etc. in approved cases.    At the same time I announced that the import of all dyestaffs would be controlled by a system of licences for a period of not loss than ten years after the war, and I re-ferred $0 the negotiations now in progress for the araalgama-tion of the two principal dye manufacturing concerns, British Dyes Ltd., and Levinstein Ltd.    These negotiations are pro-gressing satisfactorily but in order that the position may be fully- explained before the vote of the shareholders of the * respective companies is taken, it is proposed to hold a meeting of representatives of all sections of the colour using trades in  ianohester on the 14th June, at which I intend to give an-address explaining the whole scheme.The arrangements for supplying alizarine to France and India are now completed and consignments have been des-patched to both countries-    The supply of coal to the Swiss dye firms is also proceeding satisfactorily.ROAD TRANSPORT.w mm iwii **j  -liimiiw 1Power?. Regulation 2JJJ, of the Defence of the Beaim Regulations, has been issued giving the Road Transport Board the necessary powers to control road transport and an Order is now being drafted under this Regulation ^ich will enable the Board to proceed with the registration, of goods-carrying vehicles and the issue of permits.Emergency Measures.  After consultation with the homefe) /Over
Office, General Headquarters, i^oiae Forces, and the ^otor Volunteer Corps it has been agreed that the earmarking of vehicles for use in a national emergency shall be carried out by the Road Transport Board, thus avoiding the con-fusion and overlapping that is likely to arise if the earmarking is done independently by each of the inter-ested authorities.Transport Workers and military Service.   The Road Transport Board has had under consideration the problems arising from the calling-up of transport workers.    They have informed the National Service Department that while they realise the urgent need of men for the Army at the present moment they think it desirable that before further Orders are issued calling-up transport workers for military service the Board should be consulted as to which class of transport worker can best be spared.   The Rational Service Department has agreed to this principle and the Central Advisory Committee of the Board has drawn up a table grad-ing transport workers in order of ^dispensability according to age and medical category.  This table has been approved by the Board and forwarded to the ivational Service Department for their consideration.(10)
