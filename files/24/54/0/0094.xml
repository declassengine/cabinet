J 0     ..   ^0A1LIMMJP of tube makers,Adiairalty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.Th&amp; decision cf the War Cabinet to call up for Military Service by a ,:clean out&quot; all men of Grade 1 born in the years 1898 and 1899 (War Cabinet 431, Minute 5,) has created a situation in relation to the production of necessary Tubes, which it  is thought was not sufficiently approhonded when the decision was1- formede    The position is0 in the view of the Admiralty, so serious that it is considered essential to bring the facts clearly before the War Cabinet9 30 that it may be fully realised,The Admiralty has loyally followed the instruction &apos; of the War Cabinet to release for the Services from Admiralty CAB Firms a quota of 12*500 men.     In consultation and in agreement with the representatives of the National Service Department and the War Officea it decided to apply a &quot;clean cut3 to all men fc$ the ages of 19 and 20, with tho exception of those in certain occupations whose maximum output is essential to the performance of the Admiralty Programme, Of these occupations, Tuben:naMng tog one0    The following figure3 8how the resultBe lease of Men from feiiralty SAB FfrjjggL,Cards handed to Recruiting Officer e,, 12,,296Men posted from these carets 0,,   ....   4^203Cards of men not yet posted        ...   8,093Total number of men posted      ,....... 4*203Voluntary Enlistments in Army &amp; Air Force 3,311 Enlistments in Royal Navy as Engine RoomArtificers ...      128 Men in ReN*VaR0   Ye Soot ion enlisted andwaiting to be called up ... 1A1688,508Minimum estimated postings from 8,093cards of men not yet posted      ,,. 6a0Q0.314*508These aro men ascertained by medical examination to be of Grade I4 and when the cards are handed over and protec-tion is accordingly withdrawn, tho further proceedings as to posting are for the National Service Department to take.

With regard to the occupations wh$ch tho Admiralty excepted from Its &quot;clean out&quot;, the Cabinet Decision will now draw a certain number&apos; of recruits from them which will inoreaso considerably the numbers given up by Admiralty &quot;A&quot; Firms: so that the quota of 12,500 will be largely exceeded.     All of tho excepted occupations were regarded as of extreme importance; but the Admiralty desires at the present time to draw attention to the case of Tube production, because tho situation, in this case, Is much the most seriousoIn tho case of Tubes for Admiralty V/arships, it is explained that the margin of Tubes in hand lias fallen by one half since the latter part of 1916, and by one third during the last year.     Between December and January it dropped by 40.000 tubes; and while this decrease has been checked,   at the present time there is only one month1 s supply in hand.     This margin would, have been less, if the amount supplied for re-tubing of existing vessels had been maintained at the previous levelj   and it must be anticipated that any large repairs which might be needed in the near future would make a considerable inroad upon the already meagre stocks     At the present time the supply Is only barely meeting demandoIt is estimated that the application in Tube Works, of the &quot;clean out&quot; to men born in 1898 and 1899 will -have the result that the output cf Tubes for Tarship Boilers for new construction will be decreased by     ...    t.( 30 per cent. This would represent in each week a loss of 10,000 Tubes, or a larger number than would be required.for a destroyer. A &quot;clean cut&quot; of the men aged 21 to 23 would Involve a drop in production amounting to over 50 per cent.The work on which these men are for the most part employed is such as only men of vigour and good physique can perform, and the labour market would appear to be completely denuded of the type of men required.     The experience of two of the firms shows that out of 148 men engaged by them during this year, only 28 now remain.     Of the others, practically   all found the work too severe; very few of them having been able to stand thu . strain even for one month.If tho men concerned are withdrawn, it will be necessary, either to curtail the building programme, on to take stokers from the Fleet and send them to the Tube Works.The Aeroplane Programme would also be involved In difficulty.     It has to be kept In view that the demand forTubes/
Tubes for Aeroplanes is a rapidly increasing quantity.    The specified requirements of the Air Ministry for the next few months are as follows;:-  .MAY      ........ 2,000,000 ftJUNK     ........ 2,250,000 ftJULY......... 2,500,000 ftAUGUST ........ 5,000,000 ft.SEPTEMBER....... 5,250,000 ft.It is regarded as quite impossible to provide these rapidly increasing quantities , if the staff of men of the ages mentioned is entirely removed.The number of men of the ages of 19 and 20 remainingin Steel Tube firms at the present time is ......610and of the ages 21 to 23 -   ...        ...        .... 1368.So that the maximum number of men that the Army could obtain by this &quot;clean cut&quot; would be 2.000 in all. 230 men of the ages in question have already been released, and the agreement up till now with the National Service Department has been to leave it in the hands of the Admiralty officer controlling the Tube firms to effect the release of men as he found it practicable.      The firms have been diluting their labour with women employees, where the work is of a character which can.be done by women.The firms mailing Brass and..Copper Tubes are treated by the Schedule of Protected Occupations as in the same &apos;. category as those making Steel Tubes, and their conditions are similar,     The number of men in the Tube Departments of the Brass and Copper firms of the ages of 19 and 20 is      105,and of the ages of 21 to 23 i3 394,so that approximately 500 men are there affected.     .115 have already been released from these firms.     If the men that remain of the ages of 19 and 20 are taken, it is estimated that a decrease of 17 per cent, will take place in the output&apos;, and if, in addition, those of 21 to 23 are taken, it is estimated that the decrease will be 34 per cent.   If these results follow, the supply of Condenser Tubes to new Warships and Merchant Vessels, and to vessels requiring repair, cannot be kept up.   .In the view of the Admiralty, it is necessary that the situation should be reconsidered by the Cabinet in the light of these new facts.(Sgd)   R.
