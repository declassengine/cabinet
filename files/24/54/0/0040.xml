Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.\^   c    Report for the week ended 11th June, 1918.Income Tax,A leaflet explaining the new income tax proposals as affecting farmers has &quot;been issued after consult-ation with the Inland Revenue.    25,000 copies have been printed and the majority have already been distributed in response to letters^ which havs been received from individual farmers and others. In accordance with the pledge given in the Honae of Commons during the debate on the Budget Re solutions,the Financial Secretary of the Treasury read the leaflet oefore issue and expressed the opinion that it was clear and would serve- a useful purpose.Land Division.Small Holding Colonies.ffatringtoh.    The farming operations for the week included ploughing and&quot;cultivating fallows by steam tractors and motor tractors, horse hoeing mangolds, drilling rcct seeds, and hand hoeing all crops.    Practically all the crops on the farm have now been hoed once, and, where necessary, the soccnd heeing is being dene.    The weather, has been dry and warm.      The wheat crope have improved considerably, and are new, if anything, too strong.Holbeach.    The horses are still busy amongst the potatoes horse-hoeing and earthing up the earliest crops, also carting for the builders.    The settlers are continuing to work satisfactorily.Heath Hill.    The potato planting on the Colony is now completed, 65 acres altogether having been planted, and are, on the whole, coming up well.    The women&apos;s hostel now contains 7 workers who appear to be working satisfactorily.    The cattle on the Colony are doing well and two in-calf heifers have been purchased with a view to supplying the necessary milk to the hostel when it is occupied to its fullest capacity.   . Five store pigs have also been purchased with a view to using up the refuse from the kitchen at thd hostel.Kelham Estate.    Arrangements have been in progress for theproduction of &quot;commercial&quot; and &quot;Kcther&quot; seed, and it has been .decided that the 18 acres already planted at Kelham with varieties of French, Russian   and German origin shall be ear-marked for the production of &quot;Mother&quot; seed.   An arrangement fcas been made with Messrs Sutton &amp; Sons of Reading that their expert should visit Kelhara in November to make a selection of the roots:   arrangements will also be made later for securing a chemist to&apos;make the analysis of the selected roots for sugar-content, and the roots finally selected by the analyst will be planted on the estate in 1919 for the production of &quot;mother&quot; seed.      Fifteen acres of the three varieties (five acres each) will bo sown at Kelham in July for the production of &quot;commercial&quot; seed and in order to ensure a good plant, it has been decided to make one or two sowings at fortnightly intervals:   the plants raised for &quot;commercial&quot; seed will be   transplanted in 1919 on to 110 acres at Kelham to produce seed in the autumn of 1919 for the 1920 crop. The farming operations are taking their normal course.
It has now been found from retting trials that the water supply available at the site for the Peterborough Factory is suitable for this process, and it has therefore been decided to proceed with the new factory as early as possible so that the deseeding portion will be ready in time to deal with the crop in that area.    The scheme for building on the Bunford site, Yeovil, is well in hand including the railway-siding.     The arrangements for the Harvesting Camps are almost complete.     In addition to the provision of a certain number of vehicles contracted for through the Office of Works for the transport of labour and the crop, the Road Transport Board&apos; has been approached by the Board with a view to their supplying the additional requirements at each oentre.     The War Office have also promised all available assistance.Tithe^,, Copyhold, Commons and Survey Branch.Among the applications received during the past week were six for Altered Apportionment, six for. Merger, one for Redemption of Tithe Rentcharge, one for Redemption of Rentc]iarge under the Conveyancing and Law of Propetty Act, 1881, and two for the Enfranchisement of Copyhold Land;   while one Altered Apportionment, five Mergers and five Redemptions of Tithe Rentcharge and three Enfranohisements of Copyhold Land were oonfirmad.fe^lA^SalJ^x^qOoo^The present endeavour of the County Executive Committees to comply with the demands of the War Cabinet for recruits from agriculture, has intensified the grave feeling of anxiety amongst farmers as to their ability to maintain their farms and harvest their crops.    The Joint Committee have received strong representations as to the urgent importance of the Government carrying into immediate effect the proposals for providing assistance. There is no doubt that the difficulty of making suitable substitution is accentuated by the natural conservatism of many farmers, particularly in isolated districts, and it may be necessary to institute persuasion of a more definite characterand also to make arrangements for housing the labour provided in many of the more inaccessible districts, where, owing to lack of cottages, single men living in farmhouses form the larger part of the agricultural labour. In these districts many of the young men are tempted to leave the farm for employment in felling and preparing timber, for which very extraordinary wages are being paid;   it is urged that for suoh work German prisoners might be used, releasing the skilled&apos; farm worker for* hiB ordinary employment.Pis Production, Section.Inquiries for literature as to Pig Clubs and pig feeding are numerous.    A considerable percentage of the correspondence relates to the difficulties in obtaining feeding stuffs and from these letters ana communications with the Ministry of Food it is evident that the position is most unsatisfactory.    Difficulties have also arisen in respect to the Ministry of Munitions arranging for the supply of standard sties and material for the construction of sties.    Apparently the Ministry have difficulty in obtaining material from the Timber Controller.Ordnance. Survey.laying the week ending 12th June 1918, 73,612 maps were . .sent to Prance, 59,369 to the Admiralty, 6,754 to&apos;the War Office, and 12,896 to the Air Ministry.     5 relief models were sent to Prance.
Publications Branch.Thfl number of applications for ordinary issues of the Leaflets was 1,362, in response to which 4,409 copies of Leaflets Were despatched.     In addition, 38,650 copies of Leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.    A further supply of 15,000 was sent to the Government Information Bureaux for distribution as explained in previous weekly reports. During the week flood Production Leaflets No. 45 (Skim Milk Cheese) and No, 46 (The Seeding of&quot; Concentrated Food to Dairy Cows on Pasture! were published, together with a ;   rewritten edition of Food Production Leaflet ITo* 14 (The Rearing of Calves in the Summer and Autumn of 1918), copies being distributed to 11,000, 10,000 and 10,000 persons respectively on the Leaflet List.Pi jghftr,i.e.g,. DjvijsiyOn *frdml n i s t r a t % ye., S o c t i on.The new abstraction of water soheme under the Lancaster Corporation Bill is under consideration *      A case of suspected salmon disease has occured en the Wye and a fish has been received for examination and the matter will be carefully watched. Information has been afforded the Australian Commonwealth Offices in the matter of supplies and price of cod liver oil.      Various cases of pollution of Rivers in the Ouse, Tyne and Trent Districts have been dealt with.     Questions   have also arisen in connection with fishing harbour accommodation at Scarborough, Bridlington, North Sunderland and North Wales.pit Section,      39 Permits have been issued and 25 cancelled.    A report has been received from Lowestoft and transmitted to the Admiralty of the sinking of three Lowestoft smacks by gunfire from an enemy submarine.lot&quot;or Loan Committee .    The Committee have installations in progress at &quot;more than twelve different ports while others are awaiting a visit from their mechanics.     One of the mechanics has been installing engines at Hastings and a very gratifying report has been received -to the effect that his presence there has been very greatly appreciated by the fishermen generally for whom in his spare time he has been able to do many small running adjustments etc.     They have asked whether the Committee could not arrange for this man to be stationed at the port as District Mechanic and it has been pointed out that his presence would undoubtedly lead ao a big increase in the catches of fish owing to the more regular and better running of the engines.     A system of District Mechanics in charge of Districts in which there are a number of motor boats has bean one of the Committee&apos;s schemes, but it has been impossible to arrange owing to the number cf different ports at which engines have to be installed and the entire lack of local facilities.      The need for these District Mechanics has, however, been clearly demonstrated at Padstow where there are four large vessels with semi-Diesel engines, and the Committee have been obliged to obtain the services of a competent engineer to take charge of the Fleet.feghermen and Naval Service.     A suggestion that men in F.125 should be required to present themselves for medical examination with a view to enrolment in Section &quot;Y&quot; was discussed by the Department of the Director of Naval Recruiting and 5,R. Section, and was negatived. The Section understands that the Department referred to is now in a position to improve and facilitate the arrangements for enrolment cf fisherman in F.125 by the adequate provision of forms and armlets at places at which these were&quot;lacking previously.     The Department of the K.O.A.P. enquired whether the Beard would prefer boys reaching the. age of 18, and at present under contract F .124 should be
enrolled in Seotion &quot;Y&quot; or straightway in Section        of the R.1T..R. It was agreed that they should &quot;be enrolled in the former Unit and the assistance of the Board was promised in securing this enrolment.    Instructions have oeen given to Grims&quot;by on the matter, and will &quot;be repeated to the other ports.The normal work of the Board proceeds on lines as&quot; indicated in previous Reports.Secretary.14th June , 1916.
