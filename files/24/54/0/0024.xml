BATTLE SITUATION - NOON - 13TH JUNE, 1918.

---------------

1. Between ANTHEUIL and the OISE fighting continues, the French have recaptured the village of MELICOCQ, and advanced their line to the southern outskirts of MAREST-SUR-MATZ. The French now hold the southern bank of the MATZ from MAREST-SUR-MATZ to the OISE. As a result of this operation and a minor operation in the neighbourhood of COURCELLES the French have captured more than 100 prisoners.

Between the AISNE and LONGPONT heavy fighting has taken place and the Germans have captured the villages of COEUVRES and ST. PIERRE-AIGLE.

Our line in this neighbourhood appears to run as follows:-

west of LONGPONT, west of VERTEFEUILLE FARM, CHAFOSSE, west of ST. PIERRE-AIGLE, west of Coeuvres, thence along the western side of the LAVERSINE RAVINE through ST. BANDRY and AMBLENY.

It is reported that the attacks in this area have now been stopped.

The French consider that all the German Crown Prince&apos;s reserves have now been engaged.
