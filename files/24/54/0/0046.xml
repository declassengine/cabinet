Report relating to the War Work of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland for the week ending 12th June 1918.I.   FOOD PRODUCTION.The weather during the week has generally been dry and the temperatura has- been much lower than in recent weeks.   Rain is much wanted in many districts although thunder showers have fallen with beneficial results in certain areas.Grain and potato orops oontinue to look well. Hay, though by no neans a poor crop, does not promise quite so well as it did 10 days ago.1.   Compulsory Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M.Under Seotion (1) (U) the Board have issued an order requiring the occupier of Pitoroy Shootings and Hill Grazings in Morayshlre to give a return first as to the area of Pitcroy Moor and the number and class of live stock at present thereon, -and second as to the locality and area of each of the Hill Grazings in his possession in Morayshire, together with the number and class of live stock thereon.The Board have also issued an Order taking possession of a portion of the Deer Forest of Coigaafeam,-Inverness-shiro, -with a view to arranging for the grazing forfthe area in question.   The proposed tenants are smallholders and others in tho district.2*   Golf Courses.During the past two seasons many Golf Clubs in the country have given up portions and in some oases the whole of their courses for cultivation or grazing.    The Board consider it essential, however, that a still greater area of such land should be utilised for food production purposes during 1919. They have accordingly asked the District Agricultural Executive Committees to give special attention to the possibility of cultivating or adapting for grazing Golf Courses, Public Parks and other recreation grounds in their respective areas.    The Board have suggested that representatives of each Club or Public Park ComLttoe should be invited to prepare and submit to the Concalttee a soheme for the utilisation of their recrea-;tion grounds and that the Committee should forward a return to the Board of all golf courses and recreation grounds in their area, reporting particularly,-(1)   the view of the Committee of the possibility ordesirability of all or a portion of the ground being (a) cropped, fb) grazed;(2) the proposals of the Club or other interested parties for the utilisation of the land, with the Committee^ observations thereon;(3)   aav special difficulties that are anticipated, e.g. ex6es3ive rent, probability of large claims for loss, damage, restitution, etc;r
(4)   the definite recommendations of the Committee having in view the points raised in (1), (2) and (3).The Board have further circularised every Ooif Club in the country pointing out the necessity for increasing the araotmt of food to be grown in Scotland next year and asking their oo-opera-:tion in $eourlng this object.3.   Labour. - Employment of Old Ago Pensioners.The Board have brought to the notice of District Agricultural Executive Coramitteca a concession recently made by the Treasury with reference te tfce earnings of old age pensioners.under the general scheme of administrative oonoessions, pensioners in urban districts are allowed to earn wages up to 30/- per week without forfeiting their pensions, but in rural districts, until recently, the limit was 20/-.   As this limit had the effect of diminishing the incentive to pensioners to take part in agricultural work to the full extent of which they were capable, representations were made to the Treasury, who have now agreed to abolish the distinction.   Pensioners living in any district are now therefore free to earn wages up to 30/- per week without forfeiting their pensions.4,   Grain Crop 1918. - Supply of Sacks.-In the Spring of this year farmers and merchants in the North of Scotland experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining sacks for the conveyance of seed grain.    Sacks used for this purpose are supplied for the most part by the Highland Railway Company but for a variety of roasons the Company were unable to meet promptly all the orders reoeived by them during the pest season. It would seem that the suspension of the usual ooastal steamer services has thrown an additional volume of grain traffio on the railway with a corresponding increase in the demand for sacks. The Company have added considerably to their pre-war stocks but their efforts in this respect have been neutralised to some extent by the failure of merchants and dealers to make similar provision.   The existing congestion on the railways has also tended to limit the use of the available supply.   Consignments of grain like other articles are often held up for longer periods than formerly and the number of times the sacks can be used during the season has therefore been reduced.The complaints received from other districts were comparative-:ly few, but in view of the greatly increased area under grain in the present year it was imperative that the position should be investigated.   A circular letter was therefore addressed to the five Scottish Railway Companies enclosing a list showing by Counties the estimated additional acreage under grain and enquir-:ing what provision had been made far handling the anticipated additional grain traffio on the railways.    Following the issue of the letter the Board conferred with representatives of the North British and Caledonian Railway Companies and obtained from them particulars of the additional quantities of saoks ordered and of tbe speoial steps that are to be taken to clear grain traffio during the busiest season in the Spring of 1919,   It is proposed to issue appeals to Sack Hirers and Corn Merchants to assist the Railway Companies by ordering additional quantities of /
of sacks. Farmers will also be asked to make such arrangements for the despatch of grain as will obviate tlie retention of sacks for a longer period than is absolutely necessary.IX.   KBOHPrPING IE AGRICULTURE,1.   The number of men actually posted towards the quota of 5.500 men up to 11th June was 2,300.2*   In the case of men aged from 23 to 31 who were plaoed in grade x before 28th May, the period for receiving applioa-;tions for exemption has been extended from 6th instant to 16th instant, by arrangement with the Ministry of National Service,(Scottish Region).
