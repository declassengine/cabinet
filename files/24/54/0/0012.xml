Cl ^1^^ &quot; the Proper^^^,Jjis^Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Govern . .   *ft CAB/A,/5\*\\ BRITISH  ECONOMIC   RELATIONS   WITH   RUSSIA.^^^^\7e desire to &quot;bring to the attention of the War Cabinet the appended recommendations made by an Interdepartmental Conference meeting at the Board of Trade and containing representatives of the Board of Trade, Foreign Office, Treasury, and Department of Overseas Trade   (Development &amp; Intelligence). This Conference, which so farhas been informal in character, arose out cf the necessity for providing some means of co-ordinating the action of the various Departments and sub-Departments with regard to Russia affairs in matters within the economic sphere.       The absence of proper correlation in this matter-has proved very inconvenient in the past * and may have been partly responsible for the very limited measure of success so far achieved.The recommendations of the Conference have received the approval of the Departments concerned, and action is now being taken in pursuance of them.In particular, the Commercial Mission referred to under (2) has been selected, and the members have alrwady started for Russia in company with Mr. Lindley, who is returning, with his staff, as His Majesty&apos;s Principal Representative in Russia under the title of Commissioner.The Commercial Mission is for the time being in charge of Sir William Clark,   Comptroller-General of the Department of Overseas Trade   (Development   &amp;   Intelligence),and
and the other members are Mr.H.A.Armitstead (of the Hudson Bay Company  who has -or most of his life been engaged in trade in Russia). Mr. Leslie Urquhart (whose great practical acquaintance with the mineral resources of Russia is well known), and Mr. F. Lambert (of Messrs. James Wiehaw &amp; Co.).Attached to the Commercial MiatIon      Mr. D. Spring Rice (who is specially entrusted with inquiries as to the popition of the Treasury in relation to the transaction already entered into for controlling certain Russian Banks), and Mr. W. Peters, of the Department of Overseas Trade-;, who acts as Secretary.Ir, addition a representative of a group of British Banking and Financial Houses is about to viBit Russia to explore the possibility of banking developments in Russia. He will not be a member of the official Commercial Mission, but he will act in close touch with them.We may add that the project of a Commercial Mission to Russia is not new, having been authorised some months ago on Lord Milne^s recommendation.      There have however been great difficulties in getting the Mission established arising out of the constantly changing political, economic and military conditions.For the purpose of making the work of the Commercial Mission effective, it is essential that there should be proper co-ordination at this end, in order to ensure that the Mission1e recommendations may be adequately considered and the necessary action taken without delay. For this purpose steps have been taken to carry outrecommendation
recommendation No. (3).    In addition to all the Departments enumerated in the recommendation, it has been thought well to invite the War Office (and they have consented) to nominate a representative, in view of the intimate correction-between military and economic policy in Russia.While it is impossible in the present state of business disorganisation in Russia and the prevailing uncertainty with regard to Russian developments and our own relations with Russia to be very sanguine as to the immediate results to be expected from the steps now being taken, we have felt that it would be indefensible to omit any action which presented any reasonable possibility of increasing our very scanty knowledge of the real economic situation and prospects in Russia and of assisting in countering the schemes of enemy commercial penetration which the Germans are evidently pushing with the assistance of such leaders of finance and industry as Gwinner, Ballin, and Rathenau.We bring the matter at this stage before the v/ar Cabinet for their information and in order if possible to obtain a general assurance of their support in giving effect to any well considered and reasonable measures which may be recommended by the organization we are now setting up.ROBERT CECIL. June 11th, 1918. &apos; A.H.STAMT.
