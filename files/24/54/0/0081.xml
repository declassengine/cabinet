Copy of letter from Sir W, Graham Greene to Sir Edward Iroup.Ministry of Munitions, Whitehall Place, &apos; S.W.June 14th, 1918,With reference to my letter of June 5th, in view of Colonel Wilsons letter to you of May 31st, forwarded with your letter to me of June 1st, and arising out of the Oallfway Handicap at Cardiff, I have made some further enquiries as to the general position of the Ministry with regard to the holding of these &quot;flapping&quot; races.The main concern of the Ministry is whether or not they Interfere with the output of munitions.   If they do not interfere with the output, we do not pro^ hibit them.It is also, of course, necessary to consider the holding of these &quot;flapping&quot; races from the point of view of transport facilities and food.   As regards the former, the races with which we are concerned as a rule involve no railway  travelling at all, and so far as oats are affected, the Ministry have a working arrangement with the Oats Rationing Committee..Generally speaking, in so far as innocent amusements do not interfere with munitions work and in the absence of very good praotioal reasons the view here is that It is unwise to stop such races, sinoe labour unrest arises frequently among the work people from insufficient means of recreation, as well as from material causes.
