(itomorandtm by tho Ministry of Shipping)Blockade pressure on tho Northern iloutrals coupled with tho requisitioning of a lairgo proportion of tho Dutch Mercantile Marine has mado tho control which tho Allies possess over tho omployment of neutral tonnage practically oomplote.    Either by tho right to havo vessels oh timo-oharter or by tho right of approving their voyages or, as in the casd of the Sweditfh Agroe-mailt, by specifying tho routes and if necessary the cargo to whioh preference is to be givon, we can secure that neutral tonnage is employed in the way best calculated to 3orve war neoda.tfrora the point of view of a world control of tonnage, however, one factor is at present missing.    We havo no effective control over the employment of certain Alliod tonnage trading mainly in or from the East.    War conditions havs powerfully stimulated the development of the Japanese Mercantile Marine, and this has been used mainly to expand Japanese Mercantile trade outside the War Zone and with no regard to tho prosecution of the war.One result has boon that the Japanese shipping interests have since the outbreak of war either by establishment of entirely new services or expansion of existing ones, encroached upon or dosign to enoroaoh upon long established British interests which have boon weakened by the withdrawal of British tonnage for vital war purposes.If tho trades in question were ossential to the Allies and oould only be maintained by the introduction of Japaneso tonnago wo might bo content to regard the aacrifioe of permanent British interests as part.of the inevitable prioe we have to pay for the &apos;War, thougl^ven so it would ill acoord with equality of scwrritLco that whilst British tonnage is all liable to employment in the War Zone and consequently subjected to heavy losses wbioh will have a serious post-war reaction, Japanese tonnage should enjoy a corresponding immunity outside the War Zone.In relation to Allied noeds, however, these Japanese dovelop-ments are mainly 3uporfluous and involve, theroforo, a soorifioe of the oomraon interest and a waste of tonnage at a time when the tonnage position may well prove to be a determining factor.Repeated appeals have boon mado to the Japanese Government to place tonnage at the disposal of the Allies but no disposition  -whatsoever has been shown to meet these appeals.    The refusal has been unconditional, the only reason given for this unresponsive attitude being that Japan requires all her national tonnage to serve her own essential needs.It is a significant commentary on this pica that of the new services mentioned in the accompanying schedule, only one involves oemmunioation with any Japaneso port.As a matter of fact her polioy has been patently to use the stimulus of war conditions for the expansion of her ^Mercantile Marine and Maritime trade
From another point of view also the freedom from control of Japanese tonnage in the East may well prove very embarrassing to Great Britain. We have urged upon the United States the desirability of using the strong position in which they are placed to control effectively freight rates in their own trades. They have established a system under which rates outside the War Zone are less attractive than rates within. They have at times expressed misgiving that their policy may involve the unnecessary sacrifice of their own interests owing to the possibility of tonnage withdrawing from their trade and securing more attractive employment in uncontrolled Eastern trades.

In order, therefore, to put a stop to this waste of tonnage and the supplanting of British interests during their pre-occupation with Allied needs, it is suggested that the control which the British Empire can exercise over exports from and imports into the various ports of the Empire, should be used to prevent the establishment under a foreign flag of any new service, or the development of any such existing service beyond its pre-war dimensions.

To this end, it is submitted that the Governments of India and the Dominions, as well as those of the Eastern Colonies, should adopt a system of licensing exports which would restrict the carriage of goods to vessels :

(a) Running for the account of or under charter to one or other of the Allied Governments.

(b) Running in regular services as established before the war.

and that exceptionally licences should only be granted when the tonnage falling within those? two categories is insufficient to meet the vital needs of the exporting country, and then only in respect of vessels operated by existing Services.

Any tonnage employed in excess of this criterion is detrimental to the prosecution of the war, to the financial interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government in tonnage employed by them outside the War Zone and constitutes a grave menace to the re-establishment of British shipping after the war.

q i niExtract from &quot;JAPAH CHRONICLE&quot; dated 1st May, 1916..JAPANESE VE333LS FOB FRANCE.In shipping circles in Kobe it is rumoured that the French Government has approached the Japanese Government with a request for a supply of vessels, hut this is denied in shipping circles in Jokyo.   It is stated that no such thing as a French request for Japanese vessels came up for consideration at the recent meeting of the Shipping Control Council.   It is reported that some time ago the Japanese Government was approached by the French Government with a request for a supply of Japanese vessels.   The Japanese authorities entertained the request, but arranged to offer Japanese tonnage for the transport of goods in the interests of Prance in the shape of opening new Japanese shipping services abroad.   It is stated that it was in accordance with this arrangement that the Osaka Shesen Kaisha recently opened new services to Marseilles and the South Seas.   The &quot;ASAHI&quot; states that there is reason to believe that though the Government is prohibiting the sale or charter of Japanese vessels to foreigners, the authorities are considering some new proposals for the offer of Japanese vessels in the form ef inaugurating new Japanese services abroad.   Our Japanese contemporary says that even if France asks Japan to offer vessels, it will be impossible under present circumstances for Japan to accede to the request, and the authorities are not to be expected for the time bein;?, to take up for con-sideration any proposal for the offer of Japanese vessels except by way of opening new Japanese steamship services abroad.
