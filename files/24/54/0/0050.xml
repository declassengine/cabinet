[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] 18332Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1918.SECRET.6.&apos; -^MNAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 55.Week ended 8th June, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Mines have been laid in tbe Heligoland Bight, off the Belgian Coast, and in tbe North Sea. northern approaches to the Dover Straits.Many reconnaissances and patrols have been carried out in various areas by R.A.F. machines employed on naval duty.&apos; On 4th June, five large America seaplanes from Yarmouth, while carrying, out a reconnaissance off Terschelling Island, engaged 10 enemy fighter seaplanes, two of which they shot down. On the return journey two of our machines were forced to alight close to the Dutch coast owing to engine trouble, and have been interned. The remaining three machines returned to Yarmouth safely.On 6th June one of our large seaplanes on patrol was chased by five hostile aircraft but managed to shake off her pursuers. She, however, sustained slight damage during the chase and was forced to come down, and in doing so was badly damaged. The crew were picked up by another of our seaplanes.On 7th June one of our aeroplanes from Yarmouth, on anti-submarine patrol, when 5 miles S.E. of Cross Sands, was attacked by five enemy seaplanes. As our machine was armed with bombs only, it was forced to manoeuvre with a view to eluding the enemy fire, and in this it was successful. The enemy, however, then observed one of our seaplanes which they attacked in force, ultimately driving it down to the water, where it alighted beside two motor launches. The latter opened fire but did not succeed in driving off the enemy machines. The British seaplane was eventually sunk by machine gunfire from the enemy machines, the pilot and observer, who were both slightly wounded, being rescued bv the motor launches.Machines from Dunkirk have, in addition, made the following raidsApproximateFlanders area.Date.June 2nd3rd4th    .. 4th-5th 5th    ...5th-6th6th .. 6th-7thObjective.weight of bombs dropped.Results observed or remarks.Ostend Docks     ...............Zeebrugge ..................Bruges Docks     ...............Ostend     ...     ...............Zeebrugge ..................n &apos;&quot;        *VBruges Docks, Zeebrugge and Thourout Rail-way Junction.Zeebrugge Lock Gates, Bruges Docks, Ghistelles and Marialter aerodromes, etc.Zeebrugge ..................St. Denis Westrem and Oostacker aerodromes, and Bruges Docks.Tons.III i2 12 1 221-3!11One direct hit on base of Mole.Fires started at Bruges Docksand Marialter aerodrome. 2 direct hits on Mole.

During the night of 5th-0th June our aerodromes at Dunkirk were heavily bombed by about 25 enemy aircraft, some 300 bombs being dropped. Two hangars were destroyed and several damaged. Four of our machines were wrecked and a number damaged, most of them slightly.  The casualties were 2 killed and 9 wounded.On the following night about 30 enemy machines, including Giants and Gothas, again attacked our aerodromes at Dunkirk, and dropped 100 heavy bombs ranging from 100 to 500 kilos, and 150 small bombs. Four hangars were completely wrecked and others damaged, and a number of machines were destroyed. The casualties were 3 killed and one wounded.  Both machines and personnel have been replaced.In aerial fighting during the week two enemy machines were destroyed and four driven down out of control.   One of our machines is missing.Atlantic. H.M. trawler &quot;St. John&quot; while following astern of a convoy off the north coast ofIreland was attacked by a submarine and sunk by gunfire, 14 men being killed. The skipper and two men were taken on board the submarine.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines During.the week under review it is estimated that from 4 to 7 large enemy submarines operating, have been operating, only one of these being of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type, which has been operating of! the American coast at the entrance to Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Other large boats have been located in the western entrance to the English Channel. While the number of large submarines at sea this week has been markedly small, - there has, apparently, been a concentration of effort on the part of the smaller enemy vessels off the East Coast of England.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemywith enemy submarines which are reported to have taken place during recent weeks, and the nature submarines. 0f the craft which have been engaged, and also the number of submarines which have been destroyed as the result of such actions or which have been interned :-	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		May 18th.

The percentage of losses to sailings in these Overseas trades in the week under review is only &quot;40 as against 3&apos;21, in Cross-Channel trades is &quot;49 as against &quot;28, and in Coasting trades is &quot;08 as against *10, while as regards all United Kingdom trades the percentage is &quot;33 as against 1*36 in the previous week.The Table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign as well as British, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine, classified according toIt will be seen that the enemy activity in the English Channel again shows a marked reduction, but for the first time it has been necessary to add the American coast to the Table as a new area, 17 attacks having been made in that area during the week, resulting in the sinking of 12 and damage to 5 other vessels.The number of British and Foreign Merchant Vessels sailing in organised convoy, Vessels which have completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in convoyed such convoys, compared with corresponding figures for previous periods are as follows :-Areas in which vessels lost.

ENEMY MINES.Minelaying activity on the part of the enemy lias this week been experienced in the Minelaying. approach to the River Forth, off Cromer, and also in the Havre area where 16 mines were swept up or destroyed during the week. The mines which were laid off Cromer were found almost within the course of the ships which are employed in the repatriation of prisoners. The sweeping up of mines in the enemy&apos;s barrage which was laid some 30 miles from the Aberdeenshire coast has proceeded, 85 mines in this barrage having so far been destroyed, two of them having been cut during the week under review by the Paravanes of a Light Cruiser Squadron. Mines from the old fields at Colombo and Bombay are still being found.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters (including the Havre and Cherbourg areas) in recent weeks: Week Ended.

There is also a considerable amount of tonnage still being transferred from Neutral Flags, and but for the losses by marine risk, which have been unusually heavy for this season of the year-nearly 20,000 tons more than in April the net gain for the month would have been more considerable.The net gain or loss in the total tonnage of the British Mercantile Marine in recent months is shown below: 1917.November December1918.

No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.
FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.The Dreadnought battleships &quot; Petropavlovsk&quot; and &quot; Sevastopol&quot; have been damaged by fire at Kronstadt, and the latter is reported to be out of action. The pro-German party in the ships of the Baltic Fleet is growing stronger and is urging the immediate sale of the Fleet.It lias been decided to evacuate all small craft at Kronstadt to the Caspian Sea via the Volga. This would mean reducing their draft to 5^ feet in order to get through the canals.With a view to saving Government property in the event of enemy occupation the control of the port of Petrograd has been handed over to General Yermakoff, who is the head of the &quot; Committee of Industry and Trade.&quot;A transport with 1,400 troops on board is reported to have left Constanza for Batum on June 8th.The Russian S.N.O. at Murmansk has informed his Government that he considers it advisable that Americans should be brought to Murmansk in order to counteract a too strong growth of British influence. Trotsky has telegraphed to the Russian S.N.O. Murmansk, forbidding him to allow Russian destroyers to be manned by British or French crews.France.In order to meet the menace caused by the seizure by the enemy of Russian war vessels in the Black Sea, the French Squadron in the Northern iEgean has been reinforced from Corfu, by three pre-Dreadnought battleships of the &quot; Danton&quot; type, seven modern destroyers, a flotilla of 10 submarines and a minelayer.Spain.The Spanish Government has taken effective measures to prevent the escape of the German submarines recently interned in their ports.A Royal Decree was promulgated on May 31st dealing with Government control of. the Spanish Mercantile Fleet. This decree gives the Government powers to detail vessels for particular routes and services, etc., and fixes standard freights, and compels shipowners under heavy penalties to provide the vessels demanded of them by the Commissioner of Supply. It also provides that shipowners shall share in any losses which may be caused by the reduction of freights.Naval Staff,lMh June, 19)8.[Appendices.
