Confidential.I.-STRIKES.Statistics of Strikes in the Week ending the Mh June.&quot;During the week ending the 5th June, 27,880 working days or nearly one-fifth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on Ministry of Munitions work. The most serious loss of time occurred at the Cumberland iron ore mines, where 6,000 men lost two clays each, and at the works of the Ebbw Yale Steel, Iron and Coal Co., Ltd. (Newport), where 4,000 workers lost three clays each.Statistics of Strikes in May.The following table shows for the month of May the number of persons involved in strikes in each district, the total number of days lost, and the average duration of the strikes : 1 ^ijhitnf	Number of Work-	Number of Days	Average DurationIJIStl Hi.	people involved.	lost.	of Strike.London and South Eastern -	1,520	1,470	1-0South Western  -      -      -      -	406	212	0-5West Midlands  -      -      -      -	5,145	20,397	4-0Yorkshire and East Midlands	815	&apos;   1,362	1-7North Western -	8,069	15,437	1-9Northern   -	556	1,062	1-8Wales       -      -	4,981	18,342	3-7Scotland.....	102	474	4-6	21,624	58,756	2-7The average duration of strikes in May has thus been nearly three days, as compared with less than two days in April, when 8,212 workers lost 15,409 days.

IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES. I j^gYoS Jgj (12th June 1918.)^HALLjb^J ----I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.
Causes of Strikes in May.Out of 42 stoppages during the month, 27 were occasioned by disputes as to wages-including demands for an advance or for the 12! Per C(3n^. bonus, questions of piecework, the terms of arbitration aAvards, and methods of payment. &quot;Five stoppages were due to dismissals, three to grievances against superintendents and foremen, and four to the employment of aliens, non-unionists or diluted labour. In one case men refused to work overtime on account of the heat, and in one case to go on a dangerous scaffolding. The remaining strike lasted only a few hours, and the cause of it Avas not knoAvn.IL-MUNITION WORKERS AND THE ARMY.When the neAV Schedule of Protected Occupations came into force at the beginning of February, the quota Avhich it was hoped to secure by the end of June from munitions Ministry of Munitions, War Office and Admiralty was fixed at 108,000. In the first week after the German spring offensive began in March, the number of releases rose to double the average for the previous weeks. This higher rate was Avell maintained for some weeks, and produced in due course a corresponding increase in the number of men . posted to the Army, which increased from 2,000 to 5,000 a week. The instructions given at the end of April for a greater stringency in calling up men born in the years 1895 to 1899 alarmed many of the firms engaged on important output, and greatly increased the number of appeals by employers against the calling up of their young men. The result unfortunately has been that the rate of releases and the corresponding number of postings have diminished in recent Aveeks, and it iioav appears improbable that the quota of men due to be released by the Ministry of Munitions will be posted to the Army by the time fixed. Tire total number of men released up to the 1st June was 97,200, of aarhom 12,500 are claimed by the Admiralty. The total number of men posted up to the 1st June from Admiralty, War Office, and munitions firms aaras about 67,000. In addition about 5,000 soldiers have been retured to the colours.III.-DISTRIBUTION  OF  SKILLED  LABOUR.To regulate the fknv of labour from one factory to another is an urgent need of the situation. The Ministry are now applying more Avidely the method of embargoes under ^Defence of the Realm Regulation 8a (b), and are issuing a considerable number of letters to individual firms forbidding them to engage additional labour without licence. In some cases this step has been taken in order to enforce dilution; in others, because the high Avages or attractive conditions of employment tended to attract an undue proportion of skilled Avorkmen.The extension of the War Munition Volunteer scheme will operate in the same direction. A aarorkman who is enrolled as a War Munition Volunteer can be assigned to the firm where he is employed, or, if he is surplus or substitutable, can be required to remove to other work where his qualifications will be more fully used in the national interest. The neAV feature of the scheme is the pressure Avhich is to be brought to bear upon Avorkmen who are surplus or replaceable to make themselves available for transfer by enrolling. The sanction is the provision in the Schedule of Protected Occupations Avhich provides for the Avithdrawal of protection from men who are substitutable.The new scheme was submitted to the Trade Union Advisory Committee of the Ministry on the 5th and 6th June, who after much anxious discussion and criticism, finally passed a resolution appealing to all members of their unions to enrol at once. If a Avorkman of military age Avho has been asked, in accordance with the scheme, to make himself available for transfer to other or more urgent Avork by enrolling as a War Munition Volunteer is reluctant to enrol, he has a right of appeal to an Enlist-ment Complaints Sub-Committee, on Avhich labour is fully represented. If this committee decides that he ought to enrol and he still refuses, his name will be reported to the Ministry of Munitions in order that the Department may consider whether sufficient justification exists for continuing his. protection from military service. The Trade Union Advisory Committee have been asked to appoint a central sub-committee to advise the Ministry of Munitions on all cases so reported to them
before the Department decide whether protection from military service should he withdrawn.It is hoped that one effect of the new policy, when it has had time to operate, will he to exercise a steadying influence on wages throughout the country.IV.-AN EXPERIMENT IN SHORTENING HOURS.In spite of the fear that a shorter normal week may lead merely to an increase of overtime and therefore to a higher wages hill, the experiment of a 50-hour week is being attempted in several national factories. The shorter week makes it possible to work on the one-break system and to diminish the loss of time which is inevitably caused by stopping and resuming work. Up to the present, the only factory in which the experiment has had an adequate opportunity of justifying itself is the National Shell &quot;Factory at Worldngton, where it has been in operation for three months. It is reported by the manager that time-keeping lias improved and that the workers are satisfied with the alteration in hours and have no desire to return to an early morning start.V.-COST OP BUILDING.The work of the Ministry in housing munition workers has necessarily caused close attention to be given to the increase in the cost of building. This increase over pre-war standards has been very great. Precise figures can be quoted only with reservations, for building costs vary according to locality, and to the facilities for obtaining materials and labour. Subject to these considerations, it may be said that a workman&apos;s cottage, which before the war cost 285Z. to erect, now costs 575/. Both the cost of labour on construction and the cost of materials have doubled, and, in the case of materials, half the increase is due to the advanced cost of labour entering into their manufacture.
