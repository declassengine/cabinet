(THIS JOCM 13 TH3 PROPERTY Off HIS BRIT AM IC JiAJBSWS flOTSiRNMSMT)33SCREig* .....*&apos;&quot; *-S.T.4900.POSTWAR PRIORITIES OCMaWWS,. (Be G.T.4819).Memorandum by General Smuts.I agree in the main with Dr. Addiaon*s re^^omoendations-.-But I consider it advisable that the Po t-%r Priorities Committee, while working under the same Chairmanship and the same -Secretariat as the War Priorities and maintaining the closest relations to and co-operation with it, should in other respects be a distinct and separate Committee for the present. Their functions will begin to merge as the end of the war Is apnroached, but at present are quite distinct and in some respects antagonisticI would re-command that the Post-War Priorities Committee with the personnel mentioned by Dr, Addison be appointed, but that the Controller of Shipping be added to it^ as the shortage of tonnage after &apos;the war will demand oven more priority con-slderaiJion -than that of materials,$hers is some urgency in appointing this Committee as Dr. Addison is under the impression that his work is being delayed for want of the necessary machinery to prepare the : way for post-war arrangements.The Economic Defensive Committee appears also to be generally in favour of Dr. Addison^ suggestions.(Initialled) *J. 0. 3.Z miitehall Cardans, S.t,r. 21st June, 1918.
