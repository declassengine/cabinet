it&quot;The Administration of the Bureau should be &quot;controlled by a Governing Body representing &quot;the various parts of the Empire, as well aa &quot;the mineral mining and metal industries. This &quot;Body should be responsible for the appointment &quot;of a Director or such other official or &quot;officials as may be considered desirable and &quot;the necessary subordinate staff within the &quot;limits of the funds available for administrative &quot;expenses ,&quot;   (Paragraph 10,)The Committee further suggested that the esponses of raalntonance of the Bureau (being a sum not exceeding for tho first years of existence  10,000 per annum) should, for the time being, be voted by tEe Imperial Parliament, on the advice of the Minister of Reconstruction, although tho view was held by some of the Committee that from the outsot direct contributions to the maintenance of the Bureau should be borne by all the Governments concerned,(6)  As regards Administration, It is suggested that the Bureau should be placed under the supervision of the Lord President &quot;of the Council on lines similar to those adopted with regard to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, a Committee of the Privy Council and the governing Body constituting the Bureau,    This constitution and the duties of the Bureau should be defined by an Order in Council, which would also establish the Governing Body^ with the Lord President of the Council as President, and the Minister of Reconstruction (or such other responsible Minister as may \.  from time to time be found suitable) as Vice President,The Order in Council would also charge the Governing Body with the duties above defined,(7)  As to Finance, it Is suggested that, in so far as thefunctions of the Bur ecu   consist in collecting, concentrating and disseminating what may be called second-hand information, of which other Departments or agencies are the original sources j and in advising the Departments or Governments concerned as to what further information is neodod, and how it should bo obtained, the view put forward in paragraph 25 of the Report of Sir 3, Stevenson!s Committee is sound viz, that by maintaining their own institutions, which were working in closest touch with the Bureau, by appointing their own representatives, to the Governing Body? and, it should be added, by carrying out the researches recommended by the Bureau, the Oversea 7  Govornmentswill contribute their share of the expenses, and that the general administrative expenditure should be borne by His Majesty^ Government.   In so far as it should prove a function of the Department to institute special enquiries or to carry out researches on its own account, it would clearly tie right that a proportion of the expenses should be borne by the Dominion and other Governments, in whose general interests the research is&apos; made.  This should be arranged by establishing, under Charter, as in the case of the Deportment of Scientific and Industrial Research, an Imperial Trust to hold and deal with moneys which would be contributed for these purposes.   The Governing Body would no doubt be able to determine the amount which,should be asked for from each Government for such purposes,     &apos; ,
&apos; Aa to expenditure it ft auggostod that a distinction should &quot;be drawn between current aicMrtiarfcratdv^ expenditure and the coat of special enquiries instituted by the Bureau on iti own account, at tho wish of air/, of the Ckwertaa^t^,As to current expenditure of each Government, a Government should of course pay t$e expenses of Ha own representative. The general expenditure&apos; Should, it is suggested, be paid for in the first instance out of moneys provided by the Imperial Parliament; and. arrangements ore being made (as suggested in paragraph 23 of Sir J* Stevenson1 s Report) for the provision of a sum of  10,000 by the Imperial Bxche*ruer for t&amp;e purpose Of starting the Bureau *  Arrangements should &apos; be mfide. however, whereby at the close of each financial yeaxv the cost should be divided in an equitable manner\ and re-covered from each of the Governments represented on the Governing Body.(8)  The Governing Body will be established on the lines laid down by Sir J\ Stevens on !s Committee, the Chairman of the Governing Body advising the Minister.(9)   Power should therefore be taken in the fcrder in Council to establish an Imperial flruat under Charter to hold and deal with moneys which would be placed at their disposal by way of grants In aid contributed by the Imperial and oversea Governments *(signed) CERXSTOPTO ADCISON.6*6 *18 *

At its meeting in London on the 23rd April last the Imperial War Conference passed the following Resolution:- ..-&apos;- &quot;That it is desirable to establish in London an Imperial Mineral Resources ; Bureau j upon/which should be represented Great Britain, the Dominions^ India, and other parts of the Empire. -&quot;The Bureau should be charged with the duties of collection of in forma-.tion from the appropriate Departments of the Governments concerned and other sources regarding the mineral resources and the metal requirements of the Empire, and of advising from time to time what action, if any, may appear desirable to enable such resources to be developed and made available to meet the metal requirements of the Empire.V That the Conference recommends that His Majesty&apos;s Government should, while having due regard to existing institutions, take immediate action for the purpose of establishing such a Bureau, and should as soon as possible submit a scheme for the consideration of the other Governments summoned to the Conference/&apos; -        - - r- 2.

In considering the scope of the information to be collected, and the advice to be given by the Bureau, we have noted that the use of the phrase &quot; metal require-ments &quot; immediately:following the words &quot;mineral resources &quot; suggests that it may have been the intention of the Imperial War Conference that the new organisation should confine its operations to metalliferous ores. :We are, however, of opinion that a Mineral Resources Bureau must deal with all. mineral products that are used for industrial purposes, if it is. to meet the requirements of the case. It is not possible to; draw, a hard-and-fast line between metalliferous ores and minerals which are .required,in connection with;such ores or for other purposes,, , .o  (33)5J37   Wt (J^i53-3J   100  6/13   K &amp; S A &apos;1IMPERIAL MINERAL RESOURCES BUREAU COMMITTEE.
4. We consider it desirable at the Outset to examine the existing agencies for collecting information as to mineral resources and metal requirements and for advising on development questions in connection therewith.5. Existing Institutions for Collecting Information.-The principal institutions existing for the purposes indicated in the Resolution of the Imperial Wa* Conference are described in the Appendix to the Report. In general terms it maj be stated that throughout the Empire information as to mineral resources and production is collected by the Geological Surveys, and by the Mines Departments, which latter compel the licencees of the mineral areas under their control to furnish returns of output. The information obtained from these sources is, as a rule, published in reports issued annually by the Surveys or Departments and is also included, in summarised form, in the reports of the Government- Statistician, /where such exists. The official machinery described above usually applies only to local resources and production.b\ The Geological Survey of Great Britain and Museum of Practical Geology, in addition to preparing special reports on the mineral resources of Great Britain, exhibits mineral products from all parts of the world, with the special object of illustrating their application to industrial purposes.v Information of a scientific character js also given and inquiries answered upon economic subjects connected with geology, such, as the resources of . ores and minerals. A library of 30,000. books relating to general and applied geology for all parts of the world and a complete set of geological maps are maintained at the headquarters of the Survey for public reference. A summary of the work of the Survey will be found in the Appendix, pp. 24-25.. .&apos; . &apos;     ..7. With regard to the work of the Imperial Institute, which is summarised on pp. 25-2si of the Appendix, the Committee recognise that the Institute occupies an exceptional^ position- since it is constituted&apos; by Act of Parliament on an Imperial-basis. Its Executive Council includes representatives appointed by the Governments of this country, the Dominions, India, and the Colonies, who also contribute to its funds. The mineral resources of the Empire embrace a definite section of its work. The Institute periodically publishes monographs on the occurrence, composition, and uses of minerals of economic importance, of which about 30 have been published since 1904. It also deals with inquiries on these subjects received in this country or from overseas. It maintains for public use Reference Collections of minerals of economic importance, and investigates in its laboratories and through its special export staff minerals received from all parts of the Empire, with a view; to their commercial utilisation. -    , &apos;  ,.8.. The work of the Imperial Institute on minerals is carried on with the advice of&apos; a representative Committee on Mineral Resources.   The Institute works in co-operation with the.Mines and.other Departments overseas, and also with the.Board of Trade and Other Government Departments in this country, as well as with the Chambers of Commerce and with the representatives of the Dominions in this country.:9. The Committee recognise the value of the work which the Institute is carrying on for the. mineral.resources.of the Empire, and consider it expedient that this work should be utilised in. connection with the operations/of the Bureau so long as the work is carried on to the satisfaction of the Governing Body [see para. 19 et seq.).10; The Imperial Institute has, however, only been incidentally concerned with the metal production and requirements of the Empire, or with technical aspects-of these subjects.&apos; It has moreover not-been in a position to-advise generally on the developments which are called for in the interests of the metal requirements of the Empire, which will be one of the most important duties of the Bureau.   ........11, So far as the Committee are aware, information as to the metal requirements ofthe-Empire has not hitherto been -collected to any appreciable extent, nor was there -any organisation in this country/by -which an estimate of such requirements : could, be made until.the war brought about a shortage of certain materials and attention. was -consequently directed to the importance of this matter. An estimate-of requirements *was obtained from Government and commercial consumers,.and, to that extent,- and under War Legislation, certain mineral and metal requirements have been ascertained.
As to&apos; the1 consumption&apos; of (minerals: throughout the Empire,, statistics with regard to; coal and iron!are&apos;made by. the Board .of Trade, but the great majority of estimates a,s () to consumption.are.contained in ;the unofficial publications of industrial concerns.. It shpuld i be one of the earliest duties of the Bureau to devise more satisfactory means of gauging: the metal requirements of the Empire.) 12. Existing Institutions insufficient.-It will be seen from the-foregoing that the.$Listing institution^:whose duty to some extent it has been to collect information as to: mineral resources; and mineral and metal requirements have no central organisa-tipn:;.to. which such information can be sent and co-ordinated for universal use throughout the Empire in accordance with the purposes which the Imperial War Conference had in view, and that there is need for such an organisation to compile&apos; and furnish all.existing information of a statistical character.13. For the task of advising the Governments of. the. Empire what action may, appear desirable to enable their mineral resources to be developed and made avail-able to :meet. the ;Empire&apos;s needs, both military and commercial, we feel that; the time: has come for. the . establishment of a more, specialised prganisation than at present exists,;! Whatever organisation may be adopted . must,, -however,, .j our, view, be.such as will meet with the approval of all parts of the Empire and secure their- hearty co-operation.. The success of the.scheme also largely depends upon the interests that.comprise the mineral and mining industries and metal trades deeming it oue suitable.to their requirements,       - ,       ...... .14. Duties of the Bureau. As the Resolution indicates, the Imperial Mineral Resources -Bureau will have two main, functions : - ;&apos;; ;  (i) The collection of information (i.e., an Intelligence Service) and;. &apos; ;, ;., - (ii) To advise upon the development of resources (i.e.\ an Advisory Body)&apos;. - ;&apos;&quot;\7.&quot; The Committee suggest ihat.it ,wi]l. be the duty pf the intelligence Servicefpf the new. organisation;.(a);, to mate. systematic and regular use pf all -available channels of information, official and unofficial.; (b) to ascertain, their precise, scope ;,[c)i\to suggest means whereby they can. be improved, particularly in regard to the publication of reports at inore frequent intervals and on .a more comprehensive and uniform basis ; - (d) to establish or suggest&apos; the establishment of any new machinery for., the collection of information not now collected which may.be required for the purposes of the Bureau, and-(e) ultimately to-adjust any-unnecessary overlapping of functions which may.now exist. - .  -     -     -     -     -     -     -      -    . -15. As-to (e), however,- we think -that ..the first efforts, of the Bureau should be directed mainly to organising- the Intelligence Service. on sound dines, so as to enable it to collect within the shortest possible time complete and accurate information on all matters within-its purview. To this end and in order., to build up records quickly, the Bureau, after, first determining, the general principles and arrangement of its records -and ;of their publication, should proceed for the -time being as the coordinator, on these principles, of the information collected by others rather than endeavour to obtain it by direct inquiries. Every agency now engaged in co-ordinating statistical or other particulars of mineral resources or in assisting in -their-development should, for the. present, be. utilised...to this end-the Bureau, in suitable cases, - supporting applications; for financial assistance, for:the- purpose. It should be understood,, however, that the.;extent of the utilisation-of..any; existing agency must be entirely a/matter-for the/Governing^ Body to determine. .  ; j. :.    ;dC; The-Bureau;.should-also-have powers to do whatever is necessary to enable -inquirers to obtainan up-toolate statement,, in concise form,.-, showing not .only the /production and - requirements within the ,-Empire, :but also -throughput; -&quot;jjip world;1 country: by -country, -of every, mineral. and metal: known to industry.o^or ; example, particulars as&apos;:&apos;to smelting or: refining capacity,..[and.facilities existing; .for rendering inineral prodUcts;suitable for commercial uses, the; value of. the-production within each country, the market, price of the inineral or metal, and the ^selling, agencies
21lAppomtment and Qualifications of Members; and their duties.-The members of the ^Governing Body who are to be Imperial representatives should, we suggest, be appointed by tlie Governments which they represent. under such conditions of remuneration and duration of membership as seems-appropriate, to the latter.   The members representing the mineral and mining and metal industries should logically be1 &quot;appointed tinder similar conditions, but for want of a more perfect system of trade Organisation than at present-exists (and consequently of a suitable electing body), we -think that it would be desirable;that these four members should be nominated by the &quot;Imperial, -Government after- consultation with . the; existing associations / directly &quot;interested in those industries,I The term of office of: the four Industrial Representatives would be for one year, but each member would be eligible for re-appointment.   We do not suppose: that they - would wish to receive&apos; &quot;payment: fox.: their services on the &apos; Governing Body..: The &quot;Chairman of the Governing Body-should^ we are agreed, bein the markets of the world, should be compiled. It should also, have records q &apos; tlie mining laws and fiscal tariffs prevailing in each country, and of labour and-transport conditions in each mineral or mining area. We-tjrw^tjaiilicm tft, the necessity for the new organisation, while concerning itself primarily with Imperial resources and requirements, collecting similar information. with ^regard to foreign countries, as, without such particulars, it appears.to us that the Bureau:cannot present ah accurate statement of the case from an Imperial point of view.        . ;.&apos;, - .... fj]17. With regard to the advisory functions proposed for the Bureau, these would! be exercised by the Governing Body. They would principally, consist in examining and&apos;f presenting to&apos; the Governments concerned, for executive action, if the latter approved, any scheme for the development of Mineral Resources which was referred to them by competent authority, or which they themselves initiated as a result of their enquiries and investigations. In view of the representative character of the Governing Body, much weight would doubtless attach to their considered advice on any question of policy within the terms of their reference. -    &apos;        : &apos;. ;, &apos; - .&quot;       . - , , ;18. Necessity for Commercial Support of New Organisation.-Numerous memorials have from time to time been forwarded to Government Departments by; private concerns interested in the mining, and metal industries, and by Associations connected therewith, indicating what would be regarded as acceptable machinery for performing some of the duties prescribed for the Bureau. In all cases knowledge of and co-operation with the industry- on the part of the Governing Body of any organisation is insisted on. In framing the scheme set out herein due attention has been paid to this suggestion.19. The Scheme: Organisation of the Bureau: Governing Body and Directorate. Wetherefore propose that the Bureau should be set up, and that, as it is the commercial community which would make most frequent use of the Bureau, its office should be in a part of London convenient to the interests, concerned. The Administration of the.-Bureau.should be&apos;:controlled by a Governing Body representing the various parts ofthe Empire, as well as the mineral, mining, and metal industries. This body should be responsible for the appointment of a Li rector or such other official or officials as may be considered desirable,-and the necessary subordinate staff; within the limits of the funds available for administrative expenses.: 20. Constitution of the Governing Body.-We consider that the Governing Body,should be kept as small-as is compatible with adequate representation of the interests concerned.   This could be achieved by the appointment of members as follows : United Kingdom -     -     - -     - :   -     - . . - , 1Canada       -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -    .-     1f yj. :-.

The quali^atipijSi;Q^the, Industrial Representatives would be.such,as met with the approval of the,,representative associations consulted before their appointment. , J lV ....23. FmanpftMCPaiUWntary Gpntrpl.T?We estimate that the expenses of maintenance of the Bureau for the fp;st,.years, pi its existence would not exceed 10,000Z. per annum. It is suggested that this-siim- should for the time being be voted by the Imperial Parliament, although-jljhe vi&apos;e\V is&quot;;held Jpy some of us that from the outset direct contributions to the maintenance of, the,,.Bureau should be borne by all the Govern-ments concerned. Another VreAris tliat;&apos;by maintaining their own institutions, which will work in the closes^toAeh^withlt^Bjjreau, and by appointing their representatives to the Governing Body, the.Overseas,Governments will thereby contribute their share of its expenses. In any&quot; ^ase^wV&apos; think1 that it should be left to the next Imperial Conference to det^i^Hi^^heJii^ Jujt*ml$ery the charge shall be apportioned amongst the constituent parts oi, the.,.,Empire, and, if so, on what basis and subject to what conditions contributions shall be-levied! in order to secure to the Bureau the fixed minimum income itfd&amp;SHH^fri&amp;BML itf work. Had a Ministry of Mines been in existence, the Committee w,o.uld. have proposed that the contribution made by the Imperial Parliament should&apos;Mve *bee:ri bbrne on the vote of that Department. -But, under present conditions, we suggest that the moneys votedt :by, the Imperial Parlia-raent should be accounted for by the Minister of Reconstruction, and, if contributions *are also voted by Overseas Parliaments, the sums grantedbyeaoh^should be accounted for by the Minister designated by each of them for the purpose. In addition to making a report of its work, at least annually, to the Minister in this country responsible to Parliament for the Bureau, the Governing Body shall also make its report to each of the other Governments concerned. - ^;- -&apos;24. Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations. 1   :(1) That a new organisation should be set up and be known as the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau. &apos; - .(2) That its offices should be in a part of London convenient to the,interests concerned.(3) That the administration of the Bureau should be controlled by a Governing Body representative Of the Governments of the Empire and also of the commercial interests directly concerned -in the mineral, mining, and metal industries trade co-operation being essential to the success of the Bureau (paras. 18-22); ; :&apos;(4) That it should be financed by the Imperial Parliament in the first instance. If it be decided at the next Imperial Conference that the Governments of the Dominions, India, and of the Other parts of the Empire should contribute to the expenses of the Bureau, the proportions of such contributions might be determined at that Conference, regard being had to the importance of the new organisation being in receipt of an assured minimum income (para. 23).(5) That the following should be the duties of the Bureau :   .(a) To collect, co-ordinate, and disseminate information as to resources, pro-duction, treatment, consumption and requirements of. every mineral and metal of economic value. \(b) To ascertain the scope of the existing agencies with a view ultimately toavoid any unnecessary overlapping that may prevail.;;    (c) To devise means whereby the existing agencies can, if necessary, be K:&apos;*-\&apos;,- assisted and improved in the accomplishment of their respective tasks;    ,
-8*. (cl) To supplement those agencies, if necessary, in order to&apos;obtain any information noli:&apos;   ;;; not now cbllected&apos; which may be required for the purposes of the Bureau,  .(e) To advise on the development of the mineral resources of the Empire or of -,       .   particular parts thereof, in order that such; resources may be made available .1 \      for the purposes.of Imperial defence or industry. :   J   :&apos; 1&quot;,&apos;   \ ,&apos;    ...Win July 1917.. .:; \ $f;&apos;//;&apos; /&apos; 1 ;; ; 7/!       &apos;f tyw&quot; . -::&apos;-&apos;:--&apos;&apos;!..&apos;- [&apos;    &apos;   J. stevenson,&apos;: -.; .,A.

IMPERIAL MINERAL RESOURCES BUREAU COMMITTEE.Appendix to the Report.Statement of the existing organisations for collecting information as to the Mineral Resources and Production throughout the Empire and in the leading commercial foreign countries of the world.The particulars have been obtained in response to a questionnaire inviting (i) an account of the organisations existing for the collection of information as to (a) mineral resources, and (A) metal require-meuts ; (ii) whether such organisations collect similar information in respect of other countries ; (iii) the methods and means of collecting the information ; (iv) how such information is made available, and (v) the constitution and cost of maintenance of the organisations.In regard to the Empire, the information and particulars have, in general, been drawn from official sources, and in many instances have been checked by officials of the Departments mentioned and the Dominions concerned.The notes on the organisations in Foreign Countries are largely based of necessity on pre-war conditions. They were originally circulated amongst members of the Committee as a temporary measure pending the receipt of statements compiled from particulars to be collected through the Foreign Office. These particulars are not yet available, and the notes as originally submitted to the Committee are consequently included in this Appendix.UNITED KINGDOM.The organisations existing in the United Kingdom for collecting information as to Mineral Resources and Production are :-(1) The Geological Survey and Museum of Practical Geology ; (2) the Board of Trade ; (3) Home Office (a) Mining Statistics Branch and (b) Mines and Quarries Department; (4) Colonial Office ; and (5) Imperial Institute.l. The Geological Survey and Museum of Practical Geology.-The normal workincludes :-(a) a detailed geological survey of the country and the preparation of a geological map on the scale of 6 inches to the mile ; (b) the preparation therefrom of geological maps on the scale of 1 inch to the mile and smaller scales ; (c) the preparation of explanatory and statististical memoirs descriptive of the eheets of the 1-inch map, and of more general memoirs dealing with districts or subjects of special economic or scientific importance; (d) periodical revision of the maps and memoirs ; (e) the examination of and advising upon boreholes made in search of concealed coalfields, iron ores, waters, &amp;c.; (/) conserving and exhibiting in the Museum rocks and fossils as the evidence on which the geological maps are founded ; and (g) the preparation of special reports upon the Mineral Resources of Great Britain.For the purpose of these special reports all the places in Britain where the raw material is or has been worked, or is likely to occur in payable quantity, are examined by members of the staff of the Survey. Characteristic specimens of the materials are obtained from all notable localities for chemical and physical examination and for exhibition in the Museum. Tbe activities of the field staff of the Geological Survey of Great Britain are limited to this country, except in respect of the work detailed on page 24 of this Appendix, in which a full statement of the constitution and scope of the Geological Survey and Museum appears. *2. Board Of Trade. Statistics prepared by the Board of Trade are directed specially towards indicating the consumption of Metal.The information (i) as regards the United Kingdom is collected by means of the Statutory Returns required to be made to the Home Office under the Coal and Metalliferous Mines and Quarries Acts and by voluntary returns obtained from Trade Associations, mine and quarry owners, manufacturers, &amp;c. ; (ii) as regards other countries, directly from the Government of the country concerned, or from its officia1 publications, through H.M. Consuls, and in other ways.Figures as to production are obtained from the Mines and Quarries Department of the Home Office, and the same publications as are received from abroad by that latter Department. The Board of Trade figures under this category relate mainly to coal, iron ore, and pig iron.The Board of Trade also obtains, under the Census of Production Act, 1906, particulars of the quantity and value of the output of Coal, Metalliferons aud other mines and of works engaged in the smelting of metals ; of the numbers employed at such mines and works and the extent of mechanical power available, and of the total value of materials used by each producing enterprise. These particulars are obtained at intervals of five years under the existing arrangements. The enquiries extend also to the trade in which the metals and minerals obtained from the mines and smelting works are utilised in the production of the various commodities of which they form a constituent part.At the Department of Commercial Intelligence information oh all subjects of commercial interest is received from H.M. Trade Commissioners and Trade Correspondents within the Empire, and from His* The Geological Survey of Ireland was removed from the Geological Survey of Great Britain and placed under the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland in 1905.o   5937 B      r
SoMajesty&apos;s Diplomatic and Consular Representatives in foreign countries. The information thus collected is disseminated either by publication in the Board of Trade Journal, or confidentially through the machinery of the Departments Special Register of British Firms, and in other ways. Among other information bearing upon openings for British trade, the Department obtains a certain amount of information as to the metal requirements of countries abroad ; and incidentally to this work also receives occasional reports and other information as to the mineral resources of countries abroad.Amongst the publications issued by the Board of Trade, tho following contain information as to mineral resources and metal requirements : Annual Statement of the Trade of the United Kingdom.British and Foreign Trade and Industry.   (Memoranda, statistical tables and charts.) Coal. (1) Exports.   (2) Prices of exported.Coal and Petroleum.   (Statistical Tables and reports relating to coal and petroleum production of the principal countries of the world.)Iron and Steel.   (Statistical Tables and Reports relating to iron and steel production of the principal countries of the world.)Statistical Abstract for the British Empire.,, ,, ,,    Colonies and Possessions of United Kingdom., ,, ,, ,,    Principal and other foreign countries.,, ,,    United Kingdom.Statistical Tables relating to British Colonies, Possessions and Protectorates.Census of Production.Particulars of mines, tinplate works, iron and steel factories.Iron mines under the &quot;Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act,&quot; iron quarries, copper, brass, &amp;c. Iron Ore deposits in Foreign Countries.3. The Home Office. This Department, which is responsible for the administration of the Mines and Quarries Acts of the United Kingdom, collects and publishes annually, through its Mines Department,(a) statistics as to the production of minerals in the United Kingdom, with other particulars ;(b) statistics as to the production of minerals in the Colonies and Foreign Countries, with otherparticulars.These statistics appear in Parts III. and IV. respectively of the Aunual General Report of the Chief Inspector of Mines. (The collection and publication of mining statistics was originally carried out by the Mining Record Office, which was conjoined with the Geological Survey in 1840, but transferred to the Home Office in 1883.)The Home Office statistical work in connection with mines and quarries includes a good deal more, however, than the question of production. Owners of mines and quarries in the United Kingdom are required by statute to furnish the Home Office with full particulars of the working of their mines and quarries, including (in addition to returns relating to output) returns relating to numbers employed, accidents, use of explosives, use of electricity, &amp;c. The whole of the information is in normal times treated fully in the different volumes of the Chief Inspectors Annual Report, and to some extent also separately for each of the inspection divisions of the United Kingdom in the published Annual Reports of the Divisional Inspectors of Mines.The Home Office also publishes annually in normal times complete lists, with certain particulars of minerals worked, &amp;c, of all working mines and quarries in the United Kingdom, and every five years a list of abandoned mines of which plans, &amp;c, have been deposited at the Home Office in pursuance of the statutory requirements of the Mines Acts. These requirements date from 1872, but the Home Office collection of plans also includes a large number of old plans transferred from the late Mining Record Office.So far as production is concerned it will be sufficient for the present purpose to refer to the contents of Parts III. and IV. of the Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Mines.Part III., relating to the United Kingdom, contains (a) general and county summaries of the output of the various minerals worked, (b) detailed information in respect of the occurrence, output and value of the various minerals. In the case of mines under the Coal Mines Act, publication of individual returns of output and value is not allowed by the Act only aggregates may be published.Information is also given as to (1) the imports and exports, internal and coastwise transport, &amp;c. of various minerals ; (2) in the case of the more important metals the amount of the actual metal obtainable from the ore raised ; (3) the amount of pig iron produced at blast furnaces at the various works in the United Kingdom, the number of such furnaces and the amount of iron ore and coal used in the production ; (4) the production of coke at gasworks and coke ovens (including particulars of the numbers and kinds of ovens) and the quantity of coal used in the manufacture of the coke ; (6) the production of briquettes ; (6) variations in prices of certain metals, and other miscellaneous information. The information required for Part III. is obtained from the statutory Returns above mentioned and also from voluntary returns furnished by Trade Associations, mine aud quarry owners, manufacturers, railway and caual companies, H.M. Customs, (Kc.Part IV. (Colonial and Foreign Statistics) contains particulars as to the occurrence, output and value of minerals, and the metal actually produced from ores raised, in the case of practically every country in the world. Tables showing the number of persons employed and fatal accidents and death rates, &amp;c, are also given.The information required for this publication is obtained directly from the Government of the country concerned, through H.M. Consuls, from Colonial and Foreign publications, and in other ways.The actual tabulation of the returns and most of the work of collecting the information in regard to Foreign countries falls on the Mining Statistics Branch of the Home Office. But the statistical treatment of the results falls on the Chief Inspector of Mines and his staff, and a good deal of work in connection with the collection of the returns from miue and quarry owners in this country falls ou the
Inspectors of Mines. The statistical work, moreover, in regard to output, as pointed out above, is only a part of the statistical work of the Department,lit connection with mines. No exact estimate, therefore, can be formed of the cost of the statistical work of the Home Office in regard to minerals, but the Mining Statistics Branch is conducted at an annual cost of 1,172 .4. Colonial OrHce. While the publication of mineral and metallurgical statistics appertaining to the Colonies, Possessions, and Protectorates is included in the work of the Home Office (Minos Department), the variouo reports issued by the local authorities concerned are collected by the Colonial Office. Proposals for surveys and special investigations in colonies not possessing responsible government are referred to the Colonial Survey Committee of the Colonial Office, and in particular instances, where special reports are required, these are arranged for by the employment of experts temporarily appointed from this country.5. Imperial Institute. The established work of the Imperial Institute on minerals includes (1) the preparation of reports for the Governments or individuals concerned, on the composition and value for commercial and industrial purposes, of minerals, forwarded by Departments or individuals, from the Dominions, Colonies, and India ; (2) the institution as required of Mineral Surveys in British countries, and the examination and valuation of the minerals collected ; (3) the supply of information regarding minerals to enquirers at home and overseas ; (4) the collection and publication of information relating to the mineral resources of the Empire, and (5) the maintenance for public use of reference collections of minerals of commercial importance from all parts of the Empire.This work is carried on by a specially qualified staff with the advice of a Committee on Mineral Resources which includes, besides specialists, representatives of the principal Government Departments concerned ; the Home Office, Board of Trade, Admiralty, and War Office.The Institute publishes in its quarterly Bulletin (a) selected reports on mineral investigations and enquiries conducted at the Institute ; (6) monographs dealing especially with the mineral resources of the Empire, giving information regarding important occurrences, particulars of deposits worked, statistics of production, &amp;c. (arrangements are now in progress for the extension and separate publication of such monographs) ; (c) quarterly summaries of progress in connection with the occurrence and utilisation of minerals of economic importance. (For a more detailed statement of the work of the Imperial Institute, see pp. 25-25!)Since the beginning of the war, the Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, the War Office, the Foreign Office, &amp;c, have instituted specific inquiries, often by means of a questionnaire addressed to producers, with reference to the production of the particular mineral or metal in which the Department is interested. Furthermore, in the early part of this year, the Mineral Resources Development Department of the Ministry of Munitions was formed for the purpose of increasing the ,supply of minerals (other than coal and iron) in the United Kingdom, for war purposes.Apart from these State enterprises, various institutions such as the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, the Institution of Mining Engineers, the Institute of Metals, the Iron and Steel Institute, have, from the point of view of their respective interests, for many years collected information on Mineral Resources and Metal Production. On the latter point they are in frequent communication with Trade Organisations and Metal Brokers throughout the world, and receive daily or weekly the Bulletins which such organisations issue as well as the frequent publications of State Mines Bureaux. Numerous Trade Journals contain articles specially devoted to statistics of output, &amp;c, and are frequently quoted in such books as the &quot; Coin-parative Statistics &quot; issued by the Metallgesellschaft and Roush&apos;s &quot; Mineral Industry.&quot;On the purely technical side of Mineralogy and Mining there are the learned societies, and the field 0 Research is covered by such institutions as the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Geological Survey and Museum (Board of Edueatiou), the Imperial Institute (Colonial Office), the Imperial College of Science and Technology, South Kensington, &amp;c, &amp;c.ireland.1. The organisations which exist in Ireland for the collection of information as to the Mineral Resources of the country are : (a) The Home Office.(b) The Geological Survey of Ireland, under the Authority of the Department of Agriculture andTechnical Instruction.No information of a statistical nature appears to be collected as to the metal requirements.2. The Geological Survey does not collect information in regard to other countries, such collection being included in the work of the Home Office.3. The Home Office collects its information through specially appointed Mines Inspectors. The Geological Survey obtains the material included in its publications in reference to the mines already in existence and the occurrences of economic minerals through the agency of the Staff Geologists and their assistants. The Survey also utilises published mineral statistics, mining plans and technical journals, in obtaining data for its own publications.4. During the time which has elapsed since the commencement of the War the issue of publications by the Survey has been practically suspended.5. There does not appear to be any private organisation existing in Ireland for the collection of genera information as to mineral resources.   The two organisations already mentioned are both State Departments.B 2
CANADA.1. Tlic organisations existing in the Dominion for the collection of information as to the Mineral Resources and Production of Canada appear to be as follows : (i) There is a Division of Mineral Resources and Statistics in the Dominion Department of Mines at Ottawa which is concerned in the annual collection of Statistics of mining and metallurgical production and the compilation aud publication of reports thereon. The Division distributes to mining companies throughout Canada schedules for the return of production during the preceding year.   The Division also furnishes information available to inquirers.(ii) Tho Provincial Bureaux of Mines obtain, in the majority of instances, returns and  otherStatistical information from the mine-owners within the Province, by monthly, quarterly, and annual Statements.(iii) The Canadian Geological Survey issue from time to time the results of the explorations andsurveys carried out by members of the Staff and information collected by them during the course of surveys.2. There does not appear to be any collection of similar information in respect of other countries further than to utilise published Statistics for occasional comparison.3. The information is collected : (ij By the various officials appointed to administer the Provincial laws and regulations by the Provincial Governments.(ii) By the various Bureaux of Mines, where such exist in the Provinces where mining iscarried on.(iii) By the Dominion Department of Mines through the Dominion Gold Commissioners, MiningRecorders and Mining Inspectors, where the administration is under the Dominion, as opposed to the Provincial Government.(iv) By the field officials of the Canadian Geological Survey.There are legal obligations upon mine-owners, mill-owners and claim-holders, to furnish figures of the production, but the regulations are not uniform, varying from one Province to another, while, in respect to the Dominion authority, there is no general mining law at present in force.4. Where the returns are compulsorily required (a) they are collected from the mine-owners themselves by the local (Provincial or Dominion) officials, (/;) at intervals of one month, three months and 12 months, the latter being required at all centres ; (c) the information so collected is available in the case of the Dominion, administration through the reports of the Department of Mines, Ottawa, and in the case of Provincial administration, through the annual reports of the Bureaux of Mines.5. The constitution of the organisations is departmental, and the cost is not specially estimated, save as a part of the ordinary Provincial or Dominion Expenditure.Canadian Committee of Scientific and Industrial ResearchThe constitution of the Canadian Committee of Scientific and Industrial Research consists of a Committee of Council and an Honorary Advisory Committee. The former comprises the Ministers of Trade and Commerce, the Interior, Mines, Inland Revenue, Labour and Agriculture, and is charged with, aril is responsible for, the expenditure of moneys provided for scientific and industrial research. The latter is. composed of nine members representative of the scientific and industrial interests of Canada.The duties of the Advisory Committee are defined as follows : (a) To consult with all responsible bodies and persons carrying on scientific and industrial researchwork in Canada with a view to bringing about united effort and mutual co-operation in solving the various problems of scientific and industrial research which from time to time present themselves.(b) To co-ordinate as far as possible the work so carried on so as to avoid overlapping of effort,and to direct the various problems requiring solution into the hands of those whose equipment and ability are best adapted thereto.(c) To select the most practical and pressing problems indicated by industrial necessities and presentthem when approved by the Committee to the research bodies for earliest possible solution.(d) To report from time to time the progress and results of their work to the Minister of Trade andCommerce as Chairman of the Committee of Council.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.1. The organisations existing in the Commonwealth of Australia for the collection of information as to the Mineral Resources and Production of the Commonwealth are : (i) The Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics, to which the State Statistical Bureaux contribute, collects information on a great variety of subjects. -   (ii) The State Statistical Bureaux operating under the various State Governments receive information from the Mines Departments.(iii) Although there is no Commonwealth Department of Mines, each State Government has a Depart-ment of Mines which is responsible for the conducting of the Geological Survey, where such has been established within the State, and the administration of the State Mining Legislation.(iv) The Australian Metal Exchange, where every transaction in ores aud metals has to be registeredconfidentially, in order to obtain permission to export, thus affording to the Commonwealth Government an exact record of all Australian trade in ores, concentrates, and unwrought metals.2. The Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics collects similar information in respect to the Mineral Resources aud Metal Requirements of other countries.
3. Information is collected by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics through (i) its own officers ; (ii) tho various Federal and State Departments ; (iji) the official reports and publications issued by such Departments, and . (iv) Trade Returns, Technical Journals, Reports issued by Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of Mines, &amp;c.The information published by tho various Departments of Mines is obtained from the returns collected by the Wardens and Mining Registrars appointed to administer the Mining Acts and Regulations in the. particular State concerned. The details of tho returns are furnished to the Wardens and Registrars by tho holders of Claims and Leases and comprise the area worked, men employed, output, method of mining followed (surface, driving or sinking), quantity and value of minerals won. As the tenure, generally speaking, depends ou the carrying out of labour and working conditions on all claims and leases, the filing of the Statistical returns by the holders with the Wardens or Registrars is a condition of security. 1The State Departments of Mines issue from time to time special reports on particular mining fields and areas, especially in regard to new discoveries, such reports being made by officers of the Geological Survey or State Geological Department.The Departments of Mines possess authority to impose and enforce legal obligations on mine owners and others to supply figures of their production under the various Mining Regulations.4. The appended list of State publications dealing with Mineral Resources gives the periodicity of issue. The Federal Government issues, in addition to the reports of the Bureau of Census and Statistics, the &quot; Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia.&quot;(i) New South   Wales.

Australian Advisory Council of Science and Industry.The Federal Government of Australia convened, in January 1916, a conference to discuss the development of the primary add secondary industries of the Commonwealth, and especially the application of science to industry.The conference, which assembled at Melbourne under the presidency of the Prime Minister, was composed of the Ministers of State Agriculture Departments and representatives of the Universities, the Associated Chambers of Manufactures and&apos; Commerce, Mining and other industries and the Scientific Government Departments. A committee was appointed to formulate proposals to the Government and presented a report which recommended the establishment, by Act of Parliament, of the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry to consider and initiate scientific research in connection with the primary and secondary industries of the Commonwealth, to collect statistical information ; establish National Laboratories and promote immediate utilisation of existing institutions, &amp;c. The constitution of the Institute was suggested as an Advisory Council of nine members representative of science and industry, and appointed to co-operate with the Directors in framing the policy and administration of the Institute ; the Directors to be three highly qualified salaried experts (1) iu business and finance and (2) in science and experience, one of whom shall be appointed as Chairman, and all of whom shall seek the advice and co-operation of the Advisory Council, of which body they shall be cx-officio members. The immediate appointment of an Advisory Council to deal with matter in pressing need of investigation was also recommended.The Federal Government adopted the recommendation for the immediate appointment of an Advisory Council and agreed to postpone for the present the establishment of the Institute. The membership of the Advisory Council was made as widely representative as possible and comprised 34 members, including the six State Ministers for Agriculture who are ex-officio members. The Prime Minister of Australia or, in his absence, the Vice-president of the Federal Executive Council is Chairman.An Executive Committee of 13 members was appointed for the general control and direction of the work already iu hand and a committee was also established in each State consisting of the State representatives on the Advisory Council together with associate members appointed on the nomination of the respective State Governments. The Chairman of each State Committee is ex officio- a member of the central Executive Committee.NEW ZEALAND.I. The organisations which exist in the Dominion of New Zealand for the purpose of collecting information as to the Mineral Resources and Production are the Mines Department and the Customs Department, Wellington.The former includes the Geological Survey, Inspection of Mines, and the Schools of Mines ; also controls two State Coal Mines which supply fuel to State Railways, and retail supplies to house-holders.The latter compiles statistics showing both the import and the export of minerals at the various Ports of the Dominion ; also collects gold duty on all gold raised and exported.The Government Statistician compiles very full statements showing importation of iron, steel, railway material, &amp;c., which tend to show the exact metal requirements.2. Similar information in respect of other countries does not appear to be collected by these organisa-rions, but comparisons are sometimes made with statements taken from publications issued in other countries.3. The information collected by the statistical branch of the Department of Mines is obtained from the mine owners and claim holders in periodical returns compulsorily furnished to the various wardens and mining registrars of the districts. The information collected by the Geological Survey is obtained by members of the Staff in the districts where field work is being carried on. The information issued by the Customs Department at Wellington is compiled from the returns furnished by the Customs officials at the different Ports of the Domiuion. The periodical returns are furnished by the mine owners and claim holders, under legal obligation, failure on their part to carry out the regulations enacted under the Mining Laws endangering the security of their tenure.4. The information obtained by the Department of Mines is made available by the issue of quarterly statements and the annual report of the Department. The Statistics compiled by the Customs Departments are included in the annual report of the Department. The information is also incorporated in the official &quot; Year Book of New Zealand,&quot; published annually.5. The constitution of the organisations for the collecting of the information as to mineral resources and metal requirements of the Dominion of New Zealand is departmental and part of the State Administrative machinery. The cost is included in the general votes of credit and cannot therefore be estimated, the more especially as fees and other items of income are not shown as offsets.Reference is also made to the National Efficiency Board, established 27th February 1917, under Section (iii), War Regulations Amendment Act, 1916, and in conformity with the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1908, for inquiring (1) ,l as to the best methods to be adopted for the production and preparation &quot; of raw materials ;(2) &quot;as to the statistics of New Zealand and other countries with respect to the condition of &quot; employment . . . . . output and production, in connection with any industry or &quot; industries &quot; ; and(3)    as to the advisability of adopting improved methods for the instruction and technical training of &quot; workers with a view to securing more efficient service, and, generally, as to the necessity for &quot; further technical education and for scientific research with respect to the maintenance, development, or establishment of industries.&quot; r
National Efficiency Board of New Zealand.With a \iow to enable the Government to make provision for the organisation and development of industries, for the enforcement of public and private economy, and generally for increasing national efficiency, and to determine what further legislation (if any) if is necessary or expedient to pass with reference to these matters, a Commission consisting of five members representative of tho various industrial and commercial interests throughout the Dominion of New Zealand was appointed in March last as a Board of National Efficiency.The immediate attention of the members is being devoted to the different methods and systems at present in use in industrial and commercial undertakings with a view to increasing efficiency by the general adoption of those methods shown to be the best in the production and preparation of raw materials whether indigenous to New Zealand or otherwise ; to inquiry as to the advisability of adopting improved methods for the instruction and technical training of workers and the necessity for further technical education and scientific research with respect to the maintenance, development, or establishment of industries, and the establishment of new industries and development of those industries already existing.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.Hie work of collecting information as to the Mineral Resources aud Production of the Union is performed by the Department of Mines and Industries, the compilation of statistical information being undertaken in the Office of the Government Mining Engineer, Johannesburg. In addition to monthly statistics of output, published by the Government Mining Engineer, this* officer makes an annual report to the Secretary for Mines and Industries, reviewing the Avork of his branch for the past year, aud containing information under the headings : Labour, Wages and Stores, Output and Development, Accidents and Prosecutions, Technical Examinations, Machinery and Mechanical, Laboratory, and General. The work of the biaucn deals not only with the collection, tabulation, and publication of statistics, but also such matters as Mines and Works inspections and accident inquiries, explosives, mechanical and chemical testing, valuation of mineralized ground, technical investigations into applications for surface rights on proclaimed ground, mining leases, determination of lives of mines for Profits Tax, consideration of appli-cations for licences for power undertakings, Miners&apos; Training School at the Wolhuter Gold Mines, and the Drill and Battery Plant, Natal. The staff of the branch at the end of 1915 numbered 105 persons of all grades, and the cost of administration for the current year is estimated at 52,612/. The staff is distributed between the head office in Johannesburg and eight inspectorates. &apos; The inspecting officers are of four types, Inspectors of Mines, Inspectors of Machinery, Inspectors of Explosives, and the Mines Survey Staff. The Department collects a revenue from fines under the Mining Acts for breaches of regulations, fees on applications for certificates of various kinds, fees for tests in mechanical laboratory, hire of Government drills, &amp;c. ; the revenue for the year 1915 totalling 8,705/.Since 1913, assays and mineral analyses have been undertaken by the branch for the benefit of prospectors and others at a special low tariff. The identification of minerals is undertaken by the Geological Survey Department, Pretoria, free of charge.The Government Mining Engineer is empowered under the Mines and Works Act, No. 12, of 1911, to obtain returns of output, &amp;c. from producers. The regulations under the Act provide that &quot; The owner or manager of a mine or works shall forward monthly to the office of the Government Mining Engineer coni-&quot; plete and correct returns for the preceding month of the work accomplished during that month, the persons &quot; employed, and the results obtained.&quot; The word &quot;mines&quot; is defined in the widest terms and includes excavations for precious stones, aud heavy penalties are imposed for breaches of the Mining Regulations.No information is at present available as to whether the Statistical Office of the Inspector collects information as to metal requirements of the Union, or as to the resources, production, or requirements of other parts of the world.Industries Advisory Board of South Africa.In 1915 the Government of the Union of South Africa appointed a Munitions and Industries Committee, the membership of which was representative of Chambers of Commerce and Manufacturers Associations, withiu the Union, to consider how far the manufacture of machinery parts and other requirements of tho Union could be undertaken in order to relieve, as far as possible, the workshops of the United Kingdom, The Committee, in their report, made suggestions on which the Government acted by appointing an Industries Advisory Board with instructions to carry the investigations initiated by the Committee still further.The appointment of the members of the Industries Advisory Board was for three years, representatives of commerce, manufacture and labour being chosen and the following specific subjects were referred to them for investigation : (a) Statistics aud Information.(b) Scientific and Industrial Research.(c) Questions of Industrial Legislation. ((/) Encouragement of Local Industries.(e) Investigation into available raw products of the country.The Board in turn recommended : (1) A Statistical Act to be put into force and an Industrial Census carried out between June andSeptember of this year, in order, for the first time, to give South Africa accurate informationin regard to the general industrial position of the country. (2) An Industry Section to be appointed to deal with all Scientific and Technical questions andquestions of Research referred to it by the Industrial Advisory Board.The Government constituted the Industry Section, consisting of 10 members representative of Metallurgy, Biology, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Geology, with the President of the Royal Society of South Africa au ex-officio member.&apos; B i
The objects set forth for the consideration of tlio Section included, amongst others : (rt) Co-operation with oilier Government Departments and with similar departments in the United Kingdom and Dominions to obtain information already available, to avoid overlapping and to take advantage of research not available in South Africa. , (b) The carrying out of an economic survey of the natural resources of South Africa.(c) The furnishing of advice as to the best methods of utilising such resources.(d) Tho standardisation of scientific and industrial quantities affecting the efficiency of productionand the accuracy of statistics, (c) Educational work such as lecturing, publication of technical information and establishment of technological museums in suitable localities.Immediate steps are being taken by the section for special survey work to be initiated in con-nection with Minerals.Botanical Questions. Water Power. Fisheries.Also, as a preliminary for the commencement of a proper system of Scientific Research, a census is (o be made, of the facilities for investigation and research already existing withir the Union of South Africa.(1) In respect of available laboratories and institutions. (2) Staff available for research work.In furtherance of the work thus undertaken the Government of the Union of South Africa is advertising for applications from suitable persons for the position of Scientific and Technical Adviser to the Industry Section. The appointment will be under the Department of Mines and Industries, for a period of three years (renewable at the option of the Government), at a salary of 2,000/. per annum.NEWFOUNDLAND.I. The organisations existing for the purpose of collecting information as to the Mineral Resources and Production of Newfoundland are :  (The Department of Agriculture and Mines ; The Customs Department; The Board of Trade ; The Geological Survey.2. The Board of Trade and the Customs Department appear to collect similar information in respect of other Countries, the Head of the latter Department having been appointed &quot;Imperial Trade Correspondent for the Colony&quot; to foster the imparting and accumulation of all information likely to be of value in the development of the resources and the trade of the Colony.3. The information is collected by the local officers of the departments named and from the returns sent in by the larger mining Companies and corporations which hold their areas by direct agreement with the Crown, endorsed by special Acts of the Colonial Legislature. The furnishing of returns is in all cases compulsory under the mining regulations issued by the Department for the particular districts and interests concerned.4. The cost of the State organisations is included in the different Departmental votes, and details are not immediately available. There are apparently no private organisations specifically collecting information in regard to the mineral resources and metal requirements, but the locally published Year Books and Hand-books for the Colony occasionally contain specially contributed articles of an informative nature dealing with the subject.INDIA.In India the organisations concerned in the collection of information as to Mineral Resources are three in -immber-(1) the Geological Survey of India ; (2) the Mines Department; and (3) the Statistical Department.The work of these organisations is shown in the following notes :-(1) Geological Survey.The Department, which was founded in 1850, is at present constituted as follows :  Organisation; 1 director, at 1,600/. ;3 superintendents, at 800/. 1,120/.; ,15 assistant   superintendents, at 280/.  800/. (including a   curator, geological museum and laboratory) ; 1 chemist, at 400/.-800/.In addition, an artist, two sub-assistants, an assistant curator, and two field collectors are employed. Appointments to the superior staff are made in England, by the Secretary of State for India, advised by&apos; geological experts, including the Director of the Geological Survey in England.Duties. The primary work of the Department is the preparation of a complete geological map of India, on, the scale of one mile to an inch, including, so far as is possible, the Native States. This survey has as its object the development of the mineral resources of the country, and on the economic side the work of the Department has increased very considerably in recent years. The investigation of mineral deposits is undertaken, and the results are brought to the notice of commercial men with whom the , Depaitment is m close touch,
(2) Mines Department.The Indian Mines Department consists of 5 officers, 1 Chief Inspector and 4.Inspectors. The duties of the staff are generally to administer the Mines Act (Act VIII. of 1901) and to advise Government on mining questions and mining education. .    ,     .i The Act applies only to. underground mines more than 20-feet deep, and provides for their inspection and examination, with special reference to the condition of the working, ventilation, and the safety of persons employed.\ &quot; Though its duties are primarily of this nature, the Department also collects and publishes in its Annual Report information as to the number of mines in each district, the number and condition of workers, and the output for each of the following.kinds of minerals, the causes of variation being briefly discussed :-Coal, mica, manganese, limestone, salt, gems (rubies^ sapphires, spinels), slate, gold, iron,..... wolfram, magnesite, chromite, copper ore, bauxite, clay, galena, steatite, silver, samarskite, Fuller&apos;sEarth, tin. ;     i&apos; As quarries and mines less than 20 feet deep are outside the scope of the Mines Act, the figures -published in the report do not Completely represent the mineral production of the country.Figures of production of all minerals in British India and Native States, whether from workings under the Act or not, are published in the Annual Records and the Quinquennial Review of the Geological Survey of India. Figures for Mysore, where most of the Indian gold is raised, are given in the report of the Chief Inspector of that State.(3) Statistical Department.This Department is not concerned with the collection of statistics from original sources, but collates and tabulates figures received from other Departments. Statistics regarding mineral production published by the Department will.be found in Volume 1. (Commercial Statistics) of the Statistical Abstract for British India. Table 23 is an abstract sta.t.ement..sho.wiug. from 1890 onwards the quantity and value of minerals for which, approximately, accurate figures are obtainable (salt, coal, gold, petroleum, jadestone, lead, maguesite, manganese, mica, monazite, chromite, diamonds, graphite, iron ore, gems, saltpetre, silver, tin, wolfram). Other tables show the quantity and value of the main minerals produced in each Province or State, the consumption of kerosene in India, the average value per ton of Indian coal and of Indian and Welsh coal at the chief ports,- and an estimate of the&apos; avail able supply of coal in India and of the coal exported from India.The figures for coal are compiled from, the Statutory RetUrftsof output furnished to the Chief Inspector of Mines by the managers of mines. The figures regarding other minerals are in the main supplied by the Director, Geological Survey of India.; ;     &quot;   --      , ;     &apos;.;     ,v ,The Statistical Department also publishes a separate Annual Report on the production and consumption of coal in India. .\   - -     -    , , , ,\ i      . &apos; &apos; .Except as regards coal, salt, and kerosene, none of the tables show consumption of minerals in India. &apos;RHODESIA.1. The organisations existing in Rhodesia for the. purpose of collecting information as to the Mineral Resources and Production of the country are the Mines Department and the Geological Survey.2. Information in respect to other African and South African countries appear to he collected by. these organisations. &apos;&apos; &apos; 1        1 r       j : m       . ..     &apos;\. . t&apos; ..o ;59&apos;3V.  - ......- .&apos;,.&apos;v-......&apos; -        J J &apos; Y -   .,&apos;C     &apos;. The teaching of geology at tho Universities of Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras is also in the hands of the Department.When information, collected by tho regular survey party, suggests the possibility of any now develop-ment of mineral resources in an area hitherto unworked, officers of tho Department are deputed to make a detailed survey and examination, to estimate the extent of the deposits, and to advise whether they can be Worked commercially. Samples are collected and sent to the Department for analysis and report. The latest reports show that special inquiries have recently been made in petroliferous localities; that potash and salt deposits have been examined; and that special attention has been given to cobalt, molybdenite, wolfram, and manganese.Officers of tho Department are always ready to assist and advise private persons and companies engaged in developing the mineral resources of the country, and the advice given has frequently prevented foolish ventures and avoided waste of money.Publications.-The Publications of the Department include:  (1) An Annual Report of the work done ;(2) Annual and Quinquennial Reviews of the mineral production of India.   These reviews give 1* detailed statistics of production, and describe, in the case of each mineral, the steps taken,successful or otherwise, to extract it, suggesting, where possible, improved methods of working. , The quinquennial report especially (296 pages in 1915) is a publication of great &apos;    , commercial value.(3) Records of the Geological Department; and r.   - b.(4) Memoirs containing papers on different subjects written by members of the Department.
3. The information is collected (1) by the Department through its staff of Registrar of Claims, Mining Commissioners and Inspectors, and (2) by the geologists employed in the field throughout the eight districts into which the territory is divided for the purposes of the Geological Survey. Mine owners are under legal obligation to furnish figures of their production.4. The information so collected is made available by the issue of State papers and the publication of periodical returns (quarterly and annual). .5. The organisations are Government institutions atid the cost is defrayed by the ordinary Departmental votes,CROWN AND OTHER COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES.1. In Crown Colonies where speoial Mining Departments are not in existence the Customs and Revenues Establishment is usually utilised for the collecting of such information as to the production of minerals and the imports of metals as is available. The Customs Officials in turn sometimes obtain assistance from the local banks, as mineral products in Colonies so situated are frequently disposed of through a banking agency. In those Colonies not possessing responsible Government and Protectorates where a mineral export is more or less established, the collecting of information, as regards minerals, is allocated to distinctive Government Departments, ranging from a Geological Survey, as in the Gold Coast, to a Department of Science, as in British Guiana, or simply a Government Inspector. Occasionally special reports are prepared by an expert temporarily appointed from this country. In the case of native production of iron, salt, &amp;c., accurate information is rarely available. Proposals for surveys and special investigations are referred to the Colonial Survey Committee.2. In no instance does a Crown Colony organisation appear to collect similar information in respect to other countries.3. The information as to production, &amp;c, is generally collected by direct inspection of the miues, examination of the books of account and the records of minerals treated and quantities won, as well as by means of the returns which mine owners are compelled to furnish. There is usually a legal obligation imposed on mine owners to supply figures of their production, with provisions for the inflicting of a penalty in the case of failure to do so,4. The&apos;information so collected is included in the annual Blue Books forwarded by the Government to the Colonial Office and subsequently appears in the official publications. In many cases Departmental reports are published locally. The consumption of imported metals may be gauged from the statistics furnished in the same Blue Books, abstracts of which are published in the Annual Blue Book Report.5. The contribution of the organisation in Crown Colonies is entirely Departmental and the cost is provided for accordingly.A certain amount of information is collected and published in some Colonies by private bodies, such as the British Guiana Institute of Mines and Forests and the West Africa Chamber of Mines. As a rule the information is derived from official sources. Government Officers who are interested sometimes make useful observations and send home specimens.   Sitch activities are encouraged.A series of detailed statements follow in regard to .     Ceylon.Federated Malay States. Gold Coast Colony.Ceylon.1. The organisations existing in Ceylon for the collection of information as to the Mineral Resources are The Department of Mines, under the authority of the Inspector of Mines ; The Mineralogical Survey. 2. There does not appear to be any collection of similar information in regard to other countries carried out by either of these organisations.3. The Colonial Secretary of the Ceylon Government issues an Annual Blue Book Report in which is included a summary of the various reports from the Departments within his control. The statistics are obtained by the local officers concerned in the administration and are subsequently tabulated by the Statistical Branch of the main Department. The Mineralogical Survey Statistics are collected and tabulated by the Principal Surveyor and the Assistant Surveyor.4. As mining for metallic minerals is not generally conducted at present on a large scale in Ceylon, special legal enactments have not been promulgated to compel mine owners to furnish returns. Where mining for metallic minerals or gems is carried out on Crown Lands authority is contained ia the concession granted and returns are required as a condition.5. There are apparently no private concerns taking part in the obtaining of Statistical information concerning minerals, but the periodical reports of the Chamber of Commerce give figures as to plumbago.
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The organisations existing in the United States for the collection of information in regard to the Mineral Resources and , Production of the country are both numerous and various, comprising Federal Government Departments a;id Bureaux, State Government Departments, and Institutions representative of scientific, commercial, developmental and general interests. -  .The more important among the Federal organisations are : (i) Commerce and Labour Department.Created in 1903 as an Executive Department and organised into fourteen publishing divisions, of which the Census Bureau, the Statistics Bureau, and the Manufacturers Bureau deal with matters appertaining to mining, mineral resources, and metal requirements. The Bureaux issue periodical reports (annual, decennial, and abstracts), Bulletins and Monographs. The Manufacturers Bureau issues daily, monthly, and annual reports &quot; supplying all available and useful information &quot; as may tend to &quot; foster, promote, and develop the. various manufacturing industries of the United States and the markets for the same at home and abroad.&quot; The Statistics Bureau issue, amongst others, a monthly summary of commerce aud finance; a monthly statement pf imports and exports, and a statistical&apos; abstract (annually) which includes mining and the imports and exports of minerals amongst its divisions,(ii) Interior Department.Established 1849 in succession to the Internal Affairs Department, has the supervision of the Geological Survey and Reclamation Service. The annual publication &quot;Mineral Resources,&quot; originated in 1866 and reorganised in 1882, consists of statistical and general information concerning the mineral industry of the United States, giving location of deposits, prices, consumption, uses, and special articles on technical subjects by expert writers. The Department also issues the annual reports of the Mine Inspection for Indian Territory and the Mine Inspection for New Mexico.(iii) The Treasury Department. &apos;----.In which is included the Mint Bureau, the latter issuing an annual report on the Production of Precious Metals, containing &quot;Statistics of annual production of precious metals by States and countries, together with miscellaneous statistics of production abroad, coinage, deposits, purchases, price, imports, exports, &amp;c, of gold and silver.&quot;   Special papers on mining, &amp;c, are also sometimes included.(iv) The Bureau of Mines.The Bureau of Mines was established as a separate branch of the Department of the Interior in 1910. Its aims are :  .:(a) to bring about greater efficiency and the prevention of waste in the extraction, preparation, andutilisation of mineral products, and (/*) to secure the safety aud health of workers in the mining industries,C 2Federated Malay States.1. The organisations existing in the Federated Malay States for the collection of information as to the Mineral Resources of the country are-&apos; &apos; *&quot; The Mines Department.The Geological Department.2. Neither of these Departments collects similar information in regard to other Countries, but attention is given to tin development elsewhere.3. The Senior Warden of Mines and his assistant Wardens obtain the Statistical information from Mine Owners in the various districts into which the respective States are divided. These returns are subsequently tabulated and included in the Annual Report prepared by tlie Chief Secretary.4. The mines are mostly worked on concessions issued direct to mine owners, subject to the carrying out of any regulations which may from time to time be promulgated. The furnishing of returns can therefore be enforced by the Department.5. There does not appear to bo any other organisation existing for the purpose of collecting informa-tion as to the mineral resources and metal requirements of the Federated States, other than the State Departments named. The cost is included in the General Departmental expenditure, and details are not immediately available.........; v - . .  .i  Gold Coast Colony.1. The Gold Coast Department of Mines collects information with regard to the mining industry and publishes it in an annual report. The Staff consists of a Secretary for Mines, Inspectors and a clerical establishment. The Geological Survey is engaged in work preliminary to the preparation of a geological map of the Colony and in investigating the mineral resources.. It will in due course issue a series of publications.   Statistics of import and export are prepared by the Customs Department.2. Similar information is not collected in respect of other countries.3. Information with regard to the mines is obtained by regular inspection of the mines and from statutory returns. Mineral resources are investigated by ordinary field work methods during the dry season and worked out during the wet. season by the officers of the Survey at the Imperial College of Science, where space is granted them. The Imperial College also undertakes analyses. and part of the scientific examination.4. The information is included in the annual Blue Books forwarded by the Government to the Colonial ^Office and subsequently appears in the official publication.&quot;&quot;&apos; 5. The estimated&apos;expenditure of the Gold Coast Colony for 1917 for the Mines Department is 3,162/. and for the Geological Survey 2,963/.
Organisatioih-ThQ investigations of the Bureau aro grouped under five principal divisions as follows: (a) Mining Division, (w) Metallurgical Division, (e) Mineral Technology Division, (d) Fuels and Mechanical Equipment Division, and (e) Petroleum Division, The. Chemical. Research Laboratory maintained by the Bureau atPittsburg performs work for each of these divisions.,.General Nature of Work. Tho general nature of the work of tho Bureau may bo classified under the following headings, viz. :  ,(a) Investigations into improved methods of treating ores. . .      ... ,  .     .       .(b) Investigations into methods of eliminating waste of metals, ores and minerals. .    ,(c) Investigations into causes and prevention of coal mine explosions.(d) Investigations into, and the regulation of explosives used in coal mines.(e) Investigations into, and the regulation of the use of electricity in mining.(/) Investigations into, and the regulation of mine lighting. &quot; &apos;;    j&apos;(ff) The use and efficiency of various types of rescue apparatus, . .   .(h) The study of safety and health problems, in metal jnines, ;      - n .&quot;, .    , :(*) Imrestigatious into the causes of waste in the production of oil and natural gas. f-notu(j) Compilation, unification, and improvement of State laws relating to the mineral industry.It will be noted that the collection of information as to mineral resources or metal requirements forms no part of the duties of the Bureau of.Mines. . t ,i     .&apos;The expenditure of the Bureau is about 120,000/. per annum, to which Corporations and Institutions interested in investigatory work contribute. In its work the Bureau seeks the co-operation of all interested persons, and welcomes the assistance and advice of workmen&apos;s Organisations, of technical societies, and of Slate officials and. State Governments.     . . .   , ,  .     .........In certain aspects of the investigatory work carried on by the Bureau On behalf of particular interests co-operative agreements are entered into between the Bureau and,those interests, specifying the liabilities and duties of each party. Funds are contributed by those on whose behalf the investigation is being made, and consequently, at the outset, it is only required to make a small appropriation1, from the general funds of the Bureau to cover administrative and travelling expenses.     &apos;The GEor.oc.iCAT.

A further serial issuo, since 1882, is Mineral -Rpsoijrces, an annual continuation of a series published by ihe Treasury Department from 1866 to 1876 on the Mineral Resources West of the Rocky Mountains.: Each volume consists of statistical&apos;and general information concerning the mineral industry of the United States, giying location of deposits, prices, consumption, uses, &amp;c., together with special articles by expert authorities on minerals, materials, mineral waters,, mineral paints, abrasiyo materials, &amp;c.It was published separately from 1882 to 1893 ; as&apos;part, of the Survey Annual Report from 1894 to 1899. and as an independent publication since 1900.1&apos;- &apos; ,The issue of a Topographic Atlas was originated in 1882, when the Survey was ordered to make a Geologic Atlas of the United States. Before the latter could be produced a topographic map was. necessary, and, as-none was then in existence, the Survey produced one which is issued in sheet form for sections. Each sheet shows (i) the&apos;water features, including sea, lakes, ponds, rivers and other natural streams, -canals and irrigation ditches ; (ii) terrestrial features, including mountains, hills, and valleys ; (iii) cultural features, including towns, cities, roads, railroads, boundaries, and names.. v . The Geologic, Atlas has been issued, in numbered folios since 1891. The entire area of the United States is divided into small quadrangles bounded by meridians and parallels, each of which forms a unit of,surve,y, and-of-publication- The features -included in each -unit are topographic, geologic, economic, and structural, together with a general description, .&apos; ,. .The Survey also issues General Publications, which consist of-occasional special&apos;reports, list of publications and routine miscellany.      - &apos;     &quot;   , ...The annual cost of the Survey is about 300,000?. (290,984/., for 1916), covered by allocations, by Congress. The States of the Union make no direct financial contribution to the Geological Survey, except that.when maps are,being constructed by the Topographical Department, the State whose area is being mapped pays one half the expense: Occasionally in turn the Survey will lend an expert to work with the States on a given problem. -&apos; The Survey has no power to compel either States or individuals to supply information as to output, production, refining capacity, &amp;c.The Survey issues inquiries in the form of questionnaire, and the States sometimes take a hand by following up cases where information is withheld or is behindhand, but the supply of information is in any ,-c.aseentirely, voluntary $,nd;cannot- be compelled either by the State or by the Survey.   Compulsory, powers are, however, possessed by the Federal Trade Commission in connection with its periodic inquiries, which in some cases overlap, the-sphere normally, controlled by the Geological Suryey.1.;   ,There have been instances, e.g^, in connection with some of the Ferro-Alloys and with Aluminium, -?w.here information earnestly desired by the Geological Survey has been: withheld by interests controlling resources.   But, on. the.whole, the,Director js of opinion that the voluntary system works satisfactorily.:&apos; : ; In the questionnaire itself the addressee is often asked whether he wishes his answer to be kept confidential, or whether he will allow it to be published, and his wishes are in all cases strictly complied with. &apos;  ,, &apos; &apos;&quot;&apos; ;-      ;&apos;:   &quot;   : : &apos; &apos;; &quot;l :&apos;&apos;&quot;There have been instances where other Government Departments, and, even in one case, the Senate, have pressed the Geological Survey to disclose information revealed by their inquiries, which they did not wish to reveal, and the Survey has carried its point iii retaining the right to withhold the information.The Geological Survey compile and issue- information as to the mineral resources of all Foreign Countries from which such information is obtainable, acquiring figures and facts wherever possible at first hand, e.g.; in the Mexican-Oil Fields. &apos;*.   ...- The Director lays great emphasis on the fact that the Staff who conduct Geological inquiries, aud the Staff who, compile statistics as to output, are the same people, that is, that they are Geologists first and Statisticians second, working- always with an eye on resources for the future as well as on actual output&quot;uptOdatOi   -&apos;&quot; - -     - yi       &quot; -&apos;-&apos; ,&quot;  -&apos; &apos; &apos; - &apos;.&apos;&quot;,&apos;   ! ;&apos;v&apos;; ;&apos;c &apos; &apos;U.S.A, Geological Survey Vote.)&quot;t&quot;V &quot;.1 1        T, Appropriation. . ..N,        .11 -    ,     &quot; 1 . . &apos;..:.:-&apos;..     - - . $Salaries, Office of Director -     -     -     - - - .-     .... 35,340     . \x&apos;,,    rScientific Assistants   ; -     -   &quot; -     - 29,900^ .

FRANCE.1. Information concerning Mineral Resources, and Production of Mines and Quarries is collected by the Engineers of the Mining Corps.France is divided up into Mineralogical Circuits at the head of each of which there is a Chief Engineer of Minos; in each Mineralogical Circuit there are two or three sub-sections, at the head of each of which there is an ordinary Engineer for Mines who has under his command three or four Controllers.The work of the Engineers front the Statistical point of view is condensed in the &quot; Statistics of Mineral Industry &quot; (Statistique do iTndustrie Minerale) which is published annually. These Statistics also, it is understood, give information on the production of Pig Iron and Steel, as well as useful information concerning Steam apparatus existing in the country.2. The Mining Engineers generally know, at least on broad lines, the resources of other countries. But that is a question of personal knowledge and has nothing in common with Administrative work.3. The information collected in the &quot; Statistics of the Mineral Industry &quot; is gained on the spot by the Engineers and the Controllers, and is also compiled from the declarations of Mining Research made by prospectors, from the verifications made on the spot by the Engineers at the request of interested parties, with a view to establishing the reality of discoveries made, and, as regards production, from declarations furnished by the proprietors with a view to the fixing of dues from the Mines.4. The &quot; Statistics of Mineral Industry &quot; (Statistique de lTndustrie Minerale) is published once a year. In addition to thisi, each Engineer furnishes at the end of the year to the Administration a report giving a resume of what has been produced in his sub-section during the past year. He furnishes a report on the same subject for the August Session of the General Council of each Department; the Tatter report is sometimes published either in whole or in part by the local newspapers.5. The above particulars refer only to the State Organisation.There exist, however, private organisations, the most important of which is the &quot; Coal Committee&quot; (Comite des Houilleres), which publishes each year a large number of circulars giving a great deal of information on the production, the method of working, &amp;c, in France and the French Colonies, as well as abroad.GERMANY.oIt is difficult to obtain, at short notice, reliable information as to the organisations existing in Germany before the war to collect information as to Mineral Resources and Production.The Imperial Home Office in Berlin collected and published statistical information as to mineral production throughout the German Empire in much the same way as the Mines and Quarries Department of the Home Office, London, does for the United Kingdom. The local Mining authorities appear to have published separately statistics as to the production of the individual states of the Empire.But the most comprehensive organisation for collecting information on metal.resources and requirements was the Frankfort &apos;&apos;Metallgesellschaft&quot; and &quot; Metallbank and Metallurgische Gesellschaft.&quot; On account of the widespread financial interests of these companies the Statistical Office maintained in connection there-with at Frankfort was able to obtain information as to production and consumption throughout the world, even in respect of firms which they did not control or in which they had no financial interest.An annual publication, entitled li Comparative Statistics of Lead, Copper, Spelter, Tin, Aluminium, Nickel, Quicksilver and Silver,&quot; was issued from the Frankfort Office ; English editions being distributed to the trade by Messrs. Henry R. Merton &amp; Co., Ltd., and the Merton Metallurgical Co., Ltd.The publication in question began with a review of the consumption of metals and movement of prices throughout the world for the past year, and there followed In respect of each metal a statement showing, for a period of 10 years back, the production, consumption, imports and exports of the principal countries of the world, followed, in those cases where the metal had a wide commercial, use, by an analysis of the consumption in the main groups of trades. Information,was also given .as to the capital, dividends and quotations of various Mining and Smelting Companies and as to the new issues and registrations of companies for the last three years.The compilers of the book obtained their information from a wide range of authorities, including Reports of Geological Surveys, Mines Departments, Import and Export Returns, Quotations of the World&apos;s Metal Exchanges, Trade Circulars, periodicals such as the &quot; Engineering and Mining Journal,&quot; Trade Societies such as the &quot; Copper Producers Association,&quot; and also very largely from producers and brokers associated with the Metallgesellschaft. -There seems, on the whole, little doubt that the Frankfort Bureau was run by private enterprise and was not in receipt 6f subsidies from the State. - It probably was in close relations with the Mining Depart-ments in the German Empire and received information as and when collected by those Departments, but does not seem to have had any official character. .ITALY.(1) Information and figures concerning :  -(a) The Mineral Resources ;(b) The Metal Requirementsare collected in Italy respectively through (a) The Reale Ispettorato per le Miniere ; .      .    -(b) The Ispettorato dell&apos;Industria et del Lavoro. ,Both are ^ong-established State Departments, the first of which is entrusted with the collection of all Statistical information and figures concerning the Mineral and&quot; Metallurgical capacity of the country, this including a complete record of the works, plant, labour, and financial sides of each undertaking, large and small.
The second Department is more specially concerned with the labour side and is entrusted with the application of all laws, bye-laws, and regulations in this connection ; also it is entrusted with the collection of data concerning the metal requirements of the country.(2) No information concerning other countries is collected or published by those State Departments, as all the information required in this connection pan bo easily obtained from private publications.(3) Tho organisation of the two above-mentioned State Departments, for the purpose of collecting information, is similar, and consists of a Central Head Office in Home, and of branch offices throughout the country. Each branch ofhco is responsible for a certain territory, and the Head of the Office inspects all the existing and new Works in his District. Mjno owners, plant owners, &amp;c, are under a big obligation to supply all figures for which they may be asked by the Inspectors.Complete information is sent periodically from the Branch Offices to the Head Office, and is there put into shape and published as a whole, at monthly intervals.Once a year all the information available in both Departments is put together and published (together with any other information on the subject which can be obtained from the private associations mentioned at No. 4) under the name of &quot; Annuaiuo Statistico Italiano &quot; which is a very complete Record of its type. (The last to be published during the War was in respect of the year 1915.) Over and above the Organisation outlined above, information is collected from the (a) Associations Metallurgica Italiana ; ( ) Reale Accademia delle Scienze ;(c) Accademia (lei Lihcei, ...which are private associations which may be partly subsidised, (a) is the most valuable private source of information and publishes a very valuable monthly Report.(5) No information is immediately available as to the cost of maintenance of these organisations.AUSTRIA.1. The organisations existing in the Austrian Empire for the purposes of collection of information as to the Mineral Resources and Production of the Empire appear to have been prior to the war : Statistischen Zentral Komission (Oesterreichische Statistik),The Imperial Mines Department. . &apos;The Mines Departments of the various State Governments.The Kaiserlich-Konigliche Geologische Reichsanstalt (Mineralogische Mittheilungen).2. The Statistischen Zentral Komission appears to have collected similar information in respect of other countries.3. The information was collected in the first instance by the subsidiary officers of the various Depart-ments concerned in the administration of the mining and customs regulations or the levying of taxes and duties in the different areas, districts or divisions. This information, having been tabulated in the head offices of the respective departments, appeared later in the official publications issued by the different central authorities of the parts of the Empire concerned. Subsequently the information was further classified, tabulated, analysed and epitomised, for publication in the Imperial Government Statistical Statements.4. As Imperial State documents the returns appear to have been issued annually, but information as to the exact periodicity of the subsidiary publications of the inter-State authorities is not immediately available.5, Detailed information as to the constitution and cost of maintenance of the various organisations is not available, nor whether such private institutions as existed apparently as commercial enterprises were subsidised by either the local authorities or the Imperial organisation.SWEDEN.1. The organisations existing in Sweden for the collection of information as to the Mineral Resources and Production are : . (a) The General Statistic Bureau.&apos;: (b) The Board of Trade (Kommerskollegium) Mines Branch,(c) The Geological Survey.(d) The Association of Mine Owners Bureau.2. The General Statistic Bureau collects similar information in respect of other countries, and publishes an annual report through the Ministry of the Interior.3. The information is collected through specially appointed officers, as regards the General Statistic Bureau, the Mines Branch of the Board of Trade and the Geological Survey, and through correspondents and technical publications by the Association of Mine Owners Bureau. Tho Statistics are required by the State for revenue and taxation purposes, and mine-owners are under legal obligation to supply figures of their production. *   . -4. The Statistical information relating to Mineral Resources and Metal Requirements is issued annually by the Board of Trade (Kommerskollegium) in the form of a publication entitled Bergshautering. The Geological Survey issues reports from time to time as well as annually. The Association of Mine Owners Bureau, in addition to the report issued for the information of members, furnishes a resume for inclusion in the Bergshantering of the Kommerskollegium.5. The Association of Mine Owners Bureau does not appear, to receive any subsidy from the State. The Departmental expenditure is covered by the Civil Service Votes, detailed particulars of which are not immediately available,, ,&apos; &apos;, ,0 4

The Statistics Bureau igsues an annual report which ranks tis the official statement of returns for alL industries throughout Norway.5. No private institutions appear to be subsidised by the State for purposes of collecting information as-, to Mineral Resources and Metal Requirements; the actual State expenditure for the various departments concerned is not immediately available. ;japan. ;1. The organisations existing in Japan for the purpose of collecting information as to the Mineral Resources and Production of the country are both State and Private Institutions.2. Similar information in respect of other countries is collected by the State Institution.3. For the purpose of collecting the information as to Metal Requirements and controlling the Mineral Resources, the country is divided into five districts, each of which lias its own system of inspection aud control; all of which are under the Mining Bureau of the Department of Agriculture aud Commerce. Infor-mation in regard to special interests is also collected by the Association of Mine Owners.4. The information obtained by the State organisation is made available in the annual report of the Dopartrrient. , .6. The cost appears to be defrayed out of ordinary State Expenditure as regards the Mining Bureau and the Private Institutions appear to be self-supporting.the geological survey of great britain and the museum of -       &apos; practical geology.The Geological Survey includes a Field Staff, a Petrographical Department, a Pateontological Depart-1 ment, and a Chemical Laboratory. The Museum includes a Library which contains more than 30,000 books relating to general and applied geology for all parts of the&apos;world, aud what,is probably the most complete collection of Geological Maps in existence. The Curator has the assistance of a mineralogist, and part of the services of the-palajontological and petrographical departments of the Survey. One of the most imuortant functions of the Museum is the exhibition of -mineral products from all parts of the world, with the special view of illustrating their application to industrial purposes. There are separate exhibits of colonial and foreign ores and minerals.  .The normal work of the Institution includes-1    (a) a detailed geological survey of the country on the scale of 6 inches to the mile, and the prepara-;;&apos;       1   -   ,/tion of. maps on the scales of 6 inches to the mile, 1 inch to the mile,   inch to the mile, and :&apos;.&apos;   &apos; -^tli inch to the mile. 1 . -J 1 .:,&apos;&quot;&apos;.&apos;(ft)&apos; the preparation of explanatory and statistical memoirs descriptive of The sheets of the 1-iueh map, and of more general memoirs dealing.with districts or.with subjects of special.economic, i   or scientific importance. : &apos;&apos;&apos;(fc) the examination of and advising upon boreholes made in search of coal, iron ore, water, &amp;c.(d) conserving aud exhibiting in the Museum rocks and fossils as the evidence on which the maps &apos;&apos;   &apos;   &quot;;      are founded, and economic minerals from all parts-of the world.&apos;&apos;     &quot;     &apos;&apos; &apos; Illustrating the applications of all mineral products to industrial purposes, , ... ,, - .   , (e.) giving information of a scientific character and answering inquiries upon economic subjects &apos;&apos;        connected with geology, such as water supplies, sites for. buildings, &amp;c, agricultural, building stones, road metals, the resources of ores and minerals.   The Library is open to the public during official hours. .     &apos; yfSince the declaration of war the normal work has been suspended in all regions except those of j special economic value and the work of the staff has.been mainly devoted to the preparation of a series of &quot;Special Reports on the Mineral Resources of Great&quot;Britain.&quot; &apos; &quot; !-&quot;       &apos; &apos;   - &apos;In addition to the work which is in progress in Great Britain, the services of - the staff are in frequent demand for inquiriesTelatingTo various parts of the British Empire.     , . .    ..The requirements of the Colonies as regards mineral matters were considered in formulating the organisation of the institution,, and in opening the Museum the Prince Consort, dn 1851, said &quot;It is r&quot; impossible to estimate too highly ilhe advantages to be derived from an institution like this, intended to &quot; direct the researches of science, and to apply their results to the development of the immense mineral &quot; riches granted, by the bounty of Providence to our isles and their numerous colonial dependencies.&quot; -      &apos; &apos;     The institution Originally included under one roof the School of Mines, the Mining Record Office, the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom, and the Museum of Practical Geology.

Published Work.   &apos;In 1860, a Report on tho Geology of Trinidad was published as a Geological Survey Memoir. In the Preface the Director General of tho Survey uses those words, &quot;By permission of His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, this Memoir is issued as the first of a series of geological treatises, illustrative of our West Indian possessions, tho Colonial Government defraying half the cost.&quot;In 1869 a report on tho Geology of Jamaica was published.In 1875, &quot; Report on the . . . Geology of British Guiana&quot; was published. This does not bear the heading &quot;Memoirs of the Geological Survey&quot; ou the title page, but has beon included siuco 1881 in the published List of Publications of the Geological Survey.Unpublished Reports, &amp;c,In 1876, on behalf of the Colonial Office au examination&apos; was made of Gibraltar for purposes of water supply.In ,1880, on behalf of the Foreign Offico, Cyprus was examined for the same purpose.In 1902, the volcanic phenomena in the West Indies were investigated for the Royal Society,In 1903, a member of the staff was lent to the Government of Trinidad for four years, another member to the Federated Malay States for three years, and a third left the staff ou his appointment as Director of the Transvaal Geological Survey.In 1905, a member of the staff was lent to the Crown Agents for the Colonies to report upon water for the Uganda Railway. An investigation of part of the gorge of the Zambesi was made on behalf of the British Association.In 1908, a member of the staff was lent to the Colonial Office for two months to report on the water supply of Cyprus. Another member of the staff was appointed Director of the Geological Survey of Southern Rhodesia.In 1914, a member of the staff, who had taken military duty, was reserved for geological work on the Western Front, and is still so engaged.In 1915, three members of the staff were similarly reserved for geological work in Gallipoli.In 1912, the Colonial Office Survey Committee included geology in thoir scope, and since then the Director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain has been a member of the Committee,In 1916, maps were prepared for the War Trade Advisory Committee showing the outputs and recorded occurrences of minerals of economic value in the British Empire.In 1914-17, a geological map of Belgium was prepared for the War Office by reduction from the large scale Belgium map, and reports were furnished to the War Office ou the water supply of Belgium, and on sources of road-metal, and other matters of a geological character. The Institution has been the headquarters for geological work by our own and colonial geologists when back from the Front, and by Belgian military geologists.Assays have been made of ores from Borneo, Central Africa, Australia, Cape of Good Hope, West Indies and Tasmania, and many other specimens from various parts of the world,, including Arctic and Antarctic regions, have been reported on, chiefly to the Colonial Office. Reports have been receutly furnished to the Colonial Office on proposals to bore for water in the Rift Valley of East Africa and at Sierra Leone.THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE.The Imperial Institute was constituted a Government Institution by the Imperial Institute Transfer Act of 1903, its principal duty being to promote by various means the development of the natural resources of the Empire. Under the Imperial Institute (Management) Act of 1916 the management of the Institute is vested in the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the actual government of the Institute being carried on by ah Executive Council of 25 members, including representatives appointed by the Governments of the Dominions,. India, and the Colonies. These countries, as well as the United Kingdom, contribute to the financial support of the Institute. In conducting the general business of the Institute the Executive Council is assisted by a Finance and General Purposes Committee and by other Committees appointed from its members. ,Advisory Committees have been appointed for each Domiuion and for India. These Committees include representatives with special knowledge of the trade and industry of their countries. Each High Commissioner in London is the Chairman of the Committee for his Dominion.Advisory Technical Committees, including commercial, technical and scientific specialists, have been appointed for various raw materials, including minerals.   The Mineral Resources Committee consists of :  Brigadier-General G. K. Cockerill, C.B. (nominated by the War Office).Sir Robert Hadfield, Bart., F.R.S., Past President of the Iron and Steel Institute ; President of the Faraday Society.Professor J. W. Gregory, F.R.S., Professor of Geology in the University of Glasgow; formerlyDirector of the Geological Survey of Victoria, Australia. Dr. F. H. Hatch, Ph.D., F.G.S., Consulting Mining Engineer; Past President of the Institution &quot;j- of Mining and Metallurgy.Mr. G. T. Hollo way, A.R.C.S., F.I.C., Consulting Metallurgist, Member of the Council of theInstitution of Mining and Metallurgy ; Chairman of the Ontario Nickel Commission. Sir Richard Repmayne, 1CC.B., H.M. Chief Inspector of Mines ; lately President of the Institutionof Mining and Metallurgy (nominated by the Home Office). The Rt. Hon. Lord Rhondda, lately Director, Cambriau Collieries, Ltd. Vice-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, K.C.V.O., K.C.I.E. (nominated by the Admiralty), Mr. W. J. Glenny, Commercial Intelligence Department, Board of Trade (nomiuated by the Boardof Trade). &apos;Professor Wyndhaji R. Dunstan, C.M.G., F.R.S., Director of the Imperial Institute.. Dr. T. A. Henry, Imperial Institute, Secretary. .   This Committee since its appointment has fully considered the operations of the Imperial Institute in connection with mineral resources, and has issued a Report and recommendations for future work.   The principal recommendations are : That the work of the Imperial Institute on minerals should be continued and extended in order toprovide for the supply of full information respecting the mineral resources of the Empire. That the staff eugaged on the several divisions of this work should be added to. o  5937 . D
That the present arrangements for communication and co-operation with Departments of Mines, &amp;c,overseas should be continued and. extended. That the articles on mineral resources hitherto published in the Bulletin of tho Imperial Institute.should in future bo published separately, aud that a Mineral Year Book giving statistical andother information on mineral resources should bo issued.The Committee further recommend that the work of the Imperial Institute should be principally directed to obtaining full information as to the mineral resources of the Empire, their extent and composition,, and to suggesting to the Governments concerned tho steps which should be, taken to develop mineral deposits of value hither undeveloped.The Committee consider that information1 as to now developments in processes of mining and metallurgy should be separately collected and published by co-operation between the special institutions and societies concerned with these subjects.Co-operation with the Board of Trade and with the Association of Chambersof Commerce.The Board of Trade nominates two representatives on the Executive Council of the Imperial Institute and the Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom one representative.In connection with the Imperial Institute Act of 1916, an inter-departmental Committee sat to arrange the respective spheres of work of the Board of Trade and the Imperial Institute in the supply of commercial intelligence respecting raw materials, including minerals. The principal recommendation of the Committee, which was accepted by the Departments concerned, was to the effect that enquiries and investigations relating to the sources of supply of the raw materials of tho Empire and their utilisation should be dealt with by the Imperial Institute.In order to facilitate the introduction into British commerce and industry of raw materials, including minerals, which have been investigated by the Imperial Institute, the Association of Chambers of Commerce has nominated representatives of the principal Chambers throughout the country to serve on the Raw Materials Committee of the. Imperial Institute, of which tile President of the Association (Sir Algernon Firth, Bart.) is Chairman The following Chambers are represented on this Committee : London, Manchester, Glasgow, Liverpool, Bristol, Norwich, Hull, and Middlesbrough.This Committee meets periodically at the Imperial Institute to consider reports and to advise as to the action to be taken in bringing new raw materials which have been examined and reported on by the Imperial Institute to the notice of merchants and manufacturers through the Chambers of Commerce, and by the publication of information in the journals of these Chambers throughout the country.Staff and Operations for Minerals.There is a special staff initiated under the Act of 1903 and now numbering 12 officers, with laboratories and assay rooms for mineral investigations, whether geological, mineralogical, or involving chemical analysis and assay, as well as assistants trained in the indexing and collection of commercial, statistical, and technical information regarding minerals and metals. All information collected is revised by the staff with expert kuowledge of minerals.The work done on minerals falls into three branches : Investigations, including analyses and assays, Intelligence and Exhibitions.Investigations.The investigations on minerals conducted at the Imperial Institute usually arise under four heads : (a) Minerals for which a market is required or concerning which special information is needed areforwarded to the Institute for report by the Mines Departments or other Government Departments in the Dominions, Colonies, and India.(b) The Institute directs the attention of overseas Mines Departments to minerals as to which theImperial Institute has received information that supplies are required in this country or in other parts of the Empire. This leads to the submission of samples for examination and valuation by the Departments consulted.(c) Minerals are received for investigation from special Surveys in overseas countries, whether &apos; carried on in association with the Imperial Institute or not.(d) Minerals are forwarded for report by private firms or persons in various parts of the Empire.The minerals received are first examined by the special staff in the laboratories of the Institute as to composition and quality, so that an estimate of value may be obtained in consultation with manufacturers, merchants, &amp;c. Full reports are forwarded to the Departments and correspondents concerned, with a request for any further information needed, such as extent of the deposit, names of producers, &amp;c. Finally, when information is complete, any necessary action is taken by the Imperial Institute to establish a market for the mineral by putting producers in communication with British buyers, who are supplied with full information respecting the mineral in question. In certain cases the Imperial Institute takes charge of and. supervises the sale on Government behalf of trial consignments of minerals.In the course of each year the Institute receives minerals for examination from nearly every country in the Empire. Thus in 1915 and 1916 minerals were examined from the following couutries aud reports ma(le: India, Ceylon, Sierra Leone, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Sudan, Somaliland, Uganda, East Africa, Rhodesia, Union of South Africa, Seychelles, Cyprus, Canada, Newfoundland,West Indies, British Guiana, Falkland Islands, Australia, Fiji, aud New Zealand.Mineral Surveys.There are a number of countries,, especially among the Crown Colonies and Protectorates, of which the mineral resources are little known. In some of these countries, in which there was reason to believe that minerals of economic importance occurred, the Imperial Institute has arranged with the Governments concerned for the necessary explorations to be made by competent geologists, with mining experience, specially selected for the purpose. , i
All minerals found by toe Surveyors are forwarded to the Imperial Institute for examination, assay, and commercial valuation, and any further explorations of tho deposits which prove to be necessary are thou arranged to he undertaken by the Surveyors. These Surveys were instituted by the Imperial Institute for the express purpose of ascertaining the existence and value of mineral deposits of probable commercial importance. It is not claimed that they serve the same scientific purpose as a Geological Survey, by which in certain cases they might be followed, but that they are most effective for their economic purpose, and it is clear that they migiit be extended with great advantage to several countries of which the mineral resources are at present not well known.Mineral Surveys have been arranged by the Imperial Institute in co-operation with the Governments in the following British countries : Southern Nigeria, Northern Nigeria, Nyasaland, and Ceylon.Imperial Institute Reports on the results of theso Mineral Surveys have been published as Parliamentary Papers for Ceylon (five reports, 1903-10) ; for Nyasaland (three reports, 1906-9) ; for Southern Nigeria (10 reports, 1903-13) ; and for Northern Nigeria (four reports, 1901-9).These Surveys have been conducted by officers selected by the imperial Institute, and have yielded results of great economic importance, such as the discovery of an important coalfield and deposits of iron ore &apos; ill Nigeria, coal and mica in Nyasaland, inonazite, thorianite, and other thorium minerals in Ceylon. With the exception of the irou ore deposit in Northern Nigeria, the development of which has been postponed by the war, all these deposits are, or are about to be, worked.Intelligence.Published information respecting new occurrences of minerals of. economic importance and new developments in their industrial utilisation is collected and arranged on a systematic plan, and the same course is adopted with regard to information periodically received from Departments of Mines and other Government Departments at home and overseas, and also from correspondents throughout the Empire. The Institute receives regularly the publications of Dominion, Colonial, and Indian Government Departments concerned with minerals and metals, and, as far as possible, similar publications issued by foreign govern-ments and by the various scientific and technical societies and also the technical and trade journals on these subjects. The whole of the indexed information is used in answering inquiries received at the Institute and in preparing reports on mineral investigations. The principal use is in the preparation of the special articles on Mineral Resources which are published in the Bulletin of the Imperial Institute, but which in future, as recommended by the Mineral Resources Committee, will be issued separately.These articles give a detailed account of the ores of each metal, notes on all the known occurrences of economic importance, particulars of deposits worked, notes of special mining and concentration processes, ^statistics of production for each country, prices of the ores, notes as to the quality of ore required, and such general information as is available with reference to methods of usage.The following are the subjects of the principal monographs on mineral resources which have been published by the Imperial Institute : Mica (1904). Chromium (1910).Diatomite (1905). Titanium (1911).Thorium minerals (1905). Bismuth (1912).Asbestos (1905 and 1908), Mercury (1913).Platinum (1906). Cerium earths (1914).Corundum (1906). &apos; Tin (1914).Graphite (1906). Beryllium (1914)..  Petroleum (1903) Zinc (1915 and 1916).Manganese (1907). Peat (1905 and 1916).Tantalum (1907). Nickel (1916).Molybdenum (1903). Queensland sapphires (1916).Tungsten (1909). Antimony (1916).Vauadium (1909). Cobalt (1916).Special attention is given to British sources of supply. Advance copies of these articles are furnished to the chief mining and metallurgical journals for review, and the attention of all merchants and manufacturers known to be interested is also called to them.A separate publication relating to the &quot; WorkTs Supply of Potash &quot; was issued soon after the outbreak of war, when the Impeiidl Institute received a very large number of enquiries as to sources of supply of potash. The edition of 1,000 copies of this pamphlet was exhausted soon after its issue. Similar publications on zinc, manganese, bauxite aud tin are now in preparation.The information on mineral resources thus systematically collected and indexed at the Imperial Institute has also been used for other important purposes, and especially in the last three years in answering enquiries as to ores made by the Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions and other Departments directly concerned with the war.The Institute nas prepared for the War Trade Advisory Committee a map showing the principal petroleum resources of the Empire, and is now revising for the same Committee a map showing the distribution within the Empire of mineral deposits of economic importance. The Institute has also compiled for the War Trade Intelligence Department a statistical and technical statement on the production and utilisation of certain metals and minerals in Germany before the war, and has been largely consulted by the Treasury, War Trade Department, War Trade Intelligence Department, and by other Departments concerned with the questions involved in dealing with&apos; contraband trade in minerals and metals and the issue of licences for the export of such materials.Exhibitions.The Institute maintains Reference Sample Rooms in which are shown samples of all raw materials, including minerals, which have been investigated at the Institute and as to which full information is available as to sources of supply, composition, uses and commercial value. These sample rooms have proved useful in dealing with verbal enquiries from nierchauts and manufacturers as to new sources of supply of raw materials within tho Empire.
In addition to this special exhibition of fully investigated raw materials, the Imperial Institute maintains in its Public Exhibition Galleries a comprehensive exhibition of tho chief raw materials, including minerals, of the Empire. This exhibition, which is in charge of a qualified staff, is arranged ou a geographical system, all the countries of the Empire being represented. The minerals and mining industries of these countries are well illustrated ; thus in the Canadian section there are exhibits of the chief minerals of the Dominion and other exhibits illustrating the uses to which they are applied in industries. For example, various grades of Canadian mica are shown together with specimens of articles manufactured with mica. The same applies to abestos, nickel, corundum, and&apos; other minerals.Minerals from countries overseas, for which a market is required, are brought to the notice of the Raw Materials Committee and through it to the Chambers of Commerce throughout the country, and similarly these Chambers through the Committee bring to the notice of the Imperial Institute minerals for which there is a demand in the United Kingdom.Co-operation with Overseas Departments.The Institute is in communication with the Departments of Mines and Geological Surveys in the Dominions (the communication being either direct or through the High Commissioners and Agents-General in London), the Colonies and India, and with the appropriate Departments in those Colonies aud Protectorates in which there is no separate Mines Department. From these Departments, the Institute receives publications respecting minerals and mines, with such statistics of production and output as are issued. The Institute also applies to these Departments for any special information that may be required, and as already indicated receives from these departments mineral for examinations and report, and also numerous enquiries for special information.The following is a list of the principal Departments in the Dominions, Colonies aud India with which the Institute is in communication ou the subject of minerals : Commonwealth of Australia : New South Wales     ----- Department of Mines.Queensland       ------ Department of Mines.South Australia ------ Mines Department.Tasmania -     -     -     -     - - Mines Branch of the Lands and Works Department.Victoria    -      -      -      -      -      -      - Department of Mines..Western Australia     -      -      -      -      - Department of Mines. Dominion of Canada : Dominion Department..... Department of Mines.Ontario     -      -      -      -      -      -      - Department of Mines.Newfoundland      -      -      -     -      -      - Department of Agriculture and Mmes.New Zealand --      -      -      -      -      - Department of Mines.Union of South Africa   ----- Department of Mines and Industries.-East Africa Protectorate       ...      - Commissioner of Mines.Rhodesia      -     -.....

Geological Survey.Ceylon......-      - Mineral Survey.Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements Government Geologist.Gold Coast   -     -     -     -     -     -      - Geological Survey.Uganda - -    .-      -      - Commissioner of Mines.The Imperial Institute is also in communication respecting minerals with various Departments of the following Governments: Bahamas. Jamaica.Barbados. Leeward Islands.British Guiana. Nigeria.. - British Honduras. Nyasaland.Cyprus. Seychelles.Egypt. - Sierra Leone.Falkland Islands. Somaliland.Fiji. Sudan.Gambia. Trinidad.Grenada. Zanzibar.Co-operation with Technical and Scientific Societies concerned with Mineralsand Metals.There are within the Empire a considerable number of scientific and technical societies concerned in the publication of papers bearing on the mineral resources of the Empire. The Imperial Institute exchanges publications with these societies, and indexes and publishes in its Bulletin abstracts of the more important papers.The Imperial Institute also prepared for the International Geological Congresses held at Stockholm and Toronto monographs on (1) the Iron Ore Resources of the British Crown Colonies and Protectorates, and (2) the Coal Resources of the British Crowu Colonies and Protectorates, which were published in the general reports issued by these Congresses on the iron ore and coal resources of the world.Members of the staff of the Imperial Institute have contributed numerous papers to the British scientific and technical societies concerned with mineral investigations, have served on the councils of some of those societies, and have taken part in the discussions which these societies have arranged in recent years on various aspects of mineral investigation, one of the most recent examples being a discussion on refractory materials at the Faraday Society.
