uuiuuel W. Dally J[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]*Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1918.SECRET.THE MUNITIONS POSITION AS AFFECTED BY THE PROSPECTIVESHORTAGE OF COAL.THIS matter is of serious importance. I suggest that it should be referred to the War Cabinet Priorities Committee without delay. I ask for a Cabinet decision in this sense.(Signed)        WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.June 18, 1918.The munitions situation of the Allies is for the moment good on the whole owing to the stocks accumulated for this year&apos;s campaign. But the attention of the War Cabinet should be directed to the fact that the position in 1919 is seriously menaced by the prospective shortage of coal on this side of the Atlantic. The Cabinet are familiar with the general situation. The following notes are exclusively concerned with its effect upon munitions : France.At the beginning of this year the French steel budget was cut by nearly 20 per cent, in view of the prospective shortage of steel. The output of field and 6-inch shell was reduced to tJO per cent, of requirements, 220 mm. shell reduced to 2 per cent, of last year&apos;s output, and the output of all shell of over 220 mm. calibre was stopped. Other users of steel were similarly rationed. M. Loucheur has been unable to meet the latest demand for an increased output of ammunition recently put forward by the General Staff as a result of the German offensive, and France will this year have to meet her needs out of stock, which will be exhausted by the end of the present campaign.The reduced programme requires 290,000 tons of steel a month, but in April only 224,000 tons were available from all sources, the French home output of steel having dropped by 25 per cent., largely owing to the shortage of coal from the Pas de Calais, following on the German advance.Italy.The present Italian steel budget is barely 60 per cent, of her requirements, but the 127,000 tons of steel a month needed for even this reduced programme has recently been met only to the extent of about 80 per cent. Whereas Italy turned out an average of 40,000 tons a month of pig-iron in 1917, she has only made 17,000 tons a month recently, owing to shortage of coal. Hence the Italian output of steel, which is largely made from imported scrap, has averaged only 80,000 tons per month since January, compared with 110,000 tons in 1917, and the figure will fall still further unless the pig-iron output can be increased. This has been supplemented by an import of 23,000 tons of steel a month, of which a small amount was from the United Kingdom and the greater part from the U.S.A. This brings the total up to 103,000 tons out of a minimum figure of 127,000 tons.This deficiency has most seriously affected the ammunition prospects. Italy&apos;s stock of completed ammunition at the beginning of May was slightly larger than at the same date last year; but whereas Italy had behind this stock a year ago an output of between 50,000 and 60,000 3-inch shells per day, her prospective output during the next three months is 20,000 shells per day. In order to maintain her position she is filling at the rate of 40,000 3-inch shells a day, but the stock of empty shell from which she is doing this is nearly exhausted. The effect of the steel shortage is equally serious as regards aircraft engines-an item in which Italy should be making a very important contribution to the Allied resources.   Her programme calls for an allocation
to the Aeronautical Department of 20,000 tons a month.  Iu recent months the Aircraft Department has been getting 5,400 tons a month.Unless we increase our allocation of both coal and steel to Italy, the situation, which is already acute, will become even worse, and our assistance should be given at once if we are to limit to harmful effects of the break in production which has already occurred.It is clearly desirable on financial and tonnage grounds that as far as possible Italy should draw supplies from America rather than from Europe ; but a considerable proportion of Italy&apos;s needs cannot be met except from this country ; and for the rest, we cannot afford to make Italy face the further delays which have hitherto been experienced in her dealings with Washington.Great Britain.During the last two or three months 75,000 coal-miners (Grade A men between 18i and 32 years) have joined the Army. In 19 L7 the output of coal per man per annum averaged 250 tons. The loss of 75,000 of the strongest workers is, therefore, &apos; likely to result in a reduction of output of at least 19,000,000 tons during the coming-year. At the same time as we are asked to face this reduction in output we are required to make additional allocations to the Allies of both coal and steel. We have already promised to increase our coal allocation to France and Italy by 11,000,000 tons during the coming year and our steel and pig-iron allocation to France by 83,000 tons during the next three months. Any increased allocations of steel that we make to Italy will be in addition.As regards home munition requirements, the effect of the German offensive has been to compel us to make very largely increased allocations of steel for railway construction overseas, and has led the General Staff to put up an increased ammunition programme owing to the unexpectedly large proportion of Tight calibre ammunition Avhich has been expended under the new battle conditions. The minimum programme which we are now asked to carry into effect involves an increased allocation to the ammunition factories of 200,000 tons of steel before the end of this year.In order to meet the increased steel allocations to the&apos;Allies, British munition demands, and the continually increasing Admiralty requirements for shipbuilding, it will be necessary to bring into operation the new steel works and coke oven extensions. This will require 4,500,000 to 5,01)0,000 tons of coal per annum, and is, in addition to the increased allocation of 11,000,000 tons of coal, already promised. Thus, against a reduction in output of 19,000,0.00 tons, we require an additional 1(),000,000 tons, giving a net deficiency of 35,000,000 tons on a total of about 250,000,000 tons. The industries generally engaged on the manufacture of munitions will have to bear the bulk of this reduction. The following table shows the consumption of coal during 1917, according to the purposes for which the coal was used: -Coal Consumption during 1917.Million tons.1. At collieries       .. .. :. .. &apos;.. .. ...   162. Gasworks. .. .. .. ,       .. .. .. 183. Railways .. .. .. .. .. .. 184. Iron and steel works, blast furnaces .. .... ..   315.

By reducing domestic consumption by 25 per cent., as compared with 1917, a saving of 9,000,000 tons could be effected, and possibly another 1,000,000 tons could be saved on the quantities used for haulage, &amp;c, at collieries, giving a total of 10,000,000 tons. The bulk of the remaining 25,000,000 tons will have to come from gasworks, iron and steel works, and general manufacture. To minimise the injury to munitions, further cuts should be made on domestic consumption, and the non-war industries must be more strictly rationed.(
