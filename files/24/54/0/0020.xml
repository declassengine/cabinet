(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

SECRET.

G.T. 4820.

WAR CABINET.

MEMORANDUM by Mr W. LONG REGARDING THE CIRCULATION OF WAR CABINET PAPER - No. G - 211.

I feel obliged to enter my protest in reference to the very unsual course adopted by Lord Milner in circulating a cabinet Memorandum (G-211) which is written by Mr Howard D&apos;Egville, who I understand, is attached to the War Cabinet Offices.

I have no comment to make on the Memorandum itself, but I must express my profound astonishment that Lord Milner should have thought it to be in accordance with the usual rules which govern the relation of colleagues to circulate a Memorandum dealing with my Department without even letting me see it in advance of asking whether I should have any objection to his circulating it. I venture to express the opinion that this is an unfortunate and undesirable innovation in our system of Government.
