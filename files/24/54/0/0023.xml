BATTLE SITUATION - EVENING - 12th JUNE 1918.

1. This morning, after an intense bombardment, the enemy attacked between AUTRECHES (north of the Aisne), and the  OURCQ. Between the AISNE and LONGPONT the enemy appears to have made progress and to have pressed back our line to the eastern edge of the LAVERSINE RAVINE - ST .PIERRE-AIGLE.

The enemy also attacked between CORCY and LONGPONT and succeeded in penetrating a short distance into the FORET-DE-RETZ, where it is believed he has been held.

North of the AISNE strong attacks developed about VINGRE. Those were repulsed. West of the OISE the enemy has captured BETHANCOURT, MACHEMONT, MELICOCQ, CHEVINCOURT,  MAREST-SUR-MATZ, and continues to exert pressure in this region.

The French resumed their counter-attack in the neighbourhood of BELLOY and COURCELLES this morning. Strong resistance was encountered and little progress made on the northern flank and east of BELLOY. Good progress was made on the main road east of MERY.

2. On the British front the situation remains unchanged.
