SUGARY OF OPERATIONS.for month of i&amp;y, 1918,BRITISH FROflT.On Liay 15th tho 13th Greek Division (CHALCIS) was placed under my command and on the following day proceeded by march route to tho 16th Corps area, where it wa3 concentrated in the neighbourhood of HIGRITA by the 24th.On the night 6th/7th May, after an artillery preparation during the day, one of our companies raided the enemy works south of DOIRAM with the object of destroying a PILL BOX and a large bomb proof which had previously been located in the work.   Both these objectives were reached with little opposition.   At the bomb proof 15 Bulgars opposed the raiding party with bombs.   Six of these were bayonettedj the remainder fled into the bomb proof v.rhere they were bombed.   A charge of explosive was placed against the face of the PILL BOX and fired resulting in the complete destruction of the structure.Prior to the above raid a demonstration was carried out against 0,2, (South of DOIRAIJ) with the object of inducing the enemy to believe that this was the main raid.    The demonstration appeared entirely successful as it brought down a heavy hostile barrage on 0.2.    Our casualties were very slight.- On the night 23rd/24th an operation was carried out against KRASTALI.    A small patrol entered the village from the south-west and killed one Bulgar.    As had been expected, a considerable party of the enemy then appeared from the west of the village to cut off our patrol.   Our main body, however, which was lying in wait, met the enemy with heavy Lewis gun and rifle fire inflicting considerable casualties.    As the enemy began to appear in large numbers on both flanks our patrol withdrew.    The casualties Incurred on our part amounted to 4 men wounded.On May 27th our artillery bombarded enemy trenches bet?jeen Lake DO IRAN and the R, VARDAR. Several large gaps were cut in the wire, and enemy dugouts and trenches In places were totally destroyed.During the night 22nd/23rd one of our patrols lay in ambush in KUHLI.   At 0530 a party of the enemy about 30 strong was seen approaching the village,   &quot;/hen about 400 yards from KU1ILI six enemy scouts were pushed forward and entered the village.   One of the enemy scouts was killed and three captured.    Our &quot;patrol then withdrew having suffered no casualties.No further actions of any Importance have taken place in the STRUHA valley although small patrol encounters have been of almost dally occurrence.AVIATION *     On IvSay 1st at 0630 hours 5 of our aeroplanes bombedbombs were observed to burst amongst twelve aeroplanes that were on the ground.   One hostile machine that attacked our formation was brought down JU. of VARDAR.   On May 4th an enemy aeroplane was brought down by two of our scouts and fell near DIOPTRIC, both the occupants (Germans) being killed.     On the same day anoth3r hostile machine was brought down Y.r. of Lake DOIRAN.   On Hay 8th 4500 lbs. of bombs were dropped during several raids on.DRAMA, aerodrome by machines of the R.A.F.   Considerable damage was inflicted on hangars and enemy machines on the ground.   On Hay 12th DRAMA, aerodrome wasagain bombed
again bombod by a Naval Contingent of the R&apos;*A&apos;.F&apos;,   One large Beee-aneau was observed in flames and two others were enveloped In smoke * Anti-aircraft fire was more intense than usual; however, all our machines returned safely.   On May 13th an enemy maohine was driven down and orashed near LIVTJNOVO, and on the 15th a further two machines were driven down emitting large quantities of smoke.On May 23rd at 0630. hours 27 of our aeroplanes bombed HUDOVA aerodrome, all bombs wore observed to burst in and around the hangars 6    Early on the morning May 24th an enemy aeroplane was compelled to land near KARA ORMAIT.    It was set on fire later by tracer bullets and bombs from our aeroplanes, and totally destroyed. During an aerial combat on Llay 23th an enemy machine was shot down in flames and crashed near VARDARHOE.    On the morning of May 30th our aeroplanes bombed HUDOVA aerodrome with considerable success. A hostile aeroplane was destroyed by a direct hit and a large petrol store was set on fire which when last seen was blazing furiously.During the period under review tho following dumps have been bombed almost daily - AHGISTA* KAKARA, SAVJAK, TUMBITZA and RUPEL*ALLIED FORCES.On May 15th French troops S.W. of Lake OHRIDA in co-operation with the Italians on their left, advanced and occupied the villages of PROTOPAPA, PULAHA, KARBAHJAS and TUZAS.    At the same time an advance took place along the main ridge S. of MOSICOPOLJE.   Progress continued and on the following day LAVDARI, MJSHACI and the heights to the South were occupied.    On 17th CAFA BECIT and MAJA FRAHKUT were captured.    The line now runs through PROTOPAPA, CAFA BECIT, MAJA FRAIOTT thence in direct touch with the Italian Army to the South.    French troops engaged consisted of Spahis, 58th Chasseurs a/p, and one Battalion of 372nd Regt. (57th Division) and two mountain batteries.On Hay 30th French and Greek troops carried put a very successful attack having as its objective the oapiure of the enemy positions from the SERKA di LEGBH to the heights to the East situated between the two branches of the LJUHNICA.Operations commenced on Hay 27th by an artillery demonstration by the British to the E. of the VARDAR.    This demonstration spread on the 28th to the enemy positions West of the VARDAR, to the S. of GJEVGJELI, and to the Serbian front in the seotor W. of TOTE and DOBRO POLJE.    The artillery preparation on the objectives coimuenced on the morning of the 29th and during that evening raids were accomplished by the British to the W. of Lake DOIRAH by the Serbians on the DOBRO POLJS; the Bulgars Suffered serious losses and several prisoners were taken.At 0455 hours on 30th, under cover of a powerful creeping barrage, the infantry commenced the attack on the SERKA, the first wave was composed of the 1st, 5th and 6th Regiments of the SERES and ARCHIPELAGO divisions; on the LJUMNICA heights the 7th Regiment of the CRETAN division was in the first line.    The 1st Regt* de Harche dfAfrique was In support of the 5th and 6th Greek Regts. The troops with fine dash carried all their objectives on a front of 12 kilometres to a depth of from ono to two kilometres.    The enemy put down a heavy barrage on the SERKA and In the afternoon attempted a counter-attack West of the SERKA which was completely repulsed./in spite of
a.In spite of a very bad light Allied aeroplanes took part In the attack, bombarding the enemy1s rear and using their machine guns from a very low altitude on the Bulgar reserves. During the night of 29th/30th and during the attack over three tons of bombs were dropped on MILETKOVQ and PARDOVICA stations, and on tho aerodrome at HUDOVA,The number of prisoners up to the time of writing amounts to 33 officers and 1712 O.R., also trench mortars and machine guns.   The Greek and French troops displayed great dash and their losses are extremely slight.The SERKA, from the enemy&apos;s point of view was a most important observation post and moreover its defences wore of great strength.   The steepness of the slopes and the great distance between the lines at many points increased the difficulties.I attach a map showing the area of the operations with the extent of the advance marked on it.ADMINISTRATION.Cold Storage.   The alterations to chambers at the NAOUSSA Brewery, SALONIKA, to render the latter suitable for storage of meat, are approaching completion, and it is estimated!that they will hold 240 tons of meat.Development of Local Resources.   DRANITSA Lignite Mine is opening up well and the Decauville to connect it with the Pier at EKATERINI is making good progress.HEALTH OF TROOPS. .1.
