^ab?^v (this document is the property of /        ,*\       his britannic malesty&apos;s government.)jailWAR   CABINETpropoe-ed Extension of the Munitions of War Acts to Crown Establishments.MEIORANPTM By the Secretary of State for War.I I desire to -support the proposal of the conciliation andArbitration Board in G,TC4547 that any extensions of the Munitions;  of War Acts to Government employees should not apply to the clerical classes.The difficulty arises from the definition in the Munitions of War Act 1916 of &quot;workmen&quot; as &quot;including net only persons whose usual occupation consists in manual labour but also foremen, clerks, typists,&quot;draftsmen, and other persons whose usual occupation consists wholly or mainly in work other than manual labour&quot;; and the Acts apply to&apos; such persons engaged on, or in connection with, Munition work6There is no satisfactory definition of munition work in departments outside the Ministry of Munitions, and it is therefore difficult to say exactly how wide the application of the Acts to the clerical class of Government employees would become under the new Bill.     But there seems no doubt that it would cover members of the higher grades of the Civil (Service as well as subordinate classes such as writers and book-keepers, with the result that, as the Memorandum of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board indicates, there would be no longer any logical line of demarcation between the Civil Service proper and the industrial employees of Government. I agree with the view expressed in that Memorandum that alternative (iii) of paragraph 5 is; the best course to adopt.     It speaks- of excluding &quot;clerks etc,,&quot;and it is not clear whether this is intended to cover foremen and &quot;draftsmen,     If there iB any difficulty about excluding such persons, who though no longer manual workers remain of the mechanical rather than the clerical class; I suggest that the exclusion should be limited to the clerical class only6MILKER.13th June, 1918.
