Si&apos;   i &amp;i Memorandum by the President of the f y*V oXfe&apos;&apos; Board of Trade. &apos;A.Ml ^J/liftRepresentations have been made to me by various classes of public utility undertakings - gas? water, tramways and electricity - that their financial circumstances have been so injuriously affected by ;1far conditions that it is necessary that some relief should bo given to then by way of increasing^ their statutory powers of charge or otherwise.The case of the gas undertakings has recently been consi-dered by a Select Committee of the nouse of Commons, who have recommended that some provision should be made for the tern-porary modification of&quot;statutory requirements with regard to price and dividend in the case of undertakings whose financial circumstances have been so seriously affected as to call for intervention and that whers the dividend of a Company has been reduced to one half of the standard or maximum rate or to one-half of its average dividend, calculated on the three years before the War. whichever may be the smaller, the Sliding Scale or maximum price should temporarily cease to operate, and the Company should be entitled to charge such price for gas as may be held by the Board of Trade to be sufficient to provide for the cost of manufacture and dis-trlbution and for a dividend at the rate of one-half the standard dividend or one-half the pro-war dividend, whichever may be tho smaller.The Committee recommend that provisions for inoreasing the price of gas should also be made in respect of Municipal Undertakings, but in their case tho increase of price should not exceed one-half the maximum price fixed for the under-taking.The Committee further recommend that these previsions should be carried into effect by general legislation and not by private Bills, and that they should have effect until one year after the termination of the War and till such fur-ther period as the Board of Trade may by Provisional Order determine.In the case of Tramway Undertakings another Select Committee of the House of Commons has recommended that the Board of Trade should be empowered by general legislation to permit the temporary modification of statutory requirements with regard to the charges for the eonveyance&apos; of traffic on tramways whose financial circumstances are proved to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade to have been injuriously affected by causes arising out of the to, and thai these modifications should have effect until twa years after the termination of the tosI propose, therefore, to introduce a Bill to give effect to tho recommendations of the 3elect Committees, and inasmuch as similar conditions obtain in respect of tfater and Electricity Undertakings I propose to make the provisions of the Bill applicable to those classes of public utility undertakings as well as to gas and tramway undertakings.A .H.STANLEY.20th June, 1918.Board of Trade.
