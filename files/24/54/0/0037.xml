In viIn view of the grave crisis on the Western Front I proposeto withdraw the following forces from Palestine to reinforce the forces in France.,(a) The 54th British Division, which can he landed in France by the first week in August,,(b) The Australian troops of the equivalent of one Mounted Division, which it should be possible to land in France shortly after (a).2,- After the withdrawal of these troops General Allenby willbe left with 6i Indian Infantry Divisions, and the equivalentoof one White and two Indian Mounted Divisions.   The comparative strength as between the enemy and ourselves is shown in the attached Table A0 (In this Table the British strengths are those computed on the assumption that re-organization now in progress is completed.)   It is not considered that this reduction will involve any risk that is greater than the necessities of the situation in the decisive theatre warrant us in taking.3, I shall be glad to have the War Cabinet1s approval of 4these proposals as soon as possible in order that the necessary arrangements may be put In hand forthwith,(Sd.)
