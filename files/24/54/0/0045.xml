She ilana hope that these iarports will enable them to carry on until next harvest.5SI?EAHK*.    11.11. Government teve Informed Washington that we should prefer to avoid any general Agreement with Denmark on tho terms eug-gestod last week by the Danish delegates at Washington.   She Danish Government, under pressure from Germany, unk loavo to retain 400,000 tons of shipping for Danish services;   and the United States War Srade Board are apparently willing that they should vobidu 350,000 tons. Even if they retain tho smaller quantity the Associated Governments would, lose about  00,000 tons of the Danish shipping which they at present control.   It might be worth while to allow Denmark some of tho raw materials which she requires on the understanding that the present arrangementb as rggarde shipping are indefinitely continued. If the United. States War Trade Board decide to conclude a general Agreement we think it important th&amp;t they should sanction no imports into Denmark of feeding stuffs, cereals or fertilisers.   Such imports would necessarily increase the supplies of agricultural produce avail-able for Germany.   We should be prepared to share the Danish surplus %&apos; of such produce with the Central Bmpires.In default of a general Agreement the Danes may lay up their ships.   iVe should not propose in th5&amp; event to requisition them ira-mediately, as the Germans might retaliate by some invasion of Danish neutrality;   but the ships would still be available for use in Allied services in an emergency.We have offered to purchase our full share of the Danish but-tor surplus&apos;up to July 1st;   hut the difficulty as to price still remafje The Danes refuse to lower their price below 375 I r. per owt.   Wo are
not prepared to pay wore then 380 Kx. and oven then we propose, in. compensation, to increase the prloe of our coal to Ztanaark*   The Danes have suggested that in return for lowering the price of their huttor we should allow them to import limited onantitles oi raw mat-oriaia,   They cannot continue to storo their butter indefinitely; and thoy have already foegtm to export the British sins:re to Go many and Isaniinavta in the proportion of two to one,   During the let woek of June Germany received m extra 1,200 casks.BOSffAY.    The Norwegian Government are disc oncer tod to learn that the United States Authorities propose to refer all Norwegian applioa-fcions for export licences to the allied Blockade Committee in London,, They urge that the Allied Trade Committee in Christ Iania should have full powers to grant or to refuse the applications upon receipt of the necessary guarantees from the Horwegi&amp;n Associations,* -NKTFr^HLAllBS^   We have informed the Netherlands Sovernment that the Cargoes&apos;on board the Dutch vessels recently requisitioned in British Ports may be shipped to Holland at once, if vessels are sent from Holland to fetch them,   Tho cargoes of coal pitch, phosphates-and pyrites will, however, be requisitioned by H*M, Government owing to our urgent need of these commodities4   Consignments of caeca beans, oil o&amp;fco, cinchona bark, pepper, vegetable seeds and orange peel will also be retained as these commodities arc either under embargo, or form the subject of disputes between H.M. (JOY&amp;riuaeat and the He the rleud s C-ove rumen t *As the result of recent diooueaions with the German as regarding the old $ernaxt Dutch Agreement the Dutch have agrecfi to resume the export of horses to Germany,   It is believed that they will send at la&amp;st 8,500 foals to Geriauuy under this KTxmipnvm%*   Sir     Townle$r has protested against these exports which we regard as a broach of the Angb-Dutoh Hides Agreement.   The Dutch have also agreed to send further supplies oi&apos; cheese- and bone fat to Germany under the
old Agreement.

The Allied percentage will consist wholly of condensed milk, while the Gorman shere will consist mostly of cheese.   The Swiss milk surplus can hardly he very considerable during the coming year. The Hestle Company have already been obliged to close two of their factories and to suspend, altogether the production M unsweetened condensed milk as they have been required to reserve Isrge quanti-ties of fresh milk and butter for the federal Milk Office.M. Schulthese refused at the last moment to guarantee that the Swiss exports of cattle to Germany under the Genaan-Swiss Agree-ment would not exceed 20,000 head, but he hag given an assurance in writing that the exports during the eight months covered by the now Agreement will not be allowed to exceed the export -for a correspond-ing period tinker the old Agreement unless the Allies hove been previously informed and consulted.o 03SRKAH SPBKABIWB BL0QKAP3.
