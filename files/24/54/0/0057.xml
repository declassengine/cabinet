Admiralty, S.W.

15th June, 1918.

Sir,

I am directed by the Allied Naval Council to acquaint you, for the information of the Supreme War Council, that, at the Fourth Meetings of the Allied Naval Council, held in London on June 11th and 12th 1918, the following Conclusion was reached with regard to the situation at Murmansk and Archangel.

CONCLUSION.

LXXII. - THE PRESENT POSITION AT MURMANSK AND ARCHANGEL, AND IN FINLAND.

The Allied Naval Council, having discussed the recent developments in the position, and considered the Report of the Sub-Committee appointed by them to consider all the documents relating to the Naval situation at Murmansk and Archangel, takes note of the statement of commitments set out therein, which appear to be:-

(a) The supply and maintenance of a force amounting perhaps to 26,000 men at Archangel and Murmansk collectively;

(b) The retention of the present Allied Naval forces in those waters; and

(c) The probable feeding of the civil population of Murmansk and Archangel districts.

It is not the function of the Allied Naval Council to provide transport, but to guard it and to safeguard the sea routes, and before undertaking to do this the Council consider it is desirable that a statement of the volume of traffic to be safeguarded should be set out by the Military Authorities.

The Allied Naval Council furthermore wish to place on record that their resources for convoying and safeguarding Maritime traffic are strained to the uttermost, and that heavy troop movements such as are now going on, both in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, make demands upon those resources which can only be met by diverting craft either from the convoying of Merchantmen, with resultant increased losses which are now discernible, or by depleting the offensive hunting forces against submarines which involves a loss in the destruction of submarines and a consequent increase in the enemy&apos;s offensive powers. The policy of the
Allied naval Council is to concentrate iA*)-T?tooClA of their as far as way bo upon -certain.areas &quot;/hero enemy fcnibixij^i&amp;as arc-oentrated, such as the waters of tho Irish Sec, the English $jjl and tho Western mouth of the same, - -and in the Straits of 0treat! and elsewhere.    The dispersion of foroos necessary&apos; in order toL safeguard the northern routes to Murmansk and Archangel is uniw^f irablo from a strategic point of view, mid can only bo Just if jjT if tho results to be obtained by .tho military effort in the MuJ monsk and Archangel districts are adequate.     In regard to thijl tho.allied Haval Council-, havo no , knowledge,; and they submit to[ Supromo Tar Council, that it; is in the allied interest that m decisions such as the one taken &quot;at the Sixth Session of the sJ &apos;7ar Council., of increasing Forces at Murmansk arc dpfinitoly col eluded, the Allied tfaval Council should be.given an opportunity expressing their views. . -  &apos;&quot;71th reference to the final recommendation contained in j last paragraph of Joint Koto Ho.31 of tho Military Represent^ at Versailles, under which it was proposed by tho Military Repr 8&apos;ont.vtives, and subsequently confirmed by tho Suprome &quot;ex Cornis that the Uaval and Military warfare in the Artie Ocean should \ placed under one Commander-in-chief - presumably a Military Of! - it appears that this an undesirable arrangement, and is no&apos; accordance with pas l- practice in il aval warfare. It is, the j, Haval Council submit, impossible for a- Military - Commrjider-in* C: adequately to command the Llaval Operations&apos; on account&apos; of his :i of knowledge on the subject, and such a course would remove tlif responsibility for $aval Operations in that area from the vari Chiefs of the $aval Staff of the various Countries concerned aj the rpspoctivo Ministries of Marino.&apos; ,They therefore venture to re-submit this question for tho consideration of the Supreme &quot;Tar&apos;&apos;Council, and recommend&apos; that $ decision on this,point should bo: that ono - Commando i?-n-Ghaef should command all.. Military Operations, and ono IT&amp;ivJ,&apos;. &apos;;cf:?mandd . in-Chief she aid command all naval Operations, or. - &quot;ho &apos;.q7&amp;\ :-.i&apos;vlM understanding tha t tho c lo s o s &apos;c:&apos; e o- operation shoaad ox? si- boMvcfl the two and that all naval&apos;- for&amp;cs when operating on xanA She-rjJj under the general orders of the-Military Commandor-in-Chief,As regards the possible future of those Military OpcratioJ on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, the Allied Iaval Council is strongly of tho opinion that no increase. An&apos;the numbers so fur oidod upon by the Supreme war Council should take place withoiil full and careful consideration .of the -Uaval consequences,, or v/J. out the advice of a responsible Allied 1Javal Authority. &apos;&apos;I am.
