XIq, the undersigned Committed, appointed by Your Lcjrdenlpa&apos;&apos; minute of the 18th February I9l8, for the purposes therein mentioned, beg to submit our report to Your Lordships.We have hdld fourteen meetings and have takon evident from the Right Hon. Winston Churchill, M.P., theRight Hon. E.G. Pretyman, M.P., Sir L. WortMngton Evans, Bart4, M.P., ^ Itolohel G.P. Collins, C.M.G., M.P,&apos;, Rear Admiral H.H.D, Tothiil, C.Bff Fourth Sea Lord, Mr. Andrew Weir, Member of the Army Council and ; Surveyor, General of-Supply, Sir John Mann, K.B.E., Director General of Munitions Contracts, Sir Harry Livecey. K.B*B.. Acting Director of Navy Contracts, Mr, Sherlock and Colonel Fletcher, representing the Air Board, Mr, W. L, Hlcliens of Messrs. Cammo 11,Laird &amp; Company, Limited, and Mr. Herman Lebug, Contractor to the War Office and Ministry of Munitions.2,        We understand that there arc at present about fifteen Government Departments doing, to a greater or less extent, their own independent purchasing, including such large purchasers as the Ministry of Munitions, the War Office, and the Admiralty - who between thejh enter into contracts for upvmrds cf  900,000,000, a year at present     and the Air Ministry (supplied, partly through the Admiralty, War Office and Ministry of Munitions), Intod Water Transport, Military Railways, India Office, Office of Works,MIMstry of Pood and Post Office,    This system of competing purchasers is&quot; an inheritance from pre-war conditions;   and under such conditions the objeotiors to the system were not serious or obvious, as competl-tion amongst the supplying firms enabled the competing departments to buy in the cheapest .marketa.The war has completely changed the position, adding to &apos; the nuinber of purchasing departments and increasing demand enormous? ly, while at tho stoe time rendering supply very difficult.    The defects inherent in the present arrangements may be summarised as follows;-(a) Departments in the first place aim at securing their requirements irrespective of those N*btner departments. No doubt they endeavour to buy at reasonable prices, that is, prioOs&apos; allowinga fair margin of prof it to the contractor, but the views of the various departments differ as to the amount of profit which it is reason-able to allow, and as to the best forms of contract to be adopted. These differences must involve In some oases unnecessarily^hlgn prices being paid to contractors. &apos;   Serious attention was drawn to this question before the Seloct Committee on l^enditure.    Uniform principles should clearly be adopted by all departments,    mter^ departmental meetings of the Contract Officers have so for achieved ^little improvement in this respect.(b) We are Informed that there is a similar want of uniform? Ity (though reduced to some extent by the Inter-departmental Costings Committee and the Central Register of costs investigations) as regards -costings methods.
This moans that one department secures loss control over prices than another.    It also mo ana that a Contractor, having fought for a particular method with one department, has tho trouble of fighting it over again with other departments.(c) Contractors are at present free to delay production by refusing ono Government job and waiting for another, possibly more lucrative.    Although this defect is partly remedied in one instance by an arrangement between- the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions for allocating particular firms to particular work, clearly: there . should bo some general machinery for securing that each contractor shall do what Government regard, him a3 best fitted to do.(d) Although there has boon considerable Improvement in the matter of overlapping, and various inter-departmental joint buying or Joint consultation arrangements are now in fojtoe, it is still true that two or more departments, or ovon brandies of departments, are buying the some or very similar articles independently.   This means in some cases that they&apos;are competing for tho services of the same contractors (already fully employed perhaps on Government work), and paying different prices for tho same or similar articles;   and we are told that they even employ their own &quot;hastoning&quot; staffs for securing that a contractor turns out their own particular work before that ordered by another department or branch.    As an extreme case,&apos; Woolwich Arsenal has been found to be obtaining nail pullers at Woolwich at a higher price than that offered at the same time by the War Office to a country firm elsewhere, and inthis instance tho pullers wore actually supplied to Woolwich indirectly by tho country firm, who, as a result, delayed thoir lowor-pricod contract for the War Office.     In the case of tho Air Board, very considerable purchases of common articles are made locally, apparently without consultation with other departments.(e) It follows from this that there must be a number of isolated stocks of the same or similar articles inmrious parts of the country and under different control.    If there were unified control over these stocks it should result in a more efficient staff and speedier deliveries of goods, and also in a reduction Of&quot; total quantities and therefore less expense in staff, buildings and capital outlay.    It would also tend to socure a more effective check on the demands made by spending departments and a more regular programme of supply.    And a central storekeeper, having &apos; a much,;larger turnover, could save railway romovals, etc. by keep^ ing local stocks of&apos;components.(f) The number of Government Inspectors and their travel-ling expenses, could be reduced if the dpoartmonts did not inspect independently .And one inspecting staff would be much more conveni!! ent for contractors.    ?le&quot;were informed by one witness that twelve Government Inspectors were found to be employed the other&quot; day for different departments in a Factory employing only 1000 men.(g) The same remarks apply to the various costing staffs. One Government staff could do their work more easily and efficient-ly and would cause&apos;less trouble to contractors;   c.g., they could survey a firm&apos;s results as a Y7hole if it was entirely employedon Government work, instead of examining the costs piecemeal.
(h) Tho independent Departments tend to have small differences in patterns and specifications., some of whichare probably unnecessary.   Such differences coat money, and they could probably bo reduced to a considerable extent; e.g. the War Office found it possible to reduce wool patterns from some dozens to three whan they took ovor the control of all wool for tho Government,(i) At present a Contractor may have a long and oxhaust-ing dispute over prices with one Department and thon havo to discuss the 3ame mattor fall over again with another.(j)   There is a lack of co-ordination in labour policy, as regards both rates of pay and transfer of staff from one Department to another.   This is so both in London and in tho country.   The Second Report of tho Expenditure Committee drew attention to this mattor as regards local labour hired by tho War Office and Admiralty.   V/e understand that the        increase recently allowed by the Ministry of I anitions necessitated re-visions of pay at the War Office end Admiralty, and that the now arrangement undor which the Ministry of labour is to approve all war increases of pay will probably only secure co-ordination as regards general large increases.   Different Departments therefore will still tond to compete for labour, and outbid one another, to some extent.(1)   The difficulties of allocating between the competing Departments certain material of which there is a shortage, have necessitated t&amp;o setting up of a Cabinet Priority Com-mittoe.   Much time is spent in discussions before this Committee. Contractors complain that allocation is sometimes made without full knowledge of their requirements for Government work. Unified control over the Supply Departments would simplify this part of the work and reduce to some extent the amount of dis-cussion required.(m)   Hone of tho Supply Departments have a comprehensive enough survey to be able to consider certain post-war problems properly; e.g. one Department should havefCull knowledge of all Government requirements and stocks etc. so as to be able to decide, e.g. what can be spared for the use of the private trader after the war, and should have Complete knowledge of all branches of trade, so as to be able to advise as to the neoeseary key industries etc. and their needs.(n)   There should be one policy for all Departments as re-gards the terms on which materials are supplied to contractors, it present we understand that materials are sometimes supplied free, sometimes at reduced prices and. sometimes at the full cost.(o)   The existence of so large a number of separate buying staffs must mean unnecessary expenditure on salaries.   Moreover v/e have been told that the buying staffs are to a large extent divided, not scientifically according to the articles purchased but according to the Departments purchasing.   Instead of one highly expert Branch (containing the very best experts of the trade concerned) controlling all the trade in each article, there are a number of less expert Branches in different Depart-
m    4:    **menta dealing in the same or similar articles without the necessary comprehensive knowledge and control.   And these separate branches cannot preserve real continuity in production or share out the work fairly amongst the different contractors.3.   Most of the points of criticism referred to above are clearly serious, and at an early stage in our enquiry m came to the conclusion that, in view of the magnitude of the Government expenditure and the possible duration of the mr, it would be very desirable to introduce some really effective change in existing arrangements -with a Tier/ to controlling prices and securing co-ordination.Had the length of the war, and the extent of the demand for war supplies been foreseen, a central buying organisation for all Departments, would probably hare been set up at the outbreak of war and would have secured both increased efficiency of supply and also substantial economies.   At the present stage, when the various departments have developed and secured experience, and when their intromissions are so gigantic, a large amalgamation scheme is undoubtedly more difficult, and for that reason we have carefully considered possible alterna-tives to central purchase.   In view of the possibility that the war may still last for a considerable period, we believe it would be well,, even at this late stage, tg form a Central Executive Ministry of Supply, if a Supply&quot;Minister with the necessary knowledge and personal qualities could be secured, but in a later portion of our report we suggest what we consider would be the best alternative to this proposal should the establishment of a comprehensive Supply Ministry be found impracticable or inexpedient at the present time.   In our opinion the responsibilities of Supply Minister could only be undertaken successfully, and adequate results secured, if a business man of exceptional force of character, and with a thorough first hand knowledge of the existing business arrange-mefita of one or more of the large War Departments, was appointed to the post.   Under this proposal the Ministry of Munitions would practically be expanded to include in its sphere all Government purchases except food and such highly technical supplies for the Navy as could not safely be entrusted by the Board of Admiralty to any independent authority.   The Minister of Supply could operate at the outset through the agency of the existing Departmental staffs and without disturbing their work, and could gradually introduce improvements and economies as he saw his way.   The change should therefore- not involve any risk of a breakdown in supply, and it would not be nec-essary to create any new Departmental staff.The Board of Admiralty oppose the creation of a Central Supply Ministry on the ground that (1) they could not devolve their responsibility for technical war material on to any department outside their own control. (2) the proposed central Department would be too unwieldy, (3) it would become too strong for the fighting Departments responsible for supply, (4) consultation inside the same office between the adrainistra-tion and the purchasing agent would no longer be possible and (5) economy i3 doubtful.
Q 90 6So far as technical supplies, ships and overhauls to ships are concerned, we entirely agro^ with the Admiralty view that tho responsibility for contracts should not be en-trusted to an outside body., and we therefore propose that the Supply Ministry should not deal with such contracts. This objection, however, does not appear to us to hold as regards general non-technical stores, and in our opinion there can be little doubt that as regards such stores the &apos; interests of economy would be served by central supply and that the difficulties referred to by the Admiralty could easily be overcome by an efficient Minister of Supply. The views of the War Office, the Minister of Munitions and the Air Board,as represented by the witnesses who gave evidence before us, are unanimously in favour of a Central Supply Ministry*4*    As we have explained, however, we consider that only a man of very exceptional qualifications could manage the business of central purchase with success;   and in view of the difficulties that might arise in connexion with a change in administration at the present juncture, or in case the Govern-menfc should find themselves unable to secure a suitable man, or other difficulties should prevent the adoption of the scheme, we recommend the following alternative proposal as going a long way towards securing a remedy for the defects of the existing arrangements s-(1)   A Standing Committee to be formed consisting of the heads of tho Contract Departments of the Admiralty, War Office an$ Ministry of Munitions (and Air Ministry, should they have a separate Contract Department) with an independent Chairman. This Committee to meet at once and agree upon general lines of procedure to be adopted forthwith by all the Departments as regards (a) the control of contractors1 profits, (b) forms of contract (including the question of break clauses.), methods of costings and arrangements for joint inspection where possible,--and for avoiding overlapping costs-investigations, (c) the charges to be made for materials supplied to contractors, (d) arrangements for reducing the amount of sub-contracting&quot; as far as possible and controlling sub-contractors&apos; profits and the profits of main contractors thereon, and (e) the avoidance of overlapping purchases of the same or similar articles by different Departments, whether centrally or locally,   The Committee to meet thereafter at least once a week to introduce such improvements in procedure as may be found possible from,time to time-    Thoy should be supplied each week for their information with complete lists of all con** tracts (central and local) made during the previous week by all Departments;   together with a statement of the agreed prices and the previous prices for the same or similar articles, and the names of the new and previous contractors and tho basis on whioh the price was fixed.(8)    A similar Committee, consisting of the heads of the four Store Departments, and under the same Chairman^ to consider Government stores generally with a vlow to (a) suggesting reductions in the number of patterns as far as possible, (b) investigating overlapping stocks of similar stores, so as to reduce capital expenditure and. keep new contracts steady by cutting down all unnecessary surpluses existing anywhere, (c) bringing, and keeping, all store returns and statistics absolutely up to date, and placing them at the disposal of each Contract Department so as to enable it to forecast requirements, and (d) introducing such economies in storekeeping as may bo possible.
It would be for the Chairman to work out his own scheme for scouring the,information ho required from tho various do-.: purtmonte to onublo him to socure co-ordination.&apos;   Ho should&apos;&apos; have a competent Secretary to assist him.It would bo important, while haying regular mootings   . every week, to avoid lengthy meetings of tho Committees so as not to interforo unduly with the members,&apos; ordinary duties. Tho functions of tho chairmen would bo puroly of a co-ordinating and suggestive character, without tho power of interference with the various departments, as suoh interference might conceivably load to friotion and dolay.    His aim would be to &quot; get the various deportments to improve thoir practice and work in unison.    In tho evonjti of there being an important divergonoo of opinion on any material point ho should have power to rofor tho auostioh to tho Minister in oharge of the Department eon-cerned, and thereafter if necessary to the War Cabinet.This alternative scheme of co-ordination by Committee would probably bo loss effective than co-ordination by a responsible Minister of Supply.    But &quot;wo propose its adoption, as the best alternative, in tho event of its boing found impossible to create such a Ministry. .&apos;. ,5.   Wo havo referred above, in paragraph 2 fa), to the different-views obtaining in the various Departments on the question of tho profit which may reasonably bo allowed to contractors, and to tho desirability of securing a uniform practice on the point.    It is practically impossible to lay down hard and fast rules as to what may be regarded as a reasonable profit, and wo make no attempt to deal in this report with all tho considerations involved;   but some approxi-mation to common agreement should be possible on many points, and wo dosiro to draw special; attention to the following questions(1)   10% on turnover was in practice rogardod - speaking vory generally - as a reasonable profit to a contractor in many normal oasos before the war (subject of course to numerous exceptions).    But when wages and tho cost of materials riso as thoy havo acwodttmr, the aamo 10$ on the resulting total expenditure means in many instances a considerable increaso in the amount of the contractors profit, while tho increase in his capital may not have been correspondingly large nor the work involved by the particular contract greatly inoroasod. Even though tho contractor, may claim that some inoroaso in tho amount of profit is fair in view of the lower valuo of monoy, yot it appears clear that in so far as 10$ (or any other pcr-contago). on turnovor was regarded as reasonablo in particular instances boforo tho war, tho same percentsagc must in many oases, for ttm reasons which we havo stated, be too high noWf In some distances Departments appear to bo acting on this conclusion, but it should be possible to save large sums if this revision of practice was introduced generally.(2)   War Offico regular practice is in favour ef rec-tricting.the percentage on turnovor or on sale price according to tho relation between tho capital employed and the annual turnover and also to tho pro-war rate of profit,.    Wo aro informed that the adoption of this practice has introduced substantial economies without oausing dissatisfaction to contractors, and that in a number of instances the offoot has. been that the contractor has received only Zfo to bfo on turnovor.    The practice, docs not appear to prevail gonor-v ally in all Departments.
There are of course liffaculties ^in^applyija^ this practice; e.g. some firms or Companies may have a small capital and a well-equipped artd well^-organised establisljiaeirt^^ while others may ha-ve a large capital unprofitahly laid out and their works indifferently organised,     But if., as we understand;, the War Office working rule , as stated above, takes account of such differences, we suggest that immediate steps should be taken to revise arrangements on something like this basi3 in all Departments060   In conclusion we desire to add that our attention has been drawn to the fact that the Air Board are considering^ a proposal for establishing yet another independent^Contracts Department, for obtaining not only supplies (other than aeroplanes) peculiar to the Air Board but also such common\ articles as they may be unable from time to time to obtain from other Departments,     Incidentally we were ,inilt)rmed that*-the Air Board have been making local purchases to the extent . Of about  500j000 a year for various articles, involving a certain amount of overlapping with other Departments,The representatives of the Board who gave evidence before us stated that the proposal for a new Contracts De-partment would be unnecessary if a central Supply Ministry&apos;&quot; were set up or if the Ministry of Munitions could establish a special branch of their Contrac-ts Department to deal witli^. general. Air Board supplies and to be housed in the Board&apos;s Offices0     We hope that the &quot;needs of the &quot;Board may be met in one or other of these two ways, as it would be very undesirable in our opinion to set up a new independent. Contracts Department,,We desire to place on record our appreciation of the valuable assistance we have received from Mr. Stocks, the Secretary; in all our deliberations and in the preparation pf this report.INCHCAPE   (Chairman)tP.
