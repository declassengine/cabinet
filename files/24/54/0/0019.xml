SECRET. $yU**w*Document is the Property of His. Brfrbtes&amp;e Majesty^ Government.)PRIORITY-AND ALLOCATION OB1 MATERIALSIN THE POST-WAR PERIOD.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.&apos;1.I am circulating herewith a copy of a Report submittedby my Advisory Council upon the subject of the machinery appro-priate to priority and the allocation of materials after the war and, so far as may be necessary, during the war in connection with post-war plans.war there will be a shortage of certain commodities;   but the Council has not attempted to investigate either the number of such commodities or the probable severity of the shortage in    ^ them.    The Report has been submitted to the consideration both of the Board of Trado and of the Ministry of Munitions, and thest two Departments have expressed a general agreement with the brcat principles outlined in it*X in my opinion this Report furnishes a suitable basis upon which to build up gradually a machinery for determining pott-war questions of priority and allocation, which will safeguard the needs of the country without imposing an undue burden upen the industry/affected,     I attach partleulaj importance to the fact that the Report recommends in the main modifications and readjustments of the existing organisatione:-   Upcn one point of detail the Report needs correction.,     It is assumed on page S that the Joint Priority Board, which was in process of formation when the Report was drafted, is in actual existence.    The question of creating such a Board is still undei consideration.The Roport is based upon the assumption that after the/rather
rather than the establishment of new machinery.3. The Report proposes that there qjimild be a CentralAuthority consisting of:-(i) A Cabinet Committee oh the lines *f the present War Priorities Committee of the War Cabinet to determine broad ! questions of policy and to act as a Court of final Appeal.(ii) A standing Council on the lines of Ihe existing Permanent Sub-Committee of the War Priorities Committee, to investigate and advise the Cabinet Committee upen all questions of priority and allocation, and to make block allocations of materials;   this Council to consist of representatives of Government Departments together with representatives of industry and commerce.(ill)   Trade Organisations representative of the differs. industries, including both labour and capital, to deal with detailed allocation.(iv)   A Miscellaneous Traces Board to allocate material . to trades not sufficiently important to have Trade Organisations  j of their own.4. Following these general lines of suggestion I desireto submit for immediato consideration the following proposalsThe War Priorities Committee of the War Cabinet should. I think, have attached to it (under the same Chairmanship) a Poet-War Priority Section, consisting of the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Reconstruction, and the Minister Of Labour.    The War Priorities Committee and this Post-War Priority Section would then constitute a Cabinet Committee such as the Report contemplates, competent to deal not only with present questions affecting war industry but with matters of post-war policy also.The existing Permanent Sub-Ccmmittoe of the War Priori-ties Committee is so composed that it would, in my opinion, not/be
pro J 6be pcsaiblo, by the mere addition of one or two members of Government Departments, to make it a body suitable for dealing with , ,st-war problems.    I fr &quot;T ^erefore that there should at once be created independent of ihia Committee a Standing Council such as is outlined in the Report.    This Council should) in my view, comprise representatives of the Board of Trade\ the Pr-lerity Department, (whether as ncw; attached to the Ministry ef Munitions, or what weld be preferable as a branch of a War Priorities Department) the Ministries&quot;of Shipping, Labour and Pood, a representative of the Civil Industries Committee nominated by the Ministry of Reconstructten, and the Secretary j;of the War Priorities Committee *    In the event of the Priority Department becoming divorced from the Ministry of Munitions, I think that the Ministry of Munitions should then have direct representation on the Standing Council.   With these Departmental representatives, there should be associated five persons of high standing in industry and commerce, one of whom should reprosent industry and commerce upon its financial sido, anrl one person representing organised labour:   these persons to be selected by the Minister of Reconstruction, the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Labour in consultation It would, in my view, be important that the persons selected should net be regarded as speaking for individual industries but should be th*sen on the ground of their wide acquaintance with industry as a whole.5. I am in general agreement with the view indicated inthe Report that at as early a date as possible it sill be advis-able to hand over the work to be done under this Standing Counoi ta Trade Organisations.    But I think it is premature at the moment tc attempt to determine in detail the precise character *f the organisations which will be required.    On&amp; of the first duties of the Standing Council proposed (and this makeB its/immediate
immediate establishment a matter of urgency); should, I think, be to survey the existing mncMnery of control and to censider. to wh    extent it ia p^s Jble   : rrlcy it for the ourposes of allocation in detail a^d to what extent modification is desirable, or use can be made of the Trade Organisations existing or to be set upj   and generally to survoy the problem with a view to reducing by degrees, and finally eliminating,   the Government lelement in the control of allocation.6. At present there exist, I understand, beneath thePermanent Sub-Committee eleven Allocation Sub-Committees.     For materials which do not fall under these Subcommittees there exist a number of semi-independent Boards of Control loosely attached to Government Departments.     In the case of other materials the control seems to be entirely in the hands of special Sections of different Government Departments,    With these systems of control I would not propose at the prssent to inter-fere.    The method, however, of adjusting them to post-war requirements would at once come within the purview ef the Standing Council.7. Another and immediate duty of the Standing Councilwould be to draw up a schedule of p03t-war priority - following of course such general lines of policy as may be laid down by the Cabinet Committee.     Manufacturers are lalready turning tiheir attention to the problem of adapting their businesses to primary post-war requirements.     It .1s essential that, we should be In a position to advise firms as -to what order of work will in the transition period have first claim,    I have not examined In detail the scheme of priority set out in paragraph 6, pages 3 and 4 of the Report of my Council.    But the proposed Standing Council would consider this immediately.8. Applications are already being made in considerablenumbers for (v; usually small ) quantities of materials and/machinery
machinery by firms who wish-ta. begin at onco to prepare themselvet for the transition to postwar work, and who, ,for this purpose, need to make pe^ticular   ?adjustmenc.s in machinery, and to have certain materials for experiments.    At present these application? are being dealt with as far as possible by such Organisations as the Civil Industries Committee; and the Priority Department and the Clearing House Organisation of the Ministry of Munitions, These Organisations,   however, will not long be adequate to deal with the-volume of applications which is likely to be received. Here again I think it is for the Standing Council to consider how;far it is possible to construct out pf existing Organisations a post-war Priority Department which will be capable of deal5ug with this matter.C.

II 22.MINISTRY (F  RECONSTRUCTION. ABVISORY COUNCIL SECTION II, REPORT UPON THE JLat REFERENCE.To the Rt: Honble. Christopher Addison M,D., M.P., . Minister of Reconstruction.Sir,Your reference to this Section of your Council was as followsUpon the assumption that there will be a shortage of certain Raw Materials after the War and that it is desirable that Trade Organisations should be used as far as possible for the administration of any Regulations, which may be necessary, the Council is asked to advise ujjoir the following points :-(1) On what principles the State should proceed in determining the allocation of Materials, Labour, Power and Transport facilities among the several industries.(2) The purposes to which such allocation should be directed during the transitional period.(5) TChat form of Central Machinery would be most appropriate to control the allocation.With regard to the assumptions contained in the first para-?raph of the above Reference, we have not thought it our duty to nvestigate In any detailed manner either the number of raw materials with regard to which there is likely to be a shortage or the probable severity of the shortage of particular materials. It la, however, obvious that If the number is comparatively small the problem of control and allocation is a more restricted one than if the number were large and their character varied,   We have assumed, and we consider that the basis of such assumption is sound and reasonable, that control and allocation will only be necessary and should only be applied in the case of materials of which there is either actual shortage or a shortage of means of transport to convey and distribute stocks to the places Tfhere they are required for manufacture.Suoh general evidence as we have received leads us to believe that in very few instances will the actual shortage of ram materials be very great*    The real trouble is more likely to arise from the lack of shipping and the difficulty of provid-ing tonnage to convey materials from their places of origin to their peaces of use.    We consider that the decisive and determin-ing factor will be ocean-transport.    For this reason we are of opinion that the control and allocation of shipping will have to continue during at least the early part of the Reconstruction Period.     .The guiding principles throughout should be(1) The minimum of control and of interference with private enterprise, that is consistent with the prevention of a general scramble for materials
(2) The cessation of control at the earliest possible moment3, Passing now to the particular questions upon which we.        an* asked to adrise it appears to ua that (1) and (2) are &quot;        not so ranch two separate queetlons as two aspects of thesame problem and can hardly be considered independently of each other.    We shall therefore discuss them altogether.Looking at the problem of allocation in its broadest aspect it seems clear(1) That materials, power and transport must in the first place continue to be provided for all industries - other than purely War industries upon their present scale as a minimum, so as to maintain them at the level at which they are when peace is declared.   Unless this is done there will inevitably be unemployment even before the process of reconstruction la begun:(2) That materials, power and transport should be provided par! passu - but somewhat in advance of - the demobilization of labour whether from the Army or from War industries at home so that the r$-establishment of industries may proceed smoothly and without a mass of unemployment in the earlier stages of reconstruction.In order to determine the order in which industries should be re-established it is necessary that thssy should be tabulated according to the &quot;priority&quot; of their importance, for Reconstruction purposes, with regard to which a variety of circumstances will have to be taken into account.   We are informed that the Board of Trade is undertaking a detailed review of Industries on these lines, which will be submitted to you in due course.We suggest that the following objects should be regarded as guiding the policy of re-establishment.(a) To stimulate and assist the production of food and raw materials in the British Isles to a maxiraun in order to economise over-seas transport by restricting imports.(b) To re-equip - where necessary - the country as a going concern as quickly as possible in order to maintain and Increase its power of production.   In this connection all the means of internal transport are of primary importance.(c) To give priority to the production of goods for export in order to rectify foreign exchanges, restore or maintain our position in markets where we were already well established and to facilitate the establishment of British trade connections with markets frcm which the Germans have been t*$j$pcrm*lly out off owing to the War,(d) To foster such essential industries as previous to the war were mainly or wholly in the hands of foreigners.ocatlon fdq pro-n&amp;iples which
*t (o) To bring about the gradual restoration of ^re-war&apos; conditions of life in this country, ,In this&quot;connection it seems to us desirable that home consumption should In the early period of Re^cnjrtructi^on^ be limited.as far as possible to essentials, in order to provide as large * margin as possible for export,jjQgg Special consideration might  airly be given(a) to trades which give employment to a large numbed of persons(b) to trades in which the number employed Is great in comparison with the tonnage of raw material required, though we recognise that many of such trades are enly ancillary to staple industries and can only be carried on parl passu with them.If these objects are generally r&amp;cognlaad, we recommend that the--aJLloeation of Materials., Labour p Power and Transport ^^hould be directed primarily to industries oonnected with(1) The production of food and raw materialsrgctlon (2) The Manufacture Of machinery and equipment of allfillboa-    - kinds - Including transport - which are immediately% necessary for the re-equipment of ttos oountry(3) The manufacture of finished goods for export(4) the production of goods for home requirements of a pressing character,These indications can only be very general.   Any ideal scheme with regard to the order in whioh industries should be restored must depend for its execution upon facilities for overseas transport and the exigencies of demobilisation to mention only two of the conditioning circumstances.In the allegation of raw materials under our control, the supply of which is short, the requirements of the British Empire and of our Allies uill cleanly have to be taken into aceount under any agreements which may be come to with different pejrts of th  Empire and with out Allies.8*. life have pointed out how largely - it might almost be ,said how entirely - the effective supplies of raw materials will depend upon the shipping position during the period immediately following the cessation of hostilities and we have expressed strongly the opinion that the control and allocation of shipping will have to be maintained during at all events the early part of the period of  Reconstruction,    For this reason it seems to us desirable to set up our views as to the order in which imports should receive priority .  We accordingly make the following suggestions as to their order of priority.1.  SM-entlal food supplies which cannot be or are not produced in this country^2.   Raw materials and manufactured goods which are noV obtainable in this country or are not obtainable in suitable quantities and are required
(a) to enable food to be provided In this country(b) to produce essential raw materials,(o) to afesist in the re-equipment of the oeuntry as * going cbnterhRaw Materials not obtainable in this country, or not obtainable in suitable quantities or qualities, and required.(a) for manufacture with a view to expert(b) for manufacture for home consumptionManufactures which Allied countries must en their side export to keep alive their industries.Raw materials obtainable in this country but at * high or uneconomic cost.Manufactured goods, which are desirable but not essential.Articles of luxury,Machinery for Controlling Priority k Allocation*Recognizing the fact that there sro in existence Bodies, which are exercising the functions of Control and Allocation we thought it advisable to examine their constitution and the nature of their operations.   It seemed to us that such Bodies must have acquired most valuable experience (through both failure and success) of the difficulties attending the control of elaborately organized and highly specialised industries, and that it might be desirable either to Maintain them in existence during the transitional period, ou^bjeet to such changes in thoir constitution as were dictated by the circumstance that their control would be over non-war industries instead of War Industries or alternatively to take whatever was good and useful in them as a guide in connection ttith any new machinery which might be set up.The following is a brief desription of these bodios.They are of twe kindsA  A Central Organisation mainly but not wholly concerned with the War requirements of the Public Departments*iB  Certain Trade CrGanisations, which allocate supplies fcf Rau Materials as between branches of the trade or individual firms.   Such are the Cotton Control Board and the Wool Control Board.In connection with the Central Organisation we have had the advantage of hearing the evidence of Colonel Byrne - Secretary to the War Priority Conaaittee of the Cabinet, who has not only given us full information with regard to the: present, but valuable suggestions for the future.Upon Trade Organisations we have examined Professor Chapman of the Cotton Control Board and Colonel Willey of the Wool Control Board We were also supplied with valuable memoranda by tho Ministry of Reconstruction.4.5,6. 7.
A.  The Central Organisation consists of(1) The War Priority Committee, of the CabinetThis Committee consists of Cabinet Ministers and is presided over by General Smuts,&apos;It it assisted by a Permanent Sub-CgOTnlttee of Heads of Departments^&quot; representatives of the Admiralty, flar Office, Ministry of Munitions, Air Board and Its function is to investigate, and advise,   the Cabinet Committee exercises a general supervision on behalf of the War Cabinet over the distribution of all controlled materials.   It determines all questions of policy and Is a final court of appeal for the various Departments against the decisions of any of the subordinate Agencies described below,For purposes of Administration the industries of the country are divided into&apos; (a) War Industries(b) Non-War Industries(a) War Industries(1) Joint Priority BoardThis Board consists of representatives of the different Departments, whicfe ere us era of supplies.   Its duty is to grade for priority In accordance with principles laid down by the War Priority Committee of the Cabinet the vaious orders of the Government Departments and to  -issue Priority  Certificates upon a unified system, In plaoe of the former practice under which each Department lasuftd Its owii Priority Certificates,  Sir Edgar Jcaies is attached to the Board as head of the Executive Department.   He prepares cases for submission to the Board and carries out Its decisions,(2) Interdepartmental Allocation CommitteesThese consist of a series of Departmental Committees, one for each of the principal commodities.   Their business is to consider the programme of the varie&amp;s departments, compare the desand with the supply of UMitcrlftl-and allocate the actual quantity to be taken by each department month by month,(b) Hon^War Industries(1) A General Services Committee,This Ccsamitteo looks af^ter tho Public Services (ports, railwaysP trama ete*) fcumulates, their re-quirementi and reports them to the Priority Board, which is responsible for obtaining them.
(* ^ An Industrial Sub-Committee.ThiB Committoo consists-of business men and investigates the mirJjnum requirements of non-essential trades and reports them through its Chairman Mr. Wormald to the Priority Board.NOPE There is an appeal from all those Committees to the Priority Committee of the Cabinet.The following Table shows the organization in a graphic form.War Priority Committee General Smuts and MinistersIof the Cabinet Perma&amp;etit Sub-Committee - Heads of Departments.Joint Priority Board [representative of users)Allots detailed Priority grading to the requirements of diffe-pent Govt,, departments.Allocation Committees (Interdepartmental; Allocate supplies&apos; of material etc. in ac-&apos; eordance with require -ments and with the supply available.General Services Committee looks after Public Services, for-mulites thoir needs and notifies them&quot; to the Priority Dept. which is responsible for obtaining supply.Industrial Sub-Committee investigates minimum needs of non-essential trades and notifies them to Priority Dept.6, This Organization may appoar at first sight somewhatelaborate, but this is largely due to the fact that it has had to handle the requirements of both War and Non-War Industries and to deal with the claims of vast competing Public Departments.    Just because the principal users are Public ^apartments for essential YJar purposes the organisation is based up on tho representation of Public: Departmonts.   On the whole it has fulfilled its purposes very successfully and it seoms to us desirable to retain during the period of Reconstruction such elements as are appropriate to the changed conditions which peace will bring about.Cbviously the prinftipal change will be the Immediate shrinkage and gradual subsidence of War Industries and the immediate growth and speedy predominance of $on-War Industries. This will necessarily carry with it a change&apos;in-the basis of I representation.    The new Organization will have to be suitedtf        to the requirements of, and representative of, Civil Industries/.
0,       We recommend that the Central Authority should consist of(1)A Cabinet Committee on the lines of the present Cabinet Priority Committee,Its function would be to decide all questions of polioy, to lay down the principles upon which the block allocations of materials, power and transport were to be made and to determine priority as between different industries,   It would also act ao a Court of final appeal upon all such questions.It should be assisted by(S)A Standing Advisory CouncilConsisting of men of high standing associated with industryand commerce togethor with representatives of the PublicDepartments interested - such as the Treasury, theBoard of Trade, the Ministry of Shipping,Its duty would bo to investigate and to advise theCabinet Committee upon all questions of priority andallocation.When the block allocations had been made to the different Industries their detailed allocation as between branches and members of any particular trade should be confided to(3) Trade Organisationsrepresentative of oach important industry concerned, We do not offer any definite suggestions aa to the composition and constitution of these Trade Organisations, They might Indeed vary in different industries,    Tho Cotton Control Board has been so successful,according to the evidence&apos;put before us, that wo consider that its constitution might with advantage be taken as a model in cases where it is applicable.   It is composed of representatives of Employers and Trade Unions with a few additional members representative of Bodies of special and expert experience.   It has not only worked well, but it has interfered as little as possible with the normal mechanism of trade.Finally we consider it might be convenient to set up,(4)   A Miscellaneous Trades Boardto allocate materials etc, to the smaller miscellaneous trades which are not of sufficient importance to institute Trade Organisations of their own.   In that case the present Executive Priority Department might be taken as a model to follow.
The following W le glvos tho Scheme we recommend in a graphic form,A CABINET COMMITTEE,(a) To decide policy and make general allocations of Labour Materials, Powor and Transport, having regard so far as tho allotment&apos;of raw matorlals and transport arc ooncornod to any inter-allied agreements,(b) To act as a Court of Appeal,esslotodby AiPCPS AimSORY OOtJSOIL,consisting of (industrial and Commercial(Representatives(Departmental Representatives(of say Treasury,Board of Trade, Ministry of Shipping-1-Trado Organisations. * for the allocation of raw matorlals among members of the Trade.
