(This Docit is the1roperty ofovernmentSECRET,Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.I think it my duty to lay before the Cabinet a view of possible develop-nients in India of which it is, I think, right that the,)&apos; should be informed. I have long hesitated to take this course, because I am most anxious to avoid increasing the great anxieties of the Cabinet by any gloomy forebodings. I do not want to be pessimistic. Many of the arguments which I shall use admit of unanswerable debating rejoinders. But nevertheless there are difficulties in India which are not present in any other part of the Empire and of which&apos;the Cabinet should be aware.(1) The politician in India has become increasingly estranged, not from British rule, but from the existing form of Government during the past decades. Among the politicians there is unfortunately a marked diminution in the belief in our sincerity and honesty of purpose. I believe that the Cabinet&apos;s sanction of the announcement of the 20th August was a starting-point of a new era, but a habit of thought iu winch a generation has grown up cannot be removed by one pronouncement. The Indian politician is suspicious of delay, unwilling to admit that it may be inevitable, doubtful of whatever excuses may be offered for the postponement of immediate action, and although in my opinion re-assured by the pronouncement itself, still suspending judgment to see whether it is to be carried out. A belief that we make pronouncements that we dp not carry out is rife in India. Our answer may&apos; be a good one ; you cannot get away from the opinion. Besides this, they are anxious to try and discover that the announcement and the policy which springs from it is really indicative of the genuine feeling of the British towards India, that it was not merely a matter of policy, but a matter of conscience, that we do in. all sincerity want to help them forward to self-government, that we did not merely frame our policy as a matter of expediency because we were frightened by the German attack, but that we look forward and regard it, as our highest purpose to bring India as a partner into the Commonwealth of nations which forms the British Empire. It may be true that this sort of feeling is confined to the Indian politician, but the Indian politician is a growing class, and it is from the Indian politician that we ought to get active help in the leadership of the inarticulate classes.(2) When I listen to the speeches made at the- Imperial War Cabinet and Conference, I cannot help reflecting that they &quot;are speeches, not of English administrators of Canada, Australia or South Africa, but of Canadians, Australians and Dutchmen who form the Government of those countries. How can you expect a similar war effort from India? When the differences are recognised, is not the war effort we are getting remark-able? The Indian Army was in its origin not an army to defend India, but an army of mercenaries to ensure the stability of the alien East India Company. There is not the same pride in the army or co-operation with the army as you can find in any other part of the Empire. It is an army of sepoys or privates, who are asked to leave their villages and go overseas, a thing of which they have had no experience before, for the princely pay of 11s. 11 or 15s. a month! Now the distribution of commissions again affects this, but an attitude towards the army which has grown up for generations cannot be eradicated in a day by a promise of commissions, and if you want to make a national army in India, you have got, it seems to me, to prove to the Indian that it is. for the defence of India, or you have got to pay it on a far more generous scale than it is paid at present. Either it conies to defend its country or it comes because it is given an adequate pay. At the present moment I very much doubt if the pay is adequate. I know it is obvious that any battle fought in any theatre of war is at the present moment a battle for the defence of India, but it is very difficult to get the uneducated Indian .peasant to realise this; it is almost impossible toSS 627-4   60  6/18
explain it to him. Now that you ask him to defend his own country;, there is a tendency on the part of those who can influence him to say : &apos;&apos; Is it to &quot; defend India, or the British rule in India? Is it really a case of British &quot; rule being used for the benefit of India, or for the ascendancy of the white &quot; man over the Indian? Is not this a quarrel between two European races &quot; in which the Indian can well, afford to stand aloof?&quot; There is also a tendency to say : &quot; When we wanted to learn, to defend ,ourselves, you &quot; forbade us to carry arms, and you kept the numbers of our army down &quot; because you did not trust us, and now when you are in a hole, you &quot; suddenly reverse your policy and ask us for the whole of our manhood at &quot; Rs. 1.1 a month!&quot; These considerations may.lead to some surprise at what India is doing and has done. But, notwithstanding this, there is and always will be a feeling of devotion to the King-Emperor and a loyalty to the salt they eat which is a real motive for much service among the people and will, always inspire those who come into or are in the Indian Army.(8) This brings me to the question, of finance. On paper India can well afford to pay more, for the Army, and in capital, sums I think it is true not only in theory but in practice. But in taxation for the pay of the Army the difficulty is enormous. The people are so poor. So many millions of them have only one meal a day. Is it not almost impossible to expect enduring physique from people so underfed? Can you really recruit from people so fed men to inarch 10 miles a day, and can India afford to raise from such people with such previous relations to the Army the taxation necessary 1;o increase the pay to what is required ?(4) I am afraid that when India comes, as I fear it must come very soon, !;o inconvertibility, there will be a loud outcry from India as to the help that has been rendered to the Home Government. Our. currency difficulties are &quot; entirely due to the materials we have supplied to the Home Government. You tell us that you cannot lessen that supply, you. ask us to increase it. It was 60 millions in value last year, it is 75 millions this year. And you can&apos;t pay for it. You give us the money in England, hut you cannot, give us gold for currency purposes. What is the consequence? The Indian has got to use paper ; he has never been accustomed to paper, and lie won&apos;t use it. lie wants metal. You won&apos;t provide him with, metal. His difficulties are entirely due to supplying you ; you ask at one and the same time for increased supplies and promise to pay him money after the war. Is it wonderful that, circumstanced as he is, he doubts the value of your paper?It may he impossible, as has often, been said, to help India out of this difficulty by the despatch of gold, but 1. warn my colleagues that the political effect in India of the inconvertibility from this cause (which is becoming inevitable) is going to be very serious.(5) Then I would also draw the attention of the Cabinet to the position of the Mohammedans. The Mohammedans have not yet learned to find them-selves whole-heartedly Indian. At any moment the smouldering antipathy to the Hindus, which among the educated,! hope, is lessening, may break out. You. may find, vast quantities of Mohammedans egged on by Germans appearing on the frontier. You will want men to keep order in India and men to defend its frontiers.. I circulate herewith a telegram I have just received containing the Amir&apos;s answer to the Viceroy&apos;s letter of the .10th January. I regard it with great alarm. The Amir cannot guarantee Afghanistan against the German unless he gets an impossible amount of armament. Would it be safe to give him armament even if we could spare it, knowing that the Amir stands alone and that any successor is likely to lie pro-German ? Hut at the same time that he expresses his inability to keep the enemy out, he expresses his inability to allow British troops to enter Afghanistan. He cannot light against the Germans ; he won&apos;t allow our help in fighting them. I think it is serious, and what effect trouble in Afghanistan would, have on India and on the Pub jab. I do not know. To the death I believe the Punjabi would, fight against the German. What he would do against the Mohammedan at a time when prayers are still offered for the lihalif, who is the Sultan of Turkey, in. many a mosque in India, 1 do not know.
What do these gloomy considerations amount to? I think they lead to four inevitable courses. The first is to demonstrate our good faith by the fulfilment of the announcement of the 20th August, and I have nothing to complain of in the attitude of the Cabinet to this. Secondly, to increase the pay offered to Indian sepoys from Imperial sources. Thirdly, to assist India in its currency crisis, or at least to demonstrate we can do no more; and fourthly, to ask the Commander-in-Chief in India to raise for the defence of India a second line army, and thus to demonstrate? to the Indian people that they arc being organised to defend India.E. S. M.15th June 1918.
Circulated by the Secretary of State for India, SECRET,From Viceroy, Foreign Department, II///. June 1918.(Secret. Afghanistan. I have received autograph letter from Amir through British Agent at Kabul replying, to my &quot;letter of I0t.li January 1918. Tone is most friendly.   Purport is as follows: &quot; I am fully aware of condition of Russia and clanger of confusion spreading to Afghanistan. The joining of Turkey in the war has had a profound effect on tlie Moslem world. The remedy lies, firstly, in strength-oning Afghanistan, and, secondly, in conciliating the people of India. Afghanistan could never tolerate the entry of British troops; it must be protected by its own people so that if may he a buffer against the enemy of India. If at this critical lime the British Government will give me 400,000 magazine rifles, 400 guns with ammunition and 4 erores of rupees no foreign enemy will ever pass through Afghanistan towards India. Without arms and money what, can Afghanistan do? Secondly, the conciliation of the people of India, without loss of prestige is desirable. 1 have no right: to ask Your Excellency for money or arms, or to recommend people of India to Your Excellency, but as you have asked for a frank expression of my views, I have written what I have gained by 17 years&apos; experience of ruling.&quot;In view of Amir&apos;s long silence there is no hurry about replying. Primci facie the Amir&apos;s request is as it. stands impossible, but the exact terms in which we should reply will require careful consideration, which wo shall give it.
