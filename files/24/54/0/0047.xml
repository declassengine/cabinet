[This Document is the Property^of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.Political Intklligknck Department, Foreign Office.Argentine /001.MEMORANDUMonCONDITIONS IN THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.CONDITIONS in the Argentine Republic are so bound up with President Irigoyen that it is of the greatest importance to try to solve tbe riddle presented by this retiring statesman, who holds so much power in his bands and yet is so little known. In order rightly to gauge his position, we must consider the political history leading up to bis election as tbe first Radical President of the Republic. Modern Argentine can be said to have been made by General Roca, who at tbe bead of tbe Conservative party governed the country so as to keep it free from revolution, and obtained tbe backing of tbe commercial community, the financial interests, and foreign companies. Unfortunately, in order to obtain the necessary continuity in office, tbe party found it necessary to have recourse to the usual South American methods of what is called &quot; making&quot; the elections. Government officials presided over tbe voting, falsified the voting lists, and interfered with the ballots so as to ensure the success of tbe Government candidates. In these circumstances the &quot; Union Civica Radical&quot; was formed, and Irigoyen became its leader. Its sole object was to obtain purity of elections. The new movement soon became one to be reckoned with, and within a perio&apos;d of twenty years, not only did the Radicals twice attempt to attain power by means of abortive revolutionary movements, but three Presidents invited Irigoyen to join their Governments, only to be refused.Eventually, President Saenz Peha introduced and passed a new electoral law which followed tbe ideas of tbe Radicals, was based on the register for military service, and contained provisions for a secret ballot. The programme of the Radicals was completed: As a result of tbe election held on tbe new register and under tbe new system Irigoyen became President a President who, in his own position, realised tbe fulfilment of tbe whole programme of bis party. As it has been said, the &quot; Union Civica Radical &quot; is not a party, but an ideal, and tbe ideal was attained by tbe new electoral law and the triumph of the Radical leader in tbe ensuing elections. As President, however, Irigoyen found himself in a difficult position, for according to tbe Argentine Constitution the President and the two Chambers are not elected simultaneously, and tbe executive was faced by a large opposition majority both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. When therefore, tbe Chamber and Senate both passed resolutions in favour of breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany, tbe President took no action as be felt that the sanction for these resolutions was based on a register quite different from the one on which his own election bad been fought and won. He preferred to wait for the result of the elections for tbe Chamber, which were due in the early part of this year. These elections were duly held, but news of tbe definitive results are not yet. known in this country. From such results as are available, however, it appears probable that tbe Presidential party will have gained fifteen seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The constitution of tbe Chamber will therefore be, roughly : 58 Radicals (Irigoyen&apos;s party); 51 Opposition members; and 8 Dissentient Radicals.Tbe surprises of the elections were tbe Opposition victories in the provinces of Entre Rios and Corrientes, which march with Uruguay, Brazil, and Paraguay. The Dissentient Radicals can be almost certainly counted upon to vote with the Radicals on matters of national importance such as foreign relations. Tbe President is therefore freed from an embarrassing Opposition majority in tbe legislative Chamber and can now proceed with constructive legislation, for although tbe Government is still faced[367-19]

The reply of the Argentine Government to the German Minister early in February of this year &quot;to the effect that &quot;they would adjust their conduct, as always, to the fundamental principles and standards of international law&quot;; the enthusiastic receptions of the United States naval squadron and of H.M.S. &quot; Glasgow &quot; ; the reply to the United States Government on being notified of the declaration of war against Germany, that &quot;in view of the causes which have induced the United States of America to declare war on the Imperial German Government, the Argentine Government recognise the justice of that step in that it is founded on the violation of the principles of neutrality sanctioned by international law, considered as one of the definite conquests achieved by civilisation&quot;; the signature of the wheat convention ; his speech on receiving the new Belgian Minister, M. Melot, in which he said: &quot; The cause of Belgium is at present the cause of the freedom and rights of nations; and the highest feelings of humanity would suffer lasting injury if those principles of justice, whereon humanity depends, were not lasting and sacred. I believe in the power and sovereignty of those immutable principles in ihe history of the world, in spite of all vicissitudes&quot;; the detention of Count Lux burg on the island of Martin Garcia; the discourtesy of leaving unanswered for a long time the note of the German Government asking that Count Dohnhoff should be recognised as charge d&apos;affaires ad interim; the promise of unlimited military support to Uruguay in case of attack by the Germans resident in Southern Brazil, all show an inclination towards pro-Ally sentiment. At the same time not much reliance can be placed &quot;on his actions, as he is continually explaining away or rectifying what -he has done. He has on several occasions given interviews which he has afterwards practically repudiated. He is uncertain of himself. A man not versed in public affairs he distrusts his most trusted supporters and tries to do everything himself. Living a simple bourgeois life he is very inaccessible even to his own Ministers, and in consequence a host of rumours have sprung up about him among other things he has been credited as being under pro-Austrian feminine and clerical influences.The frequent strikes, interfering as they do with railway transport and with the smooth working of the wheat agreement, are puzzling. That they are the work of agitators is undoubted. These agitators lack the means to finance a general railway strike, and so they rely on a policy of continuous agitation by means of a series of intermittent and partial strikes. What their motives are seems doubtful: the pretexts for the strikes have been too trivial to justify the belief that their real object is the betterment of labour conditions; and the assumption that they are the work of politicians in opposition to the present regime is not a likely one, as the result of.the recent elections shows the inefficacy of means so harmful to the country&apos;s prosperity to promote party gains. The probability is that they are engineered by international agitators of the Bolshevik type, and that anti-Ally forces have used them for their own ends. That the President has not taken a strong line to put an end to these disturbances, and has even seemed to favour the strikers against the railway companies, can probably be explained by the fact that the railway companies are identified with the policy of his old political opponents, the Conservatives.The President is also encountering difficulties in the region of finance. Some of the employes in the different Government Departments have not been paid their salaries for months past; and many have been told that they can retain their posts, but that they will have to wait until the financial situation is better before the Government can pay them any remuneration. It is supposed that the President, in order to obtain the money necessary for carrying on the administration, has had. recourse to borrowing from German firms, and has even effected a loan with a German firm which figures on our black list. It appears however that there is no lack of money in the country, and that the banks have more than commerce is able to absorb. In these circumstances it is possible that the Government may float an internal loan, although this kind of investment has hitherto not appealed to the Argentine capitalist.
The attitude of the Government towards the belligerent Powers has been stated by trie President in an interview given to Mr. Roy Howard, of the United Press of North America, which was widely reproduced and subsequently rectified in the semi-official Argentine paper, &quot; La fipoca,&quot; of the 14th April. The amendment by Dr. Irigoyen stated that he told Mr. Howard that it is very evident that the Argentine Government believed that they should assume the responsibilities inherent to the position of the republic, and that it was so demonstrated by the official decisions, whenever such were required, and by the unyielding attitude of the Argentine Government as regards claims in which they were directly concerned. The views of the Government having been in each case respected and all their claims having been completely satisfied, their position was well and clearly defined, and no reason was left for departing from neutrality.If an occasion should arise for breaking her neutrality in favour of the Allies, it is estimated that the President, who remains the idol of the masses, would carry 75 per cent, of the population with him. It is probable, however, that the President intends to continue his policy of benevolent neutrality towards the Allies unless or until he is forced to withdraw from it by some act directed by the Central Powers against the sovereignty of his country. Doubtless President Irigoyen is influenced to some extent in his aversion to break off relations with Germany by fear lest any action of his might be construed by the Argentines as a surrender to the influence of the United States, a point on which they are most touchy.Two recent incidents seem to be a good augury for Allied interests. Dr. Naon, Argentine Ambassador at Washington, who returned to the Argentine in order to persuade President Irigoyen to break with the Central Powers or to resign, has been allowed to return to Washington in order to occupy his old post. Still more recently Sir Maurice de Bunsen&apos;s mission has received a most enthusiastic official and public welcome in Buenos Aires. On the other hand, Count Dohnhoff has just been recognised as German charge d&apos;affaires.
