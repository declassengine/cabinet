SECRET.NJLR, 41.The Man-Power Situation, 1917-1918.Memorandum by the Minister of National Service,1%The Fan Power position during the past year has been shadowedby two grave anxieties and marked by one not inconsiderable&apos; achieve-ment.     The first anxiety resulted from the unrestricted submarinecampaign and all that it implied: the second from the need of replac-ing tho effectives lost in the operations in Flanders and at Cambrai\ The achievement of the year was that, notwithstanding the pressure ofraised in Great Britain was at 1st January 1918 no less than 350,000 men stronger than it had been at 1st January 1917.     The V/ar Office strength returns applicable to these dates show the strength (all arms; of the British Array raised in Great Britain to have been atGreat difficulties had to be met and overcome to achieve this result. The second quarter of the year 1917 opened with a loss by enemy action in one month cf no less than 872,000 gross tons of Allied and Neutral Shipping, a further 591,000 tons were lost in May; 684,000 in June. The danger of the shipping situation was obvious.Immediate steps were taken to meet it.     Men had to be provided for or left in the shipyards.     Vast schemes of increased Home produc-ticn cf commodities normally imported had to be undertaken, and men had to be provided to carry them out.     Internal transportation had to be expanded: the work at the ports had to be speeded up.   Thus more men were absorbed,     By July 1917 the position had been sufficiently surveyed to make it obvious- that the provision cf recruits for the. Army on the scale required would prove to be a task of almost insur-mountable difficulty, requiring the most, careful organisation of the whole national effort.On 1st August 1917 it was decided to transfer the functions cf recruiting from the V.&apos;ar Office to a civil Department of State which,the submarine ca-impaign, and notwithstanding its losses, the Army1st January 15173,311,0001st January 19183,661,000
under the War Cabinet, should be generally responsible for the Man Power policy of Great Britain,     The exact status and. the functions j  the reorganised Ministry of National Service were settled on Ootober 8th 1917.      (Appendix. I),In November 1917 the Director-General of National Service presented to the v,&apos;ar Cabinet a review of the man power situation. This stated in detail the demands of the Armed Forces for recruits in 1918, amounting to no less than 1,250,000 men, and the labour rein-forcement asked for by the principal war industries, and submitted recommendations as to legislative and administrative measures to meet these requirements so far as was possible.     This report formed the subject of prolonged investigation by the War Cabinet in the course of a series of meetings attended by representatives of the i7ar Office, the Ministry of National Service and by the Ministers representing other Departments during such parts of the discussion as affecte*d their interests.     The conclusions arrived at are summar-ised in Appendix II.At this point it is convenient to consider briefly the effect of fhe events which were taking place in the field while these adminis-rative arrangements were being made at home.On 1st May 1917 the question of the continuation of the offens-[ve on the Western Front was discussed.     The dangers and difficul-ies of the position resulting from the submarine menace and its re-&apos; ercussive effect on our Man-Power position were laid fully before lie responsible Heads of the Army.     With full knowledge of the ineral national position and of the impossibility of our raising ^e than a limited number of men for service with the Army the Mill-iry Authorities decided in favour of continuing the western offensive id of undertaking the subsequent operations at Cambrai.     The heavy &apos;Sualties which accrued and the impossibility of training the divi-^ns fully after each infusion of new drafts, the effect of what was common belief the unfruitful pouring out of life, upon the moral the people and upon the willingness of men to serve clogged for fiy months the war effort of the nation.
In spitd of difficulties with Trade Unions (Appendix III) and of steady resistance during the v;Inter months to recruiting on the w part of certain sections of the community much has been done.

The figures of the Army and the Navy prior to that date include the figures of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service respectively. Simultaneously the home production of commodities formerly imported has been expanded.     Timber, ore, food production have each demanded large numbers of men.     The output of new mercantile tonnage has been developed.     The material equipment for the Air Service has been largely increased.     The output of munitions of all sorts, of clothing and equipment for the Armies and the Allies has not been permitted to decline.By administrative action heavy quotas have been and are being jjlevied from among the men engaged in vital industries.     The nicety of the adjustments required to secure such levies without disorganis-ing the industries on which they are imposed is a matter requiring the most careful review of the whole position of an industry.     To snable such reviews to be carried out the Ministry of National Service has constructed and maintains a register of all males of military age
in civil life,     Som^-Qi-^h^^admman-er^TecixLireynents for those industries have been met and the numbers being withdrawn from them for military service are detailed in Appendix IV;Hew legislative powers have also been obtained by the passage of the first and second Military Service Acts of 1918 and extended use is being made of the powers thereby conferred,    (Appendix V).The position disclosed by the complete review of man power which the Director-General of National Service has been able to obtain makes it clear that if the flow of recruits to the Forces is to be maintained without serious dislocation of the civil side of the national war effort, it is necessary that far greater control must be exercised over the choice by men in civil life of the place and the nature of their employment than has been attempted In the past. Steps have been taken to secure this (appendix VI).   Apart from such control over civilians it has been found necessary to employ a certain amount of military labour on civil work.     The Canadian Forestry Corps is an example of this type of organisation.     Comparable British rganisations exist in the Docks &amp; Transport &apos;&quot;orkers&apos; Units with an ggregate strength of 17,COO and in the Agricultural Companies with a aggregate strength of 66,345.In circumstances like these of to-day prophecy is idle and even arefully considered forecasts are not infrequently falsified by the rent, but looking forward It seems not unreasonable to hope t ,a-t ring 1918, as in 1917, Britain will be able, provided there is no erwhelming disaster, to produce sufficient recruits to prevent a. cline in the aggregate personnel of the Forces raised within her ?ders.     Row those recruits after they have been raised, are appor-oned between Arms of the Services is a matter with which the Minis-r of National Service is not concerned.A statistical review of the recruiting effort of Great Britain of the distribution of the men between 18 and 43 remaining in il life in England, Scotland, and Wales is attached.

iv b 2APPENDIX 1.Tha functions and constitution of the Ministry of National Service,The Ministry of National Service was reconstituted in themonth of August 1917 by the amalgamation of the existingDepartment with the Directorate of Recruiting cf the War Office.The functions of the reconstituted Ministry were laid down by the1Var Cabinet in the following&apos; terms:-1. i &quot;Conditioned by*the powers conferred by Parliament:-To review the whole field of British man-power and to b(  in a position at all times to lay before the War Cabinet information as to the meaning, in terms of man-power and consequential results, cf all Departmen-tal proposals put forward to the War Cabinet, and re-ferred to the Ministry for its consideration and for an expression of its opinion.2.   To make arrangements for the transfer from civil work, not declared by the Ear Cabinet to be cf primary im-portancc, or if ordered by the War Cabinet from tho Navy, Army or Air Service to urgent national work, of - such numbers of men a3 may be declared by the War Cabinet to be necessary to reinforce the labour already engaged on that work.3.   Subject to the approval of the War Cabinet to determine in consultation with the Departments concerned, the re-lativc importance of the various forms of civil work, and to prepare from time to time lists of reserved occupations; with such ago and other limitations as may be necessary to secure the maintenance of essential public services, and the preservation of a nucleus cf civil occupations and industries.4.     Within numerical limits imposed, by the War Cabinet to obtain for the Army, Navy and Air Service such men as can be withdrawn from civil life without detriment to the maintenance of essential public services and the due performance of tho -civil work necessary to maintain the forces at sea, in the field, and in the air, and any nucleus cf civil occupations and industries declared by the War Cabinet to be necessary.5.     In connection with Function 4, to determine the physical fitness of men available or possibly becoming available for withdrawal from civil life.No*-o. -   Functions 4 and 5 are limited by the action cf the Tribunals acting in conformity with Regulations and Instructions issued to them under authority derived from the ,r!ar Cabinet in England and Wales, by the Local Government Board; in &apos; Scotland by the Scottish Office.

To make arrangements for the provision, wherenecessary, of labour (male and female) in substitu-tion for that withdrawn from civil life in accor-d anc o w i th func t i on 4.7.      Any other duty which may from time to time be allocated to the Ministry by the War Cabinet.The. reconstituted Ministry consists of 8 departments dealing with Recruiting, Military Registration, Statistics, Medical Services, Labour Supply, Trade Exemptions, Organisation and R&apos;&apos;cruitlnr of VomenU Corps, and Finance, with a Secretariat which exercises co-ordinating functions.   The work of the Ministry has been completely decentralised in the following way t hr ough out the Pr ov i n:o s:-For administrative purposes the Country has been divided into 11 Regions, and subdivided into a number of Areas.   In each Region, and to some extent in each Area, tho organisation of the Ministry is reproduced in miniature.   In effect there is at each Regional Headquarters a minor Ministry of National Service with sub-departments of its own, independent in matters of current administration, but subject as regards policy to the control of thi: Minister.   This is exercised through the Heads of the Central Departments and maintained by frequent visits of inspection.This decentralized organization is proving extremely satisfactory.   It is flexible, economical and as the staffs become trained is becoming highly effective as an administrative machine.

It was fully realised that the loss of man-power caused by the defection of Russia could not bo compensated during 1910, in a numerical i;enso at any mate, by any roinforcemont which it would be in the power of tho United States to furnish within that period, and that, though   tho tables showed a considerable margin of superiority on the. part of the Allies over the enemy, the effects of the Russian collapse could not fail to eliminate this favourable balance before the middle of the year.The measures which in the opinion of the War Cabinet would bo necessary to meet this situation may be briefly stated as followsI.The distribution of Man Power,(a) The fighting personnel requirements of the Royal Navy and ofthe Air Services should have absolute priority over all other services.(b) After tho fighting, personnel requirements of the Royal Navyand Air Services., shipbuilding should have priority over all other demands, and, after shipbuilding, the construc-tion of aeroplanes and tanks,(c) Pood production,  timber felling, and the provision of foodstorage accommodation, since their object is to set free shipping, must be regarded in the same category as ship-buildings(d) Tho, priority accorded to shipbuilding, food production, andtimber foiling is subject to the general supervision of tho Minister of National Service for the prevention of the waste of labour.II.Action in respect of our Allies.(a) Every effort should be made to induce the American Authoritiesto permit the incorporation of American. Battalions in British brigades or of American companies in British battalions.(b) All possible steps should bo taken to expedite the transportof American troops to Prance.(c) The Italian Government should be pressed to supply Labourcompanies for organised service with our army and to form a mobile strategic reserve for use if necessary in Prance.(d) The French and Italian Governments should be pressed to reducethe number of Cavalry Divisions with a view to a saving in transport.
in.***********Action In respoct of the British Armies,(a)   A policy of a general defensive and conservation of strength should he adopted and every effort made to avoid wastage of man-power,(to) The number of battalions In British Divisions in France should bereduced from 12 to 9 in order to provide for the creation of additional divisions forming a mobile army of manoeuvre.(c) The British cavalry on the Western Front should be greatlyreduced in order to free personnel 1 or other services.(d) In otfdcr to reinforce the Army in France the Home Defence forcesshould be reduced as far as practicable and in particular as many Catefory B men as possible should be sent out from the Home Forces to give rest and relief to men who had been fifehl ing continuously on the ,vestern Front. ,(o)   The balance of Amy requirements in men below Category A* shoulc be provided from the Home Defence Forces.Legislation and Administration. A series of recommendations were made requiring legislative and administrative action moat of which have been carried out under the two Military Service Acts passed in February and April, 1918, (See Appendix V) or otherwise by the Government Departments con-cerned.As theresult of the investigations of the War Cabinet and based upon the comparative estimates of Allied and Enemy strength supplied by the General Staff, the Minister of National Service was authorised testate&apos; In introducing the first Military Service Bill of 1918 that It would be necessary to raise for the Armed Forces during the  ear at least 420,000 to 450,000 men, but In mak-ing that estimate it was realised, and the House of Commons was warned, that such a figure must be regarded as a minimum, and it might well be that further and larger leviesw ould be necessary, involving the raising of the military age aid the extension of military service to Ireland.
WgDg XII.The negotiations with Trade Unions and the &apos;*&apos;17c^&quot;lal:ir^Cole&apos; oT&quot;Prov.e^celTMocoupotions ,       &quot;&apos; VIn the Spring of 1917 the somewhat chaotic arrajn^oments&apos; by which men enraged in the munitions industries wore protected-&quot;..fts to some extent codified and reduced to the scheme which is described in Appendix IV.     This, however, necessitated an ex-tremely complicated Scries of arrangements with upwards of 00 Trade Unions for the regulation of the recruitment of their mem-bers and the result vas that the number of men recruited from the war industries during 1917 fell short of anticipations. These arrangements.when they were made were stated to be of a temporary character, and subject to reconsideration as the exig-encles of the military situation required.     Towards the end of 1917 it became obvious that if n rapid flow of recruits was to be secured; these arrangements must be greatly modified,&apos;   and accordingly &amp; series of conferences were held in the month of January with the Trade Unions concerned, at which the military situation was fully explained and the new Government proposals were declared.     It is unnecessary to enter into these proposals in detail.     It is sufficient to say that they considerably sim-plifled the form of procedure;   that they established in prac-tice as well as in principle the fact that protection from mil-itary service could only bo justified by the over-riding noed in the interest of the equipment of the Armed Forces for the re-tention of any particular man in civil employment;   and that they enabled, a larger number of men. to be recruited much more rapidly than had hitherto been possible.     It is due to the Unions to say that the great majority, both of the leaders and the rank and file, accepted the position, and that such opposi-tion as was manifested in the first instance almost entirely disappeared when the German offensive began.The Amalgamated Society of Engineers took exception to these conferences on two grounds.     They contended that no more skilled men should be removed, from industry until all workers who had been introduced to reinforce and dilute the skilled personnel had been removed, and. that, as the former agreement of.May 1917 had been negotiated with their representatives alone, they were entitled to a separate conference now that alterations in this agreement were proposed.     The Government was unable to accede to these claims.     It was pointed out that in the course of the negotiations of 1917 the liar Cabinet representative, Mr. Arthur Henderson, had said that any agreement must necessar-ily be of a temporary character;    secondly that the present need was for young fit men, but that, other things being equal &quot;dilu-tees&quot; &apos; ould be taken first.     moreover, the terms of the agree-ment themselves provided for all the Unions affected being con-suited 18 any variation was proposed, and a separate conference with the A.BMM would in fact be a contravention of the agree-ment which would be deeply resented by the rest of the Labour Movement.     Though, pressed to attend the conferences both by the Government and by their Colleagues in the other Unions, the /MS.IM delegates declined to be present after the first general meeting.     The resulting deadlock threatened for a time to have serious consequences, but the personal intervention of the Prime Minister and the emergency produced by the German offen-sive combined to induce the /,S,E. in effect to withdraw all active opposition to the scheme.Concurrently with the negotiations with the other Trade Unions meetings were held, with representatives of the Miners Federation.       In the earlier stages of the war very large num-bors of miners enlisted in the Army particularly from Northum-berland and Durham.     Later, partly no doubt owing to the ab-sence on military service of many of the most patriotic of the miners, a considerable pacifist element developed in the mines noticeably in parts of Scotland and in South Wales.     It was
impossible to allow this element, to obstruct the withdrawal from-tho nines of as man;/ men as could be spared consistently with, the maintenance of essential supplies.     Firm action by the Government soon found Its response among the patriotic leaders of the Federa-tion.     The claim of the miners that men should be withdrawn pro-portionally from the various coalfields was recognised to be just; and the recognition of this principle did much to win the support of the local Unions, practically all of which have co-operated in the work of recruiting thereby achieving a smoothness and rapidity &quot;hich leave little to be desired.
2mm  r\APPENDIX IV.Essential Industries 2c Special Quotas.The effort which Great Britain has made in recruiting has to a Kge extent exhausted the reservoir of the less essential industries. Vm^ the great bulk of the men, of what may be called the eld militarywho arestill in civil lifemay -e to befound In the essential idustriea which contribute directly to the war effort of the country, e following levies have accordingly been authorised by the Govern-int and are being raised from these industries at the present times .(a) (b) (c) (d)Admiralty and Munitions Work .........Coal Mines..................Railways &amp; Transport .........Agriculture ............&apos;.....,)   Admiralty and MunitionsWork,108,500 75,000 18,000 55,600108,500Shipbuilding, Admiralty largerand Munitions Work together retain in iril life a larger number of young and fit men than any other group essential industries.     In the department of ship construction and pair it has been found necessary to protect all the skilled men em-)yed.     This has been dene in view of the absolute necessity of safe-irding the feed supply of the country and of providing the maximum ofmageboth forthispurnose and for the transport of Americantroopsthearch it was decided to release skilled men from the Navy and try to reinforce the shipyards.   The process &apos;of releasing the men has pn continued as and when possible.   Up to the present date upwards of ,000 men have been returned to shipyard work.   The bulk of the men to iwithdrawn from this group must therefore, be provided from munitions tories; and every endeavour is made by careful administrative arrange-its to secure that the necessary supplies shall not be affected by ir removal. - -The basis of the withdrawal of men from the Munitions Industries is of occupation conditioned by age.    In Hay 1917 when the present em was inaugurated a Schedule of the various occupations was drawn the ages in each occupation above which skilled men should Forces.   These ages were revised in February 19.18, men and the skilled men below the ages in the Schedul&quot; for general service are chosen whom the expertsnowingbe taken for :i the unskilled men who are fit[icials of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions consider canbe spared.     Even after such selection the men called up have a it of appeal to special committees known as the Enlistment.:Complaints nittees in addition to their ordinary tribunal rights.     Ho right of notion is conferred by the Schedule; it is merely a safeguard againstsgree of skill in From this it follows that no man can be be performed by women or by males not fitdepletion of occupations necessitating a certain interests of production, pined upon work which can general service or over the military age.     Similarly a man who is l^antly a bad.time keeper forfeits all right to protection.  -The ihds for skilled men for the artificer corps are met for the most from this type of recruit.Coal.75,000The release of men from the coal mining industry is conditioned by heavy liabilities of the country in respect of production.   For its purposes it has to provide for the coaling of the Fleet and iantile iarine, for the supplies necessary for munition making [other industries, and for the domestic needs of the civil popula-Among the Allies Italy is almost entirely and France to a great Int dependent on the produce of British mines.     The German occupa-of - the industrial districts of France has cut off a great part of [French home supply; and the difficulties of the position have
recently, been aggravated by the threat to the Fas de Calais coal-fields, the loss of which would further seriously diminish the re-maining French output.     In addition to these vital requirements the British Government has in the allied interest undertaken cbliga-tions to supply coal to certain neutrals In return for material &apos;and political advantages.     For example, the Swedish Government in con-sideration of the delivery of a certain quantity of coal has agreed to place shipping at our disposal.Production cannot be maintained at a sufficient level to meet all these claims without severe economies and the strictest ration-ing of coal for both industrial and domestic requirements; and these are being carried to a&apos;point which will involve discomfort and even hardship to the civil population in the coming winter.     But in spite of all difficulties a further quota of 75,000 miners is being with-drawn, all of whom have already been called to the Colours.(c) Railways and Transport.   - 18,000Very large drafts have been made on the personnel of our rail-ways system since the beginning of the viar both by way of general enlistment and in the shape of railway troops for use in making and maintaining the gigantic system of communications necessary to our armies in France.     The strain on the home railways has also been exceedingly severe; and the demands on them for the transport of troops and munitions are not likely to diminish while the war lasts.     Severe, restrictions have been placed on all ordinary traffic both of passengers and goods.The pressure on the docks owing to the submarine campaign and the consequent adoption of the convoy system has been equally great and at the same time irregular.     To meet the difficulties experienced by a depleted staff in dealing with recurring periods of stress specially constituted batt&amp;lions of the Rome Defence Forces, are drawm upon for assistance in any locality when it is found impossible to provide sufficient emergency dock labour from civilian sources.In the circumstances the quota of 18,000 men is the utmost that can now be taken from these sources consistently with the efficiency of the transport services which are vital to the successful conduct of the war.(d) Agriculture. 55,600.In the earlier phases of the war the recruitment of men engaged in agriculture followed a normal course; but the greatly increased production necessitated by the submarine campaign created a demand for. much additional labour, and special measures had to be taken to preserve a large and permanent body of skilled workers on the land and in the auxiliary Industries on which agriculture depends, and also to meet seasonal demands by temporary assistance.These needs are met from various sources,     Ken of low category surplus to immediate army requirements are formed into companies and distributed according to the needs of the County Agricultural C-ommib-tees,     The nucleus of these companies consists of men with previous&apos;&apos; training on the land, the numbers being made up by men whom it is thought would benefit physically by occupation in the open air and by those whom it is hoped will readily acquire a certain degree of skill. The maximum&apos; of elasticity is maintained in this form of permanent reinforcement,     The men are employed in every occupation of the agri-cultural - industry, and not only are the benefits of organised parties obtained but men are employed singly where necessary.
There are now at work on the land over 250,000 women who have for the most part been engaged through the Employment Exchanges, the Tar agricultural Committees and the Women&apos;s Land Army,     The majority of the members of the Women&apos;s Land Army whose strength Is now over 12,000 have been specially trained not only for the form of work which it is in-tended that they should take up but also wherever possible in the locality in whioh they will be employed.     Considerable opposition to I this form of labour was at first shown by farmers in some districts; I but the experiment has been so successful that pressing applications I are now being received for a very large number of recruits.I Prisoners of Far have been extensively used for certain forms ofI agricultural work for which it was found difficult to obtain labour or 1 which were of a more arduous nature than can satisfactorily be performed Ij by women.     The use of prisoners has been found particularly successful jl in the cases of work requiring large organised bodies of men, both I because labour is thereby   : economised and because the administration ji and guarding of workers of this kind is simplified when they can be jl concentrated in a relatively small area.     In all about 12,000 prison-Si ers of war have been actually placed on agricultural work, and a further IjSjOOC have been allocated,   &apos; Those who have had previous experience of [la particular form of employment have if possible been put to similar I work,A. further military reinforcement is obtained by the release of j.: individual soldiers from the Colours in order for the most &quot;part that r they may return to the occupations in which they were employed before \ the War, &quot;   Throughout the year, but particularly for the harvest, .1 soldiers are also sent on agricultural furlough,     Very considerable I assistance has been given to agriculture by the release of men from I the troops of the Dominions.     Tien from these sources have not only jbeen employed for prolonged periods, but times of emergency have been Itided, over by the loan of highly skilled farmer-soldiers used to Iundertaking work on the largest scale,The special seasonal calls of the Industry are met by volunteers of all sorts., and by the holiday labour of school-boys and students. Both.for this seasonal work and for general assistance throughout the year the organisation of part-time workers has been found to produce excellent results, particularly in the neighbourhood of great centreslof population from, which large groups of workers can be convenientlytransported to work on the land.1      The permanent nucleus of skilled labour and its distribution throug jut the country have been carefully considered and regulated with a view jo the release of the maximum number of young and fit men for the Armed forces,   The control of agricultural exemptions by Tribunals did not in Practice work smoothly or uniformly; and there was some danger of ,a sur-llus of agricultural labourers being left in some districts while others pre disproportionately depleted.     Whea, therefore, the quota of 35,500 Pn to be released for military s ervice in May and June had been agreed Jpon with the Beards of Agriculture in England and Scotland, a Decertifi pticn Order under the Military Service Act, 1918 (See Appendix V) was fade withdrawing all exemptiong of men engaged in agriculture and col-fateral industries; and the retention in civil life of indispensable faa is now controlled administratively by Committees appointed by the f&amp;rd of Agriculture in England and in Scotland by the Scottish Office, , jjese Committees operate in each county to which a proportionate share I the total quota is assigned, and, subject to this, share of the men jfeuired being secured, the Committees are empowered to protect such TPi as are shewn to be&apos; indispensable for work on the land which is faessary in the national interest,
(e)   The Civil Service.The increase in the Civil Service which has been found necessary in order to meet the enormous development of its work since the out-brcak of - ar has been met by the increased employment of women.    At tho present time the number of men employed is less by 57,000 than in au; w.st 1014.     In spite of very numerous -voluntary enlistments in the early stages of the war, and consequent depletion of the skilled staff, the Civil Service, by direction of the &apos;*&apos;ar Cabinet, provided i further Quota of 2,000 Grade 1 and 2 men during 1917,     It is not at present proposed to fix a further quota of men to ba released from the Civil Service; but all exemptions held by men of the old military age  :re at present being reviewed by military Service Committees ap-pointod by the Minister of National Service.
/PP.UNDI); V.The Filltpry,Service fcts of 1918.The object of the first Filitrry Service ./ct of 1918 which become law on February 6th was to equalise the incidence of recruiting, and to accelerate procedure.     It withdrew certain privileges which attached to certificates of exemption held by particular classes of men, and placed all men in the same position in respect of tribunal rights.     It further conferred upon the Minister of National Service the power by Pecertificstion Order, to cancel certificates of exemption granted by tribunals on occupational grounds.     This power, ,hich has already been widely used, is of great value in standardising the policy on which occupational exemptions can be granted in the national interest, while reserving to tribunals the power to use their special know-ledge of local conditions in Cases in which exemption is sought on personal grounds.By two decertification orders issued on /pril 9 and June 6 the policy of takinn- men by age blocks according to occupations has been applied to a very wide range of industries, which, while not essentially and directly connected with the conduct of the Far,.are required even under war conditions for the maintenance of the fabric oi the nation.     T:-. selection of the industries and the adjustment of the ap-es of the men affected by the orders has been a highly intricate and complicated task in which the Ministry of National Service has been in long and close consultation with the Government Departments responsible for the interests of the industries affected-; and with representative associations of the industries themselves.     Both in London and in the provinces the close cooperation of the Chambers of Commerce and Trade is of the greatest assistance in the administration of the orders.The Military Service (Mo. 2) Act, 1918 was passed after the opening of the German offensive on Kerch 21 when it became apparent that a rapid acceleration of the reinforcement of the armies in France would be necessary and that the further and more drastic powers foreshadowed in the debates on the previous /ct would immediately be required in order that measures mi pint be taken to deal with the crisis.Its principal provisions are (1) to render all men liable to be called to the colours on attaining the &amp;p.e of 18 instead of 30 days later as heretofore, to raise the military age to 51, and in the case of medical practitioners to 56, with power to raise by Order in Council to 56 in all cases; (2) to apply the provisions of the Military Service /cts to Ireland; (3) by Royal Proclamation to withdraw certificates of exemption held on any specified^ [ grounds, (4) to empower the Local Government Board and the Scottish Office to make necessary variation in the constitution and procedure of tribunals.Special consideration had previously been&apos; given by administrative concession to men discharged from the /rmed Forces by reason of wounds or disability in respect of immunity from further service.     Statutory force was a:iven to this by definite provisions in the /ct, which under certain conditions excepted such men from its operation.Two proclamations dated respectively /pril 20th and
June 4th have been riede under the ,&apos;ot, the effect of which is to ma.ve it impossible for any man in the niftier medical categories between the a*&apos;es of 18 and .23 to obtain a Tribunal exemption except on very narrow personal -rounds-     By an instruction of the &quot;pr Cabinet the same principle has been extended to practically all men fit for ^en^ral service of the same ages in the munitions industries, who ere in possession of any form of administrative protection granted by a. Government Department,Keanwhile the process of brincdn*r the older men to the Colours under the provisions of the /ct is already advanced,   &quot;en up to 51 have been summoned for medical examination and the calling up of the earlier yvars ot the new military age has already begun.Special arrangements have been made for the medical examination of the older men to ensure that the examination may be carried out with the greatest consideration and tact and that they may be.fairly and scientificrlly rradeti having regard to their age and relative fitness for service.It has been decided that, subject to military exigencies, the corps to which the n&quot;er Office will post the older men are as follows i -(a)   Combatant service:   Home Defence Infantry, andGarrison Battalions at Home and /broad.   Royal Field /rtillery, and Royal Garrison /rtillery at Rome,(bj   auxiliary services at Borne end /broad, such as:Loyal /my &quot;etiicsl Corps, :rmy Service Corps, e./r. &quot;otor and Rorse Transport, Remounts, Supplies, &quot;--.c., /rmy Ordnance Corps, ;rmy weterlnary Corps, Inlandoter Transport and Dock, Hallway Troops, Roads and Carries.Such men will also be posted to the &apos;ir Force for duty with the squadrons.
rU 26&apos;5APPENDIX VI.Economy and Mobility of Labour.Tho need of tho Array for men and the measures which have been jjktaken to moot it have,created a shortage of skilled labour at a time (%/hon it is of paramount importance to maintain and even to increase the production of ships, munitions and food and to keep up the other essential national industries.   The situation demands that the skilled labour which remains in the country should be available for diversion to those industries or firms whose naede are for the moment imperative.   It is no longer possible to allow a skilled man to find himself employment where he pleases without any reference to the claims of his country;   still less to allow an employer to keep in his works a man whose skill is not being fully utilised, or who is surplus to the minimum requirements of his business.The Government has therefore decided to take steps(a) To increase the supply of mobile labour by every possible means, and(b) To restrict the freedom of the employer to engage labour as and when ho pleases,*With a view to securing the economic use of labour employed jm essential war work instructions have boon given to the responsible departments to make careful investigation into the labour conditions in munitions and other firms and that, when in the epinicn of the investigating officers, men are surplus to requirements, sir their Mil is being inadequately used, they should be transferred where their services are required.There are already in existence two main schemes for transferr-Ijng workmen in this way.   These aro the War Munition Volunteer scheme lid the War Work Volunteer Scheme.   The former sohemo applies to Itillod men of certain trades and was started in 1916 by the Ministry t Munitions, both in order to create a mobile body of skilled labour ncl also to form a reservoir which could be drawn upon when the need [rose in any locality.   The latter sohemo provides for workmen not ialified to become War Munition Volunteers and was brought into peraticn by the Ministry of national Service in October&apos;, 1917. Under Ither scheme men receive subsistence and travelling allowances where icessary, and as compensation for removal, any loss of wages is, thin certain limits, made up to them.When,after inspection,it is decided that oertain men are Bailable fcr transfer elsewhere, such men, if not already enrolled, &quot;ill be asked to enrol as War Munition Volunteers or War Work lunteera, and so place their services at the disposal of the verninent for transfer, or alternatively, to satisfy the l^oal Ustments Complaints Committee that such enrolment would in their rticular case involve great personal hardship or ,that there are pquato reasons why they should not be transferred to a distance W their homes.   In oases where a man who is cf an age and grade ion is being called up for the Aroy refuses to enrol and fails ta isfy the Enlistments Complaints Committee that he has no real und for the refusal, the protection from recruiting, which he ds merely because he is indispensable to the work on which he is aged, will be withdrawn.It should be oarefully noted that every possible protection Jglvon under this scheme to the individual workman against jtimisation.   fio man will be asked to move until (a) a responsible jioer. of the Department concerned has decided that on technical lunds his skill won^d be better employed elsewhere;   (b) a special
mEnrolment Officer has put&apos; the case clearly before him and appealed to him to enrol;   (c) the Enlistment Complaints Committee has had an opportunity of deciding on dny contention the man nay wish to out forward that he should not bo required to enrol.As regards employers, it is the intention of tho Govern-ment to use the powers they possess under the Defence of the Kealm Regulations to regulate and restrict the employment of any men or classes of men in any firm engaged upon war work.   This will moan that instructions will be issued to firms forbidding- them to engage lubrur without a licence from the Department r.f state by which they are controlled.   In this way firms will he prevented from accumulating labour, and it will be possible to control the diversion of labour to the national purposes for whioh it is from time to time most required.The Government are not/aware of the difficulties they may encounter in carrying out this scheme or of the strain which it must necessarily impose both on employers and workmen.     The exigencies of the situation howwer not only entitle but compel them to make a demand on the patriotism of the Country which, after all, must be regarded as moderate, at a time when so large a proportion of the male population is being called up for service in the Army.
