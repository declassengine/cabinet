Eolitloal Intelligence DepartmentiFOREIGN OFFICE, cnfidentlal,Denmark /003,(Juno 7th, 1918).M EM OR A. If D ITM onTHE SEPARATIST MOVEMENT ITS ICELAND. &apos;It v/ould appear from a perusal of the Scandinavian Press and information received that there is a distinct possibility, in the unlikely event of the Danish Govornment. refusing favourably to consider certain Icelandic demands, that the Icelanders will take matters into their own hands and declare the complete in-aependehoe of the Island.The Icelandic question came into the foreground.in November, 1917, when Jon Magnusson, the Icelandio Prime Minister, applied to the Danish King for sanction of the use of the Icelandic flag out-side Iceland^ territorial waters.    The application was refused at a Cabinet Meeting on the B2nd of November after statements by the King and the Prime Minister that they were willing to enter into general negotiations&apos;and the Icelandic;.Prime Minister -though he made it quite clear that the Icelandio.Parliament did hot intend to let the matter drop, accepted the situation.    From that time until April this year the question has reoeived little or no attentien in the Press:   no further Icelandic claim was jmt forward nor was an answer given to the Danish official expression of willingness to negotiatesOn the 10th of April the Icelandic Parliament met in extra-ordinary session.     &quot;Sovereignty&quot; Committees, ane of each Chamber, were appointed to consider and report as to the steps to be taken i\in order as soon as possible to secure oontrol of our own affairs s, and obtain recognition ef our sovereign rights&quot; and on the 19th of April one speaker in each Chamber voiced the joint demands of all-1- /parties.
parties.     They stated that this time a clear T,Yes&quot; or TfNo&quot; was required of Denmark and that the Alting would not adjourn until a decision had been reached.During the last few weeks the Social-Democratic leader in Ice-land, Olafur IPridriksson, now visiting Copenhagen, has, on various occasions, more particularly when interviewed by a representative of &quot;Dagens Ekko&quot;, the Danish independent Socialist organ, given frank expression to his views on the situation.    He has made it quite clear that he is in Copenhagen to negotiate with the Danish Social-Democratic leaders that the subject of these negotiations is the constitutional relations of Iceland with Denmark, that the flag question is not one for negotiation, and that IcelandTs principal aim is her virtual independence.    He has significantly remarked that unless. Iceland obtains her own flag, the majority on the island are in favour of separation from Denmark and that this is the -Ziwt time in a hundred years that there is real danger of a rupture. &quot;Iceland&apos;3 wish is to take her place as an independent country among the United States of northern Europe&quot;.    As can be imagined, Mr. Fri&amp;riksson1s utterances have created a considerable stir in Den-mark.On the 14th and 15th of May the representatives of the four principal Danish parties - Conservatives, liberals, Radicals and Soclair-Democrats - held meetings.    Resolutions were passed by all these parties in favour of the entaming of negotiations and in the Conservative and Radical resolutions the question as to the form of the negotiations and the place where they should be conducted, was referred to the Rigsdag,The present situation may.be summed up as followsIceland insists:-(1)   . that she shall &quot;be allowed to fly her own flag in foreign v/aters and foreign ports; fat present she may use it only in Iceland and her territorial waters),     Negotiatior,s or no negotiationsv-2- /this
wthis right, she claims, must be accorded her.(2)    That her tether claims, which amount to virtual independence -porsonal Union (i.e., Iooland and Denmark under one king) is the aim in view - shall be a subject for discussion, the negotiations to take place in Reykjavik and not in Copenhagen.Should the Donirsh Government refuse to soh&amp; delegates to Reykja-vik, matters will be at a deadlock.    The determination of all parties that the &quot;Alting&quot; shall not adjourn until a decision has been reached demonstrates the present temper of the Icelandic nation.     It would appear that the Danes are in general benevolently inclined towards Iee-land&apos;s aspirations ana that a Danish delegation is likely in due course to proceed to Reykjavik, which will endeavour to settle matters in a friendly spirit.    This is confirmed by a prominent Dane in the clos-est touch with the Danish Cabinet, who added that the Commission sent ill in addition be instructed to tffor Danish assistance in the de-velopment of the natural resources of the country*     It is evident that the Danish Government are fully cognisant of the dangers of the present situation and arc prepared to go a considerable way towards the satis-faction of Icelandic demands.    It remains to be seen whether ^hey will go far enough to prevent the threatened rapture. vIn view of the present situation.in Iceland, a communication from a very reliable source merits attention.    Its substance is that Wil-helm Jansson, editor of &quot;Corresponded Blatt&quot;, organ of the German Trade Unions, visited Denmark in 1915 and in conferences with the Dan-ish Socialist leaders Stauning and Bergbjerg, stated that DBnmark might recover the territory lost by her in the war of 1861 if she would compensate Germany by giving her Iceland and the Faroe Islands, or at any rate the latter.    The Danish Socialist leaders are reported to have promised to try and persuade the Danes to agree to this, pro-fided England and the United States did not raise difficulties. Jansson assured them that England would be in so exhausted a condition X after the War that she would not be in a position to do much and that the States were not interested.     In 1917 the matter was again dis--3- /cussed
oussea &quot;between Stauning - who, it will be rooolleotea, is a Cabinet Minister - and the German Agent Helphand, alias Tar-was, and accord-ing to our informant the Banish Socialist leaders seemed to be pre-paring the ground for a deal by supporting the Icolandio aspirations to independence.Although we have no confirmation of the truth of this report of German-Danish intrigues, and a Dane of great Influence and authority has shown himself sceptical, the state of affairs in Ice-land lends it some colour.     It would be a great political stroke on the part of the strongly pro-Gorman Danish Socialist leaders if, through their good offices, Denmark regained her lost provinces (or even part .of them) - the seizure of whioh by tho Germans lies at the root of all Danish hostility towards Germany - at the price of an island far-distant from, and of comparative unimportance to, Denmark, whose inhabitants in any case show definite signs of wish-ing to free themselves from the Danish connection.    Che Gorman bait, if it has been offered, is a dainty morsel - more especially for a pro-German Dane.A
