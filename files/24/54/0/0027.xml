June 1918.SECRET.G.T.-4827.Report from, the Ministry of Labour fo? the week ending 12th June, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The internal trouble in the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation is described, and the new National Democratic and Labour Party is discussed.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on military affairs, on Russia, on war aims, on Ireland, on works committees, and sundry other matters, is discussed.Part III: District Reports.The North-Western area is still disturbed, but with this exception the country is, on the whole, quiet.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. The serious strike at Messrs. Grayson&apos;s, Garston, has been settled. No strikes of importance are now in progress,(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work. No serious dispute is in progress.I. General Remarks.The Revolt in the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation.The terms of settlement of the Tredegar strike had an unfortunate result in strengthening the Unofficial Reform Committee in its opposition to the Executive Council of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. The position in South Wales is at&apos; the present moment distinctly anxious. The Unofficial Reform Committee is definitely in antagonism to the Executive Council of the Federation, and has adopted as. its policy a principle that officials of the Federation should be precluded from holding seats on the Executive Council, because, in the opinion of the Committee,&apos; &quot; democracy becomes impossible when officials or leaders dominate.&quot; As is pointed out by the &quot; Times,&quot; in its issue of the 10th June, application of that principle would clear away men like Thomas Richards, M.P., General Secretary; Alfred Onions, Treasurer; Vernon Hartshorn; John Williams, and others, and would leave the con-trol of the Federation largely in the hands of the extremist and unbalanced element. The Unofficial Reform Committee came into prominence as the &quot; ginger group &quot; at the time of the first ballot on the question of a strike against the man-power proposals. On that occasion they were soundly defeated. On the second occasion of a ballot on the comb-out they were successful, but their advantage was neutralised by the general feeling of the country at the time of the German offensive on the 21st March.The opinion of the Executive Council of the Federation on the subject of the Unofficial Reform Committee was very drastically described by Mr. Vernon Hartshorn at a mass meeting of the Maestag miners at the beginning of April. In the course of that speech he said there was no room for such a body in the Federation;[1100-33] Bif- ^9THE LABOUR SITUATION.
that it was only causing disunity when unity was required; that the unofficial body had to be fought to the death, and he was out to fight them.It is reported that the recent ballot for the Executive Council of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation has disclosed a substantial accession of strength to the Unofficial Reform Committee, although none of their candidates was successful in the election.The National Democratic and Labour Party.Anxiety with regard to the policy of the extremist section of Labour is not, however, confined to the Executive Council of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. There has always been a strong body of Labour opinion hostile to the pacifist inter-national party, which at present has so much influence in the Labour Party as a whole. During the past two years, the official element in that party has displayed great ingenuity in preventing definite decisions on the questions of peace and war. This feature has been marked both in the meetings of the Trade Union Congress and in those of the Labour Party. The patriotic section has not, however, been satisfied to be represented by men holding such views as those of Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, or even of Mr. Arthur Henderson, and since the beginning of this month the opposition has taken definite form in the formation of a National Democratic and Labour Party, in accordance with the decision of the majority of the branches of the British Workers&apos; League. The principles and functions of the party are discussed by Mr. Victor Fisher in the &quot;British Citizen and Empire Worker &quot; of the 8th June. Emphasis is laid on the fact that the party is a national party in contra-distinction to the internationalism of the Labour Party; that it is democratic, and means to realise the ideal of government of the people, for the people, and by the people. It does not believe in sectional supremacies based on class, and is opposed to the dominance of any one interest, whatever that interest may be. It is, in fact, a Labour Party of a definitely Imperialistic stamp, and its constitution is so framed as to secure the adherence of all those who labour by hand or by brain, in this provision following the example set by the recent constitution of the Labour Party.There can be little doubt that this new party will attract to its support all those belonging to the patriotic sections of the Labour world, which are at present dis-contented1 with the official programme of the Labour Party, together with a very strong following from the bourgeoisie. The party proposes to contest a considerable number of Parliamentary constituencies, and should be in a very strong position where its candidates oppose those of the official Labour Party in a straight fight.II. Press Comments.Military Affairs.The &quot;New Statesman&quot; confines itself to pointing out that, in spite of the French reserve divisions brought up to defend the crossings of the Aisne, the Germans advanced at a pace which shows that there can have been no prolonged fighting and no heavy losses for the attack. This is ascribed mainly to the new German training and tactics. Only one Labour paper, the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; refers this week to the Western campaign, which serves it as a text on which to preach on the awful futility of violence.Russia.A pamphlet by LitvinofT is reviewed by &quot;Justice&quot; and the &quot;Workers&apos; Dread-nought,&quot; but widely different views are taken of this book. &quot; Justice,&quot; describing it as an apologia, says that Litvinoff&apos;s task is to introduce a washed and brushed up Bolshevism to the British Socialist Party, and is sceptical about the whole exposition in the pamphlet. On the other hand, the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; considers it a clear and thoughtful summary of the events which lead up to the creation of the world&apos;s first workers&apos; socialist republic. Here the belief is expressed that the Soviet Government will persist, and will become the new governmental model for the socialist republics which will shortly follow Russia all over the civilised globe.In the &quot; Call &quot; a warning is given against an active counter-revolutionary intrigue said to be carried on from Stockholm and from London, in which the two great democratic Powers of Western Europe, Great Britain and France, are accused
of playing the part of Austria and Prussia 125 years ago. M. Tereshchenko, who was Foreign Minister in Kerensky&apos;s and Minister of Finance in the first provisional government under Prince Lvoff, is said to take a leading part in this. Russia, is not going to die at the hands of the plotters at home and abroad who are extending the threads of their vast conspiracy. The gods are thirsty, not for the blood of the Bolsheviks, but for that of the counter-revolutionaries and their foreign protectors.War A ims.Discussions still continue regarding the views of German Socialists on the Inter-Allied Memorandum of last February. All papers refer to Scheidemann&apos;s comment that the war aims of the Allied Socialists agree with the annexationist views of their Governments. While accepting this as correctly reported, the &quot;Labour Leader &quot; doubts the rest of Eeuter&apos;s telegram on the subject, and thinks it probable that the Majority Socialists in Germany still hold that their memorandum sent last year to Stockholm is a sufficient reply. The reports from Vienna and Bulgaria are accepted, and these with the German note justify an immediate conference. It is a waste of time to wait for American Labour which is anti-socialistic. The &quot;Herald &quot; thinks Scheidemann&apos;s reply better than could be hoped for in the present military position. His offer can be reciprocated. The Austrian and German strikes can be again evoked, and the world-wide desire for peace can be made to bring forth peace.This treatment of the German reply is not followed by Huysmans, who writes in the same paper on the German and Austrian press. He thinks the Austro-Hungarian reply is most satisfactory, and the only point which seems new in the Eeuter telegram is the appreciation by the Majority Socialists of the character of the Memorandum, as reflecting the Imperialist views of the Inter-Allied Govern-mehts. This, however, he thinks, it will be difficult to prove. Still stronger doubts of the attitude of the German Majority Socialists appear in &quot;Justice,&quot; which says it is necessary -to take into account, not only Scheidemann&apos;s utterances, but the attitude of the Majority and the declarations by &quot; Vorwarts &quot; on war policy, until these are repudiated by the Majority Party itself.Corpus Christi.Both the &quot;Herald &quot; and the &quot; Clarion&quot; approve of the British Governments action in acceding to the request of the Archbishop of Cologne not to bomb that city during the festival of Corpus Christi. The &quot; Herald &quot; also praises the Duke of Connaught for appealing as Chief of the British section of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem to his brothers of the same order of chivalry in Germany, to use their power and influence in putting an end to the submarine campaign against defenceless vessels and hospital ships.Ireland.Comment on the Irish question has almost ceased.The &quot; Herald &quot; thinks the Viceroy&apos;s appeal for voluntary enlistment is a very astute move on the part of Government, for it throws upon the Irish Parliamentary Party the duty of once more taking sides in the war. It understands both Mr. Dillon and Mr. Devlin agree that the war is one for liberty and freedom and should be supported. They raised very little objection to the conscription of British subjects in Britain, though they object to conscription for Ireland. If they believe in the righteousness of the war they cannot refuse to assist in getting volunteers. The great mistake is to refuse to put the Home Eule Act into operation. Mr. Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; publishes Mr. Devlin&apos;s speech at Dungannon on the 28th May, and considers it will have a great influence on the movement for a negotiated peace. Now that he has so definitely and so eloquently associated himself with what he describes as the strong movement in all the belligerent countries in favour of peace, there is not a weak point in the Irish case against conscription, even from the point of view of those who decline to recognise the justice of the Irish demand to settle the question herself.Works Committees.The &quot;Herald&quot; discusses in some detail works committees in,.their various forms.  It asserts that opposition to the Admiralty scheme continues to grow, and
III. District Reports.London and South-E astern.4The situation in this district is very quiet, and few reports have been received, while any slight unrest which has prevailed seems to have been chiefly due to the question of wages.oresses again for recognition of the trade unions. It refers with approval to the report by the Ministry of Labour on works committees which is recommended as well worth studying by trade unionists. The action taken, to establish Whitley Councils is, however, criticised for its arbitrary selection of the industries in which such councils are proposed. The work of the Cotton and Wool Control Boards is held up for careful consideration by the Labour Party as offering suggestions for future action which ought not to be lost sight of. These boards form a precedent that is worth a million Whitley Councils, because the change which they introduce in the industrial system is far more radical than anything contemplated in the Whitley Report. The same paper presses strongly for no further delay in the production of a Bill to restore trade union conditions after the war.Democracy in Labour.In the &quot;Railway Review&quot; appears an answer to recent criticism of the operation of democratic rule in the affairs of the National Union of Railwaymen. The writer points out that the trade union and labour movement involves specialisation in the high administrative branches. Officials of the unions must be whole-time experts, and require training like a recruit in the army. Unfortunately many of the things that matter are left out of the curriculum of the elementary school and are taught only to aristocrats or plutocrats in colleges. A young man coming into the Labour movement has to go to school again, and the only remedy is to explain methodically the machinery of the movement to either individuals or classes.Permanent Officials.&quot;Justice &quot; contains a plea for State officials. Labour has no greater or more urgent interest than to make State officialism strong, efficient, and full of honourable zeal for the common good. Careful criticism of official work ion proper lines is useful, but should be fair. The State must be strong, but it cannot be strong until it is rightly directed. The wrong direction comes not so much from the political Ministers, as from the financial and professional men who control Departments. Until these are cleared out not much good will come of changes of Government. The system of establishing great workshops with State capital and letting them out to private management is bad. Another thing to be condemned is the common vice in political Ministers of pretending that all the work of his Department is done or inspired by himself.Co-partnership.A cautious review of Mr. Neville Priestley&apos;s article on co-partnership in rail-ways (&quot; Nineteenth Century,&quot; May)appears in the &quot;Railway Gazette,&quot; which would like to see an experiment made by one representative line.Food.Pew complaints appear this week. Mr. Hyndman, in &quot;Justice,&quot; considers that the Board of Agriculture has over-estimated its own achievements, especially in regard to the increase in the land sown with wheat. He has received a con-fidential note on the estimate of the cost of the bread subsidy at 40 millions sterling, but refuses to discuss it till he gets a full statement vouched for by responsible people., He asks for full lists of what is generally considered to be a really good standard in food, clothing, housing, &amp;c, so that he may work out an estimate of the things necessary for a decent existence, and thus suggest a minimum wage. In future the standard of life must fix the wages, not wages regulate the standard of life.
At the last meeting of the Woolwich Labour Party a resolution was passed that the Sinn Fein leaders who have been interned should either have an open trial -or be released.The aircraft workers in this area have demanded from the Ministry of Munitions the re-issue of monthly railway vouchers, and threaten trouble if they are not given.South-Western.This district, which is usually quiet, seems to be slightly more disturbed. A short strike occurred among the shipwrights at Cowes. It arose primarily over the arrest of a shipwright who omitted to surrender after being called up. Later some of the workers objected on the ground that they had a prior claim to remain over those who were being recalled from the front to do similar work. The discontent lias subsided, but the men are still aggrieved, and negotiations are pending.The trade unions whose members are employed in the Portsmouth dockyards have agreed to the main outlines of the Admiralty scheme for Works Committees, though a request has been put forward for a conference at which amendments more favourable to the employees might be formulated.West Midlands.Matters in this area have improved, and the few reports which have been received indicate a satisfactory position.The main cause of discontent is the change of time in the last trams to the suburbs of Birmingham, to which reference has been previously made. This subject was discussed at a meeting of the Trades Council on the 1st June. The addition to the early and late train service to the Austin Works at Longbridge has caused great satisfaction.At the Swift Motor Works, Coventry, there has been delay in giving the clerical staff the 12^ per cent, bonus awarded two months ago. The- delay, which is due to a dispute whether foremen were also entitled, is causing discontent.Yorkshire and East Midlands.A number of small grievances are reported in this area, though no strike of importance has occurred. These are due partly to the desire for increased wages, and partly to general discontent with the conditions of work. The Leeds members of the A.S.E. have decided to demand a shorter working week of 45 hours, in lieu of another demand for increased wages, while the local branches of the N.U.R. are supporting the demand of their Executive for increases equivalent to the 12% per cent., to lads and women employed in railway workshops.The imprisonment of R. H. Farrow, a pacifist Labour member of the Derby Town Council, is causing some excitement in this area, and a motion urging his resignation from the Council, which was brought forward at a meeting of that body, had ultimately to be withdrawn owing to the strong opposition from other Labour members. The Eastwood Labour Party has also formulated a resolution of protest against the increasing use of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, and demanding the. release of Mr. Farrow.Objections have also been raised to these Regulations at Nottingham, where permission to hold a meeting in the Bulwell Market Place was refused to the Workers&apos; Suffrage Federation. It is argued that religious meetings have frequently been held here, and that permission has only been refused owing to the fact that the Suffrage Federation is a Socialist body.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald addressed a meeting of the Leeds Labour officials on the 7th upon the future forward programme of the Labour Party.North-West em,Considerable unrest has prevailed throughout this district during the past week, apart from the important strike at Messrs. Grayson&apos;s, which is dealt with in partiy. -The Mersey Quay and Railway Carters&apos; Union have held a m&amp;ss meeting at Liverpool with regard to the recent award, at which about 2,QO0 were present. Much discontent was expressed, and the meeting proved very stormy, though ulti-mately the men&apos;s leaders induced them to accept the decision.[1100-33] C
Applications for increased wages were also the subject of a meeting of the Liverpool Engineering Joint Wages Board on the 9th. The awards granted were described as unsatisfactory, but the men were nevertheless urged to accept them on the ground that a future application would be considered the more favourably; Murphy moved a resolution in favour of ceasing work unless an immediate increase of 10s. a week was granted, but this the chairman refused to accept, and the meeting ultimately broke up in disorder. The shop stewards may now take the matter up, but serious trouble is not anticipated. A good deal of the soreness is due to jealousy of the large increase obtained by the carters and dockers, who are not skilled men.Northern.This district continues to be in a satisfactory state, and little unrest is reported.Trouble still exists among the boilermakers, who held a mass meeting at North Shields on the 3rd. Though the attendance was small, the discussion with regard to the award to repair workers was heated. This matter was, however, adjourned until the 10th, and in the meantime no stoppage was to take place.South Wales.Some unrest prevails in this area though no serious strikes are at present in progress.At the Cardiff ship-repairing docks discontent prevails owing to the employ-ment of men of military age who have left their work elsewhere in order to avoid military service. Many applicants are said to be skilled engineers, but finding work of that description impossible to obtain, they accept the posts of labourers.The proposals of the Government to take over the works of Messrs. Finch and Co., Chepstow, is causing much discontent, as industrial conscription is alleged. A mass meeting was held on the 6th, at which a resolution was carried, strongly urging the withdrawal of all military labour from national shipyards, and demand-ing the payment of trade union rates of wages.Scotland.Considerable improvement is manifest here, and practically all unrest seems for the present to have subsided.The trouble which was recently reported at Ayr seems now to have been for the. most part settled, and an almost abnormal calm prevails in the Clyde area.IV. Disputes. \ (a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The general situation shows some improvement this week, and the more important strikes, which have recently been reported, have now been settled.- The Shipyard Labour Department reports eight new stoppages of work involv-ing 9,244 men, while fifteen previous cases remained from the previous week. In twenty cases out of this total work has now been resumed.The important strike at Messrs. Grayson&apos;s, Garston, has now ceased. It extended on the 16th to Messrs. Grayson&apos;s other works, and ultimately 8,500 men ceased work. On the 8th a meeting took place at the Ministry of Labour, when it was proposed that the delegates should suggest to the men a conference of two representatives of themselves and two of the employers with an independent chairman, work being resumed pending these negotiations.   This proposal was accepted by a mass meeting of the employees on the 10th..No further strikes of importance are reported by this Department.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 21,624 workpeople involved in strikes for tEe week ending the 5th June.A strike involving 1,500 workers took place at Messrs. Crossleys Motor Company, Heaton Chapel, owing to discontent at the present working conditions; as the firm refused to allow a ten minutes&apos; break in the morning for refreshment. Work has now been resumed, but the matter is still under discussion.-A strike of the Cumberland iron-ore miners occurred owing to the calling up of miners of the age of 19, which was resented as- a breach of the pledge that Scottish coal-miners should not be used in the ore mines in the place of those called up.   Proceedings were

threatened under the Defence of the Realm Act, and ultimately, owing to this and to the influence of their secretary, the men returned to work on the 10th.In the Aeroplane Engine Department of Messrs. Crossley&apos;s, Gorton Lane, a strike of 1,000 men is still in progress with regard to piece-work earnings. The claim of the men is, however, regarded as impossible to concede.The War Office Contracts Department reports four new stoppages of work.These include a strike in a Manchester firm with regard to piece rates, another in Staffordshire with regard to the price for Army great coats, and a dispute between hosiery trimmers and dyers in Leicester as to which section was entitled to use an ironing machine. There was some danger of the strike spreading to other firms, but this has so far been avoided, and the unions and the employers have been directed to refer the matter to arbitration.At the Abercorn Hosiery Co., Londonderry, over 500 women workers have been on strike since the 3rd June for a 25 per cent, increase in wages.The Coal Controller has seven new stoppages to report.The dispute at the Maltby Main Colliery with regard to the exemption of an electrician still continues.Three stoppages have occurred in Durham, one of which was in protest against an application for exemption in the case of a man who had been drawn in the ballot.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department reports forty-three new controversial cases and ninety-one old, while settlements have been effected in thirty-seven cases.At Messrs. Swan Hunter and Wigram Richardson, Newcastle, a dispute has arisen owing to the alleged employment of sheet-metal workers instead of plumbers on heating installations.   No settlement has yet been effected and negotiations are proceeding. -A dispute with regard to the 121 Per cent, bonus occurred at Messrs. J. Pollock and Sons in the London area, where the labourers employed on concrete barge building threatened to cease work owing to the non-payment of this award. The firm on the contrary contend that they are paying more than the standard rate- plus the 12  per cent. The question.has been referred to arbitration.- The Ministry of Munitions report that trouble is threatened at the Gorse Mill Aircraft Factory, Hollinwood, because the firm have deducted a 9s. bonus from the subsistence allowances of War Munition Volunteers and Army Reserve Munition Workers. This is claimed as a time-keeping bonus. Pull details have not been received.A strike is threatened at Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth&apos;s, Manchester, because the men refuse to accept the prices offered by the firm.The War Qffi.ce Contracts Department has no fresh controversial cases to report.The 25 per cent, increase in wages in the cotton industry has given considerable satisfaction though, in view of the drastic change in working hours contemplated by the Cotton Control Board, local opinion seems to be that it has not come too soon. The abandonment of the rotation system in the industry may cause considerable discontent and trouble, and the postponement for six weeks is not likely to weaken opposition, unless work can be found before that period elapses for the &quot; played-off &quot; workpeople.The Coal Controller has no fresh controversial cases to report. A general demand for increased wages has been made by the miners, who were to confer with the Controller on the 12th.The Comrn-ittee on Production has heard sixty-one cases during the week, thirty-one in London, nineteen at Glasgow, and eleven at Sheffield.These included seven cases in connection with the 12^ per cent, bonus, an application by the transport workers for increased wages, and various applications for increased wages in the textile trade of Scotland.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 185 differences for the week ending the 8th June, the largest number of which fall in the engineering and metal trade group.A conference of the Union of Dock Labourers and employers in Irish ports was held at Belfast on the 4th, in consequence of which steps are now being taken to refer the question of wages advances to the Committee on Production for arbitration.G.
