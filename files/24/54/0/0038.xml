Assistant Secretary.h Supply to (1),   THE GOAL CONTROLLER requested authority to tempor-fiustries in  arily diminish the amount of Coal supplied to oertein Midlands,   industries in the Midlands, such as, Cotton, Fabrios,China and Potteries, and others of less essentialcharacter.SIR GUY CALTHROP pointed out that while this course must necessarily reduce the output in these industries, yet it would result in his being able to provide about 100,000 tons of coal per week to be sont to Prance,   The Foreign Office and the Shipping Controller did not feel that it was possible to cut,off the supply of ooal to neutral countries owing to the agreements under which we were bound to supply certain quantities in return for tonnage so that Sir Guy Calthrop felt that, if France was to be adequately supplied it was essent ial to reduce the supplies of the industries mentioned above.   This limit to the supply of coal to the Midlands for such industries as were indicated would last for about a month.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in view of the serious situation as regards the reserve stocks in France and Italy, he was afraid that this course would have to be pursued.&apos;   The Conference decided thatThe amount of Coal to be supplied to the trades as specified by the Coal Controller should be, limited in quantity until sufficient reserve supplieshad boon rcooi^cC.

increased Output      (2)   SIR JOSEPH MACLAY called attention to the    -of Coal from the      aorious position as regards the output of Coal, Uinerx. but Sir Guy Calthrop stated that this was largelyowing to the incidence of Recruiting and pointed out that out of the 75,000 Miners authorised to he recruited in accordance with the War Cabinet decision (W.C 417, Minute 14) approximately 65,000 had already joined the Colours.   Sir Guy f Calthrop pointed out that while the situation asregards the output of Coal was extremely serious, firstly, if recruiting was now suspended it would create dissatisfaction in certain districts Where the full quota had been promptly provided, as other districts would not have supplied their full quotas, and secondly, if recruting was resumed after an appeal had been made for an improved output and the appeal had been respondedto the miners r/ould &apos;think&apos; they had been trapped and,in, all the circumstances,he considered it woula beHBetter to Complete the coinp-out   ox75,000 men.   He further stated that an appealhad been sent out to both Owners and Workmensetting forth the imperative necessity forincreased output arid for stopping voluntaryabsenteeism-The Shipping Controller stated that on the previous occasion the Coal Controller had proposed to the War Cabinet that the recruit-meht of miners should, stop at 62,500 men.   The War Cabinet had, however, decided to proceed up to 7 5,000.   Sir J. Maclay pressed the great importance of increasing the coal output and urged the reconsideration of the previous decision. On its being pointed out, however, that the combing-out was already complete in some districts and could not be stopped without great difficulty, Mr. Iloyd George stated that he did not feel able to rescind the previous decision.THE AD JUT AFT- GMERAL stated that he had been studying the time-keeping sheets from different mines, and found that practically the only full day&apos;s work which was done was done on Friday.   Consequently the loss of output from -voluntary absenteeism was enormous,mr. JJjOYD GEORGE reminded the Conference of a Meeting of Miners Agents which had been held on a previous occasion, Which had had good effect, and suggested that it would be desirable if Sir Guy Calthrop could call together the Trades Unions Leaders and the Working Colliery Managers to confer with them as to the best method of increasing the output from the mines. Mr. Lloyd George thought that a continuous campaign was necessary and pointed out that it was most desirable that a healthy spirit of competition as regards the output should be created amongst the miners, and he was quite con-vine ed that if this were done the output would be very largely increased.   At the same time he was quite willing if it was considered desirable, to address a meeting of the delegates from all the Collieries in the Country.The Conference decided that -The Coal Controller Bhould hold a Conference with the Miners Trades Unions Leaders and Working Colliery Managers to decide as to the best steps to be taken to increase&apos;&apos;the output from the Mines,
\   &apos; 1 .,,,.118(3) SIR GUY CALTHROP stonily urged that the Ad Jut oat-General should give instructions for the return to the mines of from 500 to 1,000 pra-war Uiners from Franco who are unfit for combatant duties. Sir *uy Calthrop was of the opinion that if these men could be returned and spread over the Country the political effect would be most valuable.SIR IIEYIIi MAORSADY pointed out that while he was . very anxious to assist the output of coal 1b every wajr, to take men from prance who are unfit for combat-ant duty, meant taking men vino were engaged on labour, and tfcat Labour in France was causing considerable anxiety at the present time, as many Indians and South Africans were leaving.   It was most important also that if these, men were brought bacfc they should be men who were Kinore before the war.SIR GUY CALTHRO? stated that lie would send the Adjutants-General the names of 500 men unfit for combat-ant duty who wore now serving in France,Tho Conference decided that:-On receipt of the names of 500 pre-war Miners unfit for combatant duty in France, the Adjutant-General should communicate with Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Kalg in order to arrange for the return of these den for duty in the mines in England.3IB GUY CALTHROP requested authority to make use wherever possible of the transport Workers Battalions for employment with the Railway Companies in order to pick up stocks of coal from railway centres, to enable a specia^lot of 150,000 tons to be shipped to Italy as a strategic reserve and to assist with the additional quanti ty re quired for Franc e*3IR JOSEPH IvIACLAY explained that these Battalions were generally very fully employed.   It might be that they were more or less unoocupied for a few days at a time, but this waa very unusual.   He sus6asts&amp; that there wore some 6,000 men at Chepatow who belonged to the Inland Water Transport Department who might be utilised,SIR mm MAGREADY pointed out that these men now were in the Navy having been transferred from the Inland Vi&apos;-i*er Transport.SIR GUY CALTHROP stated that it was very important to be ab3,e to use these Transport Battalions if possible, end that if they oould be utilised it would be possible to send more coal to France as well as to Italy immediately.The Conference decided that:-flhere possible the Transport Workers Battalions should be put at the disposal of the Railway Companies in order to assist in lifting coal from stocks.. 2, TThitshall hardens, S.&apos;,&apos;/.l. 13th June,, 1918,.ell ofers from, jive Sorvice..toyment ofIsportlarslalions.
