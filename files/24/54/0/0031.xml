tgHIB BOCWfWOT t&amp; m PROPERTY of HIS BftjtTAWII yAJ^STY/S G0V1TOOTT,)SECRET.^ WAR 0ABIKF.T.CU T. 4831.HORSY,   RACIjtTO. Memorandum, by, Lord Cureon. (Reference gar Cabinet 412, 7rinute, l) .The War Cabinet will remember that on Kay l?th, I was authorised, together with &apos;rr. Prothero and Sir Albert Stanley to meet the representatives of the Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee, and to communicate to them the decisions on Horso Racing approved by tho &apos;7ar Cabinet subject to any representations made to mo on behalf of thoso bodies, which I might consider ,vorthy of attention.     The Cabinet&apos;s decisions had been based on the recommendations of tho President of the Board of Trade (G.T.4^18).At this meeting no case was made out for any modifioa-tion of tho above decisions, and accordingly, the President of the Board of Trade confirmed by letters to the Jockey Club, on the 22nd J&apos;ay, and to the National Hunt Committee, on tho 28th Hay, the conclusions arrived at.A certain amount of criticism, mainly from the pro-racing public, has since appeared in the Public Press.    This was only to be expected.     It was followed by. a letter dated June 6th, addressed to the President of tho $card of Trade by Mr. Horatio Bottomlcy, as President of the Racing Emergency Committee, suggesting that, in order to avoid any agitation, an undertaking should bo given that at tho end of the Flat Racing Season., there would be no objection to a limited programme of National Hunt lootings at a venue or venues to be agreed upon.As the principal reason given by mo for the limitation of Racing had been the groat strain on the facilities available on the Railways for dealing with essential traffic, and as Racing under the rules of tho: National Hunt Committee was stopped, mainly on the advice of the Array Council, I consulted the Chairman of the Railway Executive Committee and the quarter master G-encral on this proposal.     The Chairman of the Railway Executive Committee answered as follows :-&quot;If. the Cabinet press for something to be done, next    % winter, wo could no doubt arrange for a limited number of meetings to be held at Windsor, Sandown and Manchester. Tho Railway Companies would, ofcourse, prefer that no meetings should take place during the winter,&apos; and it is only with a vie1&quot; of enabling a compromise&apos; to be effected that &quot;jo aro prepared to make the limited offer contained in this letter.&quot;The quartermaster General also replied as follows&quot;It really is entirely a question of policy, and Steeple-chasing has practically no effect whatever on the horse-breeding question, with which alone      are- concerned at the 7ar Office.     It may improve the Stamina of mares, but that is all that can be said in i%b favour, and if Steeple-chasing was 3tonped for the next two years, it would not effect the thoroughbred stock in Great Britain.&quot;
Another quostion has also arisen in connection \j this matter, namely, the holding of &quot;unauthorised&quot; or &quot;flapping&quot; Meetings which it appears are held, very ofto in connection TLth sports or other entertainments, large in munition areas, and ^hieh are flat amcing meetings in a thin disguise. It has been represented to me very st that it is unfair on the Jockey Club, &quot;&apos;bioh no oontr over these Meetings, to limit legitimate Racing, and not prohibit the holding of such Meetings.I have been in communication with the Board of I the Home Offico, &apos;and the Ministry of Munitions^ but none these Departments is prepared to assume the reBpon&amp;ibili for issuing instructions for prohibiting these Meetings,In view, therefore,, of the amount of public feel which is always sho^-m in connection with these matters, of the certainty, if any modification of the published decisions of the War Cabinet is now made, that question arise in the Houde of Commons, I would asK for the decis of the War Cabinet on the two following points.(a). Whether there shall be any modification of decision already announced in respect of J under National Hunt Rules.(b)    Whether, in view of thcg-* decisions as to Racing, Unauthorised&apos; or &apos;flapping&apos; Meet! shall he prohibited;   and if so whether tli War Cahinet will issue instructions to the Departments concerned.(Intd.)   0. of K.2 Whitehall Gardens,, S,W, 1, 13th June, 1918.
