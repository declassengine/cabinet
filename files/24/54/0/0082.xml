As the time at our disposal to-night for the discussion of the action to be taken in reference to Ireland must necessarily be very short, I venture to make my pro-posals on paper in the hope that my colleagues will be good enough to read them before we meet and so avoid the neces-sity of my making any statement.Speaking for myself alone., possessed as I am now of the fullest and most reliable information with regard to the condition of Ireland - information which is derived from many sources both official and unofficial - I am quite convinced that any attempt to deal with Home Rule for Ireland by itself would meet with violent opposition from the Unionists of the North and South, and with derision by the Nationalists, while, as regards the rest of Great Britain, I believe that the feeling against Ireland has reached what is almost a danger point owing -(a) to the refusal of Irishmen to bear their share in -the war:(b) to replacement by young Irishmen of Englishmen, Scotsmen, and Welshmen who have gone to tne Colours;   and the natural consequence of this is that there is a change in public opinion in regard to Home Rule which would, I am sure, be reflected in the House of Commons.    If I amright, the minister introducing the Bill would be in the extremely unpleasant position of having practically no support in the House.    In these circumstances, the position of the Government would I venture to say be absurd.There is, however, ,another aspect of the case. The Irish Government are rightly taking drastic measures to deal with lawlessness and disorder, and there is a very strongfeeling
fooling on both eid.ee of the Irish Channel that tho condition of the country being what it is, it would bo wholly wrong to attempt to frame a new Constitution.I doubt whether tho real gravity of tho Sinn Fein movement is fully appreciated in this country. In Ireland it has gone much deeper than even I had believed until up to quite recently.   Papers found upon Mr. de Valera show that his preparations for the formation of an Irish Army wore complete and thorough in every detail.   In Australia and in the United States of America Sinn Fein is recognised as a very dangerous organisation, and I think, there is clear evidence of complete union between the forces of Sinn Fein in different parts of tho world.    Until this organisation has been completely exter-rninated public opinion in Ireland and, I beliovo, hero, would I am convinced resent any attempt to make concessions to that body of Irish opinion which has hitherto demanded Home Rule. To satisfy the majority of Irish Nationalists including many, who are not Sinn Feinors is impossible.The demand now is for Dominion Home Rule complete in every particular, and anything else will be received with contempt. The question therefore is how are we to deal with the present situation and the pledges of the Government? I am.more than ever convinced that there is only one way in which we can maintain a creditablo position.We must admit that we wore not aware of the true condition of Ireland when we made our promise to Parliament: that now Tie find it impossible to carry Home Rule or enforce Conscription for the present: that we intend to pursue our policy of restoring order and obedience to the law conjoinedwith
with a determined and well organised effort to secure voluntary recruits, end that as regards self-Government it is obviously useless to try and deal with Ireland alone:   hut we believe devolution to be absolutely necessary and are therefore preparing a measure for Ireland which will be on strict Federal lines, and that we have appointed a Committee to consider what form the Federal scheme should take for the rest of the United Kingdom,The information which reaches me from the House of Commons and the country convinces me at all events that all that is wanted in order to secure a cordial reception for this policy is a strong and definite lead, by the Government.    As I have stated to the - Cabinet in a previous Liemorandum dated the 9th May, I feel more strongly than I can express that we must have a Federal system for the United Kingdom or find ourselves confronted with insuperable and moat dangerous obstacles to Imperial and domestic, progress on the con-elusion of the war.WJLL. 19. 6. 18.COLONIAL OFFICE.
