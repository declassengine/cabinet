Involving a Stoppage of Work. The only strike of serious importance is that at the Gorse aild Lilac Mills, near Oldham.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work. The question of dilution is leading to considerable trouble.   With this exception there are no serious controversial cases.I.-General Remarks.The Chadderton and Shaw Strike.About a fortnight ago there was trouble at the Lilac Mill, Shaw, twenty-seven electricians, there employed on construction, struck in order to obtain the concession of free railway passes once in six weeks. Among the electricians at this mill is Stavenhagen, chairman of the E.T.U.On Monday, 10th June, 2,700 men, forming the whole complement of workmen at the Gorse Mill, Chadderton, with the exception of some 500 Australians and a few joiners, came out on strike on the ground that an outworking bonus of 9s. per week; which had been paid to the whole of the staff since February last, was stopped by authoritative order, and the next day the Lilac Mill came out in sympathy. The total number of men on strike at the time of the last available report was 3,500.The origin of the 9s. bonus,, which appears to have been paid by the contractors without authority, and in addition to the sanctioned 17s. 6d. subsistence allowance for non-resident workers, is shrouded in obscurity. When work commenced at the Gorse Mill the whole of the men, with the exception of about 5 per cent., were outworkers, and the 9s. bonus paid to those 95 per cent, was unquestionably an outworking bonus, but it appears that the contractors also paid the 9s. bonus to the remaining 5 per cent, who were residents of Chadderton. The percentage of local residents employed at the mill has increased, until it now amounts to about 50 percent, of the whole staff.When work commenced at the Lilac Mill, the 9s. bonus appears to have been paid in accordance with the precedent of the Gorse Mill at Chadderton.[1100-34] V t
The men claim that the bonus is not in fact an outworking bonus at all, but is a timekeeping bonus, to which they are entitled on condition of good timekeeping during the week, and that bad timekeeping is penalised by a reduction of Is. 6d. on each occasion on which a man arrives late at his work. However this may be, it appears unquestionable that the bonus was unauthorised, and that it has been regarded by the men as a portion of their wages.Shortly after the commencement of the strike the Manchester Shop Stewards were approached, and on the 13th June they addressed a letter to the firm demanding, first, that the allowance of 9s. should continue ; second, that the hours originally worked at the Lilac Mill should be resumed; third, that a guarantee should be given that the bonus will not be removed in future; and, fourth, that the electrical engineers employed at the Lilac Mill should be paid full wages for the week ending the 8th June, and that they also should receive the subsistence allowance. The second and fourth of these demands refer to grievances local to the Lilac Mill. Stavenhagen and Wilkinson, the latter being Secretary of the Workers&apos; Council, have been appointed members of the Shop Stewards Committee of Manchester, and it is therefore obvious that the sympathies of that Committee are not likely to be alienated from the strikers. Action has, how-ever, been taken to enlist sympathy on a more widely extended scale, and Stavenhagen and Wilkinson attended a meeting of the Electrical Trades Union at Liverpool. That Union promised to call a special meeting to consider the strike at the Gorse and Lilac Mills. Stavenhagen has also commenced a&quot;n agitation among the electricians in London, and hopes to precipitate a strike throughout the country, and to stop the arsenals if necessary. The position is therefore unquestionably anxious, and there seems every possibility that, if the strike on its present basis is allowed to continue, sympathetic action in other quarters may ensue.The question of the 9s. bonus is at present forming the subject of enquiry, and until that enquiry is complete it is impossible to fix the responsibility for what seems to be an unauthorised addition to the men&apos;s wages. There can, however, be no question but that the men, apparently with some reason, regard the bonus definitely as a portion of their wages, and consider that the orders under which it has been stopped are tantamount to a reduction of the wage to which they are entitled. They have, therefore, a grievance for which, apparently, there is reason. At the same time it would be exceedingly unfortunate if the experience of the Tredegar strike were to be repeated and illegal action by the strikers were to result in surrender to their demands. Whether it is finally decided that the 9s. bonus should be recognised as a timekeeping bonus or not, it is certainly essential that the demand that the men should return to work before their case is considered should be insisted upon. This is a condition which the Government is not only entitled but, in accordance with its declared policy, is bound to make, and as long as the demand is made on a clear understanding that the case of the 9s. bonus will not be prejudged, it is possible that this will afford a solution of the difficulty.The strike has disclosed a state of affairs which it is difficult to understand. It is not clear, for instance, how the contractors came to pay the bonus in the first instance, or how they could continue to pay it&apos;for four months without detection of the unauthorised payment. These are matters into which enquiry will be necessary and will doubtless be made.   But meanwhile the first essential is the resumption of work.II. Press CojI iexts.Military Affairs.The &quot; New Statesman&quot; takes a grave view of the position. There is not much doubt that the effect of this year&apos;s fighting has been to weaken the Anglo-French armies far more than the German one. Any definite tactical inferiority is a terribly serious thing while it lasts,, not merely for its direct consequences, but for its influence on moral. The only reference in Labour papers to the military position is in the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; which says that the copious reference to atrocities, which have appeared in the press during the last few weeks, are due to the unfavourable situation at the Front. It also suggests that war news is intentionally cut down for the same reason.France and Peace.A striking article by Mr. Robert Dell, late Paris correspondent of the &quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot; on the present political conditions in France appears in this week&apos;s &quot; Herald.&quot;
He describes the mass of the French people as no longer prepared to go on fighting for the moon. The Parliament is unpopular, and minority socialist deputies are charged with not endeavouring to end the war on reasonable and honourable terms. The press is tied or muzzled and public meetings are prohibited. Describing strikes all over France in the middle of May, he says that the workers came out, not because of the decision to send workmen to the front, but through disgust at the action of the Allied Governments in rejecting peace proposals, and at the recent prosecutions. At a recent meeting of the Socialist group of the Left on the 7th June, a claim was made that the working classes should be consulted, and the Trade Unionists who had been arrested should be released. There are signs that these demands will be listened to by M. Clemenceau; if he does not, he will make room for somebody who will. The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; also notes a sudden outburst of a desire for peace in the French newspapers, and compares it with discussions in German papers of all shades of opinion. The &quot; Clarion,&quot; on the other hand, will have nothing to do with these suggestions, and says that British Bolshevism has declined very considerably during the last six months.Germany.M. Huysmans writing in the &quot; Herald &quot; contests the view that the Inter-Allied Socialist Memorandum accepts the imperialist aims of the Entente Governments. If the French Socialist ideas on Alsace-Lorraine are Imperialist, then the German Socialist party has been Imperialist for many years, as Bebel and Liebknecht were imprisoned for similar views. An article in &quot; Justice &quot; insists that the idea of nationality has come to be accepted by International Socialists. If German Socialists wish to be admitted again in the Internationale, they will have to accept the principles of national self-determination in practice in the spirit of the Inter-Allied Socialist Memorandum, or they will stand outside the pale of humanity.The Lichnowsky Memorandum.In &quot; Justice &quot; Mr. Morel&apos;s views on the Lichnowsky memorandum are strongly criticised. The writer makes a distinction between pacifists like himself who consider that war is a crime, but that Germany must be beaten for causing it, and those who profess to abhor war, but will not help in chastising the criminal.Land Nationalisation.Mr. Brailsford in the &quot;Herald&quot; takes advantage of the offer of land in Lord Frenches proclamation to claim a large provision for discharged soldiers in Great Britain. In Russia, Socialists are unanimous in holding that no man should have more laud than he and his family can till with their own hands. The workers in this country know that they have the right to demand, but they must agitate, combine, and vote, if they hope to receive their share of. their Motherland.Labour Conference.The agenda for the conference of the Labour Party is exciting some conflict of opinion, and the proposal by the executive that the party truce should be annulled is discussed by the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and &quot;Justice.&quot; While the former argues that if the Party resumed its independence, it is difficult to see how Labour members can remain in the Government, &quot; Justice&quot; thinks the truce of little importance as no Government recently has had any serious purpose. It blames the executive for proposing to force on the conference the question of an international meeting, and for inviting foreign Socialists of incompatible war views to take part in helping to achieve the impossible. The presence of Troelstra is a distinct incitement to disorder. To the &quot; New Statesman&quot; it will be a source of regret if he is not allowed to attend. Mr. Lansbury in the &quot;Herald&quot; makes a strong appeal for money, and suggests a shilling fund.Trade Unions.In the &quot;Postal and Telegraph Record&quot; several notes advocate closer unison among the various pest office societies and affiliation to the Labour Party. The aim is to assume control of the whole organisation of the services.[1100-34] B 2
The &quot; Electrician &quot; reports that power supply engineers propose to form a trade union in order to get a legal status and to become qualified for organisation in a Whitley Council.Tredegar Strike.An article in the &quot; Engineer &quot; replies with some heat to Mr. Hartshorn&apos;s threat that the coal miners will force nationalisation. The want of discipline among rank and file is due to the wild talk of the leaders. Production per head has decreased in spite of the improved machinery. Higher wages can be ensured only through increased output.Food.All papers continue to praise the work of Lord Rhondda and Mr. Clynes, and the general tone is to suggest that Government activities shouid be extended in the fields of production and distribution, and should continue after the war. The &quot; New Statesman&quot; describes the difficulties and praises the manner in Avhich they were overcome.The &quot;Herald&quot; says that profiteering has heen only arrested, not killed. Local authorities should distribute, and national kitchens should be established in every large street or group of streets. The &quot; Clarion &quot; deals generally with the meat supply. Mr. Hyndman in &quot; Justice &quot; thinks that after disposing of the milk question the Ministry should take up the whole field, and not be too chary of interfering with existing systems.   His solution to the problem is the extension of co-operation.III. District Eeports.London and South-E-astern.General quietness still prevails in this area, and aircraft workers alone seem to have grievances. The premium bonus system is not approved by the London District Aircraft Committee, and a ballot has been taken at many works. Men in the Nieuport works, Cricklewood, threaten to strike if it is introduced. A short stoppage occurred at Messrs. Napiers, Acton Vale, owing to a man having been placed in charge of the women workers.South- Western.No trouble is reported. Members of the A.S.E. in the dockyard at Devonport are endeavouring to secure exemption from military service.West Midlands.Eeports indicate a generally satisfactory position. There is, however, some resentment at the number of Chinamen engaged in factories at Birmingham.Yorkshire and East Midlands.In all parts of this area dissatisfaction is increasing, though no serious trouble has yet arisen.Farmers at Wakefield comolain of the minimum wa^e of 35s.. and claim that washes and prices should be co-ordinated.At Nottingham the corporation employees in the electrical department are claiming the 12^ per cent, bonus in addition to the national award of ll. a week. The increase from Is. 2f d to 1*. i\d, per hour, as a result of arbitration, has settled affairs in the building trade.Great political and social activity is being displayed by women in this area.The Shop Stewards of the A.S.E. at Sheffield are organising opposition to a rise in the.age limit for skilled men.In Leeds the engineers are demanding shorter hours and an increase of wages.Workers throughout the whole textile industry in Bradford, Huddersfield, aud Halifax are dissatisfied with the interpretation of the recent award of 5 per cent, and the increase in hours from 50 to 55 due to the withdrawal of men. Demands are made for the extension of the &quot; one-break&quot; svstem.
IY. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.With the exception of two strikes, referred to in Part I of this Eeport, the general situation is good.The Shipyard Labour Department reports two new stoppages, involving 952 men and seventeen remaining from the previous week. Work has been resumed in eighteen cases.The only strike involving a considerable number of men was at G-uest, Keen, and Nettlefold&apos;s (South Wales), where 900 men were idle, owing to the posting of a foreman to work dealt with by a union to which he did not belong.A strike affecting some 250 electricians has taken place at Messrs. Johnson and Phillips, Charlton, commencing with the night-shift, on the 15th instant. The dismissal of a superintendent was demanded. Work was resumed on the morning of the 18th June.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 15,380 workpeople involved in strikes in the week ending the 12th June.Apart from the strike at the Lilac and Gorse Mills, described in Part I, there is no new case of importance. Dilution by women or discharged soldiers has been the chief cause of trouble.About 2,500 workpeople were idle for two days at the Sopwith Aviation Company (Kingston) because a man was dismissed for doing private work in the firm&apos;s time.The War Office Contracts Department reports no new stoppages.North-Western.Unrest is still prevalent. The chief event has been the strikes in the Lilac and Gorse Mills, Chadderton, which are dealt with fully in Part I of this Report.The Shop Stewards met at Manchester on the 14th June to protest against the issue of summonses against men concerned in a recent strike at Crossley&apos;s, which have since been withdrawn.   They also considered the Lilac and Gorse Mills&apos; strike.The Liverpool District Aircraft Committee have given notice of their intention to strike after twenty-one days if rates are not increased from Is. 3d. to Is. iSd. per hour.The Building Trade Committee at Liverpool decided on the I 6th June to reject the proposal that the rate of Is. (Jd. per hour should include the 12^ per cent, bonus.In Barrow the boilermakers have decided to strike if any more riveting competitions take place.Northern.Reports are favourable. At a meeting of the boilermakers on the 10th June the agreement for increases to riveters, caulkers, and platers was approved entirely.South Wales.Affairs in this area have settled down and the grievances are of a minor character.At Cardiff the dilution officers are accused by both employers and men of unneces-sarily moving workers.Complaints are made at Bargoed of the appointment to the Pensions Committee of a man named Morgan Jones who served several terms of imprisonment as a conscientious objector.Scotland.Pacifist agitation is still being fomented, but results are not important.The Glasgow Corporation forbade a demonstration projected for the 15th June by the Partick Labour Parliamentary Committee. About 200 persons who collected were harangued by Maxton, Gallacber, &amp;c. A noisy meeting, arranged by the Peace by ISTegotiation Joint Committee, took place on the same day. At a third meeting (C.W.C.) a delegate from Edinburgh reported that repair workers at Rosyth had struck, and urged that the Clyde area should join.A general strike of sett-makers in most quarries in Scotland began on the 10th June with the object of obtaining increased rates.
The Goal Controller reports seven new stoppages.At Maltby Colliery the men resumed work on the 17th June, unconditionally, after having been idle since the 28th May.   Attempts to bring out other collieries failed. All the new cases are unimportant, and in all but two work has been resumed.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.,The Shipyard Labour Department reports thirty-seven new and ninety-three old controversial cases, of which thirty-two have been settled.The dispute about employment of sheet-metal workers and plumbers at Messrs. Swan, Hunter j and Wigham Hiohlardsoh, Newcastle, still continues. Most cases refer to demarcation.The Ministry of Munitions reports that dilution gives much trouble.The Sheet-Metal Workers&apos; Society; at.Birmingham, now claim that even the simplest operations are men&apos;s work, for which women must be paid equal rates, and also that women are entitled to men&apos;s war advances and bonus, instead of the smaller rate allowed to women.Stoppage is threatened in the Dundee Jute Works unless dilution is stopped.The War Ofice Contracts Department has only two new disputes to report, neither being of importance;The Goal Controller has interviewed a deputation of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain regarding their claim for an increase in wages, and is in communication with the President of the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Munitions.The Committee on Production heard fifty-two cases last week, viz., forty-eight in London and four in Scotland.They included three applications for the 12^ per cent, bonus, and applications for increased rates in the hosiery and flour-milling trades.Tlie Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 192 differences for the week ending the 15th June. Most of these continue to fall in the engineerings shipbuilding, and other metal trades.   Public utility services came next.G. H. ROBERTS.o
