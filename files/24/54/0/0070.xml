mm12OPERATIONS.From     G,0.C-ivn-C, Egypt.ToWar Office.Despatched 1.30 a.m. 16.6.18. Received    1.0  p.m. 16.6.18.B.A.1539 June 15th.Your 6007c;&apos; cipher D.M.0, June 12thI consider it necessary before a final decision isarrived at to state certain factor:; which have altered the situation in this theatre and also to point out the rishcw involved in the event of the wither a-.: al of more British and Colonial troops.that I should require a considerable addition to my strength for operations beyond Jaffa-Jerusalem line and possibly even to maintain that line. It is true that the decisive nature of the battles in November and December of last year enabled me to advance rather farther than I had anticipated, but as to the number of troops required to maintain my present line I have no reason to modify my opinion.Although. I sent section of 74th Division to Prance before the arrival of the 3rd Indian Division, and in addition 9 Yeomanry Regi tents and 24 British battalions from 4 of my remaining Divisions before they were all replaced, I only consider myself justified in doing so.without comment because I consider that there was time to carry out the re-organ! sat ion-of (?) my army before the enemy could be reinforced sufficiently to attach me with any expectation of success.This consideration is nov; changed as after the harvest I believe he could maintain, exclusive of the troops in the Hejaz, 63,000 rifles and sabres on his present front, (?) that is&quot;an Increase of 26,000 on his present strength of 42,000, Towards this increase he coulc&apos; probably spare 10,^.0 rifles from western Anatolia and Cilicia and t ere appears no reason toI said in my telegram E.A.40 dated July 12th 1917
think that the balance   of 16,000 could not be providedeither from Germany and Austria or from other Turkish fronts,if troops of tho former nations were used to relieve Turkishtroops.    We must therefore reckon with the possibilitythat the rifle strength&apos;o&apos;f the enemy on this, Front may be increasedto the maximum of 68,000,The state of efficiency of Indian Battalions in view of this possibility is an important factor,     Of the 54 Battalions 22 have proved their value in war, but have each lately given up one company to form new battalions; 10 battalions, though composed of men who have seen service, are newly formed units, and the remaining 22 have seen no service and are in varying stages of training.     The recruits, of whom there are a large number, have, in some cases, not even fired a musketry course.     On the whole I am bound to say that I consider that it will be some months before the last 22 batt-alions can be considered thoroughly reliable, and to take away more British or Colonial troops involves a serious risk. 3, As 6 Infantry Divisions and 3 Mounted Divisions arerequired to hold the Jordan Bridgeheads and my present Front between the River and the Sea, I cannot make any redistribution of my troops and shall be without any Army Reserve if the 2 Divisions in question are withdrawn.    My present line is the shortest and the best I can hold.     There Is no shorter alternative line behind me to which I could withdraw unless the -Jordan Bridgeheads are given up.     This would entail the loss of the command of Dead Sea and direct communication with Sheriff. Feisal&apos;s advanced troops, whose co-operation is absolutely essential4, The loss of 2 Divisions will make it Impossible for metn give Sheriff Feisal&apos;s troops assistance ,either directly or* indirectly by pressure on my northern Front, and it is not.
i rpossiole that the enemy might toe able to regain all thoground he has lost in the northern He(jaz).    I am sure that tl:is would hava a very serious effect on the political situation in the ^ast and in particular on ths Arab movement, and might even drive .&apos;.ing Hussein into the arms of the Turk,5.        I have felt obliged to point out the risks which a reduction in tho strength of my Force will entail, but you (?) may rely on ae, if the War Cabinet decides to sanction the proposal now under discussion to do all I can to hold all the ground gained in Palestine \;it.h the troops of Indian Any which are at my disposal.U.w.X.

SECRET.0&quot;; ER AT IONS.IIFrom:-   V/ar Office.To:-     G.0.C in C, Egypt.Despatchod 10 p.m. 12.6.18.60070 Cipher D.M.O.     Proposal has been made to the War Cabinet to withdraw the equivalent of one white mcunted division (Australians) to be used as drafts for the Australian Infantry Divisions in France, and also the 54th Division complete in vidw of the necessity for concentrating every available man on the Western front to meet situation which may become critical during the next few months.Ab*mt the beginning of July shipping will be available for the 54th Division and possibly also for the Australians. As soon as the transfer has definitely been sanMicnedby the War Cabift&amp;i full details will be sent but will you please consider what redistribution of your remaining forces will be necessary to meet the above eventuality in the meantime.-H.O.X.

SECRET OPERATIONSFrom      G.O.O. -in-C, Egypt. 12th July, 1917.To O.I.G.S. 7.5 p.m-E.A. 40.I have just returned from the Palestine front and now submit my appreciation and proposals in accordance with your instructions.It appears to me that the Turkish Government have realized that the loss of Jerusalem added to the fall of Baghdad would produce disastrous results for them.     They have, therefore, determined to oppose further progress on our part to the best of their power.     The positions at present occupied by the Turks on the Gaza Becrsheba line are of considerable natural strength and from lack of water we are for the moment unable to approach within striking distance except near the sea coast in one small sector.The enemy&apos;s position runs from the sea at Gaza roughly along the main Gaza Bcershoba road to Beersheba, a distance of about 30 miles.     He is, therefore, widely dispersed but his lateral communications are good and he can very quickly reinforce any threatened point.     He has made (iasa into a strong modern fortress heavily wired and entrenched. Its centre is a mass of houses, gardens and Oaotus hedges offering every facility for protracted defence.     The rest of his line consists of a serio-3   of strong localities mostly about 150&amp; - 200C yards apart, viz; tho Sihan group of works, the Atawineh gr-uip^ the Baha group, the Abu Horeira trench system and finally the worko covering Beersheba itself.My/
2. .&apos;2*2My first impression is that the most vulnerable point in the enemy1 s lino i.!: probably the sector Horolra Irgoig whore his works are less highly organised than those directly north and where further his main system is com-pletely dominated from the higher ground between Irgeig and Beersheba.In southern Palestine the enemy&apos;s force is estimated at 5 divisions and 1 Oavalry division in the front line, with at least one additional division in reserve south of Jerusalem.     This, with unattached units, represents a total fighting force of, roughly, 46,000 rifles, 2,800 sabres, 250 machine guns and 200 guns.     As regards reinforcements tho 26th Division   is definitely reported en route to Palestine also ono regiment of the 46th Division.I have immediately available against his force 4 divisions and 3 cavalry divisions, exclusive of the 60th Division,   which Is In procoss of equipment on arrival from Salonika and the 75th Division, which, for some months,will bo unfit to take the field.     Units are, however, below strength and to complete the 4 divisions and mounted troops now in the line to full strength I no?/ require 5,150 Infantry and 400 Yeomanry reinforcements.In the above figures the reinforce ents of the Infantry of the 60th Division,   7/hich is only now arriving, and of the battalions of the 75th Division now In this country are not included.     I estimate them at about another 2,000   -men.At present it does not appear to have been decided Generalby the Turko-German/staff whether their offensive in Asia Minor shall be made against Baghdad or on the Palestine front.     It seems that the decision will probably bo. in .favour of an offensive campaign against Baghdad.     Myown/
own view as regards Turkish intention in Palestine- is that the?/ will romain generally on the defensive, and will confine any offensive that may be undertaken to an attempt, whioh I can frustrate, to drive us back to the Egyptian frontier.     The railway line east of the canal can supply 7 divisions, 3 Oavalry divisions and the necessary proportion of army troops.     With this force 1 could now undertake an offensive with a reasonable prospect of success, but the divisions must be fully equipped and maintained at full strength.     At the end of this telegram my requirements, in addition tn whet I have now at my disposal, are enumerated.     In the 7 divisions referred to above I do not include the 75th Division, which has as yet no artillery and only 9 battolions of infantry, and which, owing to tho weakened state of tho battalions, will not be ready to take the field till December at the carliost*    Assuming that the enemy&apos;s force in front of me is not materially increased, I should hope, with 7 divisions and 3 Oavalry divisions, to bo able to take Q-aza and Ecersheba.     1 might also bo able to reach Jerusalem.     For any operations beyond the Jaffc -Jerusalem line, and perhaps to maintain that line, I shall need a considerable addition to my strength.     This will necessitate the doubling of the railway east of the Canal which should be at once undertaken.     It would take about 6 months from tho commencement of work to double the line to Rafa.     Therefore the sooner the line is doubled the better, as such a line will certainly be required.     This will also Involve the doubling of the pipe line.     It is important that I should have the troops I ask for ready for an advance in September, so as to anticipate the October rains; otherwise operations on a large scale could not well bo commenced before November 1st,     If it is impossible &quot;uving to thorequirements/
requirements of other theatres to send me the troops I ask fir, minor operations only will he possible.    With 6 divisions end 3 Cavalry Divisions which, a pert from tho 75th Division, represents my present strength, I could only expect to achieve local successes.     In this theatre groat possibilities are before us, but beyond taking any steps necessary to improve my present position, I think it would bo an error to u-idortako minor operations with weak forces.As regards the organization of my Palostino force I propose tn form 2 Oorps and 1 Cavalry Corps, all thrco directly undor G.H.Q.     To onablo mo to control these Corps in the field I have decided to divide my Headquarters. Tho major part will move to the neighbourhood of Khan Yunio while tho remainder, comprising representatives of Administrative Services and Departments and such portions of my Staff as aro required to deal with tho administrative and political questions involved in tho control of Egypt and the administration of martial law, will romaln in Cairo, In a subsequent tologram which will bo despatched at an early date, 1 will forward my detailed proposals together with the Oommanders and Staffs required under this roorgan-ization.     I hope also, In due course, to forward to you a report on man-power.     My immediate requirements arc as follows :-A.     Division.   2 fully trained divisions, each with&apos; 36 IB pounder and 12 4.5&quot; howitzers, D.A.C. and with 3 light (Stokes) and 3 modium (2&quot;) Trench Mortar batteries.B*     Artillery.   1. Field Artillery:    I consider all divisions in this theatre should have 36 18-pounders and 12 4,5&quot; howitzers.     I therefore require to complete my present divisions 8 4-gun 4.5&quot; howitzer batteries,.    32 howitzers. 5 6-gun 18-pounder batteries,    30 guns.&apos;&apos;2, Heavy/
&apos;2. Heavy Artillory.     In heavy andsic go artillery I estimate my requirements to bo in theproportion of 4 Co-pounders, 8 6&quot; howitzers to 8ft howitzers4 A. An guns per division and in addition 1 A, A. Section foreach kite balloon section.     Therefore, in addition toheavy artillery already arrived or promised, totalling 266&quot; howitzers, 4 8&quot; howitzers, 24 60-poundcrs and 14 A.A.guns, I require the following:- 2 60-pounder batteries,8 guns; 0:1 6&quot; howitzer batteries, 38 howitzers; 3 8&quot;howitzer batteries, 12 howitzers; 13 A.A. sections 26 guns(includes 8 for kite balloon sections).     These figuresInclude heavy and A.A. artillery for 75th Division.     I shouldalso be glad of 4 6&quot; mark 7 guns.     This heavy artilleryto he organised In 6 groups for which, in addition to the3 now formed or promised, 3 additional group Headquarterswill be required.tf.   Aircraft.     Under tho new organisation I estimate mytotal requirements to be not less than 5 squadrons, onefor each of my 3 Dorps, one fighting Squadron and one forG.H.Q.     I regard this as a matter of vital importance ast - employ my heavy artillery to the best advantage I mustensure command of the airy and I must have machines of theL&apos; test types, as I cannot continue to be opposed by enemymachines superior to my ^m.     My requirements are, therefore3 additional squadrons, plus one flight to replace the flightdetached from one of my present squadrons for service inthe Hedjaz.Signal?D.   Secret Service.     I require immediately 2 complete Corps Signal Companies with horse transport and 1 heavy artillery signal section, also 2 wireless sections of Corps Signal Company.     Towards these I am prepared to form 1 Corps Signal Company and the heavy artillery signal section fr^m recently arrived reinforcements and men withdrawn fromother/
other arms and trained here.     Signal personnel to replace reinforcements absorbed by the formation of these units will,- however, be required immediately.     We shall &apos; therefore require fr^m another theatre 1 complete horsed Corps Signal Company and the 2 southern sections of Corps Signal Company.E. R.E. Service.     1 shall require 2 army tr&quot;^?s companies R.E, to meet increased wrk ^n the L.      0.F. Medical. m. et the incrocso In my forces my medical requirements are 2 General Hospitals, 2 Stationary Hospitals, 2 Casualty Clearing Stations,4 Sanitary Sections, in addition to units already promised or despatched,     As regards the abovo demands (with the exception of -inc 60-p^undcr or 6&quot;&apos; howitzer battery per division, which should bo horsed), all units should be sent fully horsed and heavy artillery units complete v&apos;ith tractors and caterpillar trucks.
