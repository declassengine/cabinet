We now know, for certain, from the Muhlon revelations that the group of men who provoked the war in 1914 consisted not only of soldiers but of industrial magnates, such as Herr Krupp von Boblen. On the other hand, it may be taken as equally certain that the larger section of the German business community which depended for its livelihood on overseas trade, was opposed to the war policy of the military chiefs, and hoped to the last that a conflict with Britain, at any rate, might be avoided. They realised that Germany was more dependent than any other country in the world on foreign raw materials and markets for her prosperity, and that, in a war against the dominant sea-power, that prosperity would be a hostage in the hands of her enemy.One of the greatest and most successful of German business magnates, Dr. Walter Rathenau, chairman of the Allgemeine Elektrizitatsgesellschaft, has described in a recent book* the misgivings that were stirred in his mind by the cheering crowds in the streets of Berlin in July 1914, On the whole, however, the German business community accepted the war in the same spirit of military enthusiasm as the rest of the country. They expected a short war, which would leave their overseas connections unimpaired, and, as we now know, the representatives of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, who attended a conference at the Ministry of the Interior at Berlin in May 1914, to concert economic measures in the event of war, came hack with the report that plans were being laid for a war of a year&apos;s duration at the outside.!After the battle of the Marne, it begun to be generally recognised that the war would be a long one, and that it could not fail to inflict untold damage on Germany&apos;s oversea trade and. connections. The German Government realised that, in transferring its contest with Great Britain from the commercial to the military sphere, it had jeopardised the future prosperity of the country. Efforts were therefore made to prove that the war was provoked by British jealousy, and Dr. Bethmann-Hollweg laid constant stress in his speeches on &quot;the safeguarding of Germany&apos;s economic future &quot; as one of the most essential war aims.As the war has gone on, the necessity of &quot; safeguarding Germany&apos;s economic future &quot; has become more and more apparent, and the means proposed for doing so have taken different shapes. This must be briefly reviewed if the present situation is to be understood.There have throughout been two schools of thought on the subject of economic war aims. These are sometimes described as &quot; Eastern &quot; and &quot; Western,&quot; but they would be more correctly called &quot;Continental&quot; and &quot;Oceanic.&quot; The Continental school, consisting of the&apos; agrarians and certain industrial interests, aim at acquisitions of territory and wealth in the Old World. The Oceanic school, which draws its main strength, from the commercial and general manufacturing community, aims at strengthening the influence and trading connections of Germany in the world as a whole. The first school marches under the banner of &quot; Mitteleuropa,&quot; which has been stretched to cover far more territory than the name implies; the second has adopted as its watchword &quot; Weltwirtschaft,&quot; or &quot; World Economy.&quot;These two sets of aims are not incompatible. There is no party in Germany except the diminishing group of Minority Socialists, which, in the event of victory, would not be ready to exploit both sets of aims to the full.   The difference between* &quot;Von kommenden Dingen,&quot; written in the summer of 1916.t Statement by a speaker at a. Conference on the 7th August, 1916, in defence of the Government against the charge of industrial unpreparedueis.[367-20] B
their exponents is as to their relative importance : as to which, in the event of a negotiated peace, should be regarded as pawns for bargaining, and which, should be insisted upon as indispensable. In this great and sustained debate, which has occupied the mind of Germany for close on four years, the exponents of the Oceanic point of view, with, the blockade to drive home their arguments, have completely succeeded in proving their case.The extent and significance of this victory may be judged by a comparison between the state of opinion in 191.5 and at the present time- During the summer and autumn of 191.5, when Warsaw, Vilna, and Kovuo were occupied and the connection established wtth Bulgaria and Asia Minor, when Naumann&apos;s attractive exposition of &quot; Mitteleuropa&quot; ran into 100,000 copies in a few months, the vast new territories opened up seemed full of boundless possibilities. But before long the professors, who had been set on to make the inventory, began to produce their results, which proved unexpectedly meagre. Disappointment set in, and by the spring of 1916, when the blockade was beginning to be very severely felt, the Oceanic school was again in the ascendant. Its ascendency has never been so marked as during the last three months, when, by the treaties with Russia and the Ukraine a new door has been opened into the depths of Asia, and possibilities of expansion have been presented excelling the utmost dreams of 1915. Never has the gospel of &quot; World Economy&quot; been so loudly proclaimed, or attention been drawn so frankly to the dependence of Germany on her overseas connections, and to the control exercised over her future prosperity and her very means of existence by the dominant sea-power. Amidst the multitude of witnesses a few authoritative pronouncements only can be cited.On the 9th April, five weeks after the Russian treaties had been signed, Dr. Helfferich, who is generally believed in Germany to be the controlling mind behind the Governments economic policy and plans, made a speech at Stuttgart, in the presence of the whole body of VYurttemburg Ministers. It contained not a word about the Eastern situation, but consisted of one long harangue against &quot; England &quot; as the instigator of the war and the evil genius of European history. Rejecting the idea of &quot; peace by understanding,&quot; he declared that the sword alone could secure to . Germany the economic peace-terms indispensable to her continued existence. He denned the economic position and needs of Germany with almost brutal frankness in the following words :  &quot; Before the wrar the labour and livelihood of more than a quarter of our 70,000,000 inhabitants arose directly or indirectly out of our foreign connections. .... Only the restoration and safeguarding of our place in the world&apos;s economy, the restoration and safeguarding of our foreign connections and foreign establish-ments can save us from a long continued shortage of raw materials and foodstuffs, from unemployment, low wages, and misery.   It is not to protect our frontiersthat we are fighting ; it is to protect the foundations of our existence.....Wemay maintain and safeguard our frontiers, but if the peace does not restore to us what the British economic war has destroyed, if it does not recover for us free play for our work and enterprise in the outer world and that not by means of paper agreements, but through the compelling power of facts which we ourselves have set in motion if we do not insist upon this as a result of our military successes, then this cannot be said too often we have lost the war and with it our future. Then we have played for our stakes and lost them ; we shall be suffocated ; with our population diminished and our standard of life reduced, we shall be thrust back into the misery and weakness of bygone days.&quot;The same moral recurs in the address delivered by Herr von Kuhlmann before the Berlin Chamber of Commerce on the 22nd May. It was announced as a lecture on &quot; The Economic Aspect of the Roumanian Peace,&quot; and the greater part of the address was devoted to that subject. But in a concluding passage the speaker took pains to make it clear that his experiences in the East have left him a convinced adherent of the Oceanic school.&quot; It would be a grave mistake,&quot; he said, &quot; were we to direct our gaze only to the East and the South-East. These developments are necessary in order to broaden the basis of our economic structure on the European continent, to furnish us with population and resources for the peaceful competition of the future against great territories like North America. But they are not the goal or the end of our evolution. All our efforts to unify our resources and consolidate our basis on our own mother earth the European continent-must only be allowed to serve, in the
last analysis, as a stimulus,to.German enterprise to put forth, yet stronger efforts towards that which is the native element of all great and genuinely free trade  the free sea.&quot;Here the contemplated relationship between continental and oceanic policy is quite frankly revealed. Mitteleuropa is regarded as an accomplished fact. Europe can be described, without fear of contradiction from Germany&apos;s satellites, as the mother earth (&quot; Mutterboden &quot;) of the German business man. But these vast annexations of land, labour, and resources are but a preliminary to the main and indispensable economic war aim.....the resumption and safeguarding of Germany&apos;s oversea connections.Side by side with these pronouncements by the two men most intimately concerned with the drawing up of Germany&apos;s economic war aims may be set demands put forward in responsible quarters, giving precision to the necessarily vague statements of the governmental speakers.The first to be cited must be the one definite war-aims programme so far drawn up by the legislature of one of the federated States. On the 16th May the &quot; Citizen Council,&quot; or Lower House, of the free city of Hamburg, passed a resolution begging the Senate, or Upper House, to use its influence with the Bundesrat to secure that the following points should be taken into consideration in the negotiation of the future peace treaties :-1. A sufficient war indemnity, preferably in the shape of raw materials. 2. A larger colonial Empire adequate to the needs of the German people. 3. The guaranteeing of German claims in foreign countries. 4. The restoration of all German rights in foreign countries infringed as a result of the Avar.5. Protection against attempts to boycott German enterprise.6. Safeguards assuring equal rights to German shipping on the seas of the world.The reasons which impelled the Hamburg community to frame this resolution are obvious enough ; but this incursion into imperial politics by a local legislature is clear evidence of the widespread uneasiness which prevails at the situation in which the German commercial -community finds itself after four years of war. So great has this uneasiness become, that the Reichstag has recently taken the unprecedented step of sending a delegation to Hamburg to confer on the situation.The same preoccupations reappear at the recent meeting of the German Associated Chambers of Commerce, at which a resolution was adopted in the following terms : -&quot; It must be pointed out with all possible emphasis that all difficulties as to the supply of raw materials after the war and the improvement of the German exchange abroad will be surmounted, at one stroke and without any artificial interference with the economic life of the nation, if the forthcoming treaties of peace secure us a war indemnity of adequate dimensions, and if part of this is paid in raw materials, or if the supply of raw materials is guaranteed to us in some other way. The Imperial Government is requested resolutely to present this demand at the peace negotiations still outstanding.&quot;This programme, as will be observed, embodies an ingenious combination of predatory militarism and &quot; business as usual.&quot; The securing of an indemnity by military force is to be made the occasion for the removal of all State restrictions on private trading.A similar point of view was in evidence at a meeting of the Hansabund, an association of general trading and manufacturing interests, on the 30th April, when great stress was laid, on the necessity for complete freedom of action for German enter-prise, both as regards shipping and general trade after the war. The chief speaker, Dr. Kohler, the business manager of the association, declared that the conclusion of peace would signify not the end but the beginning of the struggle for the economic and political position of the German Empire in the world, and suggested &apos;: the Oceans for Germans &quot; as the watchword of the association^ policy. He went on to argue in favour of this &quot; world activity &quot; being exercised under conditions of complete freedom of movement and of enterprise, a point of view which was emphasised by subsequent speakers representing the shipping and textile interests. One of these, Herr Hulder-mann, managing director of the Ham burg-America Line, revealed his preoccupations h   in the following significant sentences : &quot; Under present circumstances peace treaties may not be worth the paper they are written on, for we have to reckon with the personal inclinations of foreign[307-20] B 2
nations. What will the most excellent peace treaties avail us if the nations unite in a voluntary boycott of Germany, and make our labours impossible by unfair customs and police regulations ? &quot;Meanwhile the new -Imperial Ministry of Industry, which has been specially -entrusted with the preparations for Germany&apos;s economic reconstruction after the war, has been examining the question from its own special angle, and has lately drawn the public to some extent into its confidence. At a meeting in Frankfurt on the 14th April Dr. Weber, one of the chief officials of the Ministry, addressing the Union of South German Manufacturers, defended the control policy of the Government on the ground that, &quot; even if the Government pitched its economic demands as high as possible in the future peace negotiations, and even if, in particular, it demanded the granting of currency loans and the signing of contracts for the delivery of raw materials, it is impossible at the present time to forecast the condition of affairs after the signing of peace.&quot; In the debate on the estimates of the new Department on the 3rd May the Minister himself was more outspoken : &quot; I do not,&quot; he said, &quot; take our enemies for a lot of old women. If they are constantly threatening us with an economic war 1 am disposed to take their words seriously. We must therefore arm ourselves with every weapon that will enable us to withstand them on this field also.  For that reason imports and exports mustremain under Government control.....   At a time wfien there is a shortage ofraw materials, and much else that is required for our industrial life, decisions must be made as to the purposes to which they shall be applied. Somebody must decide as to what is necessary and what is not. The interested parties are not in a position to do so. It is not their business, which is to make the most of what opportunities they have. Only one authority can decide, and that is the Govern-ment.&quot;On the 4th May a further declaration of reconstruction policy was made by means of an interview between officials of the new department and representatives of the press. No attempt was made to disguise the seriousness of the position, and especial stress was laid on the difficulties which would confront the textile industry, which, it should be remembered, employs over a million work-people in the German Empire.*&quot; Germany,&quot; said one of the speakers, &quot;will have to count on a shortage of raw material for a long time. Cotton crops are less abundant and the demand has increased. In America only 13,000,000 bales were harvested in .1917, as compared with 18-,000,000&apos; in 1913&apos;, while the demand there has gone up from 5*4,000,000 to 7&apos;6;000,000. As England has already purchased the South African and Australian output for several years, wool will be almost entirely under her control. Moreover, the Egyptian cotton crop has also been secured by England for the next two years and jute will also be controlled from there.&quot;Similarly pessimistic language was used about tonnage : &quot; A large proportion of German tonnage has been lost during the war and further losses may yet occur. It appears to be impossible during the war to make good these/losses in German shipyards, and therefore one must reckon with a reduced German tonnage as well as with a general reduction of international tonnage. No one can prophesy, but it is very probable that there will not be enough tonnage for the necessary imports.&quot;The conclusion drawn by the department was that both shipping and trade must continue to be controlled, but that the conditions of the control must depend on the nature of the peace settlement. &quot; The more favourable Germany&apos;s position is on the conclusion of peace, the less stringently will these measures be applied.&quot;Quotations could be multiplied indefinitely to show the extent to which these pre-occupations as to the economic future of the country are exercising the minds of all classes in Germany. The professors, in particular many of whom were at first attracted by the lure of &quot; Mitteleuropa,&quot; are now singing in chorus in the opposite camp; led by some of the very men who were set on to specialise in &quot;Continental&quot; possibilities, and have been prominent in promoting schemes of closer economic union in the Near East.   Articles on &quot; the threatened raw material boycott&quot; are now* 1,088,280 in census of 1907.
constantly appearing in German newspapers and reviews ; and this is all the more striking because, up till about a year ago, the German Government seems to have tried to prevent the discussion of the subject, lest the realisation of the seriousness of the position should cause discouragement. One feature of these discussions, however, deserves especial notice. This is the increasing tendency among sections of the most diverse opinion to advocate a settlement of the economic issues of the war by means of international organisation rather than by a victory achieved at the point of the sword, as foreshadowed by the military party. . Several striking pronouncements in this sense have been made recently. The&apos; most comprehensive of these is an article contributed by Dr. Dernburg to the Vienna &quot; Neue Freie Presse&quot; of the 19th May. He begins by painting the economic outlook of the Central Powers in gloomy colours : &quot; Even if we recovered the German colonies and a good slice of the rest of Africa besides, the Central Powers could not meet their demand for raw material. Very few neutral States remain to help us out. Neither Sweden nor Spain nor the Dutch colonies can give us what we need, useful though their contributions are. The rest of the world, with the exception of. Mexico, Argentine, and Chile, has joined our enemies ; and since all these States retain sovereign powers to regulate their imports and exports in any way they please, there is nothing to prevent them from prolonging their war-time legislation into time of peace. England and her Dominions have already shown the way in this direction.&quot;He goes on to point out that, even if the Peace Treaty provides safeguards against such legislative action, it is a mistake to suppose, as is commonly supposed in Germany, &quot; that the whole world will be only too pleased to enter into business relations with the Central Powers.&quot; This is certainly not true of England and France, still less of the Dominions. It is therefore not a question of &quot; securing permission &quot; for the free use of the seas and the delivery of raw materials. Compulsory powers must be provided in case of need to make sure that the Central Powers get their due. This compulsion, he continues &quot; Can only be exercised as the result of an agreement between all the sovereign States to set up an International Rationing Commission armed with powers of judicial decision, which will be empowered to allocate, transport, and payfor the materials on the basis of standards pi&quot;eviously laid down.....Thedetermination of the quotas will be difficult, but more difficult questions have been known to be settled. What this will mean in practice is that a very large part of the merchant shipping of the world will be plying under a single control, that a long list of materials will be drawn up, and the individual States will be asked, and, if necessary, compelled, to deliver the products of their own territory for the&apos;benefit of the world as a whole, so that a general settlement will be brought about between commodities and money. In other words, the distribution of raw materials and of a portion of the articles of consumption will remain in Government hands for a period which, though it will be as short as possible, will not be inconsiderable.&quot;The article concludes by summing up the proposed international economic organisation as &quot; a League of Peoples for the Universal Provision of a Humanity pining for Want of Raw Materials.&quot;The putting forward of so bold and comprehensive a suggestion by a politician of Herr Dernburg&apos;s standing would be remarkable enough in any event, but it is all the more remarkable in view of the disinclination hitherto of Germans of all sections of opinion to pay serious attention to questions of international organisation or the League of Nations. Still more remarkable is the statement of peace-terms contributed, to the Junker organ, the &quot; Kreuz-Zeitung,&quot; by an anonymous writer on the 5th June, which includes a demand for &quot; German participation in international commissions of control for all spheres of economic interest in lieu of an actual war indemnity.&quot; Men like Dr. Dernburg and the &quot; Kreuz-Zeitung &quot; writer have clearly been driven, contrary to their own natural bent of mind, to advocate international organisation, because they can see no other prospect of relief from Germany&apos;s inevitable post-war embarrassments.The practical conclusion which emerges from the foregoing may be briefly stated: It is important to strengthen, with every means at disposal, the machinery of economic control in the hands of the Allies, and, more particularly, of the British.
Empire. . The Germans, as has been shown, rate the potency of the economic weapon very high ; in some cases, as appears in the extracts quoted above, they have even allowed their apprehensions to outrun their information and announced as a fait accompli policies designed to secure.the control of important materials for several years ahead, which are not yet known to have been, and perhaps have not been, adopted by the Governments concerned. It may be stated with absolute confidence, from a close study of German opinion, that nothing would do more to encourage the enemy at this moment than any suspicion that there existed reluctance on the Allies&apos; side to perfect their machinery of joint economic organisation, irrespective of private, local, or national interests, or to adopt the measures of purchase, control, and unification necessary to render that organisation effective for several years ahead.Inseparably bound up with this, however, is the question of the economic aspect of the post-war settlement. It must never be forgotten that the economic issue is by far the best leverage at our disposal for influencing German opinion. The German public is not interested at this moment in programmes designed to &quot;make the world safe for democracy,&quot; or, indeed, in any of the political ideas put forward on either side of the Atlantic in connection with the peace settlement. But it is vitally and anxiously interested in questions of economic policy, for upon their settlement depends the prospect of a restoration of domestic comfort and national prosperity. Great and not unnatural confusion exists among the German public at present as to the economic policy of the Allies, and this has enabled the military party to whip up much lagging support. If it were made perfectly clear that the Allies intended to use the economic weapon to its fullest extent in order to achieve their declared purposes, including full reparation, but to use it no further, it would have a far more disintegrating effect upon German opinion than any statement of purposes hitherto issued from the Allied side.o
