Colonel W. Dally Joues, /&amp;149tS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS ERITAMIC IuAJESTY&apos;S GOTOflMEflTS-soret war cabinet.,,!P .4839--committee on QovMmmm og ikelamp bill.Interim Heport.The Committee appointed &quot;by the Cabinet has carried out its work oi preparing a Home Rule Bill to a stage at which it considers it necessary to lay the position which it has reached before the Cabinet for the purpose of further instructions as to procedure.After the first meetings of the Committee, it will be remembered, tho question of the right method of procedure was submitted to the Cabinet and it was decided that the Colonial Secretary should, with the assistance which ho required, proceed to frame a Draft Bill to be submitted to tho Cabinet for its considoration.    At the same time the Committee itself agreed to the appointment of a Sub^oaamittotr^ to consider the particular question of Stance.The Sub-Committee on Finance has carried its enquiries as far as is of value at the present time, and has framed two -alternativo schemes:   Scheme A follows closely the recommendations of the. Convention, namely, while reserving customs and excise to the Imperial Parliament, hands over to the Irish Parliament all other taxes and makes provision for Land and Housing on the lines of the Reports presented by the Convention.    Scheme B differs frfcm Scheme A in thatfl) it reserves inoome tax, super-tax and excess profits duty to the Imperial Parliament^(2) instead of as in A providing for a contribution from the Irish Exchequer to the Imperial Exchequer, it proposes that the Irsporial Exchequer should contribute rto the Irish Bxohequor an annual sum representing the difference between the present cost of administration of Irish ser-vices and the present yiold of the transferred taxes, with subsequent additions for any services transferred at a later date;   and(3) it provides that the land purchased or about to be pur-c!hased under tho Land Purchase Act should be handed over as a free gift to Ireland - the revenue derived therefrom being available for current expenditure and the capital for purposes of capital expenditure.Apart from finance the draft prepared by the Secretary of State for the Colonies provides a frame-work which has followed the lines of the Chairman*s Report to the Convention, except as regards one important matter in which, in pursuit of a suggestion conveyed in tho Prime Ministers lotter of February 25th 1918 to the Chairman of tho Convention, safe-guards to Ulster are sought through&apos; tho establishment of an Ulster Committee, with powers to exclude the application tt Ulsfcor of legislative or administrative measures and to con-trol administration and appointments in Ulster.    On tho ques-tion of the judiciary, on which no spooific recommendations different from 1914 Act were made by the Convention, special provisions have been made to moot Ulstor feeling.
Before proceeding further with the consideration of the Draft Bill, the Committee, at their meeting on June 4th, disoussed the general situation as regards Ireland.The Chairman and the Chief Secretary laid before the Committee the conclusions they had independently arrived at as a result of their recent investigation into Irish affairs. Briefly they hold that owing (l) to the threatened but happily averted Sinn Fein Rebellion;   (2) to the marching and drilling which throughout a great part of Ireland is becoming the invariable practice of the younger men;   and (3) to the various acta of illegality, such as raiding houses for arms, assaults upon individuals, intimidation and the illegal possession and storing of high explosives - the condition of the eountry calls for, and is indeed receiving, the vigorous treatment of which instances have recently appeared in the Press.    They both concur in the view that at the present time it is impossible to give effect to the dual policy or the Government.The Committee concurred in the conclusion described above and held that it is useless to proceed with the drafting of the Bill until the Cabinet as ia whole have considered the general question.    They did not conceal from themselves the gravity of the decision which the Government have to take, but it is clear, in view of the new information which has come into the possession of the Government as to the disturbed state of Ireland and as to the effect of priestly denunciations upon the polioe, that the immediate enforcement of conscription is impossible,    Even if circumstances had permitted it, the proclamations issued by the Irish Government would prevent that course from being taken now. It is equally clear that the same circumstances destroy for the time being the chance of any agreed settlement of the question of Irish Government.    The lawlessness whivh prevents conscription is itself the strongest argument against the establishment of a Government dependent on the support of a population so utterly out of hand, whilst the effeot of the agitations of the last few weeks has been to increase the hostility of Ulster and to strengthen the Ulster case, to alienate the moderate Unionists of the south and west and to destroy the prospect of their support and finally to leave the Nationalists without influence or authority and at the same time in open resistance to the measures which the Government declare necessary for the conduct of the war.The Committee feel strongly that a definite statement ought to be made in Parliament as soon as is possible, but that it is essential to define clearly the immediate and future policy of the Government.    It seems clear that, as stated above, it is impossible to proceed at present with the dual policy owing to the existing state of Ireland and to the heavy task thrown upon the Executive of restoring respect for the law. Meanwhile there are two courses of procedure open to the Government.    We shall be willing, if instructed to do so, to resume the consideration of the Draft Bill, which we were eailed upon to prepare, in order that the Government may be in ft position to prove their bona fides by showing that they have a Bill upon the stocks*
Alternatively some of our number are of opinion that the question cannot be satisfactorily solved, and indeed that the Draft Bill cannot be effectively proceeded with, except by considering the case of Irish government as part of the wider problem of a Federal constitution for the United Kingdom as a whole;   and they would prefer that the case of Ireland and an Irish Bill should be postponed for. the present, but only on the understanding that a Commission be set up to investigate the Federal solution in its bossible application to every part of the United Kingdfciw . ;The Committe therefore ask the cabinet to instruct them, and venture! to express the hope that there may be a.general discussion in order that a definite decision may be arrived at, which will enable a statement to be made in Parliament.    In view of the fact that ho Bill can be Introduced at present it seems highly undesirable without such further instructions to continue the Meetings of the Committee which lead the Public to believe that a Bill will shortly be introduced.(Intd), W.H.L.14th. June, 1918.
