BULGARIA.DURING- the last six months there has been no radical change in the political situation in Bulgaria. All the same there have been interesting developments of some of the tendencies which were pointed out in the initial report on Bulgaria, issued on the 10th December last by the Intelligence Bureau of the Department of Information, and this as regards foreign policy, internal politics, and economic difficulties.1. An attempt was there made to explain the prevalence and strength of the chauvinist policy which has prevailed in Bulgaria during the last few years. Bulgarians, or rather the ruling forces in Bulgaria, which alone counted, saw in an alliance with the Central Powers the one certain method of securing their own hegemony in the Balkans While suspicious of German policy they were not unduly frightened of it, for they believed that Imperial Russia would always be at hand to forgive a penitent Bulgaria, and that Bulgaria, by a skilful manipulation of her cards, could play Hoherizollern against Romanov, and vice versa. This belief, indeed, was shaken by the Russian Revolution of March 1917, but the full consequences for Bulgaria of that revolution were not at once apparent. It was thought that the Provisional Government, which included such a &quot; friend of Bulgaria &quot; as Milyukov, would hasten to procure peace on terms not iuacceptable to Bulgaria, and that a drawn war would leave Bulgaria, by admission of both sides, in possession of what she had gained by the help of one of them. The second, Bolshevik, Revolution of November produced a novel change in the situation. It is true that in a sense it was welcomed by Bulgarian opinion, as it was considered a further step in the direction of peace, and the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk were hailed with delight. But the final result of the Russo-German negotiations was to leave Germany in undisputed control, at least for. the moment, of Eastern Europe, and Bulgaria had the mortification of discovering that she was no longer of such importance to her over-powerful ally as she originally supposed.   Definite proof of this she found in the peace of Bucarest.In it z report of last December, already referred to, the Bulgarian war aims were set out at some length. It was there explained that Bulgaria attached great importance to the annexation of the whole of Dobrogea. At a moment when Bulgarian support was very necessary to the Germans, German politicians had not hesitated to tempt. Bulgaria with this bait. But in the final terms of the Treaty of Bucarest, Bulgaria, to her disgust, was awarded only a part of this booty. She was indeed returned all that portion of Southern Dobrogea which she had lost to Roumania in 1913 and to this considerable &quot; frontier rectifications &quot; were added, bringing her boundary practically up to the Cernavoda-Constantsa Railway. But the rest of Dobrogea, from Trajans wall up to the St. George&apos;s mouth of the Danube, while it was taken away from Rumania, was not handed over to Bulgaria, in spite of the feverish attempts that Bulgarian propagandists had been making during the past year by erecting schools, churches, and political clubs, throughout the province, to give it a Bulgarian character. There is no doubt that the Central Powers are not anxious to hand over at once to Bulgaria a powerful pawn which they hope to use to influence Bulgarian policy on certain points on which it is at present obdurate. The two chief points are these:  (a.) That Bulgaria should agree to the repeal of the agreement of 1915 with Turkey by which the latter country, in order to procure Bulgarian inter-vention in the war, handed over to her a considerable strip of territory just to the west of Adrianople running right down the right bank of the Maritsa.(6.) That Bulgaria should take over as permanent debt to Germany all the sums of money and munitions and other material supplied to her to bring about and to make effective her intervention in the war.As to both these points Bulgarian opinion got extremely excited, for it is maintained that Germany is going back on solemn agreements made three years ago, on the basis, of which alone Bulgaria entered the war. All parties and newspapers in Bulgaria, with the exception of the Government press, voice the determination not to accept the conditions put forward, and even Ministers like M. Tonchev, the Germanophil Minister of Finance, have been compelled to assure the Bulgarian public that Germany has
made no such conditions, and that the whole of Dobrogea will before long be freely handed over to Bulgaria. There is, none the less, at present considerable friction between Bulgaria and her Austro-German allies, and still more between Bulgaria and Turkey, and of this at the proper moment advantage will be taken by the Entente Powers. The visits of Herr von Kuhlmann and the Emperor Charles to Sofia lately were undertaken with a view to allaying this unrest, but they were only in part successful.Bulgarians are still very dissatisfied with the continued intrigues of King Constantine in Switzerland with Germany, for they are afraid that Germany is intending at the proper moment to -replace him on the Greek throne, and to force Bulgaria to hand back Greek Eastern Macedonia to King Constantine as a reward for his fidelity to the Central Alliance.Gver three territorial questions, then Dobrogea, the Maritsa boundary, and Greek-Macedonia there are all the elements for a bitter quarrel between Bulgaria and her Austro-German Allies. At the same time it should not be forgotten that on the bigger question of the retention of three-quarters of the Kingdom of Serbia, including the important Morava Valley, which will link Bulgaria directly with Hungary, Bulgarians may well feel assured that their demands will meet with every satisfaction from Germany and Austria-Hungary, who have no scruples as to the partition and annihilation of a small and independently-miuded country like Serbia.Interesting developments in Bulgaro-German relations may be shortly expected, especially if Cjermany&apos;s present offensive on the Western front finally proves unsuccessful.2. The position of the parties in Bulgaria remains what it was, as described in the report already quoted. The real Opposition continues to be made up of a small group of Radicals, the two Agrarian parties, and the &quot; Narrow &quot; (Internationalist) Socialists. There is little doubt as to the growing strength of this Opposition to the Radoslavov Government. The Agrarian organ,&quot; Zemedelsko Znaine &quot; (&quot; Agricultural Standard &quot;), is not allowed to circulate amongst the troops, and various Cabinet Ministers have spoken bitterly against the action of evil-minded persons who are seeking to debauch the fidelity of Bulgarian soldiers. There are even signs that in political circles the point of view of these Agrarians and Socialists, which Avas originally in a great minority, has made considerable progress. In the event of favourable military and political developments abroad, there can be little doubt that this way of thinking, which is growing to be that of the man in the street, or rather the man on the farm in Bulgaria, will prove, if assured of adequate support from the Entente Powers, strong enough to attack and overthrow the present rulers of the country.3. Political unrest is, moreover, founded not so much on any acute political thinking as on a natural feeling of discontent at the indefinite prolongation of a war which the Bulgarians were informed would only last six months. Further, though the food question is not so critical a one as in Germany, Austria, or even certain neutral countries, it is none the less a perpetual source of irritation to the population of the country. The widespread discontent witli the forcible requisition of fooclstuffs necessitated by the peasants&apos; continuous hoarding of their stocks brought about the resignation of the Food Controller, General Protogerov, at the end of March. The Government was compelled to admit the seriousness of the situation, and M. Radoslavov himself in the Sabraniye confessed that during the three months before the ingathering of the harvest Bulgaria would be 100,000 tons of cereals short. It was hoped that these supplies might be made up from the booty procured in the Ukraine and Rumania, in the former of which Bulgaria had been promised a 5 per cent, share. It has long since, however, become known that no such large supplies were forthcoming from these countries, and especially the Ukraine, and the shortage at present therefore remains.All these inconveniences have their value in disquieting Bulgarian opinion, Avhich tends naturally to put the blame on the Government and its friends the Germans. All the same, diis unrest, though potentially valuable to us, must not be exaggerated from the point of view of an actual political factor, for Bulgarians generally still believe in Germany&apos;s victory. When at the beginning of April the Government asked for a vote of 2,000,000,000 leva (80,000,0001) in order to cover all the advances made by the Central Powers to Bulgaria during the last three years, though there was. considerable criticism of this new step in the Sabraniye, the proposal was passed. It is, however, well to bear in mind these various tendencies in Bulgarian politics, for in the future (how soon it is impossible to say) events elsewhere may make them of much more than of merely local interest.
DENMARK.The elections to the new &quot;Landting&quot; (Upper House) took place on the 11th May, and resulted in a reduction of the Opposition (Liberals and Conservatives) majority of 42 to 16, and this in a House of 72 members as compared to (56 in the old &quot; Landting.&quot;The figures were : Liberals    ... .-     ... ... ... ... 26Conservatives ... ... ... ... 18Socialists   ... ... ... ...        .... 15Radicals    ... ... ... ... ... 13The members of the &quot; Landting &quot; are chosen by an electoral college. The electors were voted for on the 30th April with the folio wing, results : Liberals    ... ... ... ... ... 935Social-Democrats     ... ... ... ... ...    896Conservatives ... ... ...        .... ...     582Radicals    ... ... ... ... ... ...    503The comparative strengthening of the position of the Government is due principally to the fact that in the urban districts, which voted for the Government as a tribute to its efforts to ensure cheap food supplies, people went more freely to the poll than in the agricultural districts, which, generally speaking, gave expression to their dissatisfaction at the fixing of maximum prices and the introduction of export restrictions and other measures affecting their interests by voting for the Liberals.To judge from press comments, the Radical-cum-Socialist Government is quite firm in the saddle. Its foreign policy of strict neutrality meets with the approval of all Danes, and even among its political opponents there are not a few who consider that no other Government could have handled with greater, if as great, dexterity the many difficult problems which crossed its path.Possibly, more especially in view of the narrow Government majority (of two) in the &quot; Folketing &quot; (Lower House), some form of co-operation with the opposition parties may be arranged, but as yet there is no indication that any change will take place.A movement in Iceland, the scope and ultimate object of which is not yet quite clear, has latterly attracted a good deal of attention in the Scandinavian press. Olafur Fredriksson, editor of the Icelandic Socialist paper &quot; Dagsbrun,&quot; in an interview given to the independent Danish Socialist paper &quot; Dagens Ekko,&quot; made it quite clear that he was in Copenhagen to negotiate with the Danish Socialist leaders with reference to the constitutional relations of Iceland and Denmark. The flag question, he stated, was not a &apos;fit subject for negotiation. He significantly added that, unless Iceland were granted her own flag, the majority in the island favoured separation from Denmark, and that it was the first time in a hundred years that there was real danger of a rupture. &quot; Ieeland&apos;s wish is to take her place as an independent country among the United States of the North.&quot;It should be noted that Iceland has at present the use of her flag on her own territory and in her own territorial waters only, and that a request for its use without restrictions, put forward in November 1917, was refused by the King of Denmark, who, however, stated that there was no objection to negotiating with respect to conflicting points of view.The last Icelandic mails brought news of proceedings in the &quot;Alting&quot; (the Icelandic Parliament) which would seem to show that the temper of the Icelanders is such that, unless the Danes show a most conciliatory spirit, there is considerable danger of Iceland declaring its independence. In any case, it would appear that the flag claim is preliminary only to a further demand for a loosening of the bonds and personal i.e., under one king-union only with Denmark.Certain it is that on the 10th April the &quot; Alting &quot; met in extraordinary session and &quot; Sovereignty &quot; Committees were unanimously appointed, one of each Chamber, to consider and report as to the steps to be taken &quot; to secure control of our own affairs as soon as possible and obtain recognition of our sovereign rights.&quot; On the 19th April  these committees having been formed in the.meantime in each Chamber one speaker,. &apos;    [514-8] &apos;
in the name of all parties, declared that a clear &quot; Yes &quot; or &quot; No&quot; was required of Denmark, that negotiations with delegates of the King should be conducted at Reykjavik (the Icelandic capital), and that Parliament would not adjourn until a decision had been readied.The Danes seem alive to the danger. On the 14th and 15th May all the principal parties unanimously passed resolutions in favour of negotiations, the Liberals and Conservatives referring the question of their form and the place where they shall be conducted to the Rigsdag.It is to be anticipated that the Government will send delegates to Reykjavik. Whether the Icelanders will stand out for the granting of a general commercial flag preliminary to these negotiations or will allow the question to form part of them is not quite clear. It is true that the Socialist leader in Iceland, Fredriksson, insisted on the former, but there is so far no authoritative Icelandic support for his statement.With regard to Scandinavian economic co-operation which, in respect of exchange of goods during the war, is now being put into practice- it is worth noting, in connection with a scheme lately mooted, how economic matters can be affected by political considerations.The scheme in question is to supply Denmark with the water power, of which she has none, but of wdiich Norway has a huge surplus, and it is proposed to link up the Norwegian water power with the Swedish Trollhatten system and transfer it thence to Jutland by means of a special cable from Goteborg.The Danish paper &quot; Hovedstaden &quot; strongly opposes the scheme, principally on political grounds. It points out that its result, if successful, would be to make Denmark dependent on Swedish waterfalls instead of on British coal. The cutting off of the current would render Denmark helpless, whereas if the British coal supplies were stopped some would still be in the country, and foreign fuel could in any case be obtained. Also Denmark would become dependent on Sweden instead of England, and &quot; Iiovedstaden &quot; indicates that such a state of affairs would not be in Denmark&apos;s interests. There is a tendency, intentional or unintentional, behind &quot; Scandinavian co-operation,&quot; it continues, to squeeze out the trade and&apos; industry of the Western Powers and -thereby make us more dependent on. our southern neighbours. Let us, it concludes, develop our resources to the utmost. Only then shall we succeed in preserving our independence in all directions.It will be gathered from this extract that close and cordial co-operation between the Scandinavian countries is not easy of attainment. There are strong jealousies, and not much love lost between them, and any co-operative scheme which, impinges in the slightest degree on the political importance of any one country and might render it in any real sense dependent on another will be badly handicapped at the start.
FINLAND AND THE BALTIC PROVINCES.Within the past month, the Finnish question has grown into one of first-rate importance, mainly because of its bearing on tho fate of the Baltic and North Europe generally. If a Greater Finland becomes a vassal of Germany, not merely is Russia cut off from Western Europe along her north-western frontier, wherever that may eventually run, but the position of the other Scandinavian countries is threatened in a very direct way. German interest in Finland is not a matter of recent development. According to an article in &quot; Deutsche Politik,&quot; 15th March, 1918, Finnish exports to Germanv, consisting chiefly of timber, manufactured articles in wood, and butter, rose from 26,000,000 to 15,000,000 M. during the period 1910-13. On the other hand, German exports to Finland rose from 74,000,000 to 97,000,000 M. in the same period. Indeed, after Russia, Germany took the principal part in Finnish trade, and even passed Russia in the matter of direct exports to Finland.Of the total Finnish population of 3,250,000, only some 150,000 live in the towns, and over one-third of these are to be found in Lielsingfors. Accordingly any events that may come about in the capital can hardly be taken as representative of the state of feeling in the country, although just because Helsingfors is the one intellectual centre in Finland, it has hitherto tended to arrogate to itself the whole direction of affairs. In this way it becomes possible for a comparatively small group of individuals, supported by German troops, to carry through a series of changes about which there is as yet no unequivocal evidence that they commend themselves to the mass of the Finnish people. Chief amongst these recent changes have been the compulsory resignation of General Mannerheim, who was apparently too pro-Ally in his sympathies for the German taste, and a reconstruction of the Government, which makes it more completely pro-German than it was even before. The complete temporary ascendency of Germany is further evidenced by the warnings issued to some of the local papers that they would be suppressed if any article were published by them critical of the German occupation, and by the negotiations arranged by Germany on behalf of Finland with Russia, in virtue of which Finland cedes Ino and Raivolo -points close to the present frontier to Russia on the understanding that the latter does not fortify them, while Finland receives &quot;a strip of the Murman region with an outlet to the sea.&quot; The further statement that the German troops in Finland number 13,000, and the recent activity in the extension of the Finnish Northern Railway towards Pechenga, are sufficiently disquieting indications of plans for the German domination of this whole region. It is evident that through the furnishing of military assistance and the conducting of negotiations of territorial exchange, the Germans are attempting to induce a spirit of gratitude towards them on the part of the Finnish people, wishing to make them believe that in future their independence and political interests can be best safeguarded through a close political and economic union with Germany. The coping-stone in this structure of German supremacy is the intro-duction of a monarchical system.With regard to the state of feeling upon this particular question, reference may be made to an interview with the chief editor of the principal Young Finnish paper in Helsingiors, which was quoted in a Stockholm paper of 13th May. M. Erkko there maintains that whilst the leading Helsingfors organ of the Old Finnish party is monarchist in tone, most of the provincial papers of that party are republican, as are also the papers of the Agrarian party ; on the other hand, only a few of the provincial papers of the Swedish party stand for the monarchy. In Helsingfors, however, the Old Finnish and Swedish papers are extremely Monarchist. Nevertheless, M. Erkko maintains that, so far as he knows, an absolute majority of the Finnish people, with the exception of the inhabitants of Helsingfors, are opposed to the idea of a monarchy, so that with the inclusion of the Socialists it is certain that the republican form of government is secure unless in the event of a coup oVEtat. Out of the 200 members of the Finnish Diet 70 are proscribed for the moment as members of the Socialist party who took part in the recent civil war. Of the remaining 130, half, roughly, are Monarchists and the other half Republican. Accordingly, even in the present reduced Diet, the Monarchists cannot legally obtain the two-thirds majority which is necessary in connection with any change affecting the Finnish constitution; still less have they any chance of obtaining the further five-sixths majority which is required for making any immediate change, in default
of which the question would then become a leading one at the next general election. One result of the German manipulation of the present Government, which includes only three Republicans, is to drive the Young Finnish party and the Agrarians into closer co-operation with the moderate Socialists. The Young Finns have also stated that they are determined not to consent to the establishment of two Chambers, nor to agree to any restriction of the present universal suffrage. The result of the struggle is not yet known, but how determined is the movement for a monarchy in certain quarters may be judged from the recent pronouncement by the new Premier, Paasikivi, in which he urged that the Diet ought to listen to the views of the army, considering that it represents the will of the people, and that accordingly the Diet ought to establish a monarchy, since this form of government is necessary for a continuance of the present political relationships with. Germany. It is, however, pure assumption on his part to speak of the army as a whole as Monarchist, as no attempt has been made to find out its feeling upon this matter. The conclusion of his statement is that whilst many are afraid that the Finnish people will lose their independence as the result of too close relationship with Germany, they ought to remember that, as a matter of fact, there are very few States in the world that are really independent, the smaller nations being more or less compelled to come into close relations with the larger, and that for Finland the choice lay in this respect between Russia and Germany.The conditional offer of recognition of Finnish independence by His Majesty&apos;s Government has simp])7 served to show that no real independence exists to be recognised. At the same time, steps are being taken to turn to the best advantage the reaction against Germany, which can only be a matter of time.The latest news from the Baltic provinces indicates a growing feeling of resentment against the Germans on the part of the inhabitants of Esthonia, Courland,. and Livonia Gratifying reports have been received of the results of the recognition of the Esthonian National Council by His Majesty*s Government as a factor in stimulating the spirit of passive resistance amongst the Esthonians.June b, J9.18.
FRANCE.The three months which have passed since the last report was written have been months of tremendous events in France, but those events have, of course, been not political but military. At the present time no doubt the politics of all countries, even neutrals, are dominated or very greatly influenced by the changing phases of the military situation. But military events, however important, do not come within the purview of these reports except in this indirect way, that is, so far as they affect the political situation.Such attention as France has been able to spare from the German offensive has been mainly given to two things : the trial of the &quot; Bonnet Rouge &quot; gang and the affair of the Emperor Charles&apos; letter, by the publication of which M. Clemenceau caused so much excitement all over Europe.The &quot; Bonnet Rouge &quot; was a paper which even before the war was pro-German and anti-English, no doubt because it was very closely connected with M. Caillaux. The editor was one Almerejda (or Vigo), and its manager, of late at any rate, one Duval, who was also a frequent writer. These two individuals were arrested last August as a. result of a large German cheque having been found upon Duval as he was returning from Switzerland. Almereyda died in prison immediately in a rather mysterious fashion. Duval and other members of the gang survived to be found guilty of &quot;intelligence with the enemy,&quot; and Duval, who was shown to have received some 40,000L from a German banker named Marx, has been sentenced to death. The work he and the others had done for their wages was to carry on a campaign of &quot; defaitisnie &quot; or pacifism, especially at the front, where their articles were actually successful in-producing dangerous mutinies. Duval did not receive so much as Bolor but he did more to earn his money.The real interest of the trial does not lie in the crimes or the fate of these obscure traitors, but in their relations with Malvy and Caillaux. Both were often mentioned in the trial, and Caillaux appeared as a witness. Neither can gain by it. Malvy&apos;s own trial is approaching, and no one can tell what its result may be. But even if it establishes his innocence it can hardly restore his credit as a statesman. For after all he was the Minister of the Interior under whom all these strange proceedings went forward. It is his own private secretary, Leymarie, who stood in the dock with these adventurers, and was convicted with them, who gave passports to Duval in defiance of the Minister for War, who returned him his cheque after it had been seized, who took no steps to check the pacifist and lose-the-war campaign among the troops in spite of the urgent protests of General Nivelle and General Petain. For all this Malvy was either directly or indirectly responsible : as he is for having subsidised the &quot; Bonnet Rouge&quot; for a time (before it became very pacifist), and for having remained in close relations with Almereyda.All this can hardly fail to prove damaging to Malvy. So with Caillaux. It is true that he was not in office, and therefore gave no passports and returned no cheques. But he is shown, by his own confession, to have received a communication from the German Marx and not to have reported it to the Government. On the contrary, he merely turned Marx&apos;s emissary away, and kept the papers he had handed in, writing ou them &quot; Conversations refused.&quot; This is obviously a damaging incident. Moreover, the evidence showed him to have been in personal relations with four of the prisoners as well as with the dead Almereyda, whose paper he had subsidised at the time of Mme. Caillaux&apos;s trial for murder, in return for which Almereyda had not only championed that lady but had got together a body-guard of ruffians for her husband ! Now it is not a help to a politician accused of treason to have one friend convicted of the same crime ; but to have half-a-dozen !The whole trial, in fact, necessarily resulted in the further discredit of Caillaux and Malvy as the patrons and friends of the convicted traitors and the recipients of the support of the papers which are shown to have carried on their pacifist campaign with the help of German money. And their discredit is Clemenceaus strength. He may-need to be careful some writers, who are not his enemies, have hinted that Leymarie was rather too severely treated, and that the counsel for the prosecution was allowed too much laxity (&quot;Debats,&quot; 16th May; &quot;Yictoire,&quot; .1.6th May), but on the whole jjublic opinion rallies round the man who has shown himself determined to root out
the whole crop of traitors. And the offensive, especially at first, strengthened him Still further. The greater the danger the greater the need of the strongest man France has at her command. That is what the country as a whole feels him to be. Well-informed observers, both French and English, who have the best opportunities for judging, describe him as far the most popular public man there has been in France for many years. And Ids very opponents, like M. Llenonlt, the leader of the Socialist-Radicals, and M. Debierre, the president of the Coalition republioaine, a body practically founded to oppose him, have borne public testimony to his popularity both with the army and with the people. It is significant, too, that most of the &quot;conseils generaux,&quot; very important bodies representing the municipalities and communes of each department of France, passed votes of confidence in him at their recent meetings, and that many of these votes were unanimous. And his success in obtaining from the British Government the long-clesired concession as to unity of command was very popular both as flattering French vanity and as providing, in French opinion, much greater security for victory.This is probably still the position on the whole. But there is no doubt that the German offensive of last week and the rapid advance towards Paris were a rude shock to public opinion, and that some of the impatience inevitably felt at them was directed against Clemenceau. Probably if, as is hoped, the military position is soon stabilised, this will pass away. But it is certainly noteworthy that in the debate on the 4th June so many as 110 deputies voted against him on a vote of confidence. What they fancied they could put in his place at this time of crisis is not easy to imagine. Probably there would not have been so many of them if there had been any danger of his fall.Perhaps a good many of the minority were still anxious to make the protest they have never yet been given a chance of making against Clemenceau&apos;s action in the other matter alluded to at the beginning of this report, that of the publication of the letter of the Emperor Charles. There can be little or no cloubt that, whether written in collusion with Berlin or not, that letter could- not have led to peace. If it was sincere it was empty and futile, for nothing is more certain than that Germany would not surrender Alsace-Lorraine to please the Emperor Charles. And, sincere or not, it aimed at dividing France and Italy. The Emperor offered concessions about Alsace which was not his : he offered none about the Trentino. But because it was right of Ribot to reject the proposals in April 1917 it does not follow that it was right of Clemenceau to publish the Emperor&apos;s letter in March 19.18. He did it, no doubt, to reassure Italy against Czernin&apos;s suggestions that France was ready to betray her. But many people thought that there might come a time when it might be possible to play the Austrian Emperor against the Germans, and that therefore it was unwise to show him that he could not communicate with France with any assurance of secrecy. The matter has not yet been discussed in the Chamber. The Commission on Foreign Affairs, after hearing Clemenceau, Ribot, and Briand, decided by 14 to 5 that the various conversations opened up by the Austrians during 1917 and 1918 &quot; did not at any moment give opportunity for a peace acceptable to France and her Allies.&quot;The late Socialist Minister, Thomas, proposed an amendment, which was defeated-The party as a whole remains, as is shown by the division of the 4th June, in almost solid opposition to M. Clemenceau. But how long this will remain the case is not so certain. For during the last few weeks some forty of the Moderate Socialist deputies, not far from half the party, have formed themselves into an organised group, and taken the opportunity of the declarations made by M. Branting, the Swedish Socialist leader, and by the American Labour representatives who have lately visited England and France, to declare that they are in agreement with Branting and the Americans as to the impossibility of holding an international conference, and refuse to talk to the German Socialists until they have repudiated their military clique and broken its power. This action exasperated the Pacifist wing of the party and annoyed M. Thomas and his little Centre group, whose great anxiety is to preserve the party unity. But whether this will long be possible in view of the gulf of feeling which separates the &quot; Win-the-War &quot; section of the party, who are before all things Frenchmen, from the pacifist extremists, who are before all things Internationals, is, to say the least, extremely doubtful. The leader of the new group is Varenne, who was in the Ribot Ministry, and is believed to be willing to take office again.France has been freer from strikes than any country during the war. But there have been some serious ones lately arising out of the &quot; comb-out,&apos;&apos; out of a suspicion, put about probably by German agents, that the workmen sent to the army were to be replaced by Americans, and out of a certain feeling, fostered by the Minority Socialists,
that the Government might have had peace if it had used its opportunities. They were, however, settled fairly quietly after conferences between Clemenceau and the Socialist and Labour leaders. Their worst symptom, pehaps, was that a good many of the extreme men showed signs, such as have been seen in England, of defying the authority of their own leaders.France is undergoing the drastic experiment of three consecutive meatless days, and the regulations appear at last to be seriously enforced. The Minister has refused hitherto to introduce a system of meat coupons as in England ; the only check on consumption has been price, which of course acts unequally. He is now hoping to devise means to bring prices down. The Press spurs him on to fresh energy; and there have been admissions that in the whole matter of food France has been treated as the &quot; spoilt child &quot; of the Alliance, and that the luxurious meals of Paris have disgusted those fresh from the severe restrictions of New York and London.Still the first thought we have about France at this moment is certainly not criticism, but rather sympathy and admiration. Her ordeal is terrible, and on the whole she is facing it with the old &quot;courage never to submit or yield. And what is is else not to be overcome.&apos; And she has been especially warm of late in recognition of the services rendered by her Allies. There have been enthusiastic articles about the American soldiers, about the American naval and industrial effort, about the generosity of the American Red Cross work. Great tributes have been paid to the Canadian and Australian soldiers. And the other day Empire Day was made the occasion of meetings held all over France to do honour to Great Britain and the British dominions. That held at the Sorbonne for Paris was presided over by the President of the Chamber, who made the chief speech, and attended by the President of the Republic and the British Ambassador, who had a great reception. There was a very large and enthusiastic audience, as the President told the story of what the British Empire had done in the war. No doubt many of those present realised, what was generously said by one of the newspapers next day, that &quot; if England had had one hour of weakness in 1914 Europe might have become German.&quot;
GERMANY.The two most important events of the past month have been the renewal of the German offensive-this time from the Champagne front towards the Marne and Paris  and the laying of the basis of ,an extended A astro-German or Central European Alliance at the meeting of the Austrian and German Emperors at military headquarters.It has been suggested that the new military offensive represents a change in the immediate political objects of the German military leaders and the Supreme Command ; that their aim now is, by a military menace to Paris, in conjunction with air-raids and long-range bombardments, to break the spirit of the French and thus bring about the collapse of the Western Alliance before America can exert her full power. It is more probable that this scheme was always in the minds of those who conduct the campaign in the field and at the same time control the policy of the German Empire. The successful resistance which was encountered by the Somme and Flanders offensives in the preceding month has doubtless influenced the plan of the push towards the Marne and given it a more determined character. It has, after important initial successes, been manfully met by the French army and nation, so that, at the moment of writing, it appears to have received a check of the same kind as that which ultimately befel the offensives on the Somme and in Flanders. It remains to be seen whether everything will be staked upon the attempt to get within siege-gun range of Paris, or whether, the Germans having engaged what they may hope to be the bulk of the French reserves in the defence of the Marne front, a fresh blow will be struck elsewhere, again, perhaps with Amiens and Abbeville or the Channel Ports as its objective.The situation at the beginning of June is, in any case, not such as to relieve the great tension in Germany, ft leaves the German army with three great salients, on none of which has a decisive issue been brought into immediate prospect. The German losses have been very heavy, although, owing to the superior suddenness of the latest attack, not perhaps so heavy in this as in the two former advances. There is no sign that the general spirit of the population in Germany has been revived by events on the West, although the politicians seem to have resigned themselves to the view that the only road to a much-needed early peace is by victories of a decisive kind, such as the German military authorities, depreciating the influence of the internal collapse of Russia, claim to have achieved by force of arms in the East, but cannot, so far, produce on the West. This attitude is influenced by the failure of the so-called &quot;peace offensives &quot; of the spring, and particularly by the exposure of the Austrian EmperoFs overtures through Prince Sixtus of Bourbon.If there be any recent symptom of a renewal of unofficial overtures to record, it is to be found in the suggestion which comes from an organ of the Extreme Prussian party that Germany ought to state her terms, and very stiff ones too, in order that the Allies may know what awaits them if they continue the struggle. This suggestion is taken up by some of the newspapers which represent the few remaining advocates of what is called in Germany a &quot; reasonable peace :&apos; in order to press their views. But this restricted discussion is drowned by the sound of the cannon, and it does not alter the fact that for the moment everyone in Germany is awaiting the result of the present offensive and probably, in the case of more sensible people, the issue of the whole season&apos;s campaign.Evidence multiplies that it would be futile to base any expectations upon German Radical or Socialist objections to schemes of territorial annexation and economic coercion. Indeed, the Radicals and the Governmental Socialists relieve the Govern-ment of the task of defending or excusing the policy of a &quot; German peace.&quot; With regard to what has already been done in the East in the way of coercion, interference with the self-determination of nationalities and breaches of freshly-signed treaties, the excuse offered by so good a Radical as Wurttemberger, Konrad Haussmann, who has himself been frequently in Switzerland as a preacher of conciliation and compromise, is as follows : &quot; We [the Radicals] understand that the peace in the East, while the world-war continues to rage, compels Germany to reserve for herself greater possibilities of power and protection than would be necessary in the case of a general peace.&quot;
It is true that the speaker also called attention to the danger that Germany&apos;s proceedings in the East might render the Western Powers only more resolute in their determination to prosecute the war. He condemned the :i dynastic experiments&quot; which are being discussed for placing German Princes on thrones to be set up in the new eastern States ; and he feared that the policy of cutting off Russia from the Black Sea and the Baltic-there is also a new project to deprive her of her ice-free port on the Murman coast would not make the Slavs cease to cherish the permanent idea of regaining the place in the world which Germany is bent upon taking from them.In the wider sphere of world-politics, Germany has not renounced a single one of her ambitions, but lias, on the contrary, greatly enlarged their scope. Even Radical newspapers are elaborating vast schemes for obtaining control of Central Asia bv way of the Caucasus, Turkestan, Persia, and Afghanistan. Thus, the &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung &quot;* says : &quot;In order to establish a system of States, with a unified system of control and . ... in which an economic policy embracing the whole region from the Caucasus to Thibet, from Siberia to Afghanistan and to the Himalayas, is possible, there must either be such strong unifying factors that tendencies towards separa-tion can be overcome, or a new Power must intervene from outside.&quot;It is then gently insinuated that Islam alone can hardly supply the unifying element, since, apart from the differences between the Shiite and Sunnite sections of Mahommedanism, history shows that, &quot; where Islamic Empires arose, there were always other forces and conditions which had no immediate connection with Islam as a religion.&quot; The tendency of the article is to convey that Turkey in conjunction with Germany could possibly accomplish the task, and it concludes : &quot; The roads which lead from the Black Sea to the interior of Asia and thence to China will one day open up boundless territories and are destined to remake the economic map of the world. Let us hope that all concerned realise how to proceed in order to do justice to these mighty tasks.&quot;With regard to Africa the German Colonial Secretary in partibus, Dr. Solf, formerly Governor of Samoa, has equally grandiose plans. His idea is to consolidate the future German position there by obtaining in the &quot; German peace &quot; a dominion which, would extend from East Africa through the Belgian and the French Congo to the Atlantic coast, and which, in the opinion of the director of the German Togo Company, Herr Hupfeld, would be self-supporting, self-contained, and capable of self-defence on land and sea.f It appears to have been assumed that in exchange for this new African Empire Germany would be willing to abandon her claims to some of her former African colonies, particularly South-West Africa. That was a mistake, though, perhaps, in view of the chimerical nature of the whole project, an unimportant one, At a recent meeting of the Berlin section of the German Colonial Society Dr. Solf said that the Imperial Government could not entertain the idea of abandoning any former colony for the sake of &quot;consolidating its colonial possessions.&quot; Its demand continued to be &quot; the return.of all our colonies.&quot; This applied to &quot;German South-West Africa,&quot; and that &quot; equally on commercial, political, and national grounds.&quot;It also applied to the former German possessions in the South Seas. Dr. Solf &quot;most emphatically stated that Germany had no idea of abandoning the German possessions in the South Seas.&quot;:];An earlier German Colonial Secretary, Herr Dernburg, has enunciated an even wider scheme of world-policy than that of Dr. Solf. In an article in the Vienna &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; (19th May, No. 19,500) he says that neither the political and economic conquests of Germany, and the possibility of &quot;striking her suction-roots far into Asia,&quot; nor even the return of the German colonies and a good additional slice of Africa, could suffice for her and Austria-Hungary&apos;s economic needs.&quot; Freedom of the seas, therefore, and the supply of raw materials, must not only be demanded, but it must be possible, if necessary, to extort them by force,, and that from every quarter. So, too, with our exports to the raw material countries, since only this trade can provide the counter-values without which, large imports of raw materials are not feasible.&quot;* &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung,&quot; May 28, 1918, 1st morning edition, No. 146.t See &quot; Miincheiier Neueste Nachrichten,&quot; quoted in the &apos;*Times&quot; of April 30; 1918.\ &quot; Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,&quot; March 13, 1918 (No. 133, evening edition)i ;   /
Yet Herr Dernburg poses as a man of moderate views, an advocate of &quot; peace by understanding,&quot; and an. opponent of indemnities.The German Foreign Secretary, Herr von Kiihlrnann, illustrated what Herr Dernburg means when he recently (31st May) addressed the Berlin Chamber of Commerce on. the &quot; German peace &quot; with Roumania.   He said : &quot; Formal war indemnities were not demanded by Germany, but the numerous privileges we have secured are equivalent in the opinion of experts to anything which would have been yielded by war indemnities.&quot;With regard to the second great subject of the month, the proposed new alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary, it must.be borne in mind that at the meeting of the two Emperors at military headquarters there was only a general affirmation of the basis upon which their existing alliance was to be deepened, strengthened, and prolonged, and that details are reserved for negotiations between the statesmen and the economic authorities. All that is credibly reported in Germany about the result of the preliminary exchange of views is (1) that the new treaty will be valid without renewal for a much longer period, than the old one, which was renewable every six years. It is said that it may be concluded for as long as twenty-five years. (2) Russia is no longer regarded as formidable, and, therefore, the new treaty, instead of being solely directed against Russia, will be concerned with all that &quot; world of enemies &quot; which the great war has ranged against the Central Powers. It will be designed to confront the menace of a future coalition from whatever quarter it may come. (3) With a view to maintaining the military efficiency of the Alliance in peace time, the arrange-ments for facilitating transport and food supplies and for co-ordinating the mobilisation and the munitioning of the allied armies will be assimilated to those which have been carried out during the wTar. These arrangements will be on the basis of complete parity of the two Powers. The supreme commands in the hands of the respective monarchs will remain, as before, independent, yet it is contemplated that in the event of another war the armies of the two Empires shall from the first act like one body. (4) The Alliance, which is described as having hitherto been concerned only with the case of war, is to be converted into a permanent community of interests in the economic sphere.A certain amount of anxiety has been manifested, chiefly in Austria-Hungary, and particularly among the Magyars, with regard to the proposed assimilation of the two armies. The Hungarian Minister-President, M. Wekerle, has assured critics that while, as in war time, agreements might deal with common action and armament, they would not trench upon the organisation of the army. They in Hungary would maintain their rights of disposition (&quot; Verfugungsrechte &quot;) in every regard.The German Chancellor, Count Hertling, who was present at the Imperial meeting, has stated in a newspaper interview that the two parties to the Alliance only wanted to consolidate the existing situation, and desired after the peace to remain closely allied, as the war had drawn them nearer. The military leaders, Hindenburg, Ludendorff, and the Austrian General von Arz, who were also present, were reported by Hertling to be entirely satisfied. Dealing with the external aspects of the future Alliance, Hertling denied that it need in any way interfere with the prospects of an eventual &quot; League of Nations,&quot; or that in the economic sphere it could afford any justification for the &quot; war after the war &quot; which was contemplated in Entente quarters. &quot; We only desire,&quot; he said, &quot; to make the most of the possibilities which our union implies  nothing more.&quot; The discussion of political and economic schemes, complementary to the closer union of Central Europe, of which some account has been given in the first part of this report, may suffice to show how official or representative Germans contemplate &quot; making the most of the possibilities &quot; which the closer union of Central Europe is believed by them to secure.
GREECE.IN a previous report, dated the 11th March, attention Avas drawn to the way in which the chances of M. Venizelos reuniting the Greek nation and making it once again a factor of some international importance depended primarily on the satisfaction oE the immediate material and moral needs of the people. During the first few months after his return to power in June last year M. Venizelos was naturally occupied with the task of safeguarding the position of the new regime by taking adequate security against the agents of King Constantine and his political supporters and their followers in the country. That task is not yet completed, and in the course of this report the difficulties which the new regime meets with from the adherents of the old and the way in which these difficulties are met will be discussed.Not entirely divorced from this question, in fact closely connected with it, another practical question of perhaps greater, urgency was that of restoring the internal prosperity of the country and its international prestige. The first and most difficult problem M. Venizelos had to face was the practical bankruptcy of Greek finance and the ever-increasing shortage of food supplies in the country. Unless these two urgent needs could be satisfactorily met, it was idle to hope that the population as a whole could he convinced of the advantage oE the change of regime or persuaded of the desirability or even the possibility of entering whole-heartedly on the war with the prospect of procuring any advantage either for Greece or for the Allies of Greece. The solution of. this problem depended partly on the reform of the internal administra-tion of the country, but still more on the willingness of the Entente Powers to extend their favour and support to a Greece which could show itself both faithful and useful to them. The order of procedure in the case of the Venizelist policy has therefore been in the main: (1) Sweeping reforms of the administration and preparation for constitutional changes ; (2) increased co-operation with the Entente Powers on the basis of the promise of an adequate Greek army for the Macedonian front as soon as the economic and financial difficulties of the country could be adjusted ; (3) the slow but never slackening preparation of this army for the task of clearing Eastern Macedonia of the invader and co-operating with the Entente forces in the Balkan theatre of war. The way in which M. Venizelos has attempted to deal with these three questions and the measure of ihis success may be briefly estimated.1. On his return to power last June M. Venizelos at once reassembled the Chamber elected on ithe-13th June, 1915, which had been, as he contended, illegally dissolved by King Constantine in the autumn of that year.   In the Kings Speech from . the Throne on the occasion of the reassembly of the Chamber (1st August), an allusion was made to the fact that, as a revision of the ^Constitution was necessary to provide against :any such infringements of the spirit of it as had been committed by the late King, a Revisionist Assembly would -shortly be called -together to make these changes. Nothing has been done, liowever, in the past &apos;ten months in this direction.  ;More pressing affairs have postponed ;the constitutional issue, and it is probably idle to expect such a revisionist body to be assembled before the end of this year, if so soon. Practical steps, however, were at once taken to deal with the ringleaders of the auto-cratic party who had flouted the .will of the.Greek people.   Many of these were at once expelled from the ,country and interned iin iCorsica -and -elsewhere, while others, including the majority of the members of the Skouloudhis and-Lambros Governments, were brought for trial before especially appointed Parliamentary Commissions, which passed severe sentences on their actions.   That even so the power to intrigue against the new regime was not wholly-taken away from its opponents has been within the last few months strikingly shown.by.the February mutinies referred to:in the report of the 11th March,as a result of which several anti-Venizelist politicians and their.wives were expelled from the country or interned in monasteries.   Early in March-soon after this -a new ; attempt was made by the adherents of-the ex-King, who continues his propaganda in Switzerland in connection with the; Central Powers.   Two officers were sent by him on board, a German submarine to the -Peloponnese with the object of spreading, sedition in -that -part of -the country, -and ultimately amongst the army. Fortunately-they were detected ,and sentenced.to.death,sthough;the sentence has not yet been carried ,out.    As it has proved impossible *to- control ithe .aetivities of &apos;King Constantine [in a neutral countrv ilike .Switzerland, ^the/Greek Government cannot [51.4-.5]
ensure itself against a repetition of these intrigues. As an effective protest the Chamber almost unanimously voted to discontinue the subsidies to the ex-King for which they had made themselves responsible at the time of his abdication.All possible control is exercised on the activity of anti-Venizelist agents, hut the Government has, perhaps wisely, not pushed its police measures too far, and has preferred to rely on &quot;the rival patriotic propaganda carried on by its followers throughout the Peloponnese in the hope of gradually winning this most Constantinian portion of the country to the idea of whole-hearted co-operation in the war. On the other hand, a considerable section of Central Greece is still under martial law, and at Athens, both the press and the debates in the Chamber are subjected to the severest censorship to an extent which is resented even by extremely Venizelist papers. The small Opposition in the Chamber, led by M. Stratos, has therefore few opportunities of making its somewhat ineffective voice heard ; but it seems doubtful if the Government is not, in its dread of a movement whose importance it perhaps exaggerates, making more enemies than it can afford to.The purge of the political and civil administration which has been referred to has been continued. The Civil Service, the Judiciary, and the Episcopate have been ruth-lessly overhauled, and positions of importance confided to persons in whom the Government has confidence. Perhaps the appointment of most importance was that of the late Bishop of Kition in Cyprus, Meletios, to take the place of the ex-Metropolitan Theoklitos, on whom a sentence of deprivation, and internment in a monastery was passed for his political intrigues on behalf of King Constantine, which culminated in the anathema ceremony of Christmas 1916. The new Metropolitan is, for an Orthodox Bishop, a revolutionary. He has proposed sweeping changes in the monastic system, and even the canon-law. A strong adherent both of National and Church rapproche-ment with England, he is at the same time an enthusiastic Hellenist. His recent visit to the Macedonian front was considered to have had an excellent influence on the moral of the people as a whole.Progress continues to be made with the settlement of the food difficulties in which the country had increasingly found itself owing to the shortage of transport and the blockade exercised by the Entente Powers against the country under the old regime. Ministers of Supplies, Revictualling, and Pensions form part of the Cabinet side by side with the Minister of Finance. They have exposed, and to a large extent corrected, the abuses of the old regime under which Royalist political opinions were accounted reason for preferential treatment, but, in their turn, the entourage of the new food dictators have been subjected to the same criticisms as the old, and it has taken all the force and tact of M. Venizeloss character, and the help of the best circles surrounding him, to secure an honest and capable administration of the new measures. Fortunately, M.&apos; Venizelos has been able to count on the whole-hearted support of the Entente Powers so far as circumstances have allowed of this.The food question, while still a serious one for Greece, is now being dealt with on just and sensible lines. All commodities of primary necessity are rationed, and State purchase and the ticket system of distribution have served to equalise the burden under which the whole population suffered. Prices are high and food supplies not over-abundant, but on the whole they are evenly and adequately distributed. Meat is, of course, very short, and bread is much dearer and inferior to the normal. But on the whole the population has now enough, and if things continue as at present the food question should prove no obstacle to the mobilisation of the country for war and the maintenance of the army in the field.2. M. Venizelos, through his visit to France and England at the end of last year, and in the last few days his colleague, M. Mikhalakopoulos, Minister of Agriculture, have had the advantage of personal conferences with the British and French authorities. They have expressed themselves as fully satisfied with the response to Greece&apos;s request for financial and economic assistance made to the Western Powers. The financial needs of the country are, indeed, being met in part by an internal loan of 100,000,000 drachmas (4,000,0.00?.) at 6 per cent., the success of which loan is not, however, yet assured. But Greece must necessarily depend on international assistance to re-establish her much shattered finance. In April M. Negropondis, Minister of Finance, was able to submit to the Chamber a financial:agreement concluded with the British, French, and American Governments, which assures Greece of the advance of all sums needed to mobilise her army and resources for the Macedonian campaign up to 750,000,000 fr. The details of the. agreement did not altogether satisfy its Greek critics, who would have liked a freer hand in dealing with the moneys put at the disposal of the Greek Government, and in some cases were inclined to demanc). as
a free gift what is being allowed them as a loan for a certain definite purpose. On the whole it may be said, however, that Greek opinion is satisfied with the success of the Venizelist Government in securing once again the financial support of the Western Powers, which its predecessor had forfeited and without which Greece cannot live.,3. The reason for the loan, alike on the part of the Entente Governments, and of the Greek Government who demanded it, was of course the need for a speedy and full mobilisation of the forces of the country for operations on the Macedonian front. This mobilisation has been proceeded with cautiously, especially in disaffected districts, but continuously. The younger and more adaptable classes were called up at first, and the reservists, whose loyalty to the patriotic cause had been severely infected by anti-Venizelist intrigues, have been for the time being left aside. This policy has probably justified itself. Early in April the new army, brigaded like its comrades the Venizelist volunteers with British troops on the Struma front, had its first taste of military success. A minor but well-conceived advance enabled them to recover ten villages on the left bank of the Struma which had been evacuated for sanitary reasons by the British troops some months before. The enthusiasm aroused in the Greek press by this success will be intensified by the events of the last few days. On the 30th May Greek troops, supported by French artillery, attacked the strong Bulgar positions facing them, penetrated them to the depth of a mile, and took some 1,800 prisoners. The words of the French Commander-in-chief that &quot; this success must fill the whole of Greece with legitimate pride and still greater ardour for work in combat&quot; have been justified by the response from Greek opinion. No better method could have been found for inspiring patriotic feeling in the country, and it will go far to annul the impression of disquiet caused by the German successes on the Western Front. Possibly it was this success which enabled the Government two days later to announce that it had decided on the registration and mobilisation of all labour, male and female, in the country for meeting the national need. If M. Venizelos has proceeded slowly in his difficult task, he can probably maintain with justice that it-was the surest method of accomplishing it .
ITALY.Military Affairs.THE Austrian offensive is still delayed and press speculation on the subject continues. Early in May the Geneva correspondent of. &quot; L&apos;Epoca &quot; asserted in a telegram that Berlin was of opinion that, since the war was to be decided in France, a successful diversion by invading Italy would merely prolong hostilities and was pressing Vienna &quot; to give up Milan in order to save Paris.&quot; This message, widely reproduced in the Italian press, was perhaps intended by &quot; L&apos;Epoca &quot; (which is in close touch with Signor Orlando) to relieve any anxiety that might have been created by the announcement made by the President of Council regarding the despatch of Italian troops to France.Support was fonnd for the view in the objection raised in various Austrian journals to the proposal to send Austrian troops to the West.Presently, however, the press returned to its belief in the imminence of1 an offensive, and was confirmed therein by the meeting of the two Emperors at German G.H.Q. and; the French opinion.that at,this meeting an.offensive against Italy had been definitely, decided upon. The withdrawal, of Austrian artillery from the Western front is. noted as symptomatic,Two successes of importance have meanwhile been, obtained by the Italian arms. The summit of Monte Corno (a north-westerly bastion of Monte Pasubio),was brilliantly stormed on the night of the 9th-10th May. This recovery has special value, as: it was. on Monte Corno that the Austrians captured Battisti, the martyr, of: Irredentism. On the 25th May (as if to celebrate the anniversary of Italy&apos;s declaration of war) an even more brilliant feat was performed by the Alpini in the capture of the Pass of Monticello and several commanding heights in the vicinity, along with some 900 prisoners and a considerable number of guns. The Pass of Mbnticello lies a little south of the Tonale Pass, on the western frontier of the Trentiho.Italy and Austria-Hwigary. ......The Latin-Slav pact and the presence of Czecho-Slovak troops on the Italian front seems to have already produced tangible results. Not only is the attitude assumed by tlie- Ozecho-Slovaks and Jugo-Slavs towards the Viennese Government more uncom-promising than ever, the: agitation more intense, and&apos;unity of action more pronounced, but there is evidence from Austrian sources of fresh mutinying of Czech regiments-on the AustrianJtalian&apos;front.Dr. von Seidler&apos;s announcement of the adjournment of the Austrian Reichsrat, and His-speech to the party-leaders on the 3rd May called forth a joint protest from the Czecho-Slovak Union and the Jugo-Slav Club, and contributed to the recrudescence of the &quot;nationalities &quot; agitation: The action foreshadowed in that speech a division of Bohemia for administrative^ purposes into circles according to nationality, definitely announced, and the creation, hinted at, of a-Jugo-Slav state, within the monarchy, but not including &quot; those parts of Austrian territory which, lying on the way to the Adriatic, were closely connected with, districts where the German language was spoken &quot;-taken in connection with the Austrian solution of the Polish question (supposed to have been determined upon at the meeting of the Emperors), is interpreted in Italy as an attempt to isolate and render powerless the Czechs, whose movement is the most formidable.The delegates who attended the Rome Congress of the 6th-10th April were officially received by M. Clemencean on the 4th May, and recently a declaration by Mr. Lansing reported in the &quot;Times&quot; of the 31st May is interpreted as indicating approval on the part of .the.U.niteji.States.Govermnent.of Czecho-Slovak and Jugo-Slav national aspirations.The Prince of Wales in Home.On the 24th May, the anniversary of Italy&apos;s entry into the war, Avas celebrated at Rome and throughout Italy. The celebration at Rome acquired special importance and significance from the presence of the Prince of Wales, who was received with marked and almost affectionate enthusiasm.
Changes in the Cabinet.The grave irregularities in the Munitions Department revealed during the April Session of Parliament have led to the resignation of General Dallolio officially explained as due to his desire to leave the Government unhampered by any personal considerations in undertaking the promised reorganisation of the business side of the Department.The resignation of Signor Bianchi, Minister of Transports, tendered some time back, has also been accepted.   He is replaced by Signor Villa.General Rupelli, Minister of War takes charge, ad interim, of the Ministry of Arms and Munitions.The censorship has not permitted the real reasons underlying these changes to be revealed. &quot; LVEpoca,&quot; however, whose editor is a friend of Signor Orlando, hints that they are connected with a movement for diminishing the military element in the Government.The &quot; Commissariato &quot; of Food and Provisioning has been raised to the rank of a Ministry.   Signor Crespi remains in control.Socialist Parties.The action of the Parliamentary group of the official (or Marxist) Socialists during the April Session, in co-operating with Giolittians of the Parliamentary Union, has led to a further widening of the breach between that section of the party, which is anxious to reconcile its Marxist principles with recognition of national duties and of collaboration with bourgeois parties, and the uncompromising Executive Committee.On the 12th, 13th, and 14th May the Italian Socialist Union-of Reformist and other pro-war Socialists and Syndicalists held its first formal Congress in Rome. Speeches were delivered by the Ministers Bissolati and Berenini.The Vatican.Charged by certain British journals with having inspired or encouraged the action of the Irish bishops in opposing conscription in that country, the Vatican.has declared through its organs that it has no responsibility in the matter, the Irish bishops being entirely independent in regard to political activity. This statement is confirmed by the Irish bishops themselves.Exchange of Prisoners.According to German wireless of the 24th May, a German-Italian Agreement regarding the exchange of prisoners of war and civilians was signed at Berne on the 15th May. According to this agreement the seriously wounded or seriously ill war prisoners, as well as the hospital stalls, will, on a mutual basis, be repatriated immediately. Furthermore, men of over 45 years of age who have large families, and a number of prisoners who have been in prison over eighteen months will be exchanged. Sir R. Rodd reports that the German delegates refused to negotiate unless the repatriation of fit men was discussed. Ultimately it was arranged that they should be exchanged, man for man, in corresponding ranks, in the case of prisoners upwards of 45 years of age, or between 40 and 45, if fathers of at least three children.
: THE JUGOSLAV MOVEMENT.The declaration by the Conference of the British, French, and Italian Prime Ministers at Versailles on the 3rd June that &quot; the Allied Governments have noted with pleasure the declaration made by the Secretary of State for the United States Government and desire to associate themselves in an expression of earnest sympathy for the nationalistic aspirations towards freedom of the Czecho-Slovak and Jugoslav peoples &apos;&apos; stamps with an official character the attitude of the Entente Powers towards a movement which has been more and more demanding inter-national recognition.   In its present political distribution, the Jugoslav, or Southern Slav, nation in its three branches (the Slovenes, the Croats, and the Serbs) is subjected to various political regimes.   Before the war there were the two free kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro, comprising altogether between three and four millions; the rest of the Jugoslavs were subject to the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary.   Partly owing to accidents of history, partly to astute political arrange-ments, these Austro-Hungarian Jugoslavs were prevented from forming any sort of political unit under the Hapsburg Crown.    Almost all the Slovenes, whose territory roughly extends from. East of Marburg in Styria down to Trieste and again from Villach South to Zagrab (Agram) with its chief centre at Ljubljana (Laibach), were divided between the two Austrian provinces of Styria and Carniola.   The Croats, of the same race and language as the Serbs, though of a different faith, were partly situated in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, which since 1102 had by its own free choice been joined by a personal union to the Hungarian Crown, and which, by the Compromise with Hungary of 1868, had on definite terms made only to be set aside or overridden found its place in the Hungarian half of the Dual Monarchy.   Further, two-thirds of the Austrian province of Istria, and again practically the whole of Dalmatia (formerly part of the Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, Dalmatia) were inhabited by the Croats, who, again, form a, considerable portion of the purely Serbo-Croatian country of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serbs again, i.e., Jugoslavs of Orthodox Faith, are to be found in considerable numbers in the provinces of the Banat and Bachka directly under the Hungarian Crown, and throughout the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, conquered by the Turks in the 15th century, occupied by Austria-Hungary under the Treaty of Berlin (1878), annexed in 1908, and since then ruled as a joint possession of Austria and Hungary.It has been the policy both of Vienna and Budapest to prevent the political union of these various sections of the Jugoslav race which might have made them powerful enough to upset the balance of Dualism. The Jugoslavs, as we have seen, are partitioned amongst various Austrian and Hungarian political divisions, and part of them again, those of Bosnia, are jointly ruled by Austria and Hungary. The Hapsburg policy of &quot;divide and rule&quot; has never been so clearly exemplified as in the case of the Jugoslavs. The late Archduke Francis Ferdinand, conscious of the wedge that was being driven through ancient Croat loyalty to the Hapsburg throne by the sinister fashion in which the Hungarian Government had repeatedly violated all its pledges of 1868, and introduced a regime of tyranny into Croatia, was anxious to hold out to the Jugoslavs a promise of some such &quot; Trialistic solution as would enable them to play a free and important part in a reformed Hapsburg Empire. Whether he really had these intentions, and whether, if so, he could ever have overcome the irreconcilable hostility of the powerful ruling classes in Hungary to such a plan, his assassination at Sarajevo has prevented history from determining surely. From the 28th June, 1914, the Jugoslav movement necessarily entered on a new phase.It is impossible in a short Report to give any full account of the formation jf the various political parties among the Jugoslavs since 1868, but this may be said: that for fully forty years they have all been parties of opposition to the prevailing regime. But this spirit of opposition has taken the form in some of direct opposition to Budapest, looking for support to the Hapsburg Crown and Vienna; amongst others of an attempt to secure in alliance with the Magyars such a hold over Vienna as to make Vienna both itself grant, and force Budapest to grant, a fairer solution of the national question. A crisis was reached in 1905. Until that date the quarrels between parties and religions in the Jugoslav countries, intensified bv the skill of Vienna and Budapest, had prevented the formation of any real united Jugoslav movement. But the impossible position to which Croatia had been reduced by the persistently reactionary Government of the Hungarians and the
continued neglect of the question by the politicians of Vienna, forced in 1905 on the Serb and Croat leaders the decision to unite in the common interests of both. The Resolution of Fiurrie on the 4th October, 1905, with its appeal to the now famous doctrine of self-determination, is an historic document for the whole Jugo-slav nation. Its implication that race is a bond above that of religion or political convenience is now explicitly acknowledged by almost all the thinking elements among the Jugoslavs. Into the immediate policy initiated by the founders of the movement it is impossible here to enter. Their attempted rapprochement with the leaders of the Independence Party in Hungary within eighteen months broke down owing to the bad faith of the Magyar leaders. Since then there has been practically a truceless war between Hungary and the Jugoslavs. The victories of Serbia in the two Balkan Wars for the first time roused in the Jugoslavs of Austria-Hungary the hope that it was to Serbia they could look as the nucleus for a future independent State.   Serbia, it was said, would become the Piedmont of Jugoslavia.The European war brought matters to a crisis. Had it from the first been clear to the Jugoslav peoples that it was to the Entente Powers they could surely look for the vindication of their liberties; had they in turn made it clear to the Entente Powers that their fixed and united resolve was to obtain these liberties, things might have gone differently. As it was, from tradition or as the course of least resistance, the Jugoslavs of Austria, without abandoning their national aspirations, felt there was no choice but to carry out their apparent duty as subjects of the Hapsburgs. They deserted indeed in thousands to their brother Slavs, the Russians, and the Serbians, but elsewhere they have fought with courage and determination, especially against Italy, a nation with which, owing to mutual misunderstandings and injuries, they have for centuries on the Adriatic coast lived in bitter feud. The terms of the treaty by which Italy intervened in the war and by which she obtained a large portion of Dalmatia where over 90 per cent, of the population is Croat, were at once known and bitterly resented among the Jugoslavs. The result was seen in the enthusiasm with which they threw themselves into war against Italy. The result on the other side was to convince the Italians that the Croats were their bitter foes, the tools of Vienna, with whom there could be no compromise. It has taken more than two years for both sides to learn better.From the first, however, apart from France and England, where the legitimate hopes of both Italians and Jugoslavs were sympathetically, if critically, viewed, there were even among the Italians and Jugoslavs small circles which cordially desired a rapprochement between two peoples who shared a common enemy, the Central Empires, and a common hope, national union and freedom. During 1917 the small circle of Radicals in Italy, who have always maintained this point of view, began slowly but surely to find wider support among the nation as a whole. The turning point perhaps was reached when the &quot; Corriere della Sera,&quot; of Milan, the most important Italian daily, made its voice heard in favour of an Italo-Jugoslav under-standing. The long duration of the war, the Russian Revolution, and the more impartial study of fundamental facts gradually convinced the Italian public that this policy was, in fact, the only just and wise one. The Orlando Government was from the first anxious to extend a hand of friendship to the Jugoslavs. Early this year a definite step was taken. Signer Torre, an Italian Senator representing a large section of opinion in both Italian Houses of Parliament came to London, and there with Dr. Trumbic, President of the Southern Slav Committee representing practically all the Jugoslavs who were able to make their voice heard, a fundamental basis of agreement was reached providing for co-operation against Austria-Hungary and for an amicable solution of the questions pending between the two peoples. On the basis of this agreement there was held in April, at Rome, a Congress of all the oppressed nationalities of Austria-Hungary. Its proceedings were successful beyond all anticipation. Italo-Jugoslav solidarity was strongly affirmed, and on the basis of it was formed a league of the representatives abroad of all the oppressed Austro-Hungarian, nationalities with a common programme of self-determination and national union for all these peoples. This declaration is, in tfact, the starting point for Entente policy towards the Austro-Hungarian question, and  or the,development of .the national Movements,themselves in Austria-Hungary., &quot;Vfe^rnay now turn to thejugosjav side of .the question.., Old suspicions die hard, ajjja ^itvWp difficult to join together peoples and parties whom the Hapsburgs had niacle;^ their jnissiob ,ip ^eep. asunaer.,., As f we. have seen, the intransigeancevof Magyar policy on the one sicte and ffie growing enthusiasm for Serbia on the other roused by her victories in the Balkan wars, and her gallant resistance to&apos; Austria in
1914, had a powerful effect in determining the orientation of the Jugoslav peoples of Austria-Hungary. Three years of war, which have brought Austria-Hungary into ever-closer relation with and imitation of Pan-German policy, showed more and more the hopelessness of any compromise. The Reichsrat, which after three years was at length reassembled in the summer of 1917, found itself confronted with a new party, the Jugoslav Club, comprising all the Slovene and Croat parties in Austria. On the 30th May, the club, like its twin sister the Czech Club, put forth a demand for the full right of self-determination under the Hapsburg Crown. Still more important events took place abroad. On the 20th July, Dr. Trumbic, President of the Southern Slav Committee, signed at Corfu, with Mr. Pasic, the Serbian Prime Minister, a pact by which both sides acknowledged their common ideals and common destiny. A future Jugoslav State comprising the three peoples, Slovenes, Croatians, and Serbs, in completely free and equal union under the present Serbian dynasty, was proclaimed as the goal of all Jugoslav effort. The effect of this in Austria-Hungary has been far-reaching. Still more far-reaching was that of the April Rome Congress just referred to. What had been once a vague aspiration has become a practicable ideal for the Jugoslavs of Austria. The events of the last few weeks have shown the growing strength of this movement. Invited to Prague on the 13th April, the Jugo-slav deputation of 25 members announced that it took its stand with the Czecho-Slovaks in demanding &quot; a free and independent life, a free and unfettered develop1-ment of our existence.&quot; &quot;We will endure,&quot; they said, &quot;until we establish the independence of our people.&quot; The reply of the Austrian Government was to hint at the possibility of a piecemeal solution of the Jugoslav question. It is proposed that Dalmatia be joined to Croatia and Slavonia under the strict control of the Hungarian Crown, and to this State again Bosnia may be thrown as a sop. But such a so-called Jugoslav State would, in fact, under Hungarian control, as all the Jugoslav people knows, possess a mere shadow of freedom. Moreover, even such a limited union could only be obtained by the sacrifice to Austria of all the Northern Croats and Slovenes who stand in the way of the Austro-German march to the Adriatic, and therefore must be Germanised or crushed. There was no question of the Jugoslavs jumping at such a bait; on the contrary, from that moment the rift between Jugoslavs and Austria-Hungary has become an unbridgeable chasm.On the 16th May once again a great demonstration took place in Prague, and an important Jugoslav delegation announced once more their whole-hearted alliance with the Czechs in their determination to secure the full freedom of both peoples. In the report of their united meeting at which Polish and Italian delegates were also present, occur the words: &quot;We have unanimously agreed to do everything in our power to obtain after this terrible war liberty for our respective nations and a new free life on the basis of the right of self-determination. We are one in our conviction that a better future for our peoples can only be assured on the firm foundation of universal democracy and a true and sovereign government by the people within the nations, and by the establishment of a League of Nations endowed with authoritative power.&quot; This declaration of the 17th May will form the basis of all future Jugoslav efforts. There is no longer any talk nowadays of self-determination under the Hapsburgs, which alone the Jugoslav and Czech Clubs on the 30th May, 1917, ventured to demand. Full self-determination is what is demanded. The immediate development of the movement may depend in part on military events in Western Europe. It may, on the other hand, precede and affect these events. In any case, the Jugoslav movement has become a factor of permanent international importance. In a practical fashion the co-operation of the Jugoslav peoples with the Entente Powers is being shown by the gallant behaviour on the Salonica front as two years ago in Roumania of the many thousands of Jugoslav volunteers who deserted from the Austrian armies in order to take their part on the right side in the struggle for freedom.
THE NETHERLANDS.Food and neutrality have been uppermost in the minds of the Dutch people during the last month, and have formed the chief preoccupations of the Government and press. These two subjects have, indeed, directly or indirectly, been the main theme of all discussions for many months past, since on the supply of one and the maintenance of the other depend the principal negotiations of the Netherlands with the belligerent Governments.The general shortage of foodstuffs (except sugar) of almost every description, including produce grown in the country of which there is a surfeit in normal times, has led to the imposition of drastic restrictions, and the existence Of not a little hardship. Although such a state of affairs is common to almost all European countries, it should, not be forgotten that in the Netherlands there is no compensating stimulus of patriotic self-sacrifice such as exists among the belligerent peoples. Considerable criticism has been directed from all sides against the Government, who are accused of having failed in their negotiations with the several warring countries to secure either an adequate supply of bare necessities or the sufficient limitation of export of produce exchanged for material required for the country&apos;s industries. The fact that coal is obtained from Germany at excessive cost, both in money and home products, has given rise to more than one pertinent enquiry as to why that commodity has not been procured from the United Kingdom, despite the German restrictions on Dutch shipping. It would be incorrect to interpret these criticisms as condemnation of the Governments policy, and they are the outcome of petulance rather than of hostility. The people of the Netherlands have grown to depenol upon the Govern-ment to find for them a way out of their difficulties, and although no nation is more prone than the Dutch to discuss and enquire into the why and wherefore of matters - affecthn^ it, the general attitude has long been to support the Government almost blindly, and trust to their solution of the problems with which the country is beset.The position of Holland is unenviable in the highest degree, as it is evident to both belligerents that her policy is to maintain neutrality at almost any cost, and this knowledge causes them in turn to enforce measures from which they themselves derive direct or indirect benefit. Correspondingly the method of the Dutch Government is to obtain such advantage as may be possible from pitting the necessities and desires of one belligerent against those of the other wherever Holland is concerned.Among the restrictions receiving most attention during the period under review are the requisition by the Allies of a large portion of Dutch shipping, and the application of new German Prize Laws to vessels under the Netherlands&apos; flag sailing to and from Dutch ports. The former measure, legitimate if harsh, was justified by the necessity of preventing available tonnage from languishing in port, owing to the Dutch fear of the German submarine menace. The latter was a direct, if not an admitted, German reprisal, aimed at preventing further Dutch tonnage from becoming directly or indirectly available for the uses of the Associated Governments. It appears probable that in the near future an arrangement will be reached between the Netherland and German Governments, by which Dutch vessels will be permitted to sail from Dutch ports simultaneously with the release of corresponding vessels destined for Holland from Allied ports.The battledore and shuttlecock process with Holland as the victim, seems destined to proceed until such time as the Netherlands have no more to give in either direction, and, although neither belligerent probably has the desire or intention to drive the country to extremes through exasperation, it cannot be denied1 that the repeated application of the screw first from one side and then from the other must corrupt the national mentality and increase the feeling of impotence from which Holland is suffering. The recent expression of opinion of a Dutchman, of anything but bellicose views, that &quot;too much neutrality is a bad thing,&quot; probably represents the innermost feelings of a considerable section of the population of Holland.The above remarks may serve to explain the reason for the difficulty of presenting the Allied cause in Holland in a manner calculated to meet with popular response. In actual fact there is little doubt that a. much greater pro-portion of the population sympathises with the Allies than with our enemies, and that there is very general and vigorous animosity, tempered by fear, for Germany. At the same time it is difficult to expect that a critical nation will accept our own appreciation of ourselves and of our cause at its face value when confronted with
what can only be considered, from the Dutch point of view, as repeated affronts to the national dignity and welfare. This state of affairs no doubt accounts for the numerous bitter and sarcastic comments of the Dutch press in regard to this country, as, for instance, a recent article in the &quot; Handelsblad &quot; in relation to a British Prize Court decision in respect of the Dutch ship &quot;Leonora, &apos; which remarks that &quot; even when the conditions of belligerent Governments are faithfully observed there is no guarantee that vessels will not be seized and confiscated on the ground that these conditions are contrary to international law.&quot; The same article adds that &quot; from the attitude of the Prize Court it follows that no reliance can be placed on any single declaration, concession, or permission of the British Government.&quot; This same newspaper was recently described (almost humourously, it would seem) by a Dutchman as a subsidised organ of British propaganda!Just as the attention of the Dutch Government is concentrated on negotiations or crises first with one belligerent Government and then with an opposing one, so the press of the Netherlands other than definitely hostile or fixedly favourable organs resorts to paroxisms of invective against one side and then against the other. It must, however, be admitted that the tendency is to distribute the more vigorous criticism against the United Kingdom and the United States, and to temper bitterness with moderation when criticising German actions detrimental to Holland. Whether this reserve is due to less hostility or to a wise appreciation of the close proximity of a ruthless neighbour, is a debatable point.The third of the chief features of interest during the past few weeks has been the German demand for permission to send goods in transit across the railways of Dutch Limburg between Germany and Belgium. Very considerable uneasiness was aroused in this connection, as it was feared that the German Government would insist on the admission of material for the German armies, which would have been a direct challenge of the Netherlands declaration of the Dutch conception yf neutrality. The situation was admittedly critical, but owing to a partial, with-drawal of the German demands, a settlement has now been reached, with the benevolent, if grudging, concurrence of the Allies, and certain goods are now being forwarded between Germany and Belgium by way of Limburg, the transit having begun on the 4th June by the passage of forty truckloads of sawn timber on the way to Belgium. No definite decision has yet been reached as to the commodities which will bo allowed to pass, but material for the armies will not be permitted.The export of Colonial produce from the Netherlands East Indies has been prohibited except under licence, but it may be expected that this restriction will be modified now that the export to the Netherlands East Indies of British Indian and Colonial produce has again been authorised.The Dutch Government is about to despatch to Java a Dutch warship, a con-verted cruiser, a passenger vessel, and an accompanying collier, carrying Govern-ment passengers and Government cargo to the Netherlands East Indies. It is stated that the examination of these vessels will not be tolerated, but that inspection of papers will be permitted at the request of belligerent warships, and that due notice will be given to the Governments concerned. In view of irresponsible state-ments that an attempt was to be made to defy the Allied blockade, a public state-ment was issued on the 31st May by the Netherland Government explaining the circumstances from their point of view. Negotiations on the subject are still proceeding between London and The Hague.The Dutch elections are to take place at the end of the present month and during July.
NORWAYThe economic agreement with the United States Government was signed on behalf of the Norwegian Government by Dr. Nansen on the 30th ultimo. By it Norway agrees to limit her export to the Central Powers of minerals, chemicals, and metallur-gical products to certain fixed annual quantities ; and of such commodities and certain others specified, after provision for this export and for Norwegian home requirements, she gives purchase preference to the U.S.A. and the Allies over all other countries.Fish product exports up to 96,000 are to be divided equally between the U.S.A. with the Allies and the Central Powers, and here again any surplus is to go to the former.   No other foodstuffs are to be sent to the Central Powers.In return Norway will receive annual rations of cereals, fodder-stuffs, and other commodities, which, with the home production, should enable her to face the future without anxiety. From our point of view the direct gain is the drastic reduction in the Norwegian exports to Germany; the indirect, the allaying of the feeling of irritation inevitably produced by our blockade policy.That the economic situation in Norway had become very serious is clear from a publication of the Norwegian Food Control Department, which showed that the stores of grain and flour would-only last till the end of August, leaving (failing other supplies) two breadless months until the new harvest.An acrimonious press discussion preceded the signing of the agreement. Some Opposition papers strongly criticised the Government for not coming to terms with the U.S.A. Others declared that the Americans had put forward terms which were entirely unacceptable. The conclusion of the agreement has, too, not been received with the chorus of approval which it merits. Several Opposition papers take up a reserved attitude pending publication of details (publication has now taken place, but the press comments are not yet to hand), and warn the country that hard times are still ahead owing to the difficulty of buying and transporting the rationed supplies. Party politics are playing their usual role, and the Opposition press are unwilling to give to the Government the credit which would seem to be its clue. Leaving the press aside, there can be no doubt as to the feeling of intense relief and satisfaction of the whole Norwegian population. They have lived through very dark times and now see light again.The Bolshevik, alias Syndicalist, movement in Norway is making no headway ; on the contrary, it would seem to be losing ground steadily, except, possibly, in the far North the Tromso district-where, according to the &quot; Trondhjems Avis &quot; of the 4th May, there exists a well-oganised movement against military service, which is likely to make itself felt next spring. Otherwise there is abundant evidence of the disinclination of the bulk of the working classes to adopt anti-parliamentary methods for the redress of their grievances and the attainment of their wishes.The moderate Socialists, who were in April dispossessed of the control of the party machine, but who, despite their defeat, had at the general meeting of the party expressed their willingness to co-operate with the Syndicalists for the furtherance of Socialist aims, have issued a manifesto in which they not only protest against the new ideas of a dictatorship of the proletariat and point out the futility of military strikes and anti-parliamentary tactics, but announce that they intend to nominate their own candidates for the Storthing elections in the autumn (&quot; Tidens Tegn,&quot; 23rd April). One would have expected that this, would lead to a definite party split, but &quot; Sooial-Demokraten&quot; (26th April), the party organ, now controlled by the Syndicalist majority, instead of taking up the challenge, writes in terms which imply that there is no real difference between the old Socialism and the new. &quot; Syndicalist,&quot; it explains, is a misnomer as applied to the Majority group. Syndicalism forswears parliamentary action: Socialism seeks to obtain parliamentary power. The majority stands for Socialism, so the minority has no right to talk of bringing back the party to Social-democracy. A few days later the same paper stated that there was no reason why the majority should not give its support to candidates of the minority, &quot; who are so rich in parliamentary experience &quot; (this latter is quite true, as 23 out of 24 Socialist members of the present Storting belong to the minority groupsIt is only right to point out that the Government organ &quot; Intelligenssedler &quot; (the 4th May) maintains that the acceptance by the majority of the minority candidates [514-9]
means that the whole party has become revolutionary. But this assertion is obviously a party move with an eye to the autumn elections. Nothing would please the bourgeois parties better than that the two Socialist groups should each put up candidates, and thus split the Socialist vote; failing that, the more revolutionary the party can he made to appear in the eyes of the general public, the fewer votes it is likely to obtain.One thing is certain. The new party leaders have become quite mild and subdued-almost parliamentary in their utterances. Whether this is due to a growing feeling that violence will not pay, or whether accession to power and consequent ( responsibility has, as it often does, exercised a moderating influence, it is difficult to say. Probably both factors are at work. As regards the first, the complete breakdown of Bolshevism in Russia must have brought bitter disillusionment to many who believed that the new movement would spread everywhere rapidly and with irresistible force, bringing happiness and plenty (for the working-classes) in its train, and the military collapse of the &quot;Reds&quot; in Finland, coupled with the terrible tales of their atrocities  of which the Norwegian papers have been full have further tended to lessen the number of the supporters of the extremists. No wonder, then, if they feel that now, at any rate, is not the time violently to wave the &quot; Red &quot; flag.Another sign of the comparative impotence of the new movement was the abortive attempt of the majority to bring about a general strike on the 2nd May in order to force the Government to concede an eight hours&apos; working-day. The jtrades unions, controlled as they are by the minority, refused to countenance the strike, and the general secretariat of the workers, though it petitioned the Government to grant temporarily an eight hours&apos; working-day in view of the shortage of rations and the impossibility of work being carried on for a longer period under present conditions, took up the same attitude. The result was that in Christiania and most other towns all over the country the workmen did not down their tools. Trondhjem was the principal exception, but by the 4th May work was resumed there on the old terms pending the result of negotiations proposed by the burgomaster. The 1st May, too, passed off, as was noted in the last report, without serious disturbances in any part of , Norway, so the nervous fears of many Norwegians in a position to judge that serious trouble was brewing, which would break loose on May Day, proved to be without foundation. Credit must, however, be given to the Norwegian Government, who, in their handling of the April disturbances, showed a firmness and strength which doubtless gave food for thought to the would-be rioters and revolutionaries.
ROUMANIA.On tbe day on which last month&apos;s Report was published (7th May), the Treaty of Peace between Roumania and the Central Powers was finally signed. The full text of it appeared in the &quot; Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; on the 9th May, followed by the publication in the same paper on the .11th May of its corollary the Legal Treaty, and subsequently of the Economic Treaty and Petroleum Convention. Examination of these treaties in detail confirms the general view as to their character put forth in the last report. They are so designed as to place Roumania in future completely under the control of her late enemies. Though both German and Austrian politicians and journalists have spoken with some enthusiasm of the treaty as marking the resumption of &quot; friendly relations &quot; between Roumania and their respective countries, it is hard to imagine that any treaty could infringe more grossly the democratic principles to which the Western Powers, President Wilson, and even last year the majority of the German Reichstag, have pledged their support, and which were crystallised by the Russian Revolution in the phrase &quot; No annexations, no indemnities, and self-determination of peoples.&quot; For the sake of brevity, the general character of the treaty may be examined from the point of view of these three principles.1. Annexations.Roumania is forced to cede immediately to Bulgaria about one-third of Dobrogea, comprising the territory which she gained from Bulgaria in 1913, together with substantial &quot; frontier rectifications,&quot; bringing the Bulgarian frontier up to a line just south of the Cernavoda-Constantsa railway. She further surrenders to the four Central Powers as a whole almost all the rest of Dobrogea from this line up to the St. George&apos;s-mouth of the Danube, to be for the time being administered by them in condominium pending the solution of certain questions in dispute between Bulgaria and her Allies. (These questions, relating to the Turco-Bulgarian frontier and to Germano-Bulgarian financial relations, are discussed in this month&apos;s Bulgarian Report). The only part of Dobrogea which remains to Roumania is the small swampy corner comprising the delta of the Danube from the St. George&apos;s to the Kilia mouth. Though some ethnological justification might be found for the return to Bulgaria of the. two departments of Southern Dobrogea which Roumania annexed in 1913, inasmuch as 43 per cent, of its population of about 270,000 is Bulgar (the remainder being mainly Turk and Tatar), no such justification could possibly be put forward for the annexa-tion of Central and Northern Dobrogea where, according to Bulgarian admissions, only 14 to 18 per cent, of the population is Bulgar, at least 55 per cent, being Roumanian, while the whole economic prosperity of the province is due to the efforts made by Roumanian industry since 1878 to reclaim it from the wilderness in which they found it. Moreover, by this annexation Roumania is cut off from her natural outlet to the Black Sea, and the Central Powers, in whose hands it remains, will be able to apply to Roumania the economic pressure which for decades past Austria has been able to apply to land-locked Serbia.Hungary also is allowed to indulge in considerable annexations at the expense of Roumania. The important Danube port of Turnu-Severin is to be leased for twenty years to the Central Powers. Starting just west of it the new frontier will run, not as at present more or less along the crest of the Carpathians, but considerably to the south and east of them, at some points being pushed forward as much as thirty miles into the interior of Roumania. it is impossible in this report to describe in full the lines of this new frontier, but, generally speaking, it may be said that it is pushed forward to the foot-hills of the Carpathians, and therefore hands over to Roumania&apos;s most bitter enemy not only all the strategical entries into Wallachia and Moldavia, but also rich wooded districts and a considerable portion of the Roumanian oil-fields. Naturally no ethnical justification whatever can be discovered for this arbitrary act, based solely on the principle of vce victis! But it is characteristic of the innate chauvinism of Hungarian politicians of all parties that the Hungarian press, almost without exception, while expressing its satisfaction that the treaty has succeeded in separating Roumania and Serbia territorially, is disgusted that Hungary has not actually demanded more I One paper, the &quot;Alkotmany&quot; (9th May), indeed, considers it a true &quot;Hungarian [514-7]
peace,&quot; but most of them agree with the &quot;Pesti Hirlap &quot; (9th May), which says, &quot; It is positively pitiful to see on the map how insignificant is the difference between the old and the new frontiers of Hungary.&quot;2. Indemnities.Article 13 of the peace treaty makes the high-sounding declaration that &quot;the contracting parties mutually renounce compensation for their war costs,&quot; and the German press writes with unction on &quot;German magnanimity &quot; and the &quot; benevolence&quot; of the Central Powers in demanding no indemnities from conquered Roumania. An examination of the treaty shows how little truth there is in any such claim. Article 21, for instance, declares that &quot;after the ratification of the peace treaty the army of occupation [which is at present six to eight divisions] shall be maintained at Roumania&apos;s expense, including the necessary requisitions for it.&quot; Roumania&apos;s obligation to pay for all the requisitions of the enemy armies is retrospective. Moreover, by article 23, &quot; expenditure on public works at the cost ol&apos; the Allied Powers in the occupied terri-tories, including industrial enterprises, shall be made good to these Powers on their transfer.&apos;-&apos; Further, by article .1.2, &quot; State.property in the surrendered [to Bulgaria and Hungary] Roumanian territories shall pass to the States Avhich acquire these territories without indemnifications or burdens.&quot; Consequently, as in the case of the territories detached from Russia, the Germans are depriving Roumania, as they did Russia, of the annexed provinces&apos; share of obligation for national expenditure. From these few points which have been quoted, and from many other similar ones, it is clear how entirely false, is the German contention that they are demanding no indemnities from Roumania.3. Self-determination.What self-determination do the Central Powers leave to the mutilated Roumania whose existence they still tolerate ? In the first place, the German garrison, which is not to exceed six divisions &quot;apart from the formations used for economic purposes,&quot; remains in occupation of the country, and is to be paid for by Roumania. It is to possess the right of requisitioning all such foodstuffs and raw materials as it thinks fit. A civil official of the Occupation Administration is to be attached to each of the Roumanian Ministeries, and the Roumanian authorities must &quot; act in accordance with the regulations which the commanding officers of the army of occupation consider necessary for the security of the occupied territories.&quot; Further, for the time being means of communication, particularly railways, posts and telegraphs, will &quot; remain under military administration, though at the disposal of the authorities and population of Roumania.&quot; The Roumanian army is to be demobilised at once, with the exception of two divisions left in Bessarabia and about 30,000 men left in Moldavia, and practically all the artillery and war material are to be handed over to the custody of the enemy armies.ICconomically, a complete stranglehold is secured both over the State finance and the primary industries of the country. Roumania is forced to agree that the credits and deposits of the Roumanian National Bank at the German Reichsbank shall be held by Germany as security for the service of the Roumanian public debt, and may be drawn on for discharge of interest due to German subjects if Roumania herself falls behind with any instalment of this payment. For the next seven years at least all Roumania&apos;s surplus grain is to be at the disposal of the Central Powers for export, and similarly all her primary products will be put at the mercy of the victors. In the case of the petroleum industry, a practical monopoly is granted to a new association, in which Austrian and German capital (represented by the Deutsche Bank, Disconto-Gesellschaft, &amp;c.) will have a predominant share. Every facility for exploitation, use, and construction of railways and means of export is put at their disposal, and it will be impossible for Roumania or other firms to act independently of this association. Cases of dispute between this predominantly German association and Roumanian firms will be decided finally by a Court at Leipzig, so that the control of Roumania&apos;s vital industry will be entirely in German hands.These few instances will serve to show how the economic conditions of the treaty take away from the Roumanian people even the shadow of political self-determination. But in social and religious questions too the Central Powers are interfering in the most flagrant fashion with the natural rights of any independent State, even the smallest. It is true the Germans have disavowed any idea of interfering in Roumanian internal politics, but at the same time they have persuaded or allowed the present pro-German
Marghiloman Government to commit a gross bread) of the Constitution by dissolving the present Chamber, which sat as a Constituent Assembly, before the far-reaching democratic reforms of last July, granting universal suffrage and a redistribution of the big estates among the peasants have been put into force. The new elections are already in progress. As neither the Liberal nor Conservative democrat party is willing to contest them under the ridiculous conditions of a German military occupation, they will presumably be conducted solely by and in the interests of Marghiloman&apos;s party of reactionary landlords. There is little doubt, then, that he will succeed in obtaining a large majority in the new &quot;Parliament,&quot; which he will presumably ask to pass such &quot; reforms &quot; as he considers suitable fo&apos;r impressing public opinion without disturbing the vested interests of his Conservative friends.As regards the vexed Jewish question, the Germans have demanded a solution which is typical of their favourite policy of &quot; divide and rule.&quot; Article 28 of the peace treaty declares &quot; that all those who have no nationality (i.e., Jews) who have taken part in the war, whether on active service or auxiliary service, or those born in the country and domiciled there, and descended from parents born there, shall forthwith be regarded as Roumanian subjects with full rights, and can register themselves in the Courts as such.&quot; This apparently complete emancipation of the Roumanian Joavs is, however, much less complete than it appears on the surface. In the first place, the demand for proof that a Jew&apos;s parents were born in the country will exclude a very great part of the Jewish population from eligibility for acquiring rights of citizenship, and the simple assurance that these Jews can register themselves in the Courts as citizens in fact means that their fate Avill be decided by specially constituted Courts which can at will accept or reject them as suitable for citizenship in accordance with their willingness or otherwise to become Germany&apos;s economic tools. It is, indeed, no part of German policy to solve the Jewish question in Roumania or to heal the old quarrel of Roumanian and Jew, for it is in Germany&apos;s interest to play race against race and to force either in self-defence to look to Germany for protection against the other. German policy is, in fact, in striking contradiction to that of sincere goodwill towards both Roumanians and Roumanian Jews, to which Lord Robert Cecil on the 30th May gave expression in replying to a question in the House of Commons, when he remarked that &quot; the enfranchisement obtained (by Germany) for^the Jews is of a most limited and conditional nature, and the clauses have, in fact, been framed solely in order to give Germany an additional pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of Roumania. His Majesty&apos;s Government have the fullest sympathy with the cause of Jewish enfranchisement in Roumania and elsewhere, but it is the full programme of liberation which the Roumanian Government had themselves adopted prior to this treaty, and not this restricted scheme, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government will adhere.&quot; &quot;The full programme&quot; to which Lord Robert Cecil alluded was that announced in the Roumanian Chamber last summer by M. Take lonescu, then the Vice-President of the Council of Ministers, and at the time publicly approved by the then Prime Minister, M. Bratianu. He declared the intention of the Government to &quot; solve the Jewish question in a wide, complete, unrestricted, unreserved manner, in an honourable spirit, as indeed ought to be done by a country which has given its Avord and has to respect it.&quot;Lastly, though practically the whole nou-Jewish population of Roumania belongs to the Roumanian Orthodox Church, article 27 of the peace treaty demands that various other Churches shall have the right to establish religious communities and schools, and cannot be prevented from carrying on their work   a clause innocent in appearance but which, to judge from the past, will allow the Central Powers unrestricted opportunities of carrying on their propaganda in every corner of the country.Houmanicis International Position.These few instances which have been quoted show Iioav entirely the new peace is one imposed in violation of all international right and the consent of the peoples concerned. As if to emphasise the completely intransigeant attitude of the Central Powers, Dr. Wekerle, Hungarian Prime Minister, took the occasion of a conference of his party on the 7th May, the day of the signature of the treaty, to announce that the neAV Electoral Reform Bill was entirely satisfactory from the Magyar point of view, for, while it would enfranchise 97 per cent, of people who knew Hungarian, it would still further&apos; diminish the already insignificant political importance of the non-Magyar nationalities. In Transylvania, for instance, where the Magyar population is only 34 per cent, against the Roumanian 55 per cent., the new electoral Bill will still
further raise the Magyar proportion of the total electorate from 48&apos;9 to 5&apos;6&apos;G per cent., and lower the Roumanian percentage from 36&apos;3 to 29*6. This mark of &quot;friendship&quot; will not be lost on the Roumanian public.Roumania is at present necessarily cut off from contact with the Central Powers, but Roumanians abroad have not hesitated to denounce the treaty as one imposed by force on their country, and to identify themselves with the Entente Powers in declaring it null and void. An important public protest in this sense has just been made by the Roumanian colony in Paris, numbering some 3,000 persons, to the Allied Govern -ments. Still more practical proof of the.real wishes and interests of the Roumanian people may before long be given by the action of the Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war of Roumanian nationality in Italy and Russia. The former, who are easily accessible to the Entente Powers, number some 18,000, and a large number of them have already declared their intention of volunteering lor service with the Entente armies. Over 100,000 are scattered throughout the Russian Empire. Their wishes are hardly in doubt, but for the moment communication with them is difficult. They present, however, a potential force both materially and morally, which may ultimately find itself at the disposal of the Entente Powers.v
RUSSIA.The last month, in Russia has witnessed steady German penetration, both military and economic, in the south and north of what was formerly Russia, and the steady decline of the power of the Bolsheviks. In Finland the Germans have gained almost complete control, as is proved by General Mannerheim&apos;s resignation and the appointment of a pro-German Government, All Finnish attempts to defend their neutrality have been defeated, and the Germans are busy organising an expedition into Eastern Karelia, and building a railway to Pechenga, where they will establish a submarine base, ft is clear that the real aim of the Germans in Finland is to cut off Russia on the north from all connection with- Western Europe. The recent transference of the port of Murmansk to the Finnish Government by the Bolshevik Government is a further step in this direction, and must be resisted by the Allies by force if they are to keep their connections open with Russia, and to prevent, the establishment of submarine bases in the north.In the south of Russia the Germans have now completely occupied the territory of the so-called Ukraine. During Keivnskfs regime the Russian Government recognised the autonomy of the Ukraine, hut limited the autonomous State to the Governments of Kiev, Podolia, Volynia. Poltava, and Chernigov (with the exception of the three northern districts). The extreme Ukranian claims included, in addition to this, the Governments of Kherson, Ekaterinoslav, Kharkov, the north of Crimea, and the southern portions of the Government of Kursk. No frontiers were ever established between Russia and the Ukraine, but that is a matter of indifference to the Germans, who, in the name of self-determination, are forcing the Ukrainians to include in their new Republic the extreme claims of the Ukrainian chauvinists. The new Ukrainian Government, under the Hetmau Skoropadski, is Ukrainian only in name, and in no way represents Ukrainian interests. The Rada, which claimed to represent Ukrainian nationalism, has been dispersed by the Germans, and has to all intents and purposes ceased to exist, The only real opposition to the Germans comes from the peasants, who are conducting a savage guerilla warfare against the German troops, who are trying to seize whatever supplies of corn exist in the villages. The real object that the Germans have in view in setting up this new Ukrainian Government is to make it a stepping-stone for a new united Russia under a reactionary Government, protected by the Germans. The game of supporting a number of independent peasant republics in different parts of Russia has been abandoned by the Germans as unprofitable, and there is little doubt that the object of the Germans is to secure a reactionary Govern-ment in a new united Russia, which would then be forced into an offensive and defensive alliance with Germany.East of the Ukraine, as defined by the Germans, a new independent Government has been set up in the Don province under German protection. The Hetman of the new Don Republic is General Krasnov, and his government is supposed to extend over the territories of the Don, Kuban, and Terek Cossacks. This Government is exactly similar to that set up by the Germans in the Ukraine. It is part of the German object to surround Russia on the south and the south-east with a number of reactionary Governments, which will ultimately all come together under.German protection. This means that Germany is gradually cutting Russia off from all her richest districts. In the north the Germans are seeking to gain control of the timber supplies of the northern Governments, using Finland as a base for export purposes ; in the south and the east they are cutting Russia off from her chief resources, viz., corn, coal, oil, iron, cotton.The political situation in Russia proper shows that the Bolsheviks are steadily weakening, and that every other party is powerless. Whilst Lenin is waiting for his European revolution, the Germans are watching for the moment when economic conditions in Russia will rouse sufficient discontent against the Bolsheviks to make their fall inevitable. Under such conditions there will be no alternative left but a German-controlled Government. Thus, the latest development of German policy appears to be to play with the Bolsheviks by giving them a nominal peace, and stiffening them against any agreement with the Allies regarding intervention until Germany is herself prepared to carry out a counter-revolution on the model of that in the Ukraine. With the fall of the Bolsheviks, Russia might become politically bankrupt.   No single
party would be capable of forming a new Government which must either be reactionary under German control or national with Allied support.In viewing the political prospects one must think less of political parties than actual conditions, and the way they will affect the average man. Men of education and wide outlook such as Milyukov, Struve, and others, will continue to think first of Russia&apos;s future and will be guided by such considerations. But these men are few, and the vast majority will think merely of an immediate way out of an apparently hopeless position. Thus, this majority will undoubtedly go with whatever force can offer immediate help. After recent experiences of the Germans they will certainly prefer the Allies, but in the absence of the Allies they will have to accept the Germans.Recent reports from Petrograd show that Bolshevism in its latest phase has lost all its earlier idealism, and continues to exist merely by brute force.   In Petrograd at the present time the conditions of life are deplorable.   The population is almost entirely without food with the exception of the very rich and the hangers-on of the Bolshevik party who are now drawn from the dregs of the population.   Bolshevism, socialism, communism, and every other &quot; ism &quot; have lost all appeal that they once had. No political catch-words can be expected any longer to produce any effect upon the population as a whole.   The only hope for Russia in the near future is the revival of a national spirit, and this spirit can only be revived by a stimulus coming from outside. The presence of the Allies might go very far towards producing reaction in this direction.   Allied troops in the north of Russia would inevitably gather round.them a large number of Russians of ail classes who would prefer almost anything to the present deplorable conditions under which they are existing.   Political rivalries, having lost whatever meaning they may have possessed during the stormy months of 1917, would not be an insuperable obstacle to the establishment of a real national Government under the protection of the Allies.   Without Allied support there is no prospect of any successful counter-revolution against the Bolsheviks.   The strongest anti-Bolshevik- organisation which is at the same time anti-German is probably that , controlled by Savinkov, formerly Minister of War under Kerenski, but so far as we know the numbers of his organisation are comparatively small, and by itself it could not possibly attempt to put down the Bolsheviks with any hope of success.   Russia, if left to herself, will probably continue to exist under an enfeebled Bolshevik Government until such time as Germany chooses to re-erect a new form of Government that would suit her plans in Eastern Europe.r
11SWEDEN.The agreement between Sweden and the Allies, covering a wide field, which was signed in London on the 29th May1; will be received by a preponderating majority of the Swedish nation&quot; with heartfelt satisfaction. The fact that about a million tons of goods are now to be permitted to reach Sweden annually, of which something like half will consist of cereals and fodder, will relieve an ecohomic situation which had certainly become very serious. How serious is shown by an article in the pro-German &quot;Aftonblad &quot; (10th May)-a paper &quot;which, in the nature of things, is not likely lb exaggerate which advocates,- in order to cover the deficit till the next harvest, the use of 20,000 tons of seed corn for bread-making, the reduction of the bread ration by one-half to children under 3^ years, and its discontinuance to babies-in-arms.From the British point of view, with reference to our relations with Sweden, the conclusion of the agreement will work favourably in two ways. It will strengthen the position of the Swedish Government, which is5 certainly&quot; much better disposed towards the Allies than towards Germany, and it will, through the resumption of trade intercourse on a comparatively large scale, give us an opportunity for that &quot; peaceful penetration &quot; which, if tactfully carried out, will do niore to draw Sweden closer to us than any propaganda, work of a more obvious kind. There is evidence that the commercial classes in Sweden are becoming more and more alive to the fact that Sweden&apos;s commercial interests lie principally Westwards. One sentence in the very influential Goteborg paper &quot; Handels-Tidningeh,&quot; written with regard to Germany&apos;s domination of the Baltic, strikes the key-note: &quot; It is not to our advantage to become a vassal of a State engaged in a trade war with the Western States.&quot; The fact is that the Swedish merchants believe rightly or wrongly that the Allies and the United States of America intend economically to boycott the Central Powers for an indefinite period after the war, and they are just beginning dimly to see that what-ever may happen in the military sense in France and Belgium, there is a strong probability -that Germany will be cut off from her overseas trade, and, consequently, from essential supplies of raw material just so. long as England and the United States of America please.This is a material argument of great cogency in favour of a close connection with the Allies, and after nearly four years of war, it is the material and not the ethical appeal which touches the heart Of the neutral.Now that the agreement has been sighed, it will be interesting to note the Conservative line of attack. Probably they will declare that ari agreement is all very well, but that it would be advisable not to start crowing until the goods have been delivered (a pro-German paper, &quot; Aftonblad,&quot; of the 5th May, has&apos; asserted that the maize imported under the modus vivefidi agreement was hot even&apos; fit for fodder). The principal arguments against the agreement in the Conservative press during the last month have been that it was no rise making agreements&apos; With, a Power which was capable of acting as England had done towards Holland; that, if an agreement were arrived at with the Allies, It would lead to reprisals from Germany, and that the required foodstuffs could be obtained from the Ukraine. These foodstuffs&apos; from the Ukraine have well served their tiirn in the Conservative press. Admiral Lindman, when he made his circular tour of the Capitals of the Central Powers, was commonly reported to have gone smith in search df Ukraine foodstuffs. Oh his fetiirh he made no mention of them, probably for&apos; -the ebtioiis f&apos;ea;s6fi that they were hot to be nacf. It was not till the middle of May; that it was acknowledged in a pfo-Germah paper that no corn could now be got ftfoffi the (Jkfaine-the reason beiiig that Austria had need of it though high prospects were held 6ii  that, owing to the intensive cultiva-tion by Germany of the territories occupied hf Mr; large siipplie^ mipt be Hoped for next year!The Liberai-S66ialist defence of their bMtidkdittk t6-&apos; cpMtM&amp;an agreement were quite simple..

With regard to Swedish tonnage feqiiirM by tU Allies&quot;/ it fig f&amp;ihtei! oHit that the^ (the Allies) were in a position to requisition more tonnage lying in their ports than would be at their disposal under an agreement a sufficient reason for not riding the high horse.One incident connected with the Conservative anti-agreement campaign is worth notice. At the time when it was essential for shipowners to place their ships at the disposal of the Swedish Government, in order to provide the amount of tonnage to be [514-12]
chartered to the Allies, Mr. Axel Johnson, a well-known pro-German, of the Nordstjerna Shipping Company, came forward with an offer to transport 30,000 tons of wheat from the Argentine free of charge. There can be no doubt that this apparently generous offer was made, if not with the intention of wrecking the agree-ment, at least with the object of preventing the Nordstjerna ships from having to enter the danger zone. The offer was not accepted by the Swedish Government, and the papers even those which advised its acceptance-seemed doubtful, firstly, as to whether Mr. Johnsen&apos;s motives were particularly altruistic; secondly, as to the likely attitude of the Allies towards the transport of corn fetched under such conditions. Branting&apos;s comments on the Johnson offer brought down on him the wrath of the Conservative press. He expressed the view that Sweden would only be able to get foodstuffs by agreement with the United States of America and the Allies, and that with regard to neutral trade, no one could expect the idyllic pre-war conditions to be maintained. &quot; Svenska Dagbladet,&quot; a reputable, though strongly pro-German, paper, insisted that such an attitude more than anything else must encourage the English Government and Wilson to cast aside any scruples they may have about the abandonment of their declared principles, and declared that the Northcliffe propaganda Minister (whoever he may be) may as well be recalled as Branting is excellent at his work. Mr. Branting, however, is well able to take care of himself, and hits back vigorously and with effect in occasional articles in &quot; Social-Demokraten.&quot;The addition to the German Prize Law, by which a ship is declared liable to attack if it belongs to a nation which has made a tonnage agreement with the Allies, or more than half of whose fleet is in the Allied service, naturally caused some perturbation. But it is likely that the visit of the Swedish delegates, Trolle and Sachs, to Berlin, was for the purpose among other matters of securing Germany&apos;s consent to those parts of the Anglo-Swedish Agreement which concern tonnage and restriction of Swedish iron-ore exports to the Central Powers, and that their mission was successful one is inclined to wonder at what price. According to the Malmo Socialist paper, *&apos; Arbetet,&quot; of the 15th May, safe-conduct passes are being granted to- Swedish ships on condition that they keep out of the war zone and are not convoyed.The Finns are not popular in Sweden at the present time. The fact that they intended Sweden to be a catspaw is generally accepted in Government circles, if a Dagens Nyheter &quot; article may be accepted as authoritative, and as the editor of this paper, von Zweigbjerg, is a very intimate friend of Mr. Hellner, the Foreign Minister, there is every reason to believe that this is the case. &quot; Dagens Nyheter &quot; declares that Swedish military intervention was asked for, in order &quot; to relieve Germany of an enterprise she would gladly have been quit of.&quot; This article has further interest, as it warns Finland that if she wishes to be on friendly terms with Sweden she must refrain from accusations of &quot; treachery,&quot; and, above all, break away from the ultra-Conservative Swedish clique^ a representative of which, as &quot; Dagens Nyheter &quot; significantly points out, has advocated Swedish annexation of the Aland Islands. Even the Conservatives are becoming very critical of the Finns, and for this the latter have themselves to thank. The adulation of the Germans (at the expense of the Swedes), the hostility in Finland of the true Finns to the Swedish element, the apparently systematic agitation against the Swedes on the Aland Islands, and a very tactless article in a Finnish paper, which pointed out that Stock-holm was within easy reach of long-range guns from the Alands, all these have led to an anti-Finnish reaction in the more moderate Conservative circles. Both &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; and &quot; Stockholms Dagbladet,&quot; Conservative papers which are first Swedish, not in all essentials German as are certain Conservative papers, have expressed their indignation with some violence.The position of the Swedish Government is certainly strengthened by the cooling of the enthusiasm1 for the Finnish &quot;Whites.&quot; Anti-Swedish feeling in Finland tends also to justify the Government policy of non-intervention, and blunt the weapons of the ultra-Conservatives who still loudly proclaim that military inaction has led to the estrangement of Finland and the loss of the Alands.
UNITED STATESThe present month has shown a further development of the two chief tendencies in American opinion, which were observed during April-an intensification of the war spirit consequent upon the renewal of the German offensive in March, and a cleter-mination to expedite American preparations lest the war should be decided before the United States had thrown its weight into the scale.&quot; I have heard gentlemen recently say that we must get 5,000,000 men ready,&quot; said President Wilson, speaking at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York on the 18th May ; &quot; but,&quot; he asked, &quot; why limit it to 5,000,000 ? I have asked the Congress of: the United States to name no limit, because Congress intends, I am sure as we all intend, that every ship that can carry men or supplies shall go laden on every voyage with every man and every supply she can carry.&quot;The President doubtless expresses the feeling of the American people. During May the embarkation of American troops for Europe proceeded at a very satisfactory rate, and the unexpectedly heavy new drafts of men who were called to the training camps arrived punctually and with enthusiasm.On the 23rd May, Mr. Baker, Secretary for War, appeared before the Military Committee of the House to recommend an amendment to the Army Bill, authorising the President to call up such number of men for military service as he is able to train and equip, and to use them to bring about a successful termination of the war; this recommendation was unanimously adopted. On the following day, the Senate Military Committee unanimously voted in favour of a large expansion of the American army. The President has sanctioned drastic regulations under the Draft Law, under which every man of draft age who is not employed in an essential occupation must enlist or seek war work after the 1st July. Legislation for compulsory civilian labour has been passed by the State Legislatures of Maryland, West Virginia, New Jersey, South Dakota, and New York.Such is the present temper of the American people.&quot; Every American who speaks to me,&quot; writes an English journalist now in the United States, &quot; begins or ends by lamenting that his country has not been able to do more.&quot; &quot; We are building ships,&quot; said Mr. Gompers, speaking at the Canadian Club ; &quot; we are going to build more ; and we are going to keep on building, fighting, producing until the Hun is crushed.&quot; A vice-consul on the Pacific Coast reports that each of the inhabitants in his district feels that every foot of ground won by Germany is becoming a personal debt which must be collected by himself.It is difficult to say precisely to what extent this war enthusiasm has been translated into the most effective and desirable forms of activity. In some places one of its most noticeable results was increased bitterness against enemy aliens. Many columns of the American papers are devoted to accounts of the tarring and feathering of real or supposed German sympathisers, to the desirability or unclesirability of discontinuing the teaching of German in the schools, and to the advisability of boycotting the German-American newspapers, two important samples of which--Hearst&apos;s &quot;Deutsches Journal&quot; and the &quot;Brooklyn Freie Presse&quot; have ceased publication during the last few weeks. Vigilance committees have been established in some localities to investigate the sympathies of citizens suspected of befriending the enemy, and further arrests of such persons by Federal agents are constantly reported in the press.On the other hand, there is the really remarkable record of practical achievement furnished by the Third Liberty Loan, which was heavily over-subscribed, and the collection of 28,800,0001. in a single week for the Red Cross. Such signs indicate that popular enthusiasm over the war is solid and practical. This is indicated also by the improvement in the labour situation. The attitude of the I.W.W. and other Labour extremists in the Far West and the general friction between labour and employers throughout the country, which has constituted one of the most serious obstacles to speedy production since the beginning of the war, have given place to an improved atmosphere, partly owing to the increasing intervention of the Government in the standardisation of hours, wages, and conditions of work, though serious strikes in important industries still occur e.g., in the Bethlehem Steel Works, in the Telegraphy Companies, and in the garment trade in St. Louis. Improved war feeling is also noticeable in the American Socialist party.   The majority of that
party are tending to return to the position of the pro-war minority, which seceded after the St. Louis convention a year ago. Jewish and Bohemian Socialists have passed pro-war resolutions, and the seven Socialist aldermen of Ncav York voted for the Third. Liberty Loan, though they were severely criticised for this by a considerable section, of the New York Socialists.Congress is also showing the effect of the growing concentration of public sentiment on the war. Republican partisan criticism has indeed shown itself in dealing with the Administration^ proposals for increased direct taxation and more drastic legislation against sedition, but this criticism has not been pushed to the length of serious opposition. As regards the question of taxation, the recurring strain of the loan campaigns and the danger of inflation has led the Administration to oppose the raising of further sums of money by loan without increasing taxation. President Wilson, on the 27th May, addressed a joint Session of Congress and urged the passage of legislation to raise 800,000,00(JL additional revenue towards the expenses of the war. The President appealed to the patriotism of the Assembly, which would normally be reluctant to impose additional taxation only a few months before an election. &quot; The consideration,&quot; he said, &quot; that dominates every other now and makes every other seem trivial and negligible is winning the war.&quot;American opinion has not given to the agitation against conscription in Ireland that measure of support which Irish appeals have hitherto received in the United States. On the contrary, the American newspapers have for the most part stated that if Ireland refuses to perform a duty which Irishmen in every other part of the world have accepted, she will forfeit the good-will of, the American people. They add, however, that conscription should&apos; be accompanied by a generous measure of Home Rule ; and some of them regret that it was not found possible to grant Home Rule first and impose conscription subsequently. It is clear that American opinion as a. whole would support conscription accompanied by Home Rule; but it is doubtful how the American public would regard undue postponement of the Home Rule Bill, even should this be accompanied by the abandonment of conscription. Moreover, while supporting the principle of conscription, American opinion might be unfairly critical of the steps necessary to enforce it.At&quot; no time has there, been less talk of peace in, the American papers. It would not,, of course, be true to say that the pacifists have disappeared.; but they are hushed, and have bowed before the wave of American war enthusiasm. President Wilson undoubtedly had the support of public opinion when he said on the 18th May : &quot; And we are not to be diverted from the grim purpose of winning the war by any insincere approaches upon the subject of peace. 1 can say with a clear conscience that I have tested those intimations and have found them insincere. 1 now recognise them for what they are, an opportunity to have a free hand, particularly in the East, to carry out the purposes of conquest and exploitation. Every proposal with regard to accommodation in the West involves a reservation with regard to the East.&quot;The Presidents statement in a later part of this speech, that he intended to stand by Russia as well as France, aroused some discussion in the American press. The papers generally assumed that the United States did not contemplate intervention in the Far East and that the President merely intended to imply that the war must continue until a peace could be obtained which would fulfil the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of Russia.But the chief obstacle to speedy war production in the United States has from the beginning lain, not in the state of public sentiment, but in the lack of co-ordination and initiative in the administrative departments. It is not yet possible to say to what extent the many recent appointments of leading business men like J. D. Ryan and E. R, Stettinius, and the exercise by the President of the powers of redistribution and reorganisation in the Government departments conveyed to him in the Overman Bill, will result in greater efficiency and co-ordination. Critics of the Administration still blame the Government, and many sections of public opinion still blame Congress, for a condition of affairs which seems even now to be regarded as not wholly satisfactory. As a matter of fact, the Administration at Washington has always had the assistance of a certain number of very competent business men, and the weakness of the Administration has consisted rather in the failure to concentrate power and responsibility in their hands. So far as can be seen at present, Mr. Ryan&apos;s appointment as Controller of Aircraft Production does mark a concentration of responsibility, and though his task will clearly remain a very heavy one for some time to come, there is little doubt that in this department American war preparations have turned the corner. The same may be said of Mr. Schwab&apos;s appointment to the control of Shipbuilding.    The actual state of the shipbuilding programme
is always a little difficult to estimate. Mr. Schwab promised on the 23rd May that 10,000 tons of shipping would be &quot; delivered&quot; every working day during that month. More recently, Mr. Hurley has announced that the  i output &quot; for May has been 263,000 tons deadweight. It is not clear whether this refers to launchings or completions, but it certainly includes craft of every kind. The output during the first four months of this year was, according to the published statements of the Commissioner of Navigation, 91,541, 132,100, 166,700, and 240,000 deadweight respectively, and it may be observed that April figures were only said to &quot; slightly exceed the record of last June.&quot; The best figures at our disposal give the launchings of steel tonnage for the first five months of the year as 79,000, 100,000, 141,000, 99,000, and 168,000 gross tons respectively, in round numbers. As against these unsatisfactory figures, it is to be remembered that the construction of the three great &quot; fabricated ship &quot;-yards has only just been completed, and the output during the last six months of this year will probably be so greatly increased as to eliminate serious anxiety regarding the shipping resources of the Allies. The railway administration under Mr. McAdoo is another&apos;instance of the concentration of responsibility. Contracts have now been placed, for 100,000 standard freight cars and a large number of locomotives, but it still remains doubtful whether Mr. McAdoo will be able to avert another transportation crisis next winter, and freight congestion even now is still a cause of complaint and anxiety.If these are instances of sound concentration of responsibility, it is very doubtful whether the same can be said of the reconstitution of the War Industries Board or the policy of the Administration in regard to labour. In both these cases the Administration still seems tied to a system of co-operative co-ordination of various departments rather than one of concentration of powers and responsibility. The reorganisation of the War Industries Board does indeed provide for the creation of a Requirements Division, through which all the orders of the various purchasing departments must pass, but this was the original idea of the Board when it was created last year, and its failure to enforce co-ordination on the departments was due to its lack of rapid machinery for dealing with requirements. The chairman of the Board has great power, but past experience has shown that in a system of organisation dependent upon voluntary co-ordination, such power can more easily be used for obstruction than for construction. No doubt, however, the present crisis has established closer relations between (for instance) the Shipping Board and the War- DepartmenW/fr-the one hand, and the War Industries Board on the other, and it is probable that the authority of the Board will be more clearly defined by the President, step by step, as the pressure increases. It is to be hoped that a similar development may soon take place in the BoarcVs powers over industry itself. At present its control over prices and the disposal of output seems to be&apos; still confined to co-operative consultation with representatives of the various industries and to indirect means of pressure such as threats to refuse fuel and transportation facilities to recalcitrant firms. Even where it has definite powers of coercion by its control over imported raw materials, or in the case of tin, its ability to control industry in practice seems to be limited. In the same way, in the sphere of labour policy authority over labour conditions has been centralised neither in the War Industries Board as representing war production, nor in the Labour Administration as representing Labour, but has been confided to as many as three advisory and interdepartmental councils. There is a National Labour-Board, representing employers and employed under the joint chairmanship of Mr. Taft and Mr. Walsh ; there is a board representing the various bureaux of the Labour Department itself, which have hitherto been both ill-staffed and ill-co-ordinated ; and, thirdly, there is now a War Labour Policies Board representative of the Labour, War, Navy, and Agricultural Departments, the Emergency Fleet Corporation, the Railroad Administration, the War Industries Board, and the National Labour Board. This War Labour Policies Board has indeed been placed under the chairmanship of a man of great ability, knowledge, and energy, and his programme is a most ambitious.one, covering the supply and the regulation of labour, but, owing to the nature of its constitution, progress will mainly depend on his personal tact.The restriction of imports and exports for the purpose of conserving tonnage has progressed very satisfactorily under the general direction of the Shipping Board, and American sacrifices of trade in this direction must be warmly recognised. These measures have, however, given rise to considerable apprehension at the various meetings of commercial organisations during April and AJay. Those meetings-especially those of the Chambers of Commerce, the Foreign Trade Council, and the Cotton Association have been the occasion for many very interesting discussions regarding3i
trade policy after the war, and the sentiment in favour of adopting a definite policy of reconstruction and &quot;better measures of co-operation with the Allies appears to be rapidly developing among leading business men.The organisation of the War Finance Corporation and the Capital Issues Committee marked a very noteworthy step forward in the direction of the control of business for war purposes, and of a constructive policy of assisting enterprises necessary to the prosecution of the war. The powers given to the War Finance Corporation in this latter respect will in all probability he turned to the work of social and economic reconstruction as time goes on.
