Release of men born in years 1895 - 1899.

Recommendation to tho War Cabinet on W.P.94 of the War Priorities Committee.

The War Priorities Committee having considered the attached recommendations of the permanent (Labour) Sub-Committee (W.P.94) were of opinion that it is necessary to make the clean out of Grade 1 men born in the years 1898 or 1899 immediately effective and resolved to recommend to the War Cabinet that no Grade 1 man born in those years should be retained after June 30th in any occupation in Admiralty or Ministry of Munitions firms other than an occupation for which an age limit of 19 is fixed in the Schedule of protected Occupations (M.M.130 Revised).

In view of the Cabinet decision limiting the Admiralty quota to 12,500 men to be released by June 3oth and the possibility that this clean out might have the effect of producing a larger quote, the Admiralty felt itself precluded from agreeing to this resolution without a decision of the War Cabinet.

With regard to the further recommendation of the Labour Sub-Committee as to men born in the years 1897, 1896 or 1895, the War Priorities Committee approved the principle of making the clean cut effective in the case of Grade 1 men born in those years, but they remitted the question to the Labour sub-Committee to report as early as possible as to the necessity for and practicability of excluding any particular occupation and as to the possibility of providing a measure of elasticity.

This-will entail a further-revision of the Schedule raising the ages at which..men are at present &quot;protected&quot; in-many occupations.     The Committee is of opinion that this would meet with strenuous opposition unless the younger men were first withdrawn..J
