x CABi(ThHisty of, ou/jSfERING ^ p0R TIP WAR CABINET.Ji S tJh6 / Mil^ ^BALtJ^^SPJM^LJIL THE MEDITERRANEAN27At the discussion today at tho Cabinet on tho Med-iterranean Naval Situation, it was arranged that tho Memorandum which I had prepared for the Cabinet, but which had not yet been circulated, should now be forwarded, so that representations through diplomatic channels could be made by this Country, together with the Americans and the French, as we believed that similar Memoranda were being sent in by Admiral Sims and Admiral De Bon to their respective Governments in ac-cordaic e with informal arrangements which we made after the termination of the recent Meetings of the Allied Naval Council.     The Memorandum ia accordingly attached,I have ascertained from Admiral De Bon and Admiral Sims that they have made these representations to their respective Governments, and therefore, as the ground was fairly traversed today it will probably not be considered necessary to discuss the matter further at the Cabinet, and I presume that the Foreign Office, in consultation with the Admiralty, will send the necessarycommunication to Sir Rennell Rodd,I learn informally from Paris that M. Clemeneeau does not think that the moment&apos; is opportune to press the Italians -owing to their recent success in sinking an Austrian Battle Ship, coupled with the Military Offensive in which the Navy is co-operating on the right of the Army, but that when the latter subsides he will bo prepared to take action.17,6.18.(Signed) ERIC GEDDES.
21 9IM^BMDM EQB SB MS OABITO.CQICAND IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.In continuation of ray Moraorandum G.T/4788 dated the 8th June, 1918, on tho above subject, I desire to inform the War Cabinet of the further-developments of tho situation.Tho Allied Naval Council has mot this week and Italy was not represented by Vico-Admiral di Revel, tho Chief of the Italian Naval General Staff and Coimwider-in^hief of tho Italian Navy, but by Rear-A&amp;miral Conto Sriangi di Madorno, Deputy Chief of tho Italian Naval General Staff,   It was apparent during the discussions at the Allied Naval Council that Admiral Triangi had come with instructions to agree to no oc-operation which he could avoid, and that the whole attitude of the Italian Navy, as represented by him, was that it should bo kept m a water-tight compartment, prepared to seek all the help that t   tho Allies could give, but not prepared to share or co-operate * in anyway.     This attitude was undoubtedly, in our opinion, the outcome of and sequence to the tactics adopted by Admiral di Revel in blocking the question of the appointment of an Admirali8si.no in tho -Mediterranean at the Meetings of the Supreme War Council at Versailles last week,     Two subjects came up for discussion and it is necessary to give the War Cabinet some details of thorn, -The first was the question of making the host uso, by moans of an Inter-Allied survey, of the Warship repairing facilities in tho Mediterranean.     It was not proposed to exercise any executive control at all, but it will be realised that tho best results, as all experience during the War has proved, cannot bo obtained if facilities are kept in water-tight compartments, and the proposal was that the British, French and Italian Dockyard and repairing facilities, together with tho Greek facilities - which aro practically controlled by tho British, $aval Mission there - should all be subject to review and to co-ordination both as regards the nature of repairs, the time occupied for repairs, and the dis-tribution of&quot;materials, by an Inter-Allied Conference of Naval Dockyard Offloors, probably located at Rome *     Tho Italians were prepared to agree to such a Conference, but declined to bring their Warship repairing facilities within its purview, although tho British afrl French wore willing to do so, and tho Americans were strongly in favour of such an arrangement.Tho seeond item was a direct sequence to the refusal of tho Italians &amp;t tho Versailles Council last week to join thoir Battle Squadron with the stronger, French Squadron at Corfu, although in principle it was agreed that strategically this would be sound, and although as set out in Admiralty Memorandum dated 8th June (G.T. 4788) Allied Naval opinion on the Council, apart,from Italian, is unanimous in favour of this re-arrangement.The French submitted to the Council that since apparently the Italians did not propose to exercise or use their Battle Squadron, and as they wore looking only to the Adriatic, &quot;it was essential that the British and French Light Forces at&quot;present based on Brindisi for the maintenance and protection of the Barrage In the Straits .of Otranto, should be placed under the Command of the French Admiral at Corfu, so that in the event of his battle Squadron having to engage the Austrian Fleet ho would have light forces to screen his Battleships.     in spite of the unanimous opinion of the other Naval Members of tho Council, the Italians/ Vfero opposed to this, saying there was no need for it, and pleading the Naval Conventions entered into when they first cameinto the..,,
into the War as a justification for retaining under them the four British Light Cruisers based on Brindisi, although it is obvious that the Italians are looking to the French to fight the Austrian Battle Fleet if it comes out.

In addition to these two points in which the attitude of the Italians was most marked, there was another item on the Agenda in which the Shipping Controller, through the Allied Maritime Transport Council, was urging economy in the use of Merchant tonnage by the Allied Navies, and it was perfectly clear from the attitude of the Italians that they were only prepared to consider economies in the use their Navy makes of Merchant ships provided those ships were not put into the Allied pool but were retained for Italy.

We have therefore this situation in addition to the General Battle Fleet situation brought to the notice of the Cabinet in Admiralty Memorandum G.T. 4788, viz:- that the Mediterrarean is infested with submarines, all of which are based on Austrian ports; that the Italians have light forces which any other Navy would use for hunting and harassing these submarines; that they do nothing to prevent the exit of submarines? from Austrian ports; that they do not co-operate in the Otranto Barrage; that they do not even provide sufficient escort craft for their own sea-borne supplies; and that our Light Forces under great difficulties and with no help from the Italians have to hunt the submarines which come out of the Adriatic simply because the Italians will not agree to "team play".

After the Allied Naval Council had concluded its deliberations, I held a Meeting with Admiral De Bon, (France), Admiral Sims (United States of America), and the First Sea Lord, and we discussed the situation. As an outcome of th? discussion we agreed that the three Admiralties should make representations to their Governments on the lines of this Memorandum. It was considered better not to submit a joint Memorandum, nor indeed to compare Memoranda, before submission. In our opinion the time has arrived when judicious pressure might be brought to bear in order to bring about a reasonable spirit of co-operation in the Italian Navy.

I regret to have to bring a personal note of adverse comment into this Memorandum, but the attitude of Admiral di Revel at Versailles, the information we have as to his attitude upon his return to Rome, and the instructions he gave to Admiral Triangi before the latter left Rome to attend this Council, force me to the conclusion - which is shared by the First Sea Lord, Admiral De Bon and Admiral Sims - that Admiral di Revel, and he alone, is responsible for the present state of affairs and for the inactivity of the Italian Light Naval Forces, which do nothing to co-operate with those of Great Britain, France, and the United States of America in anti-submarine work, and also for the general policy of which we complain.
