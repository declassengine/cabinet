Thin Ho^Lfm^nt is fhr*, Property of / vHis Britannic (Viajosty&apos;s Government,    z $tj^NOTE BY THE GENERAL STAFF ON E CAUCASUS AND ITS VALUE TO GERMANY.(itor the purposes of this memorandum the boundaries of the Caucasus are taken as those existing before the war and no account has been taken of the provisions of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.)The Caucasus consists of an area of about 181,000 square miles, nearly equal to the whole of Eranoe.   The population according to returns for January 1st 1915 was 13,229,100 composed of a diversity of nationalities, Russians, Armenians, Circassians, Georgians, Persians, Tartars etc.. speaking over 100 different languages and dialects.Geographical features and Climate.nriiiTr-rwrinnrninir wniiiii  mirm i mi mi i wmm mmm.....&apos;i muni urn tmmm      mm . mini.....mm   .....*\im$ fliirnwrii.....The country is divided into two distinct halves, by tha great mountain range, which stretches for 950 miles from N*W. to S *B*The North-Eastern slope of the Caucasus is drained by the rivers Terek and Kuban, which flow over the typical Russian .-steppe to the North of the range.   To the South of the mountains lies Trans-Caucasia, which in turn may be separated into two parts, one comprising the Black Sea littoral, which is well irrigated and has a warm climate, the other the valley of the Kura river, flowing through desert plains towards the Caspian Sea.The climate varies from Arctic to sub-tropical.Agricultural Products.The cereal production of the Caucasus for the year 1915 including wheat, maize, rye, barley, beans and peas, amounted to approximately h million tons.   It has teen computed by the International Bureau of Agriculture at Rome that 787 pounds represents the annual requirements per head of population, of these foodstuffs, including the amount necessary for the feeding of cattle; on this basis the requirements of the Caucasus for home consumption are about Ai million tons.   In addition to this of the total production, roughly 900,000 tons, are required for seed, and it is estimated that owing to the war, and the Revolution, production has been reduced by 20)* since 1915, but even so a surplus of some 300,000 tons would be available an amount which could certainly be increased substantially if modern methods of agriculture were adopted.CottoneCotton growing has not yet been fully developed, but there ie no doubt that the introduction and extension of a proper system of irrigation would enable the orop to be largely increased.   One estimate gives 100,000 tons as the figure to which the annual yield could easily attain. : The 1916 crop amount-ed to about 25,000 tons, the figures for 1917 are not available, but the bulk of the crop is understood to be still on hand.Wool.The &quot;tool clip for 1914 amounted to 24,000 tons.   No figures are available of subsequent date.Tobacco.In 1914 the production of this plant was nearly 225 millionlbs
lbs: the popular Russian cigarettes are manufactured from Caucasian tobacco.Tea.rAround Batoum, on the Black Sea, the tultivation of tea is developing rapidly and the elimate has proved very suitable. The production has been more than doubled since 1905: in 1914 it was 334,204 lbs.In addition to the above, mention may be made of Silk and beekeeping, the greater portion of the eilk produced was exported to Marseilles and Milan.In 1912 the production of honey was 5,653,302 lbs, and of wax 666,820 lbs: this industry tould be largely developed.Animals.In 1914 the numbers of the -thief domestic animals in the Caueaaus were approximately as follows: Hcrses 2 million, cattle 6i million, sheep 13i million, goats 1 million, pigs l  million.Timber.Another important potential source of wealth in the Cauoasus consists in the forests which have as yet hardly been exploited at all, so much so in fact that the production of timber in the district does not equal the demand, and considerable quantities are brought to Batoum from other Russian ports*It is estimated that in 1913 there were 10,000,000 acres of forests, along the shores of the Black Sea, chiefly of Oak, Pine, Bir&amp;h, Beeoh etc, besides fine varieties of Boxwood and Walnut.Fisheries.The total average yield Of the Trans-Caucasian fisheries is estimated at about 480,000 tons, valued at 39,800,000 roubles. These fisheries are an important source of revenue especially those of the Caspian Sea, where the catch is principally herring; the Kura is said to be the richest sturgeon river in the world, and produces a large part of the Caviare shipped from Astrakhan.Mineral Resources.Except as regards the production of Oil, Manganese, and Copper, but little has as yet been done to develop the vast mineral resources of the Caucasus.   In addition to these, occurences of -all the important minerals have been recorded, such as Silver-lead,&apos; &apos; zinc, nickel,&apos;&apos; mercury, and gold besides pyrites, Coal, graphite, asbestos, and a variety of others too numerous to mention: in the sketch map appended the distribution of some of these is shown.Manganese.Some of the richest deposits of manganese ors in the world are to be found in the Caucasus in the Province at Kutais. At a rough estimate the deposits extend over an area of 55 square miles with an average yield of 40?&quot; of manganese.   The quantity annually exported from Batoum and Poti in normal times has reached one million tons, but this export has practically oome to a standstill since the war.   The Chiaturi deposits are estimatedto
to contain 110,000,000 tons manganese ore; from that district the export of manganese to Germany in 1913 was 411,000 tons and in 1914 332,000 tons; altogether for ten pre-war years Germany took from 41 per cent to 47 per cent of the total quantity exported.dormer.There are vast deposits of copper which are aa yet comparatively untouched.     The actual output was in:-1913 1914 191510,003 tons.        7,123 tons. 6,000 tons (approx).The decrease in 1914 and 1915 is due to the temporary occupation of the mines by the Turks and to labour troubles.Mineral Oil.It is probably not too much to eay that the greatest economic importance of the Caucasus lies in the oil-fields. These are divided into four groups, with an annual production as follows given in tons:-1915.Baku district. &apos;   7,136,000Grozny 1,408,000Cheleken Island. 176,000Maikop 128,000The main ehannel for distribution within the Russian Empire was the Volga, which, however, is ice-bound between November and April.   The usual practice has been to store about 75^ of the production until the opening of navigation, the remaining 25^ being distributed by rail and pipe line.   The 8 inch pipe lines running from Baku to Batoum, and from Grozny to Petrovsk are capable of conveying 1,500,000 tons and 500,000 tons of oil products a year respestively.   Labour troubles have, however, considerably affected the output, and at the present time practically no oil at all is being pumped through these pipes lines.An estimate of the production for 1918 gives 400,000 tons per month as the probable production of the Baku fields and 72,000 tons per month for Grozny, but it is very doubtful whether this latter figure will be reached as the ISouthern portion of the field has been destroyed by fire.   These figures show a big deeline from the 1915 output and when the local demands for railways etc. are satisfied it does not appear likely that there will be a large quantity available for export until the labour conditions are improved-.Railvfays and C onward cat ions.-The main line of communication between Southern Russia and the Caucasus runs from Rostov-on-Don through Vladikavkaz, to Grozny and thence to Petrovsk, after which it skirts the shores of the Caspian to Baku; branches from this main line serve the ports of Novoroesisk and Tuapse on the Black Sea.     South of the mountains the Caspian and Black Seas are more directly connected by the line from Baku to Poti and Batoum, through Tiflis;   -Which town is also linked up by rail with Kars and further south.Reports have been received that the railway line between Tiflis and Baku has been destroyed for a distance of 66 miles,all
All communication be Ween these towns being severed with consequent interruption of traffic between the Caspian and Black Seas.These railways make a very complete system of communica-tion, which the Germans will be able to restore speedily to a state of efficiency.    At present owing to the spread of Bolshevism and labour troubles in addition to an ever-growing shortage of Uaterials their oarrying capacity is reduced^     However there are large repair*,shops fully equipped with modern machine tools and appliances at Ros-tov-on^Hon besides smaller ones at Tiflie.There are good harbours on the shores of the Black Sea, of which the principal are 3atourn, poti, Novorossisk, and Tuapse all of which are connected by rail with the Caspian where the chief ports are Baku and petrovsk*According to the latest information the tonnage available on the Black sea amounts to about 415,000 tons; while on the Caspian there were in 1913, 2^2 steam vessels with a tonnage of 111,054, besides 55&amp; sailing vessels of nearly the same tonnage.CONCLUSIONS*The Caucasus has an annual production of cereals sufficient to allow a considerable export, and in addition there are now known to exist in the country vast stores of corn in stacks which has remained un-threshed from the harvests of recent years.The production of Oil and Uanganeae is already developed so far that large supplies are available for export:   there is also no inconsiderable quantity of woo,!, besides certain quantities 0*&quot; pot ton, two commodities of Immense value to Germany.     There are als&quot;o ample resources of valuable timber and important deposits 0*&quot; copperi     Cotton at present is not to be found anynhere within the German Empire, a fact which emphasises the value of this territory;   the same can be said of tea, and it seems certain that the Germans will be able to obtain supplies of the rarer minerals from the hitherto unexploited resources of the country.Thus it is no exaggeration to say that in the future the Caucasus could provide for Germany, besides a very large supply Of foodstuffs, nearly every raw material she requires3The immediate value to the Germans of the Cauoasua depend almost entirely on the extent to which it may prove possible to overcome transport difficulties.&quot;When the general condition of the railways in Russia and the limited amount of rolling stock is taken into account it is dear that only a limited export traffic   can take place between the Central Powers and the Caucasus through Russia.The alternative route at the moment is across the Black Sea to the mouth of the Danube, for which there are more than 400,000 tons of shipping available.     But the central Powers will only be able to draw additional supplies by this route at the expense of exports from. Roumania and Southern Russia.   Even if &quot;the carrying capacity of the Danube were increased from the present estimated total of three and a half million tons, to six million tons per annum, a possible increase which will take a considerable time to effect, it would not suffice for the increased exports from...the Ukrainu, and southern Russia.    An important advantagewhi ch
1 t *291which, however, will accrue to the Central Powers will be the Powers of choice between the products of Caucasus and of Roumania, so that for instance they will be able partially to make good the shortage of wanganeee or copper, by Importing it in preference to supplies of food or fodder from the Ukraine.   On the other hand if the question is considered from a post-bellum standpoint enormous advantages to Germany are apparent.   Some indication has already been given of the vast natural resources of the country: the mere catalogue is sufficient to explain their value, and the possession of such a country might to a large extent compensate Germany for tho loss of her Colonies, or for any economic restrictions that may haape? her trade after the war.Apart from ite undeveloped possibilities the Caucasus could under the domination of the Central Powers provide immediately after the conclusion of peace, an abundant supply of oil and manganese, which are both of vital importance; while the opening of the Dardanelles and the Mediterranean would to a great extent solve the present difficulties of transport.There is also the importance to Germany of obtaining a &quot; . large volume of exports for exchange with other countries, part-icularly with Russia  and Turkey in both of which countries she intends to develop her trade to the utmost.    These exports would greatly improve her balance of trade and would be a great help to her in restoring her Foreign Exchanges.There are already many indications that the Germans are anxious to take over the oil wells of the Caucasus.   Their authorities regard petroleum as of the utmost importance in future &quot; trade, and they point out the importance of the Caucasus in this direction as even under Russian Control it yielded 20 per cent of the world*s production.That the Germane have adopted their usual business methods, with success, in the Caucasus may perhaps be 4aken as an indication Of their foresight; and the interests which they have already acquired will facilitate the final absorption of the country: this applies especially to the manganese industry in which Germans were busy acquiring claims and buying up mines.,   finally and most important of all, the possession of the  aueatuft tfOulA be yet another atep forward in the realisation of their  astern ambitions.   A check has been put on their Baghdad bthemes: in the Caucasus they will find an alternative.    They have already secured to themselves the control of the Danube, which gives them access to the Black Sea: the acquisition of the Caucasus will take them a stage further to the shores of the Caspian: it is on the high road to Turkestan a region where the Germans are said to be endeavouring to find compensation for the failure of their MeaCpotamlan dreams.   Such friction a&amp; this policy might cause in their relations with their Turkish allies oould probablj? be smoothed away with German gold: anyhow it is improbablil that the (taeumft would let such considerations stand in their way.General Staff,^Yar Office,8.$.18.
