[TlifrBo^cament is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government, jPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1918.secret.I CIRCULATE to the War Cabinet the text of the agreement reached in Paris this week for the constitution and scope of the Inter-Allied Munitions Council.The British proposals were unanimously adopted practically in their entirety by the Conference. It will be seen that the location of the most important Committees, e.g., Steel and Nitrates, will be in London.The organisation is a considerable advance on any we have yet achieved in thisfield.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.June 8, 1918.MEMORANDUM ON THE ORGANISATION OF THE INTER-ALLIEDMUNITIONS COUNCIL.Text modified after views exchanged at the Meeting of the Inter-AUied Conference onJune 4, 1918. &apos;Scope.I. THE Inter-Allied Munitions Council is an authoritative body whose personnel and sources of information are such as to enable it to study, criticise, and make proposals in connection with munitions programmes. Its deliberations should cover the following four main topics : (a.) The basis of the military equipment of the army, which is capable of being modified by the study of Allied experiences ; this is particularly the case with Allies which have recently entered ino the war, and whose programmes are still in the formative stage.(6.) The adoption of the most suitable types in the Allied armoury in accordance with Allied experience.(c.) Specialisation of the various Allies on particular classes of output.(d.) Allocation and transport of raw materials for munitions to the various Allied countries.*Co-ordination of Existing Bodies.2. There is a second important duty to be carried out by the Council. A considerable number of Inter-Allied organisations have grown up, some with executive and some with advisory powers. It is necessary to co-ordinate the work of all such specialised organisations concerned with munitions, and their lines of policy be&apos; approved by the Inter-Allied MimitioDs Council. Those organisations and any further committees whose formation appears desirable should be subordinated to the main Inter-Allied Munitions Council, broadly speaking, in accordance with the annexed scheme.Sub-Committees.&apos; S. As regards the sub-committees indicated in the said scheme, it was agreed at the Paris Conference in November 1917 that a Technical Committee was required for the Inter-Allied discussions on technical questions concerning war material, whose duty it would be to ensure an exchange of information on inventions, experiments, and improvements, both in the realm of research and in that of production. This Committee will be composed for each Ally of one design and one production officer,. [525]
as it is undesirable to draw a sharp line between these two functions. This Committee should be in a position to centralise a great part of the detached liaison work which is going on between the several countries with regard to inventions, and the officers of the Munitions Departments as well as those from G.H.Q. who are dealing with these matters in Paris should report to this Committee. Experts may be added to the Committee as required for the examination of special questions. The Committee would be advisory only, the authorities responsible for design in each Allied country retaining their entire responsibility for the types adopted in each army.The Aircraft Committee, which already exists, will report to the main Council.The Chemical Committee is also in. the same position.No Committee yet exists on explosives, but it is necessary to create one to deal both with questions of allocation (on which there are very important questions outstanding on the extent to which we should supply Italy with high explosives and the extent to which America should be prepared to supply the European Allies with propellent in 1919) and with the use of economical mixtures. The Nitrate Executive should be subordinate to this Committee, but would continue to meet in London where its executive work is centred.There is at present no definite Non-Ferrous Committee, but constant meetings are taking place, and it is desirable that these should be put on an organised basis with subsidiary executives dealing with particular metals where required.As regards steel, at present there are arrangements in existence between particular Allies for the allocation of pig-iron and steel of various kinds. But these questions are not at present discussed as a whole. It is clearly desirable that the allocation of American and English steel resources should be considered by the main Council; but, apart from the general duty of the Secretariat to provide information on this subject, it will be necessary for the problems arising in connection with steel to be dealt with by a separate Committee of the Council. This Committee should have its headquarters in London.There remains the question of railway material. There is at Versailles an Inter-Allied organisation for dealing with railway transport. This organisation cannot be subordinated: to the Munitions Council, because transport is not with all the Allies a - matter for the Ministers of Munitions. But a liaison should be established between this Committee and the Munitions Council as regards railway material and raw materials therefor.. And in order to enable the Munitions Council to obtain an Inter-Allied opinion with regard: to the comparative urgency of the Allied demands for the supply of railway material when it has to make its final proposals for the allocation of steel, the Inter-Allied Committee on Transport should be invited to collect for the Munitions Council the total requirements of all the Allies, for railway material, wmether for civil or for military purposes, and to grade these programmes in their order of urgency.Constitution of Council.4. The main Council will meet every month or six weeks in Paris.It will consist of the Ministers of Munitions, except in the case of t,he United States, which will be represented by a specially accredited representative of the United States Government.The Ministers (and the American delegate) will be assisted by Two members for each Allied country, of whom one should, if possible, be in residence in ParisAnd, in addition (in cases where the respective Ministers of Munitions consider it desirable), by a representative of the War Department who will be a member of, or competent to speak on behalf of, the General Staff.The Council will have a permanent Secretariat, including a member appointed by each Ally. This Secretariat will be responsible for receiving reports from the various Committees, circulating periodical summaries or memoranda to the various Govern-ments, following up the decisions and resolutions of the Council, and reporting progress to the Council.The Inter-Allied Statistical Bureau will form part of the Secretariat of the Council.Between the plenary meetings of the Council referred to above,, it will be possible to summon, when necessary, smaller meetings of the members resident in Paris or o  delegates specially appointed for the purpose.
Reports.5. On matters appertaining to the Council, the Secretariat will summarise information brought periodically up to date, according to plan, and in accordance with what experience will have shown the Council to be most in need of.. With this end in view it will take as a starting point, other than the plan and general outline of the documents distributed by the Inter-Allied Statistical Bureau, the leading principles of the memorandum prepared by the Ministry of Munitions under the title of &quot; Review of Allied Munitions Programmes.&quot;It will make besides reports or special summaries on matters indicated by the Council.The Secretariat must obtain for the Inter-Allied Council on War Purchases and Finance and for the Inter-Allied Maritime Council all necessary documents concerning munitions and war material; in exchange it will receive all necessary information as to what course had been taken or proposed.Powers of the Council.6. As there is no precise definition of the powers of the respective Ministries of Munitions in each Allied country, it is agreed in principle that the powers of the Council will extend to all products having steel or other metals as a base, and to all chemical products, with the exception of such modifications as will have to be made to such a principle in order to take into account the varying conditions applicable to each country.
