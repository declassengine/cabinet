gAIjj   iYAOBP   0LAU3E j :   OOVEaiKtBBg   CO^ACTS, I, The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress Have . recently brought to the notice of th ; Minister of Labour a resolution adopted by the Congress on the subject of the administration of the Pair Yftigec Clauae in Government Contracts,    The Resolution raised a number of points on which it was thought desirable to obtain the advice of the Pair Wages Advisory Committee and a Report from that Committee has now been received (copy attached).I have considered that Report and the question generally and while it is not necessary, in my opinion, to adopt as a whole the suggestions put forward in the i&apos;iesolution. particularly at the present time when the pressure of work in the Contracting Departments is so abnormal, there are good reasons for adopting that part of the Resolution which stipulates that Government Contracts should not bo given to firms who do not pay &quot;fair&quot; ratos both on their private work and on their Government work.At present the operation of the flair Wages Clause is limited to the fulfilment of the partioular contract of which the Clause forms a part and it is provided that the contractor &quot;shall, in the execution of this contract, observe and fulfil the obligations upon contractors specified in the Hesolution passed by the House of Commons on 10th Karon 1909Host Contracting Departments before allowing firms to be placed upon their list of contractors enquire into the general &quot;fairness&quot; of the various firms but the Departments have no definite status in regard to any work except that concerned with the contract in question.    If in the oouree of investigating a complaint the Departments ascertain that the rates generally paid, or the conditions observed, on private work are so unsatisfactory as to constitute the firm a &quot;bad employer&quot; the Departments regard this as a   ground for removing the firm from the liat of contractors,   I although n  course no action oould be taken for breach of the Pair Wages Clause.It appears desirable that the position,of the Contracting Departments should be strengthened in this respect and that it Should be an instruction to then that firms should bo removed from the list of approved contractors if they have been shown not to be T? air&quot; employers in regard to both their Government work and their private work,I propose, therefore, If the Jfor Cabinetjjonottr, to put forward and support an amendment of the Pair Wages TfGsoTutTon oo as to ensure this result.The terms in which I would propose to put the amendment would b$ as follows:-&quot;thatrtin the opinion of the House, with a view to carrying out the objects of the Fair Wages Resolution of the House of Commons of 10th March 1909, the Government Contracting Depart-ments should exclude from the list of approved contractors firms which have been shown to the satisfaction of the Depart-ments concerned not to observe the principles of the Beaolution as regards rates of wages or hours of labour in respect of either Government work or privato work,&quot;(Signod) Goo, H* Roberts,10.6,10.
FAIR WAGES ADVISORY COMMITTEE.Report on certain Questions submitted by the Minister of Labour for the consideration of the Fair WagesAdvisory Committee.In December, 1917, the Fair Wages Advisory Committee received from the Minister of Labour the Memorandum shown in Appendix A., dealing with certain points that had been brought before the Minister by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress.The Fair Wages Advisory Committee met to consider the Ministers Memorandum on December 12th, and subsequently the members of the Committee, on behalf of their respective Departments, prepared memoranda dealing with the various points that had been raised.   The Committee now present their Report as follows : (1) Clause 1 of the Resolution submitted by the Parliamentary Committee.&quot; That all Government Departments shall supply to all authorised Trade Unions a list of firms invited to tender.&quot;Prior to the war it was the practice of most of the Departments to publish monthly, in the &quot; Labour Gazette,&quot; lists of the names and addresses of contractors whose tenders had been accepted. Owing to war conditions it has been necessary, for military and other reasons, for some Departments to discontinue this practice temporarily. In normal times, however, these lists are available, and afford means whereby the representative Trade Unions can ascertain to which firms Government contracts have been issued.The Committee are of opinion that it would be impracticable for the various Departments to supply to all Trade Unions every time an invitation to tender was issued a list of firms invited. It will be obvious that the clerical labour involved in such a procedure would be enormous; many of the Departments enter into contracts for very large numbers of articles and the aggregate number of firms who tender is very large. Many of these firms have not &apos;held, and may never hold, a contract. Moreover, in the case of many contracts it is undesirable, for reasons of public policy, that the names of firms tendering for a particular piece of work should be known to anyone but the officials of the Department concerned.The Committee understand that each of the various Departments is prepared to answer enquiries from &quot;the Trade Unions as to whether a particular firm are on its list or hold a contract from it at the time.&apos;It is the practice of some Departments to furnish annually to the Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress a list of firms to whom invitations to tender are issued by the Department, revisions of the list being notified at intervals. It would appear that this practice would reasonably meet the request contained in the Congress Resolution, and the Fair Wages Advisory Committee are of opinion that if the Departments who do not at present adopt the practice are requested by the Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee to do so they should supply him annually with the names of the firms who are invited by the Depart-ment to tender. The list could be classified under groups of trades.&apos; In some Departments, however, the compilation of such a list would impose an immense burden on the clerical staff and under war conditions it would be impossible to ensure its accuracy.(2) Clause 2 of the Resolution (first portion).(a) &quot; That no firm proved to be paying less than the Trade Union rate of wages to all its employees in any of its establishments, or not observing the working conditions general in the trade or calling, or agreed on with employers in all its establishments, shall be allowed to tender.&quot;(6) &quot; The question of the action which should be taken by the Contracting Departments in respect of firms who, while they may pay &apos; fair &apos; wrages for work done upon Government Contracts, are alleged not to be paying &apos; fair &apos; rates on their private work.&quot;x  (33)5034  Pk51   100  3/18  E&amp;S
.. ..-1-1It is the practice of most of the Contracting Departments to enquire into the general &quot;fairness&quot; of firms before they are allowed to tender for contracts or before contracts are issued, and firms whose labour conditions are regarded as unsatisfactory are not allowed to tender. Again, before firms are placed upon the list of contractors to the Department they are required by the Departments to sign an undertaking to observe strictly the terms of the Fair Wages Resolution of the House of Commons. The Fair Wages Clause is, in terms, limited to the fulfilment of the particular con-tract, and the Departments have no definite status in regard to any work except that concerned with the contract in question,.but in practice the Departments would view with severe disfavour firms who endeavoured to evade the spirit of the Fair Wages Clause by paying low rates on their private work. If in the course of investigating a complaint it appeared that the rates generally paid, or the conditions observed, on private work were so unsatisfactory as to constitute the firm a &quot;bad employer &quot; this would be regarded as a ground for removing the firm from the list of contractors, although, of course, no action could be taken for breach of the Fair Wages Clause.It would appear to be the business of the Trade Unions themselves to call attention to &quot;unfair&quot; firms if any are found to be among the list of contractors; the Departments, having made a careful preliminary enquiry, have been bound to assume that a firm is a &quot; fair &quot; firm until complaint is made and reasonably conclusive evidence furnished to the contrary.(3) Clause 2 of the Resolution (second portion).&quot;That where the bona fides of any firm to be considered a fair firm be challenged, the onus shall rest upon the Government Department concerned to bring together the Trade Union and contractor^ representatives to allow of both sides stating their case directly to the heads of such Department.&quot;It is the practice of the larger contracting Departments, when investigating complaints, to bring together, in suitable cases, the representatives of the firm and of the Trade Union concerned. Some Departments, lacking the necessary staff, have &apos; found it from time to time more satisfactory, in the event of dispute, to utilise the Board of Trade (now Ministry of Labour). The matter is one in regard to which practice must necessarily vary according to the particular circumstances of each case, and for this reason the Committee feel unable to recommend any definite instruction to the Departments; they think, however, that where the circumstances of the case require it the Departments should as a matter of administration bring together the representatives of the Trade Union and the representatives of the contractor, with a view to ascertaining from both sides the facts of the case.(4) Clause 3 of the Resolution.- &quot;That contractors shall furnish to the several Departments names and addresses of all sub-contractors, the same to be supplied to all authorised Trade Unions and published in the &apos; Board of Trade Journal.&apos; Contractors failing to supply such information shall be struck off the list of firms allowed to tender.&quot;This proposal raises the difficult question of what is a &quot; sub-contractor.&quot; In cases where it is known that an important portion of a contract (e.g., boilers or gene-rating plant for a machinery contract), cannot be executed by the main contractor, , but must be entrusted to a &quot;specialist&quot; firm, the contractor is usually required before acceptance to submit the names of his proposed sub-contractors for approval; and in such cases there would be no difficulty (subject to any objection on grounds of policy in a particular case) in publishing the names in the &quot;Labour Gazette &quot; in the same way as that of the main contractor, and the Committee are of opinion that, when the present abnormal conditions are at an end, the Departments should publish the names accordingly.But if the proposal were extended to the sub-contracting customary in the various trades (which is, generally speaking, the only kind of sub-contracting permitted), it would be found impracticable (a) to frame a satisfactory definition of a &quot; sub-contract &quot; for this purpose (would the term for instance cover the purchase of materials, such as yarn, cloth, leather, &amp;c, and of metal parts and components, such as fittings, nails, &amp;c. ?) and (6) to require (as would apparently be necessary if unsatisfac-tory firms were to be excluded) all main contractors to submit their propoped sub-con-tracts for approval before entering into them.   Moreover, there is no logical ground
for limiting the proposal to sub-contractors in the first degree; the same principle would apply to the sub-contractors of those sub-contractors, and so on indefinitely.It is, therefore, not considered possible to adopt this proposal as a general obligation.The terms of the Fair Wages Clause, however, make the contractor responsible for the observance of the clause by his sub contractors, and any complaint against a sub-contractor would be investigated by the Departments. In such a case the contractor would be required to enforce (so far as he was in a position to do so) observance of the clause by his sub-contractor; and the sub-contractor, if himself on the list of contractors, would be liable to disciplinary action in the same way as the main contractor.(5) Suggestion that Employers found not to have paid in accordance with the Fair Wages Clause should be liable to be sued by the workers for the amount underpaid during the whole contract period.Although from some points of view it might appear to be desirable that there should be a retrospective penalty upon employers who pay less than the &quot;fair&quot; rate of wages for work done under a Government contract, and even that the workers concerned should be able to sue for the difference between the rate paid and the rate shown to have been due, yet for the reasons given below the Committee are unable to recommend this as a practicable proposal. They apprehend, moreover, that legislation would be necessary to give effect to the suggestion, but this is a legal point on which they are not competent to advise.The Committee would point out that the proposal would involve the institution of a different method, and probably a special tribunal, for determining the approved rates. At present these rates are decided by the Departments to the best of their judgment after such investigation as is practicable, but it would often be difficult to establish to the satisfaction of a court of law that no other rates would comply with the Fair Wages Clause.The practical difficulties in connection with the enforcement of penalty clauses in relation to the Fair Wages Clause have already been the subject of consideration, and the Scottish Law Officers, to whom the question was referred in 1910, expressed the view that &quot;The difficulty of enforcing a forfeiture clause is obvious ... if the right of the Department to forfeit is contested who is to say what are the &apos; rates of wages, etc., commonly recognised,&apos; or who are the &apos;good employers,&apos; or whose practice is to be followed ? What constitutes a district ? What is the nearest district with corresponding industrial circumstances ? And finally, what are the &apos; conditions of employment&apos; which are to be taken into account? &quot; . -These questions appear to be to the point in the present case also. If it is assumed that a Department has decided that certain wages should be paid for future work under a certain contract, is the judicial tribunal to be obliged to accept the decision of the Department as conclusive for earlier work under the same contract? If not, it would have to answrer for itself, if it could, the questions referred to by the Scottish Law Officers. It might decide on a lower rate of wages than that fixed by the Department, and then the employer might turn round on the Department and claim from it the repayment of the excess wages paid upon its demand. Or the tribunal might decide upon a higher rate than that fixed by the Department, wThich might encourage workmen to be dissatisfied with other decisions of the Department and to take every case they could to the courts; and it might also tend to increase the prices in tenders. Again, different courts might give different decisions, and so embarrass the Department in its dealings with employers. If the tribunal, on the other hand, has to accept the decision of the Department, how far back in time would the decision be effective, and would the tribunal have to take into account any changes that had occurred in the interval in the wages position? And how if two Departments decided differently in similar cases ?It is practicable in normal times for the Contracting Departments to use considerable influence with contractors to induce them to pay up arrears that may be due when a complaint of under-payment has been established, at any rate from the date of complaint up to the date of adjudication, and in practice the Departments have been able to secure payment accordingly. It would not follow that the rates had been &quot;unfair&quot; throughout the whole of the contract, and the onus of raising a complaint of unfair rates seems to rest upon the worker. The difficulties of proving the rates which ought to be paid at the date of enquiry are often considerable, and they would be much increased if it had also to be ascertained at what date in the past those rates became the standard rates.
AIf a contractor is shown to have broken his contract by non-observance of the Fair Wages Clause the Departments can, and in practice do, debar him from tendering again ; and it is suggested that restitution of back wages due to workpeople on the particular contract concerned could be made one of the conditions of reinstatement on the list of contractors.1st March, 1918.G. E. ASK WITH (Chairman).ERNEST II. BRIGHT.GORDON CAMPBELL.W. R. CODLING.G. H. COLLIER.P. II. EZECHIEL.G. MORGAN.C. A. OLIVER.N. F. B. OSBORN.C. J. SPENCER.GEORGE A. STEVENSON.H. J. WILSON (Secretary).APPENDIX A.FAIR WAGES ADVISORY COMMITTEE.The points which the Minister of Labour desires to submit for the Consideration of the Fair Wages Advisory Committee are as follows : (1) The resolution put before the Minister on the 17th July by a deputation from the Parliamentary Committee by the Trades Union Congress (copy below).(2) A point arising out of the discussion which took place after that interview as to whether it would be practicable to meet the contention that after a complaint has been made and substantiated the penalty upon the employer is merely that for the remainder of the contract he is required to increase his wages to the fair rate. The Minister would like the views of the Committee upon the - proposition (based upon the Particulars Clause Section 116. (1) (b) of the Factory Act) that if an employer is found not to have paid in accordance with the Fair Wages Clause in the contract he should be liable to be sued in the civil Court by the workmen for the difference throughout the whole period of the contract between the rate paid and the rate shown to have been due, the latter rate being assumed to be the rate due to the workpeople as part of the Contract between the Contracting Departments and the employer, and between the employer and the workpeople.(3) The question of the action which should be taken by the Contracting Departments in respect of firms who, while they may pay &quot; fair &quot; wages for work done upon Government Contracts, are alleged not to be paying &quot; fair &quot; rates on their private work.Resolution submitted by Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress : &quot; That this Congress strongly protests against the manner in which the Fair Wages Resolution of the House of Commons has been administered,&apos; and instructs the Parliamentary Committee to endeavour to get the following conditions carried out by all Government Departments :&quot;(1) That all Government Departments shall supply to all authorised Trade Unions a list of firms invited to tender.&quot; (2) That no firm proved to be paying less than the Trade Union rate of wages to all its employees in any of its establishments, or not observing the working conditions general in the trade or calling, or agreed on with employers in all its establishments, shall be allowed to tender. That where the bona fides of any firm to be considered a fair firm he challenged, the onus shall rest upon the Government Department concerned to bring together the Trade Union and contractors representatives to allow of both sides stating their case directly to the heads of such Department.&quot; (3) That contractors shall furnish to the several Departments names and addresses of all sub-contractors, the same to be supplied to all authorised Trade Unions and published in the &apos; Board of Trade Journal.&apos; Contractors failing to supply such information shall be struck off the list of firms allowed to tender.&quot;
