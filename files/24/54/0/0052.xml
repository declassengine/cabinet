HJjT^Report for Week ending Wednesday, June 12, 1918.fhallgPART I.-ACTION TAKEN.In the House of Commons on Thursday, June 6, the Vote for the Salaries andExpenses of the Ministry of Food was agreed to in Committee with very generalexpressions of appreciation. A provisional summary of actual expenditure for the year ending March 31, 1918, shows the following results : ......  iSalaries, wages and allowances   -     ...... ,1- -  301,656Travelling expenses        -        -        .- -. . -    31,195 Incidental expenses        -        -                                 9,715Food economy propaganda         -  .     - - -    23,076Rationing expenses        -        -        - - -  177,583National ldtchens -   .     -        -        - ..- - -     1,025Subsidies for potatoes - - . - - - 249,381 Law charges       -                           -                          920Gross -        -        -        -        -  794,551 Less : Appropriations in Aid    -.       -        -     1,245Net expenditure        -        -&apos;       -  793,306Some further adjustment will be necessary in order to meet inter-departmental claims and expenses incurred by agents abroad.On Tuesday, June 11, Mr. Clynes presided at a luncheon given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the delegates of the Inter-Allied Scientific Food Commission. The French Ambassador was present. In welcoming the delegates Mr. Clynes stated that the appointment of the Commission showed a determination that the food policy of the Allies should be a common policy, and that even in the application of that policy within the different countries unity must be maintained. :The Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Clynes received a deputation of brewers who were anxious as to the effect upon their trade after the war of the proposed concentration of brewing. It was arranged that representatives should ascertain from the President of the Board of Trade the necessity for and extent of the changes involved.In the House of Lords the Earl of Crawford, on behalf of Viscount Rhondda, answered questions relating to privileges in Ireland and the proposed Government control of the wholesale milk trade.In view of the concurrence of the Advisory Committee of the Board of Agriculture &quot;in the proposal of the Agricultural Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Food to form a Joint Committee with Mr. Prothero as President, it has been decided to appoint a Sub-Committee : consisting of four members from each Committee to draw up a scheme for the constitution and powers of the amalgamated Committee.On Wednesday, June 12, the Consumers&apos; Council expressed themselves in favour .of a continuance of the supplementary ration for heavy workers, and passed a resolution advocating Government control of the production and distribution of agriculturalproduce.    . . ..,) ;    :.j f ;vn i -\.:;r: &apos;. -.   &apos; - Control of Supplies.Allied Requirements.-The following cablegram has been sent to Sir Guy Granet in reply to his message published in last week&apos;s Report&quot; Difficulty as regards settling bacon policy is that at present price our consumers cannot purchase even full amount of ration. Programme we should propose to end of year is to provide an 8-oz. ration which will require anA  (33)5875-2   Pk 1   130  6/18   E k S A
average including Army consumption of 55,000 tons a month which we should spread as follows : 	,   Bacon and Hams.	Lard.July	-  35,000	16,000August	- 35,000	16,000September -	-  35,000	16,000October	-  35,000	16,000November -	- .85,000	16,000December   -    t&apos;.	&apos; -   (    -  85,000	20,000	, 310,000	100,000but it is most important that we should secure lower prices. If prices are very much lower we could probably exceed this programme but even to reach this amount we ought to have a reduction to minimum compatible with Hoover&apos;s guarantee to farmers. We think the best plan would be for you to place orders for July and August 35,000 tons bacon and hams each month at lowest possible price you can arrange with Hoover, and then discuss the rest of the programme with us when you come over. If it is essential that you should place orders to the end of the year before leaving please cable at once as to possible reduction of price so that we can estimate amount. Hoover will realise that the present prices definitely limit consumption and we are not issuing at present the full amount represented by the purchasing value of the coupons available. We can however take frozen pigs in place of part of the meat demand.&quot; Our rationing policy from the 15th July onwards is as follows:  Meat     - &apos;   -     -     -     -     -  20ozs.Bacon   -     -     -     -     -     -    8,,Butter or margarine      -     -     -,   5 ,, . Lard     -     -     -     - 2 ,,&quot; Supplementary ration for manual workers up to 16 ozs. a week will probably be given in bacon.&quot; As regards lard our remarks as to price apply, but please use discretion as to whether the whole order of 16,000 tons a month up to and including December is placed at once or delayed.&quot;The difficulties experienced by the trade here in handling bacon cuts which have been recently arriving from America have been brought to Sir Guy Granets attention. He points out that it is impossible to arrange for United Kingdom requirements to be confined to the cuts normally imported except to the extent to which domestic consumption in the United States and Army and Continental exports absorb the other cuts.Sir Guy Granet&apos;s attention has. been drawn to the fact that cheese shipments have been recently very largely below expectations, especially in view of the large stock purchased.Bacon, Earns and Lard. Claims regarding the incidence of the loss incurred through tainted bacon have been numerous, though the total quantity&apos; of bacon involved has been small. Claims Committees are being set up in London and Liverpool, and the rules to govern their procedure have been formulated. They will begin work immediately.A settlement/has been reached in regard to the position of secondary wholesalers. They will obtain supplies from a &quot;pool&quot; of primary wholesalers, which will be treated by the Ministry of Food as an appointed importer.The Ministry of Food has allowed bacon and hams to be sold free of coupon in public eating places until further notice.Butter. A further purchase of 82 tons of butter at 44 and 44  cents per lb., f.a.s. in New York, has been made; 4,523 tons of butter arrived in. this country during the week ending June 8th, when the stocks in hand amounted to 21,500 tons, and the quantity on passage was 9,475 tons.On June 10th a distribution of butter was made, amounting to 25 per cent, of the applications from the trade for the month of June.
Cereals. It has been decided to abandon the compulsory use of maize in flour during the summer months. This should have the effect of making bread lighter and more palatable.The Wheat Commission are of opinion that to reduce the amount payable under the subsidy by permitting fluctuation in the price of bread would have the effect of nullifying the decision of the War Cabinet that the 4-lb. loaf should be sold at 9d. The present cost of the subsidy is estimated at 38,750,0001. and it is hoped to effect further economies.Cheese.-Advice has been received of a further shipment of 788 tons of cheese from Canada, making a total of 2,082 tons on the way; 915 tons have arrived in this country from Canada, and 1,383 tons from the United States of America, where the unshipped stock amounts to 4,797 tons, and 1,083 tons have already been shipped to this country.The Cheese (Distribution) Order, .1918, dated 7th June, 1918, gives the Food Controller power to prescribe forms of application for Government cheese, and to issue directions relating to its distribution.Cocoa. In consultation with the President of the Prize Court and the Admiralty Marshal, arrangements have been made for the sale of some 30,000 bags of raw cocoa held in prize pending adjudication. The President of the Prize Court has agreed to a sale being made only to persons approved by the Ministry.Coffee. The Admiralty Marshal has been consulted with regard to the heavy stocks of prize coffee at present in this country. The amount of coffee available for home consumption only amounts to about five months&apos; supply, whereas about sixteen months&apos; supply is held in prize. The Marshal has agreed to support this Ministry&apos;s claim that the prize coffee should be requisitioned. A scheme of distri-bution is being worked out in consultation with the Advisory Committee, and the Procurator-General has agreed to take the necessary action to bring the case before the President jof the Prize Court as soon as arrangements are complete.Dried Fruits. Delays in unloading the &quot;Adamantos Lemos&apos;-&apos; at Bristol have necessitated the postponement for a few days of the general distribution of dried fruits. , i&apos;The final settlements for currants and sultanas which were requisitioned by this Ministry at the end of last year have now been effected. The settlements show a saving of 24,000L on a total of 350,000L, which was approved for payment of the claims.Meetings have taken place with the Greek Minister and the Greek Minister for Agriculture (who is at present in this country) on the subject of the importation of currants. As a result the Ministry has agreed to a scheme of insurance, both marine and war risks, for all currants shipped to the United Kingdom. The proposal has been cabled to Greece, and as soon as M. Venizelos&apos; approval has been secured the scheme will be put into operation. It is hoped that the proposal will result in considerable shipments of currants by the Greeks on neutral steamers.Fish. The Pickled Herrings Order, 1918, dated 3rd June 1918, is substituted for the Pickled Herrings Order, 1917, the principal alteration being a new schedule increasing the maximum prices.The Fish Distribution Scheme is being worked out in detail. Divisional Food Commissioners in certain areas have been requested to appoint Fish Distribution Officers for the areas in which Advisory Committees are at present established, and appointments have already been made for London (Billingsgate), Leeds (Hull), and Nottingham (Grimsby).Fully constituted Advisory Committees at Aberdeen, North Shields, Hull, Grimsby, . Milford Haven, and Fleetwood have working schemes of allocation of all fish landed at... their ports, and the results have been satisfactory to the trade. Further Committees will be constituted as necessity demands.. *-Fruit-An Order dated 7th June 1918 amends the Gooseberries (Sales) (England and Wales) Order, 1918, extending it to the whole of the United Kingdom.Meat. Conditions as to the consumption and supply of meat are practically unchanged; the demand for frozen meat has diminished slightly, which would appear, to indicate that the dry weather is causing rather larger supplies of live stock to enter, the markets ; the stocks of meat remain at a very satisfactory level, and there is no cause for anxiety us to supplies in the immediate future, especially as home-grown stock will soon be coming . freely into the markets. The system, of inspection which has been established has not entirely prevented complaints as to theA 2
quality and condition of some of the meat received by the trade, but the meat arriving &quot;in this country is now of appreciably better quality.Milk.--The proposals put forward by Major Astor&apos;s Committee for the Control of the Wholesale Milk Trade have been considered by the Consumers&apos; Council, arid by the Agricultural Advisory Committee, and have received the approval of both bodies.A return has been obtained showing the quantity of milk sold to the-public during the week-ending 26th January 19.18. The total, sales for the whole of Great Britain amounted to eight million gallons for the week in question. . The quantity per head of population varied as follows :--England -        -        - &quot;1&apos; 704 gallons.Wales ,- . ; - - - - -784 ,, Scotland -    .   -        -        -        -   I &quot;616    ,,Great Britain   -        -        -  1640- The largest sale per head occurred in the London Division where the average amount sold was 2&apos;208 gallons, the smallest occurred in the Cardiff Division with an average of &apos; 624 gallons.&quot; The average quantity of milk sold per retailer in Great Britain.was 173 gallons.The Milk (Summer Prices) Amendment Order, 1918, dated 8 June, provides that after June 9, till further notice, the maximum prices for milk under the Milk (Summer Prices) Order shall b3 increased by id. per gallon. Where the maximum price has been varied by a Food Control Committee under sanction, the price so varied, shall be increased by Ad. a gallon.: The Food Controller may cancel or modify any contract for the sale of milk subsisting on the 9th June, and the buyer has the option of determining the contract.Potatoes.-The Potatoes (Distribution) Order No. 2, 1918, dated 6th June 1918, prohibits, except under licence, the consignment of any potatoes of the 1917 crop from Scotland to any part of England or Wales, other than Northumberland or Durham, and provides that no one shall buy or take delivery of such potatoes except from a person licensed.Tea. Mr. Clynes received a deputation from the Grocers&apos; Federation to discuss the extra allocation of tea to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, the desirability of rationing, and the datum period system of distribution in regard to its effect in preventing the creation of new retail businesses.   ,. A conference was held with London, Liverpool, and Manchester wharfingers to arrange uniform warehousing rates.   A tentative arrangement was made.; Wholesalers whose trade in the datum period exceeded 8,000,000 lbs. sent a deputation to Mr. Clynes complaining of the recent reduction of their rebate. .\; ; Organised Distribution.;&apos;..,^ddit?&apos;onaZ iSwppZies;-Arrangements-have been made to meet the . demands for additional supplies for fruit pickers in the Wisbech district, and also for. a Flax Pickers&apos; Camp in Essex.Fish. There are complaints at Plymouth, Falmouth, Penzance and St. Ives of the scarcity, and of the high prices of fish for local consumption.Rationing.has been decided that the existing restriction upon transfers from one retailer to another should be somewhat relaxed during the period immediately prior to the introduction of the National Rationing Scheme. Accordingly, application for transfer made during the week ending Saturday, July 6th, will, if supported by reasonable grounds, be more readily considered than at ordinary times. In particular a customer will be entitled to receive the necessary permission from his Committee upon his satisfying them that lie desires to return to the retailer from whom he used regularly to buy the rationed article in question, before rationing began. &apos;The question of the rationing of tea, cheese, and jam, in connection with the National Rationing Scheme is still under consideration.Supplementary Rations. The opinions of representative Food Committees have been taken on the question of continuing this Supplementary Rationing Scheme after 13th July. 320 Committees have reported in favour of a continuance, 98 in favour of return to a flat rate, while 13 are undecided,   ------ &apos;
Ft is worth noting that 18 of the Committees who favour the retention of the scheme desire the list to be revised to the exclusion of a number of the lighter trades.It has been decided to extend this ration to boys over 18 who have not been rejected, exempted, or called to the Colours, and the necessary forms are in preparation.The privilege of the weekly seamen&apos;s scale has been extended to certain other classes, such as fishermen, who are absent from home for five months consecutively.The Commissioner for the South Western Division was surprised on a recent visit to the mining centre of Redruth to find that large numbers of the miners had not troubled to avail themselves of their Supplementary Rationing Cards.Enforcement of Orders.The total amount of fines inflicted by the Courts of Summary Jurisdiction for the period from the 1st of January to the 1st of June, 1918, for offences under the Food Controllers Orders is 47,792 . 12s. 6cZ. The number of prosecutions for the past week is 910, of which 830 resulted in convictions. The percentage of success-91 is, therefore, practically the same as in the previous week.There is an increase, on last week, in the average fine imposed, of 6s. 9d for England, Scotland and Wales, and in Ireland an increase of 2s. Id.The Divisions sending in the greatest number of cases are:- &apos; ;r ;Cases.

His defence was that he was drunk. The second case was T. Brown, who was sentenced at Deptford to one months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour, for giving short measure of milk on his rounds.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports. .Imports of principal foods and feeding-stuffs in the week ended June 8th were at a satisfactory level, though lower than in the preceding week (Table A)- The total, including rice and tea, 226,500 tons, was 13,200 tons above the figure for the corre-sponding week of last year. Wheat and flour at 94,500 tons, represented slightly more than one wee.k&apos;s current consumption, and in equivalent grain showed a falTon the previous week&apos;s receipts of 56,900 tons. Arrivals of other cereals, taken together, were somewhat heavier than in the previous week. Of maize, only 6,200 tons, was received. Importations of oats were&apos; unusually heavy ; the total, 23,800 tons, has not been exceeded in any week since September last. The aggregate for all cereals, including wheat, was .150,600 tons against 172,900 tons in the corresponding week of 1917. &apos;     -   &apos;&quot;ilAiliA &apos;i
Although meat Jell 8,200 tons,on the week, mainly owing to, heavy declines in &quot;consignments oi mutton and meat unenumerated, arrivals were higher than a year ago by 2,200 tons.   Bacon and hams increased from 12,500 tons to 23,500 tons.Both butter and lard were received in much larger quantities than in the previous week ; since the commencement of the year the total amount of fats (butter, margarine and lard) that has been received has been 124,000 tons, or 54,600 tons less than in the corresponding period of last year.Imports of sugar at 26,500 tons were much better than in the two previous weeks and were above the average for the previous weeks of the year.Importations of oilseeds, nuts and kernels during May totalled 96,700 tons as against 124,800 tons during April. As against May, 1917, there was, an increase of 13,200 tons. Arrivals for the first live months of 1918 were only 5 per cent, less than in the first five months of 1917. During this period, however, arrivals of oilseed cake have been in all but 4,700 tons compared with the corresponding figure of 104,100 tons for last year. &quot;lConsumption.Meat. From the exceptionally low figure for the week ended May 25th, the supply of home-fed meat at the four markets included in Table B fell a further 18 per cent, during the week ended June 1st. An increase of 35 percent, in imported supplies raised the aggregate, home and foreign meat taken together, 18 per cent, above the figures of the previous week. The total was only 3 per cent, less than a year ago ; not since the commencement of the year has the deficiency on 1917 been so small. The weekly average for May was 7 per cent, below that for April, and 22 per cent, below that for May 1917.At the Centra] London Markets for the week ended June 8th there was again a decrease of 18 per cent, in the quantity of home-killed meat marketed. Imported supplies also declined on the week but by little more than -5 per cent. The aggregate was 20 per .cent. lower than in the corresponding week of last year.The number of cattle and sheep stalled at markets in England and Wales (Table 0) fell still further during the week ended June 1st. The decrease on the week before was 16 per cent, for cattle and 2 per cent, for sheep. For the week ended June 8th the decline on the corresponding week of 1917 was 63 per cent/in the case of cattle and 58 per cent, in the case of sheep.Flour. Consumption of flour by the principal biscuit manufacturers for the four weeks ended May 25th was in the aggregate the same as for the previous four weeks. Owing to a marked decline in Government contracts, the total is 9,200 sacks less than in the corresponding period a year ago.Stocks have fallen during the month. *-Biscuit Makers1 Return.Consumption,		1   Stock.              ,	4 weeks ended :  May 26th, 1917 April 27th, 1918 May 25th, 1918	Sacks. 136,700 127,500 127,500	April 27th, 1918   -     -May 25th, 1918    -     -	Sucks. 46,700 44,800Fish. The total quantity of fish arriving at Billingsgate Market during the week ended June 8th was 2,247 tons, a decrease of 6 per cent, on the week before. Compared with the corresponding week of 1917, supplies were 4 per cent, heavier.Milk. The milk index (Table E.) rose 4  points to 113 in the week ended June 1st.Stocks.Stocks of cereals on June 1st (Table G) were, in the, aggregate higher than a month before. In wheat the increase amounted to 144,000,tons. Seasonalmpyements in barley and oats have lowered the stocks of these commodities, butrinot to any &quot;unanticipated extent.

This increase must be distinguished from an increase in the average or working class expenditure on food in which account has to be taken of the substitution of articles that are relatively plentiful for those which are scarce and for a reduction in the dietary. It should be remembered that special measures have been taken in certain important cases, such as bread and potatoes, to reduce price and to prevent a rise. The index showing the alteration in the expenditure on food for a working class family is as follows : 1914-July    -	... -  1001917-July 1st	-  1641918 January 1st    -	-  154February 1st   -	-  154March 1st	- 145April 1st        -.....-	-  144May 1st	- 141June 1st        -        -	- 150Compared with a year ago the improvement in the wheat position has been well maintained during May., -Other cereals taken together, are also, higher than on June 1st, 1917, but here the increase is not nearly so marked.The outstanding feature in other stocks is the increase in bacon and hams from 30,100 tons to 61,800 tons, a figure well above that for a year ago. Butcher&apos;s meat has fallen slightly, hut the total 98,000 tons compares favourably with 55,100 tons the corresponding figure for last year. The only articles in which stocks&apos;on June 1st were below anticipations are cheese, and butter and margarine. The deficiency in cheese is due to lower imports, that in butter and margarine to the; reduced home production of the latter. On June 1st, butter, margarine, and lard 1 totalled in all 30,500 tons against 56,500 tons a year before.Sugar has fallen from 287,000 tons to 271,000 tons. A. much heavier fall had been expected but was avoided by larger importations.Prices.Wholesale. The only important change in wholesale prices during the week ended June 8th was a fall of 2s. 6d. per cwt. in the price of English Cheddar cheese from 178s. to 175s. H.Retail. The retail price of potatoes rose 9 per cent, during May and that of eggs 6 per cent. The price of potatoes was on June 1st 38 per cent, less than a year ago. There was a marked fall amounting to 10 per cent, on the month in the price of fish following the coming into operation of the new schedule of maximum prices on May 27th. Other prices were nearly the same, but it is noticeable that a fall of 3 per cent, in the price of milk brought down the price on June 1st to a level just below that of June 1st, 1917.On the basis of current consumption the general movement of retail prices taking the level in July 1914 as 100, during recent months is estimated as follows :-
