With reference to the British Military Representative&apos;s letter No. 12/L/3, dated 6th June, the C.I.G.S. wishes strongly to endorse the request made by General Sackville ?st that the situation with regard to the Allied defensive policy in the Balkan theatre should be put on a more satisfactory footing.

Sir Henry Wilson hopes that the action suggested will be taken by the War Cabinet forthwith.

The Secretary,

War Cabinet.

I forward the attached paper as I regard the state of affairs in the Balkan theatre as being thoroughly unsatisfactory and as needing immediate stops to be taken to put an end to the long delays on the part of General Guillaumat in complying with the orders which he received in December last.

The





     
The matter is doubly urgent as in present conditions any offensive operations by the enemy would probably lead to 4 British divisions being shut up in the Salonika defences where they will have to stand a seige, and in doing so will be at the mercy of those Greek troops who will form a very large portion of the garrison of the place. Any lack of loyalty or determination on the part of the Greeks will load to the inevitable surrender or annihilation of the 4 British divisions.

Joint Note No.4 has now been passed by the Supreme War Council and we can insist on the immediate compliance with its requirements by General Guillaumat and thus eliminate a very needless danger which, for reasons which have never been stated, has been allowed to exist during the past 6 months, during which General Foch&apos;s instructions have been ignored.

I would like to bring this question before the Military Representatives at a very early date and my position would be greatly strengthened if I received a letter from the Secretary, War Cabinet, asking for the views of the Military Representatives as to the adequacy of the plans which General Guillaumat was instructed in December last to forward.

1.        Please see the attaohe^notetroirtretieral.-0uillaumatt&quot;5-plans by Major Currie.The whole situation in regard to these plans seems thoroughly unsatisfactory, in fact it would seem that some ulterior motive must lie behind this continual equivocation.The three salient features which require elucidationare : -(1) Y/hat steps are being taken to form subsidiary bases.(2) In the event of a retirement becoming necessary, and Salonika having to be. evacuated how it is proposed to supply all the Allied Divisions.(3) How are the Divisions Bast of the Vardar to be brought to Old Greece.The setting up of an Inter-Allied control of railways and bases would appear essential.2. A British General has now been&apos; sent to the Balkansto report inn the feasibility of withdrawing either French or British troops, or both.   He also received special instructions to find out what action has been taken to comply with the requirements of Joint Note 4 in the following respects(a) The defence of Old Greece and all its harbours and possible submarine bases in the event of it becoming necessary to abandon Salonika,(b) Defenoe of Old Greece.(c) The time worn topic of the transfer of the 35th Italian Division.He is accompanied by a French General, but what actualinstructions the latter has received are unknown.3. As it appears possible that even now the BritishGeneral may be unable to obtain General Guillaumafs actualplans, if such exist, and as much delay may still occur, I amof opinion that further steps should be taken to obtain theanswers to 1, (l), (2) and (3.) which are of urgent Importance.A.

DIARY OP GEJJffRATg SUILLAUMAT&apos;3 PLAN.Uth December191.7* Tb.v ivt: tractions issued by General JFooh top General (Hullauraat, dated December 16th, I91V, onGeneral Foohre the latter&apos;s assumption of the command of theInstructions to Allied forces in Macedonia, began as follows:-IJeneral Guillaumailated 16th Deo. (l)*?he Allied Armies of the East^ placed .jinder the, command of General ^uillaumat, will have as their base not only SALONIKA but the whole of Greece&quot;,(2)Tho mission of the Allied Armies ia Firstly:-To prevent the enemy from conquering Greece.   With this object they have in the first plaoe to maintain the integrity of the conquered country from the sea to the Albanian Lakes, whilst keeping contact as far as possible with the Italian troops in the VA10NA region.Secondly;-&quot;&quot;^&apos;n&quot;&apos;&quot; Xn the case of the Allied forces being obliged to yield ground it will be their duty to continue to deny the enemy all access to Greece, particularly to tho region E. of the PlNDUS, while keeping possession as long as possible of the entrenched c camp at SALONIKA and combining their action with the Italian forces at VALONA.These instructions clearly implied -that the defence of old Greece is the primary mission of the SALONIKA force, while retention of SALONIKA itself, although desirable, may prove to be impossible, and consequently that the preparation of new lines of communication based on old Greece should be studied.19th December,1917.       On December 19th, 1917, the MilitaryRepresentatives, after further oonsideration ofJoint Note No.4.      the Balkan question, submitted the followingpreaosaltj;-The Military Representatives recognise that it is desirable from every point of view to cover Greece while holding  on to both /Salonika
Salonika and Valona. But if the forces now at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief in the Balkans are not sufficient for this purpose, the Military Representatives are of opinion that it is essential to deny to the enemy the mainland of Greece, with all its harbour and possible submarine bases, and in this case it might be necessary to abandon Salonika and possibly also to lose touch with the Italian 35th Division who might be compelled to fall back on Valona. In any case the Permanent Military Representatives think it necessary that this Division should be placed on the extreme left of the Army on the Salonika front.

The Military Representatives have acquainted themselves with the instructions given to the new Commander-in-Chief at Salonika.  They agree with the general sen?e of them, and they request that he should be asked for his plans based on the instructions he has received. These plans must include, in particular, his arrangements for re-basing himself on Greece and not only on Salonika and for the evacuation of Salonika, should such evacuation be necessary in order to make sure of denying Greece to the enemy.

? Note No. 12.

? January, 1918.

In Joint Note No.12 the Military Representatives contemplate having to give ground in the Balkans, but express their opinion that there will be no great danger in this, if preparations are made in good time for the occupation of shorter and stronger-lines covering Greece and if it is possible SALONIKA also.

?th MARCH, 1918.

?eral Guillaumat&apos;s ?tline plan date ?th February, ?ceived British ?tion 19th March.

On the 19th March some notes (dated by General Guillaumat 28th Feburary) which at the time did duty for a plan, together with a copy of a telegram of criticisms sent by General Foch to General Guillaumat (dated 9th March) were received from French Section. In this paper General Guillaumat stated that he had to provide for the double necessity of covering old Greece and of safeguarding the stores at SALONIKA. As there was no mention by General Guillaumat in the plan of any intention of moving the stores from SALONIKA or of finding for himself any base other than that town, it was clear that his double necessity included the retention of SALONIKA. From the paper it was seen that General Guillaumat had mistaken his orders.

(2)   The betterment or establishment of railway communications from Greece to the Macedonian front. (3)   To announce the approximate date on which these bases and communications will be ready for operation If need be.This decision lays partieular stress on the necessity for preparing new bases and communications and also of the advisability, implied though not expressed in the instructions given to General^1 llaumat, of preparing plans for an eventual evacuation of SALQJ L A*Iprll 1918 * On the 20th April the French Section forwardedfurther Instructions given by General Gui^laumat to his ?a.l GuillaumatfsArmy Commanders on the subject of the establishment of ructions to Armythe Balkan plan of defence, aiders datecfI March,received The orders issued by General Guillaumat tosh Section      his Army Commanders, dated 13th March, begin :-I April.&apos; &quot;For the plan of defence of the Army of theOrient there is a two-fold rolej firstly, to cover old Greece, and secondly not to abandon to the enemy the Important supplies accumulated at the base at SALONIKA.Here again those orders which apparently assign equal importance to the defence of aid Greece and&apos; the defence of SALONIKA are hardly consistent with the orders received by General Guillaumat.This plan of General Guillaumat*s leaves many I important points unexplained.Forv. example : -(a)     The difficulty of supply.On :v 3 -

To sum up,&apos; General Guillaumat1 s plans havenot yet been disclosed to us in adequate detail.   So far as their scope is known to us, they appear to present oertain disadvantages.    It is therefore advisable, especially in view of the fact that the safety of 4 British Divisions is concerned, that the French Government should be urged to furnish us with the required information without delay.    The French Government should be clearly given to understand that we are thoroughly dissatisfied with the conduot of affairs in the Balkans.(Signed)   P.J.R. GURRIB.Major.. A35th. June, TOT.
