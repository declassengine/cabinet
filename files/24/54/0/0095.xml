CONFIDENTIAL. [June 15,1918. jcument is the Property;of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Political Intelligence Department, Foreiun Office,Germany /007.MEMORANDUMonA &quot; PEACE OFFENSIVE &quot; IN THE GERMAN PRESS.DURING the last fortnight a series of articles have appeared in die German press in which the question has been discussed whether it is desirable that the German Government should start what they themselves call a &quot; Peace Offensive.&quot; In view of the very close control which the Government exercises over the press, and the way in which it is deliberately used to influence public opinion and to prepare the way for official action, this discussion seems to merit serious attention. It may also be brought into connection with the rumours which have appeared in the Dutch press that the Germans are proposing to use the Conference at The Hague as an opportunity for putting forward some form of peace overture. Moreover, the discussion in the German press has produced an echo in the French press, which is also worth notice.1 The discussion began with an article which appeared on the 31st May in the &quot; Kreuzzeitung.&quot; The article was not an editorial but contributed by a correspondent.* The &quot; Kreuzzeitung &quot; is of course the organ of the Prussian Junkers, and the paper which is most highly read among the higher ranks of officers in the German army. It may be taken as probable that, before being published, it had been submitted either to Ludendorff or to someone in his confidence.The article begins by demanding a German &quot; Peace Offensive,&quot; to be conducted by the Imperial Government with every method of public agitation for the purpose of making an impression upon the enemy nations, and encouraging among them a wise appreciation of the futility of prolonging the war. It differs from previous public or private German initiatives in the same direction in that it openly calls itself a &quot;Peace Offensive,&quot; and indeed employs the still stronger German word &quot; Vorstoss,&quot; the military term for an attack or thrust. This &quot;Peace Offensive&quot; is not to be regarded as on the same plane as former &quot; evil-reputed and miserably unsuccessful offers of peace.&quot; Its object is to invite the publication in concrete form of the main demands of Germany in order that the whole debate between the belligerent nations regarding war aims may be lifted &quot;from the sphere of boundless demagogy on to the lines of business-like discussion.&quot;The writer thinks that if the course he recommends were adopted the whole world would be in a position to convince itself &quot; that the acknowledgment of the German demands would not destroy the basis of the existence of any of the enemy nations.&quot; &quot;It seems certain,&quot; he says, &quot;that our arguments would find support in the public opinion of the neutral nations, which would increase the effect. The weight of the facts of the military situation dispels any apprehension lest the initiation of a &apos;peace offensive&apos; might weaken our political position. The need of peace has become international. It is a favourable moment for securing by a cool but keen fight (&apos; scharfen Karnpf &apos;) for peace all the advantages of the first move (( der Vorhand&apos;).&quot;The article proceeds : -&quot; The most recent speeches of English statesmen, with their assertion that they do not know our demands but are always ready to examine serious overtures, challenge us to this fight (for peace), and the anxiety which the enemy press has manifested in discussing the alleged German &apos; peace offensive&apos; strengthens our belief in its success. It would amount to a strengthening of our position if by the publication of our most essential war aims enemy statesmen were deprived of the trump card of German ambiguity and. together with their press, were compelled to discuss our demands in a practical sense. Only those persons whose conception of things is primitive and is still swayed by the notions of antiquated* The initials i: L.H.&quot; are affixed to the article; we have no means of conjecturing what name these-initials represent.[367-211 B
political methods could maintain that by publishing our war aims we should be throwing our cards on the table and therefore sacrificing the advantages of liberty in diplomatic negotiations. Such a view argues an entire misconception of the political imponderabilia peculiar to this war, which are to be discovered by the most alert attention to the public opinion of the whole world that is politically concerned. This public opinion, with its subtle reaction to all the vicissitudes and possibilities of this war, has become a kind of jury of the world (&apos; Weltforum &apos;), the formation of whose mental attitude must yield even to the victor advantages which we must not fail to secure. He who is not cognisant of this important task is no statesmen, and he who does not rise to its performance is not equal to the conduct ot policy and is too puny for the dimensions of this war. The statesmen who has seized the opportunity of arguing down (&apos;geistig nieder-kampfen&apos;) all objections against his own main demands before the negotiations begin has strengthened his own freedom for negotiation. He, on the other hand, who suddenly brings forward unexpected, demands at the conference table exposes himself to the danger of considerably stronger opposition, must count upon their being seriously delayed and hampered, and may have to take upon himself the whole odium of the negotiations being broken off. It is further evident that any of these consequences involves dangers for public feeling among the statesman&apos;s own nation. If public opinion has not been attuned to the demands of its own Government, it will only with difficulty be able to bear the consequences. It will more easily succumb to the arguments of enemy statesmen, and will not forthwith be inclined to give its Government the necessary backing. The enemy and the neutral press will increase these vacillations. The course of the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk has already supplied an important lesson in this regard.&quot;The writer goes on to suggest that in the new &quot; peace offensive &quot; only the main German demands should be put forward, but that they should be formulated in concrete terms so that the main details can be easily grasped, and be accompanied by a statement of the grounds on which they are based. His mind is evidently influenced by a strong desire to lead German opinion into the right paths. He points out that the variety and the divisions of that opinion &quot; are very creditable to the constructive abilities of the politicians who deal in War Aims, but have led to a perilous disintegra-tion of domestic unanimity which makes the Governments want of a programme doubly culpable.&quot; Neither German public opinion nor the German Government has a clear programme. The nation must know where it is going, and the Government must be urged to show the. way. Incidentally, he says, the mysterious and perilous circulation of stories about dissensions between those who are in the highest command of the Army and those who conduct the affairs of the Kmpire, and the suspicious way in which, questions regarding their respective competence are watched originate in this uncertainty as to their programme. The unity of the two factors is necessary, that is to say, the work of both must be regarded as of equal importance. It would not be difficult, he thinks, to bring German public opinion to a state of universal and conscious resoluteness in support of the demands which have to be enforced upon England.As to the nature of these demands, he says : &quot; The formulation of these demands is easy, and their legitimacy will be patent if they are worked out on the necessary bases of that undisturbed existence in the future to -which we have a right, and are not deduced from the results of military action at .any given time. It would be still worse if they were to be influenced by vacillating consideration for the trickeries (&apos; Jongleurkunststucke &apos;) of enemy phraseology. The consideration of our own advantage forbids us to set up any demands except those which are necessitated by the securing of our own vital interests and the expeditious obliteration of the damage inflicted by war. We cannot live isolated after the war, for our field of activity is the world ; and we therefore want an understanding which will do justice to our demands. Any one who refuses us these demands wants to ruin Germany, for he is destroying the foundations of Germany&apos;s existence.&quot;By that curious contradiction which pervades German political writing, German statesmen are exhorted to follow the example of English statesmen who manage to reach the public ear. In Germany, it is pointed out, anything that has hitherto been done by way of appeal to the public has been of a purely departmental character. Statesmen, owing to their want of a programme, have been afraid of saying too much,
and the result has been speeches without anything solid in them. The singular suggestion is made that there should be attached to the Imperial Chancellor a political economist, a colonial expert, a representative of the army and another of the navy, an international jurist, and an historian under the leadership of a specially qualified diplomatist. Their task would be to workout this business as a &quot; peace offensive&quot; very much as Germany has been in habit of working out questions of social policy. Summing up, the writer concludes : *&quot; The preliminary work must be rapidly completed, and the political offensive can then begin. It must be a &apos; peace offensive,&apos; not overtures for peace. Some-thing must be done, and time presses. This is precisely the moment, for our military successes will increase the effect. Be who would let the sword alone speak takes too narrow a view of the scope of this war and has no appreciation of tbe political demands which it involves.&quot;2. The article at once evoked a considerable amount of comment, principally in the Radical and Socialist press, which always views with legitimate suspicion any initiative from reactionary quarters. These replies show that those differences of opinion with regard to the peace terms to be imposed by Germany, which have existed throughout the war, still exist almost as strongly as ever, and that any discussion of peace terms in Germany at once evokes a bitter discussion between the rival parties. The articles in the Liberal and, Socialist press are in addition instructive, because they show the effect which, the recent military successes have had upon even the more moderate opinion in Germany.The first comment is that of the Radical &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung,&quot; which is one of the most useful instruments of the German Foreign Office in virtue of the way in which it cloaks aggressive foreign policy in the mantle of German Liberalism.The &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; says : &quot; If the writer of the article was really concerned to get nearer peace he ought to have sought allies in the majority of the Reichstag (to which majority the whole &apos; Kreuz zeitung&apos; party is bitterly opposed). To judge, however, by many turns of expression in the article, it appears to be doubtful whether the writer is not rather thinking of a &apos; peace offensive&apos; in the sense which was recently characterised by Lord Robert Cecil than trying to find the shortest way to peace.&quot;The Socialist &quot; Vorwarts &quot; emphatically approves of any &quot; peace offensive,&quot; but has some scathing comments to make upon the proposals of the &quot; Kreuzzeitimg,&quot; both as regards their origin and their content.   It says : &quot; When one reads this it sounds, at least in part, quite acceptable, but we know well enough from actual experience what is meant when our Pan-Germans talk about &apos; the foundations of our existence.&apos; These include, according to Pan-German ideas (quite apart from the tremendous war indemnity which is openly and directly demanded as an official claim by the &apos; Kreuzzeitung &apos;), the Longwy and Briey iron and coal fields, the Flanders coast, the colonisation of land in the West and East, and a dozen other frontier safeguards&apos; of all sorts, not to mention a colonial, empire in Africa, &amp;c. The &apos; Kreuzzeitung&apos;s &apos; demand, therefore, really amounts to utilising the favourable moment of the advancing offensive to tie the German Government permanently to its annexation programme. Nevertheless, we take up the &apos; Kreuzzeitung&apos;s &apos; call. We, too, demand from the Government a peace offensive. We, too, demand from the Government an immediate announce-- ment as to its concrete war aims, but we demand that these war aims shall sub-stantially correspond to the assurances solemnly given at the commencement of the war &apos; We are not animated by the lust of conquest.&apos; We demand that the war aims published by the Government shall be of such a nature that they can really forthwith lead to peace. That means that, whilst it is to be hoped that we shall finally convince our enemies by the military offensive in the West that all hopes of the overthrow, collapse, or internal decay of Germany are vain, a diplomatic offensive shall simultaneously convince them that they have no oppression, violence, or severance of national territory to expect from a victorious Germany.&quot; (&quot; Vorwarts,&quot; 1st June, Mo. 148.)
In the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; (morning edition, 3rd June, No. 278) the editor, Theodore Wolff, writing as usual with some of the Jewish sarcasm of ileinrioh Heine, observes : &quot; Some few days ago the &apos; Kreuzzeitung&apos; invited the German Government to undertake a &apos; peace offensive,&apos; and frankly to declare its conditions of peace. One can pretty accurately imagine what the newspaper organ of the Conservative politicians who believe in a policy of might conceive that these conditions should be. There is no surer means of once more embarrassing those parties and classes in France and England who desire peace and of rallying everyone to the battle flag than to expound annexationist or &quot;similar demands and to do what the &apos; Kreuzzeitung&apos; wants. The rest of us, quite independently of everything that is f happening in the held, reject all oppression, annexation, and guardianship of foreign peoples, and we continue to believe as decidedly as ever that this tremendous struggle can only end by a free understanding. We do not want ever-rnightier armaments to become inevitable; we do not want every possibility of advantageous intercourse and of a new and better policy in the east and the west to be cut off for future generations as they have been for us on the east and on the west. Acquisitions of territory involving the incorporation ol foreign nationalities, and likewise artificial foundations of new States and partitions of the world, do not appear to us to be any adequate compensation.&quot;3. The &quot; German ia &quot; (the organ of the Catholic Centre, Hertiing&apos;s own party) notes, with its customary air of judicial impartiality, that the &quot;Kreuzzeitung&quot; and the &quot;&quot;Vorwarts &quot; agree in demanding a public statement of Germany&apos;s war aims, and that they only differ as to what these war aims should be., &quot; It is easy to see how great in such a proceeding would be the danger of domestic dissension, and a spectacle of dissension is the last thing that we ought to offer to our enemies at a moment when our strong fist is giving them such a lesson that there is really nothing left for them except to yield, if they indeed want to get out of this bloody struggle. Our enemies have often enough been told that they can always count upon our genuine desire for an honourable peace.&quot;&quot; Germania&quot; then goes on to put the question whether it would be better tactics to take the first step, and whether the move ought to be in the sense of the &quot; Kreuz-zeitung&apos;s &quot; article or in that of the &quot; Vorwarts.&quot; It does not profess to answer this question, but emphasises its importance, which is perhaps &quot;decisive.&quot; In any case, &quot; Germania &quot; thinks, there ought first to be as complete an understanding on the subject between the Reichstag and the Government, and the Government will doubtless keep in close touch with the Higher Command. Previous experience has shown how little impression is made by one-sided declarations. A declaration by the Government backed by a mere minority of the Reichstag would . be as ineffective as a resolution of the Reichstag which was only half-heartedly approved by the Government. That steady co-operation, that sense of solidarity which is true &quot; parliamentarism &quot; and which ought to be the fairest fruit of this war for Germany, ought to be preserved. (&quot; Germania,&quot; 2nd June, morning edition, No. 278, p. 3.)4. In a later article (3rd June, evening edition, No. 152), the &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; begins by some fencing with the old organ of undiluted Prussianism, and taunts it with doing the very thing which it characterised as &quot; high treason &quot; in the Radical press, namely, proposing a public statement of German war aims. Indeed, the arguments which the Junker organ employs are in part identical with those of the Radicals, only the Radicals employed them in favour of proclaiming Germany&apos;s readiness to give back Belgium and to restore it.The &quot; Frankfurter&quot; continues : &quot; One cannot be quite certain, it is true, that the object of this peace offensive is to bring about peace as quickly as possible, or if it is only intended to support by agitation the military conduct of the war. Lord Robert Cecil recently gave a meaning to the words &apos; peace offensive&apos; which made them signify not an offer of peace, but an instrument for waging war. There is much in the &apos; Kreuzzeitung&apos;s&apos; articles which suggests similar reflections.&quot;Among these aspects of the articles is the insistence upon the necessity that those who conduct the political affairs of the country should support the military chiefs ; the
suggestion that the recent speeches of British Ministers should be answered by a counter-move ; and finally, a remarkable phrase about &quot; dislike of the very appropriate Machiavellian treatment of the ideas of mankind which move the world.&quot; Such trains of ideas, the &quot; Frankfurter&quot; thinks, are not likely to commend this &quot;peace offensive &quot; to the favourable attention of enemy statesmen.The &quot; Frankfurter &quot; proceeds to give its own ideas of a &quot;peace offensive,&quot; and is obtuse enough to insult England by suggesting that she will ultimately have to come to terms with Germany, like Austria after 1866 and 1870. Starting from the admission of the writer in the Junker journal that there must ultimately be an understanding because Germany cannot live in isolation, her field being the world, the &quot; Frankfurter &quot; proceeds: &quot; The problem of the relations of Germany with England is thus rightly stated. Two Powers like these can neither annihilate each other, nor eliminate each other, nor &apos; cut&apos; each other. The end of it all, whether it comes sooner or later, whether it comes immediately after the close of this war or some years after it, as was the case with our relationship loith Austria, will have to be a sensible compromise, leaving both Powers their rights, and the possibility of unfolding their resources, and making it feasible for them to live together after the war. Here, surely, there is no sacrifice of German interests; it is, on the contrary, one of the most imperious necessities for Germany and the surest pledge of Germany&apos;s future to eliminate by a compromise one of the greatest perils by which that future is assailed.&quot;If the suggested &quot; peace offensive &quot; is to produce the desired impression upon the neutrals and upon England it must, the &quot;Frankfurter &quot; urges, be carefully calculated in regard to the demands which it advances.   In this connection &quot; It is merely hinted for the present (by the writer in the &apos; Kreuzzeitung&apos;) that the problem does, not lie in the coast of Flanders alone, for the value of that coast is relative ; but that it lies in the freedom of the seas in war and in peace, in questions of world, economics (spheres of interest, the open door, supply of raw materials), and in the colonial settlement. Whether the relative value of the Flanders coast is so understood as to be compatible with the relinquishment of Belgium is not yet stated. But, all the same, it is noteworthy that a newspaper of that colour should make such an admission, and that the question of the Flanders coast should be relegated to a secondary place by comparison with the much more important problems of our economic life, freedom of communications, and the settlement of the colonies.&quot;The Frankfurter &quot; admits that the number of people in England who have entertained the idea of an understanding has hitherto been small. The Government and the great majority in Parliament have, in agreement with England&apos;s allies, &quot; till now adopted an attitude wdiich is only intelligible so long as the Entente thinks that it can impose peace like a yoke upon our necks.&quot; (That, it may be remarked, was the way in which Germany imposed peace upon France in 1871 and upon Russia in 1918.) The &quot; Frankfurter &quot; itself has more than once admitted that the spectacle of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaties and of the way in which they have been interpreted or broken by Germany was not calculated to encourage the Western belligerents to entertain or to initiate peace overtures, even if their military position were as unfavourable as the &quot; Frankfurter.&quot; in the passage about to be quoted, seems to think.The article concludes : &quot; Whether Lloyd George, Lord Curzon, Clemenceau, Briand, and Sonnino still think this (i.e., that they can impose peace like a yoke upon Germany) is, perhaps, not going to be so very important. The victory oj Germany stands before the whole world so far beyond any doubt that it cannot be challenged by any failure to recognise it on the part of a few deluded statesmen. It will help to sweep them away just as it helped to bring about the fall of Tsarism. If an announcement of the German demands should have the effect of demonstrating to neutral and enemy countries the justice of our cause and the futility of prolonging the war, the change of attitude would come all the quicker. Once it has been recognised by the Entente, and above all in England, that there is no appeal against the verdict of the world&apos;s history, there, too, people will be ready, sooner or later, to make a sensible settlement with Germany. It will be our business to propose [367-21] C
Gterms which render possible an understanding not at any price, but at a price which gives us what we need. The glorious victories of the German arms will help to bring about on the other side the readiness which is now lacking to agree to such an understanding .&quot;*5. In a further article the &quot; Kreuzzeitung &quot; itself calls the pack to heel by reminding the rest of the German press that its original article was not editorial but was the work of a collaborator. It declares that it does not agree that the time has come for a new peace offensive, but that, when it comes to announcing war aims, the form chosen must be such that no doubt can exist among Germany&apos;s enemies as to her consciousness of her strength. The &quot; Kreuzzeitung &quot; appears, in fact, to have realised that it would be useless to commit the Government without first securing the support of a majority in the Reichstag. The first thing to be done would be to reverse the July Resolution : &quot; It might well be of decisive importance for Germany&apos;s future if the Reichstag majority, or sections of it, could be convinced that the Peace Resolution of July 1917 is an anachronism (sic). If * Herr Erzberger, for his part, really wants to revive the Resolution, his action would be welcome in so far as it would then perhaps be made clear whether there is really still a majority in favour of that official product. The question raised by one of our contributors as to whether the enemy ought now to be confronted with a declaration of concrete war aims would then certainly enter into the framework of the debate.&quot;The matter apparently is disposed of, for the present at any rate, by an epilogue in the &quot; Kreuzzeitung &quot; from its contributor (issue of the 5th June), who says : &quot; The freedom of the seas in war by the abolition of the right of capture at sea, of blockade, and contraband; the retention of the Flemish coasts is unnecessary provided that England gives up Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, and Singapore, and reduces her naval armaments to the scale required for m?.rii.!iue police, and further gives guarantees against any economic discrimination against Germany, and reparation for the damage done to Germany&apos;s world-trade by illegal measures, provides for German participation in international commissions of control for all spheres of economic interest in lieu of an actual war indemnity, and secures a consolidated colonial empire for Germany.&quot;The editors of the newspaper once more express their disagreement with their correspondent regarding the present advisability of a &quot; peace offensive,&quot; and wind up the discussion in the following terms : -&quot; We shall have lost the war in the political sense if it does not establish a constellation which checkmates England and America, does not detach Japan from them, and does not open a land bridge to the Far East over Asia.&quot; (&quot; Daily Review of the Foreign Press,&quot; June 12, 191.3, p. 332.)(). We have also an important telegram to the &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; from Stein, the veteran Berlin correspondent of that paper. Tie points out that the Socialist &quot; Vonyarts &quot; had already detected the real object of the move, which was &quot;to seize the moment when a military offensive was in progress in order to commit the German Government once for all to a policy of annexation.&quot; &quot; It will be seen that when the &apos; Kreuzzeitung&apos; talks of a peace offensive and of coming to an understanding, there is no idea of a renewal of the famous Peace Resolution of the Reichstag; on the contrary.&quot;   (&quot; Frankfurter Zeitung,&quot; 4th June, second morning edition, No. 153.)Stein is probably right. The object of the original article was probably not overtures to the enemy but an attempt to secure a fairly unanimous declaration of far-reaching war aims. The military successes which have been gained might make it appear that this was a good opportunity, and it may have seemed to the military party that it would be well to strike while the iron was hot, and formulate once for all certain annexationist and other strong projects, thus binding politicians to this programme. Some members of the Catholic Centre, and even some Radicals such as Miiller-Meiningen, have already announced projects of this nature, and even the Majority Socialists have declared that the military results are more powerful than ideas such as the self-determination of nationalities. The moment, therefore, seemed favourable for consolidating Crerman public opinion.* The italics throughout are those of the writer of this report.
OAs for the Western Allies, they were, doubtless, presumed to be too anxiously concerned about the tide of battle to be capable of discussing in advance the details of a pan-German programme. Incidentally, the prospect of such a programme might help to depress them and make them more inclined to give way. German political psychology is quite equal to making a mistake of this kind.We may sum up the discussion by saying that, so far as German public opinion is concerned (at least so far as public expression of such opinion is permitted by tbe Government), it is on one side wedded to the annexationist views of the &quot; Kreuzzeitung &quot; ; on the other side we have the ideas represented by the &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung,&quot; which looks forward to a compromise which will assign to England as regards Germany the position of Austria after 18b&apos;G and .1871, that is a position in which friendly relations were renewed, England, in fact, accepting the position that she has been defeated by Germany. Either view is, of course, equally unacceptable in this country. The German masses seem to be divided between stolid and helpless resignation and the belief that tbe continuation of German sanguinary offensives furnishes the only hope of attaining the peace which is so desperately desired before Germany is totally exhausted and ruined.It ought to be remarked that in the whole German discussion there does not appear to have been one word said about the prospective effect of America&apos;s interven-tion, or about the views of America on a &quot; German compromise.&quot;7. A French comment on tbe whole of this controversy is worth noticing. M. Gauvain, in the &quot;Journal des Debat^ &quot; (8th June, 1918, No. 157), regards it, in all its phases, as a symphony played by the Berlin Foreign Office, the performers being carefully concealed. It is really in his view a trap for the Allies with the object of representing them as intransigent and averse from the discussion of the most reasonable terms of peace. The way to deal with it, in his opinion, is to accept any reasonable discussion of terms, provided that the discussion be public and that all the Allies (or their press) take part in it with an identical programme. It is in successes and separate conversations with the different Allied Powers that the danger lurks. In a later article M. Gauvain defends himself against criticism ; he disclaims all idea of a detailed statement of territorial and Allied aims, but strongly maintains his original contention that the object of the German Government is to throw the moral responsibility for the continuance of the war upon the Allies and to create dissensions among them, and that the best means of meeting this is by a serious and sober state-ment by the Allied Governments.&quot;We have constantly protested against the procedure of politicians, whether invested with responsibility or not, who, on paper, divided up Europe and the world. Every time that we have pressed the Allied Governments publicly to put out their programme we have had-in view only the general conditions. Unfortu-nately, every time that the Allies believe that they ought to publish a declaration, they have fallen into the mistake which they ought to have avoided. They have made incomplete catalogues. In this manner they have unnecessarily given nourishment to German polemics and caused discontent among those people who were passed over in silence. On the other side, they have often expressed them-selves as journalists rather than as statesmen ; balanced oratorical phrases swelled out with epithets. One of the peculiarities of this war is that ministers speak as publicists and army leaders as diplomatists.   Let each stick to his trade.&quot; What we expect from the Allied Governments is that they should put in sober style, without literary effects, the general political situation resolving from the war. This document must be neither an inventory nor a catalogue of claims. It must state frankly the great questions of principle, on the solution of which depends the regulation of particular questions. The Central Powers have adopted the opposite system ;  they have only talked to us of particular questions.Principles embarrass them.   That is natural.....&quot;(&quot; Journal des Debats,&quot; June 10, 1918, No. 159.)
