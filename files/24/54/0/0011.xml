CENSORSHIP OF ILLUSTRATED TECHNICAL PAPERS.(Obeervat i o ng &quot;by Pre a b Bur e au ^ o   .Wa j)f flee Memo ran dumWith reference to the Memorandum by the War Office on the censorship of illustrated technical papers, a copy of which has been received from the War Cabinet, the Directors of the Official press Bureau submit the following observations:--Two questions appear to be involved in the Memorandum; Pirst the institution by an indirect method of compulsory censorship in the case of &quot;technical and scientific&quot; publications; and second, the question of the machinery to be adopted for&apos;submission in case the former question is decided in the affirmative.1.   With regard to the first question, the definition of tech-nical and scientific matter will require great care if the new Regulation is to be made tolerable to the newspapers.   Are all Military articles technical ?2.   If compulsory censorship is to be enforced in the case of a particular class of matter, it is very important that the method adopted should be simple and expeditious, for in cases of newspaper publication time is of the essence of the matter.Hitherto the Official Press Bureau has been the one authority for announcing Government decisions as to what may or may not be published.   All the principal papers now keep repre-sentatives in constant attendance night and&apos; day at the Press Bureau in order to facilitate the speedy submission of matter. Under the scheme now proposed Editors would have to submit matter to two distinct authorities - &quot;technical&quot; matter to the proposed Conjoint Board and other matter to the Official Press Bureau. There might well be differences of opinion as to the category to which particular matter belonged and conflicting decisions might result.   Records of all newspaper articles, photographs, and books submitted for censorship are kept at this Office.   Under the new system it would be necessary for this office to refer to the Conjoint Board and similarly for the Conjoint Board to refer to this office if uniformity was to be maintained,   serious delay would result.- With     reference to the last paragraph but one in the Memorandum by the Y/ar Office, it may be pointed out that the only sure way of preventing valuable information from reaching the enemy is to prevent its publication in the first instance, and this is a matter which pertains to the functions of the pres-s Bureau.It is therefore suggested that if the Conjoint Board is established, it should act as an. advisory committee to the Press ^Ureau, and that the compulsory submission of any matter affected by the new regulations should be, as in the case of all other press matter, to the Official Press Bureau.   We attach a copy x of the Home Office letter on the subject.Circulated. (Signed)   P.W. SHIESTTEKHAM.&quot; E.T. COOK.Press Bureau. Directors.10th June, 1913.
