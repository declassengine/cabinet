\VJii 5 athe Property of,tv**5 Government.)Colonel W, Dally Jones, 296-.:    p.,pn r .e t :-19th Juno, 1913,In accordance with Cabinet authority, and ray Memorandum of the 29th May,&apos; 1918, the quostion of the leakage of Haval information and its publication in tho &quot;&quot;veiling Standard&quot; has been further gone into, and tho statements demanded of tho newspaper Editor and corro-spondont under the authority of Defence of tho Realm Regulation 53 have boon obtained.   Tho attached momoranduri shows what has boon elucidated.It appears perfectly clear that there has boon a leakage of three itorb of information -(a) Tho fact that 5 submarines wore sunk during one week;(b) Tho fact that cruiser submarines had been in actionand sunk, and(c) That a transport had rammed and sunk a submarine.Tho statement of tho newspaper correspondent,  -Mr, Woodbridge, that ho got the information about the cruiser submarines on tho evening of the l^th May by letter which ho believes came from Floetwood, is almost as positively incorrect as any statement of that kind could   -- bo, as the information could not possibly have reached this Country sooner than wo received it except by a wirelesscame to him   from a conversation in a train, whereas it is admitted by the &quot;high official&quot; with whom he talked that this information was given to him in conversation, so that Mr, Woodbridge1s recollection appears to bo rather at fault.I do not know whether the Cabinet will wish to take any further action against the nowspaper.   In view of tho way in which they obtained the information I am of the opinion that it would bo sufficient if I asked the Editor to come and see mo, when I would put the matter before him in as clear a light as possible.As regards tho gentleman        r - who informed the newspaper correspondent of these occurrences, I fool sure that it was merely in tho way of conversation with a friend, and that ho had no idea that the information would bo published, and that now that he realises the serious nature frojx an Operational point of view of such information getting out, it will never occur again so far as ho is coneornod.What I am most e one erne d about, however, is that in spite of all the headings of &quot;-Secret&quot; and &quot;Confidential&quot;n documents which are of nc abinot and/^tLnistors, and izon Cnatureofnecessity circulated to the in spite of the confidentialors discussed with them, there is stillperiodical leakageIt is very difficult to bring thisleakage....
leakage houo, and Bomotibaos when wo could brin^ it hono tho nioro demands of secrecy make it inoossiblo^o do oo. In thin case I would invite tho Cabinet to ,-rJvo tho widest possible circulation to a iiinuto sonoWat on tho linos or tho following suggested draft&quot;The \7ar Cabinet considered a Report iron the &quot;Admiralty representing that certain information - which, &quot;so far as can bo ascertained, could only have got out through Reports to tho VAar Cabinet or by confidential &quot;papers issued to tho Y/ar Cabinet - had appeared in &quot;the Press.     The Adriiralty served notices upon the &quot;Editor of the newspaper, and thereafter upon the &quot;correspondent , requiring thorn under Defence of the &quot;Realm Regulation 53 to disclose tho oouree of the &quot;information.-   Prom this it is clear that at any &quot;rate part of the information was cormiWiicatod to the 1Press by an Official having direct access to con-&quot;fidontial Cabinet documents in which this information &quot;would appear, and while it is beyond doubt that the &quot;information was communicated in all innocence to a &quot;friend, that friend used it for newspaper publication,&quot;The War Cabinet wish to Impress upon their &quot;colleagues the absolute necessity for ensuring by all &quot;means the inviolate secrecy of documents issued to the &quot;Cabinet and to Ministers, and of the secret &quot;information given at the Cabinet, and they suggest &quot;that. Ministers should personally caution such members &quot;of their staff as must of necessity handle   these &quot;documents for filing and other purposes, and as far &quot;as possible liinit tho number of these who see the &quot;documents.   The Cabinet are satisfied that in this &quot;case actual disadvantages in the waging of tho 8submarine war have been incurred by tip violation of JIsecrecy, and feel sure that with this warning the &quot;patriotism of all concerned will be the only incentive &quot;needed to prevent valuable info relation being given &quot;to the enemy&quot;.In Naval warfare even more than in Military warfare, the functions of the Intelligence Department include not merely the receipt of aeearate information, but also the :Ussemination of information at the time when, and in the precise form in which, we wish it to reach the Enemy, &quot; If confidence and secrecy are violated this very valuable weapon is taken from us, and I hope &apos; that the&quot;Cabinet will see their way to condemn this leakage in the most positive terms,(Sd.) ERIC GEDDES.10.6.18.
Memorandum embodying results of Admiralty investigation as regards unauthorised pub-lication of Naval information in feeriinr Standard&quot; on 15th May.In accordance with the directions of the War Cabinet the Admiralty have made further enquiries in regard to the unauthorised publication of Naval information in the &quot;Evening . Standard35 on the 15th May,It will be remembered that this paragraph contained the statement that &quot;in a recent week no fewer than 5 ,UI Boats are defir^taly known to have been sunk.    These 5 included two of the/large submarines from which the German Admiralty and people expected so much,&quot;In the course of their investigations the Admiralty have obtained formal statements from Mr. Mann (Editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;) and Mr, A.W,Woodb ridge (an occasional contributor to the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;) from whom Mr. Mann stated that he had. obtained his information.    Voluntary statements were also made to the Director of Public Prosecu-tions and to the Admiralty by a high official, who furnished part of the information to Mr. Wooabridge,Mr, Mann further produced the original M,S, of the paragraph9 which shewed that, as first written,it included a further piece of information as follows:-&quot;One recent exploit greatly interested the American soldiers on a large troopship bound for this side, for they saw one of their escorting vessels - a British ship, handled with consummate skill - crash right through a big submarine, cutting it in halves, and then in the cusLomary British way salving all the German crew who had not been killed by the ramming,&quot;This sentence was omitted by the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; as not suitable for publication, but it is of importance as shewing that three pieces of Naval information were, without authority, communicated to the Editor,The result of the Admiralty enquiries may be summarised as follows:-Mr.. Maim (Editor of the &quot;Evening Standard)(1)   States that the information was obtained from a high Official who, according to his (the Editor Vs.) informant stated that there was no harm in the publication of such details,    The information, as originally submitted to hi included the statement that a German submarine had been rammed by one of the British warships convoying American transports.    This he deleted as unsuitable for publicati air offending against the regulation that nothing is to be published about the destruction cf any enemy submarine or the capture cf its crew,.(2)   States that the writer of the paragraph was Mr, A.W, Woodbridge.
Mr, Wo odbridge (ContribuApr JiclJi&amp;LIS&amp;^iilc Standard&quot;)(1)   States &quot;in course of conversation with X (an old personal friend), X told mo in answer to my questions as to how - we were faring in our anti-submarine campaign that wo were doing very well indeed.    As an example, we had sunk 5 in one week.     In view of the Prime Minister&apos;8 statement in the House that wo had sunk 5 in one day (specified) I did not consider there could be any impropriety in mentioning the 5 in one week incident, both&apos;the week, the area,&quot;and the circumstances being unspecifiedcn(2)   States that on the previous evening (i,e,, the 14th May) he had received a communication from a correspondent, he thinks from Flcwtwood, giving particulars of our methods of attacking submarines^ and&quot;claiming that we had recently sunk two of the new large German submarines,(5)   States that he heard the reaming of the German submarine described in a conversation between two persons unknown to him in a railway train between Beaconsfiold and London.The High Official(1)   Voluntarily informed the Director of Public Prosecutions that it was he who inadvertently had made the communication to Mr, Woodbridge without realising or intendng that the facts.would be published, and expressed his regret for what had happened,(2)   Voluntarily informed the Admiralty authorities that he had mentioned to Mr. Woodbridge the fact of 5 submarines having been sunk in one week, and also the fact of the ramming of the German submarine, but not the information as to the Submarine CruiserseIt will be seen from the above that the Admiralty investigations have not been successful in arriving at a clear and uncontradictory account of the matter, inasmuch as:-(A) The gentleman who imparted the information states that he did so, without realising or intending that it would be published.   .   Mfc, Mann, on the other hand, states that Mr. Woodbridge told him that the informant declared that there was no harm in the publication of such details,      Mr, Woodbridge makes no statementon this point.(B) Mr, Woodbridge states that he received the informationas to the submarine Cruisers in a communication from a correspondent on the evening be ore his conversation with X., i,et, the evening of the 14th, and that he thinks the letter came from Heetwood. It is to be observed that the incident in regard to the submarine cruisers only happened on Saturday, the 11th May,    The first information with regard to it only reached the Admiralty at 1,10 p,m. on Monday the 13th May, and it was kept the closest possible secret until, the fuller details having been received at 3 a,m. on tho morning of Wednesday, the   15th, it was communicated to the War Cabinet on that morning.    Yet Mr. Woodbridge. received the information in a letter on the evening of the 14th, which, if his recollectionis/
3.is correct, came from Fleetwood and must have been written not later than Monday, the 13th,Whatever my be the explanation of this, it was clearly mo3t reprehensible of Mr, Woodbridge and most unfair to the gentleman with whom he conversed on the 15th May. that the information as to the submarine cruisers,rocjived from an entirely different and unconnected source, should, without cause or justification,, have been worked into the paragraph as part of the statement in regard to the sinking of the 5 submarines in one wee1&apos;: which he obtained from that gentleman. He apparently had no shadow of ground for asserting that the 2 submarine cruisers were included in the 5 which that gentleman mentioned to him, yet he made this definite statement, which naturally suggested that he had obtained both pieces of infor-mation from the same source,(C) As regards the incident of the ramming of the submarine the gentleman alluded to stated that this was part of the infor-mat ion given by himself to Mr, Woodbridge,    Mr, Woodbridge, on the other hand, states that his only authority for the incident was a conversation between two strangers in the train between Beaeonsfield and London on a date not specified.
