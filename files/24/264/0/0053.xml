Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1936.SECEET.                                                         Copy  No..   ^4CP. 278 (36).CABINET.PREPARATIONS FOR THE  FIVE-POWER  CONFERENCE.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a statement comparing the viewsof the different Governments concerned, on the preparations for the Five-power conference.    2.   The vital difference seems to concern the  point dealt with in paragraph 5of the statement, i.e., the question whether  the non-aggression arrangements shallbe subject to exceptions, such, particularly, as those laid down in Article 2 of theTreaty of Locarno concerning action under the Covenant of the League of Nations.If there  are no exceptions at all, this would mean that no party subscribing tothe proposed non-aggression arrangements could  come to the assistance of a non-signatory Power  if attacked by a party  to those arrangements.   Thus, Francecould not in such  circumstances  assist  Russia, Czechoslovakia or Poland ifattacked by Germany, nor  could  Great  Britain on the assumption  that shebecame  a party  to  a non-aggression arrangement assist Egypt or  Iraq ifattacked by another party to  such an arrangement.   Further,  a State in  this position  could not go to the assistance of  a State attacked in violation of theCovenant.  This would be incompatible with our obligations under the Covenant.    3.   A  second difference concerns the question of the manner in which  adecision  is  to be reached as to whether a non-aggression undertaking  has beenviolated, i.e., is, or is not, the League of Nations to be the deciding body?   Wehave known since the 31st March that Germany would not accept the decision ofthe Council in this matter, for in their note of that date the German Governmentsuggested the constitution of an international court of  arbitration for the purpose.Now they seem to have abandoned  even this proposal and to be anxious to leavethe decision to  the parties to the  Treaty.   This proposal is  certainly just aspracticable as that of the court; but it is scarcely conceivable that we could agreeto the League Council being deposed in this fashion.    4.   Another  difficulty  is  likely  to  arise  owing to the  general German.reservation regarding the approach to an Eastern and Central European settle-ment.  The Germans maintain that the Western Treaty must be concluded beforeanything else can be discussed,  and  even then they  reserve their attitude  (seeparagraph 9 (1) of the statement).  There would probably be no obstacle to thecompletion  of the Western  Treaty first;  but    the  western negotiations were successful there must be no doubt that there will be a sequel.  At present Germanyseems to  be unwilling to admit, this.   Russia and France&apos;s clients of the LittleEntente would not allow her to conclude a purely Western Treaty if all  sequel toit were specifically ruled out.    5.   Three differences have developed on the question of guarantees (see para-graphs 4 and 7 of the statement).  The first concerns the guarantees for whichwe have  asked from France and Germany, supposing that Italy would requirethe same for  herself.   The French are prepared to  support our view;  but theGermans and Italians seem to be opposed to any extension of the guarantee system      8860  [13974]                       &apos;                         B
as it existed under the Locarno Treaty.  The Chiefs of Staff are being consulted;but there seems prima facie to be no reason why we should not have reciprocity,which would make the Treaty more acceptable at home.  &quot;We should not, therefore,abandon our request for guarantees  at least unless and until all&quot;the other pointsare reasonably settled.    6.  The second difference arising out of the question of guarantees concernsBelgium.   She is  now unwilling to  give any guarantees at ail, even to  France,though she promises &apos;&apos; scrupulous fidelity &apos;&apos; to her obligations under the Covenant.We do not want a guarantee from Belgium; but the French do.  If there were no guarantee from her, it would have to be clearly understood that Belgium, if sheonly undertook to defend her own  territory, would  not tacitly allow  foreignaircraft to cross her territory to  attack,  a third Power.  The Chiefs  of Staff arebeing consulted on the value of the Belgian guarantee to France.    7.  There is a further difference though not perhaps a serious one which seems likely to develop in respect of the guarantees (paragraph 4 of the statement).This arises out of the French suggestion that not only the metropolitan frontiers of the parties to the Treaty should be guaranteed, but also those of their possessionsand dependencies.  This might suggest  (an enquiry has already been addressedto the French Ambassador on the point) that the French would like to  see theTreaty extended to cover colonial possessions an additional  obligation for us and without any counter-advantage if we obtain no guarantee for ourselves.  Onthe other  hand, even if we did obtain a guarantee, the effect would be to  converta pact limited to  certain European  frontiers  of vital  importance to us into onewhich would involve  us  in  responsibilities in  parts of  the world of no  special importance to us.  Incidentally, this proposal would almost certainly be strongly opposed by  Germany and Italy,  the latter of whom would see in it an attemptto extend  the Treaty to the Mediterranean.  It is probable that the French couldbe brought to  drop this point without much difficulty.    8.  There is a difference between the French and Germans over  the questionof the demilitarised zone (paragraph 9 (2) of the statement).  It is, however, notbelieved that the  French would press seriously for the restriction of the. rightof fortification on the German side of the frontier; and it seems doubtful whetherthis point is really one  which,  with agreement reached on the other matters,would ultimately hold up the settlement.    9.  On one other point mentioned  in paragraph  9  of  the  statement  are serious difficulties to be anticipated;  and that concerns  the French proposal forstaff conversations. We are committed to these under  article VII of  the Text of proposals of the 19th March, 1936, provided they are open to all Five  Powers.                                                                    A. E.Foreign Office, October 23, 1936.
      STATEMENT, COMPARING  THE  VIEWS  OF THE  FIVE                            GOVERNMENTS.&apos;    ON the 18th Septembers 1936,  the  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairshanded to the French, Italian and Belgian Ambassadors and the German Charged&apos;Affaires a memorandum  regarding  the agenda of the  proposed Five-power conference,  enumerating certain points  which,  in  the  view of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment, might profitably be discussed  by the five Governments in advanceof  the meeting.  This memorandum  contained the general and provisional viewsof  His Majesty&apos;s Government on each of the points mentioned.    2.   The French Governments reply to this memorandum was received onthe 2nd October;  and the German Government&apos;s  reply on  the  14th October.The Italian Government replied on the 19th October, and the Belgian Governmenton the 23rd October.(A) Points proposed by  His Majesty&apos;s  Government for preliminary discussion.    3.   The  points which His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  suggested  might be&apos;discussed are as  follows :        (i) What is to be  the  form of the new agreement, i.e., will  it include          (a) non-aggression arrangements between certain Powers, and, if so,          between which  Powers;  and  (b)  provisions  guaranteeing  those          non-aggression arrangements; and, if so, which Powers will give and          receive &quot;guarantees ?     (ii) Shall the non-aggression arrangements be subject to certain  exceptions          as in  Article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno?    (iii) How shall a decision be reached as to whether the  non-aggression under-          taking has been violated %    (iv) Will it  be necessary to make special provision in the  new agreement for          air attack?     (v) Will the new agreement contain provisions  for arbitration and concilia-          tion as does the  Treaty of Locarno ?             (B)- Views of the Five Governments on these points.(i) What is to be the form of the new agreement?    4.   His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; assume that the new agreement will include certain non-aggression arrangements, whereby the participants would agree in no case to attack or  invade each other by land, sea or air, or to resort to war againsteach other.....   His Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready to guarantee the observance  of such arrangements as between  Germany, on the one hand, andFrance and Belgium, on the other, in return for similar guarantees for the UnitedKingdom from France against Germany and from Germany against France.&quot;    The French  Government &apos;&apos; consider that the provisions of the  Treaty of locarno should be maintained subject to the  inclusion of the modifications and additions rendered necessary by present circumstances or which experience seemsto  render desirable.  Just as the Treaty of Locarno is based upon a guarantee ofthe territorial status quo resulting from the frontiers between  Germany andBelgium and between Germany  and  France, and a guarantee of the inviolabilityof  these frontiers, the new agreement should be based upon  the recognition of thefact  that there does not  exist  between  the contracting parties any territorialdispute, and consequently,  in their mutual relations, upon an individual andcollective guarantee of the territorial status quo as well as of the inviolability ofthe frontiers  of  their possessions  and  dependencies.   Each signatory  would undertake vis-a-vis each of  the other signatories not to proceed to any attack or      [13974]                                                    B 2
invasion by land, sea or air,  and not to resort in any event to force.  . .  . .   Incase of  failure to  observe  the  obligation of non-aggression,  assistance  (theobligation  to render which must not be less extensive  than that resulting fromthe Treaty of Locarno) should be rendered by the other signatory Powers to thePower attacked.....  The French Government  wish to declare at once that,subject to reciprocity, they are ready to contract the obligations of guarantee and assistance  referred  to above towards each of  the Powers parties to the  new agreement.&quot;     The German Government,  &quot; as already proposed in their peace plan of the31st March last, regard obligations for non-aggression  between Germany, on theone hand, and Belgium and France, on the other, and the guaranteeing of these obligations  by Great Britain and Italy, as the essential  elements  of the Pact.The answer to the question whether these elements in  the treaty should  furtherbe  supplemented by non-aggression and guarantee obligations between othertreaty partners will have  to depend on whether such an extension of the systemof the Locarno Treaty is in the general interests of peace  and whether it can beintroduced without  upsetting the necessary balance of the treaty system.  TheGerman  Government will  only be able to form their final judgment on this point when they  have  learned the views of the other Governments concerned.&quot;     In the opinion of the Italian Government &quot; the new Pact should retain thefundamental principles of the  Treaty of  Locarno.   These principles consist in essence of :  (a) the specific undertaking of France,  Belgium and  Germany not tohave recourse to war in any question which may arise between them;  (b) the joint guarantee  by Italy and  England of  the non-aggression agreements  between france,  Belgium and Germany  which  form the  foundation  of  the locarno treaty.....The  Italian Government have gathered  that it is  the intention ofthe British  Government to introduce into the guarantee system a new principle:that of reciprocity.  It seems to emerge from the British memorandum that the-British Government would be ready to renew the Locarno guarantees, so far as concerns the non-aggression agreements between Germany, France and Belgium,in exchange for similar guarantees in favour of Great Britain on the part ofGermany against France  and on  the part of France  against Germany.  Thatwhich in the communique of  the 3rd February, 1935, was the principle on whichthe air pact was to be based would thus eome to be used as the organic foundation for the entire system of guarantees in the new Treaty.     This innovation seems  to  the Italian Government to be  of  the  greatest importance  and  the  Italian  Government would  wish to call the  attention of theBritish Government  to what would, in their opinion, be its practical consequences.To begin  with,  the Italian Government has  always regarded  the Locarnoguarantee as a joint Italo-British guarantee and has always considered that thereal strength of the  Locarno Treaty lay in the fact that the aggressor would inevery case have  found himself faced by the united forces of the  Power attacked and of the two guarantors.   The joint character of the Italo-British guarantee,and this union of the forces of the guarantors and the Power attacked, constitutedthe  fundamental unity-for all  practical  purposes-of  the Locarno  Treaty.Confronted with the  suggestions contained in the British memorandum,  theItalian Government  wonders  whether this fundamental  unity would be effectivelymaintained in a regime of reciprocal separate guarantees, or whether the Treatyof Locarno would not become  split into two tripartite systems, which- wouldfundamentally alter the  position of the  guarantors,  do  away  with the jointcharacter of the guarantee and, for all practical purposes, transform the locarno treaty into.two  separate Pacts  of mutual assistance : one Franco-Anglo-Germanand one Italo-Franco-German,  only formally  linked  together  in  the  commonframework of a general Pact.  In the opinion  of  the  Italian Government,  thiswould represent a general weakening of the Locarno system, which it is certainly not the intention of any of the five Governments to bring about. It is  perhapsunnecessary for the Italian Government to call  the  attention  of  the  BritishGovernment to the  fact that, once the joint character of the Locarno guaranteeis weakened, the Treaty of Locarno would come  to lose not only one of its funda-.-mental characteristics, but also a function to which an  essential importance  hasalways, and rightly, been attributed.&quot;     The Belgian Government consider that the agreement must provide for under-ta kings of  non-aggression between  the  interested Powers:  .   . The  Belgian
Government note with satisfaction that the British Government do not subordinatethe guarantee which they are. disposed to give to  Belgium to the receipt of a reciprocal guarantee.  The Belgian Government consider that this question mustso far as they are concerned be viewed in the same manner by the other signatoryStates, and they  think it desirable to explain the  reasons.  As  a result of the geographical situation of Belgium any  aggression of  which she might be the victim would be a direct menace to other Powers.  By defending the access to her own territory Belgium contributes in  the most effective manner to the security ofthe  States which surround  her.   The accomplishment of  this  task  demandsimportant  sacrifices and  a  very considerable  effort.   Conscious of  her  dutiestowards the other nations as towards herself, Belgium is resolved  to undertake it.By so doing  she creates for herself a right in  given circumstances to assistance which the Powers threatened across her  territory would have a vital interest togive her.   She  considers that she will by these means  fulfil to the limit of herpowers the duty which is hers in this region of Europe Avbich has so often beenexposed to the  ravages of war.   Belgium will not, however, confine  to  this hercontribution  to the work of collective security.  She will continue to observe inrespect of the obligations of  the  Covenant the  scrupulous fidelity which she hasalways shown in the past.(ii)  Would  these non-aggression arrangements be  subject to exceptions on the         lines laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno?     5.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government hold  the view  that  the  non-aggressionagreements should be  &quot; subject to certain exceptions on the lines which were laiddown in Article  2 of the Treaty of Locarno,&quot; i.e., the exercise  of the  right oflegitimate defence and action under the Covenant of the League  of Nations.     The French  Government state that the obligation  of non-aggression shouldnot impede &quot; the exercise by one of the signatory Powers of the right of legitimatedefence,  that is, of the  right to oppose the violation  of the obligation definedabove.....It shall not be possible for the benefits of this new treaty (and, inparticular, the  obligation to render assistance which results from it) to be invokedby a signatory Power which  fails to observe the obligations laid down  in  it, or which shall undertake in Europe something contrary to the territorial integrityor political independence of  another Power, in particular by launching againstthe latter an unprovoked attack.  Consequently, the principle of  assistance  couldnot be brought  into force against a signatory State which, in accordance with theprinciples of the Covenant of the League of Nations, resists an act of aggression by one of the contracting parties against a State which is not a contracting party.In laying down this principle, the Government of the Republic have in mind theprovisions of Article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno.&quot;     The  German Government &quot; in  their peace plan  of  the 31st March havealready declared themselves prepared for a renunciation of  aggression  vis-a-visBelgium and France unrestricted by any exceptions. From their  standpoint theyhave no motive for weakening the security for  peace which lies in the conclusionof such an agreement  for the  renunciation of aggression by demanding exceptionsof any kind whatever. In case the other Governments concerned should think itnecessary to  insist on making exceptions of this kind, it would be  for them to putforward proposals to this end.   Meanwhile, however,  the German  government must indicate  at once that they do  not consider the method proposed by HisMajesty&apos;s  Government  in their  memorandum of  the 17th  September  to  be practicable.  In Article 2 of the Locarno Treaty, to which the memorandum refers,the  important  exceptions in  practice to the provisions for the  renunciation of aggression are  laid down with reference to the  provisions of the Covenant of theLeague of Nations, and. in particular to Article 16 thereof.  The repetition of theuse of this method is, in the view of the German Government, precluded by thefact that the interpretation of Article 16 has led to the  well-known differences ofopinion between  Germany and the other Locarno Powers/and, furthermore,  bythe fact that the discussion regarding the future of Article 16 and other provisionsof the Covenant of the League of Nations is at present still quite open.&quot;     The Italian Government  do not discuss this question pending a decision  on-question (i).  The fact that they  declare so  categorically for  the  maintenance of
 the principles of the Locarno Treaty cannot, it is feared, be taken as proof that they will not support the German view on this and other points.     The Belgian Government express no view. (iii) How shall a decision be reached as to whether the non-aggression undertaking         has been violated?     6.  His Majesty&apos;s Government state that &quot;the question whether the non- aggression undertaking has been violated  should be  submitted to the Council of the League of Nations.  In the case of a flagrant violation of a frontier, the guarantees might operate immediately, as in  the Treaty  of Locarno, pending a final pronouncement by the Council.&quot;     The French Government state that &apos;&apos; at least the mechanism contemplated by the Treaty of Locarno (Article 4), which comprises, on the one hand, the recogni- tion by the Council of the League of Nations of the fact that an act of aggression has taken place, and, on the other, in the  event of a flagrant violation of the above-mentioned obligation, the immediate application of the guarantees pending a definite decision of the Council, should be maintained with the necessary addition to forestall  the danger of sudden early attack.&quot;    The German Government &quot; do not consider it either necessary or appropriate to submit to the Council of the League of Nations the question of deciding whether an  infringement  of the  obligation of  non-aggression  has taken place, and consequently whether the guarantee obligation has entered into force.   It would be necessary to examine whether such decisions should not be  reached by a common decision of the parties to the treaty who are not  in  a given case directly parties to the conflict.  A distinction between flagrant breaches of the Treaty and other kinds of breaches of the Treaty, such as was laid down in the old Rhine Pact, will no longer come into consideration in the new pact.&quot;    The Italian Government express no view  in the circumstances described above : but,  as already  stated, it would be rash to assume that their preference for the Locarno model will induce them to prefer our views to those of Germany.    The Belgian Government express no view. (iv) Will it  be necessary to make special provision in the  new agreement for air-         attack ?    7.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  &apos;&apos; consider that special provision  should  be made in the guarantee arrangements under the new  agreement for immediate assistance in the event of an air attack which  constituted  a  violation of the non- aggression undertakings.   If this is done, a separate Air Pact would not. in their opinion, be necessary.&quot;    The French Government &quot; agree with the British Government in considering that a sudden air attack  should in any case be regarded  as a flagrant  violation of the  obligations undertaken^  and  should consequently  involve  immediate assistance by the other signatories to the State victim of the aggression.  The stipulations regarding this might either form the subject of  a special protocol  or be inserted in the general treaty.&quot;    The German Government state  that &quot;the obligations of non-aggression on which agreement is to be reached will naturally have to extend also to air attacks. Moreover, the rendering of assistance by the guarantor Powers would have to cover their air forces also.  The German Government, therefore, share the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that there is no necessity for a special air pact.&quot;    The Italian Government do not mention this point  in their Memorandum for the  reasons already stated. When Sir E. Brummond  asked Count Ciano if hewould be willing, supposing a return were made to the old Locarno Pact,  simul- taneously to conclude an  air convention  on  the lilies laid down in 1935,  Count Ciano said that he could not answer this question at once.  He observed,  however,that much had happened since 1935,  There was, for example, a new situation as.regards Belgium,    * It will be noted that these words are not those used by His Majesty&apos;s Government.
     As regards special provisions  for  dealing with  air  attack; the  Belgian Government have for more than a year shown the interest which they attach to such suggestions.                               -                      &apos; (v) Shall the neiv agreement contain provisions for arbitration and conciliation         as does the Treaty of Locarno f     8.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government &quot;suggest that  the new agreement should contain provisions for arbitration and conciliation as did the Treaty of Locarno; and for their part they would be ready to agree to such provisions.&quot;     The  French Government &quot;remain  in  favour of  the Treaties of Locarno regarding the settlement of  disputes by arbitration or judicial methods or by methods of conciliation; the conditions for the termination of these treaties have not been  fulfilled and consequently they  are still in force.  It would be well to complete  them by means of a promise of  assistance in the  event of one signatory Power  refusing to follow the procedures for pacific settlement thus laid down, or to  give effect to the decisions reached.  It is desirable, on the other hand,  that similar treaties should be concluded between those of the signatory Powers which have not hitherto concluded treaties to cover this question.&quot;     The German Government &quot; consider it appropriate that the parties to  the Treaty, especially those  between whom obligations of non-aggression are agreed upon, should at the same time  reach agreements for the settlement, by  suitable peaceful procedure, of the disputes arising between them.&quot;     The Italian Government make no statement on this point for reasons stated - above.     The Belgian Government consider that the new agreement might well,  like the Treaty of Locarno, contain  arbitration and conciliation clauses.                (C) A additional points to those  discussed above.     9.  These points  are     follows :-- (1) General  Settlement.                                -    His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  recall  that  the  London communique  of  the 23rd July stated that &quot; if  progress  could be made at  the Five-Power Meeting, other matters affecting European peace would necessarily come under discussion. In  these circumstances it would  be natural to look forward  to the widening of the area of discussion in such a manner as to facilitate, with the collaboration of the other interested Powers, the settlement of those  problems,  the solution of which is essential to the peace  of Europe.&quot;    The French Government state that their memorandum &apos;&apos; does not take into account all the questions which  will  arise  in  the course  of  the forthcoming conference for  the solution of which the  collaboration of other  countries  will be indispensable.  It has been purposely limited to the principal problems connected directly with the negotiation of the treaty to be substituted for the Treaty of Locarno, and which, for  this reason, and  subject to the eventual participation of the Netherlands in the negotiations (in this connexion please see (6) below) does not call for the participation of other  Powers than the signatories of the last- named treaty.   The Government  of the  Republic wishes  to point out that, in accordance with the spirit of the  arrangement of the 19th March, 1936,  and of the London Communique of the  23rd  July, this negotiation should be the prelude to a wider negotiation which implies the collaboration of the interested Powers.&quot;    The German Government &quot;  assume from the terms of the invitation conveyed to them on the  basis of the London Communique of the  23rd July last and their reply  thereto, that  the subject  to be dealt  with by the conference will  be  the replacement of  the old Rhine Pact of Locarno by a new pact between Germany, Belgium,  France, Great Britain and Italy.   If the communique in  question contemplates the discussion later on of other problems connected with,the securing of European peace,  a  decision  with  regard  to these problems  (as, indeed, the communique itself indicates) can only be reached when the result of the conference of the Five Powers, with respect  to the subject to be dealt with at that conference,has been arrived at.   The German Government must therefore reserve till then their attitude with regard to the question whether, and if so which, other problems in sdven circumstances might later be  discussed.&quot;
     The Italian Government do not deal with this point.     The Belgian Government express no view.(2) Demilitarised Zone.     His Majesty&apos;s Government recall that according to the London Communiqueof the 23rd July, 1936, &quot; the first business to be undertaken at such a meeting wasto be the negotiation of a new agreement to take the place of the Treaty of Locarnoand to resolve, through the collaboration of all concerned, the situation created bythe German initiative of the 7th March.&quot;     The French  Government  state that the  programme laid  down  in their memorandum &apos;&apos; does not exhaust the objects of the negotiations to be envisaged asregards  the settlement of the situation created on the  7th  March, 1936.   Inparticular, and in accordance with the provisions agreed upon on the 19th March,1936, suitable provisions should be adopted to  forbid  or restrict the  subsequenterection of fortifications in a zone to be defined.&quot;     The German Government state that &quot; the  structure of the  new pact would naturally have to take into account the political developments which  have given.rise to the plan for such a  pact.&quot;     The Italian Government say nothing.     The Belgian Government say nothing.(3)  Air Limitation.     The French Government call  attention  to the advantage of completing  theobligations of non-aggression and  assistance as regards sudden  aerial attack  byobligations for the limitation of air armaments.(4)  Staff A agreements.     The French  Government state  that &quot; as indicated in  the arrangementsconcluded at London on the.  19th March, 1936, technical agreements  must  be envisaged to ensure,  in case of necessity,  prompt  action on the part  of  the signatories,  and to prepare suitable measures to  render effective the  obligations.undertaken.&quot;(5)  Recognition of the proposed treaty  by third Powers.     The French Government consider that &quot; it would  be well to have the treatyrecognised by third Powers as an instrument designed to ensure the maintenance:of peace and to get them to undertake not to interfere with its application.&quot;(6) Inclusion of the Netherlands.     The French  Government draw attention  to the suggestion made  by  theGerman  Government in their Note of the 31st March, and to which Prance has.no objection, to include the Netherlands, if they so wish, in the new agreement,(7) Consultation between the Signatory Powers.     The French Government  draw attentioi to  the  possibility of consultation between the signatory Powers in the event of political tension between them witha view to render more efficacious the working of Article &apos;11 of the Covenant of the.League of Nations.                            .(8) Measures for  establishing facts concerning aggression.     The French  Government  suggest that each signatory  Power  should  beempowered to set up special organisations on its territory for this purpose.  these organisations, composed of foreign observers, would pronounce on the facts as to-any alleged attack or invasion.Foreign Office, October 23,  1936.
