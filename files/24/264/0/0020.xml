(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC                MAJESTY &apos; S GOVERNMENT) .COPY NO. 3^SECRET.CP. 245/36CABINETINDIA         Appreciation of the Political Situation, bythe Government of India, dated the 16th September, 1936.         Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India,
      Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situationin India, dated the 16th September,  1936,  issued on theauthority of the Secretary of State  for India.       Again it is possible to record a quiet month with no political developments of major importance.   The Monsoonhas, up to date, been favourable over the greater part ofIndia and in most provinces crops are reported to be verypromising.   In parts of the Bombay Presidency and in upper Burma the shortage of rain is causing some anxiety,while in the East of the United Provinces and in parts ofthe Punjab, Bihar and Bengal some damage has been caused byfloods.   In the United Provinces over 7,000 villages were affected but prompt and efficient measures were taken bylocal officers to deal with the grave situation caused bythis sudden and widespread flood, and in five districtsover 50,000 persons were rescued and provided with shelterand food.   As a result of this action the number of casulties was small as only 50 deaths have been reported^The damage in the other three provinces was not so extensive,but recent heavy rainfall has caused further damage in SouthBihar of which full details are not available .   If there are good harvests it may have a considerable effect on theforthcoming elections, for a contented peasantry is less likely to support any extreme programme or to listen torevolutionary agitation.2.     Congress have published their election manifestowhich bears signs of being a compromise between therevolutionary and reformist parties and has been skilfullydrafted to secure the acceptance of both parties.   a careful analysis, however, shows that it is more revolutionary
 than  reformist.   The  object of entering the Legislature is  definitely stated to be not to co-operate hut to combat the new  constitution and end it;  nothing new is said on the agrarian programme which is still left rather vague and this omission is resented by the All-India Kisan (Peasant)  Committee which has itself published a more extreme programme;  much space is devoted to the very contentious question of the communal award,- but though the manifesto  goes rather  further than the resolution of October, 1934, which stated that Congress neither accepted nor rejected the award, it is doubtful whether it will satisfy the Congress Nationalist Party, one ally of which, the democratic Swaraj party in Bombay, has already decided to oppose Congress candidates.   No decision has been arrived at on the  question of  office acceptance.   The manifesto has thus had rather a mixed reception;  in Bengal it is said to carry little conviction even among Congress supporters, though in Bombay it is said to have met with general approval. 3.      Reports from the provinces show that Congress may- be considerably hampered in their election campaign by the lack of funds;  balances in all Congress funds are low;   the enrolment of new members is making only very slow progress and it appears unliifely that the collection of four annas subscriptions from members will produce any considerable sum.   Mr. Gandhi himself is almost certainly in possession of or able to obtain large sums of money but it cannot be said at present how much he will make available for electioneering purposes;  it appears more  probable that  hewill use these funds only if a suitable opportunity offers of fostering a &quot;mass revolutionary mentality&quot;.   But though Congress is hampered in this way in its election campaign, the parties in opposition to Congress are  in no happier
plight, and, in many provinces, local, personal andcommunal  jealousies render the formation of well-organisedparties difficult.   In the United Provinces, as a resultof the visit of Mr. Jinnah, the President of the moslem league, some leading Moslems have deserted the NationalAgricultural Party which was intended to he non-communal.In Bengal Mr. Jinnah appears to have succeeded inreconciling the divergent views of conflicting Moslemparties, though it is doubtful how long this unity will bemaintained 04.      The intolerant attitude adopted by some Congressmembers towards their political opponents may cause somefeeling against them.   Recently in Bombay a reference bySir Cowasji Jehangir, the Liberal leader, to Pandit JawaharLai Nehru as the &quot;spoilt child of Congress&quot; led-to such anuproar by Congress socialists that the meeting had to be abandoned.5c,      Though it is as yet too early to estimate fully the reactions to brie policy adopted by His majesty&apos;s government in Palestine, it is probable that, though hither to the agitation has not met with much support, Moslems willresent the more intensive action which is being taken andwill hold that Moslem sentiments are being disregarded.        It is hoped, however, that reasonable Moslem leaderswill recognise that order must be restored before grievancescan be examined and that when that etage is reached the RoyalCommission will consider impartially the claims both of jews and Arabs.
