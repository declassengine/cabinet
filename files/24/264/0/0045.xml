            RAILWAY FREIGHT REBATES ON EXPORT GOAL.            Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.   1. On 1st October last I received a Deputation from the Exports Committee  of the Central Council of Colliery Owners, led by Sir Evan Williams, on  the subject of the proposals of the Government with regard to the future of the Railway Freight Rebates Scheme.   2. These proposals, which  are set out in CP. 161(36), (paragraph 9), of  22nd June,  provide for spreading the repayment of the deficiency  in the Rebates Fund, which is owing to the Railway Companies, over a period of 15 years, and for a concentration for  a period of 5 years of 4/5ths of the future income of the Fund on rebates for export coal, leaving ^/5th of the income, as  at present, for agricultural purposes.   It is calculated that, as a result, the average rebate per ton on coal for export will be just over 5d. instead of 3d.  as at present.   5. The Deputation protested strenuously against this proposal.Following the meeting they furnished me with a memorandum setting forth their vieus, a copy of which is attached.    In brief their case is as follows.   In 1929 the Government recognised that export coal required  assistance involving the expenditure of just on  2 million per annum.    Since 1929,  the  position of coal exports has steadily worsened;  therefore its present need forascistance is the  greater.   A loss of 3d.  on the rebates onexported coal would mean a very grave situation.    In themajority of cases  it -would be  impossible  to  pass  this  loss on tothe consumer, and  it is to  be  feared, therefore,  that  thereduction in rebates would mean loss of trade.    It  was  assertedthat this would particularly be  the  case  in  South Wales,  already a very depressed area.    Even  if trade  could be retained by  the exporting collieries it would  only  be by  means of  cut  prices,
 and immediately  there -would he  lahour difficulties.   The  workmen in the  exporting districts are  dissatisfied  with  their  present wages;   they  would &quot;bitterly resent any  cut in  those  wages  -which would follow  a  diminution  in  the  proceeds of the  industry    4.  The  coal  industry  points  out that the  greater  part  of  the proposed reduction in the  rate  of rebate is  attributable  to  the annual repayment to  the  Railway Companies of the  accumulated deficiency, and they suggest  (see penultimate  paragraph of attached memorandum) that  the Government should make  an annual contribution  to  the Rebates Fund  of  some  600,000,  in the  form of a loan, until such time as an upward revision  of  railway assessments augments the income yf the  Fund  to such  an  extent as to  make it once more  self-supporting,    5. This suggestion requires  consideration from two points of view:   (a) The  Government  proposals  contemplated  a measure of sacrifice all round.   The Railway Companies were to  forego                                                    A interest on the  sums owing to them;  agriculture  was  to be satisfied with a  reduced sum for rebates;  the iron and steel industry was to  have no  rebates at all.   If, however, the Rebates Fund is  to receive direct Government assistance,  I am advised that the other parties interested in the Fund  will almost certainly withdraw the measure  of sacrifice  which they  were prepared to make  to help coal exports,  since the  effect of their sacrifice would merely be to reduce the Bxchequer assistance.   It  seems clear, therefore, that, in the long run, the Government would be  called upon to make  a very much larger contribution than the  600,000 per annum suggested by the coal industry.   (b)  The coal industry claims that government assistance  to the Fund would not be  a subsidy,  but merely a
 continuation of a form of assistance,  which was not a subsidy and to which the Government are committed.    We have always claimed that the Railway Freight Reo^tes Scheme was not  a Government subsicy hut a re-arrangement of  the burdens-  of taxation.    The Rebates Fund is made up of  contributions  by the Railway Companies  of the amounts by which they were relieved of local rates under the Local Government Act,  1929. It is  true that Government  grants were mo.de  to Local Authorities to  make good their losses  in rates,  but these grants will continue unamended in spite of the diminished income of  the Rebates  Funa.    The industry are now asking for an entirely new form of assistance - a direct contribution to the Rebates  Funa.    In my view, it  is beside  the point whether this is a loan or not.    I do  not think it could  be disguised  that  it is a subsidy for the&apos; coal  export trade.    6.   I do  not wish in any way to minimise  the  present difficulties of the exporting, districts, particularly South  Wales.    They are serious,  and I accept the  contention &quot;chat they  will  be accentuated by a reduction even  of about 3d. per  ton  on  the  average  in freight  rebates.   On the other hand,  if the rebates were preserved  at  their present  level, the troubles of the depressed exporting  districts would not be  solved.   In these  circumstances, I  think that  the proposal of  the coal  industry that there  should,  in effect, he a Government subsidy  of  just  over  2-jjrd. per ton in favour of export coal  is  one  thut should not be entertained.    It is a proposal which would  involve us  in all the difficulties which would follow  in the train  of an export subsidy without materially improving our competitive position or dealing with the real problem, which is the depressed state of SouthWales and Durham.
        inform the Central Council of Colliery Owners that, after        careful consideration of the views which they have  advanced,        the Government are not prepared, for the reasons set out        above, to give financial assistance to the Railway Freight        Rebates Fund, or to modify the proposals with regard to that        Fund which have already been communicated to the Council.        The Council have asked that they should have an opportunity        of meeting the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President        of the Board of Trade in order to &quot;represent to them        personally the necessity for action on the part of the        Government to avoid a reduction in the rate of rebate&quot;.        It seems to me that such a meeting would serve no useful        purpose and I propose that I should be authorised to inform -        Sir Evan Williams accordingly.           8.  The  proposals submitted above are made on the        assumption that no  assistance whatever will be given from the        Exchequer  to the Rebates Fund.    I understand,  however, that        the Railway Companies have pointed out that the annual        repayment  to them from the Fund will be subject to        assessment for income tax - which will be an unexpected        windfall for the Exchequer - and have suggested that the        Exchequer  should forego those receipts.    I am not concerned        to argue whether the  adoption of such a course would be        equivalent to an Exchequer subsidy to the Fund.    But what        seems  clear is that,  if such a suggestion were accepted,  the        Exchequer  would be  making a grant to the Fund.    If there  is        to be  any  such grant  at all I would urge that it should be        sufficient to give  the coal export trade a chance of fighting        to regain  lost markets.    This would mean that it would        be necessary that the effective annual income of the Fund        should at  least be  made up to its present amount ( 4 million)        and possibly more and that the rebates should be concentrated        on coal exported to selected markets only.ies Department,                                  H&apos;G*21st October,  1936.
          Copy of a Memorandum dated 6th October, 1936.   Received from the Exports Committee of the Central Council                      of Colliery Owners.     When the Railway Freight Rebates Scheme was formulated in 1923 it was explained by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that this relief would be concentrated in helping those industries in which the need was greatest and that its efficacy consisted in the fact that it was concentrated mainly upon the basic trades in which unemployment was most prevalent.   (Hansard,Volume 222, Columns 264/5).      The three selected industries were coal, agriculture and iron and steel and in the case of coal the relief was concentrated on those sections of the industry in which it was most needed and most &quot;likely to assist in relieving unemployment,namely, the coal export trade and coal for iron and steelworks.     The assistance which the coal export trade has derivedfrom the Railway Freight Rebates has been of inestimable value to it.    In the struggle to retain markets in face of heavily subsided foreign competition export prices were reduced tolevels which involved substantial losses despite the help ofthe freight rebate, and but for that help the shrinkage of our trade in unprotected markets abroad,  great as it has been,would have been much more serious.     The depletion of the Freight Rebate Fund resulting fromthe reductions in the railway companies&apos;  assessments,  which date.back to 1931,and the consequent reactions on the amount available for payment of railway freight rebates are causing the gravest concern to the coal export trade.    This situationarises at a time when the difficulties of the export trade are far greater than those which existed when the government considered it prudent to make the provision which is reflected in the existing rate of rebate which averages 8d. per ton.     It is understood that the government propose to deal withthe situation by introducing legislation which will transfer to coal the 10 per  cent,  of the Freight Rebate Fund at present                       -5-
allotted to iron and steel, and will provide that the resulting80 par cent, of the Fund thus available to coal will be concentrated on the present coal etc.  export traffics, namely 5-     Coal,  coke and patent fuel for export (including bunkers      for foreign going vessels and fishing vessels)     Such coal delivered to patent fuel works as is used      for manufacture of exported patent fuel.     Such coal delivered to a washery as is washed or cleaned      thereat before being exported.     Such coal delivered to a coke oven (situate elsewhere than      at an iron or steel works) as is used for the manufacture      of coke which is exported.     The decision in regard to iron and steel seems inaccordance  with the principles enunciated when the Scheme wasformulated  since that industry is no longer in a depressedcondition but has attained a large measure of prosperity withthe help of the protective measures which in the meantime theGovernment.&apos; s tariff policy has provided for it;  and it is hardly to be supposed that objection will be raised by the ironand steel industry.     Even with ths adjustments above referred to,  however, itappears that the average rate of rebate on export coal would bereduced from 8d.  to 5d.  per ton and this is a prospect which theexport trade cannot contemplate without dismay.     The importance of the figure of 3d. per ton in the exporttrade was stressed by the Minister of Labour himself during the debates on  the Scheme in 1928.   Speaking as a  former buyer of export coal from this country he said:-        &quot;I  know well, as between the different  offers, what     &quot;difference is made by 3d.  a ton ......  The ordinary     &quot;foreign buyer sets the British exporter against the     &quot;exporter from Silesia and against the exporter from     &quot;Germany and everywhere else.   If then,  as I have given     &quot;in my own personal experience, 3d. may make all the     &quot;difference can anyone deny that  a reduction in the export     &quot;rate  of 7^d.  is not likely to be of vast  help to the     &quot;industry?   That is one form of help which we are     &quot;providing&quot;.(Hansard, Volume 222, Columns 399/400).
      It is true that part of our markets in the trade agreement countries is protected by those agreements, hut that is only a Comparatively small fraction of our export and foreign hunker trade and it is no exaggeration to say that the loss of 3d.  per ton would be disastrous to the trade.   Moreover the figure of 3d. is an average and in the case of certain districts - those which ship at the Hurnber and Mersey - the average reduction would be 6d.  or 7d. per ton.     The larger part of the reduction from 8d. to 5d. is&apos; attributable to the payment of  6(3^,000 per annum out of the Fund for a period of 15 years in order to recoup the railway companies for their overpayments into the Fund since 1931.     A suggestion which the industry has ventured to put forward in or:&quot;er to meet the position is that the Government might make an annual advance to the Fund of such amount as is necessary to maintain the rebate at least at 8d. until improvement in trade and consequently in railway/ revenue results in a revision of the railway companies&apos;  assessments which will increase the income of the Railway Freight Rebates Fund and enable the advance to be repaid,,     It is felt necessary to reiterate that the situation whichwould be created by any reduction in the rate of rebate wouldbe one of the utmost gravity both in the- way of loss of tradeand by reason of its repercussions on the labour situation,which would immediately become critical in certain districtsboth from the point of view of employment and ability to maintain the present rate of wages.
