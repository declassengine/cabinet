S E C R E T.COPY NO.                    CABINET.              THE SITUATION IN PALESTINE..             THE QUESTION OF MARTIAL LAW.  .                 LAW OFFICER&apos;S REPORT.                  (Reference Cia/o/43).     From what we understand the position  in Palestine to be,we do not think that a Proclamation of martial law would confer on General Dill the powers which it is desired toconfer upon him.   As we have already stated a Proclamationof this kind does not in itself  confer any greater powers over the civil population than are already possessed atcommon law, depending on the necessities of the case.  Havingregard to the wide powers which  we understand it is desired  toconfer-on General Dill, we think it would he a very unsafemethod of procedure to rely solely on common law powers inpresent circumstances.     In our opinion the proper procedure is so to amend thePalestine Defence Order in Council of 1931 as to enable thepowers which are thought necessary to be conferred upon general Dill.   We proceeded to  consider,  with the officials from the Departments, what these powers were.  From what wewere told It appeared to us that they could be formulated asfollows     (1)  That General Dill should have power to make any regulations for public safety which in his opinion were necessary for that purpose and that the validity of those
 regulations  should  not  he  open to challenge  in any - court of law,      (2)  That  he should have  power to set up military courts for the trial  of any offences against those regulations;   that he should he able to provide that  there should he no appeal;   and that the jiidgments and orders of those courts should not he open to challenge or review elsewhe2&apos;*ec     lb would? of course^ he open  to General  Dill to provide that sentences imposed  &quot;by such courts  should  not he carried out until the case had been considered by  himself or any other authority he might  designate0    This would be entirely a matter for him.      (5)   It should be  made clears  and this  indeed is done  in  the  existing Defence Order in Council in the proviso  to Article  IV,  that the  special powers conferred in no way prejudice or  derogate  from the ordinary  conation lav/ powers of a military commander dealing with war, rebellion or disturbances.     There were certain other  subsidiary points  raisedwhich we  deal with  In the  draft  amendments set out below and our  comments on them are made  as  they arise.   We should perhaps malce  it  clear that,  so  far as  we  are concerned, all we are doing is to  suggest what we believe to be the  legal and  effective method  of  carrying out the policy which has been  decided upon.   We may or maynot have been successful in fully understanding  whatpowers It is  desired to confer.
      (l)   We suggest that  the  words  in Article IV (l)  &quot;the High Commissioner&quot; should be  omitted and there should be substituted the words &quot;persons  in the service of the  Government  of Palestine11.    This alteration seems to us  appropriate having regard to the change which is contemplated,      (2)   We propose on page 2, line 3, after the word &quot;particular&quot; to insert the words &quot;but without prejudice  to the generality of the foregoing power&quot;.            This  is  a drafting  amendment in order to make  it quite  clear that regulations can be made of any kind for securing public safety.      (3)   After  IV  (l)  (g)  insert &quot;(h)  The infliction of  fines upon  bodies of persons or upon corporations and the forfeiture  and  destruction of property  as punitive measures whether actual offenders can  or cannot be  identified,&quot;           We understand that regulations of this kind  have  already been  issued  and acted upon, but that  there  is  some  doubt as to- whether they are covered by the existing words  of the Order.      (4-)   Leave  out  from the words in the middle ofpage  2 &quot;and may by  such Regulations&quot; to the end of sub-paragraph  (ii)  on the same page,  and substitute &quot;and may by such Regulations authorise the trial by Civil Courts (including Courts of  Summary Jurisdiction) or  such military courts as may be  established by theRegulations, of persons committing offences  against theRegulations or any other offences  under  the  law for
 the  time being in force  in Palestine, arid the infliction by any civil  courts  or by any military courts established as aforesaid  of such punishments as may be prescribed, in the case of offences  against the Regulations, by the Regulations,  or,  in  the  case of other offences, by the  law for the time being in force.&quot;          This  introduces the military courts, which are  further dealt with below.   We have left in the  civil courts.    It may be that this a desirable power  to retain.   It need not, of course, be exercised if it  is considered  that all matters dealt with should go to  the military courts.    We have cut out the power conferred under  the  existing Order for trial by courts martial as this  appears  to be no longer necessary.The  amendment as drafted also conferred power toauthorise the trial by Military Courts of offences against the ordinary law.     (5)  Page  3.   Omit paragraph (2) ana the provisoat the top of  the page.          As the procedure by military courts is beingsubstituted for the Courts Martial procedure, thisparagraph is unnecessary.     (6)  Insert the following new paragraphs (2) and(5)  in Article  IV: -    &quot;(2)   The procedure and practice of military    courts established by Regulations made under this    article may be determined by Regulations under    this article or by such authority and in such    manner as the Regulations may -prescribe. &quot;
          &quot;(3) Regulations under this article may make          provision for appeals from judgments or orders          of military courts established as aforesaid or          may provide that there shall be no such appeal and          that such judgments and orders shall not be called          in question in any other court or in any other          manner whatever.&quot;      The existing paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) of Article IVwill remain as in the present Order except that they will - be re-numbered (4),(5) and (6) and the words &quot;by the Governor&quot; in theexisting paragraph (5) should be omitted.  The word &quot;Governor&quot;is a misprint and the words are unnecessary.     (7) Paragraph (5) of Article V should be amended by sub-stituting for the words &quot;cause any buildings to be pulled downand removed, and any property to be removed from one plpce toanother, or to be destroyed&quot; the words &quot;cause any building orother property of any kind whatsoever to be removed from one place to another or destroyed in such manner as he shall think fit&quot;.         This is a. small drafting amendment arising out of the criticism made in the courts in Palestine of the existingwording.     (8) Paragraph (15) of Article V should be deleted.  Underthis article as at present drafted the High Commissioner canonly delegate his powers under Article V.   We understand thatit is desired that he should have power to delegate also his powers under Article IV and we would suggest that there shouldbe substituted a new A-rticle VA  to read, as follows : -          &quot;The High Commissioner may, if he           thinks fit, by Proclamation delegate           to the General Officer Commanding the           Forces in Palestine all or any of his           powers under Articles IV and V of this           Order.&quot;         It was suggested to us that it might be desired toreinvest in the High Commissioner some of these powers should
  the situation improve.  We think this point could he met if  the Proclamation to he made contained appropriate words  limiting its effect until further Proclamation.       (9) We suggest the following new Article VB :-            HVB0  Regulations made under this Order             shall have effect as if enacted in this             Order and where any Regulations mads by             the High Commissioner or by any person             to whom he shall-have delegated powers to             make Regulations und^r this Order purport             to have been made under this Order , they-             shall be deemed to have been lawfully so             made and their validity shall hot be called             in question in any court of law or in any .             other manner whatsoever, and all Regulations             which, purport to have &quot;been made by the High             Commissioner or by a person to whom he has             delegated the power to make Regulations under             this Order shall be presumed, unless the             contrary be shown, to have been made by the             High Commissioner or by such a person as             aforesaid as the case may be.&quot;       The Amending Order should also provide that Article VB as setout /above should apply to all Regulations under the Principal  Order whether made before or after the date upon which this  Order comes into operation;   provided that this should not  affect any judgment -;r order of any court given or made before  that date.

           shall become due and payable,  and particularly may so           extend the period of maturity of bills or other negotiable           instruments payable in Palestine, and may suspend for           such time  as he  may think right the execution of  the           judgment  of any  Court of Civil Judicature,  and the  en-           forcement of any process of evictment or other process           for the recovery of  the possession of property in default           of payment of rent, if he shall consider  that, owing to           circumstances arising  out of the State  of War  or  the           immediate apprehension of War, the immediate execu-           tion of such judgments or enforcement  of such process           would be  inequitable or inexpedient.     (15)  The High Commissioner may, if he thinks fit,  delegate           to the  Naval, Military or Air  Authorities in Palestine           any of his powers under this Article.  VI.

VII. His Majesty may from time to time revoke, alter, add to oramend this  Order.
