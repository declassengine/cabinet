THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT                   Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1936SECRET.                                                         Copy No.  42C,P.  275 (36).\ *;*A.)I i                                CABINET.LIVESTOCK  INDUSTRY  BILL.          Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,   ?-     AT its meeting on the 10th June last (Cabinet 41  (36), Conclusion 7), the Cabinet gave general approval to the recommendations of a Cabinet Committee oil-Meat Policy and the Cattle Subsidy.        1- uu; Following this approval, I made an agreed.statement of policy in the House of Commons on the 6th July, in which it was announced that Parliament would be asked to provide for assistance on a permanent basis to producers of fat cattle,: and for the application of such sums not exceeding  5 million, per annum as may from time to time be needed for this purpose.  As a precautionary measure, power would be sought to enable the Board of Trade to regulate&apos;imports of livestock and meat.   Legislation to give effect to the permanent proposals, including measures for the encouragement and promotion of efficiency, would be introduced early next Session.   &apos;:  A short Bill extending, without modification, the then existing cattle subsidy arrangements for a further limited period was passed before the end of July to carry the industry along  until  the  permanent proposals could be brought before Parliament and put into effect.     During the Recess, an outline of the permanent legislation has been prepared. Consultation  has  taken place  with  the  Ministry of Health and the Scottish Departments  concerned.     In addition to the subsidy proposals  and  the provision for  import control, the  outline  provides  for a  permanent  Livestock  Commission  to take  over responsibility  for subsidy administration from the present temporary Cattle Committee  (which  will  then lapse)  and to undertake certain  other duties  in connection&apos;with the promotion of efficiency.  The efficiency measures contemplated fall into three parts and provide for      (a) Market Reform. The  improvement of the system of livestock markets by           (i) the bringing forward of schemes, where desirable,  for the closure,           with compensation,  of small, inefficient markets,  that are redundant           and harmful,  by (ii) the release of market owners, where necessary;           from out-of-date and useless  restrictions imposed by Charters and           local Acts, and by  (iii) raising the standard of  administration and           equipment  in  livestock markets generally;     (b) Experiment in Central Slaughter. rThe setting up of  not more  than           three local experiments in centralised slaughtering on factory  lines,           power being taken to enable inefficient slaughterhouses in  such experi-           mental areas to  be  closed down if necessary, subject to  appropriate           compensation; these areas will be chosen in. close consultation  with           local interests;     (c) Service Schemes. The promotion by the  industry of its own commercial           development  and  technical  proficiency   through services  such  as           advertising, experimental schemes (of which  canning might be  one),           and the encouragement  of education and research.  The  cost of  such           schemes will be charged against those deriving benefit.  Each of these           steps  has  been  repeatedly pressed for  by  Commissions,  such  as           Lord Bingley&apos;s Fatstock Reorganisation Commission, and in Debates           in both Houses.       [13977]
     In regard to livestock markets, there are about 1,000 of them, in England and&quot;Wales alone,  and not far short of 20 million head of stock pass  through thesemarkets each  year.  There has been no general enactment regulating markets i&apos;or00  years;  meanwhile, transportation has been  twice revolutionised,  and  far-reaching changes have taken place in the sources and distribution of our food supplies.   The markets system needs  to be brought up-to-date in order to ensurefor  the farmer  the best possible returns  from  the  sale of  his stock undercompetitive conditions.     In the case of slaughterhouses, I propose an admittedly cautious approach,but it is essential that we should know what kind of centralised slaughtering  toencourage before undertaking far-reaching changes in slaughtering arrangements.The home  farmer, however, has to compete with meat from overseas which  iskilled and  shipped from meat-works operating on the most up-to-date lines, andhe is at a disadvantage so long as he is not served with corresponding efficiency.     The provision  for  &apos;&apos; Service&apos;&apos;  schemes  should  enable  reforms  that the livestock industry has frequently advocated to be tried out, without the necessityfor setting up Marketing Boards as an essential preliminary.     I have some reason to hope that the numerous interests concerned in Englandand Wales, including local authorities, will regard these reforms as reasonably inthe circumstances,  and will co-operate  in fashioning them into a workmanlikewhole&apos;.  In view  of  the  death  of the  Secretary  of  State  for   Scotland,Colonel Colville,  the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State,  desires to reserve the position of Scotland with regard to the application of these proposals to thatcountry.    I accordingly ask for the authority of the Cabinet to continue, in conjunctionwith  the other Ministers concerned, the preparation of  legislation on these lines,and to present a Bill to the  Home Affairs Committee at an early date.                                                 (Initialled)       W.  E. E.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,    10 Whitehall Place, S.W 1,        October 23, 1936
