CABINET.        VOLUNTARY INSURANCE  OF BLACK-COATED WORKERS AND  OTHERS&apos;  &quot;     FOR WIDOWS1 , ORPHANS1 AND OLD AGE  CONTRIBUTORY PENSIONS.&apos;  &quot;                                                         Copy No                   Memorandum by the Minister  of Health.           1.   Our Election Manifesto  of  last  year contained  the     following paragraph:-                &quot;The Contributory Pensions scheme has been  a boon of     inestimable value to large numbers  of  the  people.  But  it  has     always been recognised that it was  not complete go long as persons     with small incomes, but  not themselves insurably employed,  were     unable to share in its benefits.  Accordingly the Government will,     if returned, supplement  the present scheme  by arrangements which     will permit other men -  and women too  - whether working on their     own account or not, such as shopkeepers, clerks and  other  black-     coated workers, whose income does not  exceed a certain  limit, to     enjoy the benefits of widows1 , orphans1 and old age  contributory     pensions on a voluntary  basis&quot;j           2.   The task of  formulating a  scheme was entrusted to a     Committee of Departmental Officials  and the following are  the main     recommendations of the Committee:-           (i) The scheme to be open to any uninsured person -               (a) with total income not exceeding  400  a year (man)                   or  250 a year (woman);               (b) subject to unearned  income  (if any) not  exceeding                    200 a year (man) or  125 a  year (woman);               (c) aged under 55 years  at  date  of admission, if within                   twelve months of initial date;  thereafter,  aged                   under 40  years;               (d) resident-  in Great Britain for at least 10 years                   prior to  application.          (ii)  The benefits to be widows1, orphans1  and old age     pensions as in the present Contributory Pensions scheme,                                1.
including the continuance of the old age or widows pensionafter age 70 without any question as to means.     (iii) Qualifications for pension to be: -           (a) for widow7s pension - Two years1  insurance and               payment of at least 104 contributions;           (b) for old age pension - Ten years1  insurance and               payment of at least 260 contributions;      (iv) Pull rate of pension to be dependent on the paymentof an average of 50 contributions a year;  the rate to beproportionately reduced on a sliding scale if the average fallsbelow this figure.       (v) The contributions to be : -           (a) for entrants within twelve months of the initial               date, who do not possess unearned income               exceeding  125 a year (men) or  75 a year (women).                Is.3d. a week for men:                           j                   Sd. a week for women;           (b) for other entrants in the first twelve months               and for all subsequent entrants.,,  on a scale               graduated according to age, the contribution for :               a man who is under 21 being Is-3d. and for a man                 -               whose age is over 39 but under 40, 2s.lid;  for               women the rate to be 6d. a week for all enorants               under 25, rising to lid. a week for women who are               over 39 but under 40.               Wote:  The Committee was unable to agree whether          or not these contributions should be subject to the   !          decennial increases provided for in the present          scheme.  These increases are 2d. a week for a man andj          Id. a week for a woman and are due to take effect on          1st January, 1946 and again on 1st January, 1956 (the;          first of the three increases took effect on          1st January of this year.)      (vi) Continuance of insurance to be dependent on thepayment of at least 26 contributions a year,  subject toeasier conditions for contributors who reach the age of 60
 (55 in the case of women), having been insured for at least10 years.       (vii) Certain free insurance benefits and rights of re-entry to be granted on lapse from insurance.      (viii) The Exchequer to bear the cost of administrationof the scheme and to make good the capital liabilityarising from the acceptance of contributions of lower value than the benefits, especially in the case of initial entrantsunder  (v)(a) above.       (ix) The scope of the scheme as defined in (i) tobe subject to modification as regards certain classes ofpersons (mainly police and male teachers) who were whollyexcluded from the operation of the Contributory pensions scheme;  of these, police, &amp;c., whose superannuationconditions cover widows1  and orphans1  pensions as well asretirement pensions, not to be eligible to become voluntary-contributors;   male teachers, whose superannuation conditionscover retirement pension only,  to be allowed to becomevoluntary contributors for widows1  and orphans1  pensions only at appropriate contributions.            Consequential modifications of existing system.        (x) Existing voluntary contributors and personsceasing to be  compulsorily insured hereafter to have the option of continuing as voluntary contributors (a) for healthinsurance and pensions at the present contribution (Is..8d, ) for (b) for pensions only at a contribution of lid. a week,but subject in both cases to decennial increases,  which willmake these contributions ls.l0d.  and Is.Id. respectivelyin 1946 and 2s.Od. and Is. 3d.  in 1956,
       (xi ) The conditions as to payment of contributions,qualification for pension, benefits on lapse, &amp;c, to bethe same under both systems, wherever appropriate; so thatin future the only important differences between onevoluntary contributor and another will be in regard to(a) rates of contribution payable, and (b) option tocontinue to contribute for health insurance in cases whereinsurance has previously been compulsory.       3.   The first question which arises is whether the                                                              Ischeme embodied in the recommendations of the Committeecarries out the Government&apos;s pledge.  There is, I think,one particular in which it might be suggested that it fell short of the undertaking.  It will be seen that theCommittee recommends that a person in possession of anunearned income exceeding a specified amount should notbe eligible for admission to the scheme.  It could be argued that there are two possible interpretations ox the pledge, (l) that the scheme would be limited to occupiedpersons and (S) that it would be open to all persons whosatisfied the income test.  I think it will be agreed thatthe provision of pensions of which a large part is provided                                                              fby the Exchequer could not be justified in the case of menwho have unearned incomes approaching  400 per annum and                                                              Ithat,  therefore,  some restriction is necessary.  The Committee  *has  suggested that persons with unearned incomes of atleast half the maximum limits should be ineligible for admission but they make the  further proposal that where  an initial  entrant does not fail on this groundbut has an unearned income exceeding  125 per annum in the case of a  man or  75  in the case of a woman,  theadvantage of the  -very generous flat rate  of contribution
contribution should not be allowed, but that the rate of contribution payable should be that appropriate to age.It may be questioned whether the figure at which theCommittee has fixed the amount of unearned income which willexclude a person from the scheme is a reasonable one.   Therecan be little doubt that a higher figure would increase thenumber of entrants, but at a cost to the Exchequer whichit might well be argued could not be justified by thecircumstances of the individuals concerned, when regard ishad to the fact that in addition to any Exchequer assistance towards the cost of the benefits up to age 70 the scheme would provide them with over-70 pensions entirely at thecost of the Exchequer.    The further  proposal of theCommittee - that a person eligible for admission in the&apos; first year whose unearned income exceeds a specified figure should pay the rate appropriate to his age instead of the flat rate paid by the main body of initial entrants - is againopen to the challenge that it will tend to reduce the numberof entrants.   There is however reason to think that thenumber of persons in this class would not be appreciable sothat the imposition of  this special income test would infact have little effect on the number of entrants.   On theother hand if persons in this class were admitted at the flat rate of contribution the extra liability thereby imposed onthe Exchequer would be  small.   I admit that this proposal of the Committee is theoretically unassailable but,  if  its acceptance would have little effect on the cost of the  scheme,I think it would be better to omit it.    The inclusion  ofsuch a provision would  undoubtedly make for complicationboth in the presentation and in the working of the scheme.
      4.    The Committee  states that  it  is  extremely difficult tc assess the numbers who would he  eligible for admission to the scheme but on the meagre data available hazards the opinion that  the  number  of men eligible  at the  outset might be put at  between 1,000,000  and 1,200,000.   It points out that if  the experience of  the existing scheme affords any guidance,  the proportion of those eligible who would elect to enter could not  safely be put above  20&apos;;b.   This would give approximately 250,000 entrants in the initial period and on that  basis the capital cost to the Exchequer in respect of  benefits to the age of 70 would be in the neighbourhood of  19,001,000 which could  be redeemed  in 30 years by an annual charge of   1,000,000.    As regards women, the Committee states &quot;We  have  made  no  assessment of the cost of the scheme in  respect  of  women entrants.   Their number is likely to be insignificant  and will,  in any event, involve only a relatively  small addition to the Exchequer liability in respect of  men&quot;.   While the experience of insurance companies supports this view as regards the permanent scheme which involves the payment of contributions appropriate to age at entry it  is difficult to believe that  the  extremely favourable terms  offered to women entrants  in the first year  willmeet with no response.   The rate of contribution  to provide an  old age pension between the ages of 65  and 70appropriate to a woman aged 40  is lid.,  aged 45 Is.5d.,  aged 50 2s.2d., aged 55 3s.8d.   One  would expect that  an appreciable number of women between  40 and  55 would  welcome the opportunity of securing old  age  pensions for a weekly contribution of 6d.    I  am advised that  the number of women of the age of 40 and upwards who  will satisfy the  conditionsof eligibility in the first  year  of  the  scheme  may amount to400,000 and that  the  capital cost to  the Exchequer for  ever:-:                             - 6  -
 1,000 women in this class who enter the scheme might range from  40,000 to  50,000.          The Committee&apos;s proposals would, apart from the expenses of  administration and the financial effect of the exercise of selection, impose no liability on the Exchequer in respect of benefits up to the age of 70 for entrants after the first year. The proposals would involve an additional Exchequer liability in respect of over-70 pensions for all entrants but there would be no appreciable charge under this head in the first 15 years of the scheme&apos;s operation.   Thereafter the charge would grow slowly and might amount to  1,500,000 to  2,000,000 a year in about 3.0 years&apos; time.   For the purpose of this estimate the Committee assumed that one half of the entrants would be qualified for over- 70 pensions independently of the new scheme.     5.   While no estimate can be made of the number of persons likely to enter there is no doubt that the attractiveness of the scheme will be largely determined by the rates of contribu.tions charged.   As regards the contribution proposed for the male initial entrant, I feel that this could not be reduced below the suggested rate of Is.3d. a week without unfairness to the. compulsoriljr insured class, whose contributions when the last decennial increase is operative will reach that figure.   On the same ground the case against a reduction of the contribution proposed forwomen initial entrants is even stronger.    On this view,  the possibility of reducing contributions is  limited to those qualified to enter after the initial period.    Any reduction in the rates of these contributions would  of course throw a liability upon the Exchequer for every post-initial entrant affected and it  is doubtful whether any reduction which might be considered financially possible  would so improve the attractiveness of the scheme as to make  a material                            - 7 -
  increase in the number of entrants.      6.    The Committee proposes that v/hen the new  scheme takes, effect persons who are voluntary contributors under the existing scheme,  which involves insurance for both health and pensions purposes,  should be allowed  to  elect to  continue both insurances or to become insured for pensions purposes only, and that so far as their pensions insurance  is  concerned the conditions should as far as possible be assimilated to those of the new scheme, I understand that  this proposal  is not intended to  involve an increase in  the  rate of contribution payable by them as voluntar contributors -for pension purposes but applies mainly to the conditions entitling to benefit,  e.g. the annual minimum number of contributions payable and the  determination of the rate of pension  according to the average  number of contributions paid fo each  year throughout  the insurance life.   While I appreciate th desirability of  making the conditions of voluntary pensions insurance as far as  possible identical for all contributors I feel  that, if the  Committee&apos;s proposal were adopted  in  its entirety, there would  be no answer to the charge that the contract made with existing contributors was being broken. YtThile therefore  I  agree  that the contributor who elects  to discontinue  his  health  insurance should be required  to  accept the new pensions  conditions  I recommend that in the  case of  the contributor who  elects to continue both insurances the  conditions at present applying to him as regards pensions  insurance should remain unchanged.      7.   It  is  shown in the  summary of the  Committee&apos;s  proposals that the Committee was unable to agree  on the question whether decennial increases of contributions, which are  a feature  of  the existing contributory pensions scheme,  should be  imposed in thenew scheme.   The arguments for  and  against these increases are set out in the following extract  from the  Committee&apos;s Report:-
           &quot;In the view of some of us there are strong arguments  for imposing on the new class the same decennial increases  as are payable by other insured persons.   In the first place, the contribution scales for post-initial entrants provide only for the cost of benefits up to a&amp;e 7 0, and in the case of most, if not all, of the entrants in the initial period the proposed flat rate of contribution of Is.3d. for a man and 6d. for a -woman will be quite inadequate to meet this portion of the benefits.   Secondly, the scheme also provides for pensions over 70 for all voluntary contributors, and since a large proportion would not become qualified, for an over-70 pension on the ground of small means this benefit represents a substantial addition to the charge of the scheme upon the Exchequer.   It is therefore deemed reasonable that the new class of voluntary contributors should pay the same decennial increases as will be required from employers and workers under the compulsory scheme. Finally, it is thought to be injudicious that any class should be exempt from the increases of contribution to which persons who are compulsorily insured will be subjected in 1946 and again in 1956; differentiation in this respect between the various classes of insured persons would, it is feared, create a.sense of grievance and might imperil the general imposition of the increases due in 1946.   The additional income which would be derived from. the increases (2d. for men and Id.  for women) in respect of the new class is not a material factor,  but the loss^of income which would arise if the increases in the  ordinary rates of contribution due in 1946 were by any chance defeated would be a very serious matter for the Exchequer.          Those who take the other  view are not persuaded that failure to follow the precedent of  the existing scheme as regards decennial increases need jeopardise  the increases which are due to take effect under that scheme  in 1946 and 1956, and they feel that no other argument can be advanced in favour of decennial increases
 in the new scheme.    They contend, that,  since  one  of the main reasons for fixing  the  initial  rates  of  contribution at Is.3d. (men)  and 6d.  (women) was that   these  sums were  thought to be as much as the  classes  for whom the scheme was primarily intended could  reasonably be  expected  to pay,  it would not be logical to ask  them to  pay increased contributions at a later date,  and possibly  when many  of them were by reason of advanced age less able to  bear an  increase than at the  outset.   They point  out,  that while there is  room for  difference of opinion as to what is the  highest  contribution which the  contributors can reasonably be expected  to pay,  there can be no question that, if the scheme  is to  have a fair  prospect  of success,  the rates of contribution for  initial  entrants must be fixed  at sums far below  the  amounts required to meet the cost of the benefits. That being  so,  the  interests  of  the Exchequer  require that the maximum contribution  which  can  reasonably be demanded should be charged from the  outset,  whereas  the imposition  of decennial increases would be  tantamount to  an admission  that the original contribution  was less  than that  maximum.           It is finally suggested as worthy of consideration, by  those of us  who  are  not  in favour of applying the decennial increases  to this class,  that not until 1956, when the last of such increases  takes  effect, will  the rate of contribution payable by a man under  the compulsory scheme be Is.-3d.,  the rate which we suggest should be paid from the outset by the initial entrant to the  new  scheme&quot;;          I have considered carefully the arguments advanced for and against the increases.   I would not willingly do  anything which would prejudicially affect  the finances of  the  exi sting- scheme .   If the rates of contribution proposed were  the  same  as those which are payable  under the existing scheme the  case  for imposing the increases would be  incontestable.    But,  in  view of the fact that the contributions which  will be  charged  from the outset under the new scheme  are at higher rates than  those
rwhich will he paid under the existing scheme, while the maximumrates of pension are the same under both schemes, I doubt whetherthe  anticipated difficulty will in fact arise.   I suggest that the popular view is more likely to be that the future increases havebeen compounded for in the higher contributions charged from the outset.   I am impressed by the argument on the other side that ifthere is ground for thinking that the proposed contributionscan  be increased, the interests of the Exchequer require thathigher contributions should be charged from the outset.          If the new scheme is to include decennial increases itwill be necessary, if charges of bad faith are to be avoided, thatthis increased liability in the future should be brought clearlyto the notice of every person who proposes to enter the scheme,but  this would almost amount to warning applicants that thescheme was not so attractive as might appear at first sight.   Ifthe  scheme is to have a reasonable prospect of success it is vital that the offer made should be clear and unqualified.          On a careful review of the whole position I feel boundto recommend that the new scheme should not include decennialincreases.     8.   Subject to the approval of the Cabinet being given tothe  introduction of a Bill to provide for the proposed schemeof voluntary insurance for pensions I propose to include in thesame Bill a clause to give effect to the promise already madeon behalf of the Government that steps will be taken to bridge the gap which at present exists between the school medical serviceand medical benefit under National Health Insurance  by providing that boys and girds shall become compulsorily insured for medical benefit only as soon as they take up employment afterleaving school, and I am negotiating with the British medical association on the question of  remuneration.
