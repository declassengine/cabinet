THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  August 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 232  (36).CABINET.PALESTINE SITUATION.                  CORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL SMUTS.              Memorandum by Secretary of State for the Colonies.    IN continuation of my Memorandum of the 26th August  (CP. 226 (36), Icirculate herewith, for the information of  my colleagues, a copy of a further message which I have received, through the  Office of the High Commissioner forthe Union of South Africa, from General Smuts, on the subject of the proposalfor a temporary suspension of immigration into Palestine.                                                 (Initialled)    W. O. G.  Colonial Office, Downing Street,         Augusts,  1936.Copy of Telegram to Mr. te Water, London, from General Smuts, Pretoria, dated                             Augiist 28, 1936.    FOLLOWING private and personal message for Ormsby Gore :          &apos;&apos; Renewed rumour  of strong  pressure on  you  to suspend  Jewsh    Immigration even before inquiry by proposed commission.  Such a step in    face of Arab violence would surely make impartial carrying out of mandate    in future most difficult and would raise doubt as  to British seriousness in    regard to policy of Balfour declaration and even  as to ability to maintain    law and order,  which  after all is most  elementary duty of Government.    Sincerely trust no such step will be taken, but that order and confidence in    Government will be restored at all  costs and not obtained  by dangerous    concession to violence.  Compromise with lawlessness in such very flagrant    case of defiance would come as a shock to outside world opinion and tend to    create very dangerous impression for Empire at a time when prestige is most    important.  For sake of British prestige as well as  Governments prestige, I    should be most sorry to see&apos; any tampering with immigration  issue.  Please    show this to Prime Minister, to whom also I make most earnest appeal not    even  to  appear to compromise  on policy to  which Britain&apos;s word  to a    persecuted people is deeply pledged.&quot;[13725]
