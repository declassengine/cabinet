Memorandum by the President  of the Board  of Trade.     I have recently received  the  Report by  the DepartmentalCommittee on Fixed Trusts  (Cmd. 5259), and I desire to bring before the Cabinet the question of obtaining parliamentary sanction for the Committee&apos;s recommendations.   A summary ofthe Committee&apos;s proposals  is annexed.     Recent years .have been marked by a notable growth inthe volume of investment in Fixed  and Flexible  Trusts, mostlyby the small investor..  The Committee estimate  that about 50,000*000 have been so invested.  At the same time this development has given rise to  some  public anxiety as evidencedby numerous Questions in the House  of Commons in recent months.The Stock Exchange set up  a Committee to examine the matter,but this body came to the  conclusion that action by the stock exchange could not be effective without legislation.  Inthese circumstances, after consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, I appointed a strong Departmental Committee inMarch last under the Chairmanship  of Sir Alan Anderson, M.P.,to enquire into Fixed Trusts in all their aspects.     The general conclusion of the  Committee is that the UnitTrust properly conducted offers the small investorfacilities which he did not previously enjoy for acquiring aparticular type of investment,  and  that.accordingly themovement is one which should be controlled but not prohibited.The Committee  expressed themselves  as against the setting up     *The Committee suggest the name of Unit Trust to cover         both  Fixed and Flexible Trusts..
 of an authority without  whose  licence Unit Trusts could not he formed or enlarged  and they proceeded to make a number of detailed recommendations for safeguarding the interests of the potential and  actual  investor.   The proposals are modelled generally upon the  existing statutory provisions for protecting the investor  in ordinary Companies so far as they are  applicable.  They include  registration and the obligation on the part of Management Companies  and Trustees to file detailed accounts and returns  with an official Registrar in order to enable the investor to  obtain information. Management  Companies  could be  required to make a substantial deposit  in  respect  of each Trust conducted by them;  this follows  the  precedent of the Insurance law.  Unit holders are also  to  be  given some voice in the control of the Management Companies  and  certain restrictions are proposed on their advertisements.  Recommendations are also made in regard to the  taxation of transfers, certificates, etc.      The  Report was unanimous.  A note was added by Mr, P.T/. Pethick^Lawrence *  M.P., containing the statement that  &quot;whilst I  concur with my  colleagues in the view that under present  circumstances it would be inappropriate to attempt to supervise and  control the investments of Unit Trusts, I regard this  decision as of only temporary validity&quot;.      The Report has been favourably received and early legislation is desirable.  The Bill should not be controversial although there may well be some discussion on the detailed arrangements.  Accordingly,  I ask for authority to have a Bill drafted  carrying out  such of the Committee&apos;s recommendations asneed legislation,  and to submit the Bill in due course to theHome Affairs Committee in order that the Bill may be introduced early next Session.   The proposals will need further  detailed examination by the Treasury and the Board ofTrade, but so far as possible I propose  to keep to the actual
recommendations of the Committee.  The Chancellor of theExchequer concurs&quot; in the action proposed.     In conclusion I would emphasise that there are certaindangers inherent  in the Unit Trust movement which will not heeliminated by the proposed legislation.  As the Committee pointout, the movement has prospered on the foundation of a risingmarket in securities and no one can foretell what will happen in times of depression.  The holders may demand re-purchase oftheir units and the management be compelled to realise the underlying securities at the wrong time.  There is no completeremedy for this short of suppressing the movement and, as pointed out above, the Committee do not favour such drastic action.  Meantime it is all to the good that these possibledangers have received and will receive public notice and thatunit holders should realise the true position of their investment.
