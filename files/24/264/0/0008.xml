August 1936.SECRET.                                   -                     Copy No.CP. 233  (36).CABINET.ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY IN  THE SPANISH CIVIL  WAR.              Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE  to the Cabinet a memorandum  drawn  up in the ForeignOffice on the question of Italian foreign policy in the Spanish civil wrar,  whichwas considered by the Committee on Foreign Policy at their meeting held onthe 25th August, 1936.                                                                   A. E.    Foreign Office, August 31, 1936.                               MEMORANDUM.    Italy is the only Great Power lying wholly inside the Mediterranean Basinand it is commonplace in Italian political thought that her future depends uponthe relative degree of sea and air power which she can exercise there as comparedwith other nations.  The most important limitation upon her exercise of military force  (in the wide sense  of the word) is the fact that of the three  gates  of theMediterranean one, namely, the Dardanelles, is commanded by Turkey and theother  two, namely, Suez and Gibraltar, by ourselves.   These circumstances had a relatively.small influence upon Italy&apos;s policy during the early period of her careeras an independent nation, during which she cheerfully acquiesced in a  situationwhich left her in a military sense at our mercy : the Great War and the Treaty ofLondon, however, gave a powerful impulse to her ambitions which the disillusion-ment of the  Peace Settlement did nothing to diminish.  In 1922 Mussolini came into power and from this moment onwards the efforts of Italy  to assert herself inone way and  another rise in a steady  crescendo marked,  among  other  things,by the Fiume incident, the Corfu incident, the acquisition and fortification of the dodecanese  and the construction of a first-class military base in the Island ofLeros; and terminating in the Abyssinian expedition which, we are now told, hadbeen the subject of Mussolini&apos;s dreams for fourteen years.  In parallel with theseevents which are matters of common knowledge an intensely active campaign ofintrigue of an anti-British character has been conducted by the Italians in north africa, Egypt, India, Arabia, Persia, Anatolia, Bulgaria, Albania and elsewhere.    Taking all this into consideration we can hardly avoid the supposition that italy  will regard disturbances in Spain not only as a struggle between Fascismand Communism, but also and primarily as a field  in which, by the exercise of activities  in line with the policy sketched above, she  might find herseif at onceable  to strengthen her own influence  and to weaken British sea power in theWestern Mediterranean.   Several recent Cabinet Papers on the British positionin the Mediterranean make it clear that this is a supposition which should give      8768   [13729]
 rise to the deepest misgivings.  The question is what steps, if any, can be taken to forestall the inconveniences and dangers which its realisation would open up, and the Chiefs  of Staff have been requested to consider to what extent British interests would  be affected and what  action they advise His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment should take in case Italy should by some means or another upset the existing balance in the Western Mediterranean.     It will be recalled that towards the end of the Abyssinian affair, the Govern- ment Were reproached not only by the  Opposition but by the Italian Government for  not having  made it  initially plain how strongly opposed we were  to  the conquest of Abyssinia by Italy. Though this reproach is unmerited, it may well be that Mussolini did not in fact properly understand the strength of our objections to his policy, and was not, unfortunately, sufficiently convinced  that we meant what we said.  Is it not possible that Mussolini might be tempted to take certain steps in the Western Mediterranean  calculated to &apos;&apos; upset the balance &apos;&apos;  there against which we should  be obliged to react even more strongly than we reacted against his Abyssinian policy steps  to which it would be quite impossible  for us to reconcile ourselves ?   And if all this be even possible, is there not now an even stronger case than there was in  the spring of 1935 for making it publicly plain that there are certain courses which, taken by Italy in the Western Mediter- ranean, might prove the source of  deep and enduring antagonism with ourselves 1     The  expedients  open to Mussolini for  securing  an  advantage  initially political but ultimately strategic  in the Western Mediterranean are numerous. If a Communist  Government  is established intense animosity against Italy may prevail in Spain  : Italians may be murdered, and the Italian Government might seize a  Spanish island as security for reparation.   Even if General Franco is successful his position may temporarily be very weak and  he might be tempted to enter into specially intimate political relations with Italy in return  for,  say, military supplies or technical assistance.  If the Communists are successful on the mainland and General Franco&apos;s party  maintains itself for the moment in Morocco, protracted hostilities must be expected in which the latter will be par- ticularly glad to seize any hand held out to him-at any price.  Whichever party is successful, it  is to be  feared that  the quiescence of Spain as  hitherto in international affairs will cease, and that she will continue to be what she has now become a focus for foreign propaganda and intrigue.  It is obviously impossible as yet to foresee in what manner, at what point, or by what stages the &quot; existing balance in the Western  Mediterranean&apos;&apos; might be threatened;  but if  the risk exists and we are to take any overt steps to  forestall the implied  danger to our- selves, it is clear that it will be better to give soon rather than late some indefinite but authoritative indication of what we consider to be the British interest in this part of the world.     The French  interest is clearly the safety of their African communications, which  depend in part  on British sea power.  There should,  therefore,  be no insuperable difficulty in securing French action in  parallel with  ours.  It  is difficult to suggest any useful action of the kind indicated  which we could take in the near future other than a public  statement by the Prime Minister or myself which, though discreetly worded, would be universally understood to be a warning by this country to others that we could  not remain indifferent to any alteration in the balance  of sea and air power in the Western Mediterranean, which was due, not to the action  of Spain within  her  own jurisdiction (a matter which  it is not open to us to question), but to the action of  some other Power which had taken advantage of civil war in Spain to enter into some kind of special relationship with either side.  If the idea of  making such a statement were  entertained,  it would be important that  we should make it before Italy had &quot;committed herself to any arrangement which was objectionable from our point  of view.   Prevention in a case like this would have much better prospects of being  successful than cure.    Whatever form  be taken by  the  agreement for  non-intervention which  we are trying to achieve, it may presently become desirable that the origin, scope and  purpose of such  an international  agreement should be briefly explained bysome member of the Government in a public  speech;  and, in the course of doing so, an opportunity would be presented  of indicating the kind of developments in the Western Mediterranean which would hardly  be tolerable for  us.   If the Italian Government do join in this agreement, and we have reason to think they will act up to their professions, this indication might be made in comparatively gentle terms.  If, on the other hand, they decided to stand out or we  had grounds
for thinking that their; professions were disingenuous, more emphasis could belent to it.  In any case, it seems not too soon to consider formula? which we mightuse in either event.    It is,  of  course, necessary, to bear in mind the necessity for npt  undulyantagonising Italy (or Germany) at this stage, when we are looking forward toa five-Power meeting at which their co-operation will be essential.   But it shouldbe possible to make some declaration, the sense  of  which will be  clear enough,while its wording can give no legitimate cause  of  complaint or offence to any individual  Government.   For that purpose it might be sufficient to use even sosimple and vague a formula as :           &quot;  Any alteration of the  status quo in the Western Mediterranean  must    be a matter of the closest concern to His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;
