( THIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY .QF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)                               CABINET,                     P.A7I,&apos;.?4Y (FREIGHT B353ATSg) BILL,                Merger andma by the Minister of Transport.SECRET,CP. 274(55).                                COPY NO.   4/ &amp;_         This is a short Bill consisting of one operative Clause anda Schedules the principles of which were approved by the Cabinet onthe 1st July last (cabinet 49(56) Conclusion 4).         The Bill is designed- to bring about the followingalterations in the Eleventh Schedule to the Local Government Acts1929:-  -   (1)   Relief of the railway companies from their obligation to         bear half of deficiencies arising&apos; in the Rebates pund and         provisions enabling the Fund to borrow the sum necessary to         enable it to repay its accumulated debt (approximately          10 millions) and to effect repayment of the loan by equal         annual instalments over a period of 15 years.   (2)   Concentration of 80 per cent of the reduced sum thus made         available on rebates on exported coal and 20 per cent on         milk and livestock.         As a result of  this concentration rebates will cease to beallowable during a period of seven years (which may by order beextended to fifteen years) on coal and certain ores for iron andsteel works3 pit props and a number of agricultural trafficssincluding manures? potatoes and various feeding stuffs.   ThemodjifTeations in the list of selected traffics have been agreed with  the various departments concerned.         it :1s proposed  that the companies should themselves beasked  to advance to the  Fund the sums necessary to enable it todischarge its obligations to them9 and by the Conclusion of July1st referred to above the Cabinet approved the suggestion that thecompanies might be asked to forego interest on any loan made by11
2S3them to finance the repayment from the Fund of the overpayments of rate relief during the past five years amounting to about  8-fnio net,,         In discussion the railway companies claimed that they areentitled^ at least in equity, to interest on the overpayments of rate relief in the past9 as well as on the proposed loan.   they pointed out that, during the years in which they were paying into theFund at nearly twice the rate now agreed as being their proper .liability,  they were experiencing a period of difficulty during whichmost of their shareholders had to forego any dividends0   At thesame time,  the Scheme makes no provision for the payment of interest on overpayments into the Fund and I do not anticipate that thecompanies will strongly press this claim if arrangements in other respects satisfactory to them are raade0   They have, however,stated that they would not voluntarily accept a solution whichdeprived them of interest (about  140,000 a year for 15 years) onthe loan.         It seems clear that the companies will offer strong opposition to any such proposal and it is not easy to discover any grounds on which it could be represented to parliament that, inorder to secure an additional -g-do a ton for export coal, it would beequitable to provide compulsorily that the sums ascertained to bedue to the companies should be repaid only by annual instalments andwithout interests         I may mention that the railway companies have pointed outthat they will have to pay income tax to the tune of about 2,300,000 on the sums repaid to them from the Fund,  and havesuggested that if the Government contributed to the Fund a sumequivalent to the increased income tax which would become payable bythe companies in respect of past years, the &quot;burden ef the interestpayable to them would be offset.         I understand that the Treasury,  after considering thematter, are unable to agree either that the income tax payable on
 the past overpayments into the Fund is of the nature of  a windfall to the Exchequer9 or that it constitutes an argument for sacrificing the amount involved for the benefit,of the Fund. ,   y  ,        /1n trie- e-ircuma t an c o c// I propose to endeavour to  conclude an agreement with the railway companies on the basis of their advancing the necessary sucis to the Fund at a low rate of interest 9 to be agreed with the Treasuryc   This arrangement need  not be embodied in the Bills but would have to be the subject of agreement in writing before the Bill is introduced.         As will be  seen from the annexed tables it is estimated that if interest is payable at    per cent a rebate of at least 5^dc a ton cnuld be  allowed on exported coal as compared with a present rebate of 8d. a ton.         Clause 1 of the Bills which has been drafted on these lines9  provides that the rebates on the new basis shall  come into force on the 1st january  1937 5 and that the Tribunal shall meet as soon as possible  after the passing of the Act to make the necessary adjustments.   The &quot;provisions relating to the alterations in the selected traffics are to continue for seven years  subject to extension by order of the . inister of  Transport up to a total period of fifteen years.    The necessary amendments in the Eleventh Schedule to the Local Government Act,  19293 are contained in the Schedule to the Billc    The amendment numbered 5 in the  Schedule enlarges somewhat the circumstances in which theMinister may issue a certificate under paragraph 11 of the original Schedule enabling the j?ribunal to spread any abnormal deficiency or surplus in the Fund with a view to avoiding undesirable fluctuation in the rates of rebate.         The Railway Freight Rebates Scheme is due for review by the Tribunal before the end of November and5  until the Bill becomes law3 nothing can be done towards putting rebates on a proper basis in relation to the resources and liabilities of the Fund.
33rd October,  19360I hope therefore that facilities will he given to enable theBill to he introduced as soon as parliament meets and passed thrthrough all its stages with the utmost despatch and, ifpossible, before the end of November.                        (initialled)   Lo H-Bo
