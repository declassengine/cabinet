EIS BRITAETNIO MAJESTY&apos;S government B I N EDTjCKET.                                                  COJ22LJIO.P.2 89 (56 )         TEE SITUATION IN MDRTirfR TYDVTL .                Memorandum by.-the Minister of Health                    and the kinister of Labour.                   We are concerned with the position at         Merthyr Tydvil, of which we think our colleagues should be         informed.   Its position can certainly be distinguished from         the other special areas and it appears to us to be in need  of         additional and immediate a3S.ist.ance.   At the present time         roughly 50^ of its insured persons are unemployed.   In the         last financial year the rate levied in Merthyr was 28/5d. in         the  . as compared with average rates of 20/lld. in Glamorgan,         2l/5d. in Monmouthshire and 18/- in Durham.   On the         1st January last, 1,123 per 10,000 of the population were in         receipt of poor relief, as against 639 in Glamorgan, 584 in        Monmouth and 763 in Durham.   The physical and psychological .        effects of this grave situation are becoming seriously        disquieting.    For the  first time it has been found by the        Ministry of Health medical staff that there is definite        deterioration,  and the  percentage of under and badly nourished        children has  risen in the last two years from 16-g- to 23  per        cent.    On the  question of food the  Medical Officers state that        &quot;as a  general  rule  meat is purchased in any quantity only at        the weekends  (l/6d.  or  2/- worth)  .....  we have  seldom seen        fresh  milk  in  the  households visited .....&quot;                  Bad local  administration is  not responsible  to        any large extent  for  *he  present  desperate  conditions, which        if  allowed  to develop may have  unfortunate  consequences.    The        recommendation  of  the recent Royal Commission would  involve        legislation terminating the  status of Merthyr Tydvil as a1.
County Borough and its merger in the County of Glamorgan,which would no doubt have to be accompanied by a subsidytowards Public Assistance, coupled with some central control which it would be most desirable to avoido        We press therefore very strongly that immediate consideration should be given to the establishment atMerthyr Tydvil of a Government factory for work under the rearmament Programme and adapted to the kind of labour whichis available in this districts,   We believe that,,  apart fromthe number of people employed, it would have a marked and immediate effect upon the moral of the population, of whomlarge&quot;numbers are today giving up hope and becoming all themore bitter as they see themselves destitute in the midstof returning and increasing prosperity in the country general        While we recommend that something on the lines we -propose should be done at once for Merthyr Tydvil, we feel it necessary to call attention to the  wider problem^  Thereis a heavy obligation resting on the Government,  in view ofthe new Unemployment Assistance Regulations, to leave nothingundone which we can do to provide opportunities for work forthe kind of labour available in all the hard hit  areas,  andthis is a question we must tackle in the near future,                              (Intldo)   K, Wo                              (Intld,)   E.Be27th Augustj  1956o
