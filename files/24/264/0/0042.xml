241.   The Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936 established a scheme ofunemployment insurance for agricultural workers on the lines recommended by theUnemployment Insurance  Statutory Comndttee.   That Committee had recommendedthat employment in horticixlture in a private garden should be excluded from thescheme unless and until the Minister should otherwise determine after further examination of the question.   The Act accordingly excluded private gardenersbut provided that the Minister should refer to the Statutory Committee thequestion whether it is desirable and practicable to include private gardeners in I                                                                                 Ithe scheme of unemployment insurance and empovirered the Minister, upon the receipt!of the Committee&apos;s report, to make a draft order malcing such amendments of theAct as he thinks fit for the inclusion of private gardeners in the agricultural  1                                                                                 nscheme to become operative upon an affirmative resolution by both Houses of                                                                                 IParliament.                                                                      I                                                                                 Hi2.   The question was referred to the Statutory Committee on 23rd April lastand the Committee presented their Report on 3rd July.   The Committee reportedunanimously that they had no hesitation in recommending that private gardenersshould be brought into unemployment insurance under the agricultural scheme.The Committee made every effort to collect the opinions of private gardeners andtheir employers, including a broadcast appeal for the expression of opinion.The opinions expressed to the Committee showed a great majority of the men anda majority of the employers in favour of the extension of insurance under theagricultural scheme to private gardeners.3.   The Statutory Committee anticipate that the general level of unemployment among private gardeners will be found to be a little below that assumed in thescheme of unemployment insurance for agriculture as a whole.   Consequently,their inclusion should not weaken the finance of the scheme^1.                                 CABINET.                        COPY NO.   lf-\(36).

4,   It is estimated that the number of private gardeners, affected may-prove to be some 125,000.   The Exchequer contribution under theAgricultural scheme in respect of this number will be rather more than 100,000 a year.   This should be more than offset by the saving to the *Exchequer as from 1st April 1937 of the cost of unemployment allowanceswhich  would otherwise have been payable to unemployed private gardeners.5.   I have no doubt that we should adopt the recommendation of theStatutory Committee and with the assent of my colleagues I propose to laythe- necessary draft order soon after the meeting of Parliament.   Asregards the date for commencement of -payment of contributions, I should aim at Monday 4th January, if Parliamentary approval of the necessaryresolutions can be obtained by the middle of November;  otherwise the datewill have to be later.   The terms of the draft order are under considers-.tion interdepartmentally.(intd.)  E.  B.16th October, 1936.H.Q.775 - 65.J.F.
