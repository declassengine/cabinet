This document is  the  property  of  His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government       0  \/Printed for the Cabinet.  September, 1936  SECRET                                                                COPY NO.   4 0,CP.  248 (36).THE CABINETPOWERS OF COMMAND  OF INDIAN COMMISSIONED                             OFFICERS      MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR WAR    1. In  his  Memorandum on  the Army  and Air  Force (Annual)  Bill of 1933   0164(CP. 68 (33)), the then Secretary of State for War acquainted the Cabinet with the&quot;  6266problem, which would  arise out  of the  process of Indianization, of the power of command to be exercised by the new type  of Indian commissioned officers over british officers and other ranks, both of the Indian Army and of the British Army in India.Lord  Hailsham said  that, as then advised, he was inclined to think that the problem could best  be dealt with by delegating authority to the Commander-in-Chief in Indiato give such powers of command as the situation might from time to time require, andthe matter was, in fact, dealt  with in this way.  The method of conveying power of command actually adopted, however,  is not that which was intended by the War Officeand  the  India  Office, and I think  it desirable to  acquaint  my colleagues with thecircumstances  in which the Secretary of State for India and myself have reluctantlydecided to  acquiesce in the instructions given by the then Commander-in-Chief in India(Field-Marshal Sir Philip  Ohetwode).     2. The difficult and delicate question  of regulating the powers of command, to beexercised by Indian commissioned officers  over British personnel of  the Army in India,formed the subject of exhaustive correspondence and discussion between  all parties concerned.   The Government of India had originally pressed for what may conveniently be described as complete reciprocity, involving the power of command by Indian officersover junior British officers and British other ranks, whether of the  Indian Army or ofthe British Army in India.  The War Office accepted the position that it was for theIndian Government to decide the mutual relations of British and Indian officers withinthe Indian Army, though  they were apprehensive of the effect of the proposals  on thesupply of  British  candidates  for commissions  in the Indian Army.   They could  not,however,  agree to the  Indian commissioned officer  being  invested  with  powers of command over  the personnel of the British Army in India except for purely temporary and local purposes.  Their proposal  was that such powers should be conferred  only incases where it is necessary to ensure  the effective discharge of station duties ; but  thiswas  considered too  restrictive  by  the   Indian  authorities, and  a compromise  was eventually arrived  at and expressed in King&apos;s Regulations in the following  terms  :          &quot; Such power  will be exercised  on such occasions  as  may be appointed by     the officer commanding the station, brigade, brigade area, district or command, or     by the C-in-C.  in India, as regards  such personnel  serving together under  their     command.&quot;     This regulation, with  a memorandum explaining its effect, was submitted to  and approved by His Majesty the King.     3.  The wording made it clear  that  power of command should be exercised on specific occasions,  and  the War Office and the India Office  accordingly  saw  with considerable surprise that  the matter was dealt with in  Indian Army Order  799 of1935 as follows :           &quot; H.E. the C.-in-C, under  the power conferred upon him by King&apos;s Regula-     tions  ... . is  pleased to order that Indian commissioned officers shall on all     occasions exercise power of command  in relation to personnel of the British Army     in India,  subject  to  any restrictions which may be  imposed as regards  such     personnel  serving together under their  command  by the officer commanding the     station, brigade, brigade area, district or command.&quot;
       4. Such an instruction  approaches the matter from a very different  angle  from  that intended by the War Office and the India Office, and while it cannot be said that  the action taken by  the late Commander-in-Chief  is inconsistent with  the wording of  King&apos;s Regulations, it is contrary to the plain intention both of the paragraph (since it  is now no longer necessary  or possible for subordinate commanders to  &quot;appoint&quot;  occasions for the exercise of power of  command) and of the parties concerned in the  preliminary discussions, as revealed in correspondence.  To protests addressed by the  Secretary of State  for India, after discussion between our Departments, the  Defence  Department of the Government of India has replied that the wording of the paragraph  in King&apos;s Regulations gives the  authorities  in  India full discretion  to confer  such  powers as they consider necessary as a  matter of practical administrative convenience ;  that the action taken by  the Commander-in-Chief  is consistent with the declared policy  of giving India every  possible  chance  of  developing her own  national Army on the  same  lines  as those of  the  self-governing  Dominions ;  and  that the administrative  difficulties involved  in appointment of occasions lor the exercise of powers of command,  as intended by the War Office, make the course taken by the Commander-in-Chief a  preferable one.i       5.- The Secretary  of State for India considers it politically impossible to withdrawj  or modify the Indian Army Order in question, and, although I am not persuaded thatI  instructions issued on the lines intended by the India Office and  the War Office would  have been either inconsistent with the declared policy of H.M. Government or attended  by  administrative difficulties for  the  Defence  Department,  I have agreed  that the  Government of India shall not be  pressed to take such action.  I report the matter for;  the information of the  Cabinet, however, as the  Army Order in question has been the  subject of some comment in the public press, and the arrangement approved by it  may  conceivably produce incidents which will be  the subject of Parliamentary enquiry.                                                                            D.  C.THE WAR OFFICE,     28th September, 1936.(836/81 70 9/36 W.O.P. 9878
