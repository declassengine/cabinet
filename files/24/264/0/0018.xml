BJ3 ORE T.C - P.; 845 (56)                                         COPY NO.  jjj &quot;hCABINET.THE SITUATION IN PALE3TIN] The Proposa 1^ to proclaim martial law in Palestine.     At the request of the Secretary of State for Air thefollowing letter sent by him to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies is circulated for consideration at the Meetingof Ministers to be held on September 18th at 10.30 a.m.                                            151h S eptembe r,  1936.             My dear Billy,                  I  nave read  the  draft  memorandum prepared in the             Colonial Office.    I  cannot be at the meeting on Friday,             though  of course  I  will be  represented.   I think,             therefore,  it may be  useful to you to have my views on             your paper and the  facts as they are available  to me.                  I  remain of  opinion that  the Cabinet  was right in             deciding in favour  of martial  law in Palestine.    Even if             the case for and  against were  evenly balanced,  I think we             have gone too far to  go back on this.   Wauchope has  told             Abdullah that martial law will -probably be declared at an             early date, and I gather he has said the sane to the             Supreme Moslem Council.     The press here  and no doubt in             Palestine also has  stated that that is our intention.   In             these Circumstances,  I think it would be regarded in             Palestine as a bign of weakness if  martial law  were not             declared.   But apart from  this, I  think tne case on  merits             for martial law is  strong.   We were all agreed in Cabinet             that the administration in  Palestine had been seriously             inconvenienced by the delay in bringing tne criminals to             justice, and by the very inadequate sentences imposed by             the civil courts.  If the  High Commissioner exercised his             power to pass an  Ordinance  giving power to military courts             to try  cases, it  appears doubtful whether  an appeal would             not lie to  the Supreme Court,  and in that  event  the Chief             Justice would have  an opportunity,  which on past experience             he would not be slow  to seize, of reversing their decisions             or reducing their sentences.    Moreover, I am advised that             if this power were  used it  would be necessary for a court             martial to  go through the interminable process  of an             ordinary court  martial in this country, which I  know  from             experience  involves writing a  volume.   I  am, therefore,             definitely  in favour  of martial law.-fit.  Hon.  W.G.A. Ormsby-Gore&apos;, M.P.Colonial Office,  Downing St re et, S.iJ.l.
     I  should, have thought there was some advantage  in not making the declaration of martial lav- in the firstinstance at any rate cover the whole of Palestine, hutconfining it to the areas in which the military forces are actively operating.   If this were done, civil courtscould hardly hold that there was not a state of war  inthe areas covered by the declaration::  but I would give full discretion to General Dill, after consultation withthe High Commissioner, to declare the whole countrysubject to martial law if he thinks that necessary.     I am definitely against  declaring martial law inTrans-Jordan in existing circumstances.    There is not a stateof war there.   There are no disorders,  no doubt because.thereare no Jews,  and the Amir is  behaving admirably,,   I shouldhave thought it was asking for trouble to declare in effectthat a state of war exists there;   and I  should have thought,moreover,  that If we attempted to  do so,  any court must.find that  there was no state  of war, and therefore no case for martial  lew.    I am confirmed  in this view by Wauchope&apos;sletter of the 8th of September.     -as regards the High Commissioner,  I v am clearly of opinion that he should not administer martial  law.    There must betransferred  to General Dill all powers necessary to makemartial law  effective both in its  operation and as a justifi-  jcation in face of the courts  if the declaration is challenged..But subject  to that, I see advantages in the High Commissionercontinuing to administer other departments;   and especiallyin his continuing to exercise his  full powers in Trans-Jordan.I know from  ray own experience how  great Wauchope!s influenceis with Abdullah;   and I think it  is very important to pre-serve that.    Moreover, the administration of Palestine and transjordan-Jordan is a great job in itself;   and if General Dillis forced to undertake the whole of that work, he will have little time  to devote to his  main  task of defeating the       .1rebels.                                                       1                                                              I      I think the Service Departments would have preferred    tan alteration in paragraphs 8 and  9 insofar as they represent their views;   but I understand you are circulating the paper  1in its original form,, and the Service Departments will beable to make their comments.                        Yours ever,(Sgd.)   SWINTON.
