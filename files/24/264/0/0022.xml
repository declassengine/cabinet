Copy No.  3CP. 247 (36).CABINET.THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA AND THE KING.    Memorandum, circulated by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    PROBABLY my colleagues saw the newspaper report that at the banquetgiven by the Government of the Union of South Africa on the 7th September tothe delegates to the Transport Conference, which has recently been meeting inSouth Africa,  General Hertzog proposed the following toasts of Heads of Statesrepresented at the Conference :     &quot;1. The King of the Belgians.    &quot; 2. The President of  France.    &quot; 3. His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and            Northern Ireland.    &quot; 4. The President of  Portugal.&quot;The Governor-General of Angola then proposed  the  health  of &quot; His MajestyKing Edward VIII, Sovereign of the Union of South Africa &quot; (see Annex A).    2.   The toast list is known to have been prepared by the Union Government,and publicity was given to the incident in  the press, both in South Africa (see annex B) and in this country.  No doubt it has also been widely reported in theother Dominions. In effect, the procedure amounted to :     (a)  An express adoption by the Union Government  at  a public banquet, at           which representatives of  foreign Governments  and the press were           present, of the theory of the divisibility of the Crown, which we and           at any rate certain other Dominions do not share.    (b)  The inclusion of the King as one in  a list of &apos;&apos; foreign &apos;&apos; Heads of States.    3.   I received a  further report  on. the incident  from the Acting UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in the Union, which I append as Annex  C.  I feltthat we could not allow  this action on the part  of the Union Government to passwithout comment, and I therefore instructed the Acting High Commissioner to see general Hertzog at once and explain to him the embarrassment which it is likelyto cause  (see Annex D).    4.   I have now received the Acting High Commissioner^ report on his inter-view with General Hertzog (Annex E) together with a report on the attitude ofGeneral Smuts (Annex F).   I should explain  that the Dr. Bodenstein referred to isthe permanent head of the External Affairs Department, whose strong Nationalistviews colour all the advice which he gives to his Ministers; Mr. Patrick Duncanis one of General Hertzog&apos;s Cabinet colleagues; Colonel Stallard is the leader ofthe Dominion party in the Union Parliament.    5.   I understand  that at the Governor-General&apos;s dinner given on  the15th September, the toast list was unexceptionable from our point of view.

    Telegram from the Acting  United Kingdom High Commissioner in the              Union of South  Africa, dated September 9, 1936.    No. 99.    At Government banquet to  the delegates to the Transport Conference on the7th September toasts were proposed to Heads of State as follows :  (1) King ofthe Belgians, (2) French President, (3) His Majesty the King, United Kingdomof  Great  Britain and Northern Ireland, (4) Portuguese  President,  (5) HisMajesty King Edward VIII, Sovereign of Union of  South  Africa.  First fourtoasts were proposed by the Prime Minister,  and each was followed by playingof appropriate national anthem.   Fifth toast was proposed by the Governor-General of Angola.   &quot; Dies Stem  Van Suid Afrika &quot; was played.   ColonelStallard got up and left the dinner table as a protest against above procedure.ANNEX B.    Telegram from the Acting  United Kingdom High Commissioner in the              Union of South  A frica, dated September 9, 1936.    No. 103.    My telegram No. 101 of to-day, paragraph 2.  To-day  Vaderland gives greatprominence to the new toast.  Captions read :  &apos;&apos; First toast to Sovereign of theUnion proposed.  Governor of Angola makes history.&quot;    Leading article recapitulates procedure and congratulates the Government,which &quot; has never taken any steps which do not tally with South Africa&apos;s rightsof independent decision,&quot; and  Department of External Affairs  &quot;on  completecorrect!tude of arrangements for this important function.&quot;  Translation followsby air mail.ANNEX C.Paraphrase of Telegram, from, the Acting United Kingdom High Commissioner           in the Union of South Africa, dated September 9, 1936.    No. 101.    Procedure described in my telegram No. 99 of to-day was subject of muchacid comment at the dinner itself.  Mr. Duncan commented to me as follows :&apos;&apos; Why on earth cannot they leave constitutional issues&apos; of this sort alone ?&apos;&apos;    Governor-General, I understand, sent for the Prime Minister next morning and remonstrated with him not on  constitutional grounds but on grounds thatto raise such an issue on such an occasion was embarrassing to British Governors :General Hertzog was, however, unrepentant.  I am also  informed that ColonelStaliard made representations to the Governor-General, and stated that certainAfrikaans  pro-Government  newspapers received definite instructions from thePrime Minister himself to make much of the new procedure.    This is deplorable example of mischief caused by the Secretary for external affairs. You will note &quot;King of United Kingdom &quot; was included in alphabeticalorder among &quot;foreign&quot; heads of State, and that General Hertzog proposed thetoast.    In English circles here impression made is lamentable : it is clear that all his  colleagues were  not consulted  by General Hertzog,  and that Bodenstein has again seized the opportunity of trying to incorporate the idea of the divisibilityof the Crown in precedents on which the Union will rely in future.  Deliberatenature of the move  is shown by the fact that I was consulted beforehand as totoasts, and said that I believed procedure  in  similar circumstances  elsewhere
would be  for healths of  foreign heads of States represented to be proposed by-Prime Minister in alphabetical order and the King&apos;s health to be moved by the senior foreign Governor.    I have had no opportunity of enquiring Smuts&apos; views but if instructed by you I could do so.   Meanwhile, Governor-General is to give dinner to visitingGovernors on the 15th September  after opening of Empire Exhibition whenquestion may again  arise and advice of his Ministers may be that procedure atbanquet should again be followed.ANNEX D.Paraphrase of Telegram to the Acting United Kingdom High Commissioner in            the Union of South Africa,  dated September 11,  1936.,    Important.  No. 85.  Secret.    Incident of  the  toasts  at  the Transport Conference Banquet.   We aregrateful to you for your full reports.    Procedure  adopted  by the  Union  authorities is,  I  feel, bound  to  be an embarrassment  to us here and  possibly  also  to  other  members of  the BritishCommonwealth,  since it can  hardly be construed otherwise than as an expresscommitment to a view of the  constitutional position of the Crown in the BritishCommonwealth which has not been generally  accepted  by its Members.   while we realise that divergent opinions may be held on the principle involved, we had understood that  it was generally accepted that no step would be taken  by any ofthe Governments concerned to put forward one particular  view in such a manner as to  prejudice the question.   For  this reason prior consultation would seem tohave  been  appropriate.  At  it is,  the incident seems bound  to  have reactionselsewhere, more especially as it happened at a function attended by representativesof Foreign Governments and also open to  the press.    In the case of banquets connected  with  conferences attended by foreign representatives,  normal procedure would be that the following toasts  should be proposed by the Chairman :     (1) &quot;The King.&quot;    (2) The other Sovereigns and Heads of States represented at the Conference           (in alphabetical order of countries  if mentioned nominatim).    (3) The-Conference.The third toast would be replied  to by the senior foreign  representative present.    You should, as soon as possible, see General  Hertzog  and explain  to him onthe above lines  the embarrassment which, I  fear, is likely  to result from the incident.   We very much hope that  he will feel able to adopt, at any rate pendingan opportunity  for consultation, the normal procedure indicated  above on any occasion which may arise in future.    If opportunity arises, after  you have spoken  to General Hertzog, there is noobjection to your speaking to  General Smuts in the same sense.(Personal.)    Strong objection is, of course, also taken to the inclusion of the King  as one in a list of &quot; foreign &quot; heads of States,  but we have thought it best to refrain from  expressly referring to this further point,  as this might confuse the issue.ANNEX E.Paraphrase of  Telegram from the Acting United Kingdom High Commissioner           in the Union of South Africa, dated September 15, 1936.    No. 109. Secret.    Your telegram No.  90 of the 14th September.  As instructed, I spoke to thePrime Minister yesterday afternoon and left with him  an aide-memoire basedon your telegram No. 85.
    He took the line that question whether the Crown was or was not indivisiblemust be settled on facts, and was not one for decision by Governments or ImperialConference.   The facts showed that there was undoubtedly a  &quot; King of SouthAfrica,&quot; and he insisted most emphatically that there was no other way in whichthe toast list could  have been framed.  He became somewhat heated and I was unable to make any impression on him.  Finally he said that it would be better for him to resign and hand over the country to the Republicans rather than go back on the attitude he had adopted.  I am sending a despatch by ocean mail.ANNEX F.Paraphrase of Telegram from the Acting High Commissioner in the Union of                  South Africa, dated September 15, 1936.    No. 110. Secret and Personal.    &quot;With reference to my telegram No. 102 of  the 9th September.  On SundaySir Herbert Stanley lunched with General Smuts and he tells me that the latterconfirmed that Dr.  Bodenstein did not show him  the toast list.  General  was extremely cross about the whole  incident and, in particular, at the inclusion ofHis Majesty amongst foreign heads of States, but said that nothing would makeGeneral Hertzog change his attitude as General  Hertzog had a &quot; bee in hisbonnet &quot; on the question of the Crown.
