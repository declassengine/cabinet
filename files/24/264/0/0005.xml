STATE OF TRADE -- JULY,  .1936.Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board  of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in somecases by statistical information from other sources)     OVERSEAS TRADE.   Imports in July at  68.7 m. were  7 m.more than in July, 1935.   About 60% of ,the rise was in food and raw materials.   Of the increase of  2.7 m. in manufacturedgoods  Ig- m. related to non-ferrous metal products, machinery and oils, etc , and  g- m. to iron and steel products.  Exportsof United Kingdom products ( 40 ra.) were  3.6 m. more, and re-exports ( 5m.) were  1 m. more than in July, 1935.     EMPLOYMENT.  The total numbers of unemployed persons onthe registers at 20th. July, 1,652,072, was 50,604 fewer thanat 22nd June.   The main variations were:-     London ____.. - 4,912      North Eastern - 37,910     South Eastern- 3,996      North Western -  5,985     Southwestern- 3,941      Scotland..... 4- 14,029     Midlands.....+ 3,013      Wales........ - 10,902                  -The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 inemployment was 10,895,000, 63,000 more than at 22nd June and481,000 more than at 22nd July, 1935.   .     Employment improved in. coal mining (following the increase-due to temporary causes in the numbers unemployed in June), thecotton, tinplate, electric cable etc.  industries,  the printing and book binding, transport and distributive trades,  foodpreparation and hotel and boarding house service.    Employmentdeclined in building and public works contracting and in the clothing trades (including boot and shoe manufacture)..     RAILWAY TRAFFIC.    In the four weeks ended 26th Julyrailway traffic receipts increased by   605,000 (4*78$)compared with the corresponding period of 1955.    passenger traffic increased by 2.72%,  merchandise,  minerals  and livestock by 5.66%,  and coal,  coke and patent fuel by  10.10$.
      SHIPPING.     The upward trend in freight markets continued.    The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 - 100)  was 88.42 as against 87.86 in June and 79.40 a year ago;  but the index numbers do not fully reflect the considerable  improvement recently as the result of renewed activity in the Plate and Par East markets.      BANKING.      Money was in ample supply during the first three weeks,  but was distinctly more usable in the last week of July.    The Treasury bill rate varied between 12/ld.  and 10/6d.    The  franc was steadier against sterling,  the spot rate fluctuating between 75f and 765/32 and the three months discount rate  between 2^/16  and 2^Vl6.    The New York rate was steady  around 5.02.    The Bank of England continued its purchase of gold;   market prices ranged from 138/7d.  to 139/ld. per ounce.    The Clearing Banks&apos;  figures showed increases of  14.6 m.  in deposits,   19 m.  in bills and  5 m.  in advances, and decreases  of  2 m.  in cash and  4 rn.  in  investments.      ENGINEERING.    Conditions further improved,  although there was a tendency towards a  rise in production  costs.    It  is practically certain that  current  activity will  be  maintained for the  rest of this year,  probably without  the  usual mid- summer  recession.    Exports of machinery were  valued at  3.9 m. as  compared with  3.4  m.  in July,  1935.      COAL.      The  average  weekly  output  of  coal  during the  13. weeks ended 25th July  was  4.2 m.  tons  as  compared  with 4.12 m. tons  in  the corresponding period a  year ago  - an  increase  of nearly 2$.   The  average number of  wage-earners employed was 1%  less  than a year before.    Exports  in  July amounted to 3.36  in,  tons as  compared with 5.63 m. tons in July,1.935.   There were  no exports  to  Italy as compared with 405,000  tons a year ago.   Other countries taking less  included Canada, Prance andArgentina;  the chief  increases were to Finland, Sweden and denmark.     MOTOR INDUSTRY.   The number of motor vehicles newlyregistered in June was 33,361 - 5,654 more than a year ago;
 the  increase  in private cars was 3,452.   Exports of new private cars  and chassis in duly amounted to 5,920 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,441 - 59$ and 15% respectively  more than in July, 1935.   457 complete new private cars and taxis were imported as compared with 500 a year ago.     LIGHT METAL IHDU3TRIES.  Most light metal trades continued &quot;busy.   Prices may stiffen before the end of the year as a result of wage increases.   There was-a slight decline in the home trade in enamelled hollow-ware, but export business was maintained.   In the architectural metalwork industry improvement slowly continues.   There are no signs of falling off in activity in the non-ferrous metals industry, though there may be a temporary slackening during the holiday season.     ELECTRICAL IHPUSTRY.   Activity increased contrary to the usual seasonal tendency.    The index of heavy engineering orders (for both home and export trades) was much higher than in June, 1935,   Consumption of electricity amounted to 1,403 m. units - 15% more than a year ago.    SILK AxMTJ ARTIFICIAL SILK,   The rayon yarn trade continued to improve and there was some improvement in the demand for staple fibre.    The underwear trade continued disappointing. Exports of yarns,  all-rayon fabrics and rayon mixture piece- goods were substantially greater than in July,  1935.    In spite of bad weather the rayon piece-goods trade has been moderatelygood this summer.     The silk trade was slack owing to the bad weather..- -  Theprice of raw silk rose and is expected, to remain firm.     COTTON.    There was  a substantial improvement,  contrary  to the normal seasonal tendency,  during July.    The rise In raw cotton prices continued to stimulate activity;   production andemployment increased and  there was a notable  increase in export9distributed over most markets.     Average weekly deliveries of  raw  cotton  to  spinners were
 27.4 m.  lbs.  against 26.5 m.  lbs*  in June and 25.4 m.  lbs.  in July,  1935.    Spot prices of  raw cotton reached the highest level since  1930-    Yarn exports at  13.3 in.  lbs-,  were  1  m.  lbs. h more than in June  and 1.4 m.  lbs.  more  than in July, 1935. Exports  of piece goods at 176 ra.  sq.  yds.  were 46 m. sq.  ydSo more than in June  and 6 m,  sq.  yds.  more than in July, 1935; India took 10^ m.  sq.  yds.  more than in June,  and other countries taking more included Australia,  South Africa,  British West Africa,  Argentina and  Egypt.      WOOL.    There was a further slight decline in the general activity of  the industry during July, particularly in  the worsted  section.    Exports  of tops,  yarns and tissues however increased as  compared with  June.   Raw  wool  prices tended to harden.    In  the woollen section there  are rather more enquiries than was the case a month  ago,  but the  outlook in the worsted  section is not encouraging.     HIDES AW LEATHER.   Early in July the  hide  market  was steady but quiet,  but  later increased demand arose and prices advanced very considerably.    In  the leather industry there was oh the whole  an increase in activity although experience  varied greatly  between different sections.,     POTTERY.   Demand in June  was maintained  in  the china ware, glazed wall and hearth tiles,  and  sanitary ware of earthenware trades.   The  improvement in  orders for  electrical ware continued, but there was no improvement  in the demand for general  earthenware.    The  demand for sanitary fireclay was good on the whole, a slight  decrease in housing demands having been offset by better public works contracts.     RETAIL TRADE.    The money value of  retail sales in june was 4.7% greater than  in June 1935.   Sales  of food andperishables rose by 8.-5^, but  of other merchandise by only O.S^eThe smallness of the latter rise was probably due  to the incidence of Whitsuntide and the bad weather in June.Preliminary figures for July appear to be somewhat better.                         -4-
     CANADIAN TRADEo  Economic conditions further improved in June and industrial production expanded,  Exports as awhole, while less  than in May, were considerably more than inJune, 193i,  Compared with the previous month exports of copper, zinc and wood pulp and shingles declined, while exportsof asbestos, nickel, bauxite, and planks and boards increased,,Imports of ravf cotton and yarn decreased, but wool, rubber and petroleum imports increased,     AUSTRALIAN TRADE,  2,83 m. bales of wool were receivedinto store in the year ended 30th June as compared with 2,91 m,a year before, the quantity sold or shipped being 2*76nuand 2,82m,respectively,.  Wheat and flour shipments from 1st December to28th July were equivalent to 71.7 i, bushels of wheat as against72ol &apos;m, a year ago.  Butter shipments in July were larger thana year ago.  Imports of merchandise during June amounted to 8,38 m, (Australian currency) as compared with  6,9 m, a year before,     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE,  Activity in mining construction,manufacturing and trade generally continued to expand.   imports in May were 6*7% greater than in May, 1935,   Exports (excludinggold) were 104$ more despite a decline in wool shipments and a virtual cessation of maize shipments.  Both output and  exportsof gold were greater than a year ago,     INDIAN TRADE,  Imports in July were 10,08 lakhs of rupeesas compared with 9,79 lakhs in June, and exports 14,42  lakhsas compared&apos;with 13,46 lakhs.   Heavy rain has fallen in mostparts of India and crops are reported to be in satisfactorycondition, except in the United Provinces,   The final forecast for the year 1935-36 for the wheat crop is  9,435 m, tons ascompared with 9,728 m,  tons a  year ago,     SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE,     Argentina,  Grain markets were active.   Wheat and  linseedprices advanced substantially, but Argentina will not benefit
greatly until the new crops begin to move.  The drought in north America has resulted in much higher prices for maize;but some of the Argentine crop is of poor quality and will notfetch best prices0  In spite of unfavourable export figuresfor the first half of 1935 (due to the failure of certain oflast season&apos;s crops) and of the obscure political outlook,reports are optimistic,  The exchange value of the peso hasimprovedo     Brazilc.  The surplus of exports over imports in the first five months of 1936 was considerably less than a year beforeowing in part to a large expansion of imports in MayoShipments of coffee in the 1935/36 season were 19 per centolarger than a year before;  the statistical position- duringthe current season is not likely to change greatlyo     Chile,  Exports in January-May 1936 were 18-g$  and imports21% more than a year before,,   The shortage of exchange to pay for imports from the United Kingdom and the United Statescontinues acute,     Peru,   Overseas trade figures for the first five monthsshow a satisfactory increase over the corresponding period oflast year,  but the favourable balance of trade was slightly lower,     Colombia,  A system amounting to direct Government controlof imports  (through the Exchange Control Commission) has been instituted.  The rate of imports of United Kingdom goods ispractically equal to the average of the years 1923-1929 andthree times that of 1931-1932,     Uruguay   Wool exports for October 1935 - June 1936 wereappreciably greater than during the corresponding period ofthe previous season,     Venezuela^:  Conditions improved, although there was a continued shortage of foreign exchange;   there was a gooddemand for  consumers&apos;  goods,
