Copy No.CP. 235 (36).CABINET.PALESTINE SITUATION:  NURI  PASHA&apos;S ATTEMPT  AT                         MEDIATION.             Memorandum by Secretary of State for the Colonies.    IN continuation of my previous paper,  CP.  No. 227 (36),  I now circulate herewith copy of further telegraphic correspondence with Sir Arthur Wauchope,with regard to Nuri Pasha&apos;s attempt at mediation in the Palestine dispute.                                                 (Initialled)     W. O.  G.    Colonial  Office, downing  Street,         August 31, 1936.                                    (1)      Cypher Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the                            Secretary of State.                         Dated 27th August, 1936.                  (Received 2-43 A.M. 28th August, 1936.)    MOST Immediate.  No.  655.  Secret.    Addressed to Colonial Office, No. 655.  Repeated to Bagdad, No. 985.    My telegram No. 651.    At the request of the Supreme Arab Committee, who, I am informed, have accepted  his proposal of mediation, Nuri Pasha returned  to Palestine  to-day.He confirmed the view expressed in paragraph 4 of my telegram under referencethat  his  intervention, otherwise than as Foreign Minister of Iraq, would havebeen, quite valueless.  He tells me that he found  that Arabs had completely lostfaith in the good intentions of His  Majesty&apos;s Government and feared that any recommendation  of the  Royal Commission favourable to Arabs would be rejected by His Majesty&apos;s Government under Jewish pressure.   The only way that hecould see of ending the deadlock was to promise that Iraqi Government wouldwatch over the interests of obstructing Arabs of Palestine during the next fewmonths and would use such influence as they had with His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin effecting as counterweight to influence of Jewish diaspora.  He is convincedthat  nothing less than formula set out in the draft memorandum (text of whichwas given in my  telegram No. 638) would suffice to induce the leaders to  call offthe strikes and  disorders, and that to qualify the words  &quot; good  offices &quot; in clause 2  (which  should more properly  have  been translated &quot;mediation&quot;) byword &quot; informal &quot; would render memorandum unacceptable to Arabs.      [13730]                                                    B
     2.   He has, however, no intention of arrogating to the Iraqi Government any permanent or general right of mediation on behalf of Arabs of Palestine nor of doing more-than give general support to their, case before the Royal Commission and in London and Geneva after that body submits its report.   My immediately following telegram gives  proposed text of a letter  which he agrees might be addressed to him to clarify the position, and which as Foreign Minister he would, subject to the concurrence of his  Government, accept setting out the limits of Iraqi mediation; it could then, if  thought desirable,  be published.     3.   He made it clear that he has not wished to intervene and is only trying to help.  He is, however, convinced that nothing less than his proposal will achieve the end desired unless His Majesty&apos;s Government are willing to suspend immigra-: tion before disorder ceases.  He can see no other way of bringing the disturbances to an end without prior concessions by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   If, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared  to accept his mediation on the  lines proposed he will most  willingly  withdraw  from  the picture.   He must leave Palestine for  Angora not later than 30th August.     4.   He says that he, like all  Arabs in Palestine, interpreted your reply in Parliament of 22nd July as meaning that immigration would be suspended after order  was restored,  and it  was only in  this  just belief  that he had offered his mediation since  he  considers suspension of immigration the  only gesture likely to restore Arab confidence in His Majesty&apos;s Government.     5.   If Nuri&apos;s  efforts now  fail on the grounds that His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment cannot.accept representations from Iraqi Government, the chances of an early end to the disorders  will be very remote.  I  am convinced that the bulk of the Arabs wish for peace, but, believing themselves to be in a desperate plight, are perfectly ready to continue the struggle  unless they receive a  tangible sign of goodwill from His Majesty&apos;s  Government.                                     (2)  Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State.                          Dated 27th August, 1936.                   (Received 2-58 A.M. 28th August, 1936.)     MOST Immediate.   No. 656.     Addressed to Colonial Office, No. 656.  Repeated to Bagdad, No. 986.     Following is text of proposed letter :       Begins:  His  Majesty&apos;s Government have taken note of the terms of thememorandum  which  Nuri  Pasha-al-Said,  Minister  for Foreign  Affairs, hasaddressed to the Supreme Arab Committee, and with reference to clause 2 thereofunderstand  as follows :      1. That the mediation of  the Iraq Government proposed would be on thebasis of strong friendship existing between  Great Britain and Iraq,  and wouldnot imply in the case of  the Iraqi Government any claim to intervene generally inthe affairs of Palestine.     2. The  mediation contemplated by  the Iraqi  Government  will  consist in(a) making  certain friendly suggestions to His Majesty&apos;s Government designedto promote  good feeling in Palestine,  when the Arab Supreme Committee has succeeded in ending the  strike and all  disorders; (&amp;)  submitting  through the-agency of Nuri  Pasha-al-Said  to the  Royal  Commission evidence bearing  uponArab grievances; (c) when Royal Commission has reported, submitting in a spirit-of friendship  their views  to His Majesty&apos;s Government  in regard to such of therecommendations of the  Royal Commission as concern the future well being of theArabs of Palestine; (d)  when Royal Commission^ report comes before the Leagueof Nations, in their capacity  as a State Member of the League, using  their influence to  support the  recommendations of  the Royal&apos; Commission.

     Cypher Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the                             Secretary of State.                         Dated 28th August, 1936.                   (Received 3 - 53 P.M. 28th August, 1936.)    MOST Immediate.  No.  657.  Secret.    Addressed to Colonial Office, No. 657.  -Repeated to Bagdad, No. 987. -    I am indeed grateful for your telegrams No. 437* and No. 438*    I have consulted Nuri Pasha.  He fears that any alteration of the  text ofthe memorandum (given in my No. 6381&quot;) would at this late stage create suspicionin the minds of the Arab  leaders with whom it has&apos; been discussed and give riseto possibly insurmountable difficulties  just at a moment when he feels success isalmost assured.  I agree with him as to the  danger of altering the original text.Both he  and I would therefore  much prefer to retain the original text of thememorandum unaltered, but supplemented  by  explanatory  and limiting letterthe proposed text of which was given in my No. 656.   He would not in the last resort  object to amendment  of the wording  of that letter if the form is open to criticism, provided that  substance  and  statement of  the Iraqi  Governmentsintended actions were left unaltered.  I strongly urge that this course of retaining the original text of the memorandum  unamended and explaining its scope witha letter  (which could be published) on the lines  of that proposed in No. 656should be adopted if in any way possible.    2.   If,  however, this course is  considered   wholly  unacceptable  by  HisMajesty&apos;s Government, then he  will do his best to induce the Arab  leaders toaccept  the  revised memorandum given in your No. 438, subject,  however, to  asmall addition and alteration to clause 2 which both he and I consider absolutely essential.    3.   The following is proposed amended text of clause 2 : -    Begins: (2) When this has been done to use their good offices with the BritishGovernment first, in regard to immediate measures to promote good  feeling inPalestine, and  then  in regard to such measures as the Royal Commission mayrecommend for meeting legitimate demands of Arabs of Palestine arising out ofthe disturbances.  Ends:    4.   The &apos;&apos; immediate  measures &apos;&apos; contemplated by Nuri are, I understand :(1)  clemency, which  is within  my prerogative, toward rebel bands who returnpeacefully to their villages and towards minor offenders; and (2)  the temporary suspension of  immigration on which I  shall  make  no  statement  till  youauthorise me.    5.   I presume that words between  &apos;&apos; such &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; mediation &apos;&apos; in your No. 438should be &quot;formal&quot; and not &quot;informal&quot; as it was received.    6.   I feel that time is  now the essence of success, and  therefore I hope that  Imay have an immediate reply to this telegram.                                    (4)   Cypher Telegram from the Secretary of State to the High Commissioner for                                Palestine.                     (Sent 12-15 P.M.  29th August, 1936.)    MOST Immediate.    Addressed  to High Commissioner.  Repeated to Ambassador, Bagdad,  forhis personal and confidential information.    Private and Personal.    Your telegram No. 657 is under urgent consideration and reply will be sentas soon as possible.  Meanwhile,  pending Cabinet meeting on 2nd September.            * (8) and (9) in CP. 227  (36).  .................  f (4) in CP. 227 (36).

when, as you are aware, whole Palestine question will come up for consideration,it is essential that nothing  should be said that would in any way commit HisMajesty&apos;s Government,  or could be regarded by Nuri  or  Arab leaders  as com-mitting  His. Majesty&apos;s Government in  any way to temporary  suspension  of immigration.                                    (5)   Cypher Telegram from the Secretary of State id the High Commissioner for                                 Palestine.                     (Sent 2-35 P.M. 29th August, 1936:)    MOST Ihiiriediate.    Addressed High Commissioner, No. 445.  Repeated to Bagdad, No.- 169.    Your telegram No. 657.  Regret that owing to necessity for consultation with my colleagues it is impossible to let you have considered reply before Monday, and final reply may have to be deferred until after Cabinet meeting on 2nd (September.Meanwhile, I hope that it is clearly understood that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould in  no  circumstances  agree  to  last eleven  words of  Nuri&apos;8 originalmemorandum quoted in your telegram No. 638, which, in their view, could riot feereconciled with Mandate.                                    (6)    Cypher Telegram  from the High Commissioner for Palestine  to  the                             Secretary of State.                         Dated 30th August,  1936.                  (Received 10-40  P.M. 30th August,  1936:)    MOST Immediate.    Addressed to Colonial Office, No. 664.  Repeated to Bagdad, No. 990.   Secret.    Nuri  Pasha left  Jerusalem this morning for Constantinople.  He has promised to return if  needed at short  notice.   Before he  left  Supreme ArabCommittee passed a resolution unanimously accepting Nuri Pasha&apos;s mediationand undertaking to endeavour to obtain agreement, within the  next few days,  oflocal national  committee.  They have promised him orally meanwhile to do their utmost to reduce acts of violence.    Nuri  Pasha assures me  that from  the  beginning  he riiade  it clear to theCommittee and  to all  leading Arabs  with whom he has spoken that his draft memorandum had not been approved by either His Majesty&apos;s  Government or IraqGovernment, and he was not in a position to say whether they would accept  it    Nuri  was told on  27th August that his memorandum in  its original formwas  unacceptable  to His Majesty&apos;s Government.  But he still  hopes, as do almost earnestly, that without alteration of its text it can be made acceptable  bymeans of  explanatory  letter, such  as. that in my telegram No. 656, which,  ifconsidered preferable,  could, he hoped, emanate from him and not from therepresentative of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as suggested in paragraph three ofmy telegram No. 655.     Nuri Pasha assures me that in spite of reiterated demands frorii Arab leadersfor a definite  assurance that immigration  will be suspended, he has always saidthat neither he  nor, he was sure, I myself,  was in a position to give any suchassurance.   All  that he could say  was  that  unless disorder stopped there wasno hope of suspension,  but if they stopped he believed that there was a good hope.     Before leaving he  asked me to convey bri his behalf a personal appeal to you,
                                     5  rwho know and understand the Arab&apos; mentality.  He said the Arab leaders havedefinitely,  however foolishly,  committed themselves to continue the strike  and -by implication disorders until immigration is stopped.  Every Arab: knows  this and if the leaders were to attempt  to call off the strike without first obtainingsuspension of immigration not only would their lives and the lives of any who obeythem be in jeopardy from extremists  and from fanatical bands roving the country.It is only by introducing the  new factor(s) of Iraqi mediation ((corrupt group)His Majesty&apos;s Government to  no more than listen to Iraqi representations, whichcould and would have been submitted in any case) that it is possible to extricatethe  Arab leaders  and Arabs  of  Palestine generally  from hopeless position inwhich  they have involved themselves.  It is not a matter merely of saving  facebut  of saving many lives.   He asks you  to  consider whether it is worth whilesacrificing the life of a single British  soldier to what he submits is a primarilyformal objection.     I should like  to associate myself  with Nuri&apos;s appeal.  Knowing Arabs ofPalestine and atmosphere  of  bitter determination which prevailed when Nuriarrived and also division and  jealousy  amongst the leaders,  I  am in a position to judge dispassionately the (corrupt group) work which he  has  done.     If  now we  cannot  take advantage  of  his  achievement, the  situationthroughout Palestine will become most  serious, and will require additional troops to control  (see my personal  letter to you of 29th August).&apos;     I hope that you will not  cast aside his great contribution to peace and  willweigh the prospects of a peaceful issue from present critical  situation and hopeit offers (?) at last a contented population accepting a just and  lasting solutionagainst formal objections to interference  by Iraqi Government which is  strictly limited both in scope and in time.                                    (7)Cypher Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of                                   State.                         Dated 31st August, 1936.                   (Received 2-40 A.M. 31st August, 1936.)    IMMEDIATE.   NO. 666.    Addressed to Colonial Office, No. 666.  Repeated to Bagdad, No. 991.    Supreme Arab Committee to-day issued a manifesto text of which is givenin my immediately following telegram.  The mention of &quot; mediation of the IraqGovernment &quot; refers to Nuri&apos;s  original memorandum, which he  informed  theCommittee had not been approved by either His Majesty&apos;s Government or the IraqGovernment.    In order that you may understand the true significance of reference to ArabKings and Amirs, I should explain that the intention of Nuri, as clearly stated tome, is that Arab rulers should only be invited to associate themselves with Ghaziin appealing to the Arabs of Palestine to cease strikes and disorders, possibly atthe  same time expressing confidence in the benevolent intentions of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment,  and that  Arab rulers should neither promise to  take, nor, in fact,take, any  mediatory action vis-a-vis His Majesty&apos;s Government thereafter.  Forthis reason and  in order  to prevent any misunderstanding, approach to Arabrulers is specifically left to Nuri (see third sentence of manifesto).    Intention of Arab  leaders, after preliminary period of canvass, during whichthey will  exert their influence to reduce disorders to obtain, agreement of. localcommittees to Nuri&apos;s  proposals of mediation, and  then, on his  return from constantinople, to call  off the strike and disorders. Many of the local committees have already been sounded, with  satisfactory results.
Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State.                          Dated 31st August, 1936.                    (Received 3-7 A.M. 31st August, 1936.)     IMMEDIATE.     Addressed to Colonial Office, No. 667.   Repeated to Bagdad.     Following is text of manifesto :      Begins: The  negotiations  between  Supreme  Arab  Committee  and  hisExcellency Nuri Pasha Es Said, the Foreign Minister  Iraq, have continued forseveral days during which all questions relating to the  Palestine(an) (and) Arabcases have been  discussed in atmosphere full of confidence and frankness.  Theresult has been full understanding and confidence in mediation of Iraqi Govern-ment and their Majesties and Highnesses the Arab King and the Amirs.     Consequently, his Excellency the Iraqi Minister will carry out the necessaryofficial communication as regards this subject.     At the same time the Supreme Arab Committee will bring this matter to thenotice of nations through National Local  Committees  in a general congress to-take its opinion and secure its approval.     The  nation  will continue its complete strike  with same perseverance and confidence by which it has been known in a proud manner, steadfast in its faith,patience  and dignified until these negotiations will arrive at the much desiredresult which will preserve for this brave nation its existence and will  secure itsrights and lead it to attain its aims. Ends.
