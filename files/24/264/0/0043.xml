[C 8684/4/18]                    No. 1.Correspondence  arising out of the communication  to  the French, Italian and    Belgian Ambassadors and to the German Charge d&apos;Affaires on September 18,    1936, of  a  Memorandum by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in  the  United    Kingdom  on the A genda of the Five-Power Conference.                                  No. 1.                      Mr. Eden to Sir G. Clerk (Paris).(No. 1587.)Sir,                                     Foreign Office, September 18,  1936.    I ASKED the French Ambassador to come and  see me this afternoon.  I told him I had  been considering the situation created by the replies  which wehad received to  our suggestion of  a meeting of the Powers  in London towardsthe end of next month.  It had, of course,  never been our intention to  have sucha meeting without adequate preparation, and in the circumstances I thought itwould be wise to set that diplomatic preparation in motion  as soon as possible.Last night the Ambassador had given Sir Robert Vansittart a copy of a paper containing the views of the French Government, but  this, as I understood it, was for us alone, and not for communication to  other Governments.  The Ambassadorconfirmed this, adding that the French paper  would be found  to go into theproblem  somewhat deeply.   Meanwhile,  I continued,  in  order to  facilitateprogress, I wished to give the Ambassador a memorandum, which I was alsohanding to the other interested Governments who had  accepted the invitation tothe. conference, containing the proposals of our  Government which  we thoughtwould facilitate  diplomatic progress.    2.   His Excellency looked through the memorandum and noted that several of the  points  raised were also included in the  French memorandum.  On thewhole, he thought  that the  procedure we proposed was probably the best in thecircumstances,  but how long did I think  it would take?   Would it mean an indefinite  postponement  of the conference ?   I replied that His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment very much hoped not, that was why we had immediately followed up our suggestion of  a date with  an actual  memorandum intended to  facilitateprogress through the diplomatic channel.  I did not see why these questions couldnot be answered  in, say, a week or ten days, during which time most of us wouldbe absent at Geneva,  and that on our return, if we had the necessary material  inthe replies, we  could consider the next step  to be taken.   The Ambassador agreed.    3.   I explained to the Ambassador that this document was for the confidential information of his Government, and  was not for publication.                                                 I  am, &amp;c.                                                     ANTHONY  EDEN.                                Enclosure.[C 6259/4/18]                              Memorandum.    HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have the honour to putforward the following suggestions as to the scope of the discussions which it ishoped to initiate in London between the five Locarno Powers at the earliest datethat may be agreed between them.    2.  It will be  recalled that in the words  of the London communique of the23rd July, 1936, the first business to be undertaken at such a meeting was to bethe negotiation of  a new agreement to take the place of the Treaty of Locarnoand to resolve,  through  the collaboration of all concerned, the situation created by the  German initiative of the 7th March.  The communique continued that ifprogress could be made  at this meeting, other matters affecting European peacewould  necessarily  come  under discussion.  In these circumstances it  would benatural to-look forward to the widening of the area  of the discussion in  such a
manner as to facilitate, with the collaboration of the other interested Powers, thesettlement of those problems the solution of which is essential to the peace ofEurope.    3.  On the 31st July both, the German and Italian Governments pointed out&apos;that this conference would require the most careful  diplomatic preparation.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government entirely share this  view, and  they are inclined to thinkthat,  arising in particular out of the discussion of the proposed agreement toreplace the Locarno Treaty, there are a number of points to which the attentionof the five Governments might well be now directed and which might profitably bediscussed by them, in advance of the meeting, through the diplomatic channel.    4.  Though the following list must certainly not  be regarded  as in any wayexhaustive, these points seem to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be as follows :     (1) What is to be the  form of the new agreement to take the place of the          Treaty of  Locarno,  i.e., will it include (a) non-aggression arrange-          ments between certain Powers, and, if so, between which Powers; and          (b) provisions guaranteeing those  non-aggression arrangements,  and,          if so, which Powers will give and receive the guarantees and how will          they operate?    (2) Will it be necessary to  make special provision in the new  agreement for          air attack?    (3) Should  the  new  agreement  contain  provisions for  arbitration  and          conciliation, as does  the Treaty of Locarno 1    5.  On these points the views of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  are, generally and provisionally,  as  follows :     (1) His Majesty&apos;s Government assume that the new agreement will  include          certain non-aggression arrangements, whereby the participants would          agree in no case to attack or invade each other by land, sea or air, or          to resort to war against each other, subject to certain  exceptions on          the lines which were laid down in article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno.          His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  would  be  ready  to guarantee  the          observance of such arrangements as between Germany on the one hand          and France and Belgium on the other, in  return for similar guarantees          for  the United  Kingdom  from France  against  Germany and from          Germany against France.   The  question whether  the  above  non-          aggression undertaking has been violated should,  in the opinion of          His Majesty&apos;s Government, be submitted to the Council  of the League          of Nations.  In the case of a  flagrant  violation of a frontier, the          guarantees might operate immediately, as in the Treaty  of Locarno,          pending a  final pronouncement by the Council.    (2) His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that special provision should be made          in the guarantee arrangements under the  new agreement  for immediate          assistance  in the event of an air attack which constituted a violation          of the non-aggression undertakings.  If this is done, a separate Air          Pact would not,  in their opinion, be necessary.    (3) His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  suggest  that  the new agreement  should          contain provisions for arbitration and conciliation as did the Treaty          of Locarno; and for their  part  they would be ready to  agree  to such          provisions.    6.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad  to  receive, either in writingor orally, the observations of the French  Government on these and any other points which they may think it useful to mention.    7.  A similar communication has been made to  the Belgian, German  and.Italian Governments.    Foreign Office, September 17, 1936.[13948]

I ASKED the Belgian Ambassador to come and see me this afternoon, when told him that we were anxious to make progress  through the diplomatic channelwith the preparations for the Five-Power Conference,  and handed him a copyof the enclosed memorandum.^)  His  Excellency thanked me and, having readit, remarked  that it seemed  a good method  for making a start with  the workwhich  lay in front  of us.   He asked me how soon His Majesty&apos;s governmenth oped to have a reply.  I told him that we should all be going to Geneva shortly,and that I thought  that if we could have replies in about ten  days, that  wouldfit in very well with our programme of work.    2.  I explained to the Ambassador that this document was for the confidential information of his Government, and was not for publication.

Phipps (Berlin).(No. 1081.)Sir,                                    Foreign  Office, September 18, 1936.    I ASKED the German Charge d&apos;Affaires to come and see me this afternoonwhen I stated that I had been sorry to notice in the German press a tendency to regard our suggestion to fix a date for a meeting of the Conference of the five powers  as an indication that we were not going to make adequate preparationthrough the diplomatic channel.  This had never  been  our intention.  On thecontrary we had always realised and stated that  the conference would requiresuch preparation.   I could not help  feeling  that  there must have been  some misunderstanding in Berlin about this.  Prince Bismarck replied that he thoughtit possible that this was so, for he had reported in August after a conversationwith Sir Alexander Cadogan that our idea was to start the preparations throughthe diplomatic channel  and that when the  suggestion had come for the  fixing of the date Berlin had apparently considered that this idea had been abandoned and that they were being asked to agree to a date in advance of any preparation.    2.  I replied that in any event the matter would now be fully cleared upbecause  I wished to give to Prince Bismarck this afternoon for his Governmentand for their confidential  information  a memorandum which we had  prepared and by  means of which, we  hoped  to  facilitate progress with the diplomaticpreparation for the conference.  A copy of  this  memorandum is enclosed.(l)                 (!) See Enclosure to No. 1 above, mutatis  mutandis.[C  6854/4/18]                      Mr. Eden to Mr. Ingram (Rome).(No. 1074.)Sir,                                    Foreign Office, September 18, 1936.    I ASKED the Italian Ambassador to come and see me this afternoon, when stated that, as he would be aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious tomake a start with the negotiations in connexion with the proposed Five-power conference.  I wished, therefore, to hand him for communication to his Govern-ment a memorandum setting out certain proposals for this purpose. A copy ofthis memorandum is enclosed.^)  The  Ambassador glanced through it, and thenremarked  that these proposals would  serve to set the ball rolling.   He would communicate them to his Government.    2.  I  explained to the Ambassador that this document was for the confidential information of his Government and was not for publication.                                                 I am, &amp;c.                                                    ANTHONY EDEN.
24[G  6903/5/18]                     No. 2.  United Kingdom Delegate to the League of Nations to the Foreign Office.                             (Received  October 5.)(No. 103.)    THE United Kingdom  delegate to  the  League  of Nations presents  hiscompliments and, with reference to Geneva telegram to. the Foreign Office, No.  140of the 1st October (repeated to Paris, No. 32), has the honour to transmit a copyof the French text of the French aide-memoire regarding the proposed meeting in London of the five  Locarno Powers, communicated by M. Massigli on  the1st  October, 1936.    Geneva, October 2, 1936.                            Enclosure in No. 2.         Memorandum in Reply to the British Note of September 17.(Translation.)     The Government of the Republic have examined attentively the suggestionsput forward by the British Government regarding the object of the discussion onwhich, it is hoped to embark at London between the Five Powers signatory ofthe Treaty of Locarno.     2.  Like the British  Government, the French Government  desire that thediscussion on this question should take place at the earliest date on which thePowers signatory  of the Treaty  of Locarno can agree;  for however great thevalue they attach to the guarantees  resulting  for  them  from the assurancesPrince Bismarck carefully read the document through and said that he noticed that we  now suggested that the meeting should be in London at  the earliest date that might be agreed upon.  I  said  that  this was so and later in the conversation indicated to him that we still hoped that it  might be in the latter half of October.    3.  Prince Bismarck  then asked whether the second paragraph containednothing more than was in the London communique.  I said that this was so.  Hethen asked what was the point of the reference in paragraph 5, sub-paragraph (1),to exceptions &apos;&apos; on the lines which were laid down in article  2 of the Treaty of locarno.&quot;  I showed Prince Bismarck article 2 of the treaty and pointed out thatthe expression used in the memorandum was &quot; on  the lines which were laid downin article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno.&quot;  It was therefore open to his Governmentto ask for a definition of these exceptions.   I also  pointed  out that sub-para-graph (1) of article 2 began with the definition of  the right of legitimate defence,that is  to say, resistance to a  violation  of the  undertaking contained in theprevious paragraph. Prince Bismarck pointed out that this article 2 also referredto the demilitarised zone.  I replied that it had not been our intention to specifythe zone in this way in the new agreement, and again explained that if the GermanGovernment wished, to know what the exceptions were then it would be, of course,a very proper question for them to ask in the course of the diplomatic exchanges.Prince Bismarck also showed some interest in the other exceptions in article 2which dealt with action in pursuance of article 16 of the Covenant of the Leagueaud again as the result of a decision by the  Assembly or the Council of the Leagueor in pursuance of article 15, paragraph 7, of the Covenant.  He fully appreciated,however, that these were matters which could be further discussed in the courseof the diplomatic exchanges.    4   Speaking for himself, the German Charge d&apos;Affaires indicated that he agreed with the view that the Air Pact could now form part of any new arrange-ment which  would be arrived at. Finally, the Charge d&apos;Affaires stated that he understood that we should be glad to receive a reply from his Government as soonas was possible.                                                  I am, &amp;c.                                                     ANTHONY EDEN.
contained in the letters exchanged on the 1st April last between the two Govern-ments, which have been made public, they nevertheless consider the conclusionof a new treaty between the Five Powers to be essential for the pacification ofEurope.    3.  The German and Italian Governments having expressed the desire, whichthe British Government share, that certain points, in particular those which require consideration in connexion with the contemplated agreement to replace theTreaty of Locarno, should be discussed through the diplomatic channel before themeeting of the Powers in question, the Government of the  Republic, in order tocontribute at  once  to this discussion, and without prejudice to the questions towhich they reserve the right to draw attention subsequently, have the honour toput forward the following considerations with reference to the points raised inthe British memorandum.    4.  The French Government consider that the provisions of the Treaty of locarno  should be  maintained subject to the inclusion of the modifications and additions rendered necessary by present circumstances or which experience seemsto render desirable.    5.  Just as the Treaty of Locarno is based upon a guarantee of the territorialstatus quo resulting from the frontiers between Germany and Belgium and between germany and France,  and a guarantee of the inviolability of these frontiers, thenew agreement should be based upon the recognition of the fact that there  doesnot exist between the contracting parties any territorial dispute, and consequently,in their  mutual relations,  upon an individual  and collective guarantee of  theterritorial  status quo  as well  as of  the  inviolability of the frontiers of  their territories and dependencies.    6.  Each signatory would undertake vis-a-vis each of  the  other signatoriesnot to proceed to any attack or invasion by land, sea or air, and not  to resort inany event to force, without this impeding, however, the  exercise by one of  the signatory Powers of the right of legitimate defence, that is, of the right to oppose the violation of the obligation defined above.    7.  In case of failure to observe the obligation of non-aggression, assistance(the obligation to render which  must not be less extensive than that resulting fromthe Treaty of Locarno) should  be rendered by the other signatory Powers to thePower attacked.    8.  In reply to the question put by the  British  Government,  the  FrenchGovernment wish to declare at once that, subject to reciprocity, they are readyto contract the obligations of guarantee and assistance referred  to above towardseach of the Powers parties to the new agreement.    9.  The  means must be sought of ensuring the automatic working of  theprinciple  of assistance,  in satisfactory  conditions.  At  least  the  mechanismcontemplated by the Treaty of Locarno (article 4), which comprises, on the onehand, the recognition by the Council of the League of Nations of the fact that an act of aggression has taken place,  and, on the other, in the event of a flagrantviolation of the above-mentioned obligation, the  immediate  application  of  the guarantees pending the definite decision of the Council, should be maintained withthe necessary addition to forestall the danger of sudden early attack.    10.   It shall not  be possible for the benefits of this  new treaty (and,  inparticular, the obligation to  render assistance which results from it) to be invokedby a signatory Power  which fails to observe the obligations laid  down in it,  or which shall undertake in Europe something contrary to the territorial integrityor political independence of another Power, in particular by launching againstthe latter an unprovoked attack.  Consequently, the principle of assistance couldnot be brought into force against a signatory State which, in accordance with theprinciples of the Covenant of the League  of Nations, resists an act of aggressioncommitted by  one  of  the contracting parties  against  a State which is not a contracting party.   In laying down this principle, the Government of the Republichave in mind the provisions of article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno.    11.   The Government of the Republic agree with the British Government in considering that a sudden aerial attack should in a.ny case be regarded as a flagrantviolation  of  the  obligations  undertaken,  and  should  consequently  involveimmediate assistance by the other signatories to the State victim of the aggression.The stipulations regarding this might either form the subject of a special protocolor be  inserted  in the general treaty.  Whatever decision is reached,  the French
216Government  wishes to call  attention  to  the advantage of  completing  these obligations by obligations for the limitation of aerial armaments.    12.  As indicated in the arrangement concluded at London on the 19th March,1936,  technical  agreements  must be  envisaged,  for  purposes of  application,designed to  ensure, in case of  necessity,  prompt  action on the part of  the signatories, and to prepare suitable  measures to  render effective the obligationsundertaken.    13.  The Government  of the Republic remains in favour of the Treaties of locarno regarding the settlement of disputes by  arbitration or judicial methodsor by methods of conciliation; the conditions for the termination of&apos; these Treatieshave not been fulfilled and  consequently they are still in force.  It would be well to complete them by means of a promise of assistance in the event of one signatoryPower refusing to follow the procedures for pacific settlement thus laid down, orto give effect to the decisions reached.  It is desirable, on the other hand, that similar Treaties should be concluded between those of the signatory Powers whichhave not hitherto concluded treaties to cover this question.    14.  The new agreement should be regarded as not affecting the rights and obligations resulting from the Covenant of  the League of Nations nor restricting the mission of the League  to take suitable  measures for safeguarding effectivelythe peace of the world.    15.  It would be well  to have the Treaty recognised  by third Powers  as  an instrument designed to ensure the maintenance of peace,  and to get them toundertake not to interfere with its application.    16.  In putting forward the observations set forth above, the  Governmentof the Republic has kept&apos;within the limits laid down in the British memorandum,in which it is pointed out that the list of points submitted to the attention of theother Governments is not a limited one.    Consequently, it seems to  them appropriate to draw the attention  of theGovernments concerned to the following complementary points : -    (a) The  suggestion made by  the German  Government, and to which France           has no objection,  to include the Netherlands, if they so  wish, in the           new agreement;    (b) The  consultation to be envisaged between the signatory Powers, in the           event of political tension between them, with a view to rendering more           efficacious the working of Article 11  of the Covenant  of the League           of Nations;    (c)  Each signatory Power to be empowered to set up special organisations on           its territory, based on the project presented to  the  Conference for the           reduction and limitation of armaments, with a  report by M. Bourquin           (document Conf.D.  CG.108, annex).    17.  The programme thus  laid down does not, however, exhaust the objects of  the negotiation to  be envisaged  as regards the settlement  of the situation created on the  7th  March, 1936.  In particular, and in accordance with theprovisions  agreed  upon on the 19th March, 1936, suitable  provisions should beadopted to forbid or restrict the subsequent erection  of fortifications in a zoneto be defined.    A fortiori  the present  memorandum  does  not take into account all thequestions which will arise  in the course of the forthcoming Conference  and forthe solution of which the collaboration of  other  countries will be indispensable.It has been purposely  limited to the principal problems connected directly withthe negotiation  of the  treaty to  be  substituted for the Treaty of Locarno andwhich,  for  this  reason,   and  subject to  the  eventual  participation  of  theNetherlands  in  the negotiations, does not call  for the  participation of other powers tham the signatories of the last-named Treaty.    The Government of the Republic wishes to point out that,  in accordance withthe spirit  of the  arrangement  of the 19th March,  1936,  and  of  the  LondonCommunique of the 23rd July,  this negotiation should be  the  prelude to  a  widernegotiation which implies the collaboration of all the interested Powers.

[C  6944/4/18]                     No. 3.      United Kingdom Delegate to Foreign Office.-(Received October 5.)(No. 106.) -  THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compli-ments, and has the honour  to transmit copy of a memorandum communicated byM. Delbos on the 2nd October respecting the Treaty of Locarno and the position ofBelgium.    United Kingdom Delegation,           Geneva, October 2, 1936.                             Enclosure in No. 3. (Translation.) Consequences from the Military Point of View of a change in the International     Situation of Belgium as established by the Treaty of Locarno. (Communi-     cated by M. Delbos to the Secretary of State.)     A modification of the international situation of Belgium tending to divest her  of every obligation  as  a guarantor Power and  leaving  her merely in the position of one guaranteed might have serious consequences, both from the point of view of Belgian security and from the point of view of French and  British interests.                                     I.     So long as Belgium intends herself to ensure the  protection of her frontiers, such a modification would not result for her in any reduction of her military burdens.     Franco-Belgian military collaboration, in the event of a conflict, in effect only implies assistance to be rendered  by  the French armies to  a Belgium whose territory has been violated or has been threatened with violation; by abandoning her position as guarantor Power in respect of France, Belgium would thus not be avoiding any positive  obligation.     On the other hand,  it is permissible to ask whether, once the international situation of Belgium  has been modified,  French assistance would  have the same efiicacity.     At present this assistance takes the  form of intervention, after a very short lapse of time, by the first echelon of important  forces.     The  despatch of these  forces after  this short lapse of time  presupposes a careful preparation in time of peace on the part of the General Staffs of the two armies working in collaboration; and it necessitates close and frequent contacts between these General Staffs.     As soon  as  the co-operation of the two armies no longer  takes place as the consequence of reciprocal obligations between the two countries, two forces will operate to relax the military ties which exist between  Paris and  Brussels; on the one hand, the same Belgian elements which would favour the  abandonment by Belgium of the position of guarantor would declare for a strict application of the principle of neutrality; on the other hand, Germany  would not fail,  proceeding from the modification which had taken place in the situation of  Belgium in relation to  France, to argue that the guarantee given without reciprocity by  all the signatories  of the new treaty to Belgium implies  a loosening of the military ties  with France.  It is  impossible  not  to recall in  this respect  the advantage which  German apologetics have drawn from the supposed Anglo-Belgian Staff conversations which preceded 1914.     Thus the preparation in time of peace of the Franco-Belgian co-operationmentioned  above  would  become   impossible;  from  which   the   following consequences  would result, which would not fail to  have a serious  import for Belgium :      An inevitable delay in the assistance  given by  the French  armies  to the Belgian armies fighting for the defence of the national frontiers;     A risk that the Belgian forces  would find  themselves unable to hold  up the German forces on the Meuse;
247     The Belgian forces would be obliged to abandon to the enemy the greater part of the territory, with  all the consequences which might result  so far as concerns the subsequent conduct of operations.     Such risks would not, moreover, be compensated for by. any chance that the Reich, on account of the attitude  of strict neutrality adopted by Belgium, might at the  beginning of  a  conflict renounce the  invasion of that country.  The invasion of Belgian territory by Germany in the event  of military operations in Western Europe results in effect as much from strategical  necessities as from political aims; every diminution of  the  possibility  of defending the  country would,  by increasing the  advantages to be gained from such an invasion, in the end only encourage the German General Staff still more to undertake it.                                     II.     Such, generally speaking, from the Belgian point of view, are the military consequences to be foreseen, whether  it is a case of war on land or of war in the air.     If  the  situation be now considered from the point of view  of French and British interests, the consequences appear singularly grave.     It will be noted first  that, should  a German offensive in Belgian territory be facilitated for the reasons indicated above, the concentration of the French and British  forces,  deprived as they  would be of the  distant  Franco-Belgian cover which it would not have been possible to organise in time, might be hindered.  But it is, above all, from the  point of view of aerial warfare that the consequences would be serious.     Here there are several hypotheses to examine :      (a)  The case of  a German attack confined to the  Franco-German frontier             and not including flight over Belgium.     Under  the Treaty of Locarno, France and England were entitled to demand from Belgium the bringing into  action of the Belgian observation service and anti-aircraft system,  the right of flight over Belgium (which would result, in any case, from the application of article 16 of the  Covenant of the League of Nations) and the right to use Belgian aerodromes.  That being so, the French and British air forces would be able,  without difficulty and effectively, to attack  the Ruhr Basin.   Moreover, the Belgian observation  service  would allow enemy forces making  for  Paris or London to be observed  within  a limit  of time compatible with the necessary delay  in  putting  into  operation  the arrangements  for  the defence of the two capitals.     On the  other hand, in the  event of Belgium confining herself  to the attitude of a &quot;  guaranteed Power,&quot; Great Britain would find  it impossible  to operate on the  vital zone of the Ruhr, and on the German air bases in  Westphalia; it would follow from this that the assistance of the British air  forces would lose a great deal of its  effect so far as France is concerned.   As  for the French air forces,  they would  be unable, without inevitable  difficulties,  to reach  these objectives, for  to do so they  would have to make a long flight over german territory.    It will be observed, on the other hand, that  Germany, operating from baseson the North Sea, would be able, without violating Belgian air, to attack London.In this case Great Britain would have no chance of attacking, by way of reprisals,German objectives of comparable importance.    (b)  The case of a German land attack confined to the  Franco-German frontier             with violation  of Belgian air, but  without acts  of  war  being             committed on Belgian territory.    If the Belgian Government does not consider flight over its territory to be acasus belli, the  situation will be,  from the French and English point of view,extremely serious.  Certainly, French and British air forces will be able in their turn to fly over Belgian territory to attack the Ruhr and  the German air bases inWestphalia; but France and Great Britain will lose the advantage  of the Belgianobservation service, which will  be very serious for the security of Paris and stillmore for that of London.    (c)  The case of  the German attack violating the territory and the air Of:             Belgium.      [13948]                                                      c
     Evidently in this case there is no theoretical difference between Belgium asa guarantor  and as a guaranteed Power.   But if,  in  consequence  of  the new situation of Belgium, no preparations for intervention had been made in time ofpeace, the efficacy and, above all, the rapidity of the intervention of  the Franco-British air forces would be seriously diminished.  The absence of previous agree-ment for the organisation of the observation service in Belgian territory for theadvantage  of France and  England would, moreover, have extremely awkwardconsequences, at least at the outset of the conflict.                                ;    in.     To sum up, the modification of the situation of Belgium in  the new treaty would offer grave drawbacks from the point  of  view of French  and Britishinterests.     As for Belgium herself, since the French and British obligations towards a guaranteed Power are  identically the same as towards a guarantor  Power, this modification would  be  without practical inconvenience,  if  preparation could bemade in time of peace  for  the co-operation of the  three countries.  But, for thereasons indicated  above,  the most  serious  doubts must be expressed in this connexion.  If these doubts are even in part well founded, the consequences forBelgian security would  be grave; in view of the conditions of modern war, havingregard at once to the possibility of  a German attack by rapid motorised forces and  to the technical  conditions of French intervention,  a minute and continuouspreparation for  co-operation is particularly necessary.  In the absence of suchpreparation, the French army would only be able, at the best, to form a rallying-point for the Belgian army.     Geneva, October 2, 1936.[C 7145/4/18]                    No. 4.           Sir E. Drummond to Mr. Eden.-(Received October 12.)(No.  1097.)Sir,                                                Rome, October 8, 1936.    I HAVE  the honour to report that, in the course of  the conversation whichI had with the Minister for  Foreign Affairs on the 7th October on my return from leave, his Excellency informed me that he was studying the memorandum circulated by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject of the new Locarno Treaty.He said that,  after having read  this document, he was doubtful whether  any comments were required from the Italian Government because the  substantiveparagraph, namely, No. 5, in which the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government were set out, made no mention of Italy and seemed to contemplate simply an agreementbetween three  Powers, or, if Belgium were included, four.  He implied that, as no mention was made of Italy, it  was the deliberate intention of  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to exclude her from the new pact.   I answered that I felt  sure thatthis was a complete misunderstanding of the situation.   His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment expected, and hoped, that Italy, as one  of  the  guarantors  of  the formerLocarno Pact,  would be equally a guarantor of the new pact.   The memorandumsimply had reference to the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Italy  wason an equal footing as a guarantor, and it would have been presumptuous on thepart of His Majesty&apos;s Government to have made any  suggestions  as to whatItalian  policy  should be.    2.   This   explanation,  which I  hope was  correct,  seemed considerably to relieve Count  Ciano&apos;s mind and he asked me if I would have any objection totalking over the question  with Signer Vitetti and Signor Buti, who were nowexamining the memorandum.  I replied that, although I had no official knowledgeof the  intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government, I should  always be willing totake part in such an informal discussion.   His Excellency then sent for SignorVitetti  and asked him to explain his point of view.  I found that  Signor Vitettidid not share the apprehensions of  Count Ciano  on the main  point, but he explained that the present view of the Italian Foreign Office, although no final conclusion had been reached, was not in favour  of the changes proposed byHis  Majesty&apos;s Government.  Signor  Vitetti explained  that, according to his
[C  7257/5/18]                    No.  5.Translation of a Memorandum, communicated by the German Charge d&apos;Affaires  on October 14, respecting the Proposed  Meeting of the Five Locarno Powers.    THE German Government have the honour to express their views as followswith  regard to the questions  raised  in the memorandum  of His Majesty&apos;;sGovernment of the 17th September, so far as this is possible without knowledgeof the attitude of the other Governments concerned at this stage of the presentexchange of views.      [13948]                                                    c 2reading of the memorandum,  there was to be  a general  pact  by which GreatBritain and Italy would guarantee France against attack by Germany and vice versa.  But there would be an  additional agreement  by  which  Great britain would be guaranteed by France and Germany should Great  Britain be attacked by either  of these  Powers.  Italy was left out.  Incidentally, he  asked  whyBelgium was omitted as a guarantor of Great Britain  while Great Britain was ready to guarantee Belgium.   I told him that I could not answer this question.He observed that Italy might well ask for a similar guarantee from France andGermany,  and then there would be one main pact and two  subsidiary regionalagreements.  Count Ciano held that this would be a mistake.  Let us assume asa hypothesis, Signor Vitetti continued, that Germany wished to attack France;if she did  so directly, she would be opposed by the three Powers.  But supposingthese regional agreements came into force, should she  then  attack either GreatBritain or Italy instead of France, she would  be opposed by only two Powersinstead of three.  It was therefore to her advantage to do so.  Italy was quite prepared to face a German-Italian quarrel, but she did not at all like the ideaof being in the possible position of a State attacked by Germany because the latterreally wished to fight France.   He said that, of course, it was not the businessof the Italian Government to give any advice to His Majesty&apos;s Government;  but was a guarantee from France really worth running the risk which he had pointedout?  If Germany intended to attack Great Britain, surely  the French position was such that France would in any case come to  our help.   He remarked that thearrangements in question seemed to him to change the whole spirit of Locarno.Instead of collaboration between the four Great Powers, there would  be two sets of three Powers, and the previous advantages  of  consultation between, and conciliation by, Italy  and Great  Britain would be greatly  diminished.  In his view the previous treaty derived special value from the disinterestedness of thetwo guai  ntors and therefore their power to keep and to promote peace between france and Germany.    3.  Lastly, there was a point concerning the Franco-Russian Pact.  count ciano stated that France could not move under that pact against Germany unlessshe had the consent of the two guarantor Powers, namely,  Great Britain andItaly.  This ought to afford Germany considerable reassurance about that pact;but under the present  system this condition would disappear  and German dislikeof the  pact grow all the greater.    4.  For all these  reasons Count  Ciano was inclined, although,   as he hadalready told me, he had not yet come to anjr final decision, strongly to  recommendthat the five Powers should revert to the  general lines of the original pact.   Ireplied that there seemed to me to be a certain force in  his arguments, but mightnot a formula be found to cover the possibility of an attack,  say, by Germany on great  Britain, because Germany wished  to attack France  ?  It was certainlyimportant that there should be solidarity between all the guarantor Powers.  Tothis Count Ciano replied that  it might be very difficult  to find any such formula.The  simplest method  would be\a general pact of  non-aggression and mutual assistance between all  the signatories, but he did not  like such an idea, whichwould place a completely different aspect on Locarno.   Further, it would involvea British guarantee of the  Italian frontiers and raise the  whole question of theMediterranean.  In fact, it would involve far wider questions than  that  of locarno itself.  I  told him that I would report his  provisional views to  theForeign Office and was grateful to him for having expressed them to me.                                                    I have, &amp;c.                                                       E. DRUMMOND.
    1.  The  German Government  assume, from  the terms of  the  invitationconveyed to them on the basis of the London communique of the 23rd July last,and their reply thereto, that the subject to be dealt with by the conference willbe the replacement of the old Rhine Pact of  Locarno by  a new pact between germany,  Belgium,  France,  Great  Britain and Italy.   If the communique  inquestion contemplates the discussion later  on of other problems connected withthe securing  of  European peace,  a decision with  regard to these problems  (as indeed the communique itself indicates), can only be reached when the result  ofthe conference of the Five Powers,  with respect to the subject to be  dealt with at that Conference has been arrived at.  The German Government must thereforereserve  till then their attitude with regard to the question whether, and if  sowhich, other  problems in given circumstances might later be discussed.    2.  The  structure of the new pact would naturally have to take into account the political developments which have given rise to the plan for such a pact.  TheGerman Government, as already proposed in their  peace plan of the 31st  march last, accordingly regard obligations for  non-aggression between Germany  on theone hand and Belgium and France on the  other, and the guaranteeing of these obligations by Great Britain and Italy, as the essential elements  of the pact.The answer to the question whether these  elements in the treaty should furtherbe  supplemented by non-aggression  and guarantee  obligations  between  othertreaty partners will have to depend on whether such an  extension of  the  systemof the old Rhine Pact is in the general  interests of peace and whether it  can  beintroduced without upsetting the necessary balance of the  treaty system.  TheGerman  Government will  only be  able to form, their final judgment on thispoint when they have learned the views of  the  other Governments concerned.    3.  The  German Government, in their peace plan of the 31st March last, havealready declared themselves prepared for a renunciation of aggression vis-a-visBelgium and France unrestricted by any exceptions.  From their standpoint theyhave no motive for weakening the security  for peace which lies in the conclusionof such an agreement for the renunciation of aggression by demanding exceptionsof any kind  whatever.  In case the other  Governments  concerned should thinkit necessary to insist on making exceptions  of this  kind, it would be for them  toput forward proposals to this end.   Meanwhile, however, the German government must  indicate at once that they  do not consider  the  method proposed by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in  their memorandum of the 17th September to be prac-ticable.   In article 2 of the  old Rhine  Pact, to which the memorandum  refers,the important exceptions  in practice to the provisions for the renunciation  of aggression are laid down with reference to  the provisions of the Covenant of theLeague of Nations, and in particular to article 16 thereof.  The repetition of theuse of this method is, in the view of the German Government,  precluded  by thefact that the interpretation of article 16 has led to the well-known differences  ofopinion between  Germany and the other Locarno Powers, and, furthermore, by thefact that the discussion regarding the future of  article 16 and other provisions  ofthe Covenant of the League of Nations is at present still quite open.    4.  The  German Government do not consider it  either necessary or appro-priate to submit  to the Council of the League of Nations the question of deciding whether  an infringement of the  obligation of non-aggression has taken place and consequently whether the guarantee obligation has entered into force.    It will be necessary to examine whether such decisions should not be reached by a common decision of the parties to the treaty who are not, in a given case,directly parties  to the conflict.  A  distinction  between flagrant breaches  of thetreaty and other kinds of breaches of the treaty, such as was laid down in the oldRhine Pact, will no longer come into consideration  in the new pact.    5.  The  obligations of non-aggression  on which agreement is to be reachedwill, naturally, have to extend, also to air  attacks.   Moreover, the rendering  ofassistance  by the guarantor  Powers would have to cover their air  forces also.The German Government, therefore, share the view of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat there is  no necessity for a special air pact.    6.  The German Government consider  it appropriate that the parties to thetreaty, especially those between whom obligations  of non-aggression are agreedupon, should at the same time reach agreements, by suitable peaceful procedure,for the settlement of the disputes arising between  them.   .

Speech by the King of the Belgians to  the Belgian Cabinet on October 14. (Translation.) Messieurs les Ministres,     When taking the Constitutional  Oath,  Belgian Sovereigns bind themselves to maintain the integrity and independence of the country.     Like my predecessors, I intend to fulfil this solemn promise.  It is for this reason that I wished to preside over this Council which has to determine the measures to be submitted to Parliament with a view to giving Belgium a military statute adapted to present circumstances. I. Reasons for the necessity of reinforcing our military system.     The Government has been considering for more than  a year the problem of reinforcing our military system.  Several reasons  have  compelled  them to do so:      (a) The rearmament of Germany following upon the complete militarisation of Italy and Russia has  provoked exceptional  precautionary measures in most other States, even those which are deliberately pacific such  as Switzerland and the Netherlands;     (b) The transformation  of  methods  of warfare under  the  influence of technical progress, notably in matters  of aviation and motorisation, gives  hence- forward to the opening stages of a conflict a strength, a  speed and an amplitude which are particularly alarming for countries of small extent such as Belgium;     (c)  The reoccupation, like a thunderbolt, of the Rhineland and the removal to our frontier of the points of departure of a possible German invasion have increased our anxieties;     (d) At  the same  time, we have witnessed the shaking  of the foundations ofinternational security by infractions of conventions, even those which have been freely subscribed, and by the relative impossibility of adapting, in present circum- stances, the  stipulations of the Pact of the League of Nations  for the repression of these infractions.     (e)  Finally, the internal dissensions in some  States risk becoming involvedin the rivalries of political and social  systems of other States and thus bringing about a conflagration even more desperate  and more devastating than that fromthe after-effects of which we are still suffering.II. -Historical.                                                   .-     ;     It is useful, I think,  to  recall here the successive stages through which the examination of the military question has passed in the course of the last months.     This recapitulation will, at the same time, establish that the period of studycan now be regarded  as closed.                                f1) Not printed
    The necessity of making our military forces proportional to the risks from foreign dangers became apparent in the spring of 1935.    Various projects were submitted to me by the Army General Staff, and, finally,in November 1935, I signified my agreement to a programme, the essential features of which constituted then, to my mind, a minimum.    This programme was submitted to the members of the Government  and thelatter constituted within itself a select committee charged with examining, in fulldetail, the problem of our security. .  : On the 7th February, 1936, the Cabinet Council reached agreement on the text of a military Bill; this did not meet with the approval of the committees in theChamber and the Government agreed to the tabling of an amendment suggesting the immediate application of article 53 of the  Military Law.    The Bill, thus amended, was voted by the Chamber on the 6th April.    In the meanwhile,  on the 10th January, the suggestion had been put forward that the problem in  its entirety  should be discussed by  a mixed  commission.    This idea was favourably received in political and parliamentary circles.III. The Mixed Commission.    The Mixed Commission was created by the Royal Decree of  the 25th March,1936.    After thirty-seven sessions, the commission, having examined the problem inall its aspects, brought its labours to an end and formulated a series of conclusions.Though they may differ as regards details of  application, they show  unanimous agreement as far as general principles are  concerned, and notably on the necessityof a permanent cover (of the frontier).   Its principal suggestions, which concern the purchase of material, defence against  air attack, the organisation of strong-holds, and the system of recruitment, are of a nature to require decisions withoutdelay.    In any case the new military law must be voted before the 1st December next,the date on which begins the incorporation of the 1937 class.    Furthermore,  in face  of the  dangers of the  international  situation  thecountry would not understand the Government delaying to submit to parliament the requisite proposals.    It is also right that the problem should be clearly explained to public opinion.IV. Foreign Policy determines  Military Policy.    Our military policy like our foreign policy, which necessarily determines theformer, must aim not at preparing for a war which may be more or less victoriousas a result of a coalition, but rather at keeping war from our territory.    The reoccupation  of the Rhineland,  which was contrary to both the  letter and the spirit of the Locarno agreements, has placed us almost in the internationalposition  which we occupied before the war.    Our geographical  position  makes  it necessary for us to maintain forcessuch as to discourage any of our neighbours from invading our territory in orderto attack another Power.  In fulfilling this  mission Belgium contributes in ahigh degree to the maintenance of peace in Western Europe;  and she createsfor herself ipso facto a right to the respect and, if  need be, the  assistance  of  allthe Powers who are interested in preserving  this peace.    On these essentials Belgian  opinion, I believe, is unanimous.    But our engagements should not go any further.  Any unilateral policyweakens our position  abroad,  while  provoking, rightly or wrongly,  discordat  home.  An alliance, even if purely  defensnre,  does not  fulfil  our aim;for, however prompt the assistance rendered by an ally might be,  it could onlycome  into play after the first shock of the invader, which will be devastating.To combat this shock we shall in any case be alone.    If she herself does not dispose of a  defence system capable of resisting ashock, Belgium would from the very outset be  invaded in depth and immediatelyravaged.  When this stage is  passed the  intervention of friendly Powers might indeed assure a final  victory; but the struggle would cover the country withdevastation, compared to  which that of the war of 1914-18 would appear  buta feeble reflection.
V. The Aim of our Policy:  To ward off War.    It is for this reason that we should, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs hasrecently said, follow a policy which is &quot;exclusively and wholly Belgian.&quot;   Thispolicy should aim resolutely at keeping us out of the quarrels of our neighbours.This corresponds with our national ideals.   It can be supported by&apos; a reasonablemilitary and financial  effort and it will command the support of the  Belgianpeople animated by an intense and primordial desire for peace.    Let those who doubt the possibility of such a foreign policy consider theproud and firm example of Holland and Switzerland.  Let them recall with what.decisive weight the scrupulous observation by Belgium of her status of neutralitytold in our favour and in favour of the Allies during the.whole war and duringthe subsequent settling  of accounts.    Our moral situation would haA^e been  incomparably weaker at home andthe world would not have vouchsafed to us the same sympathy if the invader hadbeen able to argue that we were allied with one of his adversaries.    The aim of our military system, I  repeat, is therefore  solety to preserveus from war from whatever direction, and it  is necessary that  public  opinion should have indisputable assurance of this fact.VI.-Our present Military Statute does not  meet this end.    Our Military Statute, based on the military law of  1929, though excellent inmany  ways, no longer meets the new possibilities of a sudden invasion.  It doesnot assure  either  the permanent defence of our frontiers, or security  for the mobilisation or for the concentration of  the army.  A  more or less unexpected.invasion could in a few hours win valuable prizes and  paralyse beyond  hope of recovery the mass of our  forces.VII.- Necessity to modify it.    This deficient organisation must be remedied at once. It is in order to decide on the means to do so that I have called you together.    Representatives of  the three  great  traditional parties  which include thegreat  majority of Belgians, I desire that you will make yours the Bill of theMinister of National Defence.    By solving the military problem in a union of high patriotic understandingyou will give to the country both the necessary  peace  of  mind  in the  face ofevents  abroad  and the  atmosphere of security which is indispensable to publicprosperity.    You will thus have established once more in the eyes of the country that theessential preoccupation of the Government of National Union  is to place  above all things the higher interest of Belgium.[G 7301/7284/4.J                   No. 7.                     Mr. Eden to Sir E. Ovey (Brussels).(No.  518.)Sir,                                        Foreign Office, October 15, 1936.    THE Belgian Ambassador came to see me this evening, when he read to me and left with me the attached communication from the Belgian Government.   I told his Excellency that I would not conceal from him that I had been considerablysurprised and indeed perturbed by King Leopold&apos;s declaration.  I  could not helpfeeling that it was particularly unfortunate that the Belgian Government had not seen fit to inform us in advance or to consult with His Majesty&apos;s Government inany way.  Indeed, the first that I had heard of the declaration was when I  readit in the newspaper in the train on my way back from Sheffield that morning. Ifthe Belgian Government had felt able to inform  us in advance,  it might have beenpossible to devise some means of meeting their difficulties in some other way.    2.  The Ambassador seemed to feel unable to deny the force of this complaint,and could only say that he himself had received no  prior information of thedeclaration, and that he could only imagine  that the decision was taken suddenly.I must bear in mind that there were powerful motives of internal politics con-
cerned.  It was essential to improve the military defences of Belgium, and to do this a united national front was necessary.  There was no doubt that the feeling of the Flemish section of the population towards France was by no. means friendly.The Franco-Soviet Pact had been for many the last straw.  Belgian opinion wasfearful  lest,  as  the  outcome of that pact, France should  become involved in hostilities with Germany, with the result that Belgium would be expected to cometo the aid of France in a quarrel which was none of her concern. ;   3.  I told his Excellency that in  the  circumstances which he described  i thought that he  was wrong in thinking that Belgium would be obliged to go tothb assistance of France.  The Ambassador said that this might be so, but that theBelgian public could never understand  it  and that there was a  strong feeling against being involved in the  consequences of  the Franco-Soviet Pact.    4.  I then told his  Excellency that, though I had not as yet received  a  full text from Brussels of the  King&apos;s declaration (the Ambassador said that he was still without one, and complained of the inadequacy of the account at his disposal),there  were certain points which I wished to put to the  Belgian government without delay, and I would be grateful if he would do so.  Before doing so, I must,however, point out that His Majesty&apos;s declaration was all the more surprising inthat we were already engaged in  diplomatic  exchanges in preparation for theFive-Power Conference.  The communications which  were now passing between us on this subject would clearly have to deal with the very issues  to which HisMajesty&apos;s declaration referred. It was  all the more astonishing, therefore, that,whereas all the parties to  the negotiations had agreed to keep them confidential,the Belgian Government should have made  a public declaration which clearly con-cerned a most important aspect of these negotiations.    5.  I then enumerated the points which I asked his Excellency to put  to his &apos;Government.   What, in the view of the Belgian Government, would be the effectof His Majesty&apos;s declaration on the remnants of the Locarno Treaty as  it stillexists between His Majesty&apos;s Government, Belgium and France % The Ambassadorwould remember that I stated in the House of Commons  that we were still bound by the Locarno Treaty, even if Germany had denounced it.   What would be theeffect of the declaration upon this arrangement 1  His Excellency would remember that, under the old Locarno Treaty,  Belgium  did guarantee France, though shedid not, of course, guarantee  this country.   It might even be open  to the FrenchGovernment to say, if they wished, that if Belgium ceased  to guarantee France,then the old Locarno Treaty was no longer  in force between them.  What wouldthen be the position  of us three ?    6.  The  second point  as  to which I wished to ask his Government was howHis Majesty&apos;s declaration could be reconciled with the text of the proposals  of the19th March.   His Excellency would recall that the four Powers, Belgium, France,the United Kingdom and Italy, then undertook to work for &quot;obligations of mutual assistance between Belgium,  France, the United Kingdom  and Italy, or any ofthem.&quot;  Finally, I asked  the Ambassador  to point out  to his Government thatwhile it  was quite true that we stated  in  our first preliminary note  of the17th September, to which, incidentally, I reminded his Excellency that we had notyet received  the  Belgian reply, that we only asked for  guarantees from Franceand Germany, and not from Belgium, we did not, however,  say anything in thatnote about the Belgian guarantee to  France.  It might well be  that such  aguarantee would be judged to be necessary as part of the new western arrange-ment which we were contemplating making.   Did His Majesty&apos;s declaration close the door to any such negotiation ?   If I understood the note which his  Excellencyhad just left me aright, this would appear not to be so, but I feared that therewas considerable danger  of  misunderstanding on this  and other subjects.    I pointed out to the Ambassador that His Majesty&apos;s declaration would be of thegreatest  service  to isolationists in this  country.  Indeed, it was  already being used for this purpose, and I showed his Excellency the headlines in the copy of the evening Standard which had just reached me.   . 7.  The Ambassador said that he would  certainly transmit the points  whichI had made to him to his Government.  He begged me, however,  to believe thatthe last thing that the Belgian Government intended was to take any action  whicbcould arouse misgivings in this country.  There was, however,- a feeling iri Belgiumof some resentment against French policy.  i     ;  .          /&apos;                 I -am, &amp;o.&apos;        &apos;  n .

 (Translation.)      Communication of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Commerce.                                Belgian Embassy, London, October 15, 1936.    YOU will already have received through the press the text of the communica- tion which His Majesty the King made yesterday to the Council of Ministers. This communication has been made public in accordance with the wish expressed by  all the members of  the  Government.  It concerns the problem of national defence, but at the same time the orientation of our  foreign policy is laid down in its relationship to our military policy.    The King&apos;s language is perfectly clear.  Nevertheless, the first commentaries on it abroad seem to show that a tendencious interpretation might be  given to it in certain circles.  I have particularly in mind the  passage in which the King expressed  himself as follows :         &quot; Our geographical situation compels us to keep up military  forces of a    size sufficient to dissuade any of our neighbours  from using our territory to  .  attack another country.  In fulfilling this mission Belgium co-operates to a    marked degree  in  the  preservation of the peace of Western Europe.  She    acquires ipso facto a right to the respect and eventual help of all the States    who are interested in the preservation of this peace.   .    .        &quot; I  believe Belgian opinion to be unanimous on this point, and bur    obligations should  not go beyond this.  Every unilateral policy weakens our    external  position  and  creates,  rightly  or  wrongly,  division within our    country.&quot;    This passage seems to be referred to in a report  of the Havas Agency which speaks of  the eventual  repercussions  which His Majesty&apos;s communication might have on the diplomatic instruments to which Belgium  is a party.  The same report adds that,  if  King  Leopold&apos;s  declarations  are to be  strictly interpreted,Belgium&apos;s return to complete neutrality,  which they  seem to contemplate, would gravely affect the Covenant of the League of Nations.    Although the context  is not in any sense ambiguous, I  think  it well  to emphasise that the question has never  arisen, and  could never arise,  for our country to withdraw from the  international obligations it has contracted andby which it is bound.    Belgium, faithful to her past, will certainly give an example  of loyalty  in this connexion.   This is  particularly the case as regards her  obligations underthe  Covenant of the League of  Nations, towards which we have  never ceased to show the most complete fidelity.    The only question which arises for the  Belgian Government  to-day, is  toknow to what extent it is proper to go  beyond the common obligations containedin the Covenant, in new agreements which may be concluded.  But whatever maybe the  decision reached  on this  point,  these common obligations  will remain those of Belgium.[C 7328/7284/4]                  No.  8.                   Mr. Eden to Mr. Lloyd Thomas (Paris).(No.  1737.)Sir,                                        Foreign Office, October 16, 1936.    THE French Ambassador asked to see me this morning, when he said therewere two  matters about which he wished to speak to me. &apos;  The first was thedeclaration made by King Leopold in respect of Belgium&apos;s foreign policy.  TheFrench Government had received no prior notification of this  declaration, andthere were several points which would need to be cleared up.   These were theeffect of this new declaration upon (1) Belgium&apos;s position as a member  of theLeague; (2) the existing Locarno Treaty position and the proposals agreed upon in London on the 19th March; (3) the present negotiations for a new western european Pact; (4) the Franco-Belgian  military agreement.  Accordingly, theFrench Ambassador in Brussels had  been instructed to approach the Belgian      [13948]                                                      D
 Government on these points.  In the meanwhile the French Government were also anxious to know the attitude of His Majesty&quot;s Government in the matter.     2.  I replied that we also had had no prior intimation that such a declaration was forthcoming,  and  I had told the Belgian Ambassador  last night that I regretted that prior consultation had not been possible, more particularly in the light of the fact that we were all now engaged on negotiations for a new Western agreement, which negotiations must be affected by this declaration.     3.  I then gave the French Ambassador some account of the points which I had raised with Baron Cartier de Marchienne, which his Excellency would notice were of the same character as, if less numerous than,  the points raised by the French Government.  I added that the Belgian Ambassador had brought me a declaration from  the  Belgian  Government,  an extract of  which  I  read to M. Corbin, which made  it clear that the Belgian Government intended to continue to observe their obligations under the  Covenant.     4.  The Ambassador thanked me for  the information, and said that he him- self regretted this new Belgian step,  which, he feared, would be a further complication in  the international situation.  It had been received with consider- able gratification in Germany, where it was regarded as a success for German policy.  Since the Germans desired nothing better than to be able to deal with other countries one by one, they were no doubt very gratified at a move such as this, for which they had not even had to ask.     5.  M. Corbin said that the second matter he wished to mention to me was the German reply to our note of the  17th September, which  he understood had been communicated to us. He was himself proceeding to Paris this evening, and it would be a great help  to him if he could give his Government some information on the subject.  He did  not ask for the reply itself, but would be content  with my appreciation of its effect on the chances of the negotiations.     6.   I replied  that   Sir R.  Vansittart  was  seeing Prince  Bismarck  thismorning, and that I hoped it might be possible for his Excellency to  take a copyof  the note with him  to Paris.  I would  communicate with him again later inthe day.                                                I am, &amp;c.                                                     ANTHONY EDEN.[C  7338/7284/4]                   No. 9.                     Mr. Eden to Sir E. Ovey (Brussels).(No. 521.)Sir,                                       Foreign Office, October 1%, 1936.    THE Belgian Ambassador asked to see me this afternoon, when, after a fewpreliminary observations, he left me the  attached  memorandum  which he hadreceived from the Belgian Government, dealing with certain of the points  whichI had raised in my conversation with him yesterday.  I told the Ambassador thatI regretted that I really could not accept the statement  that the declaration of king Leopold had not contained anything unexpected. It was perfectly true thatwe  were aware, as the French Government were aware, of the point of view ofthe Belgian Government in this matter, but what the Belgian Government had now done  was to make that point of view public without any prior consultationwith those with whom they had been in negotiation. It was evident that such adeclaration must  profoundly affect the negotiations themselves, and I could butrepeat my regret, which I had expressed to his Excellency yesterday, at themanner in which the  Belgian  Government had  made  their  declaration.    the ambassador  would  have noted the reactions  both here  and in  France  andGermany.    2.   Baron  Cartier de Marchienne  replied that he thought the press in thiscountry was.  already taking a more  objective view of the  situation.  We  must remember  that this initiative had its  origin in military necessities.  Belgium had greatly reduced her military strength, as we had done. In the long run the effectof what she was now doing would be to increase her military strength.  britain would  surely  prefer to see Belgium strong in a military sense.
                                Enclosure. (Translation.)Memorandum  communicated by  the Belgian Ambassador on October 16, 1936.    THE political  orientation defined in the King&apos;s  Speech contains  nothingunexpected.  An indication of it had already been given in M. Spaak&apos;s speech to the  foreign press representatives in July.  It had  also been the subject ofnumerous public and private discussions and of several  conversations with therepresentatives of the British and  French Governments,  in  particular  with messrs. Eden  and Delbos.  The object of the King&apos;s Speech, was to convince the country of the necessity for a new effort to ensure national defence.   Foreignpolicy was only brought into it in relation to the military problem.    2.   The Belgian reply to the British note is being  prepared  and will be delivered immediately.    3.   The King&apos;s speech does not in any  way affect the obligations by whichBelgium is bound.  Since the Treaty of  Locarno is in process of revision, theKing&apos;s speech  defines the ideas by which the Belgian Government will be guidedin the  course  of the forthcoming discussions.  For the  reasons given  therein,the  Belgian  Government  do not  wish  to assume,   in connexion  with  the contemplated new Western Pact,  any obligation of guarantee.    The Royal Government proposes to  confine  itself to the  obligations laiddown in the Covenant of the League of Nations, of which it will remain a  faithfulmember.                                                                  ,    London, October 16, 1936.[C 7145/4/18]                     No. 10.                   Mr. Eden to Sir E. Drummond (Rome).(No.  383.)(Telegraphic.)                             Foreign Office,  October 17, 1936.    YOUR despatch No. 1097 of 8th October :  Italian Governments provisionalviews on new Western European treaty.    The  following  observations may assist you  in  further discussion of thissubject with Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs :     You were right to tell Count Ciano that mere fact that Italy is not mentionedin paragraph 5 of our memorandum of 17th September in  no way implies anydesire on our part to exclude her from the new treaty.  Our intention is, of course,quite the contrary and should be clear from paragraph 6 of our memorandum, inwhich we specifically asked for Italian observations.    I do not share Signor Vitetti&apos;s view that fact that new treaty would providefor guarantees to united Kingdom and Italy as well as to Germany, Belgium andFrance would necessitate three different instruments.  Though our views are atpresent provisional only, we have been thinking of but one instrument (see in this    3.   I then observed to the Ambassador that paragraph 3 of the memorandumcontained no specific reference to Belgium&apos;s present position under the existingLocarno Treaty or to the agreement of the 19th March.  Was I to: understandthat these were embodied in the general undertaking he had  given in the first paragraph?  The Ambassador said he was confident this was so.  I replied thatI was glad of this, for the point was important.  We were trying to negotiate anew agreement for Western Europe, but this must take time and would certainlyprove difficult.  Meanwhile, we had said that we continued  to be bound by theengagements of the Locarno Treaty, and it was important to  know that Belgiumshared this view.  It might be that  I would have to approach his  Excellencyfurther on this matter.                                                I am, &amp;c.

 connexion discussion between ourselves and Italian Government in February 1935 concerning  arrangements to avoid a United Kingdom  guarantee  to  Italy and vice versa under Air Pact).  On 7th February, 1935 (see Foreign Office despatch No. 173), Italian i\mbassador informed us of&apos; Signor Mussolini&apos;s view  that there should be a single agreement embracing all  five Locarno Powers,  but  excluding United  Kingdom guarantee  to  Italy and vice  versa.  On the basis of these discussions  we  had some ground for assuming  that in new Western treaty Italian Government would not expect a guarantee from us or vice versa.     I do not feel that we are called upon to explain reason why we have not asked that Belgium should guarantee Great Britain; suffice  it to. say that our adherence in this respect to the old Locarno system was due entirely to strategic and not to political considerations.  For obvious reasons the important guarantees for us that of  Italy being excluded in the circumstances described above were those of France and Germany.     The important  fact which seems to emerge from your conversation is that the  Italian Government now prefer  the distinction between  guarantors and guaranteed  as  laid down  in the old  Locarno  Treaty to  the  more  general system of guarantees proposed  for the  new  treaty.   The arguments- advanced for this preference do not appear as given in your despatch to be very convincing. Do you think that there is some ulterior reason for this unhelpful attitude- or rather change of attitude ?     For  instance, I  do  not follow Signor Vitetti&apos;s argument  that, if  Italy and Great Britain were guaranteed by France, Germany would attack Great Britain and Italy sooner than France, because in such circumstances she would be opposed by only two Powers  instead of three.   Surely this danger (in  so far as it exists at all) is still  greater under the  Locarno system, where Great  Britain  and Italy are guarantor but not  guaranteed States ?   Being guarantors  Germany would have  the same inducement to  attack one or other  of  them in  the circumstances contemplated,  and could, moreover, do so with greater chance of impunity, since, if she did so attack either of them, she would not necessarily be opposed by any of the other parties to  the treaty, for none of them would  be bound by any guarantee given  to the victim of the aggression.    Again, the argument that, while under the old Locarno Treaty France would not take  action in Central and Eastern Europe unless she had  the consent of hertwo guarantors,  that condition disappears under the new treaty does  not seem to be altogether clear (paragraph 3 of your despatch).    I should be grateful for anything you can do to clear up the  above points. In any case you  should ask the Italian Government to be  good  enough to give ustheir views in writing as soon as possible, as, in that form, it will be easier tocollate them with those  of the other  Governments concerned.   Written replieshave now been received  from France and Germany, and Belgium is being askedto expedite hers.    Another reason for hastening the written replies still outstanding is that theGerman  Government have intimated that they do not wish their written replyto be communicated to those  Governments who, for  their  part, have not yetfurnished written replies.
