(1)     Telegram from General Smuts to Mr. te Water, dated July 17,  1936.    ZIONIST circles here deeply anxious over rumour that Jewish immigration into  Palestine  to  be suspended  pending  Royal  Commission.   Shall muchappreciate  if you will privately ascertain from  Ormsby  Gore for my personal information what position  is.   Step appears  departure  from  mandate  and repeated official declarations and may seriously damage Anglo-Jewish relations and  stir  up  most  lamentable world-wide  agitation.   Hence  my personalconcern. Smuts.                                    (2)            Telegram for Mr. te Water to send to General Smuts.    Confidential.  Your telegram of 17th  July.    I have seen  Ormsby Gore, who is fully alive to considerations urged in yourtelegram.   He wishes me  to  make  it clear for your personal and  confidential information that there is no  suggestion of bargaining or conceding to violence.Announcement of personnel and terms of reference of Royal Commission  willprobably be made in Parliament 29th July, but Commission will not proceed to       [13710]
Palestine till law and order have been restored.  Only then will His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in United Kingdom have to  consider and decide whether, in lightof these circumstances, some temporary suspension of all permanent immigrationmay be advisable  while Commission is actually at  work  and  Government is considering report;    Terms of reference to Commission are such that  Mandate itself cannot becalled in question.                                    (3)    Letter for the Secretary of State for the Colonies from General Smuts                             of July 23, 1936.                                      Union of South Africa,                                          Office of the Minister of Justice,                                              Palace of Justice,My dear Ormsby-Gore,                              Pretoria, July 23,  1936.    I asked te Water last week to  have a talk  with you over the  question ofthe suspension of the Jewish immigration into Palestine pending  the  enquiry by the Royal  Commission, and he has sent me your reply, from which  I inferthat no decision has been taken, or will be taken, until order  is finally restored.There is the possibility, if not the prospect, of such  a step being taken.    I do not know how far this matter has gone  already, but  I would urge very strongly that you do not go the whole length of a total suspension of immigrationpending the Royal Commission.   Why not rather take a smaller step of materiallyrestricting the number of immigrants during the enquiry ?  The total suspensionmay make it very difficult to re-start  immigration thereafter without a recurrence of Arab trouble, and would also be less calculated to inflame Jewish feeling.  Itwould also look less like a retreat before Arab agitation, with the consequent lossof prestige involved  in such a step.    The settlement in Egypt, which  apparently surrenders very important points which were insisted on before, makes  it all the more necessary for us to strengthen our position  in Palestine materially.  I am afraid  that  we can look for littlesupport from the Arabs in future in that quarter.  The policy of the national home will always be a barrier between the British Government and the PalestineArabs.   It is therefore all  the more important for us to secure  whole-hearted support among the Jews, not only in Palestine, but in the whole world, and I am afraid that total suspension under the circumstances of the present Arab revoltwould  be calculated very seriously  to turn Jewish  influence  and support very strongly against us,  and, without conciliating the Arabs, turn  the Jews also intoopponents  of the Empire.  If I had  to judge from the strength of feeling whichI see among Jews in South Africa,  I am very much concerned about the world-wide agitation which I foresee as the result of total suspension.     These, of course, are merely considerations of policy which no doubt you havefully before you, and are considering from all points of view.   But besides these considerations, there remains the deliberate policy  decided  on in the  war infavour  of the National  Home.  On that we should not weaken.   We have given up so much of the fruits of the Great War that at least this little ewe-lamb shouldnot also be slaughtered.  It is  the  imponderables that make history, and anyweakening of the British Government over this policy of the National  Homewould have profound repercussions  and  would be a  very disastrous step  to take.We  are bound in future to cling resolutely to Palestine, and to my mind that means resolutely sticking to the policy of the National Home, which I  am surethe British people and Empire  as a whole are whole-heartedly supporting.                                             With kind regards,                                                  Ever yours sincerely,                                                           J C  SMUTS     The Rt. Hon. W. G. A. Ormsby Gore, P.C.,         Colonial Office, Whitehall,             London, S.W.
     Letter to General Smuts from the Secretary of State for the Colonies                             of August 25, 1936.Dear Smuts,                                              August 2b, 1936.     Many thanks for  your  letter of the 23rd July, which arrived here while Iwas on a short holiday abroad.     Let me say at once that there is no question of abandoning the policy of theJewish National Home,  As I made clear to te Water, the terms of reference ofthe Royal  Commission are  such that the Mandate itself, in which the balfour declaration is embodied, cannot be called in question.  I do think, however, thatthe whole  Palestine problem must  be fully examined in relation  to our inter-national  obligations.   If a  long view  is taken, I feel sure you  will agree,  it isin the interests of Zionism itself that a solution  should be found which will permit of the Jewish National Home  developing in such a  way as will give no grounds for the apprehension, which now is undoubtedly widespread among theArabs, not only  of Palestine, but  throughout  the Arabic-speaking world, of jewish political and economic domination.  This, however, is a question  of major policy which must, of  course, await the report of  the Royal Commission.     As  regards the question of the suspension of  immigration into Palestinepending the enquiry, it will be a matter calling for very careful consideration on its merits whether  we should decide  in favour of the temporary suspension,in whole or in part, of all (not only Jewish) permanent immigration  during theperiod of the  Commission^ enquiry and our consideration of its report.   I am not yet in a position to say when such a decision will be taken, but I will certainlybring your views to the notice of my colleagues in the Cabinet  before any final conclusion  is reached.                                                Yours sincerely,                                                    W. ORMSBY GORE.General The Right Hon. J. C. Smuts, K.C., M.P.
