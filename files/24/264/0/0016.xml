Printed for the Cabinet. 1 September  1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy  No.  42CP. 2M (36).CABINET.PALESTINE SITUATION.   PROPOSED NEGOTIATIONS BY LORD WINTERTON AND SIR HERBERT SAMUEL.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I CIRCULATE herewith (see Appendix I) a copy of certain draft  proposals on Palestine which were handed  to me on the 8th September by Sir HerbertSamuel (who was the first High  Commissioner  for Palestine under  the civil administration from  1920 to 1925).  These  proposals  are,  I understand,accepted in general as a basis for  discussion by Lord Winterton  (the Chairmanof the unofficial committee recently formed to defend Arab interests in the Houseof Commons), and Sir Herbert Samuel and he hope to discuss them with NuriPasha, the Iraqi  Foreign Minister, in  Paris at the end of this week.    2.   Sir Herbert Samuel stated that he  did not wish to side-track  the workof the  Royal Commission, but he viewed with alarm the prospect of a series ofpropositions and  counter-proposals by Arabs  and Jews  respectively before theCommission without any effort being made  to explore a via media beforehand.Sir Herbert admitted, of course, that Dr. Weizmann and the Zionist Organizationcould not be expected to bind themselves  to  accept  his  suggestions,  and thatdoubtless they would have their own views to put before the Royal Commission,but he  had reason to believe that a  good many English Jews not closely identifiedwith the Zionist  Organization shared his views,  and he considered that,  evenif a  round-table conference cannot be  arranged in present  circumstances, someeffort should be made to get in touch with the Arab leaders.    3.   I was careful to explain that I could have no official knowledge of theseproposals, but that as Lord Winterton was an old personal  friend of Nuri&apos;s, he(Lord Winterton) must take his own course quite unofficially in any such project.I told Sir Herbert that at the moment it was not easy to see how any approachcould be made, but he was undeterred.  I refrained from any criticism of theactual  details of  the  proposals or any  indication as  to whether  or  not it was desirable that he should seek to get  further  Jewish support for them, but  Ipromised to forward them to the High Commissioner for Palestine and  ascertainhis reactions.  I have written to Sir Arthur Wauchope accordingly.    4.   Meanwhile, on  the  12th- September, Sir  Herbert  Samuel  informed  theColonial Office that Lord Winterton thought that it might  be useful if, in  the interview which had been arranged that day with the Arab leaders, Sir arthur wauchope  could indicate that these discussions with Nuri  were  about to takeplace.   In  reply,  Sir  Herbert was told that it  would be difficult*to say  whatconclusions would be drawn by the Arab leaders from any such communication and that it seemed desirable that the High Commissioner^ negotiations withthe Arabs  should he  left quite  distinct from  these very tentative discussionsbased on his proposals.  Exaggerated reports might get about and Nuri&apos;s position might be made more difficult.    5.   I have since  telegraphed to ask the High Commissioner for his views(see Appendix II).  I  shall circulate a copy of his reply when received.       [13794]
    6.  My own immediate reaction is that there is a large element of danger inthese  negotiations.  Even if it can be made clear that there is no official backingfor them, the Arabs may well think that they will provide an easy way out oftheir  present difficulties and so  further delay  that decision to end the strikeunconditionally to which there is some reason to believe that they have  almostbeen brought.  I have written  to Sir Herbert Samuel to-day pointing this  out and urging the utmost caution  on his part.                                               (Initialled)      W. O. G.

Telegram from the Secretary  of  State for the Colonies to  the            High Commissioner for Palestine, September 14, 1936.    IMMEDIATE.    Private and Personal.    My private and personal telegram of 11th September.  There will be  ameeting of Cabinet again on  Friday, when Palestine  questions will come upfor discussion.    I shall  be  obliged if you  will telegraph your views on  theSamuel-Winterton intervention by Wednesday, with your advice as to how it&apos;had best be handled.    On 12th September Samuel stated that Winterton thought it might be useful if in interview that day with Arab leaders you indicated that these discussions with Nuri  were  about to take place.  In reply Samuel was  told that it wouldbe difficult to say what conclusions would be drawn by Arab leaders from anysuch communication, and it seemed desirable that your negotiations with Arabsshould be left quite distinct from these very tentative discussions based on his proposals.  Exaggerated reports might get about and Nuri&apos;s position might bemade more difficult. In fact before any such communication was made it wouldseem desirable to consult him.  On the whole Samuel seemed to agree with these comments.
