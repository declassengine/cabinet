/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government confidential.COLONIAL OFFICE TELEGRAMS.DISTRIBUTED FROM OFFICES OF THE CABINET, SEPTEMBER  17, 1936.No. CO. 763 (36).         PUNISHMENT  OF OFFENCES UNDER EMERGENCY REGULATIONS.Paraphrase  Telegram from the Secretary of State to the High Commissioner for                                 Palestine.                    (Sent 3-30 P.M. 15th September, 1936.)    IMMEDIATE.   No. 489. Secret.    Frequently allegation is made here that though Government of Palestine isarmed  with  drastic powers for punishing  offences under emergency regulations(extending to death sentences), the  more stringent penal provisions remain to  alarge extent a dead letter.    Please furnish me with your observations  by telegraph on this allegationwith statistics of sentences imposed  and, in particular, what death sentences havebeen passed  and carried out.    The matter is important in connexion  with  discussion of effectiveness of theexisting regulations and  the necessity for &quot; martial law,&quot; and it would  be ofassistance if you could telegraph your reply before Friday.No. CO. 764 (36).      Paraphrase Telegram from the High  Commissioner for Palestine.                        Dated  16th  September,  1936.                 (Received 11-20 P.M. 16th September, 1936.)    IMMEDIATE.   No. 733.   Secret.    Your telegram No. 489.*  It is my considered opinion that, unless strike is called off and disturbances greatly decrease within a short space of time, situationin Palestine will be such  as to necessitate an early declaration of martial law.    2.   General Dill fully concurs with this  opinion.    3.   Main reasons why I favour an early declaration  of  martial law are : -    (1)  The widespread nature of the disorders in Palestine, the increased powerof the armed bands and the probability of further reinforcements being receivedby them from across our borders.  Severe measures of repression are necessitated by these three factors.    (2)  If repressive measures  are carried out  under martial law, there is (as  Iwrote in my secret despatch of the 22nd August,  1936) more  hope that in future years the Arabs will not act as an embittered  people ready to rise against theBritish  administration when opportunity offers.  It  has  been necessary for mealready to authorise the destruction of houses in about a dozen Arab villages.    It is  inevitable that  in the  course of military action  accidents should  occurinvolving deaths  of  perfectly loyal and innocent people,  without any blame to soldiers concerned.  Accidents  are inevitable,  but it is  better,  looking to  thefuture, that they should happen under martial law rather than under the ordinarycivil administration.                               * No. CO. 763 (36).      [13786-4]
    (3) Under  martial law justice will be administered far more-.speedily, and arabs  will not  receive encouragement by certain offences bein^^j^entiyntxeat^    I  should recommend for these reasons an early declaration of martial lawover the whole  of the country.    On the other hand, I realise, -after full  discussion with General Dill,  how important it is  that martial law should be fully effective from  the moment of itsdeclaration and that until after the arrival of the first division this cannot be so.    The opinion of General Dill, with which I agree, is that there should be nodeclaration  of  martial law until all his preparations are complete.   As far ashe can at  present judge this date will be early in October.  General Dill agrees with me, however, that martial law might well have to be declared at an earlier date should the situation deteriorate rapidly or should armed  bands act  with greater aggression and more success.    I shall telegraph statistics of court sentences with my comments to-morrow,Thursday.No. CO. 765 (36).
