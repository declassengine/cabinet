Printed for the,Cabinet.  September 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 242 (36).CABINET.PALESTINE  SITUATION.  PROPOSED NEGOTIATIONS BY LORD WINTERTON AND SIR  HERBERT SAMUEL.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the  Colonies.    I CIRCULATE  herewith a  copy of Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s  reply to my telegram of the 14th September (printed as Appendix II to.CP. 241 (36)), inwhich I asked for his views on the proposed negotiations of Lord Winterton andSir Herbert Samuel with Nuri Pasha.                                               (Initialled)       W. O.  G.    Colonial Office, Downina Street,          September 16, 1936.Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State                    for the Colonies, September 15, 1936.    IMMEDIATE.  Private and Personal.    Your private  and personal telegram  of  14th September.   My detailedcomments on  Sir Herbert  SamueVs proposals  enclosed with  your letter  of8th September will be submitted by air mail.  Meanwhile, my opinion is that theseproposals are so reasonable as to be much more likely to be ultimately acceptable tothe Arabs than to any but a few British Jews.  I feel sure that the principle ofarbitrary limitation of immigration, in particular, would never  be concededvoluntarily,  and that nearly all Jews would, indeed,  vehemently  oppose it.    2.   Although it is presumably  doubtful whether Samuel  has  any mandatefrom the Jewish  Agency and  Nuri  has no authority to speak on behalf of theArabs of Palestine,  the proposed discussions in Paris are unlikely to do harmand, provided that His Majesty&apos;s  Government associate themselves  therewithneither officially nor unofficially, they might even eventually  do good.  Samuel&apos;sintervention would, of  course,  be of much greater value if one could be  assured that he had Weizmann&apos;s backing.  I  have always foreseen that discussions between  responsible Arabs  and Jews would  be  desirable  after  the   RoyalCommission has  reported  and,  if  practicable,  they would prove  a  usefulpreliminary to any lasting settlement. Discussions before the Royal commission has reported, and between Arabs and Jews whose representative status is at leastdoubtful, are unlikely to do more than possibly clear the air.    Such discussions, in the present unaccommodating temper of both Arabs and Jews, could neither  produce an agreement nor contribute towards a better feeling between  the  two races.  If  at a time when  His Majesty&apos;s Government  are committed to policy of the Royal Commission they were  to associate themselves      [13803]
with Paris discussions, it might well be suspected by the Arabs that the real objectof-the -discussions was to find a  means -by which, enquiry by Royal ^Commission,which is known to be unwelcome to the Jews, could be avoided. /t 3. ; The clear and  definite  issue by which the Arabs of Palestine are atpresent faced either to capitulate unconditionally or to continue the disorders- - -would be obscured, and the situation would be undesirably complicated  if. 1 were instructed to inform the Arab leaders of the negotiations between Samuel andNuri.  Nuri himself would,  incidentally, probably be discredited.   Any such communication from me would  merely  produce further procrastination on thepart of Arab leaders, by whom this new factor (however much they might suspectit as a Jewish manoeuvre) would be seized upon as an excuse to postpone a decisionon the issue with which they are now confronted.
