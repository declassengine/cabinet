THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  August 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.^ &apos;CP. 228  (36).CABINET.REFORM  OF  THE  LEAGUE  OF  NATIONS.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the draft of the basis for the speech of theUnited Kingdom delegate  at the forthcoming  meeting of the  Assembly.  this draft has been  revised in the light of the discussion  at  the Foreign PolicyCommittee of the Cabinet on the 26th August.                                                                    A. E.    August 28, 1936.    The underlying motive for the work on  which we are now engaged, of examining the Covenant and the procedure of its application, is the recent failureof the collective action of Members of the League to achieve the prime object forwhich it was undertaken.    The principal causes of the failure of the League in this instance are twofold:the lack of universality of the League itself, and its failure, for whatever reason,to play a more energetic and effective part in the earlier stages of the crisis.    The former of these  two  causes has  unfortunately  been operative to come degree ever since the inception  of  the League.   It  has been aggravated bydefections in  recent years; and the  authority  of  the  League has been  greatlyimpaired by the fact that its pronouncements do not have the  weight of a verdictof universal world opinion.  In all that we ma)^ do we should bear in mind thenecessity of winning the widest possible acceptance, so that we may reinvest theLeague to the greatest possible extent with that  universality which alone can give it full authority  and effect.   For it is clear  that in any crisis,  an early andunmistakable  indication  of world opinion must  inevitably carry  the  utmostweight,  and may avert the necessity of special measures to prevent or to arrest adisturbance of the peace.    If we examine the causes of the abstentions and defections from the League,we may find  that these are based on two principal objections:  first, that theCovenant  invites.  Signatories to assume obligations and  commitments which allthe Governments  of the world are not ready in present circumstances to accept,and secondly,  that the League stands,  so it is alleged, for the maintenance ofan  order of things with which some Governments are not content.    It would  therefore seem to be desirable to find some means of making the commitments more acceptable,  and more applicable to the realities of the world situation as it exists to-day, and of encouraging and facilitating the use of theLeague machinery for adapting situations to changing circumstance and  for the remedy of what may be recognised to be legitimate grievances.    The first  of  these two objects might be brought nearer  achievement if wecould find some method of enabling the League to intervene more effectively inthe early stages of a crisis than recent experience has shown to be possible.      8782   [13717]                                             -  -
     It is to be observed that the framers of the Covenant were wise in that they produced an elastic document which did not exclude any form  of action in an emergency.   Machinery should be devised  which would facilitate  the effective intervention of the League earlier  than is now to be expected in any dispute which arises.     The first paragraph of article 11 provides that &quot;any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations.&quot; This article therefore gives wide opportunity for useful action, but the activities of the Council have in the past,been hampered by the assumption that the rule of unanimity must  apply to this provision  of the Covenant, and that the consent of the parties  to the dispute is thus necessary before the Council can make any recommendation.     It is for consideration, therefore, whether the  Council  should not be given more latitude,  enabling it to  make  recommendations under  the  first paragraph, of article 11 without  the consent of the States in  controversy.   His Majesty&apos;s Government  attach importance to this  proposal.  If this  proposal were to find general acceptance, then in the examination of any case that arose, and in any steps which  such an examination might show  to be practicable and desirable, they would be prepared to play their full part.     It seems to them all-important that the members of the  Council should clearly express their views at an early stage, and should be asked to indicate the measures that they would be prepared to take to give effect to them.   Discussion of such measures  would show  clearly how far  the  Powers  represented  on  the Council would be prepared to intervene in any given case.  Discussion, indeed,  might not be confined to such measures as would be appropriate under article 11, though our object would be to make the operation of that article more effective than it hasbeen  in the past,  but  might extend in advance to  the further question of themeasures  which,  in case  of need,  might fall to be taken  subsequently under-article 16.  If  at the outset, or at an early  stage in the  dispute,  the parties are left in no doubt of the  will of  the Council and of the determination and ability of the Member States to enforce it, this must act as a powerful deterrent to any party contemplating aggression in violation of the  Covenant. And the earlier.such  party is brought to  realise the situation, the  easier  it will be for him tomodify his attitude, and to conform to what the Council may recommend.  Delay too often means that one or both of the  parties commit themselves to military preparations which become increasingly difficult to revoke,  and that the other Members  of  the  League are thus faced with  a situation in which  it is more difficult and more hazardous for them to intervene with effect.    Prom  this point of view  there is every advantage in  the  negotiation  of regional  pacts  devised to strengthen  general security.   One  of  the  great advantages of  regional pacts is that their terms are known in advance, as are the conditions in which they will apply.  The value of agreements for collectiveaction, as a deterrent to an aggressor, depends largely on the certainty that they will be applied.  The uncertainty of the operation of wider and  more  ambitious-schemes not only tempts an aggressor to hazard the risk  that they will not be operated, but it also encourages the possible victim of aggression to rely too much on assistance which may in fact not be forthcoming.   His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare in favour of  such regional pacts provided that they are  consistent with theCovenant.   It  is  for  consideration whether  they should  be submitted  to theCouncil  or  the Assembly for  approval.   Such  approval  should  perhaps  be dependent on compliance with certain conditions to be defined.  Under  such regional pacts those who were  parties to them would, of course, be free to assume definite obligations  beyond those at present  embodied  in the  Covenant.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  are resolved to  endeavour to negotiate such a pact  in respect of Western Europe.  .  As regards the second object to be aimed at,  namely, that  of encouraging and facilitating the use of League machinery for adapting situations to changed circumstances,  it  is true  that Article  19  of the  Covenant contemplates  the possibility of changes.  It  is not practicable  to propose  any alteration of its terms or of its scope.   It would plainly be impracticable, for example, to seek to give the  Assembly power to  impose changes against the wish of the parties concerned. But it may not be beyond the bounds of possibility to find some means
 of encouraging resort to that article.  A frank discussion of grievances may go some way towards removing misconceptions and checking tendentious propaganda, and a clear expression of opinion on the part of a great majority of the Assembly would undoubtedly  exert moral pressure in favour of the remedy of injustice.     So much for the question of the application of the Covenant.  In addition, there are certain further steps which might usefully be taken at the same time at Geneva in the interests of good international understanding.     Among the economic questions which tend to perpetuate, if they do not give rise to, international differences, there is one in particular on which there may &quot;be some misconception, if not, indeed, misrepresentation, and which appears ripe for discussion and enquiry.  This is the question of access to certain raw materials in regard to which some  observations were made by the United Kingdom Delegate in his speech at the last Assembly.  This is a matter  wfiich seems suitable for discussion  at  Geneva, and, indeed, for impartial  expert  enquiry  under  the auspices of the League on the lines suggested  by  Sir  S. Hoare,  and a first step in this direction might  well be taken at this  Assembly.     Secondly,  it might be thought desirable, and calculated to  remove a cause of misgiving, if the Covenant could be separated from the treaties of peace in which it now remains incorporated, and were to take the form of  a self-contained convention.     In the observations which they have made in regard to the Covenant and its working, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not wish to propose that the terms of the Covenant itself should be changed.  In their view, it is preferable  that the charter of the new international order which it is sought to establish should  remain intact.  The suggestions  which they have made are matters rather of interpreta- tion and of emphasis than of amendment.  Recent experience has taught us that a new review of the working of the League is called for, and the  Assembly itself has pointed out that various circumstances have prevented the full application of the  Covenant.   But, whatever is done,  it is, in  the view  of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government, essential to maintain the fundamental principles  underlying  the collective  organisation of peace which find expression in the  Covenant, namely, the prevention of war through the machinery for  the peaceful settlement  of disputes,  the  machinery for the adjustment  of grievances,  the creation of a deterrent  to war and  the establishment  of  an international agreement for  the reduction and limitation  of armaments.     If  His M.aiesty&apos;s Government have laid  special emphasis  on two  of  the aspects of the League&apos;s activity by advocating, first, the earliest possible examina-tion  and  determination  of  the  extent  to  which the  League&apos;s  peace-keeping functions, whether persuasive, precautionary or coercive, are  to  be exercised in any given case, and, secondly, the early  ventilation of  grievances,  it is because these seem in the present  circumstances the best designed to lead to useful results.
