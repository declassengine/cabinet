The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening  of Parliament.NOVEMBER 3RD, 1936.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF  COMMONS :    MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.    The policy of My Government continues  to be based upon membership of theLeague of&apos; Nations.  They desire to see the League strengthened for its work inthe pacific  settlement of international disputes, and they have already made known at Geneva their proposals for the improved working and wider authorityof the League.  My Government will co-operate with other Governments in thework of the Committee of the League which, has been set up to examine these andother proposals.    My Government will continue to do all in their power to further the appease-ment of Europe.  With this object in  view  they will persist in their efforts tobring  about a meeting  between the  Five Powers signatory to  the Treaty .of locarno.    I trust that, as a result of the negotiations at present in progress, the treaty for the  limitation  of  naval  armaments,  which  was  signed in  London onMarch 25th by representatives  of  the  United States of America,  France, theUnited Kingdom, Canada,  the  Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand andIndia, will form the basis of an international agreement to which all naval PowersAvill eventually become parties.    My Government have followed with concern the political situation in  the far east, where peace and tranquillity are  so essential  to the important interests ofMy people in that part of the world.  It is My hope that the negotiations now inprogress between China and Japan may result in  a satisfactory solution.    My Ministers,  while maintaining their  determination to support the inter-national agreement  for  non-intervention in  Spain, will continue  to take every opportunity to mitigate human suffering and loss of life in that unhappy country.    I trust that before the end  of the present year the Treaty of Alliance with egypt will have been ratified by Myself and  the King of Egypt, and that it will prove to be the means of loyal  co-operation  between our two Governments and peoples whose destinies are inseparably bound together by common  aims  and interests.    A meeting of the Imperial Conference is to be held in London next May, andI  am confident  that  the opportunity thus  afforded for  discussions between representatives of My several Governments  will once more prove its value in promoting a closer  understanding  between all My peoples.  I am  glad to thinkthat this meeting will coincide in time with the occasion of My Coronation.    It is My hope, when the solemnity of My Coronation has been celebrated,to revisit My Indian Dominions and there to make known in  the same manner as My revered Father to the Princes and Peoples of India My succession to theImperial  Crown.    You will be asked to approve the  drafts of  various instruments which arerequired to implement your decision  that the provisions of  the Government ofIndia Act affecting  the  Provinces and  of the Government of Burma  Act shall come into operation  in April  next.   I have  every  confidence that the greatresponsibilities which will devolve upon  the representatives of the people of Indiaand of Burma will be faithfully and effectively discharged.                                                                  13999A
,  .-1;deeply- regret, the serious, disturbances which have taken place in Palestine du.r;ing the last;six months, and which made it-necessary to despatch additional. troops.  I  welcome the recept, improvement. ,-i&apos;pi the situation  and , the Royal Commission, which I have appointed, will leave England this week to,undertake their inquiry.  I sincerely  trust that their examination of the very  difficult problems which will come  before  them will  lead to a  just  and  permanent settlement.         &quot;MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS :    The Estimates for the Public Services will be laid before you.    The work of strengthening My defence forces  is being pressed on with theutmost energy and is now making rapid progress.   My Government are satisfiedthat the measures they are taking are essential to the defence of My Empire andto the ability of this  country to  discharge its international obligations.,  my ministers will nevertheless lose no opportunity of promoting general internationalappeasement and  the  limitation of expenditure on armaments which would naturally follow upon  such an improvement of relations.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS :    I am gratified to note that the general trade and industrial outlook continuesto be favourable,  and that there is good ground for  expecting that there will befurther improvement.  My Ministers will continue  to foster industrial activityat home and, in the belief that the attainment of general prosperity here depends on further expansion of  our overseas trade, to  maintain their efforts to promote the freer exchange of goods throughout the world.    You will be invited  to extend the period of operation of the  Special Areas(Development and Improvement) Act, 1984.    The position of the shipping industry is receiving the careful considerationof My  Ministers, with a view to deciding what measures  are required to securethe maintenance of a mercantile marine adequate for the needs of  the country.    You  will  be  invited  to  consider  proposals for  the  furtherance  of re-organisation in the coal industry, and  for  the unification  of  coal royaltiesunder national control.    My Ministers have  come to  the conclusion that the existing law requiresamendment in order to deal more effectively with persons or organisations whoprovoke or cause disturbances of the public peace.  A Bill for strengthening thelaw without  interfering  with legitimate freedom  of speech or assembly will besubmitted to  you.    The present  law regulating the conditions of  work in factories is  basedupon the Act of 1901, and though  it has from time to  time  been modified incertain particulars, further amendment  and  consolidation are  long  overdue.My Ministers intend  to invite Parliament  to undertake and carry through this important task in the course of the present Session.    My Ministers will continue to promote by  an  active and constructive policy the development of home agriculture and fisheries.   The position of the livestockindustry has been  engaging  their  close  attention  and  legislation  will  beintroduced to promote increased efficiency  in that industry and to provide forassistance to the producers of fat cattle.    A Bill will  be introduced  with a view  to transferring  from  the countycouncils to the Minister  of  Transport the principal roads which  constitute thenational system of through traffic routes in Great Britain.    I am impressed with the need for more comprehensive efforts to improve the physical condition of the nation, especially among the younger members of thecommunity, and My Ministers will in due course submit to you proposals designedto carry out this purpose.
    Encouragement will continue to-be given to the development of&apos;the&apos; existingpublic  health  services.   Vigorous&apos;  action  for  the  provision  of  housing accommodation:&apos; to  replace  slum  dwellings and abate  overcrowding  will bemaintained.          1  iv 1     - f^! i&apos;i -&apos;     M       &apos;  *   &apos;  &quot; ;&apos; 1    &quot;&apos; &quot; &quot; -    Legislation will be. introduced. to provide medical care for young, personswho have left school and entered employment,  and to extend  to  persons  withlimited income voluntary insurance for the purpose of pensions.

A Bill will also be laid before you to remove certain anomalies in the presentstanding of Ministers by adjustments and alterations in  their salaries, and forother purposes.    Close attention will continue to be given to the improvement  of conditionsin Scotland.   My Ministers are examining the Report  of the Committee onScottish Health Services and  among measures relating to health a Bill for thedevelopment  of  Scottish  maternity , services  will be  introduced.
