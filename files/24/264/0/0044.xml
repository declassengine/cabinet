SECRET.                                                         Copy No.   44CP. 269  (36).CABINET.PALESTINE  SITUATION:   QUESTION  OF  TEMPORARY              SUSPENSION  OF  IMMIGRATION.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    IN the Memorandum to the Cabinet (CP. 260 (36)) of the 10th October, 1936,I circulated the text of a despatch from the High Commissioner for  Palestine,in which he discussed the  important question of  the temporary suspension  of immigration.                         Recent Public Statements.    2.   When the question of suspension of  immigration was raised with me  onthe 14th July last at an interview Which I gave to Jemal Bey Husseini and three other Arab gentlemen, I informed them  that after order had been restored theGovernment would consider, when the Royal Commission started for  Palestine,whether immigration should or should not be suspended during the Commission^enquiry, but I gave them no undertaking that there  would be  any suspension;and, as my colleagues  may recollect, I informed Mr. David Adams in the Houseof Commons on the 22nd July last  that, as regards  the  suggestion that thereshould  be a temporary suspension  of immigration while the  Palestine RoyalCommission was carrying out its enquiry, I  was not at  present in a position  tomake any statement as to the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government beyondsaying  that their decision would  be taken in due course on the merits  of thecase, and that there was no question of it being influenced by violence or attempts at intimidation.    At their meeting on the 2nd September last the Cabinet reached the conclusionthat no decision should be taken at that time  regarding the temporary suspension of permanent immigration into Palestine.    3.   If  the disorders in Palestine had continued, the question of temporary suspension  would not arise, and the High Commissioner would no doubt  have authorised  such a labour schedule (i.e.,  the half-yearly schedule by which the immigration of wage-earners is mainly  regulated) for  the six months&apos;  periodOctober to March as he considered appropriate.   But the Arab strike was calledoff on the 12th October, and it appears that the disorders are, in fact, at an end.although there may still be minor  incidents. In these circumstances, it  shouldbe possible for the  Royal  Commission to sail for Palestine in the very  nearfuture  (accommodation is being reserved for them by the s.s.  Cathay, leavingMarseilles on the 6th November), and  I feel justified, therefore, in raising withoutfurther delay the question of the temporary  suspension of immigration pendingthe completion of the Royal Commission^ enquiry and the consideration of theirreport  by His Majesty&apos;s Government, with a view to a definite decision now beingtaken.                           Formal  Commitments.    4.   To facilitate  consideration of this  question it  will be convenient  first to recall the commitments  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to jewish immigration.  These  have already been set out in  the Cabinet Memorandum            Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1936.
 circulated  by  my  predecessor,  Lord  Swinton,  on  the 23rd March,  1932 (CP.  115  (32)) and in the Appendix to that paper.  Briefly,  they  are as follows :  Mandate.     (a) Under the Mandate, to facilitate Jewish immigration under  suitable conditions,  while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced; 1922 Statement of Policy.     (b) By the 1922 Statement of Policy, to ensure that the volume of immigration does not exceed the economic capacity of the country to absorb new arrivals; 1930 Statement of Policy.   Prime  Ministers Letter to Dr.  Weizmann of the         13th February, 1931.     (c) Under the  1930 White Paper, as interpreted  by  the Prime Minister^ letter to Dr. Weizmann, to maintain the principle of absorptive capacity, in the determination  of  which purely  economic considerations  are  alone relevant; Government control  of  immigration;  and the  proper  application  of  the Immigration Regulations.  The principle is accepted that in all works or under- takings carried out or furthered by the Jewish Agency, Jewish labour  shall be employed.   But if, in consequence  of this policy, Arab labour  is displaced or existing unemployment  becomes  aggravated, that  is  a  factor to which  His Majesty&apos;s Government  are bound to have  regard.  In the case of public  and municipal works falling to be financed out of public funds, the  claim of Jewish labour to a due share of the employment available,  taking into account Jewish contributions to public revenue, is to be taken into consideration.   Finally, the desirability is admitted of closer co-operation and consultation between the Jewish authorities and the Palestine Government, especially in regard to the preparation of the Labour Schedule.    5.  A further commitment  on an important point of  detail  is contained in the statement made by Mr. Thomas,  when Secretary of State for the Colonies, in the House of Commons, on  the 24th  March last, that the suggested increase from  1,000 to  2,000 in the minimum capital qualifying for unrestricted entry of an immigrant into Palestine would not be proceeded with.    6.  A further commitment is  involved in the statement which I made in the House of Commons in my speech  on the Colonial Office Vote on the 19th June last that  His Majesty&apos;s Government can contemplate  no  &quot;change of policy&quot; whatsoever  until they have  received and considered the  report of the Royal Commission.                     Description of Policy and Procedure.    7.  The policy of Government in regulating immigration into Palestine is, in brief, that immigration shall be regulated according to the economic capacity of the country to absorb the immigrants who are admitted.  The legislative expression of this policy is the Palestine Immigration Ordinance of  1933, which consolidated and amended  previous Ordinances.  Under  this  Ordinance  the volume of immigration  has consisted for the most part of immigrants in three categories, namely :     (1) Capitalists with at least  1,000 (Category A (i)), and their dependants;    (2) Immigrants with definite  prospects of employment, entering under  the           labour schedule (Category C), and their dependants; and    (3) Dependants of persons already legally resident in Palestine (Category D).    There are several other categories of immigrants  under the Ordinance,  but most of them are at present closed for economic reasons and, where they  are  not closed, the  immigrants  are  admitted on financial guarantees  of persons  or institutions in Palestine competent to give those guarantees.   The great  bulk of immigrants into  Palestine  are, of course, Jews, but the  provisions  of  the Immigration Ordinance  and its regulations make no distinction between Jews and others  as regards  their  admission into  Palestine, except  in  so  far as  special machinery is provided to facilitate the entry of Jewish wage-earners under  the labour schedule.
     8. .  The  labour  schedule  (Category  C)  is  determined  by  the  High Commissioner  half-yearly  in  April  and  October.   The  practice  is  for  the Jewish Agency for Palestine to submit to the Palestine Department of Migration a reasoned estimate of the number of immigration certificates required for Jewish wage-earners throughout Palestine during the coming half year.  This estimate is checked by the Department of Migration in the light of information based on its own  independent  enquiries, and  after further  discussion  between repre- sentatives of the Department and of the Agency a recommendation is made by the Commissioner for Migration to the High Commissioner. On this recommendation the High Commissioner takes his  decision, having regard  not  only to factors bearing upon the immediate requirements for the half year,  but upon considera- tions of  longer range  in so far as  he  may  consider them to be relevant.  It is, however, important to stress the point that the considerations involved, whether of short range  or&apos; of longer range,  are purely economic  considerations.   On reaching his decision  the High Commissioner causes  the  Jewish Agency to be informed of the number of certificates Under the labour schedule which will be placed at their disposal for  the half year.  This information is also published in the Palestine  Government Gazette.  As might be expected,  the  Jewish Agency has always  shown a tendency to take a more optimistic view than the Palestine Government of the requirements of the  Jewish  labour market in Palestine,  but although the High Commissioner^ decision has often enough been received by the Jews with disappointment and expressions of criticism, I have no reason to think that responsible  Jewish  opinion  has at  any time regarded the  High  Com- missioner&apos;s  decision as being influenced by considerations other than economic ones.  Frequent statements have been made by my predecessors to the effect that it is for the High Commissioner and not for  the Colonial Office to fix the figure.                      Jewish Immigration during 1936.    9.   The High Commissioner authorised in May a labour  schedule of 4,500 in respect of the period April-September of this year, despite the Arab agitation for the total  suspension of immigration which accompanied the  disorders then widely prevalent in Palestine.    10.   I attach to this Memorandum (Appendix I) a statement setting out the figures of Jewish immigration into Palestine during 1936, down to the end of September, which is the latest available date, with figures for the corresponding months of the previous year, and also  a statement showing the number of Jews in the principal immigration categories referred to above.  These figures present two noteworthy features :      (1) Jewish immigration into Palestine  already showed a considerable falling           off, as compared  with the corresponding period of 1935, even before           the outbreak of the disturbances in April.    (2) Despite the widespread  nature of the disturbances Jewish immigration          has continued steadily, and rose  in the month of September to 4,695,          which is far larger than the figures for any  other month  during  1936.           The increased figure is  believed to be due  to the fear of a possible           suspension of immigration after the end of September; and it is under-          stood  that  Zionist  authorities  have encouraged  all  prospective          immigrants who have been granted immigration certificates in the past          to proceed to Palestine immediately.                 Jewish View on Suspension  of Immigration.    11.   It has become  increasingly  clear during the  past few months thatJewish opinion throughout the world is very strongly opposed to  any temporary suspension  of  immigration.  This  opposition has been  expressed  not  only  byZionists and by influential sympathisers with Zionism such as  General Smuts,but also  by such moderate-minded Jews as  Mr.  Anthony de Rothschild and.Sir Osmond d&apos;Avigdor-Goldsmid interested more particularly in the settlementof Jewish refugees  from persecution in Central Europe.   It may be noted thatthe Jewish  opposition to suspension  has not been concerned merely with thepossibility of suspension being resorted  to as a means of  bringing  disorder toan end,  but is  directed with almost equal force against any suspension at  allduring the  enquiry  by  the Royal Commission.
                 Arab View on Suspension of Immigration.     12.   On the other hand, Arab  opinion has, up till recently, expressed itself equally strongly in  favour of suspension, which has been urged upon Government by the Arabs in Palestine, including Arab members of the Palestine Civil Service who made this point in the memorial which they addressed to me in July last.                           -  Jewish Arguments.     13.   The Jewish arguments may be summarised briefly as follows :  Such a suspension would be taken  by  the Jewish people  as a  new  challenge  to the status quo whereby Jews enter Palestine as  a right subject only to economic limitation, and would be regarded by  them as inconsistent with Mr.  Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s letter  to Dr. Weizmann in 1931.  It would destroy the confidence of the Jews in the  Royal Commission as an independent body of high standing (i.e..  suspension  would be  regarded as  giving a  &quot; directive&quot; to  the  Royal Commission and  as a hint of the conclusions which His Majesty&apos;s Government would wish the Commission to  reach).   It  is further argued that it would be very difficult for  the Commission to accept responsibility for recommending any resumption of immigration if it had been suspended at the time when they began their enquiry, and it would create a  formidable, perhaps an insuperable, difficulty for the co-operation of the Jewish Agency in the enquiry to be held by the Royal Commission.   Moreover, it is argued  that such  suspension would  lower the prestige  of  the British Government in the eyes of the  Jewish people and do irreparable damage to that attitude of trust and goodwill towards the Mandatory Power which  the Jewish  Agency professes  to be  so anxious to see maintained amongst  the Jews in Palestine  and throughout the world.  In a conversation which I  had with Dr. Weizmann on the 31st August, Dr.  Weizmann showed himself extremely hostile to any suspension whatsoever. He remarked that eight weeks before he had himself personally suggested to me that the Jewish Agency would be willing, in  the  hope of  easing the then situation and bringing the disorders to an end, to refrain from asking for a labour  schedule for the next six months, and if this suggestion had been seriously considered he had no doubt that the  Jewish  Agency  would then have been prepared, if pressed  by  His Majesty&apos;s Government, to acquiesce in  the temporary exclusion  of a certain number of (though not all) immigrants of  other  categories.  This  suggestion,however which,  I may say in parenthesis,  had been made  rather vaguely and tentatively had, Dr.  Weizmann said,  been &quot;brushed aside&quot; by me, and  since then, he  went on  to say, more and more Jews had  been murdered and more andmore  Jewish property  had been  destroyed and  it was obviously  too late now to revert to this tentative proposal which, according to Dr. Weizmann&apos;s impression, had  received so little encouragement when made in May.  This attitude is, of course, only what might be  expected.  Any  closing, even for a short  period, of the door, more particularly  against Jewish immigration  from  Germany  and Poland,  cannot but be viewed by the Jews with abhorrence and alarm, which must be felt all the more strongly in  view of the increasing political and economic disabilities under which Jews in these two countries are at present suffering. Something like a third of the total number of Jewish refugees from Germany have, I believe, already gone to Palestine and the outcry which may be expected in the event of temporary suspension  of  immigration would be particularly loud and  bitter on the part of  German  Jews  and  their numerous sympathisers.         Special Arrangements regarding German Jews with Capital.    14.  As  regards  German Jews, it  should be noted  that, by  a  special arrangement approved by the German Government,  German Jews with capital have in the past been afforded facilities for transferring to Palestine the minimum capital  qualifying  for  entry as immigrants  under  Category A (i).  Owing, however, to the progressive shrinkage in the amount of foreign currency, including sterling,  available in Germany, the Jews have found increasing difficulty in effecting  the transfer of the minimum capital required.  As such facilities as are still available  for the transfer  of  capital  appear to be dependent  upon the purchase by Palestine of more than the equivalent amount of German goods, it
 would, I think, be fair to say that an arrangement which began as a concession to the Jews now operates to the advantage of Germany inasmuch as it facilitates the export of German goods.     A fuller statement of the position in regard to the transfer of Jewish capital from Germany to  Palestine is given in Appendix II to this Memorandum.     It may  be noted  that somewhat  similar  restrictions  on  the  export of immigrants&apos; capital  from Poland to Palestine were introduced in April 1936. Restrictions are  also in  force partly or  wholly in  other  Central and  East European countries.                    A attitude of Opposition in Parliament.     15.  Not only may we expect determined opposition from the Jews them- selves,  but  I have been warned by Mr. Attlee that the Labour  Opposition in Parliament will give strong support to the Jewish representations if immigration is  suspended, and I  have no doubt that the Jewish  case  will find many active sympathisers among  the  Governments supporters as well.                   Possible  Reaction in Foreign Countries.     16.   In the international sphere it is necessary to bear in mind the agitation which is  likely  to be organised by the Jews in  the  United States of America, where they are able to exert considerable influence upon the Press and in other respects, while at  Geneva the Jews  have in the past  been able to arouse hostile criticism  against His Majesty&apos;s Government when they wished to do so,  and in present circumstances, Poland, with its large Jewish population and the interest which it has frequently expressed at Geneva and elsewhere in promoting  Jewish immigration from  Poland into Palestine, may be expected to give strong support to Jewish attacks  upon the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.                             Arab Arguments.    17.  On the  other hand, whatever  their  attitude  to-day, there has been undoubtedly a very strong feeling on the part of the Arabs in  favour  of  the complete  suspension  of  Jewish immigration,  at any rate  until  the  Royal Commission has reported and decisions have been taken upon its recommendations. In urging suspension  the Palestine Arabs have been supported in  Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Transjordan,  and to  some extent also in Egypt; and the Moslems of India, who already have sent  a deputation to the Viceroy on the subject of British policy in Palestine, may be expected to fall into line with Moslem opinion elsewhere over this question  if they have not done so already.    18.  The Arab argument in favour of a suspension of immigration may be put briefly as follows  : The professed policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government that immigration  shall  not exceed economic absorptive capacity has not in practice been carried  out.  Immigration  in 1925 and 1926 was found to be excessive and led to serious economic difficulties, but in spite of this warning, the Government has permitted Jewish immigration to proceed  without effective check at a  far greater rate than before, and in  1935 it had reached such proportions as to cause widespread alarm  amongst the Arabs.  Apart from what they profess to regard as the grave economic dangers of  such a rapid flow  of immigration,  the Arab argument is  that the  rights and position of the  Arab community  in Palestine, which  the Mandate professes to safeguard, are being progressively  threatened by the recent increase in the Jewish population, which, if allowed to continue at anything like its present  rate, will,  in the not distant future, turn the present Arab  majority into a minority.  The Arabs not  unnaturally feel  that once  the Jews become a majority in Palestine they will  be able to exercise such effective pressure that the political and social position of the Arabs will be, to all intents and purposes, destroyed, and they will become a subject race.  The Arabs further argue  that  all  warnings  and   recommendations  of  previous Commissions   of Enquiry, in so far as they have  favoured the Arab case, have been disregarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government under Jewish pressure, and that consequently they are unable to hope  that, even if the Royal  Commission  were to make recommenda-tions  which  would in Arab opinion do  them justice,  these recommendations
 would be carried into effect if, as would probably be the case, they were regarded by the Jews  as  contrary  to  their own interests.   They therefore urge that a &quot; gesture &quot; should be  made  which would reassure Arab  opinion of the good intentions of  His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the sincerity of their expressed intention to administer Palestine with justice  and equity  to Jew and  non-Jew alike.   The Arab view appears to be that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to suspend immigration pending the investigation of  the Royal Commission and consideration by the Government  of their report, it -would show the  world that they were able, as well  as willing, to take a decision and to abide by it,  notwith- standing strong Jewish and Parliamentary opposition, and  that this  fact would give some assurance to the Arabs that they could rely  upon the British Govern- ment to give effect to any recommendations made by the Royal Commission with a view to safeguarding Arab interests which the Government might consider were justified upon the merits of the case.                        High Commissioner&apos;s  Views.    19.   Sir  Arthur   Wauchope&apos;s  view  of  this  difficult  question has  not unnaturally varied with the changing circumstances  of the situation in Palestine. I would invite attention to his despatch of the 1st October, the text of which has already been circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 280 (36) of the 10th October).   As will be seen, the High Commissioners conclusion in that despatch was  that, while temporary suspension  of immigration  might possibly  be justified for political reasons, he was satisfied that it could not be defended certainly not publicly on those  grounds, and that it certainly was not at present justifiable on economic grounds.  Telegraphing on the 19th October, Sir Arthur Wauchope states that he- sees no reason to vary the view expressed in that despatch.  In the same telegram he expresses the view that, if there is no suspension of immigration, the  Arabs will be keenly disappointed at what they will represent as another triumph of Jewish influence, and they may conceivably boycott the Royal Commission,  but he thinks this an  unlikely result of the grant of a labour schedule. He does not anticipate that Arab disappointment will lead to a resumption of disorder.    The High Commissioner adds that there is still  a general expectation among the Arabs that immigration will be suspended, but that they are not so confident of suspension  now as they  were two months ago, and the Jews are  certainly less apprehensive of it than they were.    The grant of a small labour schedule would, in  Sir A. Wauchope&apos;s opinion. tend to mitigate  Arab  disappointment to the extent to which it evokes strong public protest from the Jews, who anticipate a large schedule.                              Economic Aspect.    20.  From the economic point of view there is, of course, a long term as well as a short term aspect.   As regards the short term aspect of the problem,  I see no reason to question the  conclusion arrived at by  the High Commissioner  and his advisers that  a substantial labour schedule  for  the  October  half year would be economically justified, and  the High Commissioner is not at present prepared to recommend any restriction  upon the entry of immigrants in  Category  A (i), i.e., those possessed of a minimum capital of  1,000.  As  regards the long term aspect of the problem, I feel that sufficient data are not yet available which would enable any definite opinion to  be  expressed as to the effects in, say,  five years&apos;  time of continued  immigration  into Palestine regulated in accordance with existingmethods.   Unless, therefore,  there  should  be  some important change  in  the economic conditions and outlook of Palestine in the immediate future, the only grounds upon which it would appear  to be possible to defend a suspension of immigration must be purely political grounds.                           Other Considerations.    21.&apos;  Everyone in contact  with the Arabs  tells  us that  it is  desirable,  ifpossible, to make some political &quot; gesture &quot; to the Arab world.  It has been madeperfectly clear that suspension would not be given as a quid pro quo  in return forcalling off the strike.  But  I fear that  inevitably it would be said that although
the disorders are at an end we have, in fact, conceded to violence and agitationthat which we have hitherto been unwilling to concede to reason.  And since the intervention of the Arab kings it will be said that we came to some bargain orunderstanding with them on this question.    22,  If His Majesty&apos;s Government decide not to suspend, it is not merely aquestion of quietly letting existing regulations stand, but it involves the public announcement, in the course of a week or two, of a labour schedule for the currenthalf-year, which began on the 1st October.   As a matter of  fact,  the jewish agency have already put in  an application  for  a labour  schedule  of 10,695.Reporting  on the 19th October  the High  Commissioner states that the  Com-missioner for Migration,  having completed his  survey  of economic prospects,recommends a schedule of 2,100  certificates, 500 of which would be retained byhis department as a reserve.  While the High Commissioner had not yet had timeto consider this proposal he does not expect that he will feel able to support alarger schedule and may possibly advocate some reduction.    23.  Suspension of  the labour  schedule  only would be  free  from the objection that the flow of immigrant capital would be violently interrupted.  Thefact  that immigration would continue in the other  categories, which  (excludingdependants on already admitted immigrants under the labour category) accountedfor more than half the  immigrants in 1935, would to some extent mollify Jewishcriticism.  Such limited suspension could be  defended by the action taken on previous occasions more easily than could failure to follow these precedents.                    A ction taken  on Previous Occasions.    24.  The only two cases which are at all relevant are     (a)  The action of Sir Herbert Samuel in 1921.    (b)  The  action of  Sir John Chancellor  in 1930.    25. (a)  The facts regarding Sir Herbert Samuel&apos;s action  are as follows :The disturbances began in Jaffa on the 1st May, 1921, and continued for  abouta week.  They  were followed by  sporadic  anti-Jewish manifestations, which appeared in Jaffa during June and July.    On the 4th May Sir Herbert  Samuel requested the High  Commissioner inEgypt to arrange that immigrants on the way to Palestine should be temporarilyaccommodated in Egypt.  Subsequently arrangements were  made for  some ofthese unfortunate people to be returned instead to their ports of embarkation, andarrangements were made through the Zionist Commission (some time before the9th May) for immigration to be suspended at its source until further notice.    On the  24th May  the  High  Commissioner indicated  that suspension of immigration  should not apply  to  travellers,  persons  of independent  means,members of professions, dependants  of residents in Palestine, and persons withcontracts of employment with specified employers.    It would appear, therefore, that the total suspension of immigration was for only  a few weeks, and  that subsequently a system of classification was adoptedwhich formed the basis from which  the present system of immigration control bycategories has developed.    26. (6)  The action of Sir John Chancellor in 1930 was quite different.  Inthat case a certain number of immigration certificates under the labour schedulewere suspended  in May 1930,  and this suspension,  in the words of the annual report for that year,  &apos; was solely an act of ordinary prudence dictated by theknowledge  that a special investigation was about to be carried  out into thequestion of immigration into Palestine  [i.e., Sir John Hope-Simpson&apos;s  Corn-mission], and by the view that  it would be economically advisable to hold theissue of these certificates in suspense until that investigation had been completed.The question of the immigration of working-men was further considered in thelatter part of the year, and  1,480  immigration certificates were authorised inOctober 1930.&quot;  It may be remarked that Sir  John Chancellor had himselfapproved a labour schedule of 3,300 for the half-year ending the 30th September,1930.   In taking this decision the  High Commissioner was apparently unaware of the fact that the then Prime Minister, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, had informed
 the Arab delegation then in England that the High  Commissioner  was being consulted as to the possibility of suspending immigration temporarily pending the result of the Hope-Simpson Commission.  The decision finally reached was to suspend temporarily the issue of those certificates  over  and above the advance instalment of 950 which had already been issued.   --..27.   The decision to suspend immigration for a short time in  1921  was taken at. a time when the country was still in a disturbed state, but  it must be remembered that the arrangements for the control of immigration into Palestine were then only rudimentary.  After  a few weeks  steps were  taken  to resume immigration regulated  according to  definite categories.   There is  nothing to suggest that the temporary  suspension took place to enable an  investigation to be made of Arab grievances or of the absorptive capacity of the country.     In the 1930 case on the other  hand, while the temporary suspension  was limited to the labour schedule, it was definitely related to the question  of investi- gating the general problem  of immigration.  But this decision was taken long after  the disturbances in 1929 were  over  and  had been reported upon by the Shaw Commission.                        Preservation of the Status Quo.     28.  An important point for consideration  is the question of preserving the status quo during the deliberations of the Royal Commission.  This can be argued in two ways.  The  Jewish argument is that to suspend immigration temporarily during the deliberations of the Royal Commission would be to introduce a change in the status quo which  the Commission has been called upon to investigate  and that a continuing Jewish immigration is an essential element of the  status  quo of Palestine.   It is urged that the  right  and  just solution is for  matters to remain in- statu quo ante till the Government decide, as a result of the information received  from the Royal Commission, what new  condition of affairs is  to persist, i.e., that the principle of permitting Jewish immigration to continue in accordance with  economic  absorptive capacity should be preserved unless and until it  has been  successfully challenged as a  result  of the investigations of   the Royal Commission.  On the other hand,  it can be argued that the preservation of the status quo involves that  the Arab  and Jewish populations should be maintained during the period of review by the Royal  Commission as they  are to-day save- in so far as natural increase may change  their relative proportions; hence all immigration, Jewish or Arab, should be suspended, and in particular a principle such as that of economic absorptive  capacity should  not be permitted  to operate to disturb those proportions  in case  the Royal Commission  may  recommend any variation of the  principle.            Consideration of Partial Restriction of Imjmigration.    29.  As distinct from a total suspension of immigration there is the question whether there is any partial restriction which would be practicable and desirable, i.e., whether an arbitrary figure should be fixed within which immigration under one or more categories should be permitted pending decisions by His  Majesty&apos;s- Government on the recommendations of the Royal Commission.   I do  not think there is much to be said in favour  of this possible alternative.  It  would  not impress the Arabs,  who  would see some Jewish  immigration continuing despite their  demand for its suspension and would almost certainly claim that  the figure fixed was far too high.  On the other hand, in so  far as the fixing of an arbitrary figure would be an  avowed departure from the principle of economic absorptive capacity, it would be met with a loud outcry from the Jews Avhc would  regard it, even if the figure was fixed fairly high,  as endangering  what is to them  the all-important principle embodied in Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s letter of February 1931,  and thereby prejudicing consideration of the wmole problem by  the Royal Commission, even though some similar restriction were placed concurrently uponArab  immigration.  Moreover, to give practical effect to such a restriction would be very difficult except in the case of the labour schedule, and as regards the labourschedule, it is open to the High Commissioner  to take a conservative view of theabsorptive capacity, and  indeed in the present uncertain circumstances it seems clear, as  indicated in paragraph 22,  that he will feel bound to do so.
Colonial Office, Downing Street,       October 20,  1936.                                 Conclusion.     30.  I have tried  in this memorandum to set out all the relevant facts andconsiderations  for  reaching a  decision  on this very difficult  question.  Theconclusion  a,t which I arrive, after carefully reviewing the position, is that atemporary  suspension  of immigration while the Royal Commission  is at workand  their report is under consideration would not be  justified, and I  recommendthat I  should  be authorised to  convey a decision  accordingly  to  the  HighCommissioner.  At the same time, it is, I consider, right that in present circum-stances  the High  Commissioner  should take  a definitely conservative view  in estimating  the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine for the purpose of fixing the Labour Schedule for the period October 1936 to March 1937, and I  recommendthat I should be authorised  to inform him accordingly.  I should  prefer not to specify  a figure, as I do not wish to depart from the practice which  has alwaysbeen followed of leaving the decision as to numbers  to the High Commissioner;it is, however, probable that on receipt of a general direction in the sense whichI have suggested, the High  Commissioner will fix the number of certificates forthe current Schedule at (say) 2,000, or even less.

A rrangements for Transfer of Jewish Capital from Germany to Palestine.     (1) Category A  (i).  The principal qualification is the bona fide possessionand free disposal of  P. 1,000.     At the advent of the Hitler Government in Germany there was little difficultyin transferring the qualifying  capital  to  Palestine.   The  prospective Jewishimmigrant was allowed by the Devisen-office to deposit the qualifying capital inthe Reichsbank, and this capital was quickly transferred to the Templar Bank inPalestine.   The operation resembled the purchase of  sterling in open market;since the foreign exchange market was not, in fact, open, the attitude  of  theGerman Government was, in effect, a great concession to German Jews in so  faras emigration to Palestine was concerned.     Parallel with this arrangement was a licence by the German Government toa kind of trust body in Palestine, &quot; Haavara,&quot; which, in conjunction with itsagent in Berlin, &quot; Paltreu,&quot; in close liaison with the Reichsbank and the GermanGovernment, was  empowered to  transfer,  on  the basis  of trade agreement,immigrants&apos;  capital  over  and above the qualifying  capital deposited in  the reichsbank.     Thus a German  Jew possessing, say,  5,000 and  proposing to emigrate to palestine, received  a permit  from the  Devisen-office to deposit  1,000 in  the reichsbank  for direct  transfer to the Templar Bank in  Palestine;  and was permitted, further, to deposit the remainder  of his capital ( 4,000) with Paltreu,to be sent to Palestine when Haavara  by trade arrangements  had broughtgoods in Germany to that  amount for export to Palestine, receiving  4,000 lesscharges (usually 20 per cent.), in sterling in Palestine when the operation had beencompleted.     In  1934 and 1935  the amount of  foreign currency,  including sterling,  inGermany shrank considerably.  In consequence the Reichsbank were less and lessable to make sterling available for  transfer to Palestine of the qualifying capitaldeposited with  them.  As a result  the list of depositors steadily lengthened, andthe time taken  to clear the deposit of any individual to Palestine became longerand  longer.   In September 1935 there were  at least 1,200 persons on the list atthe Reichsbank  who had no hope of transferring their capital to Palestine formany months,  and  who  therefore were not eligible to  receive  ImmigrationCertificates.
    German Jews, seeing this difficulty, then began to deposit qualifying capitalwith Paltreu, the agent of  Haavara, in the hope that Haavara&apos;s encouragementin Palestine of purchase of  goods in  Germany would give greater chances ofexpeditious transfer of the qualifying capital  to  Palestine than  were offeredunder the direct system of Reichsbank deposit and transfer.    But, in fact, Haavara and Paltreu  quickly came into the same position as the reichsbank; the sterling was  not available and the waiting list for qualifyingcapital deposited with Haavara grew as fast as the Reichsbank waiting list.    Hence there was almost complete stagnation in this form of emigration of jews from Germany to Palestine.    In September 1935  it was arranged that 500 deserving cases in the Reichs-bank list should be given facilities to enter Palestine, it being  understood thatthe Reichsbank would do their utmost to transfer their qualifying capital withintwelve months, and, in so far as the Reichsbank failed to transfer  the full amount,those  immigrants who  could  not  show that they had  received  their qualifyingcapital within the period, would become a charge to a Labour  Schedule.  This was done with the  consent of the  Jewish Agency,  to whom the greater part of theLabour Schedule is made available.    In view of the growing delay in the  transfer of capital from Germany, itis apparent that a large proportion of these 500 prospective immigrants will haveto be registered under the Labour Schedule.
