Nuri  Pasha  points out to  me this  morning  that  he will leave  here onWednesday  or Thursday next  for Jerusalem  en route  for Angora, where heintends to make every effort to enlist the collaboration of the Turkish Governmentin regard  to settlement of remaining 8,500 Assyrians who desire to leave Iraq.    He is most anxious whilst in Jerusalem, where he will stay two days, to do all he possibly can to help to  bring about restoration of normal conditions inPalestine and wishes to know urgently whether you think that his interventionat this stage will be useful.  He is much impressed by  the new conditions broughtabout by the happy issue of the Egyptian treaty negotiations  and successful conclusion of Montreux Conference, and  seems genuinely  anxious to pull suchweight as  he can with you.   He would speak to Arabs in Palestine as an Arab,and not as the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs.    Please telegraph your views urgently.    Repeated to  Foreign Office, telegram No. 201.[13711]B

J  &amp;                                    (3)  Cypher Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary                                 of State.                         Dated 22nd August,  1936.                   (Received 5-22 P.M. 22nd August, 1936.)    MOST Immediate.    Addressed to Colonial Office, No. 637.   Repeated to Bagdad, No. 981.    Bagdad telegram No.  21.  Repeated to Foreign Office, No. 201.    Nuri Pasha, after long talk with Mufti and principal members of SupremeArab Committee, is  hopeful that he  can persuade them  to call off strike anddisorders on basis of a memorandum  to be addressed by him to the Committee,the text  of which is  given in my immediately following telegram.  He does not propose to sign or dispatch the memorandum until the  Committee has definitelycommitted themselves to calling off the strike and disorders.  Nor does he proposethat his  Government should approach His Majesty&apos;s Government until action of supreme Arab Committee has proved effective.  The action proposed by Nuridoes not seem to go beyond  that  originally  contemplated  by Ibn Saud and approved by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government (see  your  telegram No. 318),  and i assume that I may be authorised to  tell Nuri  that His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentwould welcome intervention on lines  proposed; but I should be glad to receiveconfirmation.     Owing to rapid deterioration of situation in Palestine, and the fact thatNuri&apos;s stay in this part of the Middle East is  limited, I should be grateful for very earliest possible reply to this telegram. At present Nuri seems to have gotleaders in a satisfactory frame  of mind, but any  delay in clinching agreementmay well result in embarking of extremists reinforced  by  mutual suspicion andanimosities of Arab leaders causing Nuri&apos;s mission to fail.     I understand that at a later stage Nuri proposes  to  associate in some  lessformal manner both Ibn Saud and Amir  Abdullah with his  proposed intervention.                                    (4)Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State.

Following is textreferred to in&apos;my telegram No. 637 :-    Begins:  The Government of  Iraq, actuated by  racial: ties which bind themwith the Arabs pf. Palestine on one hand and moved by ties of friendship andalliances which bind them with the British Government on the other, deems itincumbent upon them to mediate with a view to ending the present disturbances
in Palestine, and realising at the same time the importance of responsibilitiesAhusuc2ffc uP.on them through such mediation trusts (1) to induce the supremeArab Committee to take a resolution ending strike and all  present disorders-(2)  to use their good  offices with the British Government for the arant of alllegitimate demands of the Arabs of Palestine, whether such demands arise out ofthe present  disturbances or are connected  with the basis of general policv  inPalestine. Ends.                                                   r                                    (5)     Cypher Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to  the                             Secretary of State.                         Dated 24th August,  1936.                   (Received 3-41 P.M. 24th August, 1936.)    IMMEDIATE.    My telegram No. 637.    Nuri Pasha  told me this morning that at full meeting of the Arab  SupremeCommittee  held  yesterday afternoon all members agreed to  accept his  proposal of mediation for the termination of the strike and disorders unconditionally, and undertook within the next two or three days  to take all possible steps to ensureits acceptance by the local committees.    I am not in a  position  to guarantee the accuracy of this statement, but  Iwould urge that I be given  authority at the earliest possible moment to informNuri Pasha that His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome his mediation on  the lines proposed in my telegram No. 637.                                    (6)  Cypher Telegram from the Secretary of State to the High Commissioner for                                Palestine.                    (Sent 10-30 P.M. 25th August, 1936.)    IMMEDIATE.    Addressed to High Commissioner, No. 433.  Repeated to Bagdad, No.  164,Secret.    Your telegrams Nos. 637  and  643.  Proposal of Nuri differs materiallyfrom  what was  accepted by His Majesty&apos;s  Government  as regards proposedintervention by Ibn Saud in that all that His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed towas that Ibn Saud in association with other Arab rulers should use his influence with Arab  leaders to end. disorders, and  it was  made clear to him that untildisorders had ceased His Majesty&apos;s  Government was not prepared to make anypronouncement in regard to Arab demands.   Approval given by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to Ibn Saud&apos;s intervention with Palestine Arabs did not imply that,in the event of his inducing Arabs to cease disorder, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould entertain representations from  Ibn Saud  as to settlement of Palestinequestion.    Terms  of (2)  of Memorandum  quoted  in your  telegram No.  638 clearlycontemplate intervention of the Iraqi Government with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  in affairs of Palestine with a  view  to grant of Arab  demands  and prioracquiescence of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in despatch by  Nuri  of  such amemorandum to Arab  Supreme  Committee  would inevitably become publiclyknown and would be interpreted as implying that His Majesty&apos;s Government(1)  admitted that  Iraqi  Government could  properly intervene  in  affairs ofPalestine, and (2) had committed themselves in advance to meeting Arab demands,scope of which might be very wide.   This would clearly be most embarrassing to.His Majesty&apos;s Government.      [13711]                                                    B 2
    As I am sure you will  understand His  Majesty&apos;s  Government could not agree to formal mediation on part  of  Iraq Government, and for that reasonconsider form of proposed memorandum inappropriate.   You will recollect thatBagdad  telegram  No. 21 of 17th August  stated  that  Nuri  would  speak to palestine Arabs as an Arab and not as Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Itis important in view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that he should maintain hisrole  as distinguished  Arab on  friendly terms  with both parties and  not asrepresentative of foreign Government.    Apart from this consideration  terms of  memorandum take  no account of royal  Commission, whose recommendations  are  an essential preliminary to the examination of grievances  or of any change of policy.  Subject to your viewssuggest that you should explain  to Nuri that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot agree to formal mediation  of Iraq Government, and that in  any case it is feltthat terms of memorandum might give rise to  misunderstanding especially asit takes no account of Royal Commission.  It should be suggested to him if you agree that memorandum should take the form of a statement (1) that he is confident of  the firm intention of His  Majesty&apos;s Government to effect a just and lasting settlement of the Palestine question, (2) that an essential preliminaryis impartial examination by  the Royal Commission, and (3)  an appeal to theArab leaders to bring disorders to an end so  as to enable the commission to beginits work in  Palestine.                                     (7)    Cypher Telegram from  the  High  Commissioner for Palestine to the                             Secretary of State.                          IJated 26th August, 1936.                   (Received 7-35 P.M. 26th August, 1936.)    MOST Immediate.  No. 651, Secret.  Addressed to  Colonial Office, No. 651,-repeated to Bagdad, No. 984.    Your telegram No. 433.  It is clear that Nuri&apos;s proposal for mediation arosedirectly from Ibn Saud&apos;s  approach to  Arab rulers, including the King of Iraq,which was undertaken with His  Majesty&apos;s  Governments approval.    2.  It appears to me that  the intervention of Ibn Saud  would have placedHis Majesty&apos;s Government under the same moral obligation as the action proposedby Nuri on behalf of the Iraq Government.  Ibn Saud&apos;s intervention could only havebeen effective to the extent to which the Arabs believed in his capacity to influenceHis Majesty&apos;s  Government to  grant  such  of their demands as were  found tobe&quot; legitimate, and proposal to associate other Arab (corrupt  group)  with his;.intervention was doubtless directed to that  end.    3.  Nuri is at present in Alexandria visiting a sick son.   He  is probablyreturning to Palestine to-morrow, by which time he anticipated that the Councilof Ten, after consulting local Arab bodies, will have reached a final decision.    4.  Such is the Arab mentality that it would in the (?) occasion be impossiblefor Nuri Pasha, any more than it would have been for Ibn Saud, to intervene inhis private  and  not in his official capacity.  Arabs are incapable of  under-standing such  a refinement.  If he  had in practice  intervened  as a privateindividual, and  if this  could have been understood by  the Arabs of Palestine,his intervention would be  wholly effective, since it  is only to the extent to whichhe can (?) promise good offices of his Government that he could exert any influence over Arab opinion.  Clearly as a private individual any  representations he madeto His Majesty&apos;s Government would be unavailing.  It is only as Foreign minister that he could hope to give weight to his representations.    5.  I am hopeful  that. I  can introduce into the  proposed memorandummention of Royal- Commission (corrupt group) qualifying  &apos;&apos; all legitimate demandsconnected with the basis of general policy in Palestine.&quot;   Nuri Pasha has made it clear that he does  not know nor wish to know what His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare prepared to concede now as regards clemency and suspension of immigration,
and  that until the Royal Commission reports he cannot know (? what) Arabdemands that body will  (? regard) as  legitimate and which His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment may reasonably be expected to (j accept).     6.  I am also hopeful that my memorandum can be amended to make it clearthat only informal use of Iraq Government good offices is contemplated.     7.  It is the firm intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to effect  a just and lasting  settlement  of  Palestine  questions;  therefore I  see  little danger  in accepting informal mediation of the Iraq Government.     If, on the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government, by rejecting  present offer of informal  mediation, show themselves reluctant to allow Iraq Government touse their good offices with the British Government for grant of legitimate demandsof Arabs, then I fear every  Arab will be firmly convinced that what  detractorsof His Majesty&apos;s  Government say is true, and that Royal Commission is merelycamouflage, and that there is no intention to do anything for Arabs.     8.  The present development is by far the most hopeful since the disturbancesbegan.  I see in it our (corrupt group)  real chance of securing peace  withoutprecedent (corrupt group) by His Majesty&apos;s  Government..  Disorder has alreadymarkedly diminished, and the whole country  is in a state of sanguine expectation of an early solution.  If these hopes were now to be completely dashed  by refusal of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  to allow informal mediation of the Iraq  Govern-ment, the disappointment and  the suspicion  engendered would be such as in all probability to render impossible solution  by  agreement  on the lines  indicated onpage 6 of my secret despatch of the 22nd August. The consequences would be very grave indeed, almost certainly involving a great increase of violence and requiringan immediate and very substantial increase of the garrison.     9.  To summarise; if Nuri cannot deal with the Arab leaders as a repre-sentative of the Iraq Government and if that Government cannot later makeinformal representation  to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to  further any  recom-mendations of the Royal Commission which may be made in favour of the Arabs,then I can see no hope of any alternative to that outlined  by me in  my  secretdespatch of the 22nd August, namely, adoption of most drastic means to enddisorder which will become far more violent than now, a large increase  of presentgarrison and an end to all hope of securing  a settlement, that will  not leave anembittered, sullen, and in their hearts, rebellious Arab population ready to rebelin any future year.     10.  I hope that your reply to this will not be such as to compel me to adopt this  alternative.                                    (8)    Cypher Telegram from the Secretary of State to the High Commissioner                               for Palestine.                     (Sent 7-45 P,M. 27th August, 1936.)    MOST  IMMEDIATE.  No. 437.    Addressed to High Commissioner, No. 437. Repeated to Bagdad, No. 165.    Private and Personal.    Your telegram No. 651.  I am prepared to accept your  advice that action byNuri  in  purely personal capacity  would be ineffectual.  But I  adhere to  view expressed in my telegram No. 433 that formal  mediation  by foreign Governmentis inadmissible in itself.  To accept it in the case of the Iraqi Government wouldalso involve us in difficulties with Ibn Saud and other rulers who have offeredtheir  good offices.  Nevertheless, I am so impressed by your arguments against allowing present chance of peace to slip that,  in spite of these.considerations, Iam prepared to agree to some action by Nuri on general lines proposed.   It must,however, be clearly understood that mediation  can only relate to such recommen-dations as m&amp;y be made by Royal Commission, whose conclusions  and  their consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot be prejudged.  I request thatyou will explain to Nuri that for  above reasons terms of memorandum in  your
G telegram No. 638 are unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government.  If, however,. he is willing to adopt modified draft of memorandum indicated in my immediately. following telegram, you are authorised to tell him that I would welcome mediation strictly limited within its framework.

NO. 438.     Addressed to High Commissioner, No. 438.  Repeated to Bagdad, No. 166.Secret.     Following is text referred to in my telegram No. 437 :       Begins :  The Government of Iraq, actuated by racial ties which bind themwith the Arabs  of Palestine on one hand and  moved by ties of friendship andalliance which bind  them with Great Britain  on the other, deem it incumbenton them to offer informal mediation with a view to ending the present disturbances in Palestine, and realising at the same time the importance of responsibilities thuscast upon them through such informal mediation trust (1) to induce the SupremeArab Committee to  take  a  resolution ending strike and all  present disorders;(2) to use their good offices with the British Government in regard to such measures as the Royal Commission may recommend for  meeting the legitimate  demandsof the Arabs of Palestine, arising  out of the  underlying causes  of the  recent disturbances.
