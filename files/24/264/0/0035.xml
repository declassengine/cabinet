Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1936.Copy No.CP. 260  (36).CABINET.PALESTINE SITUATION:  QUESTION OF TEMPORARY SUSPENSION                           OF IMMIGRATION.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I CIRCULATE herewith,  for the information of my colleagues, the text ofa secret despatch which has just reached me from Sir Arthur Wauchope, in whichhe gives me his considered views on the question whether it will be necessary or desirable to impose some temporary suspension of immigration, and,  if so, what form the suspension should take and what reasons could be publicly given for suchaction.    2.  The  High Commissioners view, as  recorded  in paragraph  13 of  thedespatch, is that, while temporary suspension of immigration might  possibly bejustified for political reasons, he is satisfied that it could not be defended, certainly not publicly, on those grounds, and that it is not at present justifiable on economic grounds.    3   On the important  questions  of  policy  involved,  I  hope  to issue amemorandum  in  due course.   Meanwhile,  I  have  telegraphed  to  Sir arthur wauchope  that I assume he will not take  a decision as to granting a LabourSchedule for October to March without prior reference to me.                                               (Initialled)      W. O. G.    Colonial  Office, Downing Street,            October  10, 1936.APPENDIX.      Secret Despatch from the High Commissioner from Palestine, dated           October 1,  1936, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Secret.)(Reference No. CF/521/36.)Sir,                                                       October 1, 1936.    I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Secret despatch of the15th September, 1936, in. which you ask me for my considered views as to whetherit is necessary and desirable to impose some temporary suspension of immigration,and, if so, what form the suspension should now take and what reasons can  begiven publicly for such action.    2.   You suggest that I should deal separately with :     (a)  The arguments  in favour of a temporary suspension to be brought into           force after the restoration of order and continued until decisions had           been taken on the report of the Royal  Commission; and      [13921]                                                      BSECRET.
     (b) the question whether, and if so to what extent, it may be necessary  for           military reasons to suspend  immigration  as one of  the measures           necessary for the restoration of order.     3.  The  policy  of Government  in   regulating Jewish  immigration into Palestine has been and is that laid down in the White Paper of 1930 as interpreted by the Prime Ministers letter to Dr. Weizmann in February 1931; in brief, it is that the immigration shall be regulated according to the economic capacity of  the country to absorb the immigrants who are admitted to the country.  This policy,i until further instruction, I am bound, by the directions of the Secretary of State given at the time, to fulfil.     The legislative expression of this policy is the Immigration Ordinance, 1933, and under this Ordinance  the volume of immigration since 1932 has consisted for the most part of  immigrants  in  Category  A  (i)  (Capitalists  with   at least  1,000), immigrants in Category C  (Labour  Schedule) and immigrants in Category  D (Dependants).     4.  The  High  Commissioner, as you know, has  direct  responsibility  for deciding the size of the Labour Schedule and can, therefore, adjust the size of the Schedule to the needs of the country taking a long view as to future prospects; he has no control as regards the volume  of immigrants in Category A  (i)  or in Category  D since  admission to Palestine in  these  categories depends on  the statutory  qualifications and lack of statutory disqualifications of the  individual immigrants.     5.  As regards  Category C  (Labour Schedule),  I am  informed  by  the Commissioner for Migration and Statistics that, while he has  not yet completed his survey  of the  economic prospects  for the  next  six  months, he  is already satisfied that the Jewish Agency could justifiably ask for  a schedule of consider- able numbers, and  that on economic grounds alone he  will recommend a labour schedule.   If  the final reports on the matter convince me that this view of  the situation is correct, and I am fairly confident  that it is correct, it is clear that I  shall not,  for  economic  reasons, recommend a suspension of  immigration  in Category C.  As I see the matter at present, a  suspension of labour immigration might have some slight harmful effect on agricultural development, although such effect could not  be  serious.  As soon as order  is restored industry will wish to expand its enterprise; and suspension of immigration would tend  to check that: expansion.     6.   It is difficult to judge the economic effects of the suspension of immigra-tion in Category A (i) ( 1,000) as, judging from Bank  deposits, there is no lackof capital in the country,  and  it can reasonably be assumed that, for the  mostpart, capital is imported in advance of the capitalist immigrant.  But suspension of immigration in Category A (i) may stop or divert elsewhere streams of wealthwhich may not begin to flow again for a  long time.   On the whole I think thatthe economic effects of suspension might be greater than those which might result from the continuance of immigration on its present scale.     7.   Immigration in Category  D (Dependants) has, as you are aware, been a cause of anxiety  for the past two years. &apos; There is evidence available that youngwomen,  who entered the country as dependants, and who subsequently  deriveda  livelihood from unskilled occupations,  are now finding it difficult  to obtainemployment.     On the other hand, the complete suspension of the immigration of dependantshas never been contemplated; and I think that the best course at present is, as  inthe case of capitalist immigrants, to watch developments so that suspension  of dependent immigration may be enforced if  the situation changes for the worse to a degree warranting  that course,  except perhaps for  aged parents or physicallydisabled relatives.    In the meantime, the narrower interpretation of the definition of dependantswhich your predecessor approved, but which has not yet been given statutory effect,is being applied with good effect by the Commissioner for Migration and Statisticsas an administrative rule, without any demur by the Jewish  Agency.    8.   It  is scarcely necessary to mention the remaining categories  of immi-grants, since most of them are closed for  economic reasons, and, where they are
 not closed,  the immigrants are admitted on financial  guarantees of persons  or institutions in Palestine competent to give those guarantees.   It follows that, again on economic grounds alone, I am unable to sustain an argument that immi- gration in these categories should be suspended.     9.   In summary, taking the policy of immigration as it stands and as I have- been directed to follow it on,the basis of the economic capacity: of the country to absorb  new  immigrants, my  considered view is that  no justification exists  at present for suspending immigration temporarily.     I do not exclude the possibility that a marked deterioration  of economic life - may  take  place  later  in  any of  several  eventualities for example,  military operations, a  &quot;run&quot; on banks and that this deterioration may justify the sus- pension of immigration on economic grounds.  As I have said, I shall cause the situation to be watched particularly in regard to Categories A (i)  and D, so that I may  be in a position to make any necessary recommendations to you with the necessary promptitude.     10.  I now turn to discuss political considerations.     In paragraph 4 of your despatch you point out that the principle of economic absorptive capacity will be one of the most important matters under review by the Royal Commission and that it could be argued that the status quo should, so far as possible, be preserved from the time when the Commission starts its delibera- tions until the time that His Majesty&apos;s Government reach their decisions upon its report.     I assume that the meaning of the paragraph is that the Arab  and Jewish populations should be maintained for that interval as they are to-day, save in  so far  as  natural  increase may change their relative proportions, and that the principle of economic absorptive capacity which will, without doubt, be considered by  the Royal Commission, should not be permitted to operate to disturb those proportions in case the Royal Commission may recommend any variation of the principle.     It has been  suggested  to me that                                      &apos;      (i) The principle of  economic absorptive capacity is challenged  by the           present Arab uprising and is open to doubt when applied to a country           in which there is already a settled population.      (ii) The legislation expressing the  policy  of  economic  absorptive capacity           is  defective both in itself and  in its enforcement, as has since been           argued in a series of my despatches since 1934.     (iii) So long as the principle of economic absorptive capacity is maintained,.           Arabs fear that a  Jewish majority in Palestine may come about in a           measurable future.      (iv) It is tolerably certain that under the existing immigration policy and           the present legislative expression of that policy there will be a  Jewish           majority in Palestine in a measurable  future.      (v) There is, therefore, ground in justice to His Majesty&apos;s  Government, to           the Jews and to the Arabs to  suspend immigration until these doubts           are resolved by the impartial advice of the Royal Commission.     Such an argument, I agree, points to the desirability of reviewing the whole question of immigration, as is contemplated in  the appointment and terms of reference of the Royal Commission:  it definitely does not by itself  establish  a case for the suspension of immigration until the doubts are  resolved.     In any event it would be difficult, I apprehend, for His Majesty&apos;s Government publicly  to avow  that they had doubts of  their own principle of policy  and of the legislative expression of that policy; so  that, even if the argument has  weight on  its own merits,  it  appears to be excluded by the  terms  of paragraph  9  ofyour  despatch.     11.   In paragraph 5 of  your despatch you raise the question whether,  in view  of the expectations which appear to be entertained in some Arab quarters that,  at any rate some  time after order has been restored, immigration will  be suspended, an adverse decision on this point might not lead to  further serious difficulties with the Arabs and even possibly the boycott of the Commission.     Such expectations are, I  believe,  widely entertained  in  Arab quarters; but they are not based  on any pledges  or  promises given by the  Secretary of State      [13921]                                                    B 2
or by the High Commissioner; and the suspension of immigration could not bejustified merely because Arabs entertained unwarranted hopes, or ,because they regarded the Secretary of State&apos;s answer in the House of Commons to.the effectthat the matter could  be  considered  on  its merits as a  promise  to  imposesuspension.     It is possibly true that the Royal Commission might have a better opportunityfor appraising the Arab views if immigration were/suspended, since suspensionwould tend  to secure good order in the country for the time being, and thus tocreate that atmosphere of calm in which alone the deliberations of the commission could be pursued to the desired end and all necessary evidence  collected.   On theother hand,  I should hesitate to exclude the possibility that, if  immigration were temporarily suspended, the Jews might boycott the  Commission or the  unrulyelements among them go so far as  to resort to violent methods of protestation.I remain, however, of the opinion, which I understand you to hold, that nothing should be done which might have even the appearance of a concession to Arabviolence.  It is clear  that suspension  of immigration, whether  on  political or oneconomic grounds, would be represented by Arabs as a measure of  success  for thepolicy  of resistance  to  Government, and,  since this resistance  has  now  been continued for  nearly six  months,  despite the declarations  of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the  approaching arrival of the Royal Commission, despite thecivil and military  action  taken and the  various efforts of  mediation,  I am convinced that to encourage such a belief in the Arab population as a whole orallow its fulfilment would be most dangerous.  The Arab contempt for authority,persisting since the outbreak of disturbance, is now so hardened that it could notbut gain additional strength from any act of Government that had the appearance of yielding  to  the violence  which is  one  of its manifestations.   Equally,  it isimportant to  prevent the  emergence  of  a general tendency  towards criminalactivity which continued disorders are likely to awaken among certain classes ofthe population.   Such a tendency is  subversive of all  government whatever  itsform or substance,  and it must be  eradicated.  The temporary  suspension of jewish  immigration at  this juncture, following the developments and  tendencieswhich I have described, would expose Government to  the risk of armed rebellionrecurring as a method of achieving political aims and to the no less grave  (andmore constant) risk of wide-spread criminality.     12.  I have at earlier stages in the present disorders held the view that atemporary suspension of immigration  should be  brought into force after therestoration of order,  and, in particular, I  expressed myself as recognising thenecessity for such a course as a condition of the mediation offered by General NuriSaid Pasha, Foreign Minister of Iraq.     The situation is  now in general altogether different, and in regard to themediation of General Nuri Said the  negotiations are at  an end and  conditions.are changed.     The reasons for which I supported the suggestion of a temporary suspension of immigration at that time were three.     First, to further the mediation of General Nuri Said;  secondly, to secureconditions in Palestine which would enable the Royal Commission to carry out itstask in the right atmosphere; thirdly, on the ground that the method of regulatingimmigration into Palestine was  one  of  the matters  into  which  the  RoyalCommission would have to enquire.     The second and third  reasons were also mentioned in your Secret despatchunder reply.     In  my appreciation none of these reasons  is any longer  valid.   The  first,because conditions  are changed and  the  mediation of  General  Nuri Said isterminated; the second, because it is to the forces at the disposal of the GeneralOfficer Commanding  that the task of establishing  conditions within  which theRoyal  Commission  may properly pursue  its  deliberations should be entrusted;and the third because, the first two reasons having been discarded, it does not seemto  me  to  be  in  itself strong enough  to  justify  temporary  suspension  of immigration.     13.  In conclusion, I repeat that, while temporary suspension of immigrationmight possibly be justified for political reasons, I am satisfied that  it could not be defended, certainly not publicly, on those grounds, and that it certainly is not at
present justifiable  on economic  grounds,  &quot; I shall, however,  continue  to keepimmigration in all categories under strict surveillance and shall not fail to reportto you should  there be any change  in the situation, political or economic, whichwould, in my view, warrant my recommending that it be suspended either whollyor in certain categories.     14.  I enclose short notes by the Commissioner for Migration and Statisticson paragraph 7 (5)  of  your despatch and on the  point raised in paragraph 8concerning the possible  congestion in local areas by reason of the immigration of refugees.   I would add that  hostels  are maintained by the Jewish Agency atHaifa in which newly-arrived immigrants may be kept for periods of time priorto their distribution to various destinations in the country  should such detentionbe necessitated on account of any  difficulty or delay in the use of road or  rail communications.    15.  I have had a talk with Lieutenant-General Dill on the possibilities ofhis considering a suspension of immigration necessary on purely military grounds(see (b) in paragraph 2 of  this despatch), and I enclose a copy of the letter whichhe sent me to-day  at my  request,  summarising his views on this question atpresent.                                          I have, &amp;c.                                 (Signed)       A. G. WAUCHOPE,                                         High Commissioner for Palestine.                                 APPENDIX I.     Note on Paragraph 7 (5) of the Secretary of State&apos;s Secret Despatch of                             September 15, 1936.              By the Commissioner for Migration and Statistics.     THE  estimate should not be judged solely in the light of the experience of 1935     2.  Until the beginning of 1936 certificates in Categories A (i) and D (and indeed some other categories) were valid for one year.  The validity was much curtailed at the beginning of 1936.  A significant number of certificates issued are not utilised;  these certificates are gained as a kind of &apos;&apos; insurance &apos;&apos;  against certain contingencies in  country of present  abode.     3.  I anticipated that rumours of suspension of immigration would lead to the use of certificates issued between September and December 1935, which normally would not have been utilised.  I anticipated that Jewish social and political pressure would compel many holders of such certificates to use them even though the holders themselves might be reluctant to use them of their own motion.     4.  I  also  anticipated  that   the  new  &quot; self-transfer&quot; arrangements  in Germany, under which  German Jews can obtain their  capital in Palestine more speedily than of late, would  increase relatively the number  of  German Jewish capitalist immigrants.     I also anticipated that the German Government would intensify anti-Jewish activities after the Olympic Games in Berlin so that those who held certificates, but  might be reluctant to  use them while  Palestine was  in disorder, would nevertheless enter  Palestine.     5.  There  must be  an  imponderable in Jewish immigration,  namely,  the real  intention of the holder of a certificate  at any  future time.  The rumour of suspension of immigration may often convert a doubtful intention to immigrate into  an effective act of immigration.     6.  Experience  in  September this year to  some  extent  justifies  my anticipation  since  a considerable number of dependants have arrived in virtue of authorities granted a year ago, of many of whom it may be  said that they would not have come at present if they had not been encouraged by the propulsivetones of Zionism.
APPENDIX IT.Note on Possible Congestion due to Immigration of Refugees.  (Paragraph 8 of        the Secretary of State&apos;s Secret Despatch of September 15, 1936.)             By the Commissioner for Migration and Statistics.   &apos;      &apos;    1.  CONGESTION is chronic in Tel Aviv and certain villages and suburbs.   . 2.  Refugees are being gradually drafted to rural settlements.    3.  The congestion is  not so far of such degree as to  justify of itself the suspension of further immigration.  Tent-life in some Jewish villages  is now a regular form of accommodation for newcomers until  they are allotted permanentquarters.                               APPENDIX III.                                       Headquarters, British Forces,(Secret.)                                    Palestine and Transjordan,Your Excellency,                                Jerusalem,  October 1, 1936.    I GIVE below  answers to the questions  which you asked me to consideryesterday.                                 1.  By Sea.(a) Immigrants.    I cannot foresee any military need to stop  immigrants entering Palestine by sea in the near  future even if martial law should be imposed.   It  is, however,impossible to say now that conditions might not arise requiring control of numbersor even a temporary suspension.  It should, however, be possible  to give adequatenotice of any change.(b) Travellers.    Under Martial Law it will be necessary to restrict entry of travellers in order not to divert forces from their duties  to afford them protection.                                2. By Land.(a) Immigrants.    The  same  general policy applies  to immigrants by  land as  applies  toimmigrants by sea.   It may become necessary to exercise rigorous control or stopentry by land routes from  the  North and East in order to deal with  armedinvaders.(b) Travellers.    The same general policy will apply as in 1 (b).                                 3.  Trade.    Even should martial law become necessary every effort will be made not onlynot to interfere  with trade, but to encourage a resumption of the normal tradeactivities of the country.   .                               I have &amp;c.                         (Signed)       J. G.  DILL, Lieutenant-General,                                           General Officer Commanding,                                               British Forces in Palestine.    His Excellency  the High Commissioner        of the Government of Palestine,                  Jerusalem.   .
