Memorandum by the Home Secretary.      1.        I  think it is desirable to call the attention  of      the Cabinet  to the arrangements which are being made - as a      protest against the Unemployment Regulations -  for contingents      of unemployed persons to march on London, the marchers being      due to arrive on the 8th November .      2.        The idea of the proposed national-march on London      appears to have been first discussed at a meeting of the      National Administrative Council of the National Unemployed      Workers1 Movement held in the middle of July, 1936.   At  that      time it was  hoped by the Communist Party and by the National      Unemployed Workers&apos;  Movement to get the official Trade Union      and Labour movement to take responsibility for  calling the      march, and on the 21st July the Communist Party of Great      Britain sent an official circular to all party branches  stating      that the organisation of a mass march on London was of the      utmost importance and that every effort must be made to  get      the march organised under the auspices of the Labour Party and      the Trades Union Congress .   Although the Trades Union Congress      and the Labour Party have now officially refused to lend any      approval to  the march,  the National Unemployed Workers&apos;      Movement and the Communist Party still hope that it may be      possible to  represent the march as the outcome of spontaneous      disapproval  of the Unemployment Regulations, and every effort      is being made to arrange that local Trades Councils and united      front bodies shall sponsor the formation of contingents and
 themselves arrange the recruitment of marchers and plans for their journey to London.   Some success has been achieved in the efforts being made to prevent the proposed march from being labelled as a project of the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Movement or the Communist Party, and on the 29th August last. at a conference in Cardiff of 595 delegates representing various Trades and Labour Councils and Divisional Labour Parties, a unanimous decision was reached to sponsor an unemployed march on London.   That the conference as a whole was unaware that the proposal for the march emanated from the National unemployed workers&apos; Movement is clear from a report made immediately after the meeting hy Idris Cox, South Wales organiser of the CommunistParty,  to the headquarters of the Communist Party,  in which he requested that circulars issued by the National unemployed workers&apos; Movement should not give the impression that theMovement was organising the march.   A further indication of the desire of the organisers to avoid having a Communist labelattached to the march is the fact that the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; has so far refrained from publishing any account of the meeting of theNational Administrative Council of the National unemployed workers&apos; Movement which was held in London on the 29th August.3 .        Plans for the marnh are in a fairly advanced state of preparation.   The principal assembly points and dates of starting and (where known)  the strength of the several contingents are as follows:-SCOTLAND:   West,  400,  Glasgow,  5th October.           East,  300,  Edinburgh,  5th October.NORTHUMBERLAND AND DURHAM:   300,  Newcastle-on-Tyne ,  11th October.LANCASHIRE:   Manchester,  20th October.YORKSHIRE,  NOTTS.  AND  DERBY:   Sheffield,  25th  October.
                                                          MlSOUTH WALES:  Cardiff, 25th October.WOMEN&apos;S CONTINGENT:  Coventry.          Local Reception Committees  are in process of being set up in the different districts for the purpose of arrangingaccommodation for the marchers in London, and a LondonReception Committee is being formed to co-ordinate theactivities of the local Reception Committees in London.   Thereis reason to believe that the organisers are making their   - .arrangements on the assumption that the London County Council,owing to its Labour majority, will not place any difficultiesin.the way of providing accommodation for the marchers while they are in London.4.        The question whether any steps could be taken toprevent contingents of unemployed from marching on London was fully considered by a Cabinet Sub-Committee in 1932 after thehunger marhh of that year which gave  rise to seriousdisturbances in London.   That Committee considered various proposals for strengthening the law so as to enable theauthorities to deal with the problem  presented by processionsand concentrations of marchers on London, but,  on the advice ofthe then Attorney General,  recommended that, before resorting to new legislation, further trial should be given to theprocedure by which a Court of Summary Jurisdiction may uponcomplaint order any person to enter into recognisances and findsureties to keep the peace or be of good behaviour,  but that,if this experiment proved unsuccessful,  the question of strengthening the existing lav/ should be again considered.   TheCabinet at their meeting on the 21st  December,  1932,  (cabinet conclusions 68(32) 10) approved the recommendation of theCabinet Sub-Committee.   In pursuance of this Cabinet decision,
 the  question was  considered -towards the  end of 1933 whether the organisers of the hunger march on London which took place in 1934  could be brought before the Court to give sureties, but on this  occasion the organisers and leaders of the march made it their policy to preach discipline and order to their followers, and nothing occurred which would have enabled this procedure to be followed.   In 1934 as a result of the difficulties caused i London by Fascist activities, the whole  question of the preservation of public order in conne ction.with, meetings and processions was brought before the Cabinet by the then Home Secretary in a memorandum - C .P. 189 (34).   Amongst the questions raised in this memorandum was  the question whether th time  was ripe for seeking powers to prevent demonstrators from concentrating in London in such a manner as might be likely to lead  to serious disorder or the derangement of the public assistance administration.   The Cabinet at their meeting on the 18th July,  1934, (Cabinet Conclusions 29(34) 2) decided tha the Home Secretary should meet the Leaders of the Opposition an discuss with them the several proposals  in his memorandum. Piscussions followed with the Leaders of the Opposition but nothing came of these conversations and  the matter has since been  held in abeyance. 5 .        There are no  provisions in the existing law by which bands of demonstrators  can be prevented  from marching to London or elsewhere,  so long as they are orderly and well/behaved. Police action can only be taken when an  offence is committed or a breach of the peace may be reasonably apprehended.   Nothing therefore can be done to prevent  the proposed march taking place, and the  only course open is to take every precaution to minimise the risk of disorder both on the routes of the contingents and in London.   With this  object in view the Home
                                                            1                                                            X -JtrfJ)                          -5-Office is in close touch with the Chief Officers of Police in theprovinces and. with the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.Special arrangements will he made with a view to the preservation of order in and near the Houses of Parliament, and I propose to consult the authorities of the House of Commons as to the methodsof dealing with any demands that may he made by the marchers forthe reception of deputations at the House.6.        As Parliament will not reassemble before the 29thOctober, it will not be possible on this occasion to arrange fora Question in the House of Commons which would give an opportunityto inform the public of the identity and motives of the organisersand to discourage persons from furnishing assistance to themarchers.   The answer given to a Parliamentary Question by my predecessor on the 21st December, 1933, had-the effect of makingthe organisers of the hunger march in 1934 much more circumspectand helped to alienate public sympathy from the marchers (seeAppendix I).   I have consulted the Minister of Health and theMinister of Labour, and think that the best course would be toarrange, probably through the National Publicity Bureau, forselected journalists to be interviewed and given material forexposing the origin, motive and uselessness of the march.   the sort of line to be taken is set out in Appendix II.7.        Two other demonstration marches have been organised,both of which are to reach London on 31st October - that is to say a week before the date on which the hunger-marchers will arrive.One is a march of unemployed men from Jarrow in which some 200men are taking part.   This march, organised by the Jarrow Council,is not a Communist movement and it- is represented as non-political.The object is to draw the attention of the Government to theserious unemployment situation in Jarrow.   The other is a march
      of blind persons organised by the  National League of the  Blind      in which it is expected that about 250 blind persons accompanied      by some 50 attendants will take part.    The object is to  secure      amendments of the Blind Persons Act.    While these two marches,  .      in the intention of their promoters,  have no connection with      the hunger march, there is an obvious  possibility that when they      reach London they may be drawn into the same current.  The      Communists will certainly do their best to make  use of them.      8.        I have enquired whether  persons taking part in  the      marches will,  during their absence from home,  continue to receive      unemployment benefit or unemployment  allowances  and what  the      position of such persons will be in relation to  Poor Law  relief.      I  am informed by the Minister of Labour that while the decision      upon any claim to unemployment benefit must be given by the      Statutory Authorities (the Insurance  Officers, Courts of      Referees and the Umpire)  there is  no  reason to apprehend  that      the decisions  will be other than those given on  the occasion of      previous marches and accordingly unemployment benefit will  not      be payable.    The Unemployment Assistance Board  state that      persons in receipt of unemployment assistance cannot be regarded      as available for work while engaged on the march and in the      circumstances  the Board will be precluded from accepting      responsibility for the maintenance of  a marcher  or his dependants.      The Minister of Health informs me  that the marchers,  if unable  to      obtain lodging and food will,  as casual wayfarers,  be entitled      to relief from Public Assistance Authorities.    Public Assistance      Authorities  are,  therefore,  bound,  on  application,  to provide      accommodation  for such men as  have  not the means  or are otherwise      unable to obtain a lodging insofar as  room can be  found in      (a)  casual wards;   (b)  spare room  in their institutions;   andi
12th October,  1956 (c) any temporary accommodation which can readily he secured.Where marchers are admitted to casual wards the ordinaryregulations as to search,  bathing and dietary are applicable.These regulations include a provision for two nights compulsorydetention, &quot;but it is probable that most Authorities will waivethis requirement.9.        We shall no doubt be asked in due course to receivethe hunger marchers in deputation and we should be clear aboutthe line we are to take.   It is the settled practice of recentMinistries, including that of the last Labour Government,  thatdeputations should not be received by Ministers in such circumstances, and I have no doubt that we should take the sameline as this on this occasion.   As on previous occasions,Ministers would of course be prepared, if desired, to receiveMembers of Parliament accompanied by a few representatives ofthe marchers.   It will not be possible to distinguish in thisrespect between the hunger marchers and the Jarrow and Blindmarchers and the same rules should therefore apply to them.

APPENDIX  I .  PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES21st   December,   1933-                     Marches.    Commander MARSDEN  asked the Secretary of State for the HemeDepartment whether, in view cf the steps being taken to organisea hunger march on London early in the new year, he willstate what information he has either as to the names of the organisers of the march or the arrangements made for it?    The SECRETARY OP STATE for the HOME DEPARTMENT (Sir JohnGilmcur)     I am aware that in connection with a congressdescribing itself as the &quot;National United Prent Congress&quot;to be held in London in February next,  a march to-London bycontingents from different parts of the country is being organised.  It is clear from published  statements of theCommunist party that they are the prime instigators of the plans for this march, that it will be under their control andsubordinated to their purposes, and that the intention is torepresent the march as a &quot;mass struggle of the unemployed&quot;.I am sure that there will be general agreement that thesemarches are not in the real interests of the &quot;unemployed,and any persons undertaking to furnish means which enablesuch concentrations to take place incur very grave responsibility.    Crmmander MARSDEN:  Is it not a fact that these marches havenever d*ne any good, and that they merely bring more distressand trouble to a great number of those  who take part in them?    Sir J. Gilmour.  Yes, Sir, and on that point I hopethat Hen. Members on all sides of the House will agree.    Mr. T . WILLIAMS::  What attitude is  the right hen. Gentlemangoing to take tc the greatest of all the organisers ofhunger marches, namely, the Minister of Agriculture?
                     APPENDIX  II.         MARCH OP THE UNEMPLOYED ON LONDON.           *      Plans are being made- for a march, en London of contingentsof the unempleyed from certain districts in England, Wales and scotland? and it is proposed that the marchers should arrive inLondon on the 8th November .      The Communist Party and the National unemployed workers&apos; Movement are the prime instigators of the plans for this march and it will be under the control of these bodies and subordinated, to their purposes.      Marches of this kind can do no sort of good tothe causes for which they are supposed te be undertaken.In a country like ours, governed by a parliamentary&apos;system,where every adult has a vote and every area has its representative in the House of Commons to put forward grievances and discussremedies, processions to London cannot claim to have any constitutional influence on the policy of the Government.  It isthe settled practice that Ministers of the Crown should refuse toreceive deputations from such demonstrations.   But for the precautions taken by the P*li*a, marches of this kind would be liable to lead to disorders, and the need for taking specialprecautionary measures throws a great strain wi both theProvincial and Metropolitan Poli*e Forces, whose duty it is toprevent breaches of the peace.      The marches involve much hardship to many of thosetaking part in them and are only a method of exploiting the unfortunate without bringing to them any real advantage.  Itis hoped that the general public throughout the country will discourage and discountenance any such proceedings in every possible way.
