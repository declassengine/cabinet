Our present Report  is  concerned with certain matters  falling within the second part  of our Terms of Reference,  namelys           &quot;The  constitutional and. other&quot; questions            arising  in connection with the association            of the Dominions  in the Coronation ceremony&quot;,            (Cabinet  4.0 (36)  Conclusion  1). 2.    The proposals  for which Cabinet authority is now requested arise out  of the  actual ceremony in  Westminster Abbey.   While it  is clearly desirable that every opportunity should be taken of  associating  representatives of the Dominions with the ceremony,  it is by  no means  easy in  practice  to suggest forms which their participation can take,  if  it  Is  to be  harmonised, as  we think it must be,  with the- traditional  customs and observances of  an English Coronation,   In the  view of the Archbishop of Canterbury &quot;it  is  difficult to  discover any words which could express the  loyalty  of the  several  Dominions&apos;&quot; and would be suitable for incorporation  in  the Abbey  service, 3c    Our recommendations  accordingly deal with  certain parts of the ceremonies.    Taking  first the opening procession, whichwill  conduct His Majesty  from  the west  door of  the Abbey to the choir (a procession in  reverse order of seniority), we recommend that  the Dominion prime Ministers who are present should beplaced in the -procession  immediately after the Lord President ofthe Council and immediately before the prime Minister of the3 b JL-R jl3. -,;,P, 253 (36).
211United Kingdom.  This will he-in accordance with the directions regarding precedence on ceremonial occasions inthis country which His late Majesty approved in 1925(although no formal announcement -was made).   We considerthat it will Toe desirable to follow precedent as closely aspossible with regard to the Standards to he borne in thisprocession;  as regards the Standards of the Dominions itshoula be left to the Dominion Governments themselves todecide by whom they shall be carried.4.     Our next proposal is for the representative partici-pation of the Dominions, preferably in the persons of theirPrime Ministers, in the &quot;Recognition&quot;, a ceremony which takes place during the earlier part of the Coronation service.   The/&quot;Recognition&quot; consists, in accordance with precedent,in the Archbishop of Canterbury presenting HisMajesty to the people,  and asking whetherthey are willing to do their homage and. service, to  which thepeople answer &quot;by loud and repeated acclamations&quot;, with thewords &quot;God save King Edward&quot;.   Our proposal is that  each                             shall have of the Prime Ministers present/the opportunity of answeringseparately on behalf of his country &quot;God save King Edward&quot;.Thus the Prime Minister of the United Hingdom would answer the first time,the Prime Minister of Canada the second time,and so forth.   After the Dominion Prime Ministers a Memberof the Government of India should be given the opportunityof answering,   India is not a Dominion, but its size and importance, its special position in the British Empire, andthe fact of its well-established separate mention in theRoyal Title give it a. claim to take part.   The privilegewill have no new constitutional significance but will comevery appropriately in the year of the inauguration of theIndian Reforms.  Finally would come the traditional answer                     -2-
Summary of Recommendations.5.   The recommendations of  our present Report may be summarisedas followsj-     (i) In the procession at the beginning of the         Coronation service,  from the west  door of         Westminster Abbey to the choir, the Dominion         Prime Ministers should be placed immediately         after the Lord President of the Council and         immediately before  the Prime Minister of the         Uni t e d Kingdom.    (ii) Precedent should be  followed as closely as         possible with regard to the Standards to be         carried in this procession?  as regards the         Standards of the Dominions it should be left         to the Dominion Governments themselves to         decide by whom they  should be carried.   (iii) It will be a desirable innovation  in the         &quot;Recognition&quot;  part  of the Coronation         service if (before  the acclamations of the         people) it can be arranged for the  prime         Ministers of the United Kingdom and the         Dominions,  and a Member of the Government         of India,  to give separate answers,  each         speaking as the representative of his         country.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeJ. RAMSAY MACDOEALDChairman.2, Whitehall Gardens,  3.V.I.    October 23rd,  1926.     We realise that it will almost certainly not be possibleto persuade all of the Dominions to take part in this ceremony,but we desire to recommend the proposal to the Cabinet.   the replies by the Prime Ministers would it is hoped be audibleduring the broadcasting of the service, and this should be much.appreciated by listeners in the respective parts of the Empireoverseas.
