&quot;T.(.3$).-COPY NO.CABINET.TRAMP SHIPPING SUBSIDY.Memorandum by the President of the          Board of Trade.   (l) The subsidy to the Tramp  Shipping industry, which was provided by  the British Shipping (Assistance) Act, 1935, and continued for the year 1936 in the British  Shipping (Con-tinuance of  Subsidy) Act, 1936,  in accordance with decisions reached on proposals submitted in Co P. 213(35), expires on the31st December next.   I have received from  the Chamber ofShipping, on behalf of the Tramp  Shipowners&apos; Committee of that body, a request that the subsidy  should be  continued and madeavailable, if the conditions warrant it, during each of thenext three years.   The proposal  to continue the subsidy isenclosed in  the latest report of  the Tramp  ShippingAdministrative Committee (Cmd. 5291).   (2) The measures of assistance given by  the government during the last two years to the Tramp Shipping industry have saved it from bankruptcy.   Unemployment among Britishseamen has been diminished,  and the number of laid-up british ships has been greatly reduced (see Annex I).   As will beseen from the Table in Annex II,  freight rates have risenin the last  few months.    It is  not impossible that thesum of  2,000,000 made available  for 1936 will be reduced inaccordance with the sliding  scale condition that,  if the
 averages  level  of freights  over  the year rises above  92%  of  the level  in 1929.,  the amount  of  subsidy will be progressively reducedi   Despite the  improvement   in   freights during the past few months the  conditions  are not yet present for permanent revival  in the  shipping industry.   We have to guard against a recurrence of  the circumstances prevailing only  two  years ago, which would rapidly undo  all the good which our assistance has                                           t done during the last two years  directly and indirectly.   (3) My colleagiies will  also  no doubt have in mind the importance of a substantial Tramp Shipping Industry  to our national defence.    From this point of view it is not enough that the industry should  have been enabled over the last  two years to keep  its head above  water.   Our defence requirements -postulate a healthy  shipping industry with resources adequate to the rehabilitation and  expansion of the tramp fleet.         Present Position of the Tramp Shipping Industry.   (4)   There has been  little real change in either  of the  two main factors responsible for the depression in shipping.    The statistics of world  trade  indicate  that over the last two  years there has been a small but steady increase quarter &quot;by quarter,but the  last available figures  indicate a volume still about 20%) less  than in 1929.   On the other hand, the volume of worldshipping  tonnage has only been  reduced to about 97f$  of thevolume in 1929, and has  now begun to grow again.   Contraryto the position in many foreign countries, the volume ofBritish  tonnage has  continued.to decline since 1931, and therehas been  a decline in the class of tonnage engaged in the tramptrade.    Even under  subsidy conditions since June,  1935, thedecline in tramp tonnage is 44  vessels aggregating  115,000 tons.
    (5) Rates of  freight have continued to improve yet theaverage for the first nine months of this year is only 84^? of  the1929 figures.   As I have pointed out above, these conditionscannot be regarded as firmljr established.   As might he expected the financial position of the industry, according to suchpublished information as is available regarding the working  oftramp shipping companies in 1955-5, is somewhat better.   It  will,however, in my opinion, take several good shears to enable theindustry to repair the ravages in their financial structure  causedby the years of depression.    (6) Moreover, the costs of operrfbing tramp ships  (in common with other british ships) have substantially increased in the course of  thisyear as a result of concessions which have been made by shipownersin respect of wages and hours of work,     (7)  There has been no change for the better in respect  of subsidies granted 103- foreign Governments, and, in fact, all  the indications over the last year point to the determination on  thepart of foreign countries to extend and make more effective  theirsubsidy pal icy.                Results of .the Tramp Shipping  Subsidy.    (8) In my memorandum (CP.213( 35)) last year I explained  themethods by which the Shipowners had satisfied the requirementslaid down as a condition of subsidy regarding co-operation.These requirements call for co-operation among the Tramp owners and between them and the Cargo Line Owners in order to ensure  the effectiveness of the subsidy, and to prevent it actingdetrimentally to the interests of any section of British shipping.This co-operation has been continued with increasing successduring the present year.     (9) Owing to the state of the grain harvests conditionsproved, in the first six months of this year,  to he exceptionallydifficult for tramp shipping, especially in the Plate trade.
9 P   The  figures  collected by  the Administrative Committed show that in that  trade,  in which is to be found the largest number of tramp  ships,  the number of Charters during the first six months of this  year was less than half the number in the corresponding period of  last  year.   Despite these circumstances the Tramp Shipping Administrative Committee, by energetic and decisive action,  were able to prevent any break in freights, but only at the  cost of  imposing severe restrictions on the freedom of ship- owners to  offer their vessels in the market.  The unqualified success  of these measures justifies the machinery of co-operation and  it is  t&amp; the continued existence and effective working of this machinery  that  the shipping industry must look to secure the stability  of conditions which are essential to their preservation and  progress  during the next few years.   (1Q)  The  Cabinet will appreciate, however, that the strain which  is imposed upon owners in obeying the injunctions of the Administrative  Committee in such periods is very great; and without  the backing of the subsidy, the responsible leaders of the  industry  are convinced that it would be almost impossible to secure universal observance of the minimum freight schemes.   A large  proportion of tramp tonnage in the United Kingdsm is owned by small companies,  which cannot be expected to have the resources  which may enable the larger companies to hold fast at difficult  periods in order to secure remunerative freights.   (ll) Such  considerations have led the industry, with whose opinion  I  agree, to the conclusion that the support of the subsidy  is necessary in present circumstances to the continued existence  of  the machinery of co-operation,  but I am assured that the Administrative Committee are doing their best to findmeasures which would ultimately enable the co-operation to bemaintained without the aid of a perpetual subsidy from public funds.
   (12)  At the time the subsidy was introduced, representa-tives of the Liner Companies expressed serious apprehensionsabout its effect on their position.  They even went so far as tosuggest that the Government should provide a sum of money to compensate them for the damage which they thought the subsidy would cause.  As I anticipated (and told them at the tine)their fears have proved unfounded.  This point was dealt with inthe Second Report of the Tramp Shipping Administrative Committeewhich includes representatives of Liner as well as TrampShipping Companies;  and the beneficial results to liners arenow generally acknowledged.  The following is the relevantquotation from their Report (Cmd. 5084, para. 8)        &quot;It is now clear that any damage to liner interests     of which some were apprehensive at the time when the     subsidy was granted has not materialised, largely as a     result of the loyal co-operation of both sections of -the     Industry.  On the contrary there is ample evidence that     liners throughout the world have benefited from the     effects of the Act and the system of freight co-operation.&quot;     The Report then gives particulars of the increased freight rates which Liner Companies had been able to obtain in a numberof important trades.                           CONCLUSION.   (13)  To sum up:-     (a) A large and efficient mercantile marine is necessaryto this country for prosperity in peace and for defence inwar.     (b) Our tramp shipping has been gravely weakened financiallyby the disastrous conditions which prevailed, since 1929.     (c) The assistance given in the last two years has provedeffective first in arresting the delcine in that portion of
 the  industry  and  then  in improving  its position.      (d) A continuance of  satisfactory conditions is necessary to enable tramp shipping to establish its position and replace its  tonnage.      (e) The  present improved  conditions depend in part upon  the effect  of the minimum  freight  schemes based on the subsidy.      (f) If international  trade  should, decrease or the present distribution  of shipping should  Biter so as to bring about shorter voyages,  or if the world tonnage available increases  (as is at present the tendency), the international and. national competition of tramp shipping  for the cargoes available would quickly bring about the conditions which would have existed in the  early months  of 1936 if the  minimum freight scheme, based on the  subsidy,  had  not worked.      (g) In such  circurnstances tramp shipping would return to the  state in  which it was  in 1955 and 1934, when the Government felt bound to come to its rescue.     (h) It has to be remembered  that the co-operation brought about by. the  subsidy has benefited not only tramp shipping but liner shipping.  Its withdrawal would worsen the position of cargo liners  as well as of tramp ships.  (14)  In these circumstances I propose- that Parliament be asked to authorise  the Board of Trade  to pay subsidy to Tramp shippingup to an amount not exceeding  2 million during next year (1937) on the same general terms and conditions as before,  including theprovision by which the subsidy is proportionately reduced if theaverage level of freight rates during the year rises above 92% ofthe 1929 level,  and is extinguished if that level is attained..It will no doubt be appreciated that even though,  as a result ofthis provision,  no subsidy ultimately becomes payable,  shipownerswill not be certain of this until the year is well advanced,  and.the possibility that subsidy might become payable should serve asa sufficient incentive to then to observe the conditions ofco-operation.
                                                         28.9   (15.)  The Chancellor of the  Exchequer.&apos;, whom I have consulted,agrees with my proposals hut is anxious that  it should he made clear to the shipowners that  their plans should, he laid on the definite assumption that the suesidy will cease at the end of next year.   In the event of my colleagues accepting my proposals,I will take steps to convey to the  shipowners the warning .suggested by the Chancellor*   (18.)   Accordingly I ask for authority to have the necessary legislation prepared on these lines and to submit it to the HomeAffairs  Committee, with a view to  the introduction of a Bill,If the subsidy is to be renewed the necessary legislation mustbe passed before the 51st March, 1937&quot;..   (17.)   Soraj) and Build Scheme.         The scheme provided for in. the British Shipping(Assistance)  Act, 1935, by which  a sum was made available foradvances to shipowners who were building or modernising tonnage to replace tonnage  scrapped, will  expire next February, and Ido not propose to suggest its  continuance.    The scheme, which required two tons of British or foreign tonnage to be scrapped -for every ton built, has resulted  in the building of some 45modern and efficient tramp ships of 175,000 tons in place oftwice  that amount of obsolete tonnage.    About half the tonnagescrapped was British, the remainder being foreign tonnage botight&quot;by British owners to comply with the scheme.   The scheme has there fore had a two-fold effect.    It has improved the efficiency of the British Mercantile Marine by substituting for 175,000 tonsof ohselete vessels an equal tonnage of modern vessels, and it hasremoved 175,000 tons of foreign shipping from the freight market.It has also created considerable employment in United Kingdomshipyards.                                          17.
