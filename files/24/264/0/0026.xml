We  circulate  for the consideration  of our          colleagues a  report which Sir Frederick.  Leith-Ross has          prepared at our request  summarising his  impressions          and suggestions in regard to China.

               Financial Mission to China0     &quot;         1                    Rjs commend, at ions.          The primary object of my mission to China wasto seek a solution of the acute currency crisis causedby the American silver-purchasing policy.  This object was achieved as the result of the abandonment by China ofthe pure silver standard and the adoption of a managedcurrency last November.  The currency reform thenintroduced has up to the present proved unexpectedlysuccessful and no serious difficulty has been experienced in maintaining the exchange at the levelfixed.  The Chinese Government have still to complete the programme of reform by re-organising the central bank as an independent reserve Bank and by balancing theBudget 5 but the main danger to the currency is the constant menace  of Japanese intervention and if a better understanding could be reached between Japan and China,there would be every reason for feeling confidence inthe Chinese currency and for anticipating a definiterevival in Chinese trade generally.  Mr. Rogers, of theBank of England, who accompanied me to China, isreturning there, on the invitation of the ChineseGovernment, to advise the Central Bank, in whichcapacity he will be able to render valuable assistancein the completion of the banking re-organisationcontemplated.  I have circulated to the Departmentsinterested more detailed notes setting out myimpressions of the situation in China generally and thepresent memorandum is directed to formulating suchsuggestions as I have in regard to British policy andBritish trade.  It should be borne in mind that,
although during my stay in China, I studied the situation as well as I could,  these suggestions are based on personalimpressions derived  from the data at my disposal and theymust be correlated with information available from other sources 0      (1). Publicity.          First and foremost, if we desire to maintain our interests in the Tar East3 every suitable opportunity should be taken to emphasise that this is our policy.At present British prestige in China stands&quot;highj  butthere is a widespread feeling, both in Chinese and inBritish circles, that in the stress of European preoccupa-tionsj His Majestyfs Government take little interest inChina or in our trade with Chinas   and. that our policy isto abandon our position or at least not  to make any effort to maintain it.  This impression affects the Chineseattitude to British proposals and discourages our merchantsfrom initiating new ventures.  It can to some extent be counteracted by arranging more publicity both in Chinaand here,   Occasional articles in the Press reviewing the situation in China, such as those written by theSecretary of the China Association and published in the times last year are useful.   The publication of anannual report from the Ambassador summarising develop-ments in China, and commenting upon them from the pointof view of British interests and policy, would be  of greater value;   Still more important are Ministerialstatement So  These are cabled fully to China, are  -eagerly s tudied and commented on at length in the localPress.  If Ministers would from time to  time introduce
into statements on foreign affairs a few well-chosensentences emphasising His Majestyfs Government&apos;ssympathy with the rehabilitation of China and our desireto maintain and develop our trade there it would greatlyencourage our traders and help to maintain our influence with the Chinese Government          But3 of course5 in the end our continuedinterest in China can he proved only by the adoption ofan active policy on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government,e.g.  in pursuing diplomatic representations to theJapanese Government and in working out appropriatefinancial assistance to China.      (2) Policy towards  Japan.          It is very difficult to formulate any very definite recommendations in regard to Japana   TheJapanese military undoubtedly aim at the domination ofChina? or at least of North China, through a subservientChinese administration and they will do all they can to weaken the Nanking Government so long as it opposes thispolicy.  There are many shades of difference in Japan asregards the extent to which9 and the pace at which,this policy should be pursued, but in the absence of joint military pressure by the Great Powers,  or inter-vent ion by the U.S.8.S. alone, no Government in japan is likely to renounce it entirely and the main check onits pursuit will probably be the degree of resistancemet with from the Chinese.  On the other hand, we could use our influence with the Japanese Government to urge upon them a more reasonable policy towards China.   At thepresent time, both the Japanese Government and the Japanese,military authorities are definitely anxious to maintain                   -3-
good relations with the United Kingdom;   and theyrepeatedly assured me that they had no desire to prejudice British interests in Chinao    We should makethe most of these assurances and our Embassy in Tokyoshould not hesitate to emphasise to the  Japaneseauthorities, in a most friendly hut quite firm manner,that they cannot expect the relative ons between the twocountries to improve unless these verbal assurances are carried into practical effect.   In particular, we should press tirelessly for the abandonment of  the Japanesecampaign for &quot;autonomy&quot; in forth China,  which, involvingas it does the wholesale smuggling of Japanese goods,and the disruption of the Customs service, threatens both our trading and. our financial interests  in China, andwhich, if allowed to continue, will undermine both thepo3.political and financial stability of China.,     (3)   Personnel of Chinese Customso     As the result of numerous discussions with Japaneserepresentatives, the Japanese Government offered toagree that the successor to the present  Inspector-General of Customs should be British provided thatwe were willing to agree that a Japanese national shouldbe appointed Deputy Inspector-General and that he shouldbe succeeded in this post by another Japanese nationaloNo commitment would be made as to the more remotefuture but this arrangement would, it seems to Hie,meet the immediate necessities.   The Japanese, morehesitatingly, asked that there should be some consulta-tioh between the two Governments as to the individuals
Q&apos;4to &quot;be nominated, to these posts.   This may createsome difficulty as the appointment of the chiefCustoms officials rests, and must rest, with the ChineseGovernment who would gravely resent any arrangement which gave the Japanese a deciding voice in theirselection;  hut some informal consultation might hearranged &quot;oy which the officers recommended for appoint-ment might be mutually notified.     The Japanese Government are also pressing for anincrease in the number of Japanese officials in thecustoms service and they appear to aim at securing atleast as many Japanese as there are British officialsemployedo   This is perhaps not unreasonable from their point of view5 but we also wish to secure fresh re-cruitmeht of British officials, no aew appointmentshaving been made for over ten years.    The Japaneseoppose this on the ground that it will render moredifficult the additional recruitment of Japaneseofficials which they desire.   But if we agreed  inprinciple to their desiderata, no doubt some compromisecould be arranged, by which, say, one new Britishofficial would be appointed to every two additionalJapanese officials, until the two nationalities were equally represented.    (At the same time, a certainnumber of appointments would also have to be made ofother nationalities.)     I have suggested that advantage should be taken of Sir H. Knatchbull Hugessen&apos;s visit to Tokyo tosecure an agreement between us and the Japaneseauthorities on the above lines.    There would still remain the question how the Chinese Government couldbe persuaded to give  effect to  such an arrangement.
sTThe Chinese Government wills as stated above s  resent any agreement made between us and Japan for distributingappointments in the Chinese customs service and theJapanese representatives at Hanking may well  presentthe proposals in such a form as to foment friction.    Iam inclined to think that we and the Japanese should  eachapproach the Chinese Government separately9 with our  agreedrequests9 but in the first instances the method of approach to the Chinese Government should be discussed with theJapanese Foreign Office at Tokyo0     (4)   Customs Tariff.     The Chinese Customs tariff has been increased inrecent yearss particularly as regards textiles., to aprohibitive point.   The Japanese have frequently-protested against these tariff increases,!  unfortunatelythey have linked their demands on this point  up withthe question of smuggling and have urged sweeping-reductions of the t ariff so as t o make smuggling un-profitableo   Phis is not a practicable proposal, asthe native industries of China need a considerable measure of protection against Japanese goods.    But Ibelieve that a careful revision of the Chinese tariffcould be undertaken which would give some satisfaction to the Japanese demandsg help our trade and increase  theCustoms revenues on which Chinese financial stabilitylargely depends:  and I think that wo should  continueto press the Chinese Government to undertake  such arevision0     (5)   Export creditSo     The main opening in China for British exports,in present conditions% lies in the supply of  capital goods and particularly machinery for power plants and                   -6-
other public utilities;;.   To obtain such contracts withthe public authorities concerned, the arrangement ofextended credit facilities is essential.   The export credits Guarantee Department should be in a position toassist our exporters in this way:  but up to the present it has not been possible  to arrange,&apos;through the export credits Guarantee Department, terms such as cur Germanand American competitors  are in a position to offer andthe credits arranged have been undertaken by theBritish firms concerned on the basis of their own resources.   The extent to which they can do this is naturally limited and Government assistance would materially help to secure further orders.   Conditionsin China are substantially different from thoseprevailing in more organised countries and it may bethat a special scheme will have to be devised to  meet these conditions,.   I would recommend that the export credits Guarantee Department should undertake to cover a proportion, say 40% or preferably 50$, of the risk ofany public utility contract in the Yangtse Provinces,and perhaps even in other parts of China, at a premiumnot exceeding 5% and without priority, provided thebankers, merchants or manufacturers are willing tocarry the remainder of the risk.   I believe that the risks involved will hot prove, in fact, so great asthey appear on paper;  and the commercial houses, whichwill be responsible for 60% of the risk, can be left toobtain such security as is available.    If the above proposal is not feasible, the  possibility should be examined of guaranteeing a credit to the Chinese
f&apos;7Government, on the lines of the recent credit to theSoviet Government, for financing railway equipment or public utility contracts entered into with British firms.Such a credit would be of special value in regard to railway equipment orders.   Apart from large contracts,,the possibility should be explored of export creditsfacilities being made available for ordinary trade goods,Go go textiles, and also of guarantees being granted toBritish Merchants in China, instead of only to exportershere.   I cannot emphasise too strongly the importance which i attach to the question of export credits on which  I                                                           wdepends the main possibility of expanding OVLV expoi^t trade Ito China.   I am very glad to hear that the Export Credits LGuarantee Department has arranged&apos;to send out a special representative to China and I hope that he, working in conjunction with the Commercial Counsellor at Shanghai,gwill be able to frame a satisfactory system which will                                                           IBenable guarantees to be arranged locally and promptly for  Mall suitable projects.     (G )  Railway.. Loans.          China also needs long-term capital for development purposes, particularly Railway construction.Until recently, any such loans were out of the questionowing to the defaults on many of the existing loans.During my stay in China, the Chinese Government arrivedat settlements of several of the British Loans indefault and made offers, in the other cases, which in myopinion were reasonable and should be accepted.   the door, is therefore, open for new financing and a smallloan, for the completion of the Rangehow - Ningpo
Railway., was issued while I was in China.   But a largerscheme  is  justified and would, I &quot;believe, prove very helpful, both  in improving internal trade in China andin promoting exports of railway materials from theUnited  Kingdom.   I think that the Consortium Banksshould  be  induced to examine the possibility of a loan of, say,  10,000,000 -  15.000,000 for financing theimport  of  railway materials for the new construction which is now being undertaken by the Chinese Governmenton the  basis of internal loans supplemented by bartertransactions.   The loan should, if possible be ofan international character and it would require to besecured on the Customs surplus.   For this purpose theChinese Government would have to arrange with the domestic bondholders to give the new loan priority overdomestic loan  charges:  but this could, I believe, bearranged.   It would also be necessary for the ChineseGovernment to  arrive at an understanding with Japan inregard  to  the  smuggling situation:   but subject to this,the Japanese Minister of Finance assured me thatsuch a  loan would not be opposed by the JapaneseGovernment so  long as Japan obtained orders for materials  in proportion to her participation in theloan.   A  similar proviso would no doubt be insistedupon by all the other participants in the loan:   indeed,the only possible basis for any such operation atpresent would be that each country should obtain orders in proportion  to the capital subscribed.   the consortium is at present  bound by an understanding infavour  of &quot;open tender&quot; and the first step is for theBritish members of the Consortium to request a revision of this understanding.    It should not  be diffi-cult to secure agreement  on this point but in the
absence of agreement, it is for consideration whether weshould not free ourselves from our Consortium obligations and frame a. proposal for a joint loan on. the above basis withany other national group interested.    The Japanese and belgians would, I believe, be willing to co-operate.           If it appears that market conditions make theissue of any market loan impossible,  it is for serious consideration whether a guaranteed loan or credit to China,for the purchase of railway equipment in this country, shouldnot he made.   Apart from the useful orders which ournianufacturers would thus obtain,  such a loan would greatly increase our prestige, would help us to obtain the agree-merit of the Chinese Government to our requirements (e.g.in regard to the Customs personnel) and would contribute to the financial and economic rehabilitation of China, onwnicn our trade depends.   it would be particularly helpful.tc Hong Kong if such a loan could he arranged for financingextensions of the railway system In Kwangtung (including a loop-line joining the Canton-Kowloon and Canton-HankowRailways) and the re-establishment of the authority of theCentral Government over Kwangtung gives a favourable opportunity of which advantage ought  to be taken.           One other factor in connexion with railway orders should be mentioned.    It is important to secure the appoint-ment of British engineers, wherever possible,  on the ChineseRailway system.    The German and American engineers make every effort to secure orders for their countries and it would help to secure orders for British manufacturers if british engineers, of the right type, were in key positions.The position is different to-day from what it was in 1925.The foreign staff now in question would not be represent-atives of the bondholders but would be appointed by theChinese Railway administration with a view to increasing
the efficiency of the service.   In. the recent settlementof the Tientsin Pukow Railway default, such an appointment was provided for and I am sorry to learn that no interesthas &quot;been taken in this proposal by the Departments and thepanics concerned at home and that difficulty is being experienced in finding any candidate for the post.   I thinkthat the British and Chinese Companies should take steps tocompile a list of possible candidates for such appointments.     (?)   Boxer Indemnity Agreement.           The Anglo-Chinese Indemnity Agreement of 1930has enabled.us to secure some very valuable orders for railway equipment.    But I found considerable, and apparently  justifiable, complaint both as to the -prices charged and as to the serviceability of the goods supplied.This latter complaint related particularly to the largeorder for Vulcan locomotives for the Canton-Hankow Railway.Pull details have,  I understand, been reported to theDepartment of Overseas Trade and the complaints shouldbe carefully investigated with a view to securing atightening up of the system,  so as to obviate similar difficulties in the future.            The- China Indemnity Fund also provides for anumber of Chinese students to be sent to British Universitiesfor education.   This is a most valuable use of the fundas every Chinese returned student tends to be a propagandistfor the country in which he has studied and the majorityof Chinese  students are at present trained in the UnitedStates of America,  Germany or Japan.   The British council should be invited to consider, with the organisations ofBritish Manufacturers, whether they can arrange facilitiesfor more students to study here, particularly in thevarious branches of engineering, or if that is not possible,whether they could endow British lecturers or provideengineering equipment for Chinese Universities.    Such                   -11-
assistance by training the young Chinese engineers inBritish methods, would be of great potential value in securing future orders.     (8)   Co-operation with Chinese.           In present conditions in China, it seems to meessential that British officials and traders should establish as wide contacts as possible with the Chinese.So far as I could judge from ray own experience it is fareasier to get difficulties settled, or proposals amended to meet our views, by unofficial discussions than byformal representations.   Prom this point of view, it is most desirable that business firms should encourage their permanent staffs to learn Chinese;  and the same thingapplies of course, to the Official Services in China.The Chinese authorities seem not only willing but anxiousto obtain advice from persons in whom they have confidence.British traders have in the past had the reputation of standing rather aloof from the  Chinese,  but  the best firms are now fully alive to the necessity of working as closely as possible with the Chinese and securing their co-operation.   While I was in China,  unofficial Sino-British Trade Councils were established by the localBritish and Chinese Chambers of Commerce at Shanghai andHankow to promote friendly discussion of all questions of mutual interest.   The Chinese Government also agreed, inprinciple, to the establishment  of an official committee at Nanking to which difficulties of British tradersresulting from action of the Chinese authorities couldbe referred.   It was arranged that the commercial counsellor should prepare a definite project for the
Ho % he  successfully  carried into effect.      (9)   Brittsh,Bank s In China0           The policy  of the British Banks,  in China, and particularly of the Hongkong  and Shanghai Bank, appears  to me to need a radical revision if they are to maintain their position there.  Their main business hitherto has  been that  of pure  exchange banks and their prosperity has depended on the  constant, fluctuations in the value  of  reilvers  With the  stahilisation of the Chinese exchange, this  business should cease and they will be  compelled to  give greater  attention to the financing  of  trade.   At present they do a moderate amount of  business with British merchants  but the facilities they  offer to these might well  be extended; and their  relations to  the Chinese must be improved. On this latter point, the policy of the Chartered Bank compares favourably with that of the Hongkong- and Shanghai Bank, which  appears to prefer nursing its frozen assets in China rather than co-operating with the Chinese banks to re-organise the concerns  affected.The Hongkong  and Shanghai Bankrs policy is directed by the Hongkong office  and it is not likely to be altered save as the result of experience.   But the Governor of the Bank of England might be asked to discuss the whole position with the London Committee of the Hongkong andShanghai Bank and with the Chartered Bask.     ( ^0)  Relations of Diplomatic and Consular Off i-oers           to.. Trade!&quot;         &quot;   f           I  heard a number of complaints from Britishtraders as to the attitude of H,M. Embassy and ConsularService to their difficulties.   As regards the Embassy,                            -13-
isthe Ambassador, and they should be remedied by the arrangement made under which the Ambassador will residefor considerable periods at Nanking,,   He should also arrange to pay frequent visits to Shanghai;  indeed,from many points of view, it would be preferable if the embassy was located in Shanghais   The present divisionof the Embassy Services between Peking, Nanking andShanghai constitutes a real handicap to efficiency andthe more the^. can be concentrated either at Nanking or at shangai the better.   As regards the Consular Services,the complaints appeared to be more substantial and tomerit close investigation.    I have no means of judgingthe official work of these officers;  but the unofficialcontacts which I had with them left me with theimpression that something is wrong.  Some of theofficers - in particular the Consuls-General at Cantonand Tientsin - appeared to me admirable;  but in other places there was evidence of staleness, discouragementand indifference.    Moreover, the Consular Service, as awhole, seemed to have inadequate contact with localChinese banking and business leaderse  I suggest that the consular Services in China and Japan should he carefullyinvestigated by one of the Inspector-Generals of the consular Service and that the personnel should be reviewed In the light of his Report.  I also suggestthat the Head nf the Mission should convene conferenceswith the local Consular officers at the Embassy or at other centres, when he is on tour, so as to give them&apos;more opportunities of exchanging views both with him andwith one annther0                    -14-
      (11). .Brlti.sh ..Position la Shanghai.        Shanghai  is  not China, and some of the characteristics of Shanghai  are not  altogether creditable to the british merchant  coiumunity  there.    All the same, Shanghai is a remarkable monument  to British enterprise in the developmentof China ana it remains the centre of British interests inthat country.   The  position  of the Settlement should bemaintained as fully  as possible.   Provided  that theadministration gives aue consideration to the reasonabledemands of Japanese  residents in the Settlement, our predominantly-nant position there  is not likely to be challenged by Japan:ana the difficulties between  China and Japan elsewhere have for the time being made the Chinese less anxious to press for a radical change in the position of the Settlement whoseexistence is helpful to them  in many respects.   The ad-ministration should  however be improved ana the Settlementauthorities  should be ready to examine complaints, both fromthe Japanese (e.gs on provision of schools) and from theChinese (e.g. on  tax privileges) ana to meet reasonablerequests.      (! ).,. gosijbji,on of Hong kong        The present position  of Hong Kong is not a happyone.   Economically,  a part of China,  the colony is facedby an ever-growing tariff wall ana is feeling more and more the competition of ports like Shanghai which are inside thatwall.   The  difficulty was accentuated by the currencypolicy followed by Hong Kong  in 1935 and 1936:  and some improvement has taken place since the currency change madelast December.    But the permanent future of the colonydepends on the possibility of traae with China and thequestion should be considered whether it would be possible
for Hong Kong to enter into a Gust6ms Union with. China.   Oneof the Chinese Ministers suggested to me that the ChineseGovernment would welcome a proposal of this kind:  while theGovernor of Kong Kong recognised that it would he greatly tothe advantage of Hong Kong.   I did not pursue the question,as it obviously involves important political issues, hut itappears to me well worthy of exploration.   Whether this ispossible or not, every effort should be made, now that theChinese Government has re-established its authority overKwangtung, to secure better relations between Hong Kong andthe Chinese authorities in the mainland, who are, I believeanxious to establish closer co-operation with the Colony,,  (13)  Another question, raising political issues of adifferent kind,  is the question of linking up the Indian andBurmese Railways with China by the construction of a new&apos;line from the present terminus m Burmah to Yunnan Pu.   TheChinese Minister of Railways has a scheme on hand for building a line to Yunnan Fa from Kweiyang, with a link to the Canton-Hankow Railway,  and expressed the desire to interest HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the extension of this line  toBurmah.   It would obviously open an important new tr^deroute to China overland and I submit it for investigation bythe&apos; Departments  concerned.        To sum up, my suggestions are that:-     (l)   Every suitable opportunity should be taken,especially in Ministerial statements, to emphasise our continued interest in China ana our intention to maintain our position there.     (2)   The Japanese Government should be told in a friendly but firm manner that the prospect of better relations with the United Kingdom depends on their respect-ing our interests in China, which are threatened by theirpresent policy of disruption ana particularly by thesmuggling in East Hopei.
     (5)   We should seek an agreement with the JapaneseGovernment as to the foreign personnel of the CustomsService.     (4)   V;/e should urge the Chinese to undertake a revision of the Customs tariff,  with a view to reducingprohibitive rates and increasing the revenue.     (5)   Export credits are essential for the encourage-ment of British trade with China and the Export credits guarantee Department should be invited, to devise a scheme,suitable to conditions in China,  and to put it into force as rapidly as possible.     (6)   The Bondholders Committee should be urged to expedite a settlement of existing defaults on the basisof the offers made by the Chinese Government.     (7)   The British banks in the Consortium should be requested to work out a proposal for an internationalRailway Loan,  on the basis that  orders for materials shouldbe allocated to the countries participating in the loanin proportion to their respective participations:   for thispurpose the present understanding that all orders shouldbe placed by open tender should  be abrogated.   If a marketloan is not possible,  the grant  of a guaranteed loan orcredit for the purchase of railway equipment in the UnitedKingdom should be seriously considered.     (8)   Every effort should be made to secure theappointment of British engineers  on the  management of chinese Railwas^s and a list should be prepared of suitable Icand.ida.tes for such appointments.                                                           1     (9)   The arrangements for  the placing of orders bythe Boxer Purchasing Commission  should be overhauled so as Ito ensure that the materials supplied are suitable and     I                                                           Ithe prices charged reasonable.                              &apos;\-
     (10)   Every effort should he made to help Chinese    -students (particularly engineering students) to come toBritish Universities and to send British lecturers and/oreouipment to Chinese Universities.     (ll)   Co-operation with the Chinese is essential for modern trade with China.     Support should he givento the unofficial Sino-British Trace Councils formed at shangai and Hankow,  and every effort made to securethe establishment of an official Sino-British TradeCouncil at Nanking.     (12)   The Governor of the Bank of England should beasked to consult with the Kong Kong and Shanghai bank and with the Chartered Bank as. to the possibility of improving facilities for British trade in China and asto the policy of these banks  generally.     (IS)   The Embassy and Consular&apos; Services should be urged to pay more attention to British trade:   and the consular Service should,  in particulrr, be overhauled..     (14)   The position of the International Settlement at shangai does not appear at the moment to be in any danger:but every effort should be made to maintain it and to imprcveits administration.     (15)   The possibility of Hong Kong joining in a customs union with China should be examined^     (16)   The advisability of linking up the Indian andBurmese railway systems with  China by the construction of aline to Yunnan Fu should be examined^                   (Signed)  F, W.
