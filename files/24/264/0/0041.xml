219 1.    During the  passage of the  Unemployment  Insurance Bill, 1934, there were demands for the inclusion  of &quot;Mack-coated workers&quot;, with rates of remuneration above  the present  limit  of   250 a  year, in  the unemployment insurance  scheme.    All manual  workers are already included, whatever their remuneration.    These demands,  which received a good deal of sympathy in the  House,  were met by a  promise to refer the matter to the Unemployment Insurance  Statutory  Committee for  examination.   The Committee&apos;s Report,  which was made last  February and has been published, is  in favour of  action.   A copy  is attached. 2.    The Committee recommend unanimously that the present limit should be raised;  the Chairman and four  members suggest  a new limit of  400, the other two members  300.   The recommendation of the majority is made on the ground  of the -present gross anomalies described in ligj 17 to 23 of the Committee&apos;s report and  of the proved  and felt need for greater security among the classes of  workpeople concerned^   The Committee estimate that perhaps 400,000 persons would be brought into unemployment insurance by the raising of the remuneration limit to  400 and that this would involve an  additional  State contribution to the  Unemployment Fund of some  800,000 a year.   Owing to the subsequent decrease in the weekly rate  of contributions  this sum would now be about  720,000 a year. 3.    I consider that an overwhelming case exists for raising the  limit  to 400 * the minority proposal of  300 is admittedly a mere attempt to &quot;tidy-rup&quot; marginal cases and does not meet the needs of the situation - and that, although we have made no promises, public opinion  is prepared for  theSECRETC.P.266(36)C A B I N E T.wwumim  INSURANCE.Remuneration limit for non-manual workers.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour..
points which we must consider as regards the relation of thisproposal to other parts of the social services, in particular, to health and pensions insurance and unemployment assistance.^&quot;   Relation to Health and Pensions Insurance.     The remuneration limits for this form of insurance are now the same as for unemployment insurance and a change as regards thelatter may probably excite demands for a corresponding change asregards the former.   I understand that the Minister of Health and secretary of State for Scotland would see great difficulty in increasing the income limit for compulsory insurance for health and pensions, both on financial grounds and in relation to the medical profession.   Moreover, we have promised an extension of voluntaryinsurance for pensions to persons above the present remunerationlimit ( 400 is proposed I understand as the income limit for this)and persons coming in will have to pay much more than the rate of contribution under compulsory insurance:  the reception of thisproposal may be less favourable if the same class of persons are tobe compulsorily insured against unemployment at the ordinary ratesof contribution.5.   These difficulties are real.   But I think we should find our-selves in at least as great a difficulty if we proposed the voluntaryextension for pensions and did nothing as regards unemploymentinsurance.   The alternative of applying voluntary insurance to unemployment is not possible;  in the words of the Statutory Committee(para.3l) it &quot;would mean, a disastrous selection of bad risks againstthe Unemployment Fund&quot;.   Some classes of workpeople - whatever thelevel of their remuneration - have a nearly certain prospect thatsooner or later they will be unemployed;  others have - or maytbink they have - an equally certain prospect that their employment will continue while they remain fit for work.
                                                                &amp; % J.Corresponding  considerations do not apply to  siclcness  or old age,Thus while the extension of health or pensions insurance may bevoluntary, the corresponding extension of unemployment  insurance mustbe compulsory.6.   The relations with health insurance are discussed  at some  length in paragraphs 29-34 of the Statutory Committee1 a report.   Many  of theirarguments apply equally to pensions insurance and they  state inparagraph 32 their conclusion, with which I agree, that &quot;in respect of remuneration limit, the two schemes of social insurance should be dealtwith separately each on the merits of the particular case.&quot;7.   Relation with Unemployment Assistance.     The scope of unemployment assistance is limited to that compulsorilycovered by the Pensions Scheme.   If, therefore, the remuneration limit for compulsory insurance is altered for unemployment but not for health and pensions the class of persons brought into unemployment insurancewould under the present law remain ineligible for unemployment assistance.   This is scarcely a defensible position.   It can, andshould be remedied by extending the scope of the assistance scheme so asto include these persons.    In any such extension persons brought in,just as they would receive the same rate of benefit and pay the samecontributions as others under the insurance scheme, would be eligiblefor assistance under the same Regulations as those applying to otherswithin the assistance scheme.   It would further be desirable, I think,to lay down some initial contributory qualification before applicationsfor assistance could be entertained;   this is important for purposes of definition and would also ensure that the persons concerned would ingeneral qualify for and exhaust benefit before coming on to assistance.This course would, however,  make it necessary to defend the refusal of
                                                                9 9 9assistance to &quot;black-coated.&quot; workers who are unemployed when thescheme is launched.  These are points which I should propose towork out in consultation with the Unemployment Assistance Board,As regards the cost to the Exchequer the Statutory Committee were unable to make any estimate of the rate of unemployment in this class, and it is still less possible to forecast the number who might be eligible for assistance.  On the conditions I have indicated the cost would not begin to arise for at least twelvemonths and thereafter might be of the order of three-quarters of amillion a year.8,   The case for the change in unemployment insurance is such thatI think we should not wait for further pressure to be brought upon us - as it certainly will if we delay - and that we ought to decideat once to proceed on these lines, in order that a Bill may be announced at the opening of Parliament.  I ask for a decisionaccordingly, and for authority to prepare the necessary Bill,(Intd.)   E.B,25rd. October,. 1956.H.Q. 1,101-65 J.P.

UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE  STATUTORY                    committee report ON REMUNERATION LIMIT FOR INSURANCE OP NON-MANUAL                -      -    WORKERS.To the Rt. Hon. ERNEST BROWN, M.P., Minister of Labour.SIR,   ;                                    ...Reference, Procedure, and Representations from Persons Interested.   1.  On 27th February, 1935, your predecessor in office as Ministerof Labour referred to us,  as the Unemployment Insurance Statu-tory  Committee, the question of raising the  salary limit  for unem-ployment  insurance  in the  case of non-manual workers.    the reference was made in pursuance of an undertaking given on 2ndMay,; 1934,  when the Unemployment Bill  was under  discussion in the House of Commons.  A  motion had been made for the in-sertion of a new clause, inquiring  the Unemployment  insurance statutory  Committee, as soon as might be after the passing of theBill,  to make such proposals as seemed to  them practicable forthe insurance against unemployment  of &quot; persons employed inoccupations  other than manual occupations receiving a  salary ofnot more than  500 per annum &apos;&apos; and of several other classes of per-sons.  The insertion of the clause was resisted  by the Minister ofLabour, on the ground  of  the pressing duties already imposed on the (Statutory Committee, but an undertaking was given thatthe Minister would  do all that he could to ensure, as soon aspossible, that the case of the non-manual workers  and  the other cases had  the full consideration of the Committee.  The reference in regard  to non-manual workers was made to  us accordingly, forconsideration and advice,  under section  19  (6) of the Unemploy-ment Insurance Act, 1934, (which has now become section 57 (1)of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935).   2.  At the same time the Minister of Labour  gave public notice,through the  press and otherwise, that  the matter  had been re-ferred to us,  and asked that any representations thereon  by bodies or persons interested,  should be sent to us  by 21st  March, 1935.Although  a  number of representations were received within theallotted period, it  was evident  that many organisations, both ofemployers- and workers who would be affected  by  an increase inthe. salary limit, had &quot;not expressed  their views  on the- matter.  it became evident  also, in  view  of our other duties,  that it wouldbe impossible for us to make any report in regard to non-manual workers before the summer  vacation.   We decided accordingly,in April last, to postpone till the autumn the taking of oral evidence
 on this matter, and meanwhile to obtain as fully as possible, by direct enquiry, the views of those likely to be interested.   With this object, on 18th April, 1935, we issued  a  letter  of  enquiry to 39 organisations of employers  and  workers representing profes- sional, commercial and  administrative  classes.   At  a  later  date similar  letters  Were issued  to a number of organisations in the teaching profession.  The purpose of these enquiries was to obtain,. if possible, some idea of the numbers  of persons who would be affected by an increase  in  the existing remuneration  limit; the extent to which unemployment now occurs within that class; what provision already exists for assisting such persons during periods of  unemployment;  whether  the extension of compulsory Unem- ployment  Insurance&apos; was desired;  if so,  what  new limit  would. be favoured;  and finally  a statement of the  grounds on which the views on the  last two points were based.  3.  By these  steps we have  ensured, so far as we could,  that notice  of  the matter under  consideration was distributed widely among the persons likely to  be affected.  Nor has any time been lost by  this procedure.   Any recommendation that we  may  make for  changing  the remuneration limit  in respect of non-manual workers, like our proposals  for  insurance  of agricultural  workers, requires legislation  to bring it  into force.  Such  legislation would clearly have been impossible last session.  Our report is in time for this session, should His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to  act on it.  4.  In supplementation of the  written replies to our enquiry, we took oral evidence from all the associations which expressed  a de- sire to appear before us, as  well as. from the  government depart- ments  concerned, that  is to say the  Treasury,  the Ministry of Health, the Department of  Health for Scotland and the  Ministry of Labour.  In addition to  the representations from associations,we have received a very.large number  of letters  from individuals. Altogether the subject of this  report has  been under consideration byus at eleven meetings between 7th March, 1935, and .7th.February,. 1936; at eight of these meetings oral evidence has  been taken.. We desire to express our thanks for the help given to us by all who have submitted evidence.  5.  The  particular provision  of  the  unemployment  insurance scheme  on which we have to report  is set out in paragraph 9 ofPart  II of the First Schedule to the  Unemployment  InsuranceAct of 1935.   That paragraph  defines as one of the employments excepted from unemployment insurance :-      &quot; Employment otherwise than iby way of manual  labour and    at a rate of remuneration exceeding in value two hundred and    fifty pounds a  year, or,  in  cases where  such employment in-    volves. part-time service  only, at a rate of remuneration which,    in the opinion of the Minister, is  equivalent to a rate of re-:.    muneration exceeding two hundred and fifty pounds a year for    whole-time service.&quot;35301
   There is an identical exception in the National Health Insurance Act of 1924,  but the exception from compulsory insurance is there accompanied  by a provision allowing an insured person to continue insurance  as  a voluntary  contributor when he has passed the re- muneration limit of  250 a  year.  A voluntary contributor can qualify for sickness benefit and pensions but not for medical benefit. There is no corresponding provision for continuation of voluntary insurance  against unemployment.   6.  The  letter  of  27th  February,  1935, from the Ministry  of Labour  bringing this matter before  us  speaks  of  raising the &quot; salary&quot;  limit and  the  term  &quot;salary &quot; has been  used by many of those who have made representations to us.   Others, including the Royal  Commission on Unemployment Insurance in  1932, have spoken of  the &quot;income &quot; limit.  The term used in  the Unemploy- ment  Insurance  Act is  neither  &quot; salary &quot;  nor &quot; income &quot; but &quot; remuneration.&quot;  In the rest of this report  we use this statutory term,  as being more correct  both  in form and in  substance.  As will appear later, it is of the essence of  the problem before us that the limit is based on a rate of remuneration, and  has nothing  to do with income over a period of time.   It is  of the essence of the problem, also, that the limit applies to persons who would normally describe their remuneration as wages, rather than  salary,  and are practically indistinguishable from other wage-earners.   7. Till about 1929, there was general acceptance  of the existing exception.     Employers did  not desire  to  have their burdens in- creased by an extension  of compulsory insurance,  and most em- ployees probably felt  that, on passing the remuneration limit, they were  passing  into a  sphere with little risk of  unemployment and no need for any provision that they could not make by  personal saving.  In the past five  years, the  attitude of  many  employees has been changed, no doubt as a direct consequence of the depres- sion.   From 1930 onwards insecurity of  tenure spread into sections of the population who had  felt  themselves immune from unemploy- ment; a persistent demand began to be made by  various associations of professional and clerical workers in favour of  raising the  remun- eration limit.   The  Royal Commission  on Unemployment Insur- ance who considered  the question,  came to the  conclusion in 1932 that,  so far  as  unemployment insurance was  concerned,  it was desirable, on general grounds,  to raise the limit  from  250 to  350 a year.  But  they felt it  desirable for administrative reasons to maintain the  same  limit  for  the  several  branches of  social in- surance, and  they  expressed  the opinion accordingly  that  the income limit  for  unemployment insurance should  not  be  raised unless and  until the income limit for health insurance was raised.  8.  Since  the date  of that report, it seems  fair to say that thedemand for extension  of unemployment insurance has strengthened.With  very  few exceptions, the evidence tendered to us from the side of the employees has been in  favour of  raising the limit.
 Journalists, Architects,  Correctors  of  the Press and others con- nected  with the Printing  Trades,  Textile managers, Coke-oven managers,  Colliery Under-managers, Navigating Officers, Marine Engineers, Chemists, Shop Assistants,  Actors,-Musicians, Theatri- cal Employees, Life Assurance workers all  these, so far as they are represented by the associations that have  come before us, have pressed strongly  for  an  extension  of  compulsory  unemployment insurance.   In Banking and Insurance  we have had,  from associa- tions of employees,  views both for and  against  extension.   Only in one or two occupations such as those  of Chartered Accountants and  Solicitors  Clerks-have the  employees  uniformly taken the opposite view.  In the large and important occupation of teaching, nearly all  the views expressed  to us were hostile  to any raising of the remuneration limit.   The  great bulk of teachers  could not in practice be affected by  any change  in the limit,  since they would remain  excepted from  insurance under  other provisions of  the First Schedule to the Act, along  with with  civil servants, muni- cipal  employees,  the police  and  most railway servants.    Some branches of teaching, however in  proprietary and private schools  would  be  affected  by a  change of the limit, and here  also most of the views expressed  to us  were in  opposition to  any change. One  association of teachers, the London Supply Teachers&apos; Associa- tion, urged  the raising  of the limit.   It seems  clear  that,  with few exceptions, Ministers of  Religion are  not  employed  under con- tract of service, so that the level of their remuneration  is irrelevant.  Subject  to  the reserves noted  above,  in the  occupations  that are affected  substantially by the remuneration limit,  the  views of the employees, so far as we  have  been able to ascertain them, are all  but  universally  in favour of raising the limit  above its present  figure of  250 a year.  9.  On the side of the employers, there is still, in  the main, opposition to  any  change in the  limit.  A comprehensive  state- ment of the grounds for this opposition was given to us in a letter from the National  Confederation of  Employers&apos; Organisations.  It was  pointed out that,  owing to the fall  in the  cost  of living,  a salary of  250 a year at the  present time is equivalent to a salary of  496 a year in 1920 when the present  limit was fixed,  and that the effective operation of  the limit has, therefore, been materiallyextended.  Further it would be a disadvantage to have  different limits for  Unemployment Insurance,  Unemployment Assistance, Health  Insurance  and  Contributory Pensions  Insurance, and ifthe limit were raised for Unemployment Insurance, the issue would arise of making  a similar increase in  the  limit  for  the  other services, for  which industry is already  required to  bear  heavyburdens.    The Confederation, it  was added,  have  no  evidencetending  to show that the amount  of unemployment amongst non-manual  workers above  the  present  limit, would  justify their in-dusion within the scheme of compulsory Unemployment  Insurance,   35301                                                    A 3
or that there is  any substantial or well founded demand  for thechange.  Some organisations of employers, while holding that there wasno  need for the extension of Unemployment  Insurance  to  theirown industries, took the view that, if  there were  general agree-ment in favour of  an extension,  they would not oppose it so faras their own industries were concerned.   The opinions of thevarious Chambers of Commerce and of  such bodies  as the News-paper  Proprietors&apos;  Association,  and the  Corporation of InsuranceBrokers were divided.  10. The  Co-operative movement occupies a  somewhat  special position;  the Societies  composing it are employers  but they are themselves  composed  of  employees.  The  Parliamentary Com-mittee of the  Co-operative Congress expressed themselves as infavour of an increase from the present  figure  of  250 a  year to 400 a year, although security  of tenure  among the  employees of Co-operative Societies was held by  them to be greater  thanamong the  employees of  private  traders.  11. A  brief summary of the views expressed to us  by  associa-tions is given  in Appendix A; it illustrates the great  variety ofoccupations  affected.   The  views  expressed to us  in  individualletters  were nearly all in favour of extending insurance by anincrease in  the salary limit.   This, perhaps, was to be expected.Those  who were indifferent or opposed to extension,  would be less likely to write.                Working  of Remuneration Limit. -  12. Prom  this review of representations  made to us, we   pass to consideration of the  working  of the  remuneration limit.   Thelimit applies only  to persons employed otherwise  than  by   wayof manual labour.   Persons  employed  by way  of manual labourremain insured, though they  may be earning  six,  eight or  morepounds a  week&apos;.  The application of the limit involves, therefore,two  assumptions : first,  that a satisfactory practical distinction canbe drawn between manual labour and  other work; second,   thatthose excluded by the limit are not liable to a  risk  of unemploy-ment comparable  to the  risk of  those  not  excluded,  or  such asthey cannot meet by private  saving.  13. The first of  these  assumptions does  not  stand the  test of examination.  The  note supplied to us by the Ministry  of  Labourand printed  as Appendix B to  this report shows that the distinctionbetween those  employed by way of manual  labour,  and those not so employed, is  in many cases  so fine  as  to  be unreal.  other cases of  like import were  brought to our notice in  evidence.  Itwill  be sufficient  to mention the chief types  of difficulty that  arise in drawing  the distinction.
  14.  One  difficulty  is  that,  in  many occupations, the duty  ofsupervising others, which is not manual labour, is combined  in varying degrees with the duty of sharing in manual labour oneself.This difficulty  is illustrated by  the  first  three cases mentionedin the Ministry of Labour note, of the dairyman&apos;s foreman, theforeman tailor&apos;s cutter,  and the chief dental mechanic, as wellas by several other cases which were brought before us in evidence.  There is, for  instance, the butcher&apos;s  manager who in a smallshop may  do  a great deal  of manual  work  himself while alsosupervising others, and in a large shop will be mainly supervising.There is  the  chief electrician or master carpenter in a theatre ;the  extent to which  such heads of  departments are merely super-vising, and the  extent  to which they  should from time to time&apos; take off their coats  &apos; and work,  is a matter  of dispute and vary-ing  practice.   There  are the navigating  and  engineer officers  in ships.  The subtlety  of  the distinctions involved in such  cases,between small and large ships, is well illustrated  by  the memor-andum 285X issued by the Ministry of Health in February, 1935,to deal with  their cases.   In all  the  occupations cited, and  inmany others, an employee  may  pass  into and out of insurance,as, in passing from  one shop, or ship, or theatre to another,  hecrosses the almost invisible line  between mainly supervising andmainly working himself.  15.  Another difficulty is that distinction between the &apos; manual  &apos;work of using a hand guided by the brain, and the &apos; non-manual  &apos;work of using a hand as the instrument of the  brain, is by nowunreal.  The typist  who strikes the keys of a typewriter, or acomputor  who  strikes  the  keys  of  a  calculating  machine,are  held to be  non-manual, while a compositor  striking  the keysof a linotype  or monotype machine is held to be manual.   Presstelegraphists and correctors of the press are non-manual, but work together on the same terms  with their fellow craftsmen.   Litho-graphic artists are sometimes held to be employed by way of manual labour and  sometimes not.  But  it  is  needless  to  multiply  instances.    The  difficultycan be put in general terms.  In innumerable occupations  nearlyeverything in the nature of hard physical &apos; labour &apos;  is performed by machines; it has  been laid down formally in a decision of theHigh Court, that manual &apos; labour &apos;  and manual &apos; work &apos; now mean the  same  thing.   The  skilled manual labourer of the past hasbecome to  a  very large extent  the  supervisor  of a  machine  ormachines, as the &apos; non-manual &apos; foreman is a supervisor of men.  16. There is yet  another difficulty brought about by  recent HighCourt  decisions  that  acrobats and professional footballers personsunquestionably using physical strength and physical skill are em-ployed not by way of manual labour but as &quot;  public performers &quot;,or as  being &quot; engaged  as exponents for exhibition purposes and   35301                                                   A 4
to amuse and entertain other people at playing a game.&quot;  these decisions, as is  stated in the Ministry of Labour note, overruledprevious decisions of  the Ministry of Labour in a contrary sense;they exclude such employees from insurance if  their remunerationexceeds  250 a  year, but not otherwise.  17. The difficulties cited above  relate to the term  &apos; manual labour &apos;.  A fresh set  of  difficulties  arises  in  the interpretation of the remuneration  limit.   The  First  Schedule, as  cited above,excepts from insurance non-manual employees if they are employed&apos;  at a  rate of remuneration exceeding in  value  two hundred  and fifty pounds a year &apos;.  This form of words appears to contemplatesalaried  persons,  who would reckon  their  remuneration by  theyear.   When the limit  was introduced for health insurance in1911, the figure of  160 chosen for the limit, corresponded to thelimit  then in force for  exemption  from  income tax; those whoearned  enough to be subject to income  tax were to be treatedas either not liable to unemployment,  or  able to make their ownprovision for it.   Those who framed the limit clearly had in mindannual income.  18.  In practice,  the remuneration limit is not and cannot  be interpreted in this way, with reference to annual earnings.  Theexception applies whenever  the rate of remuneration exceeds  250a year, however short the  period  of  employment.   250  a  yearmeans in practice &apos;  4  16s.  2d. a week &apos; ; this  in turn means 2s.an hour for a 48 hour week, 2s. 8d. an hour for. a 36 hour week andso on.  In consequence, the limit  excludes  from insurance many people whose work is irregular,  so that they are paid at relatively high rates by the week, or the hour, but who never expect to earn 250  a year or  anything near it;  they may have  lower incomes and more unemployment than many of those covered by insurance.Actors, musicians, variety artistes and others connected with publicentertainment are  all liable to  find themselves  in this  position.All of them  may be excluded from insurance,  because  they are paid  5 a week while performing, though  they have little prospectof earning even as much as  200 in the year.  In regard to  eachof the three occupations just named  there  is a  further anomalycalling  for notice.  19.  In the  case  of actors, the special  anomaly  arises  in  con-nection with rehearsals.    The actor&apos;s contract  not  infrequentlyprovides for remuneration during the period of  performance only,but requires  the actor to rehearse beforehand without remunera-tion.   Thus an actor may receive  5 a week for eight weeks  run of a play, and have to spend two weeks before it rehearsing with-out pay;  during those  two weeks  he is  not  available for other work.   Over the ten weeks as  a whole he earns only  40,  buthe is not insured because his pay is reckoned as   5 a week.  even where  the contract provides for some, but a lower, payment duringrehearsal, the same anomaly may arise.
  20. In the case of musicians, a special anomaly arises  throughthe fact that  their services  are required as a  rule at fixed timesfor short periods,  so  that the normal working week is  a shortone, if reckoned in hours.   In a memorandum  282X  issued  bythe Ministry  of Health,  dealing with musicians and others en-gaged  in public entertainment, it  is  laid  down  that  &apos; normallyattendance  at  the  place  of  entertainment for 36  or more hoursweekly constitutes  whole  time employment &apos;  for  musicians.   Re-muneration &apos; at the rate  of  250  a year &apos;  means  accordingly, asa rule, remuneration at more than 2s. 8d.  per hour.  In  fact, itappears to be  common in many places for  musicians to be hiredas regular  members of an orchestra under  contracts requiring 24to 30  hours attendance a week.   If,  under such contracts,  theyare paid as much as  3 5s. Od. or   4 Is. Od. a week, their hourlyrate works  out at more than  2s.  8d.  and they are excluded  frominsurance,  although they may find it impossible to get other workexcept  very occasionally,  or may  need to rehearse  in  their owntime in order  to maintain their qualifications  and  their post.   in either  case their earnings are much less than  250 a  year.  21.  In the case of variety artists, the position is complicated bythe fact that  persons  who perform independent turns axe  not, ingeneral, held  to be employed  under  contract  of  service,  becausethey are not acting under the direction of  an employer.   It  was put to us in evidence that a clown engaged as a regular  memberof a circus company would, be held to  be under contract  of service,and insurable  (unless  excluded by remuneration limit) because heperformed  as and when directed by the employer, but  that the sameperformer  doing the same thing at  a  fixed time and  place, as oneof the  turns of  a music hall entertainment, would be an independentcontractor  and  not  insurable, however little he were paid.  Thispoint  has  nothing  to  do  with the amount of remuneration,  butwe mention it for  completeness, and as illustrating the  general question of the limits  of  social insurance.  22.   In  regard  to the remuneration limit itself,  the  anomaliesarising in  all  irregular occupations  are obvious.   Some of thosewho opposed any raising  of the limit, recognised the injustice ofthe  position just described;  they  made various suggestions forexcluding  from insurance only those   whose actual  earnings in ayear exceeded   250.  None of those suggestions appear to  us prac-ticable.  It is necessary for employer and employee to&apos; know, at thetime of employment, whether an insurance contribution  is payableor not; this cannot be left  to be determined by the degree of successof the employee in obtaining other work during  the next twelvemonths or any similar  period.  Any system of annual assessmentsfor insurance  liability  would cause far more  trouble than it  was worth.  We are satisfied  that  a remuneration limit  for insuranceliability must be based, as the existing  limit is based,  not on annualearnings, but on weekly or  hourly rates of  pay.  Any limit must  35301                                                  A 5
for practical reasons be a remuneration limit by the hour or weeknot  an income limit by the year.   23. Any such limit,  as has  been pointed out, tends to produceanomalies  in irregular  occupations  with rates of  pay  near  thelimit.   These anomalies, though brought prominently  before us inthe entertainment industry, are in no sense confined to it.  Anotherstriking illustration was given  to us  on  behalf of the correctors ofthe  press.   In this non-manual  occupation, the  minimum wagerecognised by the association is   4 14s.  Od.  a week for 48  hours,that is to say Is. lljd. an hour, representing a rate of remunerationjust below  250 a year because it is less than 2s.  per  hour.  Thisminimum wage, however, applies only to men employed regularly,or for two full weeks at least.   For casual  employment from  day to day the minimum wage  is 2d. more per hour, that  is to  say, is2s. IJd. per hour.  This being more than 2s. per hour, is treatedas remuneration at a rate exceeding  250 a year, and excludes  theman  receiving it  from  insurance.   The regular  employees withrelatively little risk of unemployment are insured; casual employeeswith  a high risk  of  unemployment  are uninsured.  The regularemployee  who loses his post, takes casual  work if he can get it;indeed he is compelled  to do so, on  penalty  of losing  his benefit;by doing  so, he leaves an insured  for an  uninsured occupation.The same man, on the  same work, may pass repeatedly into  and out of insurance,  through crossing the  remuneration  limit,  as inother occupations men  pass into  and  out  of insurance, throughcrossing the line between working manually themselves and super-vising the  work of others.   24. We have described at some length  the  anomalies involved in applying the  existing remuneration  limit.   They  arise from  thefacts, first,  that the  distinction  between manual and  non-manualwork to-day  is often so  fine as to be unreal, and second, that  thelimit is and  must be a  remuneration limit and  not an income orsalary limit.   If, nevertheless, such a limit were necessary to pre-vent the extension of unemployment insurance to classes of persons for most of whom it  was unsuitable  or unnecessary, the  retentionof the limit might be  justified.   This,  however,  is not  the case with the existing limit.  The second assumption named above, asinvolved in  the present  limit, namely that persons excluded by there are not subject to serious risk of unemployment,  fails, like the firstassumption,  to stand the  test of  examination.    In  face,  of  the representations made to us, we  cannot  doubt that there is a  feltneed for  insurance in   most of the classes or  occupations nowexcluded on the ground of their  remuneration.   There is, in fact,unemployment for which provision should be made.   It is impossibleto give any statistical estimate of the extent of this unemployment,but it is possible to describe several forms  of it.   25. There are, first,  a number of  occupations, in which,  owingto the special skill  required, the  rate of remuneration  is relatively
 high,  but  in  which there is at  all times a good deal of irregular and casual employment; actors, musicians and public entertainers of all kinds, journalists,  and correctors of the press, typify this form of unemployment above the present remuneration limit.  Second,  the severe contraction of some of our staple industries  coal, cotton,  shipping and of international trade in general,  has thrown out  of employment in large numbers  managers,  under- managers,  and administrative, technical,  and  clerical  officers of all kinds, and has reduced them in many cases to circumstances of dire need.   It  may be said  that the  condition of  those  industries is exceptional.   But  there can  be  no assurance that  catastrophic changes of like character will  not occur again, in these or other industries.  Third, the general depression of 1930-33 has shown  the existence of insecurity, and has spread the sense of insecurity, far beyond these particular industries,  among classes of employees who in the past have felt themselves to be almost immune from unemployment. Banking,   insurance, architecture  and retail  distribution are cer- tainly not  at the moment  occupations affected by exceptional de- pression;  but in all  of  them  we  have  evidence of desire,  among those  employed, for provision  against the  risk  of  unemployment above  the  present remuneration limit.  26.  It is,  no doubt,  true that in  nearly all industries salariedemployees  above the present limit are normally less  liable to dis-missal than those in less responsible positions; they are older men,with longer experience of their employees business.   On the otherhand,  if misfortunte  does overtake them, they may,  for this veryreason, find it particularly hard to regain employment.  Unemploy-ment  probably does not  affect  as  large a  proportion of  thoseabove  the remuneration  limit as of those  below, but it is likely tobe obstinate in the individual case.  This is one of our reasons forsuggesting, as we do below, that any extension of insurance to pro-fessional and  other workers above the existing remuneration limit should be accompanied by the organisation of a specialised employ-ment exchange service.   In view of the proved existence  of  in-security among such employees and of  their  special difficulty inobtaining  fresh suitable employment, once they have  been dis-placed, machinery for place finding  is almost as important  as  in-snrance,  27. The  fact of insecurity is in itself the answer to the objectionraised  by  some of  the organisations  of employers  against adding to the  burdens of industry  by extending insurance.   We are loth  increase the  burdens  on  industry  represented by contributions for social insurance.  But this should not be admitted as a reason ior continuing to exclude from insurance classes who need  insur- ance and cannot  without anomalies foe distinguished from the rest of the  employed population.
  28. On a variety of grounds, accordingly,  we  are  led  to  thesame conclusion as  the Royal Commission in 1932,  that, for unem-ployment insurance considered by itself, the existing remunerationlimit for non-manual workers is unsuitable and ought to be raised.It remains to consider  three further questions.  Is  it  possible to change  the remuneration  limit in respect of unemployment  insur-ance alone, without reference to health insurance and pensions?  Ifa change is made, what new limit, if any, should be adopted?  Arethe new insured contributors, brought  in by a change of the limit,to come into the general  scheme on the same terms as others, or should any  special provision  be made  for  them?                 Relation to Health Insurance.  29. The conclusion of the Royal Commission in 1932 has beencited already.   They  held, on  administrative grounds,, that  theschemes of health and  unemployment insurance should, so  far aspossible, be  co-terminous, and that no change in  the limit shouldbe made for unemployment insurance, unless and until the samechange  was  made  for other forms of social insurance.  30. There is, of  course, a substantial administrative advantage in having the  same boundary for all the  schemes  of  insurance.But  this advantage has not been held in the past to be a reasonfor making the schemes co-terminous, where there appeared to be strong reasons against it.  Private domestic servants and agricul-tural workers have  been included for health  insurance and pensionsbut excluded from unemployment insurance. After discussion withrepresentatives of  the  Ministry  of Health and  the Ministry ofLabour, we  are satisfied that there would be no serious  administra-tive  difficulty  in  having  different remuneration   limits for non-manual workers, in different schemes of social insurance.   If, on merits,  the  remuneration limit ought to be raised for  unemploy-ment insurance and ought not to be raised  for health insurance orpensions, a distinction  can be made between the two services, with less  difficulty  than is involved in  many  other administrative problems.  31. Nor  is  it hard  to  find grounds for making a  distinctionbetween the two  schemes.  Some  of the  difficulties,  indeed, inadministering the present remuneration limit  apply to health in-surance as they do  to unemployment insurance.  But the financialliabilities involved  in raising the limit are  of a different order of magnitude, in  the two  cases.  And, in relation to  health and pen-sions, the needs of  those who wish to continue insurance after theyhave passed  the limit, can be met, and to an increasing  extentare being met, by voluntary insurance.  This method is not applic-able to unemployment, where voluntary insurance would mean a disastrous selection of bad risks against the  Unemployment Fund.
  32. No doubt many, if not most, of those who  came before usto urge the  raising of  the remuneration  limit  for  non-manual workers in unemployment insurance, would like to raise the limitalso for health insurance and pensions.  But they all made it clear,in  response  to  direct  questions,  that  they  wanted  extension ofunemployment insurance for its own sake, and not simply or  mainlyas  a precedent  for use in  another connection.   We are satisfiedthat, in respect of remuneration limit, the two schemes  of social insurance should be dealt with separately,  each on the merits ofthe particular case.  33. If,  as  a consequence, the limit is raised  for unemploymentinsurance and is left unchanged for health insurance,  it will follow that some people  will be insured against unemployment but  not against sickness.  This involves a risk of loading the claims  on theUnemployment  Fund by people who are really unfit for work,  andwho would draw sickness benefit if they could, but, not being ableto do so,  will claim to  be capable  of work in order to get  unem-ployment  benefit.   But, in  view of the lower general risk  of  un-employment  that we anticipate among those who will be brought in by raising the limit, it would be unreasonable to regard this  riskas a serious  danger to  the  Unemployment Fund.  The  conversedanger of including under health  insurance  large classes (in par-ticular domestic servants and agricultural labourers) who were  not covered for unemployment  and might therefore be  led  to makeclaims  for sickness benefit  during  periods of unemployment,  hasbeen borne without  serious  damage for many years. 34. We  agree accordingly with  the opinion  expressed by  theEoyal Commission in 1932 that the present remuneration limit fornon-manual  workers  under unemployment  insurance  should  beraised.  We  do not agree  that this  change  should depend uponmaking a corresponding change at  the  same time in health insur-ance.                  The New  Limit Proposed. 35. There remains the question of what new limit, if any,  shouldbe  substituted for the rate  of   250 a  year that is now in  force.Some of the arguments set out above, as to the  difficulty  of  dis-distinguishing between manual and non-manual work, lead logicallyto the  conclusion that any attempt to make this distinction  shouldbe abandoned.   This would  mean either :      (1)  Applying a remuneration limit equally  to manual  and   non-manual work;  or      (2) Having no remuneration limit ior either class. Unless the new remuneration limit were put very high above 500 a year the first plan would cut out from insurance a certainnumber of manual workers who are now insured; wages of  10a week, though rare, are not unknown.  The second plan  would
bring in nearly all salaried persons, however highly paid.  cabinet ministers might still  be held  to be uninsured, along with bishopsand  ministers of religion generally,  as  not being under  contract of service, and Presidents  of Railway  Companies might escapeby certificate of the Minister under Part III of the Pirst Schedule,as permanent  employees  entitled to pension.    But managingdirectors, and many other highly paid  business men and technicians,would be subjected to compulsory insurance.  It  does not  seem  necessary  to  carry logic to  either of  theseawkward practical conclusions.  We  are of opinion that some re-muneration  limit  should continue to  apply to  persons  engagedotherwise than by way of manual labour, though the limit shouldbe higher than at  present.  36. The Royal  Commission in 1932  recommended  raising  thelimit from  250 to  350 a year.  The figure most commonly namedto us by those who advocated an increase was   500 a year. , Inthe absence of definite information as to the numbers of persons at different salary  levels above  2:50, or  as to the extent of unem-ployment among them,  it  is  difficult to give reasons  for choosingone  figure rather than  another.  37. There  are objections to going too high.   The vigour withwhich the demand for raising the limit  to   500,  or even beyondit, has  been pressed  upon  us is due, in  part at  least, to excep-tional circumstances-to the severity of  the recent general depres-sion, and to  the special misfortunes of our staple industries.   Thesupport  for insurance above the present  limit may diminish  as thememory of the depression fades.  On the other hand, an announce-ment that the  Government actually proposed to apply compulsory insurance above that limit,  would probably  mobilise a good dealof opposition which  has not been  roused by  the announcementof our  enquiry; the former attitude of  most  of  the employees concerned, like the present attitude  of  most employers, has beenhostile  to inclusion in the insurance scheme. The higher the newlimit proposed, the  larger will be  the  opposition of  those  whowill resent compulsory  insurance as. unsuitable and unnecessary forthem.   And at some point or other in the  scale of incomes, thequestion. may  be  raised whether the individual should not  look after himself.  Men  of a  certain degree  of  prosperity should not need help from the State in providing against insecurity.  An  em-ployee with a substantial salary is better able to make this provisionthan many  shopkeepers, and men working on  their own account,and small employers who are outside the  scope of unemploymentinsurance.   38. There is danger in not going high enough.  In several of theprincipal non-manual occupations covered by  our evidence suchas those connected with printing, the merchant service,  architec-ture, retail  distribution, textile management, and entertainment of
various kinds-scales of remuneration run more or less continuouslyup to the rate of  500 a year, or.beyond it, according to the degreeof  responsibility or  special  skill required; in most  of those cases,we were assured,  the  risk of unemployment runs also.  In other occupations such as  those of colliery under-managers  and  lifeassurance workers lower general  limits of salary were named, butfew of our witnesses were prepared to accept a figure as low as  350a year as  meeting the  case,  and  hardly any went below it.Wherever the limit  is fixed, there will be people passing  into and out of insurance, as they pass from one job to another; there willbe  people excluded by  high  hourly earnings for casual work though their  annual income is less, and  their need for  insurance  greater,than  among the regular employees  who  will be included.   the anomalies which now present themselves at  250  a  year will allre-appear in diminished numbers  at higher levels of remuneration.Though  it  is desirable to  retain some limit,  in  order  to  avoidextending insurance into regions  where there is no manual workand all salaries  are  individual, it  is important to put the limit, so,high  that no great numbers will  be  affected by  it.  39.  On a balance  of these considerations; most of the Committeeare more impressed by the  danger of  fixing too low a limit  thanby the objection to going  too high.   It is hardly worth  while topass  an  Act of Parliament  for changing  the  remuneration  limit,without  making certain that the change  is large enough to curethe admitted evils.   Continuing  experience, under a  new  limit,of  anomalies such as we have described, would be  a  continuingcause of resentment;  lack  of insurance in  occasional hard  cases,where it was clearly  needed, would be  felt again and  again asan injustice.    On the other hand the  principle of compulsory insurance has now  won all but  universal acceptance;  even thosewho  do not feel the need for themselves, will, as a rule, by theirsense of  community, be reconciled to standing in with their fellows;To most of  the Committee,  accordingly, it appears to be the courseof  prudence to  make  a new limit higher than  that  suggested in1932  by the Royal Commission.   The rate that we propose is  400a year.    This is below the figure  urged on us by most of the organisations representing employees.  But it happens to  be thefigure recommended by the Parliamentary Committee  of  the  Co-operative Congress, a body better qualified than most to look atthis problem from  both sides of the  wage-bargain.   We believethat  such  a limit will be   accepted as a&apos; fair  settlement  of  theissue.  Terms  of Insurance for  Persons  Proposed  to. be  Included.  40.  Most of those who appeared before  us to  advocate  the rais-ing of the  remuneration limit, proposed  no other change  in  thescheme.   They  intended, or assumed, that the&apos; new insured per-sons, above the present limit, should  be  brought in  on the same
 terms as all others paying the same contributions and  receiving the same  benefits when  unemployed.    Some of our witnesses, however, pointed out that,  for men  earning   5 a week and up- wards, the ordinary benefit say   1 12s.  a week for a man, wife and two children, was inadequate provision for loss of employment and earnings.   They argued also that, in all  probability, the risk of  unemployment  among such men,  though sufficient  to  justify insurance, was less than  in the general body of insured persons. If  the persons brought in by raising the limit, like agricultural workers in our proposals  of December 1934, were  given the ad- vantage of their lower risk  of unemployment, they  could receive higher benefits for the same contributions.  Even if it were held to be unfair or impracticable to allow them the advantage of their lower  risk of  unemployment, they  ought  to pay higher contribu- tions and  draw higher benefits.  41.  Manifestly, for loss  of earnings of  6 or  7 a week, benefit in  the neighbourhood  of  30s.  a week is  inadequate insurance.This inadequacy is itself one of the reasons urged against raising the remuneration limit;  the resulting benefit, it is said,  is  not worth  the  trouble involved.  We  have considered,  accordingly,with  some care,  the  desirability  and  practicability of  givingspecial  terms  of insurance  to those  affected  by our proposal  toraise the remuneration limit.  Such  special terms might, in theory,take the form of a financially separate scheme, with different con-tributions and  benefits, like  that  for  agriculture.  Or they might take the form of a supplementary scheme,  adding to  the  standardbenefits and contributions, supplementary benefits,  and contribu-tions adjusted  to provide these benefits at an  assumed lower rateof unemployment.  42. Quite apart from any question of practicability, the objectionson grounds of principle to  a  separate scheme for persons above thepresent remuneration  limit  are overwhelming.  Such persons donot constitute  a separate  industry, like  agriculture. .  They  are found  in  all industries; they can  make no claim to be treatedseparately  for purposes of  unemployment insurance,  or to get  theadvantage of a low risk of unemployment, that could not  be  madeas strongly by  many  others.  43. These objections  of  principle  do not  apply  to  a supplemen-tary scheme.   There  is, in fact, a  lengthy section in the Unem-ployment Insurance Act  (Section 72) providing for  the introduc-tion of  supplementary  schemes  of  insurance, to  give benefitsadditional  to  those of  the  main scheme.   This section has  re-remained a dead letter ; action under  it requires the previous assent of  organisations representing a majority both of the organisedemployers  and of the organised employees affected,  and no  state contribution is  payable.   But since legislation is required in anycase, to raise the remuneration limit,  it would be possible, if this
were thought desirable, to provide  at  the  same time for compul-sory  supplementary contributions and  benefits,  with or withouta  State  contribution,  for those to  whom insurance  was  thusextended.  44. Whether this would be desirable in principle it is unnecessary to consider, for  we are  satisfied that the  practical objections toit outweigh the advantages.  Under such a proposal, it would bnecessary, for the purpose of deciding whether higher or lower contributions and benefits were payable, to make just those fine distinc-tions between manual and non-manual work which produce anoma-lies under the present law; there would be just the  same difficultyof persons  passing into  and out of  the supplementary scheme,that there is now in their passing into and out of insurance.  Thewhole of our preceding  argument tells against any attempt to makedistinctions between those who are now included under insurance and those who are excluded by  the  present  remuneration  limit.The insurance scheme is designed  to  give  a uniform  benefit fora uniform contribution, irrespective of risk  of unemployment  andnormal earnings.   Those  who  need supplementary  provision forunemployment must be left to make it, either by personal saving,or by insurance  through trade  unions or other associations.  45. While in respect of insurance benefits and contributions nodistinction  should  be drawn between insured persons on accountof differences in  their normal earnings, or  standard of life, thereis another respect  in which special treatment  may be called  for.The Employment  Exchanges,  through which insurance  is admin-istered, are designed in general to  deal  with wage-earners ratherthan  with the professional classes.   There  are, however,  already in existence, specialised exchanges for particular types of workers.The problem of unemployment among those who will be broughtinto insurance if our  proposals are adopted,  is likely to  presentspecial  features,  and may call  for the  setting up of specialisedexchanges or departments of exchanges in some  at least  of  theprincipal cities, in order  to render adequate service.                Estimate of Numbers and  Cost.  46. In  submitting to your predecessor, at the end of 1934, pro-posals for extending unemployment insurance to agriculture, wewere  able to  give  an  estimate  based on census returns, both ofthe numbers that  would thus  be brought  into insurance, and ofthe probable rate  of unemployment among them.   In  regard tothe extension which we now suggest,  by raising the remunerationlimit  for  non-manual workers,  it is not possible to make similarestimates.   Nor is it so  necessary.   For agriculture we proposed a separate scheme, with special rates of contribution and benefits,and independent finance; the  income  of the  agricultural scheme had to be  sufficient, but not  more than  sufficient, to cover its
expenditure,  and this depended - directly on the rate of unemploy-ment assumed.  In the present case we propose simply the additionof a comparatively small  number of persons to the general scheme;their inclusion cannot seriously affect the finance of  the scheme,in one direction or another.   47. There  are no statistics available on which to make  preciseestimates of  the number of persons who would  be  brought intoinsurance by a change in  the  remuneration limit for  non-manual workers.  The Government  Actuary,  after  consideration of  such information as the  Inland Revenue could supply,  has furnishedus with an estimate, which  he has given  with considerable re-serve, indicating that the number of salaried persons with incomesbetween  250  and   350 a year is about  400,000, and between 250 and  400 a year is about 450,000.  These figures omit some people who are subject to the present remuneration limit, because etheir weekly rates  are  above   4  16s.  a week though, throughirregularity of employment, their annual earnings fell  below  250.On the other hand,  the  figures include  a  much  larger number ofpersons notably teachers,  municipal and police  officers,  and rail-way officials who, in spite of the raising of the remuneration limit,would still be  excepted  from insurance on  other grounds.  It isimpossible, without  much  further investigation,  to do more  thanguess at the  adjustment that should be made on these  grounds.For the practical purpose of estimating  the  burden that would be thrown on the various parties to insurance, it  seems reasonable to  put  the  numbers that would be  brought into insurance  by raising  the limit from  250  to  400 a year, at about 400,000persons.  This would involve contributions of  800,000 a year eachfrom employers,  employees,  and the State, and  a gross additionof  2,400,000 to the annual income of the Unemployment Fund.   48. If the  limit were  raised, not  to   400 a year, but  to  350,each  of  the  figures just given would be reduced by about  oneninth.  The effect of other changes can only be guessed  at.  Thenumbers at each higher  income scale fall off rapidly.  On general grounds it seems likely that with a  limit of  300,  the figures givenin the last paragraph would be reduced by about a third;  with a limit of  500 they  would  probably be increased by less than 10per cent.   49. As regards the rate of unemployment  among the persons soincluded, it is  impossible to make even a guess.  Some of the mare persons with a substantial or high risk of unemployment.   Butit is hard to  believe that any  large proportion are in this position.And  it hardly  seems  open to question that, over all, they  havean average rate of unemployment materially  less than 16 per cent.,which is the rate at  which, under the financial proposals just madeby us,  the income and  expenditure of the Unemployment Fund;as a whole^ are expected to balance.  It seems safe to assume that
the inclusion on the same terms as others, of those  now excludedby the remuneration limit, would strengthen rather than weaken the Unemployment Fund, though this  is not  in any sense theground of our recommendation.                     Recommendation.  50. We recommend, accordingly, that in  Part II of the  first schedule to the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, setting out theemployments excepted from Unemployment Insurance, paragraph 9should be amended by substituting for  the  present  remunerationlimit of two hundred and fifty pounds a  year, a limit of four hun-dred pounds a year.               We have the honour to be, Sir,                   Your obedient Servants,                                W. H.

        MINORITY NOTE BY ME. AYEE AND CAPTAIN  CEAIG.   1. We are unable to agree that the remuneration limit of  250up to  which non-manual workers are at present compulsorily in-surable for unemployment,  should  be increased  to  the  extentrecommended  by the majority of the Committee.   2. In fixing the limit  at   250 in 1920,  Parliament obviouslyintended to include in Insurance that body of non-manual workerswhich  corresponded in the matter of income with the general bodyof manual workers, and therefore chose  5 a week, or  250 a year,as  representing the figure within  which  the  great  majority  ofmanual workers were  at that time included.  In our present con-siderations it is also necessary to have regard to the effect of thefall in  the cost of living since that time; by reason of this, the valueof the  limit has almost been doubled.   3. Were it not for the  anomalies described in the Majority Re-port, we are of opinion that the  figure of  250 would remain a fair and reasonable limit  for  compulsory  insurance for  non-manual workers, and  that the inclusion of those in receipt of  higher re-muneration is not  justifiable  in a State-supported scheme.   4. We are averse to imposing any further burden upon either the taxpayer or industry, and particularly so as we are not con-vinced that there is a majority  desire for inclusion  amongst  thosewho would  be  affected by the Majority recommendation,  and,  insupport of this view, we were informed by the Ministry of  Healthofficials that in the case of Health Insurance, in which non-manual workers may elect, on attaining a rate of remuneration in excessof  250&apos; a year, to continue as voluntary contributors, the majoritydo not  avail themselves of this right.   5. Prom  the evidence  placed before  us, we  have formed theopinion that where the demand for an increase  in the  250 limitexists,  this  began  during the years of abnormal depression, 1931-1933, when, because of the particular nature of  our  troubles, thereoccurred for the time  being an  unusual amount of  unemploymentamongst non-manual workers.  The very severe depression,  accom-panied  by  reorganisation and  amalgamations,  led  to the  closing down  of   factories,  etc.,  and  caused  unemployment amongstadministrative  staffs.   That unhappy  period is now  past and sucha  condition  of  affairs is not likely to  recur.  The men affected  bythese abnormal causes have by now  very largely  adapted  them-selves  to  new conditions, and  we have not  gathered from theevidence that,  today, the amount of unemployment amongst non-manual workers earning over  250 a year is of serious extent.
  6. While we do not believe that there is a desire for compulsory insurance on the part of the majority of  those  at present  abovethe limit, we recognise  that such a desire exists amongst a con-siderable number of those earning between  250 and  300.  7. We have, moreover, been impressed by the evidence referring to the anomalies which the choice of the particular figure of  250as  the remuneration limit  has  brought  about,  including  thoseanomalies  described  in the  Majority Report,  which have been caused by the necessity  imposed by Paragraph 9 of Part 2 of theFirst Schedule to the Act of 1935 of estimating the income of an individual by the rate of his remuneration instead of by the amountactually received.   Moreover, the present limit  of   250 a year isinconvenient because  the number of persons  earning a  salary ofthat amount is  relatively large,  and a small increase or decreaseaffects their exclusion or inclusion from time to time. 8. We consider that a case has been made out by those whoseremuneration actual or  rated is in and  around the figure of  250a year, for a removal of the grievances from which some of themsuffer. If we could suggest any other method  of dealing with the ques-tion than by an increase of the remuneration limit, we would do so,but the administrative difficulties, which  have confronted us whenany other method has been suggested, appear to be practically in-surmountable,  and  we  therefore  recommend  that  the  presentremuneration  limit of  250 a year should be  raised to a  figureabout, but not exceeding,  300 a year.  This will bring into Insurance a certain number of persons who,in our opinion,  ought not to be  compulsorily insured in a State-supported scheme,  and,  no doubt,  also  a certain number who donot desire to be insured; but it  will at the same time, in a practi-cal degree, remedy the  grievances, and  remove the sense of in-justice, under which many of the  witnesses who came  before usfelt they were labouring, and it is  in our opinion an amply largestep to take from every point of view.

               SlCBMAEY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND EVIDENCE.National Confederation of Employers Organisations.  The  National Confederation  are opposed to  any  increase in  the  salarylimit on trie following grounds:        (1) that  owing to the  fall  in the  cost of  living a salary of  250 at    the present time is equivalent to a salary  of  496 in 1920  when the    present limit  was fixed.  The salary limit,  while  nominally remaining    unchanged, has  therefore  been  materially extended  in  its  effective    operation.      (2) If the limit were raised for  Unemployment Insurance  the issue    would  arise of making a  similar increase  in the  salary limit for  TJnem-    ployment   Assistance,   Health  Insurance  and.  Contributory  Pensions    Insurance.      (3) In  view  of  these possible repercussions  and the heavy burdens    which  industry already has to bear  in respect of  these social services,    this wider  aspect  has to be prominently borne in mind.      (4) The Confederation have  no evidence which  tends  to show that the    amount of unemployment among  non-manual  workers  earning  over    the present salary limit, would justify their inclusion within the scheme,    or that there is any substantial or well-founded demand for the change.Parliamentary  Committee  of the  Co-operative Congress.  In favour  of an increase in the salary limit to   400 a year,  althoughsecurity of tenure among the employees of co-operative  societies  is greaterthan among the employees of private  traders.   The extension is favouredon  the following grounds :        (1) That the development  of  industry  and  commerce is bringing a    larger  proportion of  occupied persons into the non-manual category,    and these workers are not immune from the risk of unemployment.      (2) The present salary limit is  unsatisfactory,  because large numbers    of  non-manual workers  receive  salaries  approximating   to  250  a    year,  and  a small change in either direction affects  inclusion  or ex-    clusion from the scope of unemployment  insurance.    The limit  should    be fixed sufficiently  high to avoid fluctuations of this  kind.      (3) The  economic insecurity of  recent  years  has  increased the risk    of unemployment for  non-manual workers.      (4) The  distinction  between manual and  non-manual workers is  arti-    ficial.   It is  anomalous  that a so-called manual  worker,  earning  over     250  per  annum, should be  insured,  while  a  non-manual  worker  with    a  similar  income and a greater  risk of  unemployment should  not be    insured.      (5)  The  absence of  unemployment  insurance  for higher paid  non-    manual workers gives rise to frequent calls for assistance to meet hard-    ship as the result of unemployment.                  .       &apos;  -   . -  -      (6) The  extra cost by  way  of contribution from employers would be    small  compared  with  the  additional  security enjoyed  by  the workers    affected, and  the  increased efficiency which would  result.British Insurance Association.  The risk of  unemployment in the case of employees  receiving a salary ofover  250  a year  is so small that there  is no need,  and no demand,  in tfieindustry for any increase in the salary limit.
  The Insurance Industry has a special scheme with special rates of contri-foution, and under that scheme, which is in the nature of an agreed scheme,no part of the  contribution is  borne by the employees.  If the salary limit were raised because of the position of workers in otherindustries  it would involve a substantial  increase in  the contributions  of individual  Insurance Companies, and it might  be felt necessary  to press for a revision of the existing arrangement whereby they  pay the whole  ofthe contributions.   The Association accordingly desires that if  the  salarylimit  should be increased under  the  general  scheme, the existing  limit should  be  retained for  the  purposes  of  the Insurance  Industry  special scheme.Corporation  of Insurance Brokers.  Opinion  divided.  Many firms consider that the salaries paid provide a margin for such contingencies which are infrequent,  but firms  employingabout half the total number  of employees  within the  scope of the Corpora-tion were in favour of an  extension of the salary  limit to  350  or  500 ayear, largely because of  the  hardship involved when  unemployment among those excluded from insurance  by  the present salary limit occurs.Banking Unemployment  Insurance  Board.  There appears to be no strong desire for any change in  the present salarylimit for unemployment insurance,  nor does the  extent  of unemployment among those over the present salary limit appear to call for any  increase inthe limit.    If, however, the general consensus of  opinion was in favour ofan increase, the Board would  be prepared to fall into line.Scottish Bankers&apos; Association.  There appears to  be  no need  for  any  change  in  the salary limit forunemployment insurance so far as the banking profession is concerned.Association of British  Chambers of  Commerce.  Opinion among Chambers  of Commerce  is divided.    Some are in  favourof a moderate extension  of the salary limit while others are against it.Architects Unemployment Committee.  In favour of  a moderate  increase in the salary limit.   Employment inthe profession  is liable  to fluctuate,  and  during  the  recent depression itwas necessary to organise a  scheme for the relief of unemployment  amongarchitects and  their  assistants.  It  had been found impossible to make pro-vision  for  unemployment  during  good times, and an extension of unem-ployment  insurance  above the  250  limit  would remove  many of  their difficulties.Chartered Surveyors Institution.  There is no  evidence  of any demand among members  for an  increase inthe salary  limit and the Council of the Institution did not wish to expressany opinion on the matter.Auctioneers&apos; and Estate Agents&apos; Institutes of the  United Kingdom.   Opinion   among its  Branches,  ;Slub-Areas and  Junior  Organisations  is divided; but a  majority are opposed to compulsory extension of unemploy-ment insurance, mainly on  the ground that higher-salaried men would not avail themselves of benefits  and would not be willing to  attend  at Employ- ment  Exchanges.  Those  who favour  an  increase  do  so  mainly  on  the ground that, professional clerks have little opportunity  for providing  against unemployment.
 Land  Agents&apos; Society.   Prefer to leave the salary limit as it is at present. Federation of Grocers&apos; Association.   There does not  appear to be  any substantial case for a change in the present  salary limit, and the Federation is  opposed  to any change, on the ground  of  the heavy liability already resting on  employers in  respect of State  Insurance. Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association.   Opinion divided. Association of Factors, Merchants and Importers of Leather, Hides, etc.   Opposed to any change in the  salary limit, mainly on the ground that it would increase the burden upon industry. Institute of Incorporated Practitioners in  Advertising.   The majority of  those receiving salaries above   250 a year do  not desire an extension of compulsory unemployment  insurance because they  do not regard the burden of contributions as commensurate with -the s risk of the loss of employment.   A proportion, however,  are in favour of raising the salary limit to  400 or   500 a year. Society  of West End Theatre  Managers:  Theatre Managers&apos; Association; Association of Touring and  Producing Managers: Society of Entertainment    Managers and  Musical  Directors.   Opposed to any increase  in the salary limit, mainly on the ground thatthe industry is unable to bear  any further burdens  in view of the risks to which  it is subject and its general financial condition.    Organisations also consider that  there  is no  reasonable  or  adequate  demand, from artistes usually earning over  250 a year, to be insured  for  unemployment,  or any necessity for it. They recognise,  however, that  there may  be hardship in cases where artistes  earn for a  short period a  rate of  pay which makesthem uninsuTable, although  their total  receipts during a year may be much less than  250.Institute of Chartered Accountants.   Raising  of salary limit  undesirable.Society of Incorporated Accountants  and Auditors.   An increase  in the remuneration limit would apply only  to members notin  public  practice.    There is very  little  unemployment among members who earn over   250 a year, and so far as Incorporated Accountants areconcerned  the Society  does  not favour an  increase  in the present salarylimit.   The Society, however, does not feel able&apos;to express  any opinion so faras other  classes of workers may be affected.Incorporated Association of  Architects  and Surveyors.  In favour of raising the  salary limit to   500 per annum.    There hasrecently  been a good deal of unemployment  in the profession, even  among those earning over  250  a year,  and there have been many claims on theAssociation^ Benevolent  Fund.    With regard to salaried members  of theArchitectural and allied  professions,  in the majority of  cases the marginallowed by the salaries earned is insufficient to provide for the  risk  of lossof employment.
 Association of Architects,  Surveyors and Technical Assistants.  In favour of  abolishing  the salary  limit.   It has  not  been possible  to provide for the risk of unemployment among those earning over  250 a year by voluntary efforts. Trades Union Congress General Council.  The salary limit for the insurance of non-manual workers  should be  in- creased to at least  500 a year on the following grounds : -       (1)  The development of modern  industry has increased the insecurity    of employment for non-manual workers.   There has been a change  in    recent  years  in  the   relationship between  non-manual  workers  and    employers.    The former are  not now regarded  so much as  a part    of the firm  as they  used to be.      (2)  The distinction   which  previously existed between manual  and    non-manual work has now largely disappeared owing to the introduction    of machinery  which  can be operated without  manual  work as previously    understood.      (3)  Poor Law Relief  is the  only form of assistance available for non-    manual workers over the  250 salary limit.      (4)  Mergers, amalgamations and schemes of rationalisation have made    the position of  professional workers much more  insecure.      (5)  The demand for  an increase in  the salary limit  on the  part  of    organisations  of  non-manual  workers  is  unanimous.   Non-manual    workers have  greater liabilities, such as house purchase and education,    and in a large proportion of  cases are without resources if they become    unemployed.      (6)  If the salary  limit were raised they would propose to apply the    present rates  of contribution,  and benefits to  the new classes.      (7)  The present machinery of  Employment Exchanges is sufficient,    but the Trades Union  Congress General Council are in favour of special    departments for  dealing  with particular classes of workers.British Association of Chemists.  In favour  of  removing the salary limit.   Have  a membership of about1,800 limited to those who are qualified chemists.   Most of their members are  excluded from the national scheme of unemployment insurance by thepresent salary limit.   While  the rate of unemployment  among their membersis low, unemployment is usually severe when it oceurs.  They have  an Un-employment Insurance Fund  of their own to which a contribution of 2s. 6d.per  unit  per month  is compulsory  for  every member.  Benefit is not paid for the first month of unemployment,  and the maximum amount of benefitpayable in a  year is  26 weeks.   The  rate  of benefit  is  17s,  6d. per week for each  unit of contributions up to a maximum of four units.  In 1925, when three years experience showed  that the  reserve fund wasnot  being increased at the desired rate, the contribution was increased from2s. per month to  2s.  6d. per month, and the rate of  benefit  reduced from 1 per unit per week to 17s.  6d. per unit per week for  members of less than five  years standing.  The rate of 20s.  for members of  more than five yearsstanding was retained.  A reserve fund equal to  four years contributions  atthe  present rate has since  been accumulated.Pharmaceutical Society.  Membership of  the Society comprises all persons  holding the statutoryqualification of pharmacist.   There are upwards of  22,000 members of theSociety,  of whom approximately 10,000 are  proprietor  pharmacists  and
 approximately 12,000 employee  pharmacists.   Approximately  3,500  of  the latter do not come within the present  remuneration limit for unemployment insurance.   Unemployment is relatively  low.    As there is no evidence of the  views of members of the Society iwho would be affected by an increase in the salary limit, the  Council do not feel in a position to offer an opinion upon the desirability of increasing the limit. Coke Oven  Managers&apos; Association.  Includes 95 per cent, of the managers of coke oven plants in Great Britain. They advocate the raising of the salary  limit to   500  a year.   There is considerable fear of  unemployment  among  their  members  arising from changes of management, temporary depression, or the closing down of plants through, centralisation.   Stuggests that if the extension is carried out there should  be no contribution from the  employer, but that  the employee should pay his own and the employees share.   Are also in  favour  of higher con- tributions and benefits for those with higher salaries, and that contributions should be collected at the intervals for which salaries are paid.   They would, however, still be in favour of the raising of the salary limit if the present rates of  contributions and benefits  were  applied. Colliery Under-Managers of Great Britain, and Northern Colliery  Officials     Mutual Aid  Associations.  Represent all  the  colliery  under-managers and overlookers,  and  are  in favour  of raising the  Salary  limit to  500 a  year.  At one time they were much  opposed to  unemployment  insurance since formerly it  was  almost unknown for their members to become unemployed.  Now unemployment is severe and there has been very great  hardship.   Practically every member has  been insured at some time or other and  has lost the value of his oon- tributions through rising  above   the  salary  limit.   The  average  under- manager passes  out  of Insurance  at about  thirty years of  age.    They would prefer higher rates of benefit than those given hy  the General Scheme, but  appreciate the administrative difficulty involved.    In some  areas  the associations have a system of unemployment benefits;  in others the  funds have been exhausted  by heavy unemployment.    An  increase  of the limit to  350 would cover most of their members. Unemployment has been caused not  merely  by the depression, but  also by the  introduction  of machinery for  getting  coal. National Federation  of  Textile Works Managers Associations.  In favour of complete abolition  of salary limit.  (Some members  formerly in receipt of  1,500 a year are now destitute).   The acute depression in  the cotton  industry  has given  rise to a very large  number of  cases of severe hardship.   Although the size of the industry  has been restricted, there will always  be a certain amount of unemployment.   They are in favour  of  the present rates of  benefits and  contributions and it is agreed that a limit of  500 a year would include within  the  scope of insurance about 75 per cent. of mill managers who are now excluded by the present salary limit although they have been insured  in  earlier years. National Federation, of Professional  Workers.  In favour  of increasing the salary limit to  500 a year, subject  to  the retention of the  other grounds of exception from the scheme  of unemploy-ment insurance.  There  has been  a marked change of  opinion  on this point in the last twenty years.  Insecurity of employment has tended to increaseamongst non-manual workers as the  result of economic  depression, mergers and  amalgamations.   A limit of  250 a  year is unsatisfactory  because the salaries  of many non-manual workers  fluctuate  above and below the limit,
with the result that contributions paid for long periods may be lost.   More-over, workers employed on a temporary basis may receive  a rate of remun-eration which takes them outside the scope of  insurance, although their total earnings over a whole  year  may be well below the limit.   The  onlyform of relief in times  of distress open to those who are outside the scope ofunemployment insurance through  the operation of the salary limit is PoorRelief.    The line of demarcation between  manual and non-manual iworkis also anomalous, and the raising of the salary limit for non-manual workers would  tend to reduce the anomaly.   They  propose that the rates of  con-tribution and benefit obtaining in the general scheme should apply to thosenon-manual workers earning over the rate of  250 a year.   The  practicaldifficulties in the  way  of differential rates were considered  to be  almostinsoluble; they  would also be likely to introduce  greater  anomalies.Institute  of Journalists.  In favour  of  compulsory  unemployment  insurance  for  all  hon-manual workers  earning up to  500 a  year.    There should  be a  scale  of  con-tributions graduated according to salary, with higher  rates of  benefit forthe  better paid workers.  The contributions from employers  and the state should be equal  to those from workers, but the  rate of contribution for  aparticular grade should be  governed by  the risk of  unemployment  within that grade.    While there appeared to be a considerable amount of unemploy-ment amongst non-manual workers earning over  250  a year, there wasnot  much among journalists.   The Institute has  a scheme  of unemploy-ment benefits  for their members, under which  3  a week  is paid  for the firstten weeks, followed by benefit at the rate  of. l a  week for a further limited period.   The subscription is at  a flat  rate of   2 2s. a year from  each member.Association  of Correctors of the  Press.  Active membership about 1,200, including about 600 in  the General Sectionwhose  salaries are within the present  limit, about  300 in the  PeriodicalsSection,  in  which the rate of pay is  5 Is. per week,  and  the remainderin  the Morning, Evening and Sunday Newspaper Section where  the  rateof pay exceeds  5 Is. per week.  The workers in the Periodicals Section, whoare  excluded from  insurance  by the present salary limit, work side by side with the men in the General  Trade Section,  the members of which are oftentransferred  to the  Periodicals Section.    There is consequently  a good  dealof movement  into  and  out of insurance  as the result of promotion, and  aworker so promoted might be at a disadvantage if he lost employment,  e.g.,through  the loss of a contract by his employers.    The  limit  of   250  ayear is particularly inconvenient in the case of  these workers since  a  verysmall  increase  in  wages  deprives  them  of  the   benefits of  unemploymentinsurance.   A  number of members are engaged at the minimum wage of 4 14s. per week of 48 hours or Is.  ll^d. per hour.   These men would  becompulsorily insured under the present limit. If, through slackness&quot; of worktheir employment became intermittent, they would thereby become entitledto an  increase in the hourly  rate of 2d. per hour.   This would bring theirrate of pay up to 2s. ljd. per hour, and  would take them  outside the scopeof unemployment insurance, since  their annual rate would thereby be raisedabove  the figure of  250 a year.    In such cases it was quite common for the worker to secure only about 24 hours work in a week and, while suffering a fall in his  total weekly earnings,  he  would  be  removed from the scopeof unemployment insurance.   Members have frequently  refused an increasein remuneration in order to retain their status as insured contributors.  TheAssociation  presses for.the raising of the.salary limit to   500 a year.  Whenunemployment  insurance was first instituted  their  members wished to  be excluded, but since that time there has  been a  marked change of opinion.Their  members  at the  higher wages would be satisfied with  the  rates  ofcontributions and benefit afforded by the  present scheme.
Civil Service National  Whitley Council (Staff Side).  Opposed to alteration of salary limit on the grounds      (a) that permanent unestablished Civil Servants are normally retained     until the age of 65 years, and, therefore,  would not become eligible to     draw unemployment benefit;      (6) compulsory insurance in such cases would  be, in effect, an extra     tax  on a section of the  community;      (c) it would be a hidden subsidy to the Unemployment Fund.Solicitors&apos;  Managing Clerks&apos;  Association.  Not  in favour of a change  in the salary limit.City of Birmingham Municipal Officers&apos; Guild.  Represents 4,500 members of the staff of the Birmingham Corporation, andthe  majority  of members  are excluded from  insurance  by a  Certificate ofException.  Are in  favour of raising the salary limit substantially  becauseof the economic  uncertainty of recent years.    As, however,  the risks ofunemployment are so slight,  a Certificate of Exception should  apply to thehigher ranges of salary as well as the lower.Associations  in Mercantile  Marine.    (Imperial  Merchant Service Guild,     Mercantile Marine  Service Association,  Marine  Engineers&apos; Association     Limited, and Amalgamated Engineering Union).  In favour of an increase of the salary limit  to  500 a year.-  There hasbeen a great change in the circumstances of sea-going employment as  a resultof the severe shipping  depression.    Large  numbers of  officers  are unem-ployed for long periods at a stretch and  intermittent  unemployment hasincreased to a much greater  extent.   It is  estimated that  about one-sixthof the  Navigating  and Engineer  officers at  present serving  have nevercome within the scope  of  unemployment insurance  owing to their havingpassed beyond the remuneration limit before the scheme came into operation,and altogether there are about one quarter of the officers now serving whoare  uninsured because  of  the limit.  There has  been a serious drain  uponsea-faring  charitable funds, and rates and periods of relief  have had to be severely  restricted.  Many shipping  companies now pay  wages  only whilethe  men are on articles  and officers  are stood off altogether between  voyageswithout  pay,  whereas  formerly  it  was the  common practice  to maintainthem on sea-going rates of pay between voyages.  On the  engineering  side it oftens happens that  at  times  officers  workashore  and are compulsorily  insured as manual  workers, but pass out of insurance as non-manual workers when they go to sea.   They  propose  thatthe present terms as to contributions  and benefits should  apply if the salarylimit is raised.  Officers usually pass  out  of  insurance at about age thirty,and accordingly  now  pay  contributions for  about  fourteen  years.Guild of Insurance Officials.  Not  in favour at the present  time of an  increase in the salary limit.Their members are  in  constant  work and dismissals are very rare.  they receive  great  consideration as to sickness  and  employment  from  their eni-ployers and take the view that payment of contributions on their part wouldbe  largely philanthropic.   The  Guild  has  15,000  members,   composed of clerical  and administrative officials.National Amalgamated Union of Life Assurance Workers.  Membership  consists  of  agents,  collectors,  canvassers,  and  other minorofficials.   Have a membership of  approximately 7,000, of whom about 1,000receive  salaries above the   250 limit.  Are  in favour of raising the  limit
to  500 a year.  The reorganisation of the. system of working  in the largeroffices in recent years has had a marked effect on the terms of  remuneration and security of tenure of agents generally.  Agents are now  restricted to particular areas and paid  by fixed salary.   This has resulted in a reductionin agency staffs by several thousands of workers.  Movement  of agents  fromone office to another  is now subject  to restriction, and it  is much  moredifficult to build up  an  agency in a new office.  Unemployment  benefit wouldtide men displaced  over the interval between losing one job and getting anew one.  There is a tendency for the companies to  regard an  agent as un-insurable immediately upon the rate of remuneration reaching   250 a  year,although agency expenses  might amount to fifteen per  cent,  of his income.The Union has no Benevolent Fund.Bank Officers&apos;  Guild.  Have a  membership of 21,000  out  of  a total of about  70,000 in themanagerial and clerical grades in the Banking Industry.   Desire an increasein the salary limit.  Although the  rate of unemployment in  the bankingindustry is low, they have had experience of some unemployment even among those above the present salary  limit, in cases where officers  have been dis-missed through  no fault of their own.  It is almost impossible for anyoneto transfer from one bank to another and extremely difficult for an officer who has lost  employment in  a bank to obtain other  work.National Union of Clerks and Administrative Workers.  Membership numbers between 8,000  and 9,000 but the number  who are outside unemployment insurance by reason  of the present salary limit is not known.  They are  in favour of raising  the  salary limit to   500  a year.   Thepresent  salary limit is unsatisfactory because  large  numbers  of clericalworkers pass  out of  insurance upon promotion,  and  thus after a time,  lose the value  of  the contributions they have paid.   The unemployment  amongsuch workers has increased heavily in recent years, and at the  present  timethe distinction  between manual  and non-manual workers as regards securityof tenure is disappearing.  Axe  in favour of the  same rates of  contributions and benefits  for the higher paid workers.  The  non-manual  worker  whobecomes unemployed is in  a worse position than the manual worker,  since his difficulty  in securing new employment in his former status is  greater;when seeking an appointment with  a potential employer,  is  frequentlytold that  he is  &quot; too  good &quot; for the  post.Sational Federation of  Provident  Associations of Clerhs  and Warehousemen.  A Federation of Friendly Societies and not of Trade  Unions,  representingabout 80,000  individuals.  Probably  about 30 per cent,  are  excluded  fromunemployment insurance by the salary limit.  Voluntary effort  has  failed tomeet the situation and  they are in favour  of an increase in the salary limit to  500, mainly because there is a real need for  insurance among the higher paid classes.  Differential rates of contributions  and benefits are undesirablebecause of the serious administrative difficulties involved.   They  do not thinkthat there is more unemployment among their older members,  but when itdoes occur it is more intractable.National Amalgamated  Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerhs.  Has a membership of about 84,000,  but  cannot  say what proportion are excluded from  insurance by the  present  salary  limit.    Are  in favour ofincreasing the salary limit  to  520 a year.   Unemployment has increased inthe distributive  trades through  trade depression,  and through  formation oftrusts, particularly on  the drapery side.   Through these  movements, manywen earning  over   250 a year have been  thrown out of  employment;  theyare frequently without resources and much  distress has resulted.  The classes in question included  buyers, shopwalkers, departmental managers and branchmanagers.  The process of rationalisation  is continuing  in the distributive
trades.   There has been a  demand for many years for the raising of the salary limit.  There  should be  no differential  rates  of  contributions  and benefits for those  with higher  salaries.  There is a good deal of fluctuationin salaries round the   250 limit, largely due to remuneration by commissionparticularly in the clothing trade.Printing and Kindred Trades  Federation.  Represents  over 170,000 members  in the printing industry, of  whombetween 7,000 and 8,000 are non-manual workers outside the present scopeof unemployment  insurance.   Are in  favour of raising the salary  limit toat least  500 a year, which would bring most of their members into insur-ance.   Anomalies  result from the present  salary limit and from  the dis-tinction between  manual  and  non-manual work.    The  introduction  ofmachinery has removed much of the purely manual part of  their labour and made the distinction  between manual and non-manual more obscure.  Lithoartists and process workers are deemed to be non-manual workers, although a few workers such  as tint-layers and line-etchers  are held to be manual workers.  In the Typographical Society, members may sometimes be employed as manual workers and sometimes as non-manual workers.   The press tele-graphist is held to be a  non-manual  worker while  the linotype-operator  isa manual worker,  but both  are engaged on work necessitating the operatingof a  key board.   A limit of   500 a;  year, by  including  all their memberswithin the scheme, would remove the existing anomalies.  The  developmentof high  speed machinery,  and other  developments,  have made employmentless secure.British Actors Equity Association.  Membership over 5,000.  Are  in favour  of increasing the salary limit to 500 a  year.   They  have  no provision at  present for  assisting membersduring unemployment.  Their position is anomalous because members  maybe employed for a number  of  weeks at a rate of pay  which excludes them from insurance, and  have other  periods at a rate of pay which makes theminsurable.  Frequently the number of  contributions paid  is insufficient to qualify for benefit. In many other cases where the weekly rate of pay excludesartistes  from insurance, the total earnings during  the year are well below 250.  An increase in the salary limit would  remove such anomalies to aVery  great degree.Theatrical Artists Film Society.   In favour  of raising the  remuneration limit to  500 per  annum owing tothe casual and extremely precarious nature of their employment.Musicians&apos; Union.  Have membership of 7,145 of  whom about 2,600 are in what is known as permanent employment.   Are  in favour of raising the salary limit to  500a  year.  At  present  a large proportion of the members  are excluded frominsurance  because it  has been  ruled that normal attendance at the place ofentertainment, for 36 hours or more weekly, constitutes whole time employ-ment, and where  employment is for  less than  whole time  the musician  is excluded from insurance if his  remuneration is at the rate of more than2s. 8d.  per hour.  This means  that many members are excluded from insur-ance  although their total earnings in the year  are  well below   250.   Eventhe  so-called  permanent  employees are unemployed from  two to  fourteenweeks in the year. The. raising  of the salary limit is the only way of removing the existing  anomalies.Variety Artistes Federation. .  Have 1,500 members of whom  only about 15 per cent, are employees under contract of service.  Are in favour of  voluntary insurance against unemploy-ment above  the present salary limit, or  would prefer that those  already
 insured should be allowed to continue insurance when  they reach the salary limit. National Association of Theatrical Employees.  Have membership  of about 9,000  including  master carpenters, property masters and chief electricians who are heads  of  departments.   They have been held to be non-manual workers although there is an  increasing tendency for them to do manual work.   Are in favour of increasing the salary limit. Almost all are insured earlier in their careers and  pass  out of insurance upon promotion  to be  a head of department.   Although  their rate of re- muneration is over  250 a year, they actually earn less than that  amount in the  whole year.  Employment in the theatres is tending  to become casual, and in very  few theatres  are  the  workers  attached, to  the  theatre  and employed whether it is  open or closed. Miss Eleanor Pathbone, M.P.  Issued questionnaire to graduate voters of  the  eight combined English Universities to ascertain the extent of unemployment  among graduates, and their view  on the raising of the  salary limit.    84 per  cent, of the replies favoured an  increase in the salary limit,  44 per cent, preferring  no limit. A rate of unemployment of  6-5 per cent,  was disclosed.  Of those who had had some period of  unemployment since April, 1931,  nearly two-thirds had graduated  in  the years 1930 to  1933. British Federation of University  Women,  Limited.  The  membership of the Federation is 3,630 and includes graduates of all the British Universities and representatives  of a variety  of professions  of whom teachers account for the largest single group.   A questionnaire was sent to every member  of the  Federation  in order  to  elicit opinion  on the question of the extension of unemployment  insurance.   Seventy-two per cent. of those who  returned replies were in favour  of the  raising  of the salary limit, of whom about half were in favour of higher contributions and benefits than provided for in the present scheme.  Opinion was roughly evenly divided between having a maximum of  500  and  no limit.. London Mead Teachers Association.  Members  would  be  excluded  from  unemployment  . insurance by other provisions of the Act. Association of Head-Mistresses of Mecognised Private Schools. -  The  existing benefit  provided  by unemployment  insurance would  be un-suitable.     The majority  of teachers  are opposed   to any  extension of insurance although a number are known to  be out of employment.National Association of Schoolmasters.  Unemployment insurance is unnecessary  for the teaching  profession.Association of Assistant Masters in Secondary Schools..  Opposed  to the inclusion&apos; of teachers in the  scheme of  UnemploymentInsurance.National Union of Teachers.            ... \;  &apos;-  Represents approximately  150,000 teachers  in elementary, secondary  andtechnical schools of England  and  &quot;Wales.   With the  exception of Slupplemen-taTy teachers who are  not represented  by  the Union  and  of some teachersengaged  in  non-grant-aided  schools or  institutions, very few of whom are
 represented  by the  Union, teachers are excepted from  compulsory unem- ployment insurance.  Statistics are not available as to the number of teachers in non-grant-aided schools who would be brought  within the scope of Unem- ployment Insurance  if the present  salary limit  were raised, nor as to the extent of unemployment  among such teachers.  The Union  does not desire the  extension  of compulsory unemployment insurance to teachers whom it represents. National Union of Women Teachers.  Teachers  are in  a  different position from that  of the non-manual worker in general.   In the first  case unemployment does not exist to  any degree except among  newly qualified teachers, who would not, if the present con- ditions  of  insurance  obtain,  become  eligible  for unemployment  benefit since they would  not have paid any contributions  to the fund.   It is only in exceptional eases  that  teachers in State schools  are  dismissed after they have once secured an appointment.   Further, the National Union of Women Teachers holds that, if the long  advocated reforms of raising  the school- leaving  age and reducing the size  of  classes became  effective,  there  need be  no unemployment question among  teachers.    They  are,  therefore,  of the  opinion  that,  so far as the teaching  service is concerned, the difficulty of unemployment can better be met by-       (a) controlling the output of the training colleges,  and       (6) reforming  the education system, rather than by attempting to secure the inclusion  of teachers in an uuem- ployment insurance scheme. London  Teachers  Association.  Represents approximately 15,000 teachers in Elementary, Secondary and Technical Schools  and Training Colleges in the area of the  London Educa- tion Authority.   The membership does not include supplementary teachers, nor, as a rule, teachers working in non-grant-aided schools  or institutions, The majority of the  members are already excepted  from  compulsory unem- ployment insurance and the Association is not in favour of  the extension of insurance to the teachers  whom it represents. Association of  Teachers  in Technical Institutions.  The majority of technical  teachers  come  within the  provisions  of  tie Teachers (Superannuation) Act of 1925, and are therefore excepted from Un- employment  Insurance,  irrespective of the salary limit.  In  other cases the Association  would  approve the principle of  the  extension of  compulsory Unemployment  Insurance. London  Supply Teachers Association.  In  favour of increasing the salary limit for  unemployment  insurance to  500 a year. Except for voluntary Benevolent Associations, no provision exists  for assisting unemployed teachers.

               EMPLOYMENT BY WAY OP MANUAL  LABOUR.                   Note by the Ministry of Labour. At their meeting  on 25th October last the Committee asked for informa-tion  as to the  line  of  demarcation for  unemployment  insurance purposesbetween manual and non-manual labour.  The present  note has been  pre-pared in response to that request. It  is  thought  that the best way of answering the Committee&apos;s question isto refer first of  all to certain instructions which have been  drawn  up  for the guidance of those who have to come to conclusions on the  matter; to followthese with summaries of important judgments given in  the High  Court and decisions under  the Act; and  to  end  with a  discussion  of  the  treatment which is, in fact, given to certain border-line and difficult cases. I.  The following  extracts from  the  Instructions  to Inspectors  of theMinistry of Health  (who, the Committee will be aware,  act for the Ministryof Labour  in  connection with questions  of insurability)  set out the  general principles to be  borne in mind:    (i) Manual labour is a question of fact and therefore has to be deter-  mined  in  relation to the actual conditions of employment, and not  with  reference to  the general description of  the  occupation in  which an  individual is engaged.    (ii) The real   and substantial character of  the   employment  is the  determining factor, and not any subsidiary  and  incidental  conditions  which may be attached to it.    (iii)  &quot;Where the employment  is essentially for the exercise of crafts-  manship,  however skilled, it is manual labour.   As the  Courts no longer  recognise any distinction  between manual  labour and  manual work,  it  is immaterial whether the work is arduous or light.   On the other hand,  if  supervision,  direction,  display  of taste  and  imagination,  or the  exercise of  any  special mental  or artistic faculty or the application of  scientific  knowledge (as distinguished  from  manual  dexterity)  is the  primary quality of  the employment,  the employment  is not  deemed to  be by way of manual labour, although a  certain amount of manual work  may be involved.    (iv)  The amount of manual labour as measured by time is important  but is  not  by  itself  a conclusive test.   A person may be employed  essentially for  the  performance of manual labour  when the occasion   arises,  although  in  practice only  a  small part of his time may be  occupied  in  active effort.  The  operators  of  modern machines,  as  well   as  certain  overlookers  in  the   textile  industry,  are  in this position.   Conversely,   there  are employments  in which manual labour  is  con-   tinuously exercised,  but where  it  is joined with,  and  subordinate to,   essential  qualifications of artistic skill and initiative. II. These principles are based on  decisions of the High Court, examples ofwhich are  given below.                        Dairyman&apos;s Foreman. In the case of the  employment of a dairyman&apos;s foreman or branch managerit was  held that, although the employee  might perform  manual labour, thequestion was whether that was the real substantial employment for which he
was engaged or whether it was incidental or accessory to  it.   Even if assist-ing to lift churns was incidental to the employment,  such  labour  was notthe labour for which  the employee was  substantially engaged and  he wastherefore, not employed by way  of manual labour.                        Foreman Tailor&apos;s  Cutter.  Similarly it was  held in  the case of a  foreman  tailor&apos;s cutter  that,although the actual labour of cutting  out cloth might be manual labour, the employee in question really occupied the  position of a manager of a  businessdepartment.   His duties were, therefore, substantially duties not involvingmanual labour.                         Chief Dental  Mechanic.  Both of the above decisions were given under the National Insurance Actin 1912.  In a more recent case the Minister of Health decided that a chiefdental mechanic was employed by way of manual labour and his decision wasupheld on appeal by the dentist to the High Court.  In the course  of his judgment Mr. Justice Roche  said that    &quot; the whole tendency of  modern industry is to  substitute machines for    brawn, and  to make operations which were formerly attended by a high    degree of exertion operations which are still manual and may  involve a    high degree of skill and dexterity, but make them altogether cease to    in the ordinary sense  of  the word  laborious.  Now,  I am prepared to    hold that .... there is  no  distinction  at all between labour  and    work . ... I hold that  for the purposes  of  the present Act a person    may be employed by way of manual labour although no  high  degree of    exertion may be involved ....  The test is; what was substantially the    nature of the employment;  was it employment for .a man&apos;s  head and    skill, or was it employment for the work of his hands? &quot;Acrobat in Touring Hevue.  Subsequently a case came before the same judge on an appeal against the jdecision  of the Minister  that  an acrobat was  employed  by way  of  manual labour.   The &quot; turn &quot; of  the acrobat and his partner consisted  of gymnasticmovements (without the use of apparatus) hand to hand balancing, tumbling,etc.   Mr. Justice  Roche  allowed the  appeal.   He stated that  the partners&quot; had to do many  things which involved both physical dexterity and physicalexertion, but then so do dancers .... The test is whether the  woTk witlthe hands is the essence of the work, or whether there is some other power or quality in the  essential matter.  Here  Mr......................was  in  essencea comedian and a public performer  and not a workman.&quot;                         Professional Footballers.  A formal decision was  given in 1912 to the effect that professional foot-bailers are employed by way of manual labour.   Following the decision inthe High Court in regard  to  the acrobat it  was decided to take an  early opportunity to refer a suitable case of  employment as a footballer to theHigh Court.   The judge decided that professional footballers (or cricketers)are not engaged  in manual work; they  &quot; are engaged as exponents . .for exhibition purposes and to amuse and entertain other people at playinga game &quot;.
m                          .minister&apos;s Decisions..   -            ,y&apos;  .  --&quot;Apart ,&apos;from decisions in &apos;.the High; Court there  have been., a number  of decisions under the Health.&apos;and (or nheft(ploymtent Insurance.;Aqt.s. on thequestion  of employment by way  of manual labour, of which  the  followingale examples :    :   &apos;     7.      Employments by way of manual labour.   &apos;        &quot; ;&apos; -   Foreman (with substantial manual;duties).   Tackier or  Loom-Jobber in textile weaving mill. .                     .

Chauffeur (who also cleans car and effects small repairs).   Cook at  hotel.               :    -: - -              Employments not by way of manual labour.   Foreman  or Manager  (mainly engaged  in  supervision  or  management).   Printer&apos;s reader.   lithographic  Artist.   Watch  tester and adjuster. ..   Wireless  telegraph  operator.   Piano Tuner.   Chef-de-Cuisine  (who supervises the kitchen  staff).   Trained sick  nurse.                   III. Borderline and  difficult cases.  It is sometimes possible in certain industries to determine the position under the Insurance Acts of whole classes of employment  and thus to avoiddetailed examination of particular cases.   In the printing trades, composi-tors, linotype  and monotype operators,  eleetrotypers, line etchers, printerson metal, etc., are accepted as manual, and overseers or other persons  mainlyengaged in supervision  or management,  readers, copyholders, revisers, iitho-graphic and process  artists, process engravers,. colour and half tone etchers,etc., are treated as non-manual. In the case of a process operator in an ordi-nary commercial firm of process engravers the employment is regarded as non-manual, but this might not be the case where  the operator is employed bya firm,  e.g., a  newspaper office which does not  primarily carry on the busi-ness of process  engravers.  It  is  because of the varying duties of different persons employed  in thesame nominal category  of employment that it  is not  possible to deal withall employments  in such a comprehensive manner.    In certain industries itmight be possible to make broad  sub-divisions of  a class, but .a. definiteruling cannot be given in any particular case without investigation as to theactual conditions of employment  unless  the matter  can  be  determined  as above or the conditions of employment are uniform as,  for example,  in thecase of  professional footballers.  The employment of managers of butchers&apos; shops is  regarded as manualwhere the duties mainly consist in  the cutting  up,  including rough cutting,of meat and serving it to customers and  do not  involve buying or book-keeping to any substantial extent.    If, however,  the substantial  characterof the employment consists in supervising the work of assistants,  managingthe  business,  buying,  clerical  work  and  exercising qualities  of   salesman-ship, the employment is regarded  as non-manual.  The general position with regard to shop assistants is  that, although their work usually involves a certain  amount  of manual  labour, their substantial
duty is the  selling  of  goods to customers,  which  is non-manual.   Wherehowever,  in addition  to the  ordinary  duties of  salesmanship,  there arefurther duties involving a  considerable  amount of manual  labour, it maybe  proper to  take  the  view that the  employment is by way of manual labour.                    &quot;       .......&apos;  &apos;     &apos;  Warehousemen  are  in a  somewhat  similar position.    They  are  oftenemployed mainly  as clerks or salesmen, but,  where they are required to handle heavy goods to  a substantial - extent,  careful  investigation is  neces-sary before an opinion can be  expressed one way or the other.  Mercantile Marine:  Questions of employment  by way of manual labour in the mercantile marine constitute a large and  separate  category of  prob-lems, particularly as regards engineering officers.  Navigating officers of  all  grades as a  class  aTe non-manually employed as their  duties  are  substantially  those  of navigation  and  supervision,  andno serious question  arises save in  vessels of quite small size, where no  boat-swain  is employed.  In the  case of engineering officers, the duties vary on different  classes ofvessels, and the line of demarcation between grades is not easy to determine,Certain working rules, based on decisions and High Court judgments  whichhave been  given  in  typical cases, have  had to  be  devised for general guidance.  Overlookers  in the textile trade are  normally called upon to repair andadjust machinery at any time during  their  duties and may generally beregarded  as  employed by way of manual labour, but sometimes their dutiesare almost wholly supervisory and therefore non-manual.  Following  a  formal decision of the Minister of Health that a postman is employed by way of manual labour, it is  held that messengers in Governmentdepartments and  bank messengers engaged  in the normal duties of that employment  are employed by way  of manual labour.  The position of persons working on electrical apparatus, e.g., in connec-tion with  sound apparatus for &quot; talking-films &quot;  in cinemas  presents  some difficulty.    The employment has  been  regarded as non-manual  in  a case where  the duties were essentially those of inspection and supervision, with asmall amount  of special adjustment  and demonstration.  Other  examples  could  be  given, but frequently it is only  possible togive a general indication of the position.  Sometimes the rate of  remunera-tion gives  an  indication of the  proper treatment.    Trainers  employedby. football  clubs  come  within this  class.    The higher  class of trainershave professional  qualifications or training as masseurs and  as  a general rule only trainers earning less than   250  a  year are insurable, the dutiesof those earning more than  that  amount being  otherwise than by way ofmanual labour.Ministry of Labour.(3/36) (S5301r-11) Wt. 1031-1298 BOO  4/36 P.St. Q. 335                                                  S.O.
