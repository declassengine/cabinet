This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.      1.   I must ask the Cabinet to give prompt considerationto the questions which have been brought to a head by theattempted Fascist demonstration in the East End of london on Sunday 4th October and the public comment which this andcognate matters have aroused.   These questions are certain to be raised as soon as Parliament meets and, if legislation is to be introduced, it certainly ought to be announced in theKing&apos;s Speech.      2 .   My own provisional view is that legislation of some sort will be needed, and that it will be very difficult to meetthe sustained demand for it by merely &quot;standing pat&quot;.So far as the East End of London is concerned, the Fascistpttacks on the Jews have aroused intense anxiety, in spiteof the vigorous action of the Police and a series of prosecutions and convictions for &quot;insulting words calculated to lead to a breach of the peace&quot; .   A number of East EndMayors have been visiting the Home Office in deputation, and east End Members, like Mr. Herbert Morrison, are loud inprotest .   And there cannot be the least doubt that the Fascistcampaign, which goes on nightly, is stimulating the CommunistMovement so that the danger of serious clashes is growing.I have information from Government supporters in East LondonSECRET.P. 261  (36)CABINET.PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC ORDER .Memorandum by the Home Secretary .
253that the Jewish element is tending to throw itself into the arms of the Opposition, and the strain on the MetropolitanPolice (large numbers of whom Sunday after Sunday have to dispense with their customary leave) is deplorable.   Theone satisfactory feature in the situation is that the Londonpoliceman maintains his invariable steadiness and impartialitysnd a deputation of leading Jews which saw me the other daywent out of their way to testify, and have since repeatedpublicly, that allegations of bias against the  Force were quite unfounded.   The problem moreover is not confined to east London.   There have been ugly incidents in Leeds andother provincial towns, and the Manchester Corporation is coming in deputation to see me .      3-   I suggest that the best course, after a preliminary discussion in Cabinet, would be to appoint asmall Ministerial Committee to consider whether anylegislative proposal should be put forward by the Government,and if so,  what format should take-   The framing of any legislation is a very difficult matter,  both from the politicaland the legal point of view,  and I think the Law officers should be asked to join the Committee.      4-   I have of course given a good deal of thought tothe subject and,  without anticipating the views which such aCommittee might form,  I am disposed to  advance  the followingpropositions:-     (a)  The new legislation  should not  confer  any additional         powers upon the Home  Secretary  as such.   For one
2ei    thing,  he is only responsible for the Police in the    Metropolitan area -    Moreover express statutory    powers  placed in the  hands of the Home Secretary    would facilitate parliamentary challenge on every    occasion and if a Government of a strong party    complexion came into  office hereafter such powers    might be used in partisan fashion.   As things are,    the Home Secretary  is constitutionally responsible    for the Metropolitan  Police, and has the duty of                                                        -    meeting criticism directed against them in Parliament.    But he  does not give  the  Police detailed directions:    he only consults with the Commissioner in cases of    exceptional importance .    The Emergency Regulations    under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, are quite a    different matter .  Regulation No- 22 of the    Emergency Regulations made during the General Strike    empowered a Chief Officer of Police,  when specially    authorized by the Secretary of State, to make an    order prohibiting the holding of a meeting or    procession where there was reason to fear a breach    of the  peace or the promotion of disaffection -    What is wanted,  however,  in the present connexion    is not  an Emergency Regulation but a strengthening of    the ordinary law of the land.(b)  Any new legislation should not be directed against a    particular organisation as such.  It must be so    framed  as to apply  generally whenever the conditions    named are fulfilled.   In 1934 the Cabinet had before
P 0 e)    it a proposal (in C.P.  189(34)) to make it an offence    for any person,  in pursuit of a political object to    form any body of persons into an organisation of    military character, by drill,  or by the use of    uniforms, or by  the use of other military methods.    A Bill in this form would have the advantage of    striking at the  leaders of any such movement, though    no doubt it could be  so framed as to cover the    followers too .(c)  As regards uniforms&apos;,  while I  doubt very much whether    uniforms are the kernel of the mischief*  there is no    doubt at all that the resentment against  the wearing    of uniforms by the Fascists is intense.   The    practice is felt to be  repugnant to British ideas    and to suggest the assumption of authority by a    &quot;private army&quot; .    People are  very much alive to the    fact that in Germany  the wearing of black or brown    uniforms led to  the overthrow of popular  liberties    and Sir Oswald Mosley makes no secret of  his desire    to follow the German  and Italian examples.   His    followers look much &quot;smarter&quot; in uniform  than they ever    would do in ordinary  clothes, and this adds to his    power of appeal  with  a  section of the public.   Men    in uniform have  less  difficulty in coming to one    another&apos;s aid as comrades in  the event of a melee.    I believe it is  the general view of police authorities    that the wearing of such uniforms is provocative and    certainly it is  one of  the principal matters seized
296    upon for denunciation by the  anti-Fascists.(d)  There remains  the  question of processions.   If    legislation against uniforms  was  decided upon,  I    think it would be  necessary to consider some    legislation about  processions also ,    Otherwise the    proposals might have the air  of being directed  against    the  Fascists only,  while the  rowdyism and disorder    created  by the political opponents of Fascism remain    untouched.  Even  if uniforms were banned, a    procession of  un-uniformed Fascists in the East End    of London would call out into the streets all the    Jews and anti-Fascists,  and the Police would have the    same difficulties  to face as  those with which they    are  now  confronted .   The new factors in the    situation are  on the one hand the disquiet caused by    events on the  Continent  and the hysterical fear that    an anti-Jew agitation might gain  the- mastery in this    country,, and on the other hand the modern facilities    for  the  speedy concentration  of large crowds in an    urban area and. modern devices, for attracting large    masses of people: Who would not attend meetings  &quot;-r    demcn.strati.ons unless they were; assured of being able    to hear-  the: speakers: by  the help  of amplifiers .    It is surely obvious that o-ur streets are- not    designed for monster demonstrations  and couhter-    demonst rat ions of  the kind, we how witness.   On the    other hand streets and open places are necessarily    the  meeting ground for the. poor- and  a very great
 1        deal of latitude would have to &quot;be allowed in all         suitable oases .   It seems to me that what needs to         he considered is legislation which would empower         specifically Chief Officers of Police to prohibit         in advance processions and demonstrations in the         streets if satisfied that they are calculated to         lead to disorder and to provide - what the law does         not do at present - that any persons wh*D organize         or take part in a procession or demonstration in         defiance of such a prohibition shall be guilty of         an offence .   But a proposal of this sort would         need to he very carefully considered from every         point if view.                                   3 . S .12 .10 .36
