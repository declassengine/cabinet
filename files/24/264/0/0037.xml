THE CABINETLOCATION OF THE ROYAL ORDNANCE CORDITE       FACTORY AT BISHOPTON OR GRETNA      MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR WAR     1. At the  28th Meeting of the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee     119of the Committee of: Imperial Defence, held on  22nd  October,  1936, the  question   Scottishwhether  Gretna should be substituted for Bishopton as the site for a Cordite Factory     444was  discussed with  more particular reference  to  the  political  issues involved, sinceGretna is not in a Scottish Special Area, whereas Bishopton is.     The Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee approved  the substitution of Gretna  for Bishopton, but  asked that I  should  circulate a  paper to the Cabinetelaborating in greater detail the reasons for  the preference for Gretna.   The defence policy and Requirements Sub-Committee also asked that the minutes and conclusionsof the Defence Policy and  Requirements Sub-Committee  on this  subject should  besubmitted  to  the Cabinet ; they  are accordingly printed as  an  Appendix to thismemorandum.     2. The Hacking Committee, who were asked to advise as to a suitable locality ina safer area for the  cordite manufacture  now carried out at  Waltham, recommendedeither Queensferry or Gretna, where the former war-time cordite  factory  existed.  TheCabinet at their Meeting* on 31st July, 1935, when considering this Committee&apos;s Report,did not approve  either of these  sites, but referred the question to a new Committee,the Robinson Committee.   That Committee,  which  considered a site for  a fillingfactory as well as for a cordite factory, said,&quot; We have thought  that we should best meetthe needs of the situation  by endeavouring to  see whether a site of this kind, in other respects suitable, could not also be found in a Special Area, and we have, with this object,had the Special Areas in Scotland carefully examined  . .  . .&quot;  After an examinationof those  Special Areas, the  only site of the size needed, viz., 2,000 acres, which couldbe found was that at  Bishopton  near  Glasgow, and, after such consideration  of  thefacilities  and safety as they could give  within the limited time available, they recom-mended the Bishopton site.  No  consideration  was given by the Committee  to  therelative advantages  of Bishopton  and Gretna.  The Cabinet at their  Meeting^ on 8th  April,  1936, authorized  the  purchase of the  land at Bishopton.   Treasuryauthority was obtained for the purchase of 2,000 acres at Bishopton  at  an estimatedcost of  110,000.   The land has not yet been purchased.     3. In the  course  of the preliminary investigations  which  followed, it  came  to notice that the local water supply on which the Robinson Committee had  relied, woiddnot be available except at prohibitive  expense.   A  cordite factory  needs a veryconsiderable quantity of good water for technical purposes, amounting  for a factorywith an output of 500 tons a week (which was the size contemplated by  the RobinsonCommittee) to about 10,000,000 gallons a day.   The War Office then considered  thepossibility of obtaining a water supply for Bishopton  from the  Glasgow Corporationwater system at Loch Katrine, and  in view of the serious nature of the  problem they felt obliged to consider the relative  advantages of Gretna and Bishopton  as  sites for  acordite factory.     4. The site of the war-time factory on  the  Sol way  Firth  near  Gretna  is about miles from Carlisle and  about 70 miles from  Glasgow.   The land was originallylightly farmed arable and pasture land, but to-day it is derelict and used for pasture.The factory wras designed for 1,000 tons  a week and produced about 800 tons a week in 1917  :  it then  employed  nearly  20,000 operators,  70 per cent,  being women.COPY no 5* CP. 145 (35) : Cabinet Meeting 41 (35).t CP. 107 (36) : Cabinet Meeting 28 (36).
A water supply of close on  10,000,000 gallons a day was eventually drawn from theRiver Esk.  The factory was abandoned  in  1921.  The site  at  Bishopton is about12 miles from Glasgow on agricultural land with some plantations of trees borderingthe main railway line from Glasgow to Greenock.     5.  From  the point of view  of the technical  supply of cordite in the presentsituation the  two most important  factors which  should be taken  into account incomparing  Gretna  and Bishopton are  (i) the water supply and (ii) the rapidity of construction.     (i)  The  water supply  to Bishopton  from Loch Katrine would be adequate in quantity ; it would, however, require a  pipe  line 15 miles long which would have topass under the River  Clyde to convey  it to Bishopton.   This pipe line Avould take along  time  to  construct and  would  be vulnerable both  to attack from aircraft and tosabotage.  The  quality of  the water is  such  that  it would need  chemical treatment and constant supervision of that treatment.  The capital cost of  the  pipe line  scheme would be about   380,000, but it is understood that the -Glasgow Corporation mightbear part of the cost on a sliding  scale, thus reducing the cost to the Government toperhaps  200,000 on a guarantee  being given that a minimum of  2,000,000 gallons aday would be purchased from the Corporation.  This minimum demand would not, how-ever, be reached under ordinary peace conditions.  Waltham with its present abnormaloutput uses under 1,000,000 gallons a day.   The  water  obtained from  the  glasgow corporation would involve an annual recurring  charge of 5Jci. a thousand gallons inaddition to the cost of treatment.     At Gretna adequate water exists in the River  Esk of a quality that is satisfactoryfor all purposes, and, apart from capital expenses, the only cost involved in obtainingit would be that of pumping.   The  capital expenditure  on water supply at Gretna isestimated to be  about  200,000.   At Gretna  there is  no recurring charge for  thewater beyond  pumping, since the water from  the Esk is free and requires no treatment,whereas that from Loch Katrine at Bishopton will  cost o^d. a thousand gallons.     (ii) It is estimated that the  time taken in the construction  of  Gretna would  bre from  6 to 8 months less than that for the  corresponding work at  Bishopton.  the saving of time  results  from the existence of certain works of the  former factory atGretna, in particular, buildings, earth mounds, levelled roads for railways and sidings,and the avoidance of water supply difficulties.     6.  While the important factors at the moment are the two foregoing matters, thereis the question of cost of construction.   It  is expected  that the 2,000  acres of  land required for the proposed cordite factory, whether at Bishopton or Gretna, will cost about 60,000 less at Gretna than at Bishopton (where the site  is estimated to cost  110,000)and that the expense  of construction at  Gretna will also be at least  150,000 lessowing to existing works, etc. ; the actual amount will depend on the design of factoryeventually adopted.     It  is now proposed to erect  a factory  of only 250 tons capacity in peace,  butcapable of expansion to 500  tons in war.   The comparisons above are made on thebasis that the factories at  Bishopton and Gretna are of the same size, and hold goodgenerally for  a  factory of  250 tons, capable of expansion to 500 tons  in war ;  theland and water requirements remain the same if expansion in war is to be provided for.     As regards the cost at Gretna, there is a possibility of the payment of compensationfor considerable  fishing interests in  this lower portion  of the river  ; in peace time,however, the quantity of water that would be withdrawn from it might be so small as not to interfere with fishery  rights.  The effluent would  not be returned  to  the riverbut  be  carried  direct  to the sea  in the  Solway Firth.   (At Waltham the effluent isdischarged into the River Lea where fishing is carried on.)     It would also be  necessary to  close  a small branch railwa3T line on the Gretna site,but the cost of this together with any cost for compensating fishing rights, if any, isexpected to be considerably  less that the saving in construction at  Gretna as comparedwith  Bishopton.     7.  As regards the supply of labour, no shortage was experienced in  the last war when the factory was nearly  double the  size of that  now  proposed, and  with  the improved facilities of  modern transport no difficulty is expected.     8.  I ask my colleagues to agree to the erection of a cordite factory at  Gretnainstead of at Bishopton.                                                                         D. C.

FIFTH PROGRESS  EEPORT BY  THE WAR  OFFICE                                   (Paper No.  D.P.B,  126)     Introducing the Eeport  MR.  DUFF  COOPER  referred  to  the  proposed cordite factory at Bishopton which had a bearing on a  question of siting factories in distressed areas which had been discussed in  connection with  the Admiralty Progress Eeport.  The  latest view  was that it would be  preferable  to construct this factory at Gretna  and  so  effect a sa.ving both in time and money.   Details  of  the case  were  being submitted  to  the Treasury  to-day.   Gretna, however,  unlike Bishopton, was not a distressed area, but as a shortage  of labour in Glasgow had already  been reported, it  did not  appear that  the erection  of  the Bishopton  factory would be  of  any assistance to that  area.     If  the War Office  could have  the approval of the Sub-Committee on the political issues involved in siting a, factory at Bishopton or Gretna,  they could then proceed with the necessary arrangements.     LORD  WEIR considered that politically Bishopton would  be preferable to  Gretna.    On the other hand conditions, including water  supply, at Gretna were  suitable,  and it would be cheaper to erect a factory  there.  In the first place, there would  be a shortage  of the  skilled labour necessary to build  the  factory, but once  the factory had been  constructed unskilled labour in the main would be  required and this should be obtainable at Gretna.  The balance of advantage, therefore, lay with Gretna, both in time and money.    THE CHAIRMAN said that the Scottish Office were  strongly in favour of Bishopton  and that whilst  the Sub-Committee could make  recommendations the decision would lie with the Cabinet.     SIR ARTHUR EOBINSON  said  that  as regards labour  the view was that as  in  the late War the labour for Gretna would  come  from England and not from Scotland.    In the  ensuing discussion it was pointed out that both the running and construction  costs would  be considerably reduced if the factory  were sited at Gretna.   The water supply at  Gretna was much  cheaper, was quite  satisfactory  and,  owing to the  ample supplies it  would be much easier to extend this factory in time of war than to extend a factory at Bishopton.    LORD WEIR was  of opinion that the erection of  an explosives factory was of little  value to a distressed area, as it  would only be worked part time in a period of years until  the necessary stocks  were accumulated, and would then  have to  close down.    THE CHAIRMAN suggested that,  having regard to the fact  that there would be  a saving of six  months  in construction and  also in capital  expenditure.. in  running costs if a factory  were erected at  Gretna,  the  Committee should  approve the selection of the Gretna  site as opposedto Bishopton.    This was agreed to, and it was  considered  that this decision,  together with a copy  of the minute recording the discussion, should be  submitted  to  the  Cabinet.                                        CONCLUSIONS    The Sub-Committee agreed:                            *****                      .    (ii) To support  the War Office recommendation that it would  be preferable to build a Cordite          Factory  at Gretna rather than Bishopton, for  the following reasons:            (a) It would mean  a saving  in time of six to seven months.          (b) It would mean a considerable saving of money both in capital outlay and recurring                expenditure.          (c) The  water supply at  Gretna is suitable, both  in  quality  and quantity;  and an                increased  supply  could  be  obtained  without  difficulty,  if  necessary.     At                Bishopton,  on  the  other hand,  water  is of  unsuitable  quality,  scarce  and                expensive; and there would  be difficulty  in  securing an increased  supply.          (d) The  facilities for factory expansion, which would almost  certainly  be necessary                in war, are greater at Gretna than  at Bishopton.          (e) Although, on the face  of it,  there are advantages  from the point of view  of the                distressed areas in erecting the  factory at Bishopton, rather than Gretna, these                advantages are in fact illusory, since a chemical factory is -not in the long run                a  great asset to any district.   (hi)  That  the Secretary of State for War should circulate a paper to the Cabinet,  elaborating          in greater  detail the reasons for his preference for  Gretna, which are  summarised in          (ii) above; and in addition that the above Minutes and Conclusions should be submitted          to the Cabinet with a  recommendation that they should  approve  the proposals  of the          Secretary of State for  War.(B36/8)  70  10/36  W.O.P.  9996
