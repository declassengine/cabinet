Printed fdr the Cabinet!  September 1936.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.  43CP. 240.CABINET.PALESTINE  SITUATION.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, the attached memo-randum regarding the possibility that,  if martial law is declared in Palestine,General Dill may find it necessary, as a matter of military precaution,  to close the country  temporarily against all entrants of whatever nationality or place of origin.                                                (Initialled)      W. O. G.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,        September 15, 1936.                               MEMORANDUM.                  Suspension of immigration into Palestine.    MY colleagues will  remember that, among the conclusions reached by theCabinet at its meeting of  the  2nd September, was one to the  effect that  &quot;no decision  should  be taken  at  present  regarding the temporary suspension ofpermanent immigration into Palestine.&quot;   A point was raised in conversation byGeneral Dill,  when  he  visited the Colonial Office  prior  to his departure forPalestine, which has a bearing on this question.  General Dill represented that,if and when martial law was established, he might find it necessary and indeedessential,  as a matter of military precaution, to close  the  country temporarilyagainst all entrants of whatever nationality or  place of origin.   We could hardlytake the responsibility of overruling the General on such  a point or of disallowinga measure which he regarded as an obvious  necessity on military grounds.   Butthe step, if taken, would amount in effect to  a temporary suspension of immi-gration, and would to that  extent force the hands of the Cabinet on a matter inregard to which they have deliberately postponed their decision.    I am clear that any such stoppage of immigration would be taken by the Jewsas a political decision designed to conciliate the Arabs, and that it would havemost serious repercussions.    I am not asking for  any Cabinet decision at this stage.  I merely wish mycolleagues to know the position.  But I am obtaining full information from theHigh  Commissioner and I attach a copy of an air mail despatch which I have sentto him to-day.

APPENDIX.         &apos;                        PALESTINE.      ,,         -   .  / \ (Secret.)  ......  ..                              Colonial Office, Downing Street, Sir,                                              September 15.  193(5;     I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt  of  your  secret telegram No. 715 of the 11th September in which you commented on the possibility of the introduction of martial law in Palestine resulting in a temporary interruption of immigration.     2.   As the question of a temporary suspension of immigration may in any case again come under review by His Majesty&apos;s Government in  the near future when order has been restored, if it is not first raised in connection  with military measures for  restoring order, I  should be grateful if,  after you have consulted with General  Dill, I could be furnished with material to facilitate consideration of the question and to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government,  in the event of their deciding upon some suspension,  to defend  their position effectively against  the very strong attacks which may be expected to be made  both in  Parliament and elsewhere.     3.   It will be convenient if you will deal separately with      (a) The arguments in favour of a temporary suspension to  be brought into           force after  the restoration of order and continued until decisions have           been taken  on the report of the Royal Commission; and     (b) The question whether, and if so to  what extent, it  may be  necessary  for     .  .    military reasons  to suspend immigration as  one of  the  measures           necessary for the  restoration of order.     4.  As regards (a), there is the general consideration that, as the present method  of  regulating  immigration  on  the principle  of  economic absorptive capacity will  be one of the most important matters under  review  by  the Royal Commission, it could be argued that the status quo should,  so far as possible, be preserved from the time when the Commission starts its deliberations  until the time that His  Majesty&apos;s Government reach their decisions upon its  report.     5.  There is also  the question whether, in view of the expectations which appear to be entertained in some  Arab quarters that, at any rate  some time after order has been restored, immigration will be suspended, an adverse decision on this point might not lead to further serious difficulties with the Arabs,  and even possibly the boycott of  the Commission.     6.  It will be  useful to me to know whether the effects of continued disorderand  the possible result of intenser military activities to quell it are such as tomake a temporary suspension desirable from the  administrative point of view.On the other hand, the argument  will doubtless  be put forward that an interruption-tion in the flow  of immigration, with its concomitant  flow  of  capital  into palestine,  would  have far-reaching and  disastrous  effects  upon  the Jewisheconomic fabric in Palestine, which would react unfavourably upon Governmentrevenues and possibly lead to a demand for relief measures on a large scale.    7.  In your semi-official secret letter of the 31st July to Sir Cosmo Parkinsonand in the memorandum which it enclosed, the administrative implications of a suspension of immigration are examined in detail.  The following points emerge from that&apos; examination :      (1)  All immigrants must have consular visas on their passports  to enable          . them to enter Palestine.   .    (2)  Certificates issued under  the Labour Schedule for the period ending the-           30th September are valid  up to  that date, by which  lime they must          each have a consular visa.  &apos;:  (3)  Consular visas, if granted before the end of September, are  valid for    -    -   three months from the date upon which they are given.  .
    (4) Jewish immigration seeks to avoid July, August and the early part of           September, and the maximum rate of immigration is normally reached           in October and November.    (5) If the order  for suspension does  not take effect before the 1st October,           1936,  it is estimated that the total  number of immigrants whose           certificates and visas have been granted  before  that date, arriving           from the 1st October to the end of the year, in all categories, may be           about 12,000.                         &apos;                            &quot;    (6) Jewish immigration for the month of August amounted to nearly 3,000,           and,  as stated  in  your  telegram  No.  715,  the Commissioner  of           Migration does not expect any decline in its amount for the month of           September.    (7) As Jewish immigration for the period October-December inclusive, 1935,           amounted  to  rather more than  14,000,  it would  appear  that  the           estimate of 12,000  for  October-December 1936, referred  to at (5)           above, if  no new authorities  for immigration  are  given  after  the           30th September, can only be explained by the assumption of  something           like a three months&apos;  &quot;time lag&quot;  in the use  of such immigration           certificates as have been issued, combined  with  the occurrence of the           peak period of immigration in October and November.   Nevertheless,           the estimate of 12,000 in present circumstances would  appear to be           somewhat  surprisingly high, and I should be glad of some further           explanation on this  point.    8.  (&amp;) To turn now to  possible military reasons for suspension of immigra-tion during the  period  of   the  suppression of  disorders,  General Dill, as  Iinformed you in my tplegram No. 479 of the 10th September, has mentioned thepossibility that,  if and when  martial  law were established, he  might find itnecessary, and indeed essential, as a matter  of military precaution to close thefrontier temporarily  against all entrants of whatever nationality or place of origin.  I presume that in saying this he had in mind the closing of sea frontiersas well as land frontiers,  and that, among others, there might be the  following reasons for wishing to adopt this measure  :      (1) To prevent smuggling of arms, ammunition and money;    (2) To prevent the entry of armed bands, mainly by the land  frontiers, and           specially dangerous or enterprising individuals,  whether  Syrian or           Arab leaders of revolt or Communists, who might come in by the sea           frontiers as well  as  overland.It is not clear, however, how far it would be necessary, with such aims as these in view, to prevent the landing of  passengers  from ships  coming from europe and other distant countries  with ordinary travellers  and  immigrants, most ofwhom would be  Jews. If, however, a complete embargo upon all entrants into palestine were considered necessary,  it seems  possible  that General Dill might be influenced  by  considerations  such   as  the difficulty,  while  active  militaryoperations are  in progress,  of  accommodating immigrants on arrival and  of sending them on  to their  destinations, especially in  agricultural colonies.   Youwill no doubt  furnish me with  your views on  this point after discussion withGeneral Dill, and in this connection I shall be glad of information  as to  thepresent position  with  regard to the accommodation of immigrants who  have beenentering Palestine since the  outbreak of disorder in April last.  I presume thatTel Aviv is already experiencing a certain amount of congestion on account of jewish refugees from Jaffa  and from exposed outlying settlements.   Possibly,also, the number of Jewish refugees from  various parts of Jerusalem where they felt themselves exposed to special danger may have  created an administrativeproblem elsewhere.  There  is  also the question whether  it would not be undesirable to add at the present time  to  the  population  of  Jewish agricultural colonies,especially with the winter  coming on and the probability of bad weather  impedingthe means of communication and of obtaining  assistance to repel attacks in  theevent  of renewed outbreaks of disorder.    9.  I should be grateful if you would furnish me as early as possible with your considered views as to whether it is necessary and desirable to impose some
4-  temporary suspension of immigration, and, if too, what-form the suspension should  now  take  and what reasons can. be  given  publicly -for such action........You.....will  realise that any suspension of immigration will meet with strong opposition from  the  Jews, and if,  in spite of this, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  decide that    -suspension is necessary, the  Jews will scrutinise very carefully the reasons^ given  for  such suspension.  You  will  recollect that on previous occasions only the  Labour Schedule was suspended,  and that reasons for the  additional suspension  of other categories on this occasion will have to be given.                                                 I  have, &amp;c.                                        (Signed)      W. ORMSBY  GORE.  High Commissioner      General  Sir Arthur Wauchope,          G.C.M.G., K.C.B.,  C.I.E.,  D.S.O., &amp;c.
