I CIRCULATE herewith the text of a Secret despatch which I have just received from the High Commissioner for Palestine, in which he recommends thatcertain measures should be adopted with a view to reducing the quantity of armsand ammunition at present in the illegal possession of Arabs and Jews.    2.  The Cabinet will be considering  other matters relating  to Palestine onWednesday, the 28th October,  and I am circulating Sir Arthur  Wauchope&apos;sproposals  at once,  in order that a  decision on this important  question  of disarmament may be taken at the same meeting.                                               (Initialled)       W.  0, G.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,           October 22, 1936.APPENDIX.      . Secret Despatch from the High Commissioner for Palestine,  dated            October 16, 1936, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.  (Secret.)  (Reference No. CF/763/36.)         High Commissioner for Palestine,  Sir,                                    .       Jerusalem, October 16, 1936,      I AM sure that you will be as happy as I am that the strike has not only been  called off but is ended, and it is a double satisfaction that this object has been  attained without  any concession on the part  of Government and without  the  application of Martial  Law.  You will remember that the  Arabs originally  included among their demands the complete stoppage, not merely the suspension,&apos;  of immigration, the  prohibition of the transfer of Arab lands to Jews, and  the  establishment of. a national government responsible to a representative Council,  as expressed in the Manifesto of the Arab Higher Committee, which formed part  of Appendix C to my Secret despatch of the 29th April, 1936.      We have refused these demands and have given no promise of suspension of&apos;  immigration or of clemency.  Your statements and my own,  dating back to last  May, to the effect that there would be  no yielding  to violence or to threats of  violence, have been fulfilled to the letter.      It  is true that some Arabs claim that  the intervention  of the Arab Kings  and a cessation of punitive measures constitute a victory for  them.   But leaders  are bound to tell their followers that they have won the war.      2-  Some people complain, naturally &quot;enough, that the disorders might, have  been suppressed months ago, but they forget three important facts.SECRET.CP  272  (36).CABINET.                 Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1936.
                                    S  2 V;;..Eirstlyv-we -have-two .atms.:in-.view,. not  -one./;:You well expressed this so far back as the: 10th June, when you wrote that &quot;to rest the future Government of; Palestine solely upon British force with an embittered, sullen, and in their hearts&quot; rebellious;  Moslem  population  is not a-solution of the problem  consistent  with British tradition.&apos;&apos;... There has been some.embitterment, but far  less than if we had; applied drastic military measures and martial law three or four months ago. I have no doubt that increased bitterness would have been the result if Martial Law, with all the consequences which it entails, had been declared.at a time when the whole Arab community was, openly or secretly, in sympathy  with the rebels.     In  the second  place, it must be remembered that from May  to September there existed a universal feeling among Arabs, including even Arab officials, that the righteousness  of  their  claims  could only be  expressed  by  resistance  to Government.  In my letter of the 12th. February to Mr. Thomas I wrote,  refer ring- to the proposals for a Legislative Council and for the restriction  of land sales, &quot; that the situation will remain quiet  I  cannot promise, but without these two measures I fear I  could promise it  would not.&quot;   Now, thanks  in part to our exercise  of a  certain degree of forbearance, and thanks to the firmness of His Majesty&apos;s  Government, a general feeling has spread among the  Arabs that the strike  and  disorders have led to nothing,  and that the coming  of the Royal Commission should be delayed no longer.  The inevitable results of  Martial  Law, if it had been  applied when the Arab community was visibly united by.the general strike, would  have  involved many innocent people, and  would have gone far to embitter the whole community.  I am now most hopeful that it will not prove necessary  to  declare Martial Law,  but should  it  prove  necessary either  to extinguish all armed resistance or to secure a measure of disarmament and this I regard as a  very remote possibility then  the scope of its action can be limited and the penalties confined, I hope, in present circumstances, to the guilty.     The third point is the extreme difficulty which both the civil and the military authorities  experienced,  in differentiating between the innocent  and the guilty, when the great majority  of the Arab community were in full support of the strike and of their many National Committees, both local and central.     3.  Although I trust that all armed resistance is now at an  end,  I cannot conceal my fear that  if  the decisions  of His  Majesty&apos;s Government,  after consideration of the report of the Royal Commission, do not substantially  meet Arab expectations,  we shall again be faced  with disorders and armed resistance. And I must emphasize that Arab fears of Zionist supremacy are still great, and Arab demands very high.     For this  reason I consider that a measure of disarmament is essential, as I stated in my telegram No. 790 of the 7th October.  I also think that if we made no  effort towards disarmament now, and disturbances were to break out again next year,  we should be open to severe criticism.     4.  In consultation with  my  Executive  Council  I  have  given  careful consideration to the question of disarmament, including the specific points raised in your  telegram No.  583, and I set out in  the succeeding paragraphs  of this despatch my  appreciation of the present position and of the need of disarming the population, the steps which I recommend should be taken to attain this object, and the  probable effects  of such action.  ,    5.  The objects of disarmament would be two.      In&apos;the first place, to effect a very considerable reduction in the number of rifles actually in the hands of those who, as  the events of the last  six months have shown, are most prone to use them against the Government.  I do not attach too much weight  to  the argument that whatever rifles we recover will be replaced from Syria or elsewhere. Some arms undoubtedly will filter in, but I anticipate that the process will be  slow and expensive.      Secondly, if we were to make no effort to collect any arms,  I fear  that such inaction would be wrongly interpreted as readiness to condone the lawlessness and --acts of violence of;the last six&apos;months1 and-would be loudly criticised by all Jews.:&apos; Also the moral effect of  compelling the surrender of at least some arms  by guilty:&apos; villagers,  will&apos; go : far to show that Government will1 not tolerate  defiance of &apos;authority arid is determined to maintain security.            -:-:     &apos;   .   6.  As regards the  date when disarmament should be begun, I propose that it should.be started about the middle  of November.  The  suggested interval is- necessary in order  to allow Arab feelings to subside; and&quot;render the Arabs less recalcitrant to &quot;the&apos; measure;
2*2.       7.  I have no doubt in my mind as to the method to be adopted in disarming   the Arabs.  In general,  disarmament would in the first place be the  duty of the   police :  if they failed, the military would be called upon to support them, that   is to  say,  the military would be acting in  aid of the civil  power.  If resistance   proved obdurate^ it might be necessary to proclaim a form of Martial Law limited   in scope, in which case I should delegate certain limited powers to the General   Officer Commanding, but at present I do not anticipate that this will be necessary.       8.  As  regards the  detailed procedure,  I do not contemplate taking action   against all Arab  villages, nor do I think this necessary.  I propose  that action   should be confined to selected villages&quot; which have been especially turbulent or   aggressive against the  police and the troops,  or which are  reported to be in   possession of a considerable quantity of arms.  I am advised  that it  will be   possible to determine with some accuracy which villages should thus  be selected,   and that police officers have a shrewd idea of the numbers of the rifles concealed   in each.       9.  Disarmament would be proceeded with progressively, action at first being   directed against,  say, half a dozen villages.  Each village would be  assessed as   due to surrender a certain number of rifles (which would be a number definitely   below the number estimated by the police to be concealed), and would  be required   to hand them over within a given time.  A price of, say,  P. 1 or  P. 2 would   be offered for each rifle thus willingly surrendered.  In  the event of the villagers   refusing to hand over their arms by the date specified a  collective fine of perhaps   four times the offered price  for a rifle  would be imposed in respect of each rifle   by which the numbers surrendered fell short of the assessment.   The fine would   be collected,  if necessary, by means of the seizure of movable property, cattle and   grain.       The Arabs understand  and are accustomed  to a measure of this sort. -  A   similar procedure has been used  with  good results in the past against villages   guilty of serious offences or of prolonged neglect to obey Government orders.   .       10.   I admit that there is  a danger  that in the  present state  of excited   feeling, when those Arabs who attacked our troops are  looked upon as warriors   in a holy cause, not as  bandits or evildoers, villagers might prove obstinate and   refuse to give up any firearms.   But, on the other hand, there is a general disgust   and weariness of the strike and all that it has entailed.       I  do not expect prolonged resistance, but it is possible.  If villagers adopt   such a course, I consider that their  resistance  to Government authority would   constitute a  clear  proof of the necessity for some measure of disarmament, and   of proving the determination of Government to exercise its authority in the cause   of public security.       Should such resistance be encountered, it would be necessary to resort to such   punishments as collective fines, as explained in  the preceding paragraph,  of the   demolition, after warning, of certain houses.       11.  Such a course as outlined above would cause a great outcry  among the   Arabs, but the Arabs have been  the aggressors, and it is they who have  caused   the death of  70 Jews and^a number of  soldiers and police protecting.  Jews, and,   in my  judgment, they must bear the  consequences of these acts in so  far  as the   security of law-abiding citizens is affected.                         .         -       12.  The obvious alternative is to  leave things as they  are.  I believe that   this course would give the country six months&apos; peace;  but there is ah  undoubted   danger that this period would be used to organise the country for further  armed   resistance should the decisions of His Majesty&apos;s  Government or the report of the   Royal  Commission  considerably disappoint Arab  aspirations.   The  better   prepared the populace is  for such resistance, the more will the&apos;Arabs  demand as   the price of peace.                                       ...         t       13.  The question of the disarmament of Jewish settlements is  a separate.   and a complicated problem, but it  would , clearly, be, better, if, there. were&apos; -simultaneous disarmament j of both communities,  and the Arabs would be i less   likely to resist disarmament if they knew that the Jews  were surrendering their   illegal  arms.   It is certain that the Jews have considerable,numbers,of;concealed   arms,  and, indeed, Mr.  Sb.er.tok. has  admitted to me  privately that  this  is so.   But they have not used them even in- self-defence, and. .1. do  not -think that they   have.any intention of using them aggressively against Arabs or in any way against   Government forces.  None the less, the existence of large numbers of unauthorised   arms is a menace to the peace of the country.
     14.   On the other hand, the events of the last few months have -justified the issue of 3,000 rifles to Jewish civilians, whom we have enrolled as supernumerary police.  These have given a feeling of security which, I consider, in view of past happenings, was needed, and may again be needed.     15.  The proposal which I would put to the Jewish Agency would be that they should arrange for the surrender of the arms at present secreted among the settlements, and for the complete disbandment of the &quot; Hagana,&quot; and that in return Government would be prepared to allow the three thousand supernumerary police to retain their arms, under the conditions explained in the succeeding para- graph of this despatch.  If the Jews refused to  hand over their hidden arms the Government would withdraw the rifles now in possession of the supernumerary police which were only issued as a temporary measure.  It would be to the advan- tage not only of Palestine generally and of the Government, but also of the Jewish Agency, if the arms in the possession of the settlers were known and registered and in the hands of selected Jews, rather than hidden and liable to be taken and used by the least reputable and the least law-abiding of the settlers.     16.  These three thousand Jewish supernumerary police would be organised as a police reserve, for the protection of  selected settlements or areas in  times of unrest.  They might be called Auxiliary  Police.  They would be volunteers, but the individuals would be carefully selected.   They would come  under definite regulations, and would be periodically drilled, paraded and inspected by regular police officers.   They would be provided with uniform, but they would be called up for service, and would be paid, only in time of emergency.  At all other times, save when they were needed for  drill, training  and musketry purposes, the rifles would be kept in  a locked armoury, which would not be opened without the sanction of the District administrative or police  authority.   Each  settlement  or  area would have its own group of reservists, within which different ranks would be created : the groups would be entirely local, and they, would on no account be regarded as a united corps.    17.   I  also suggest that in certain  isolated  Arab  villages two  or three Mukhtars  should  similarly be enrolled  as  auxiliary police with rifles  for the protection  of  the villages  against  bandits.  Both they and their rifles would similarly be under strict police control.    18.   I have not overlooked the different objections which may be advanced against the foregoing proposals.  Of these the principal are as follow : -      (i) Disarmament  might  provoke   a  recrudescence   of  Arab disorders,           particularly if it is not accompanied by the disarmament of the Jews.     (ii) Even if not actively opposed, so that drastic measures are not necessary, -           it will leave  bitterness behind; but this, I think, would be temporary           only.    (iii) It might provoke the Arabs to boycott the Royal Commission; but I           consider this very unlikely.     (iv) It might entail the employment of certain drastic measures under the           Palestine Defence Orders in Council 1931 and 1936 at a time when the           general state of the country did not justify such severe repression.    19.  In spite of these objections, I consider that a measure of disarmamentis so important that the difficulties must  be faced and  such steps taken as maybe agreed to be the most suitable for the attainment of that object.    I may add I saw Mr.  Ben Gurion*  and Mr. Shertok* this morning. Theypressed on me the need of Arab disarmament.  I  said to them that I would speakunofficially, and I then put forward  as  a possible Gentleman&apos;-s Agreement theproposal I  have outlined in paragraphs 15 and 16 above.  They appreciated myarguments, admitted confidentially that many Jews have arms, and received myunofficial proposal favourably.       ...        :.  .                     I have, &amp;c.                                            ARTHUR WAUCHOPE,     :    &apos;   &apos;        -              .
