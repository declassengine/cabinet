I reminded Mr. Jordan that it had been suggestedte the New Zealand Government, as well as to the other DominionGovernments, that they.should adopt a similar attitude, and was able to tell him that it now seemed certain that all the otherDominions would agree to this.  Mr. Jordan told me when saw him that in his personal view the position taken up bythe United Kingdom Government was a sound one, and that after his talk with Mr. Eden he and Sir James Parr had sent a telegram to his Government explaining the arguments against memoranda being sent in before tho Assembly meeting.  I gained the impression
from him that his Government would, probably refrain fromdespatching theirs,,                                               I3,     I heard no more until, two days later, I received theattached letter from Sir James Parr informing me that theNew Zealand Government had instructed him to transmit their memorandum to the League immediately.,  As will be seen fromthe enclosures to the letter, the memorandum was sent to theSecretary-General of the League at the same, time that Sir JamesParr&apos;s letter was written to me.  Neither Mr. Eden non were shown the memorandum before its despatch,4.    &apos; My colleagues will see that the memorandum contains aseries of far-reaching proposals, the purport of which is thatthe League Covenant should be strengthened^  Sir James Parrf scovering letter to me invites the observations of the UnitedKingdom Government on the proposals, and informs us that similar communications have been sent to all the DominionGovernmentso  I am in touch with the Foreign Secretary regardingany observations which we may wish to makeQ5*     I propose to see Mr. Jordan as sonn as possibleto tell him that the New Zealand Government have acted without consultation with us, on a matter which required consultationcI shall point out what unfortunate consequences might have followed if all the other Dominions and the United Kingdom had adopted a similar procedure.   We should probably have publishedto the world six different schemes for League reform, withoutany prior attempt to see whether the various ideas of the Britishnations could be made to harmonize with one another.   I shallremind him that the United Kingdom Government sometimes at great inconvenience to a Government carrying such responsibilitiesas it does in matters which are often urgent, makes a pointof informing and if necessary consulting its fellow members                          -2--
of the British Commonwealth on all  international  questionsof common concern;   a practice of which the  present New  zealand government have expressed their appreciation on a number ofrecent occasions;   and that it has  been agreed at more thanone Imperial Conference that this practice should befollowed by all the Governments of  the  Commonwealth,(Intld.)

The Secretary-General,  League of Nations-      GENEVA.                t            DOMINION OF NEW ZEALAND                              PRIME MINISTER&apos; S  OFFICE,                                  WELLINGTON.&apos;                              13th July, 1936.Sir,     In accordance with the resolution of the Assemblyof the League on the 4th July, 19365 and anticipating&apos;the formal request from the Council (as is necessary in  thecircumstances of New Zealand if the proposals of the NewZealand Government are to be received by the Secretary-General before the 1st September next) I have the honourto forward herewith an expression of the views  of the NewZealand Government on the Covenant  of the League of  Nations   (l)  We believe in the first place that there is  no        material fault in the existing provisions of the        Covenant and that the difficulties that  have arisen       - and that may arise in the future,  are due to the        method and the extent of its operation.   (2)  We believe that the Covenant has never yet been        fully applied and that it cannot be characterised        as an ineffective instrument until it has been so        applied.   (3)  We are prepared to reaffirm with the utmost        solemnity our.continued acceptance of the Covenant        as it stands.   (4)  We believe,  nevertheless, that  the Covenant  is        capable of amendment, which should take  the  form of        strengthening rather than weakening its  provisions.   (5;  We are prepared to accept,  in principle,  the        provisions proposed for the Geneva Protocol  of 1924        as one method of strengthening the Covenant  as it        exists.   (S)  We are prepared to take our collective share in the
       application, against any future aggressor, of the full *UL       economic sanctions contemplated &quot;by Article 16, and we are       prepared, to the extent of our power, to join in the       collective application of force against any future       aggressor. (7)        We believe that the sanctions contemplated by the       present Covenant will be ineffective in the future as       they have been in the past            (1)  Unless they are made immediate and automatic;            (2)  Unless economic sanctions take the form of the                   complete boycott contemplated by Article 16;            (3)  Unless any sanctions that may be applied are                   supported by the certainty that the Members                   of the League applying the sanctions are                   able, and, if necessary, prepared to use                   force against force. (8)        It is our belief that the Covenant as it is, or in       strengthened form, would in Itself be sufficient to       prevent war if the world realised that the nations       undertaking to apply the Covenant actually would do so in       fact. (9)        We are prepared to agree to the institution of an       International force under the control of the  League or       to the allocation to the League of a definite proportion       of the armed forces of its Members to the  extent, if       desired, of the whole of those forces - land,  sea and air.(10)        We consider that there can be no certainty of the       complete and automatic operation of the Covenant unless       the Governments of all Members of the League  are supported,       in their&apos; determination to apply it,  by the  declared       approval of their peoples. 11)        We propose,  therefore, that all the Members of the       League, and as  many non-Members as may be  persuaded to       adopt this course,  should hold immediately  a  national       plebiscite  with the object  of talcing the opinion of their                         -7-
peoples on the following points - (1)  Whether they are prepared to join automatically      and immediately in the sanctions contemplated by      Article 16 of the Covenant against any aggressor      nation nominated as such by the Council or. the      Assembly&quot; (2)  Whether in such case the armed forces of their      country (or such proportion as may previously have      been fixed by the League) should be immediately      and automatically placed at the complete disposal      of the League for that purpose.     We do not accept the desirability of regional pacts,but, if Members of the League generally approve of suchpacts, we should be prepared to support a collectivesystem in which all Members of the League while accepting the immediate and universal application of the economic sanctions contemplated by Article 16, nevertheless if they desired to do so restricted, to defined areas, their under-taking to use force.     In such a ca.se we consider1 that the question of theuse of &quot; force in defined areas should also be made the sub-ject of national plebiscites.     We believe it improper to enforce a system of pre-venting war without at the same time setting up adequatemachinery for the ventilation and,  if possible&apos;, rectlfi-cation of international grievances,  and we would supportthe establishment of an acceptable  tribunal for thatpurpose0     We believe that the Peace Treaties of the Great Warcarried within themselves the germs  of future  conflicts.We realise the enormous (but not  insuperable)  difficultiesof reconsidering the  status established by those  treaties and for our part we are prepared  in  the most genuine andbroaciminded spirit to join In such  a reconsideration.     As a first step we are prepared to agree  to  a  proposal
that the Covenant of the  League  should he  separated fromthese Peace Treaties.     For any general reconsideration of  the Peace Treatieswe should wish to see all the nations of the world., whethermembers of the League or  not, invited to take part.     We should wish also  to see  all the  nations of theworld, whether members of the League, or  not, invited totake part in the consideration of the terms and theapplication of the Covenant, or of any other universalmethod of collective security that may&apos;be  proposed in itsstead.     We realise the important effect of  economic con-ditions on the peace of the world and we sb.ou.ld wish, also,that a world-wide survey  of such conditions should beundertaken at the same time.     We feel that the peoples of the world, as distinct from their Governments, should be afforded every possiblefacility for following the transactions  of the League,and that all appropriate  League  discussions and decisions should accordingly be broadcast  by short-wave radio.     Finally, although we believe that a collectivepeace system that is not  supported by all the nations ofthe world is better than  no collective peace system atall, yet we are convinced that no such system can be entirely satisfactory until it is universal and that everyproper effort should be made to  that end.                I have etc.                   (Sgd.)   M. J.  SAVAGE                              Prime Minister.
