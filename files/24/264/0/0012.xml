Disorders  broke  out  in  Palestine  in  April  of this year  which,  afterrioting at Jaffa and elsewhere which was quickly suppressed, took the form of adeclaration by a Committee of Arab notables of a general  strike of a definitelypolitical character for aims inconsistent with the mandate and pursued by methods which directly challenge constituted authority.   There have  been widespread acts of murder and other outrages by gangs of armed terrorists.   Apart from attacks in which British soldiers, airmen and police as well as many Arabs and Jews have lost their lives, the  activities of  these  armed gangs have included  repeatedattempts  to  disorganise means of communication, the cutting  of telegraph and      [13763]
 telephone wires, the derailing of trains, and attempts to prevent the roads from being used by traffic.   Considerable material damage has been  done affecting seriously the economic life of the country, and several attempts have been made to damage and set fire to the oil pipe-line between Haifa and Iraq.  An important result of the strike has been  the practical closing of the Port of Jaffa, although happily the Port of Haifa has hitherto been little affected.     Active steps were at once taken by the  Palestine Administration : for  the protection of life and property and for the  suppression of disorder, and  during the  months  following the outbreak of the  disturbances the Palestine garrison has been considerably reinforced.   In spite,  however, of the greatest forbearance exercised by the British authorities,  with the full  approval of His  Majesty&apos;s Government, whose chief concern has  been to restore peace between the different communities in Palestine  by  measures which  would entail the smallest possible amount of suffering and loss of life,  the political strike has continued, accompanied by outrages  and guerilla warfare.   Widespread intimidation has been used by those  responsible for the continuance  of  these disorders  with  the  object of compelling at any rate the passive  co-operation of the Arab population at large. In short, the situation which has been created is a direct challenge to the authority of the British Government in  Palestine.     On the 18th May, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies announced in the House of Commons that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided that it was desirable that a full enquiry on the spot should be undertaken, but that the first step must be the re-establishment  of  law  and order; and that after order had been restored it was  their intention to advise His Majesty to appoint a Royal Commission which would, without bringing into question the fundamental terms of the Mandate, investigate the causes  of unrest and any alleged grievances either of Arabs or  Jews.     On the 29th July the personnel of the Royal Commission  was announced in the  House of  Commons, together  with its terms  of  reference, which are  as follows :          &quot; To ascertain  the underlying causes of the disturbances which broke     out in Palestine in the middle of April, to enquire  into the manner  in which     the Mandate for Palestine is being implemented in relation to the obligations     of the Mandatory  towards the Arabs and the Jews  respectively; and  to     ascertain whether, upon a proper  construction of the terms of the  Mandate,     either the Arabs or the  Jews have any  legitimate grievances on account     of the way in which the  Mandate has been, or is being implemented; and     if the Commission is satisfied that any such grievances are well  founded, to    make representations  for their  removal and  for  the prevention  of their    recurrence.&quot;     The Royal  Commission will undertake its  duties  at  the earliest possible moment, but, as  has  already  been  stated,  order must  be restored in  Palestine before the Commission begins its enquiry there.  This is a condition  essential to enable it  to  perform its duties effectively.  Unhappily,  however, the Arab leaders have taken up the position that they will not end the strike until funda- mental changes  have  been introduced by the British  Government in its  policy with regard to Palestine; and  notwithstanding the announcement of the personnel and terms of reference of the Royal Commission, the strike has continued, accom- panied by outrages of varying degrees of intensity in many parts of the country. All efforts to introduce a  reasonable spirit of accommodation have hitherto failed.    Well-disposed Arab rulers and notabilities in neighbouring countries have from time to time expressed  willingness to use their  influence  in attempts  at conciliation.  The King  of Saudi Arabia offered to use his good offices, acting in concert,  if  their  co-operation  could be  secured,  with  other  Arab rulers. Unfortunately, conditions have continued to be such that it has  not been  found possible to make airy successful progress by this means.  A public spirited attempt has also been made by His Highness the Amir  of Trans Jordan, but this likewisehas proved fruitless.  A further recent initiative in the same direction has been taken  by  General Nuri  Pasha-es-Said, Foreign  Minister of Iraq.  Protracted-discussions by him with  the Palestine Arab leaders have led to  no satisfactory result,  for the  Palestine  Arab  leaders  issued  on  31st  August  a  manifesto declaring,that they would continue  the strike until their aims had been attained.
         Despite  General  Nuri. Pasha&apos;s  intervention, daily  outrages and,  other.     instances of grave disorder have continued unabated, and after a careful review     of the whole situation His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that the: campaign.     of violence, and threats of violence, by which the Arab leaders are attempting to     influence the policy of  His Majesty&apos;s Government Cannot be allowed to.continue,;     and that more rapid and effective action must now be taken in order.to bring, the     present state of disorder to an end with the least possible delay.;-. iW-ith  this end     in view, it has been considered essential  to  send further  substantial reinforce-:     mentis to Palestine.  An additional Division  of troops is accordingly being sent     there.   In view  of  the  size of  the reinforcement,   and of  the additional     responsibilities entailed, it has been decided that the supreme military control in     the country shall  be entrusted to a Lieutenant-General.  The officer selected, for     the command  is  Lieutenant-General J.  G.  Dill,  C.B.,  C.M.G.,  D.S.O.,  late     Director-General  of Military Operations and Intelligence at the  War Office.         His Majesty&apos;s Government deeply regret that such decisions should have been     forced upon them.  Great Britain accepted the mandate for Palestine upon terms     which involve  responsibility for the welfare of all  sections  of the population of     Palestine.    They  regard this responsibility  as a  trust  which they  have     no choice  but to carry out.   In this connection it is appropriate  to  recall     that  in their  report to  the Council of  the League of Nations  in 1930 the     Permanent Mandates Commission stated  that, in  their  view,, the following two     assertions accurately expressed what it conceived to be the essence of the Mandate     for Palestine :          (1)  That the  obligations laid down in  the Mandate for Palestine in regard to               the two sections of the population are of equal weight;  and&apos;vso[       (2)  That the Ijteal  obligations imposed upon the Mandatory  are in no  sense               irreconcilable.         His Majesty&apos;s Government  are fully  in  accord  with the sense  of this     pronouncement at Geneva, and it is their  earnest desire  to carry out a policy of     impartial justice to both Arabs and Jews and to work for the peace and progress     of a country so specially dear  to both races.         It has been the constant aim of British policy to secure and maintain relations     of friendship  and confidence with the Moslem peoples.  For this reason,  apart     from all others, they would have wished to  avoid, by all possible means, the course     of action which has now been forced upon them.  But  no Government,  least of     all a  Government  exercising mandatory  responsibilities,  can  allow them-     selves to  be   deflected  from  their  course by violence and  outrage.   It  is     still  their hope,  however,  that  when those  who are disturbing the  peace     of Palestine   have  been  brought  to  realise  that  their  present  actions  are     inimical to the true interests of all sections of the population and to the  country     as a whole, and that the Mandatory Government is determined to exercise  its     authority with impartiality  and justice, it will be  possible  for the Royal     Commission to  proceed to Palestine to ascertain whether any legitimate grievances     or fears for the future exist  on the part  of either Arabs or Jews, and to make     recommendations for their removal with a view to establishing more cordial and     peaceful  relations  between all concerned.    His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  are     convinced that  these objects are attainable  within the framework of the Mandate,     which they have no intention of abandoning.        It  is  the  confident  hope of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government that the Royal     Commission  will  make  recommendations which   will  enable   His Majesty&apos;s     Government to bring finality to a  situation of doubt and fear on  both sides, and     that, out of the tragic misunderstandings  and disorder of the last five months, a     lasting settlement  can be reached.
