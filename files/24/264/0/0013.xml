THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,  Printed for the Cabinet.   September 19,36.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 238  (36).CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dear Ormsby Gore.Government House, Jerusalem,      September 4, 1936.    MANY thanks for your letter of the 25th about Sir Michael McDonnell andthe draft ordinance.    I greatly regret that I cannot feel hopeful about a Round Table Conferenceat present.   There have been a number of unofficial meetings this summer between certain Arabs  and Jews, but they ended with increased mistrust of each other.In view of the suggestion Weizmann made recently to you, I asked Shertok, inthe course  of  a  talk I had with him on  the 2nd September,  if he thought aconference between Arab and Jew was possible at this time,  and, if so, whetherit could lead to any good results.   Shertok thought not.   Shertok had taken partin the last conversation with certain Arabs,  and the chief cause of failure, Shertokthought,  was  because  responsible  Arab leaders would  not  enter  into seriousdiscussions with  Jews.  One of the Arabs who had taken part  in these discussionstold me the Jews began by making tentative promises, but on  closer investigationthey all  ended in smoke.  I said I looked on Ben Gurion,  for  example, asabsolutely straightforward, but my remarks met with no response.    I have now received  your  telegram  of  the 3rd,  giving  me  the Cabinetresolutions.  They are much what I had&apos;expected, except I had not thought you would be able to send a complete fresh Division.  But, if  I may say so, I think thedecision a wise one, especially with a Lieutenant-General to take command of allArmy Troops.    As I explained in my Secret despatch of the 22nd August, our present forces are making no headway at suppressing the  armed bands.  If these are  nowreinforced from  neighbouring Arab countries, we shall need  many  more troops,and the sooner  they come the better. Four months&apos; fighting have proved the Arabsto be stubborn and determined; 1,000 killed  and  wounded show  them to beresolute fighters.   We  have an arduous task before us.    But it was not so much due to that fact as it was to serious thought for thefuture of Palestine that has made me most anxious to find some means whether bysuspension of immigration or some new factor, such as the good offices of the iraqi government, whereby  a  fight to the finish could  be  avoided  and the  RoyalCommission start its enquiry early in October.    The Arab leaders have done little to help, and finally, by the terms of theirDeclaration of the 30th August, have done nothing to calm public opinion, quellresistance or assist Government to end disorder by any means except by force.[13772]
    So now I fully agree that the course we most hoped to avoid is the only course open.---------;  - -.......    - -............................   ----- --........-------------------------------------       The ending of Arab hopes of settlement by agreement will, I fear,  lead to increased, aggression and strengthening  of  armed  bands both  by villagers,ofPalestine  and neighbouring Arab countries.                                 t&apos;*&apos;    I fully agree that the situation now demands that supreme military&quot; control&apos;should be entrusted to Lieu tenant-General Dill, who will ad m i n i ster Martial LayvjI will, of course, carry out your suggestion  and consult Dill on his arrival on points relating to the  application of Martial Law.   Unless Dill disagrees, my own opinion is that Martial Law should be applied to the whole country  as soonas Dill is  prepared to  administer  Martial Law.    Peirse and I are both naturally very sorry not to have ended these disorders,but we both recognize that, as the situation now is, a single military commandermust carry through that job.    From start to finish the Arab leaders have refused to face realities and made no effort to end methods of violence.    I fly  to Amman to-morrow to lunch with  Abdullah,  who  has consistentlygiven his support to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and very valuable that supporthas proved to be in Trans Jordan.                                           Yours  very sincerely, &apos;       -                                                ARTHUR WAUCHOPE.
