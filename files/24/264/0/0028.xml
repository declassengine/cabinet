Dr.  Schacht&apos;s Visit to  Paris.    IN the absence of the Prime Minister and  Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the Lord President of the Council has authorised the circulation of theattached despatch from Berlin, to which the Permanent Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs has  drawn his particular attention.                             (Signed)    2Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,          October 2, 1936.M.  P.  A. HANKEY,       Secretary to the Cabinet.            Mr.  Newton  to Mr. Eden. ^Received September 17.)(No. 984.)Sir,                                           Berlin,  September 15, 1936.    WITH reference to my telegram No. 245, Saving, of the 11th September,  Ihave the honour to inform you that the Roumanian Minister in Berlin, M. Comnen,mentioned to me  recently  certain information which he had received  regardingDr. Schachfs visit to Paris.    2.  M.  Comnen  understood that Dr. Schacht  had explained to the FrenchGovernment that one reason for the increase in the  period of military service waseconomic.  Germany&apos;s campaign against unemployment  and the revival of herindustry were largely based upon the growth and equipment of her militaryforces.  She must therefore continue  to increase these  forces unless her economic development and  the raw  materials which she needed  could be assured to her inother ways.  He thus seems to have hinted that, unless Germany was helpedeconomically, there would be a further increase of her armed forces in due course,but that, given such help, limitation might be possible.  He also raised Germany&apos;claim to colonies, representing them,  no  doubt, as a partial satisfaction of her economic requirements.  His account in these respects seems  to  tally generally with that given to His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Paris.   M.  Conmen&apos;s information,&quot;however, was that the French attitude in  regard to economic help in general, and colonies in particular, was not discouraging, and had, in fact, been receptive. Asregards colonies,  there is a hint to  this effect in the article  by Herr Kircherreported in my despatch No. 983 of the 15th September.  M. Comnen understoodthat the visit was regarded in France as a success, and from his  manner it was evident that he thought the upshot of these conversations  might not be  altogetherto the liking of His Majesty&apos;s Government.     3.  From these  various accounts it  rather looks as though Dr. Schacht hasbeen threatening  France with a further increase of German military forces, and now proposes (see paragraph 7 of my above-mentioned saving-gram) to threatenGreat Britain also with  the responsibility for any trouble  which Germany may       [13876]
make,  unless France  and Great  Britain, or perhaps- Great Britain alone, areprepared to buy her off.  At the back of his unscrupulous mind may also lurk the thought: of sowing disagreement as to who should pay the German piper.     4.  This line of negotiation would, indeed, be an exploitation of Germany&apos;secpnprniS situation.  For her poverty, so far as it genuinely exists, islargelylofher own making.  It is due to her revolutionary upheaval, to her treatment of theJews,  to her  costly social  schemes  and expenditure on roads, buildings  and propaganda, to her unscrupulous treatment of foreign creditors and- refusal  to adapt her price level by normal methods to that of the outside world, and to herdisregard for  economic considerations in any matters even remotely concernedwith military  preparation.   Dr. Schacht,  in his present role, claims  to  be the spokesman of orthodox finance, speaking to those  who stand for orthodoxy.  Thewhole force of his argument rests on that basis.  It is some inversion of normalprinciples  when he requests that Germany, as an economic  sinner, should berewarded for her sins.  His argument is hardly  made more respectable when in the vein of a highwayman rather than of an eminent economist he  threatensfurther misdeeds, in the form of another military increase; and now. also a  newfour years&apos; plan of autarchy, if his demands are not met.  But it is surely eitherinfatuation or cynical effrontery when,  in the name of sound finance, Dr. Schachtdemands, in addition, that Germany should be given a colony, the developmentof which would (whether Dr. Schacht  realises it  or not) for years to come  be a heavy addition to  the economic burdens which he professedly  wishes to lighten.Not  only would  Germany be burdened, but  expenditure on the  monopolisticdevelopment of a colony would  also be counter  to  the  very policy which heostensibly champions of a return to normal trading methods.     5.  In the long run an economic nemesis may  be the only force, short of war,capable of  putting  a  limit  on Germany&apos;s ambitions.   Germany&apos;s  economicrehabilitation, much as we may  desire it, can only  be  in the general interestprovided that it furthers peace.  We do not want,  in giving economic help, merely to encourage Dr. Schacht and his like to prosecute a dangerous policy of expansionwith all the greater vigour.  If, therefore, the reckless  German piper is to be paid at all,  it should not only be in some other form than  a transfer of colonies, butalso  should  be in return for a general renunciation of disturbing ambitions.  Ifthis  is too much to hope for, at the very least Germany,  and above all the economistDr.  Schacht, should drop so completely inconsistent a claim as  that to a costlycolony.                                                   I have,  &amp;c.                                                        B. C. NEWTON.
