                             I. INTRODUCTORY.Terms of Reference.1     1.  We were appointed by the Prime Minister    &quot; to consider  the experiments  that  have taken  place or are  proposed in     connection with the defence against aircraft and the vulnerability from the     air of capital ships.&quot;     2.  A strict interpretation of these terms of reference would  narrow thefield of enquiry to the purely technical and material aspects of the question.  we felt, however, that  we should be justified in going rather further, and  we have considered and discussed other matters arising from the terms of reference whichwere evidently relevant to the general object  of  the  enquiry.&apos;  It would, forexample, be unsatisfactory to deal with the vulnerability of capital ships to air attack without taking into account the extent to which they may become liableto this form of attack; at the same time we have tried to confine within necessarylimits our survey of these wider questions, which,  indeed, involve the functionsof the Navy in War, possible theatres of war, and  the strategical use of AirForces. These problems are beyond our terms of reference and,  if they were tobe adequately considered, would need an enquiry of  a  different nature, such as was carried out by Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s Committee in 1921.Procedure of the Inquiry.     3.  We have been greatly assisted in our  Inquiry  by our Expert Advisers,the Chief of the Naval Staff and the Chief of the  Air  Staff, who have suppliedus freely with all the information  at their disposal, much of it of an extremelysecret nature, and have throughout co-operated with  us, and with each other, in presenting us with all  the necessary data and, whenever possible,  with agreedviews. We are glad to record that agreement exists between them on many of thematters which have  been considered.     4.  We felt,  however, that we should be  right to  get also opinions of others,and we therefore invited a number of gentlemen to give us the  benefit  of theirviews, either by attendance at a meeting or by the submission of Memoranda. Alist of those  who accepted this invitation is attached as Appendix  A.   It willbe observed that all of them have  had personal experience of the matters underenquiry.   We invited, however, some of them to give us  the benefit of their viewsnot so much because we had reason to think that their experience was very greator up to date, but because they had made speeches or written  articles in the Pressexpressing confident opinions as to the liability of the  capital ship to be destroyed or seriously  damaged by air attack.  For the most part the  witnesses who came under this description  recognised that they had not the  information which is naturally only possessed by the Service Departments, but they gave us all  the helpat their disposal and we are grateful to them for their contribution to our  enquiry.Others who responded to our request have special technical qualifications, and inone or two cases have held high positions in one or other of the Services.  To them also we are  under an obligation for the trouble they have taken  to  answer ourenquiries.     5.  We also considered that we should ascertain whether certain shipbuildingfirms of high standing had any. views which might be of  assistance to us.  we accordingly   approached   representatives  of  Cammell  Laird,  Vickers  andJohn Brown &amp; Co.  with an enquiry as to whether they were in possession ofany information not likely to be available in the Service Departments, particularly as to whether the designs of British  battleships are fully up to  date and in no way inferior to those of foreign countries.   These firms have all replied  to theeffect that, owing to the fact that they have had no  recent experience of buildingbattleships, they have no special information of their own not in possession of theAdmiralty.  At the same time two of the firms paid tribute to the knowledge and efficiency of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors.     6.  With these preliminary observations we pass to  a survey of the questions raised by our Terms of Reference.
             II. THE EFFECT  OF  BOMBS ON  SHIP CONSTRUCTION. Nature of experiments carried out.     7.   During the war bombing attacks on ships were made with small bombs which were comparatively ineffective.   The protection which necessarily existed in warships to withstand  shell attack was more than  sufficient to withstand bombing attack.  Immediately after the war the Admiralty anticipated that there would be steady progress not only in the size of the bomb, but also in the methods of carrying out  attacks.   Bombing   trials  on  actual  ships being  generally impracticable on the score of expense, it was decided to attack the problem in a similar way to that employed for the problem of protection by  armour  against shell attack.     8.   The value of armour against shell attack is determined at the proof ranges by firing the shell from a gun placed close to the plate.  The shell is made to strike  the plate  at the appropriate velocity and angle at wmich it would hit when fired from a gun at the long  range of a fleet action.  The first trials were designed  to  test whether a bomb could similarly be  projected  from a  gun or howitzer at the appropriate velocity and angle that it would have if dropped from a  height by aircraft.  These trials, which commenced in 1920, showed that the arrival of bombs on the deck could be  simulated  in this manner.   The next step was to ascertain the penetrating capacities of various  bombs and the thicknesses of deck armour necessary to resist them.     9.  These trials commenced in 1921 and have been continued to  the present day.  The types of bombs on which experiments have been carried out include the light  case  and   the semi-armour-piercing  bomb,  both  of  which  carry   a comparatively large explosive charge for their weights, and the armour-piercing bomb which, being of stronger construction,  has  a  greater penetration  but  a smaller bursting charge than either of the former.  We have had laid before  us detailed  descriptions  of these numerous experiments,  a list of which is given in Appendix B.  We do not think it necessary, or desirable, to record them in detail, but we note that the  experiments have  been carried out with a large number  of different bombs up to 2,000 lb. in weight.  We are satisfied that  the  Admiralty, as a result, have been able to  make detailed  calculations as to the necessary thicknesses of deck to keep out these various  kinds and weights of bombs,  if dropped from various heights.     10.  This process of laboratory experiments has been  carried  further by practical tests.   Before starting the reconditioning of individual capital  ships, two targets were erected to  represent an existing battle cruiser and a battleship respectively, and further experiments were carried out on these  in order to deter- mine the lines on which improved protection could best be given.   As ships become due to be modernised the lessons learned from previous experiments have been taken into account and the necessary modifications introduced.    11.   But the problem does not end with the determining of the probable thickness of armour which a bomb can  penetrate.   There are other matters to be considered, such as the damage which will be effected by a bomb after it has effected the maximum penetration of which it, is capable, which  in the case of instantaneously fused light  case bombs  is on the  weather deck.  The Admiralty and Air Ministry have carried out experiments in all these matters continuously and methodically.  Having determined as a result of firing or dropping unfused bombs how far, under given conditions of weight  and height, they can penetrate into  a ship,  they have subsequently placed similar bombs in the positions so reached, in vessels to be scrapped, and have detonated the bombs in those positions, in order to gauge their effect.  They have thereby acquired valuable information as to the best methods of construction for reducing the damage done by the individual bomb, and localizing  its effects, and there  is agreement between  the  Admiralty and the Air Ministry as to the defence properties of the new capital ships, in their constructional aspects, against bombs of various weights.Effect of instantaneously fused bombs.    12.   In order to  judge  the results of instantaneously fused bombs burstingon the deck, bombs of  this nature have been laid in various positions on deck and detonated, and  the  damage to superstructure which  was to be  expected from
is explosive charges of the various weights could be observed.  The Admiralty have stated in this connection that the effect so far as the fighting efficiency of the ship is concerned was small, but we think that further trials should be carried out with a view to determining the possible effect of this kind of attack on anti-aircraft equipments and their crews,  since these will necessarily be more exposed than the main armament of the ship, the  control stations,  engine  rooms and magazines. The Admiralty and the Air Ministry have agreed to carry out experiments of this nature. The &quot; near miss.&quot;     13.   It has been stated in various quarters that, even if a bomb fails to hit a ship directly, the explosive effect of its detonation in the water  close to a ship&apos;s side will have serious results.  The Admiralty have carried out experiments also in this regard in order to test the effect of the &quot; near miss.&quot;  It has been found that the &quot; bulge &quot; with which capital ships are provided to protect them against torpedo attack provides a large degree of security also against the &quot; near miss.&quot; In fact, the Admiralty are of the opinion that the results of experiments confirm that the &quot;near miss&quot;  is not a vital menace to a modern battleship.  It has been represented to us that  the portions of the ship most likely  to be damaged are the propellers and the condenser inlets, but this is not the view of the Admiralty. Experiments with a moving ship.     14.   It has been suggested to us that it would be useful to carry out a bombing experiment against a moving ship to ascertain whether a hit under the conditions of a moving ship would cause greater damage than in the case of a stationary ship. We are not in a position to judge the necessity, or the practicability, of such a test, but we call the attention of the Admiralty to the suggestion. The American Experiments.     15.   A great deal of publicity has been accorded to American experiments carried out  between 1922  and 1925  against three  warships which  had been scrapped : some publicists, in the absence of knowledge of the series of experiments conducted here, rely very largely on these American experiments to argue their case that the day of the capital  ship is over.   We have received information regarding these  American  experiments, and their  results,  from  the  account prepared by the American Navy and subsequently published, and we are clear that these trials, which were in many  respects peculiar to themselves, do not by any means constitute the last word on the subject.  On the contrary, the Admiralty, taking into account the nature  and results of those early experiments, have since gone into the matter much further and much more thoroughly.   The American experiments were  a valuable beginning and useful guide and  have been  used as such.  We attach as Appendix  C a report  on  these experiments which was laid before us.  It may be noted in passing that, although the Americans are, of course, in possession of all the information regarding their own trials, they have  not thereby been induced to cease building capital ships, as some of the critics here, on less complete information, would wish us to do. Recapitulation.     16.   A list indicating the types of experiments which have been carried out is given in Appendix B.  These experiments have been carried out by the Admiralty and  Air Ministry in close co-operation.   We are satisfied that the Admiralty realise how important it is, if only in their own interests, to ascertain as accurately as possible the amount of damage which may be incurred by aircraft attack and we consider they have taken all proper steps to that end.   We are assured that the lessons which have been learned will be applied especially  in the construction of the two new capital ships and that lessons arising out of later experiments, which will continue as a matter of course, will be embodied as found necessary.  It may be that the contact  between the two Departments is  capable of being further developed, and we trust that no effort will be spared to  do  so.  It is obvious that there are two aspects, the defensive side which affects the Admiralty, the offensive side which affects both the Admiralty and the  Air Ministry, and from everyexperiment there will be lessons to be learned of value to each of them in these two different aspects.
     17.  Certain experiments have  already been  agreed upon to take place in the autumn upon particular aspects of the problem which will appear later in the Report.  We recommend  the continuance of  experiments in  this and in  other matters which will be referred to subsequently, and we think  that the provision of funds and material should not be allowed to stand in  the way.                        III. ACCURACY OF BOMBING. Forms of Attack.     18.  The various methods of attacking ships from the air are as follows :       Level Bombing is attack delivered from a high altitude with the  assistance of a precise  bomb-sighting apparatus.   It is the only  method by which any considerable penetration of deck armour can be effected.  It can, of course, only be used when the cloud base is high enough to allow the  aeroplane to sight on the target at the requisite altitude.  In order to get penetration, even with a 2,000-lb. armour-piercing bomb, of the deck armour of one of our new capital ships an aeroplane would have to fly at a height of about 10,000 feet.     Dive Bombing is a method of attack that can be used when the cloud base is too low for  level bombing.  The bombs are dropped from a low altitude, by judgment, from a steeply diving aeroplane. There  is insufficient striking velocity to  obtain penetration of armour  and (so far as capital  ships are concerned)  the effects will be limited to the superstructure and to anti-aircraft guns and crews on the upper deck.  This method of attack may be used in combination with  other methods of attack in  order to give cover to them.     Torpedo Attack  consists of dropping torpedoes from aircraft at a very low altitude fairly close  abeam the ship.  Its drawback is  that it strikes the  most heavily protected part of the ship, the bulged and armoured sides.  It also exposes the aircraft  to  the easiest shot  from the anti-aircraft guns.   Against heavily armoured ships  it is not considered by the Staffs to  be as good a method of attack as the other methods. Level Bombing.     19.  The Staffs are agreed that, under peace conditions at the present  time, with average  personnel using the automatic bomb sight,  from 10,000  feet at a speed of 100 knots, half the bombs dropped would fall inside a circle of 100 yards radius, the centre of the circle being the point of aim.  This represents 11 per cent. of hits against a ship the size of the Centurion, a ship of 23,000 tons.  There are, however, a number of qualifications and  external  factors  which may well affect deductions drawn from the present information.     20.  Apart from the effects of anti-aircraft fire which are considered later, there are other  factors, such as the effect of avoiding action on  the part of the target, the loss of accuracy due to increased height, the effect of the use of faster aircraft, and  errors which may arise from the fatigue  of personnel after  long flights.   The  extent to which these factors may affect the probable percentage of hits given in the preceding paragraph is at present a matter of opinion, but we do not think it need so remain.  We recommend that experiments, jointly agreed upon in advance and jointly analysed,  should be carried out to determine  the facts. The Staffs  are agreed that the methods of carrying out  and analysing  practices are capable of improvement and that practices will be carried  out in future not only for training purposes, but to reproduce as accurately as possible the tactics that would be employed in actual practice;  analysis  will then show the consequent variations in accuracy to be expected. Dive Bombing.     21.  Under peace conditions it has been found that  half the bombs dropped by  trained personnel, dive-bombing without sights from  1,500-2,000 feet,  will fall inside a circle of  50 yards radius, the centre of the circle being the point of aim.  This corresponds to 27 per  cent, of hits on Centurion.  This  has  been agreed by the Service  Departments concerned, but further experiments are needed to determine whether these figures will be affected by height of release  (to allow for increase in diving speed), decrease in angle of dive, and possible errors afterlong flights.
192     22.   These questions appear to be determinable after further experiments in which the Staffs have agreed to co-operate. The Effect of Anti-Aircraft Fire on Accuracy of Bombing.     23.   In the next section of this Report we deal with the probable results of anti-aircraft fire on attacking aircraft.  But, apart from the number of casualties which such fire may inflict, it seems  to us that there is bound to be some,  and perhaps considerable, loss in bombing accuracy on the part of aircraft which have escaped  material damage.  There may be a physical effect  caused by disturbance on the aircraft due to close shell  bursts, which may deflect the aim, and  also personnel who are under heavy fire may well be affected in their determination to carry out an effective attack.     24.   We think the  two points of view  on this subject, which represent opinions held not only in the Service Departments most concerned, but by others as well, should be set forth.     25.   On the one hand, it is held by the Air Ministry that the inaccuracy to aim caused by disturbance of the aircraft by close shell bursts  is  not likely to be appreciable.  There are  records to show that  the  oscillations of  aircraft are substantially  less under  automatic than under  manual control under the same conditions of weather.  The psychological effect of anti-aircraft fire will no doubt vary at different stages of the campaign and with the types of personnel available, but the only safe assumption is that the enemy would use the best trained and most intrepid of his airmen.     26.   The other  point of view, which is taken by the Admiralty, is that non- vital gunfire will have a physical effect not less serious than the &apos;&apos; bumpiest&apos;&apos;  and most difficult weather conditions. Experience shows that this is very considerable, and it is not considered that automatic controls will modify the effect, since the reactions of a human pilot to such sudden (as opposed to gradual) variations are more immediate  than the reactions of any existing  automatic  control.  It is therefore expected that effective gunfire will  considerably increase errors.  In addition, the psychological effect, which it is not possible to assess quantitatively, is likely to lead to an increase in height  of release  which will result in an additional loss of accuracy.    27.   It is impossible for us  to give judgment as to which of  these opinions is likely to be correct.    There  is no  evidence to guide us, or others, as to the possible physical effects of non-vital anti-aircraft fire.  The psychological question will remain a matter of opinion until  it is tested out in war.  However high the standard of training  of  attacking pilots, and  it would  be unwise to assume anything but  a high standard, the excitement of action,  the deterrent effect of close shell bursts, the fact that the airman is carrying out an attack on  the gun itself and not avoiding the gun in order to attack some objective beyond, all these are factors which would  seem certain to affect statistics arrived at under peace conditions.                          IV. ANTI-AIRCRAFT  FIRE.    28.  In no part of our enquiry have we found more  difficulty than in the assessment of the probable results of the anti-aircraft fire by which ships defend themselves against  bombing attack.  It is, of  course,  impossible  to simulate in time of peace  all  the conditions of war, and experiments carried out under peace conditions afford only a guide, from which it  is easy  to draw false deductions. The first type of anti-aircraft fire which we now discuss is that directed  against &quot; level bombing &quot; attack, as distinct from &quot; dive &quot; bombing and torpedo attack.A gainst  Level Bombing A ttaclc.    29.  Naval anti-aircraft training against  &quot; level bombing&quot;  is normally carried out  against  a &quot; sleeve target &quot; towed  by an aeroplane, and against  the &quot; Queen Bee &quot;  target, a small aircraft without   a  pilot  and  controlled by wireless.  The &quot; sleeve &quot; target is comparatively slow,  and the towing aeroplanehas to  fly, without any considerable alteration of course, or height,  across the  arcof the gun.  The Queen Bee target, a comparatively recent development, is  capableof manoeuvre to simulate  the kinds of avoiding action which an attacking pilot
might take.  It, however, is also relatively slow;  its maximum speed being about90 m.p.h., whereas modern aircraft can fly at speeds up to 300 m.p.h., though theymay require to slow down below that speed in order to get accuracy of aim.  Thedifference in speeds between the target used in peace and the target to be engagedin war is important chiefly for the following  reasons : &apos;      (i) Crews trained in  peace may need to gain some experience to accustom           themselves  to bring fire to bear on faster-moving  objects in war.           Crews  are, however, being trained to deal with  faster targets and,           as the Queen Bee target develops, its speeds should approximate more           closely to those of service aircraft.  Training is also carried out using           service aircraft at full speed, but without actually firing.    (ii) The aircraft,  flying faster,  imparts  a greater initial  forward velocity to           the bombs, the result is that it  can release the  bomb at  a greater           distance from the ship  and thereby force the gun to try and hit it           earlier and at a longer range.    30.  Nor is actual  speed  the only difference between peace time and wartargets.  The Queen Bee is expensive, and has, very naturally, been manoeuvredrather with a view to give  training and to avoid damage than to simulate closely the probable  action of  a  determined  attacker. We consider that, even at the riskof greater damage than heretofore, it  is  important that  Queen Bee  targets,improved patterns of which will have a  better performance, should on occasionsbe manoeuvred as they would if carrying out an attack in war,  and at the probableheight at which aircraft would seek to attack.   More accurate information will then be obtained as to  the probability of  hitting, and more realistic training willbe afforded to the anti-aircraft gun and director crews.    31.  We have been informed  that  it  is part  of  naval anti-aircraft  firediscipline to withhold fire for effect  until the aircraft is making the approach to bomb, since for a short time before the moment of release the aircraft is bound to fly on a straight, or slightly curvilinear  course and  cannot take  avoiding action.In assessing probable results the length of that time is obviously a very important question.   The Air Ministry are of the opinion that with the new bomb sightswhich will soon be available the time of straight flight can  be  reduced  to some20 seconds;  the Admiralty question whether that will be possible, and estimate that the period, including slightly curvilinear flight,  during which effective  firecan be brought to bear,  will be about 90 seconds, and do not  consider that even with  the  new sights  the period of  straight flight can  be reduced to  so  low as20 seconds.    32.   We do not think that there should be any great difficulty, once  the newsights are available, in testing the matter out, and we recommend that this shouldbe done.  That will eliminate at least one unknown quantity for the future.    33.   There are other  difficulties in drawing  deductions from peace-timepractices, such as the fact that the speed of the Queen Bee is  a known factor,whereas an  attacking pilot can in practice alter  his  speed and so  upset  thegunner&apos;s  previous calculations;  as also  the fact that  practices are necessarilypre-arranged and the element of surprise is therefore absent.   In the heat  andexcitement  of  action,  and especially  if  a  naval   action  is  taking  placesimultaneously^ there  will certainly be some loss of accuracy in anti-aicraft  fireas compared with the results of practice in the less trying&apos;conditions of peace,when the gun is not being made the object of attack.     34.   The Admiralty have provided  us  with figures, which cannot  be morethan  estimates, as to the probable number of hits which anti-aircraft guns  willbe able to effect against  attacking aircraft, judged from results hitherto obtained and taking into account the various uncertain factors which are referred to above.These figures indicate a considerable probability of hits.     35.   The Air Ministry,  whilst  agreeing  with the method  of estimatingcasualties that has been adopted, do not consider that it is sound to assume thatthe results obtainable against  the Queen Bee targets can be assimilated to thoselikely to be obtained against actual bombing aircraft.  We are disposed  to agreethat  the unreal conditions under which anti-aircraft practice has hitherto takenplace, although largely unavoidable, makes it difficult, if not impossible, to accept any figures until much more information is available.  It will be realised that any
figures arrived at from peace-time practice will always be largely theoretical;  only under war conditions, impossible to simulate in peace, can there be a completelysatisfying test.  But the difference between the two points of view can, we think,be considerably narrowed down by making, as we recommend, peace-time practiceassimilate more closely to war conditions.  To this end  we think the admiralty and the Air Ministry, for their joint benefits, should work in very close touch.The Staffs have agreed that future practices  designed to provide data as to the efficacy of anti-aircraft fire should be carried out against Queen  Bee targetscontrolled to simulate as closely as possible the tactics of the type of attack  theyare  intended to represent,  and to consult  together  as to what  these  tacticsshould be.     36.   One experiment has been suggested to us as being capable  of providingsome provisional data until such time as more information is obtained as the resultof developments in training and material.  It is that a modern high performancebomber should be flown over the existing ballistic apparatus at  Orfordness, wherea  mobile  anti-aircraft gun with  the  necessary  range-finding  and  predictingapparatus should be installed.  The ballistic apparatus  is capable of accuratelyrecording the position in space of an aeroplane at any moment  of time, and afterthe procedure of laying and firing is carried out, a close estimate of the positionin space of a shell burst at the same instant could be made.  The experiment, itis  claimed, would give some indication of the capacity  of anti-aircraft guns todeal with modern high performance aeroplanes.  If that  claim  is well-founded, itwill obviously be.very valuable in checking data at present in possession.   We asa  Committee have not the technical knowledge  to give an opinion as  to  thepossibilities and usefulness of an experiment on these lines, but we commend thesuggestion as one which should certainly be pursued by those concerned.Against dive bombing and torpedo attach.     37.  Anti-aircraft fire to meet dive  bombing and  torpedo attack requiresseparate consideration.   The Admiralty have developed  special weapons to  dealwith this form of attack, the eight-barrelled Mark M.  Pom-Pom firing a 2-lb.shell and  the four-barrelled  -g-inch machine gun.  In  addition, the barrage firelong-range guns comprising  the  anti-ship armament  of the vessel would  beemployed  against short-range air attack.     38.  Trials  have been carried  out  over a considerable  period,  but they are necessarily based on photographic analysis, as it is only quite recently that it hasbeen found technically possible for pilotless aircraft to execute diving attacks.     39.  We have been provided by the Admiralty with  estimates of the numberof hits likely to be obtained by anti-aircraft weapons against short-range attacksof this kind.  They  are  derived from photographic analysis of the  accuracy  ofgun-laying against a large number of  simulated attacks carried out by  actualaircraft.  Whilst the Naval and Air Staffs are again agreed that the method  ofanalysis used for the estimation of casualties is  a reasonable  one,  they are not agreed that the results are applicable to the conditions to be expected in the fleet in practice.   Here, again, we see difficulty in accepting as firm  figures deductionsmade from tests which took place under conditions necessarily  very  remote fromthose of war,, and we doubt if any real advantage would be gained in  recording inthis Report figures so obtained.     40.  It  will probably always  be extremely  difficult in  time  of peace  tosimulate realistic attacks of these natures; the difficulties are  even  greater thanin the case of the level bombing target.  Whilst we invite the  two departments to co-operate as far as possible, we desire  to record the impression which theevidence has  left on our minds, that the steps taken by the Admiralty to engageshort-range  attack will result in  a very  powerful concentration of fire  whichmust, though to what precise extent  it is impossible to  say, affect the accuracyand the morale of the attacker.     41.  There are,  however, various means by which attacking aircraft  would attempt to gain a measure of surprise and so to reduce the likelihood of casualties,.such as attacking from the direction of the sun, or  from different directions atthe same time, night attacks assisted by flares, or attacks covered by smoke screens.These are tactical methods of which the Services  are fully aware, and we do not doubt that they will continue to experiment, and to co-operate, in their practice.
Increase in volume of anti-aircraft fire.     42.  Whatever may be the precise figure to be allotted to the accuracy of the anti-aircraft fire,  there can be no doubt as to the great volume of anti-aircraft fire which a number of ships can now develop, and the number of guns can stillfurther be increased if found necessary.  Those who rely  for their criticisms of anti-aircraft fire merely on experience in the late war (we do not include the AirMinistry in this category) are working on a basis quite unreliable.  Whilst, apartfrom increased speed and  power of manoeuvre, aircraft remain as vulnerable as before, and the target they offer increases with their size, there have been greatdevelopments  in numbers  and calibres of guns,  weight of shell, accuracy andrapidity of fire.A ammunition Supply.     43.  The rates  of  fire of  anti-aircraft  guns have  been much increased ofrecent years, partly by improved training  and partly by the adoption of new weapons. When air attack on ship was only probable when opposing fleets were at sea, i.e., from carrier-borne aircraft, the quantity of ammunition to be carriedwas relatively small.  But if, as is quite possible, our fleet, whether at sea or in harbour, is in future to be ready for heavy attack from shore-based aircraft, thereis no doubt that the amounts of ammunition to be carried on board will have tobe much greater than in the past.   We have been informed that the ammunitionat present carried  for the long-range gun is 250 rounds per gun, which will suffice to engage fourteen attacks, allowing 90 seconds for the period of engagement ofeach attack.   Similarly, the  Mark M. Pom-pom  (provided with 1,800 rounds abarrel) can engage 85 attacks, allowing 12 seconds for the period of engagementof each  attack.  In  harbour,  with facilities for rapid  replenishment, no great anxiety need  be felt, but we think that the question may now require re-examina-tion from the point of view of ships operating for considerable periods in narrowwaters within range of  shore-based attack.                        V. WEIGHING THE BALANCE.New dangers met by neiv methods of defence.     44.  It is, of course, no new matter to  the  Admiralty to have to consider the vulnerability of ships in the light of some new weapon and to adopt new measures for their defence and protection.  The last 40  years have seen the advent of thesubmarine, the torpedo and the mine.  Each of these have had great effects on naval warfare, but new forms of attack have  always, sooner or later,  producednew forms of defence.  The question is whether attack  from the air, unlike the others, is incapable of being met.   The work of the Committee on Air defence research is evidence of the efforts which are being  made, in another sphere, tocreate new forms of defence against the menace of air attack.     45.  It is one. of the main characteristics of a battleship that she is built to resist attack both above and below water from guns, torpedoes and mines. against air attack rearrangement and improvement of  her protection  is  needed, theAdmiralty make no  claim  that a ship, however designed, can be  invulnerable inall circumstances to every form of attack.  But they do think that the capital ship of the future  can  be so designed as to distribution of her armour on  decks andsides, and as  to interior subdivision, that she will not be subject to fatal damage from the air.  The effect  of hits by aerial bombs is analogous to  plunging longrange fire from guns.  The Admiralty view is that there is no reason why the shipcannot be designed to meet air attack just as in the past she has been designed tomeet other dangers.     46.  These views, of  course, are not those of the critics of the capital  ship,who maintain that a concentrated air attack on ships at sea or in harbour will beso effective that they cannot survive.  It is a point of view that has yet to be testedin practice.     47.  Whatever the future may have in  store the truth at present probablylies  between  these  two extremes.    Given the  greatest  possible  measure  ofprotection on the  constructional side against  air attack much,  of  course, will depend on the scale of attack which can be  brought  to bear.  In that connection
 the size of the air force of a potential enemy and the distances of his aerodromes from the areas in which our Fleet will  operate  and from the bases which that Fleet will use, are two important factors. Strategical questions.     48.  Here we meet the strategical questions  which, though they are,  strictly speaking, outside our terms of reference, have a bearing on the general object of our enquiry.  Putting on one side the question of air attack from carriers which are themselves far more vulnerable to air attack than battleships, it is clear that if the areas in which our ships may operate are so far from enemy aerodromes as to make air attack impossible, the vulnerability of  ships does not arise.  At the other end of the scale, for example, is the heavy scale of air attack which could be launched against  our   Fleet in  Malta  by  Italian aircraft  based on  Sicily. Whether or not an enemy will decide to use his air power against our naval forces is a matter which cannot be determined in  advance, but the fact that  we are dependent for our existence on our sea communications behoves us, more than any other Power,  to anticipate that kind of attack.     49.  Although our Fleet may have to operate  in comparatively narrow waters such as the Mediterranean and the North Sea, it may also have to do  so in the larger oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific, much of whose spaces are at great distances from the air bases of any potential enemy. But that is only one aspect of  the  matter, for those oceans, of which the free passage is essential  to our national existence, cannot at present be covered by our own land-based air forces. It would not  be impossible for the capital ships of a hypothetical enemy, in the absence  of a  powerful  British  Fleet,  to  place themselves, without interference, across our trade routes  in such a way that we should be powerless to do  anything unless we could send a  superior naval force, supported by capital ships, to drive the enemy off.  -     50.  There is a great part of the oceans of the world where this applies. Even where a space of sea is actually within range of  aircraft it by no means follows that ships therein will  necessarily be subject to attack.   The  extreme upholders of &quot; The Air  &quot; view will centre one leg of a pair of dividers on an  air base, and with the presumed radius of aircraft will mark out an area into which, they claim, a ship cannot enter without detection and destruction.  That  is a one-sided and specious representation  of the case; the matter is by no means so  simple.  The hours of darkness,  weather, the special training  needed for over-sea navigation and the great areas which aircraft will have to reconnoitre in  order to find their enemy are all  factors which in practice will have great influence. The substitution of aircraft for the capital ship.     51.  It has been argued that the functions of the capital ship can at least equally  well be carried out by aircraft. The defence of our territory and  of our trade routes are, of course, two of  the most important functions of the Navy.  It has been put to us, though not by the Air  Staff, that this can be done by our light naval forces, that our battleships  are unnecessary as cover to those light forces since if  the enemy- possesses battleships they will be destroyed by  our  own air forces, properly distributed in advance to  deal with such a situation.     52.   We  do not consider that the conditions prevailing to-day or  likely  to prevail  in the near future justify these opinions, nor do we consider that there is sufficient evidence to affirm that aircraft can perform the role of our own capital ships by holding in check, and if  possible destroying, enemy capital ships.  We. need ships equal in fighting power  to those of the enemy, for there are large areasof ocean which are out  of - range of service aircraft based on British territory. Of our merchant ships sunk by surface craft during 1914-18 well over half were more than  500 miles from British territory.  Although  the radius  of action of aircraft will increase in the future, the provision all over  the world of sufficient aircraft to deal with all probable contingencies in the defence of  trade  andterritory would necessitate something approaching a two-Power standard  in theair, with an immense provision of facilities of all kinds.
Possibility of attack on harbours and bases.     53.  We have discussed the possibility of heavy  air  attacks carried out against our Fleet  in harbours within range of an enemy&apos;s shore-based aircraft.The Fleet in such circumstances is able to bring to bear its maximum concentra-tion of anti-aircraft fire and the recent naval concentration in Alexandria hasmade the occasion for a serious consideration of  the subject from which usefullessons  can be  learned.  Nevertheless, the prospect of heavy air attacks underthese conditions  is  disquieting and with the ever-increasing  potentialities of aircraft may necessitate the use  of harbours and anchorages  other than thosewhich were suitable in the last war.   In  the same connection we would draw attention to  the increasing liability to  air  attack of naval ports and dockingfacilities.  The latter  are few in number, not easy to defend,  and if damagedcannot  rapidly be replaced.    Yet a capital ship must have full facilities for maintenance  and  repair, and  although our  enquiry  is concerned  with the vulnerability of the ships themselves we think it right to call attention to thenecessity of providing  a full scale of defence for the bases on which capital ships will have to rely in a future war.A ir Power and naval vessels other than Capital Ships.     54.  An interesting feature of the evidence of those who hold that the dayof the capital ship is doomed by reason of its vulnerability to air attack is thatthey do not carry the argument to its logical  conclusion.  The capital ship is muchmore strongly constructed and much better equipped with anti-aircraft guns than any other ship.   Cruisers and light craft  are necessarily far  more  vulnerable;indeed, it can be said that the capital ship is the one remaining surface craftwhich, if hit  severely by an air bomb, is not liable to be sunk.  Yet no partisan ofthe air has  put  forward  the  suggestion that all naval  forces are  doomed todestruction, that the day of navies is over and that air forces can and must takeover the tasks for which the Navy  are now responsible. Yet this is the conclusionwhich properly flows from the arguments which they adduced against the capital ship.The argtoment of relative costs.     55.  No  doubt one reason which has led to the selection of the capital shipfor criticism  is its high cost.   Unofficial  persons have estimated that for the costof one such ship a great number of  aeroplanes could be built; these estimates,sometimes covering only capital cost, sometimes only maintenance and sometimesboth, have varied from 100 to 1,000.  Such  comparisons, however made, are not,in our opinion, -of  any  value or validity, but we thought it  desirable to get at the truth on official calculations.   The Admiralty and Air Ministry have collaboratedin this investigation and have given us an agreed figure  of  43 twin-enginedmedium bombers as the nearest  approximation possible to  the equivalent in costof one  capital  ship, taking into  account all those overhead, maintenance, and replacement and similar charges which should be included to make an effectivecomparison.     56.  We might  mention in passing that one witness who  appeared  beforeus, and used  this financial comparison as part of his  argument,  was asked by usto work out his own estimate of the cost of  providing the number of squadronswhich, according to his ideas, could replace our  capital ships  in their  role ofdefence of trade and territory.   The figure that he arrived at, after a sufficientlycomplex calculation,  and omitting the cost of a large number of new  aerodromesover the Empire, was the same as  the capital cost of 15 capital  ships.     57.  The fact is that the relative costs of battleships and aeroplanes havenot, in themselves, any bearing on the matter.  If capital ships are essential toour security,  we must have them, or go under.  We are dependent, as is no othernation,  on the maintenance of our overseas trade,  we have an Empire sprawlingover the face of the  globe.  We have more to lose by making a  false decision inso vital a matter  than has any other Power.   Yet no other  great Naval  Power,though  with  less  risk  than we ourselves should run, proposes to do  away withcapital ships. Should  we be the first to do so ? Surely not, unless the question issettled beyond all possible doubt. We do not find that the question is so settled.  Itmay never be settled without the test of war, but the information at present at
                                                                          19                 VI.-CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.    58.  We now state the general conclusions which we have  reached oh thematters in question.    The experiments that have taken place have been extensive and prolonged and the information thus obtained has enabled the Admiralty to adapt the design of capital ships in such a way as to offer greater resistance to attack from the air. -Further experiments are, however, essential.   Indeed, we are definitely of opinionthat, as developments in the power and range of aircraft take place, there shouldbe no cessation in making experiments which should reproduce  as far as possiblewar conditions.  To this end the fullest collaboration between the Admiralty andAir Ministry should take place.  We  do not suggest that  anything  has  beenlacking in ingenuity or perseverance in the experiments that have been made, butit is possible that the closer co-operation of the two Services in an attempt to makethe experiments  as realistic as possible would  be fruitful.    59.  We have given full consideration  to the information  already available as a result of the various experiments and it  is plain to us that capital shipscannot be constructed so as to be indestructible by  bombing from the air.   Thiswould  probably  be  true even  if  factors of speed,  armament  and  weight  weredisregarded in the design of the ship so  that the thickness  of the defensivearmour could be indefinitely increased.  If  this fact, which we regard as beingbeyond the possibility of doubt, is kept in mind, it throws light on some of themore extravagant criticisms of the policy of building capital ships.   The criticshave written and spoken as if the issue was between those who deny and thosewho assert the vulnerability of capital ships to air attack.  That is  not the  real question.  In circumstances favourable to an  attack from the air which couldbe driven home by a large and powerful force the most  heavily  armoured capital ship could no doubt be destroyed, or at least seriously crippled.  It is impossibleto do more than speculate as to the chances of such a combination of circumstancesor as to the degree of success  likely to be attained  by the attacking force.   Thereal question that arises on the assumption that capital ships  are indispensableis whether their design is such as to secure  the maximum of immunity from air attack.   We  have, as above stated,  made enquiries in quarters  other  than theAdmiralty as to  whether the capital  ships of His Majesty&apos;s Navy are so designed and we are satisfied  that everything is done  that  experience  could suggest, orskill and money  could provide.    60.  Our recommendations for the future, as contained in the various relevantsections of the Report, are as follows :     (1) Further trials should be carried out  with a view to determining the           possible effect of instantaneously fused bombs on anti-aircraft equip-           ments and their crews (paragraph  12).    (2) We call the attention of  the Admiralty to the suggestion to carry out           experiments against a moving ship in order  to ascertain whether any           special type of damage may be caused to a moving  ship as compared           with  a stationary one (paragraph 14).    (3) The  closest touch should be maintained between the  Admiralty and the           Air Ministry in all experiments connected with the effect of bombs on           ship construction (paragraph 16).    (4) In the experiments to take place in the Autumn, and  in other trials in           this connection, we consider that the provision of  funds and material           should not be allowed to stand in the way (paragraph 17).our disposal leads us to believe that the day of the capital ship is not over, now or in the near future; to assume that it is, and to cease to build them, would leadto grave risk of disaster.    It  is possible  to  state  the  matter in the simplest  possible  terms.  the advocates of  the extreme air view would wish this Country to build no capital ships  (other Powers still continuing to  build them).  If their  theories turn outwell founded, we have  wasted money; if ill founded, we would, in putting themto the test, have lost the Empire.
 (5) We recommend that further experiments should  be carried out, jointly        agreed upon and jointly analysed, to determine certain factors,  at        present  unresolved,  which  affect the  accuracy  of  level  bombing        (paragraph 20). (6) We note that the Staffs have  agreed to co-operate in further trials  to        determine the accuracy of dive bombing (paragraph 22). (7) Queen Bee targets should on occasions be manoeuvred in the manner and        at the height at which air  attack is likely to be carried out in war        (paragraph 30), and the Staffs have agreed to co-operate in the matter        (paragraph 35). (8) When the new bomb sights are available, data should  be obtained as  to        the length of time, necessary for sight-setting, that an aircraft must        fly  on a  straight  course before  dropping a  properly aimed  bomb        (paragraph 32). (9) We commend  to the notice of the interested departments a suggestion        for a mechanical and ballistic experiment to  check the accuracy  of        anti-aircraft fire (paragraph 36).(10) We have no  doubt that the Services will continue to experiment, and  to        co-operate, in the various tactical methods by which attacking aircraft        will seek to gain surprise (paragraph 41).(11) We suggest that the question of ammunition supply and  replenishment        should be re-examined from the point of view of ships operating  in        narrow waters within range of shore-based attack (paragraph 43).(12) We call  attention  to the necessity for adequate air defence of our naval        ports and docking  facilities, on which our capital  ships rely (para-        graph 53).

No special preparation.  No watertight doors in place.         1st attack. 20 x  600 lb. bombs.  15 exploded.   Damage not great no             underwater injury.         2nd attack. 10 x  2,000 lb.  bombs.  No  direct hits, but  several near             misses (one very near). Result was a 5D list after two  hours.         3rd attack-7 x 2,000 lb. bombs.  &quot; Fell at the bow.&quot;  No damage.         4th attack.-3 x 2,000 lb. bombs.  One fell  100 feet off.  One scored a             hit or else fell right alongside.  (One failed to explode.)  Ship sank             in 5 minutes.Target Ship Virginia. Sister ship to New Jersey.         1st attack.-14 x  1,100 lb. bombs.  &quot; Ten were effective &quot;  (presumably             near misses) &quot; at varying distances, principally on starboard side.&quot;             One direct hit.   Ship listed 10 &quot;and sank after 20 minutes.     Ostfriesland. A German battleship built  in 1911.  She was not watertightbefore bombing commenced and  had a list of two degrees, and was a foot deep indraft before the bombing  began.  Bombing continued  for two days.  Duringfirst day 69* bombs, varying from 230 to 2,000  pounds, were dropped and 13 hits were scored.  Little damage was  experienced.   Ship increased list  slightly anddeepened her draft by 3 feet.  No action was taken to stop leaks.     On  the  second day 11 x 1,000 lb. bombs  were  dropped and 3 direct hitsobtained.  The result was no vital injury, but a leak started which caused the ship to settle 3 feet forward and 1 foot aft in 4 hours.     After these 4 hours, 6 x  2,000 lb. bombs were dropped.  No  hits, but  3 near misses, one very close.     Ship sank in 10 minutes, having sustained 16 direct hits from 69 bombs overa period slightly exceeding 24 hours.No. 11 16 16 14148    * The report leaves doubt whether 69 or 52 bombs were dropped on the first day; 52 appears,more probable.
    Apart from the fact the planes were not fired at, had the crew been aboardit is most doubtful whether the cumulative effect of all this bombing would have sunk the ship. If ship had been in commission, bombing would not have preventedcrew from taking steps to stop leaks and pump out.    At a later date U.S.A. carried out a further series of tests of the effect ofunderwater explosions against the  Washington, an uncompleted battleship.    Three 2,000 lb. bombs and two 400 lb. warheads were exploded at the most effective depths under water in contact or close to the  ship&apos;s bottom.  Afterwardsship was inspected and rode out a gale of wind for three days; she had a 50 list.Main condensers were not affected.  Had ship been in commission,  the crew could easily have plugged leaks without use of pumps and kept her on an even keel andfit for service in the line of battle.    The jar of these explosions did not even  put out candles stuck on deck at theend of the ship.  In the end, the ship remained afloat for four days, after sufferingthese  five  explosions, without repairs or pumps.   She was finally sunk by 14 hitsfrom  14-inch gunfire.    The British Admiralty have also carried out extensive trials  both of above-water and under-water explosions of  bombs against  warships.  These tests haveshown  that  from  untamped  explosions   the  ship&apos;s superstructure   sufferssurprisingly little damage.  The result of tests of under-water explosions coincideswith the experience of the U.S.A. trials and with estimates made from previous experience with mines and torpedoes.

The  battleship is the element of  ultimate force in the fleet, and  allother elements are contributory to the fulfilment of its function as the final arbiterin sea warfare.                    w          TV&quot;           vr           *A*           &quot;7V-    268.  From time to time apparent threats to the supremacy of the battleshiphave appeared.  Each has resulted in some modification of its design and in themethods of its employment in war, but its supremacy remains.    269.  With the invention and development of offensive weapons have alwayscome the counter-invention and development of defensive  means and methods, sothat in the end a fair balance is struck between them.  The history of the gunand armour, and of the torpedo and  interior  subdivision, merely repeats theprocess by which offence always begets defence.    270.  Aviation has introduced a new and highly important factor in warfareboth on the land and on  the sea.  It was utilised on an enormous  scale and withgreat effectiveness in land operations during the World War, but did not seriouslyinfluence sea operations.  Its influence on naval warfare undoubtedly will increasein the future, but  the prediction that it will assume paramount importance insea warfare will not be realised.                    *7T          TV           TV                      -iff&quot;    274.

The battleship of to-day,  while not invulnerable to airplane attack, stillpossesses very efficient structural protection, as shown by the experiments on theWashington.  The battleship of the future can be so designed as to distributionof her armour on decks  and sides, and as to  interior subdivision,  that  she willnot be subject to fatal damage from the air.  The effect of plunging long-rangegun projectile hits on a ship&apos;s deck has now become  closely  analogous to theeffect of hits by heavy aerial bombs.  By armouring the battleship &apos;s deck with6 to  7 inches of armour,  we  at  one and  the  same time  effectively meet anypracticable attack from the air and also the attack by gun projectiles fired at thegreatest probable battle ranges.  The interior  subdivision will resist any miningeffect from  aerial bombs.   It  cannot be  said,  therefore,   that air  attack hasrendered the battleship obsolete. .                    *Sf*          *X*           *H*           *X*          ^

(OLD. Paper No. 1258 -B.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by a Sub-Committeeon the Vulnerability of Capital Ships to Air Attack (OLD. Paper No. 1258-B).    Some discussion took place as to the best method to be adopted to make knownto Parliament the conclusions reached by the Sub-Committee, as approved bythe Committee of Imperial Defence.    SIR SAMUEL HO ARE suggested that it was advisable that a White paper should be issued.    It was  generally agreed that the White  Paper should contain as full astatement as possible, but. of course, omitting  anything in the nature of  secret information.    SIR JOHN  SIMON pointed  out that a general  statement could be madestating that various recommendations as to further experiments had been made,but that these would not affect the main  conclusions.  It seemed important toemphasise the misunderstanding which had apparently arisen on the Americanstatements of bomb and battleship trials which had been taken  up by the press and were misleading.    THE CHAIRMAN suggested that in view of the importance of the subject,the Committee might think it desirable to ask the Service Departments to rendera  Report as to  the progress made in  the experiments say after a period of six months.    This was agreed to.    LORD  SWINTON, after referring to recommendation  9 contained in the summary in  paragraph 60 of the Report, said that we wanted as much informationas possible on the question  of mechanical and ballistic experiments to check the accuracy of  anti-aircraft fire.    SIR SAMUEL  HOARE  suggested that it might be desirable that a jointNaval and Air Staff Committee should be set up to carry on the experiments whichwere  recommended.    It was agreed that the  Naval Staff and the Air Staff should arrange the  best method for continuing the work.    SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD raised the question of the effectiveness of anti-aircraft  fire.  He felt that,  quite naturally, the two Service Departments might find it almost impossible to reach agreement.  It was, of course,  realised that noexperiments could make the conditions fully realistic.  He suggested that someimpartial committee  mighT&quot;fr(Td^                          and deductions tobe made from the experiments, and to try to assess what the position would bein, say, five years&apos; time.

 -..........LORD SWINTON said that the Air Staff welcomed this proposal. -  -    MR.  DUFF-COOPER said that the War Office were also interested, and heinstanced the difference of opinion which already existed as to the time duringwhich an aircraft would have to remain on a steady course for aiming purposes.    It was generally thought that scientists would, perhaps, be suitable to act asimpartial judges; the names of Sir Frank Smith and Mr. Tizard were mentioned.It was pointed out,.however, that they were both already very fully occupied.    LORD SWINTON mentioned that it might even be necessary to ask whether mr. Tizard could be relieved for a time of his duties at the Imperial  College of science and Technology.    At the proposal of the CHAIRMAN the Committee agreed that  the paper should be referred for the information of the Cabinet.    The  Chairman  drew the attention of the Committee to recommendation 12in paragraph 60 of  the Report,  regarding the necessity for adequate air defenceof our  naval ports and docking  facilities on  which our capital ships relied.  Hesuggested that the attention of the Home Defence Committee, and possibly other appropriate sub-committees, should be drawn to this matter.                               CONCLUSION.    THE  COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     (a) to approve  the Report  of the Sub-Committee on the Vulnerability of          Capital Ships to Air Attack (OLD. Paper No. 1258-B);    (b) to ask the Minister for  Co-ordination of Defence with the assistance of          Sir Maurice Hankey to prepare  a White Paper  for submission to          Parliament, containing the  conclusions and recommendations  in the          Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 1258-B); this should be as full as possible,          subject to the requirements of secrecy;    (c) that the Naval Staff  and the Air Staff should arrange between them the          best method for  continuing the experiments  recommended in  the          Report with the co-operation of the General Staff in those relating to          anti-aircraft defence.  They should render a statement of progress to          the Committee of Imperial Defence after a period of six months;    (d) that the  Admiralty and Air Ministry (and War Office where concerned)          should co-operate  in the  selection  of impartial witnesses of  the          experiments to be undertaken, who  might  render good  offices  as          assessors in cases  where professional opinion may differ;    (e) to refer the Report of the Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper  No.  1258-B),          together  with the Minutes  of the  Committee  of  Imperial Defence          thereon, to the Cabinet  for information;    (/) to invite  the attention of the  Home Defence Committee and  any  other          sub-committee that may be concerned to Conclusion 12,  paragraph 60,          of the  Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 1258-B) regarding the necessity for          adequate air defence of our Naval ports and docking facilities upon          which  our capital ships rely.          ******2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,     October 8, 1936.
