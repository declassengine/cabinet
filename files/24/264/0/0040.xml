215Printed for the  Cabinet.  October 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 265 (36).CABINET.PROPOSED EMPIRE SETTLEMENT BILL.       (CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.)     THE Empire Settlement Act, 1922, ceases  to be operative on the 31st May,1937, and it is desirable that fresh legislation should be passed before that datenot only to enable the Government to negotiate  with Dominion Governments forcarrying out new  migration schemes,  but also to enable it to continue to maikecontributions towards the cost of schemes already in operation.     As my colleagues are  aware, the depression practically put  an  end  tomigration to the Dominions; indeed, for some years there  has been a balance of migration in the opposite direction. In anticipation of a revival of the movementwhen conditions should again become favourable my predecessor set up an Inter-Departmental Committee under  my chairmanship to make recommendations inthe light of past experience as to the extent and manner in which, if at  all, HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  should, in future, encourage and assist migration from the United Kingdom to the oversea parts of the Empire.The Report of that Committee  was presented to Parliament in August 1934(Cmd. 4689) and was subsequently before the Cabinet (CP.  62 (35)); it was notedthough  not considered  in  detail.  Amongst the important  recommendations were :      (a)  that the United Kingdom Government should only  assist migration when          conditions  are favourable  to satisfactory  settlement and  when  the          Oversea Governments are prepared to receive new migrants, and to          join in the arrangements necessary  to give them a real  prospect  of          success;     (b)  that the financial burden of any assistance should be equitably shared          between the United Kingdom and  the Dominions (that is to say that          in any  scheme which  is being financed by Governments the contribu-          tions of the Governments concerned  should be on a 50/50&apos; basis);     (c) that the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, should be amended so as to allow          the United Kingdom Government to provide up to 75 per cent,  instead          of a fiat rate of 50 per cent, of the necessary cost of the migration          work of approved voluntary organisations;     id)  that an Oversea Settlement Board should be set up to advise the Secretary          of State on specific proposals for schemes of migration within the          Empire and upon any  matter relating to  oversea settlement which          may be  referred  to it  by  him,  and that  a  Central Committee on          Oversea Settlement  should  be   constituted  to  co-ordinate  the          administration of migration policy.     Copies of this Report were sent to the oversea Governments, and the repliesreceived, while guarded and non-committal, expressed general agreement with theconclusions reached.     The Oversea Settlement  Board was  constituted by me in February  1936under the  chairmanship of  Mr.  Douglas Hacking,  who  was  succeeded  byLord Hartington last  March.  It was decided to  defer the appointment of theproposed Central Committee until the; volume of work in  relation to migration      [13984]                                                     B
 justified this.   The Board,  in  the course  of their preliminary  survey  of  the whole problem of migration, have taken a considerable amount of evidence and have also had the advantage of informal discussions with Ministers from overseas who have been visiting England this year.  They  were subsequently invited to consider whether  the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, should be renewed, and, if so, whether its terms should be altered in any way.  In the light of the evidence before them the Board have made  an Interim Report on this  subject, of which a copy is annexed.  They have reached the conclusion that there is some prospect that certain oversea Governments may be prepared to co-operate in schemes for the gradual revival of assisted migration in  the reasonably near future,  and, bearing in mind the early expiry of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, they have &quot; no doubt whatever&quot; that  further legislation should be enacted as scon  as possible to empower the Secretary of State to co-operate in such schemes.iil have no hesitation therefore in recommending that the Empire Settlement Act should be renewed in a suitable form, since without fresh statutory authority it  would not be  possible  for the  Government to  incur any  new  expenditure whatever on migration after May next.     I am  glad to  say that  the Board&apos;s  estimate of the  situation has  had gratifying confirmation in Australia.  During the  visit of Dr. Earle Page and Mr. Menzies to this country  I had opportunities of discussing the subject withfhem,  and  before  they left  I  handed  them an  aide-memoire recording our conversations and indicating certain directions in which it  seemed to me possible that the Commonwealth Government might feel able to consider the resumption of  migration.  I have  now heard from  our High Commissioner that the  Prime Minister has issued a letter to State Premiers containing suggestions for action which are substantially in accord  with  the suggestions  in the  aide-memoire. Briefly, the Commonwealth Government proposes that assisted passages should be granted to young farm workers and women household workers from this country, to . relatives  of  persons already settled  in  Australia, and  to other  would-be migrants possessing capital of not less than   300 in the case of a married man (or an income of  100) or not less than  50 in the case of a single man.  The reactions of the State Governments to these proposals have not  yet been reported to  me officially, though Press telegrams indicate  that the  response will  lack enthusiasm, but I hope, in view of other conversations which I  had with the Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland, while they were here, that there will be at least some  favourable response.  The Commonwealth  Governments letter is at all events notable as the first definite action by any oversea Government to revive assisted migration since the depression.     I have unfortunately no such encouraging intimation  from Canada or New Zealand, but there is a good  deal of evidence that the subject of population is obtaining renewed attention  there,  and I propose to discuss the-prospects with Mr. Walter Nash, the  New  Zealand Finance Minister, when  he is in London next month.  In addition, of course, there is a great deal of interest being shown in the subject in the United Kingdom, both in Parliament and among the public, and constant representations are being made that the Government should  be taking active steps towards getting  the flow of migration restarted. I need not labour my  own view that,  despite many obvious difficulties, the  work of peopling the Dominions with citizens of British stock is amongst the most important tasks that we have to face.     It will not be desirable to reach final decisions on the details of migration policy in  general until the  Oversea Settlement Board have  concluded their preliminary study of the subject and weighed up the evidence received.  The Interim  Report,  however, contains certain  recommendations  which  I  should propose to incorporate in the new Bill.  The main points are :      (1)  The Secretary  of State&apos;s power  to co-operate  should  extend, as  in the           existing Act, to development or land settlement schemes as well as to           schemes  for facilitating migration  by assistance with  passages,           training, &amp;c.     In existing circumstances I think it unlikely that the  Oversea Settlement Board will recommend to me, or  that I shall be able  to approve,  any major scheme of  land settlement or of  development.   The Inter-Departmental  Committee recommended that the policy under which the United Kingdom Government had participated in certain forms of land settlement  should  be discontinued, and
 I am in general agreement  with that recommendation.   However, there is still a large body of opinion, both in Parliament and outside, which thinks of migration in terms of planned group settlement alone, and schemes of the kind have, in fact, already been submitted to the Oversea Settlement Board  for examination.  It is therefore essential, I think, for political reasons if for no  other, that there should be provision for the examination of such schemes and for the participation of the United Kingdom Government in any that may pass the searching tests that will be  applied to them.     (2)  In  schemes  of  development or  land settlement  the  United Kingdom           Governments contribution to the cost should not exceed 50 per cent.     This is  in accordance  with the existing Act.  As  regards other  schemes financed by Governments, it will be seen from paragraph 11 of the Board&apos;s Report that they felt that a rigid adherence to the 50-50 principle in co-operating with oversea  Governments might  make it impossible in certain cases to give effect to schemes which were otherwise desirable.  I feel, however, that it is  essential to avoid encouraging the impression, especially amongst the critical and some- times hostile public of the Dominions (who charge us with seeking to &apos;&apos; dump &apos;&apos; our  unemployed in the  Dominions)  that migration is of greater  advantage to the Mother  Country than to the Dominions.  I therefore think that in regard to schemes  in which an oversea Government is  the  only other partner,  the maximum contribution of the United Kingdom Government should, as in  the past, be fixed at 50 per cent, -of the cost.   I have caused the Board to be informed of my view on this point and they are prepared to accept it.                            -     (3)  In schemes other than schemes of development or land settlement, i.e.,          schemes for passage assistance, training, &amp;e, where the partner of the          United Kingdom  Government  is an organisation financed otherwise          than from Government funds,  the Government should be empowered          to contribute up to 75 per cent, of the cost, provided that the Secretary          of State is satisfied that the organisation reaches a sufficient standard          of efficiency.     This is a departure  from the existing Act, under which the United Kingdom Governments contribution can in no case exceed 50 per cent, of the cost.  It is in accordance with the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee, which found that the migration  work of the unofficial organisations, such as the Salvation Army and the Big Brother Movement, was of  high value, but that it- was  cramped by lack of funds.   I anticipate that the more liberal measure  of assistance proposed will  add materially to the results obtained by these voluntary bodies.     (4)  The Board  find  it impossible to suggest any maximum figure for major          schemes  of development or land settlement, should any such receive          approval; but they suggest that a maximum of  1,500,000 per annum          should be placed upon contributions in respect of other schemes.     The existing Act provides for an annual maximum expenditure of  3 million by the Secretary  of State  on schemes  of all  kinds.   Owing to a  shortage ofacceptable schemes the actual exjoenditure in any one year has never reached half that amount, and I feel  that in  existing circumstances the insertion in  the newBill of any such maximum as  3 million would be entirely misleading and lay the Government open  to the accusation, of which much was heard in past years, thatthere was a large accumulating  fund which they refused or neglected to spend.I therefore propose, with the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, thatthe maximum annual expenditure should be  1,500,000 for schemes of all kinds,and that, in introducing the Bill,  I should inform Parliament that, if the  Govern-ment wish to participate  in any major scheme of development or land settlement the cost of which would  involve an  excess over the financial limit proposed (a contingency which I may say that I regard as improbable) they would introduce an amending Bill at  the earliest convenient opportunity.  I  am glad to say that Ihave an  assurance from the Oversea Settlement Board that, on the assumption that such a statement is: made to Parliament, they regard this solution of theproblem as satisfactory.      [13984]                                                    B  2
    (5) The Secretary of State should be empowered to enter into commitments           covering a period of fifteen years.    This is the period covered by the expiring Act, and I agree that it should be repeated.    I should be glad if  my colleagues would authorise me to proceed with thepreparation of a Bill on the lines I have indicated for submission to the HomeAffairs  Committee.  It is important that the Bill should be introduced before christmas  in order to  ensure its enactment early next year before the expiry ofthe existing Act.

ANNEX. (Confidential.)                   OVERSEA SETTLEMENT  BOARD.                          FIRST  INTERIM  REPORT.               (Covering the period February 1936-July 1936.)                                 Members :         The Marquess of Hartington, M.P. (Chairman).         Mr. E. G. Machtig,  C.M.G.,  O.B.E.         Mr. A. P. Waterfield, OB.         The Dowager Marchioness of Reading.         Dr. W. G. S. Adams, C.H.         Mr. George Gibson.         Mr. H. J. Mitchell.         Brigadier-General J. J. H. Nation, C.V.O., D.S.O.             Mr. G. F. Plant, C.B.E. (Secretary).             Mr. C. R. Price (Assistant Secretary). To the Secretary of State         for Dominion Affairs, Sir,    &quot;WE were appointed as the  Oversea  Settlement Board in February 1936, in accordance  with one of the recommendations in  the  Report of the  Inter- Departmental Committee on  Migration Policy (Cmd. 4689).  The Terms of Reference of the Board were &quot; to consider and advise the Secretary of State upon specific proposals  for schemes of  migration within  the Empire and upon any matter relating to oversea settlement which  may be referred to it by him.&quot;    2.  We have now held fourteen meetings.  We  have  had the advantage of hearing  the views of certain Ministers from overseas,  the  United  Kingdom High Commissioner  in  Canada  and  the  late United  Kingdom Government Representative  in Australia, as well as of representatives of voluntary migration organisations and private individuals interested in oversea settlement.  We have also had before  us three land settlement schemes, namely, a general scheme for the redistribution of  the population  of  the Empire drawn - up by the Empire Development and  Settlement  Research Committee,  usually referred to as the Page-Croft  scheme; the  Canadian scheme advocated by General Hornby,  and a scheme for settlement in Manitoba advocated  by the Empire Migration Settlement Group.   On these  we shall report  to you in  due course.   We have also received within the last  few days  a memorandum by the Premier of New South Wales on Australian Development.    3.  On  a preliminary view of  the situation we are encouraged to think that the improvement of economic conditions overseas and the evidence that, for various reasons, the idea of  Empire  migration is being viewed with growing favour in the Dominions, point  to the probability  that certain oversea  Govern- ments may be prepared to co-operate in schemes for the gradual revival of assistedmigration along certain  lines in the reasonably near future.  We are activelypursuing our enquiries in this direction.    4.  Meanwhile, however,  it has been pointed out to us that, for  constitutional reasons, it will not be possible, without fresh statutory authority, for the Secretaryof State to enter into any agreements involving commitments beyond the 31st May, 1937, when the Empire  Settlement Act, 1922,  is  due to expire.  We  have accordingly  been invited  to consider and advise the Secretary of State whetherthe current Act  should be renewed, with or without amendment.
      5.  On the main question we  have no doubt whatever that it would be desirable  that legislation should be  enacted as soon as possible to empower the Secretary of State to co-operate in agreed schemes for the settlement of suitable persons from the United  Kingdom within the Empire overseas.      6..  The precise form  which  this  legislation should&apos;&quot; take  is  a question involving  considerations  of policy and parliamentary procedure on which we do not feel competent to advise.  We content ourselves, therefore, with the following observations, which we trust will be of assistance to His Majesty&apos;s Government in reaching a decision.                         I. Scope of the proposed Bill.      7.  The existing Act empowers the Secretary  of State to contribute towards the cost of &quot; agreed schemes,&quot; which are defined as follows :       (a)  a  development or a land settlement scheme;      (b)  a  scheme for facilitating settlement in or  migration to any part of His           Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions, by  assistance  with  passages,  initial           allowances, training or otherwise.      8.  We trust that, if the difficulty as to financial procedure to which we draw attention in paragraph 15 below  can be  overcome, this part of the existing Act may be renewed.   It is true that opportunities for a renewed migration movement in the near  future,  on the lines referred to in paragraph 3 above, would arise under schemes in the second of these categories (b); and that, as regards schemes in the first category  (a),  we have  not yet had time to reach definite conclusions. While we note  that the Interdepartmental  Committee  on Migration Policy (Cmd. 4689) reported against further participation in schemes of land settlement (save possibly under exceptional  conditions) we consider  that  the inclusion of sub-paragraph (a) in the  proposed Bill is necessary in order that we may be in a position to complete our  examination of the schemes already before  us, and to advise the Secretary of  State on any specific schemes of development or land settlement which may be submitted to us hereafter.           II. Limitation of the Secretary of State&apos;s Contribution.     9.   We  endorse the  recommendation of the  Interdepartmental  Committee that  the United  Kingdom  Government should not  in   any circumstances  be required to contribute more than an equitable share of  the cost  of  an  agreed scheme.  Where the partner in the scheme is an organisation financed otherwise than from Government  funds,  we recommend that it  should  be open  to the Secretary of State to contribute, if he thinks fit, up to 75 per cent, of the cost. We do not, of course, imply that his contribution  should  be 75 per cent,  in  all cases; we assume that proviso (a.) to section 1  (3) in the existing Act will  be retained, under which the Treasury are  to be satisfied that the  contributions of the other party bears a proper relation to that of the Secretary of  State in each case.     10.  In the case  of schemes of development or land settlement, however, we &apos; think that the principle of equal participation is of such importance as to justify restriction  of the United  Kingdom Governments contribution to 50 per cent,  in any case, whether the partner  in the scheme  is  a Government  or  a private organisation.    11.  As  regards  other schemes in which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom may be  associated with the Government  of any other part  ofHis Majesty&apos;s dominions, we are disposed on grounds of principle  to favour restriction  of the Secretary of State&apos;s contribution to a maximum of 50 per cent.of the cost.   But we are obliged to admit that rigid adherence to this principlemay make it  difficult, if not impossible, to give effect to schemes for facilitatingmigration which  on other grounds might be thought desirable.   Here again it appears to  us that considerations of general policy  are involved; and we refraintherefore from making any specific recommendation.
218  Ill-Limitation of Expenditure from Public Funds in any Financial Year.    12.  Under the existing Act expenditure from public funds in any financialyear may not exceed  3 millions, exclusive of the amount of any sums received byWay of interest on,  or  repayment of  advances previously made.  In  practiceexpenditure has never reached even one half of this amount; the maximum in the peak year (1927) was only  1,280,000, and the average expenditure from 1923 tothe beginning of  the  depression (1929) rather more than  800,000 per annum.The following table shows the  gross actual expenditure during the three peakyears, 1926-28, upon schemes in categories (a) and (b) separately, with the numberof persons assisted in each year :                             (a) Schemes (Land    (b) Schemes &apos;                              Settlement and    (Passage Allow-       Total                              Development).      ances, &amp;c.)       Number of                                   g                      Persons assisted.        1926  .........    402,000         727,000         65,544        1927  .........    550,000         732.000         60,917        1928  .........    557,000         582,000         47,856                 Average  ...     503,000        680,000         58,105During the years 1933, 1934, 1935, in  which migration from this country had declined to negligible proportions, the total expenditure under categories (a) and(b) was  78,000,   39,000 and  31,000 respectively.     13.  The Interdepartmental Committee in paragraph 193 of their Reportestimated that,  allowing  for an increase in the State&apos;s contribution up to  amaximum of 75 per cent, of the cost, on the same conditions as we propose, the costof  assisting  100,000  persons (that is,  a  number nearly twice as large as  theaverage annual number assisted over the three peak years before the depression)to  migrate  in any year  under schemes  falling  under  category (6)  would be approximately  1,100,000.     14.  In  the circumstances, we suggest that a limit of  1,500,000  should beinserted in the Bill to cover expenditure on schemes in category (b) and any minorschemes  in category (a).     15.  As regards  the  cost  of  major  schemes in category  (a) we find it quite impossible to suggest any total figure which should be based upon practical considerations.  If power  is sought in the forthcoming Bill for the  Secretaryof State to participate in schemes such as the Page-Croft or the Hornby Schemes,the limit of authorised expenditure in any one year might have to be increasedto  3  millions or even more.  Even so  the  figure would be largely a  matter ofguesswork, so that it would be difficult to give Parliament the financial informa-tion which they  are entitled to require before authorising expenditure on a new statutory service.                 IV. Period  of  Operation of the New Bill.     16.  The existing Act was given a  life, of 15 years; and we recommend that under  the new Bill  the Secretary of State should be empowered to enter into agreements over  the  same period,  that is until 1952.   While we can readilyconceive that fresh legislation  on the subject of Empire Settlement  may berequired before that date, we are satisfied that unless the Secretary of  State hasthe right to  enter into commitments covering a considerable  number  of  years ahead, organisations  such as the Fairbridge Farm  Schools, whose  settlementschemes involve heavy capital expenditure, will find their opportunities for useful work seriously restricted.                                V. General.    17.  We would add that in our opinion it would be very helpful, if legislation is decided upon, that an immediate announcement should be made by the Govern-ment on the  subject,  pending the introduction of the Bill into Parliament.                            &apos;   (Signed)      HARTINGTON (Chairman).    (Signed)        G. F.  PLANT (Secretary).    July 1936.
