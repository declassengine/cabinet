THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1936.SECRET.                                                        Copy-No.   42CP. 239 (36).CABINET.PALESTINE SITUATION.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I  CIRCULATE,  for  the  consideration of my colleagues, the attached memorandum regarding the proposal to proclaim martial law in Palestine.    2.   I understand  that the  views  expressed in the memorandum  do not commend themselves to the War Office and Air Ministry.                                               (Initialled)      W. O. G.    Colonial  Office, Downing  Street,          September 15, 1936.                              MEMORANDUM.              Proposal to Proclaim Martial Law in Palestine.    1.  At their meeting on the 2nd September one of the conclusions reached by the Cabinet was as follows :          &apos;&apos; That intensive measures designed to  crush Arab resistance should be    taken and that for this purpose the troops in Palestine should be reinforced    by a complete  Division sent from home and that at an appropriate moment    martial law should be applied either to the  whole of Palestine or to selected    parts thereof.&quot;    2.  I understand that it  is the view of the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff  that, having  regard to experience in  Ireland in 1920-21,  any declarationof martial law in Palestine  should apply  to  the whole  country.   The HighCommissioner  agrees with this view, which I fully accept.    3.  When the  conclusion of the Cabinet, on  this point was communicated tothe High Commissioner, he sent a telegram, dated the 4th September, in whichthe question is raised as to the position of  the  High Court in Palestine on thedeclaration of  martial law, and in which the High Commissioner asks for adviceas to  what steps, if any, could be taken to avoid the  possibility  of the necessityfor the application of martial law in Palestine being argued before  the Court.    4.  On the 6th September the High  Commissioner sent me a further telegramraising the question of his relations as High Commissioner with the Administratorof Martial Law on martial law being.proclaimed,  and discussing various questions connected therewith.  . Copies  of these two  telegrams form Appendix I  to thismemorandum.   In  Appendix  II will be found  a memorandum  which has beenprepared by my Legal  Adviser on  the  subject of  martial  law,  and dealingparticularly with the question of the position of the  Courts under martial law.In Appendix III will be  found a letter  from  the Attorney-General, to  whomthese&quot; papers were referred.      [13792]                                                     B
     5.&quot; As  regards the  relations  of.  the  High  Commissioner, with  the Administrator of Martial Law, the view held at the War Office is understood to be  that if and when martial law  is proclaimed in Palestine, the  effect will be that  the  High Commissioner will then  perform only  such functions  as the Administrator of Martial Law  does  not  elect himself  to  assume.   As will be seen from the High Commissioner^ telegram  of the 6th September&apos;Sir Arthur Wauchdpe inclines to the view that it would be  difficult to reserve certain subjects to remain under the control of the High Commissioner:&quot;If this view1 is accepted, it would appear  to  follow that the Administrator of &quot;Martial Law will become responsible for  all  the functions  of  civil government,  although he would, in practice, intervene only as regards matters which he considered affected measures for the suppression of  disorder.     6.  It seems probable that if  martial law is  applied throughout Palestine, it will also have to be applied  simultaneously throughout Trans-Jordan.  As regards its application to  Trans-Jordan, the High Commissioner has no executive authority in Trans-Jordan, which possesses an independent  Government  under the rule of the Amir, and  the relations between the  Government of Trans-Jordan and His Majesty&apos;s  Government are regulated by an Agreement  between  His Majesty and the Amir which  contains provisions to enable His Majesty to fulfil his international obligations  in respect of Trans-Jordan.    By article 14 of this Agreement, the Amir agrees to follow the advice  of His Majesty in regard to the application of martial law in all or any part of Trans- Jordan, and to entrust its administration to such officer or officers of His Majesty&apos;s Forces  as  His Majesty  may nominate.    His Highness also agrees, on  the re-establishment of civil government, to the adoption of a special law to indemnify the armed forces for all acts  done or omissions or  defaults made under martial law.    7.  Having regard to the difficulties referred to in paragraphs 3 to 5 above, and to the fact that  it cannot  be said that matters have reached a stage at  which the civil Power in Palestine is unable to continue its functions indeed, the very considerable volume of correspondence on  normal  administrative matters which continues  to pass between the Colonial Office and the High Commissioner is an indication  of its  continued activity I thought it  desirable to arrange for the possibility to be explored,  in consultation with  representatives of the War  Office and the Air Ministry, of finding means whereby without  a resort to martial law,the High Commissioner could&apos; be given  all the legal powers necessary, in so far ashe did not possess them already, to enable disorder to be suppressed by the armed forces of the Crown.  As it is understood that in any case Lieutenant-General Dill would  not wish that martial law  should  be  proclaimed until  the additionalDivision of Troops has arrived in Palestine, which should be about the beginningof October, there should be time, if any further legal powers are necessary, forsteps to be taken to provide them beforehand either by local Ordinance, Regula-tions under the Palestine (Defence) Order-in-Council,  1931,  or an amendmentof the Order-in-Council itself.    8.  In the course of discussion it was pointed out that if the measureshitherto taken had failed  to restore order it could not be said that  this was  dueto any inability to confer  adequate powers upon the High Commissioner,  as theexisting powers conferred upon him by the Defence Order in Council had notyet been used to their full extent,  and the High Commissioner had not so farasked  for  any  additional powers.  As regards the Courts,  if  there  are anylegitimate complaints with regard to the  slowness  of their procedure or  to the inadequacy of&apos;the sentences passed for offences arising out of the disorders, itwas pointed out that the High Commissioner has power under  the Defence Order in Council to transfer the trial of offences  against regulations under  that  Order,to Courts Martial which would be able to award the death penalty  if an offencewere committed with the intention of assisting the enemy.   It was further pointedout that if the powers conferred on the High Commissioner in this  respect were considered unsatisfactory, they could be altered or extended  by an amendment to the Order in Council.     ..................    9.   The view held by representatives of the War Office and the Air ministry is. I understand, that such a  procedure would  not  be elastic enough and wouldgive no assurance that the Military Authorities would be able to act with  the
promptitude which would be possible under a martial law regime.  As regards  ^the;possibility;of any. interference by the civil courts, the War Office yiew-isr, Iunderstand^ that, the Administrator of Martial Law could safely be left to deal effectively with any difficulties which might arise.  It was. further urged that,however much bitterness on  the  part of the civil population might be evokedunder a martial law regime, the use of force, if sufficiently severe to be effective,must in any case tend! to arouse bitter feelings, and a martial law regime would at least have,the advantage that  the odium of suppression would.fall  Upon the armed forces of the Crown,  and that when order had been  restored the  HighCommissioner would be able  to resume control of  the civil administration  in an atmosphere more propitious  to good relations than if he had been  regarded asbearing the responsibility for all that was done during the period of  suppression.    10.  In all the circumstances I shall be glad  of the views of my colleagues as to (1) whether they consider that the question of the proclamation of martial law in Palestine should be further considered before a final decision  is taken,(2) if it is considered that no further consideration  is called for and that it shouldbe left to Lieutenant-General Dill to ask the High  Commissioner  to  proclaimmartial law at whatever date is considered appropriate,  whether  the view is tobe accepted that on the proclamation of martial law the High Commissioner, whois the King&apos;s Representative  in Palestine, should place himself in subordinationof the  General Officer Commanding the Troops.                                                (Initialled)       W. 0: G..    Colonial Office, Downing Street,          September 15, 1936.                                            &apos; &apos;\APPENDIX  I.                                     (i)      Telegram from High Commissioner, No. 684 of September 4, 1936.  &apos;r    No! 684.  Secret.  &apos;  Your telegram No. 454.   These is some doubt as to position of the High Courton declaration of martial law.  I am advised that, so long as the High Court isin existence and able  to sit, the necessity for martial law of partial ortptaiapplication might be challenged before the High Court.   It will be appreciated that no  adequate  library  is  available to  my  advisers,  but  they  refer:  toEnglish and Empire Digest,  volume 11,  page 536, paragraph 386,  Rex v. Eyre;Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England, 1935, supplement (to), volume VI,; paragraph 609,Martial Law;  Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition,  volume 14, page  984,martial and common law.  Question has been raised with Deputy Judge Advocate-General,  who has  consulted the Judge Advocate-General.   The  opinion  is expressed by Judge Advocate-General that, if martial law. is, pf general appli-cation, the military commander could  prevent  the matter being brought beforethe Court,  but if martial law is  only of partial application,,/the Court couldenquire into  necessity  for its application.  Whatever the legal result :brbfectmight be, I am of the opinion that it is most undesirable that, any question&quot;:asi tothe necessity for the total or partial  application of.  martial- law in palestine should be argued, before the  Court.  I should be grateful Tor/youiv-adyice as tothe, position and-what,steps, if any, hould be taken to avoid.this, formality, t.
I&apos;            1   &quot;Z&apos;&apos;      &apos;(ii)  -       L                           1       Telegram from High Commissioner, No. 695 of September 6, 1936. .    IMMEDIATE.    No.  695.  Secret,                                 ....  -:  I  am in considerable doubt as to what will be my position in relation to Dillwhen martial  law is declared, and as to the extent to which the  civil administra-tion in all its.branches will be directly  subject to his control as Administratorof martial law.    2.  Normally, I imagine that Dill would report direct to the War Office; butI presume I am right in thinking that you will continue to exercise control overall ordinary matters of administration and legislation in Palestine, certainly thosewhich will affect the future as well as  the  present, and that you may wish toexercise this control through me rather than  through Dill.   If I continue to dealwith questions of. future policy and with current matters of administration. notconnected  with  the  present  disorders or their  suppression,  I  necessarily  shall require the services  of many officers of the Civil administration, although imagine  that Dill  will  necessarily have  first  call  at least  for police  and communications.  It  is clear  also that I shall need some staff  in Palestine for administration of Trans Jordan.    3.  It is therefore necessary for me to have your instructions as to how faryou wish me to divest myself of my powers as High Commissioner, and I shall be grateful if these are sent telegraphically  before  11th September,  when  Dillarrives.    4.  After a conversation with Deputy Judge Advocate-General, Middle East,I (? group omitted: understand that) under certain circumstances  difficulties might arise if civil administration is not placed entirely under martial law.   The judge advocate-General is of opinion that either the Administrator of martial law orthe civil power must be supreme.    5.  If the Administrator is  given  supreme control, this would  entail all departments coming directly under  the control of the Administrator and allHeads of Departments taking orders  from him.   The High  Commissioner would consequently have no further  concern in the  administration &quot;of the legislation ofPalestine,  though he would remain High  Commissioner of  Trans Jordan unless otherwise arranged.    6.   As example of subjects with which  you may wish me to deal  after thedeclaration of Martial  Law, I  instance the  following :   Royal Commission,Current   and   next  year&apos;s  Estimates,  immigration,   and  labour   schedules,development projects, municipal administration.    7.  It is clear to me, on the other hand, that the Inspector-General of Policewholly, and General Manager of Railways, Postmaster-General and Director ofPublic Works  at least for all operation purposes, would necessarily come under thecontrol of the  Administrator of Martial Law, and I presume financial  control ofall matters connected directly or indirectly with security would rest with  him.Neither the Deputy Judge Advocate-General nor  I myself  have any  practical experience of  martial law, but he  feels that  to ensure smooth working whole ofthe Palestinian  Government Administration should be  vested in the Adminis-trator  of Martial Law.  All the officers  of the Palestine Administration wouldthen receive their orders direct from the Administrator without reference to theHigh Commissioner, and the Administrator would presumably report to the  WarOffice.   . 8.  J think that it would be difficult when preparing declaration of martial law to reserve certain subjects to remain under the control of the High Commis-siouer.  I  consider  solution once suggested  that I  should be Administrator of martial  Law  would  be  altogether wrong.   I am  Certain  that Deputy judge advocate-General, (sic) (? Dill) must be the Administrator. .v   &apos;  .     :- ;    9.   On the other hand, a solution might be found, as suggested by DeputyJudge  Advocate-General, in placing Chief  Secretary directly  under  Adniinis-tratof, and making him responsible for  working of civil departments as when
High Commissioner is out of Palestine.  This would leave Trans-Jordan withouta High  Commissioner  unless  you felt  that Chief  Secretary  can legally  and practically carry out both roles simultaneously, and in these rather, difficult daysahead of us you may  desire my advice, especially on those subjects mentioned inparagraph 6-above.    10.  The Deputy Judge Advocate-General suggests,  and, subject to yourapproval, I agree, that existing Civil Courts should continue to  function afterMartial Law has been declared, in Order  to deaf with cases not arising out of thepresent disturbances.   Officers with legal training  are, I understand, now being sent to Palestine, and by means of these officers Military Courts will be set Up invarious parts of country to deal with&apos; all cases not requiring  sentences of over twoyears&apos; imprisonment.   A Senior Court-Martial is to be formed in Jerusalem todeal with more serious offences,  including  death  sentence, which, before beingcarried out, would be  referred to the Administrator.    I asked the Deputy Judge Advocate-General whether the Administrator orHigh Commissioner would confirm or exercise clemency on death sentences passedby the Civil Courts.   (? He) suggested that Administrator  should be empoweredto do  so.APPENDIX  II.  Memorandum by Legal Adviser to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    MARTIAL Law in its original sense simply meant the law applying to themilitary forces of the Crown.    It is a great pity that it has since been used in quite a different sense.  Inthe context in which we are considering it the expression has no precise meaning.There is no power in the King or anyone else to establish &quot; Martial Law.&quot;  no attempt  to do so has been known in England since the time of the Stuarts.  Allthat the expression means to-day is the assumption by the officers of the Crownof absolute power exercised by military forces for the suppression of an insurrec-tion and the  restoration of law and order.  It is, of course, legal for the crown and its officers to suppress an insurrection, and  acts reasonably done to that endcan be justified in law, but when you go further  and purport to govern a country by military proclamations and by military tribunals jrou get beyond what is legal and you  must rely upon an Act of Indemnity for protection  for such acts.  Diceygoes so  far as to  say that  an  execution by a court-martial  acting under such circumstances is technically murder.    The Courts,  I feel  clear, cannot  declare generally that  the application of martial  Law is ineffective or improper.  What the controversy  about the Courtsreally means  is this : Can they, assuming they  continue to sit, interfere in anyparticular case with the action of the military authorities ?    I think the law on the subject is now pretty clear.  In the case of ex yarteD. F. Marais, 1902 Appeal Cases, the Privy Council decided that where actualwar is raging, acts done by the military authorities are not justiciable by theordinary tribunals.  This decision, however, must not be given a wider meaningthan it possesses.  In that case the Court was satisfied that actual war was raging,and there is nothing in the case which questions the right of a Court to decide the fact whether war is raging.   The Irish Cases of 1921 and 1923 make theposition  plainer.  In the cases of The King v. Allen and the King  v. Strickland,both reported in  the 1921  Irish Reports, Vol. 2, the question was whether theCourts  would  issue a writ of Habeas  Corpus  in relation to rebels held andconvicted by Courts merely purporting  to act under Martial law.   In each case theCourts first of all  considered  whether there was a  Avar existing,  and for thatpurpose  they looked at affidavits by the military authorities  on the one hand andby various other persons on the; other hand, and they decided that war was actually in existence; and, following Marais case, that therefore they could not interfere. -    If,  therefore,  martial law is proclaimed in. Palestine, it-will be open to theCourts;  if  any. application is, made to. them.in any -particular., case, to decide whether  the existing state of  affairs&apos; there amounts to levying war against theKing.  If they decide that it does, they should  decline to intervene. . If, on theother hand, they decide  that the disturbances do riot amount to that, then they
wHl be entitled                                           ease of Wolfe.:Tone.tii Marais&apos;.s case the Privy Council,expressly said that cases of difficulty would.arise when the fact of a state of rebellion or insurrection is not clearly established,and indicated that, where it was a question of a mere riot or disturbance as notto amount to war at all, the intervention of a military force might be held to be unnecessary. .                                              .           [\..  .....    Having regard to the very extensive emergency powers already possessed bythe High Commissioner (including  the power to  have offenders tried by  courts martial), and the ease with which he could be given any further powers required,I do not quite see what advantage is expected from a&apos;resort to Martial Taw,which  is unusual where the Civil Power  is still capable of functioning.  Therehas been no attempt to declare martial law  in this country since the time of theStuarts,  not even in 1715 or  1745, and its application in the  Colonies has morethan once led to grave  abuses,  e.g., British Guiana and Jamaica.    Lastly, I do not know what, under the regime of  Martial Law, would be theposition  of the Courts.  One would expect, if martial law was necessary,  thatthey should have ceased  to  function,  or that they  would be  doing so underdifficulties -which is  not the  case.  In Marais&apos;s  case it was said  that the factthat for some purposes some Courts pursued their ordinary course is not conclusivethat war is not  raging, and in the case of Erskin Childers, 1923 Irish Reports,Vol. 1, it was said that if the Courts were  open and freely functioning as in times of peace, that would go largely to show that there was not really a state of war,and the Judge in that case then goes on to point out that the Law Courts in dublin had been burnt to the  ground,  that the Court  in which he sat could onlysit with  the protection of a military  guard, that the circuits could not be  held and that the Courts were merely struggling for existence in the state of war whichhe was satisfied was prevailing.                                                (Initialled)       H. G. B.    September 9,  1936,APPENDIX III.          Letter from Attorney-General, dated September 11, 1936.                                          Royal Courts of Justice, London,Dear Bushe,                                      September 11, 1936.    I  HAVE  read  the  papers  which  you left  with  me,  particularly theMemorandum on martial law.  I agree with what is  stated in paragraph  15 of chapter 1 of the Manual on Military Law, namely, that there is great confusionattaching to the use of this term, and I am not clear as to the sense in which it is used in the Cabinet Conclusion of the 2nd September.    No  doubt under theordinary Common law in times of rebellion powers may be assumed by the Crownacting through its military forces provided that such.powers are necessary forthe maintenance of good order.  As is pointed out in the paragraph of the Manualon Military Law already cited, the right to exercise such powers  depends on theactual  circumstances  and  not on  any proclamation which  may  be made, suchproclamation of itself in no degree suspending the ordinary law except in so faras the  facts justify the use of the exceptional power.  This, as Dicey points outin the chapter dealing with this subject in his Law of the Constitution, is the onlysense in which martial law is known to English Law.  If it is desired to give themilitary authorities further power or power independent of the common law basisthis must be  done by legislation or by some ordinance having legislative force.I  understood  from you that under  the existing  Order-in-Council the  HighCommissioner has power to delegate authority to courts-martial or military courts for dealing with offences which it is thought proper should be so dealt with.   This,I should have thought, is the proper procedure to be used.    It would, I should have thought, be wholly foreign  to our law and our methods to hand over the whole administration to  the military, leaving it to them to delegate back certain powers to the High Commissioner.  If it is desired  to go beyond the common law right I should have thought the procedure must necessarily be the  delegation by the civil authorities of any powers thought necessary.
   :; With regard to the rights of the courts to intervene when martial law,  asknown to English Law, is proclaimed, I&apos;have had my attention drawn to a LawOfficers-  Opinion given in 1900 with regard to a case which occurred in Natal.In that Opinion the Law Officers  took the view that the Supreme Court of Natalwas entitled to enquire, on an application for a writ of habeas Corpus, whethercircumstances  existed justifying  the use of force in the interests of the public safety and whether the force used  was in excess of what was reasonably necessary.    You will appreciate&apos; that this is only a tentative expression of opinion, butit certainly seems to me that the matter is one which requires careful considerationfrom the constitutional aspect.
