GUARANTEE WITH REGARD TO IMPORTS OF MUTTON AND IAMB.         Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.    I  CIRCULATE  for the  consideration  of  my  colleagues  the attached memorandum, which expresses the views of the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Scotland and myself, on a question which has arisen in the course ofthe negotiations with  the Argentine  delegation on  the proposed new  Anglo-Argentine Commercial Agreement.    The Secretary of State  for Dominion Affairs is also in general agreementwith the memorandum and  has concurred in the paragraphs relating to theDominions.                                                               W. E. E.    Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,               October 23, 1936.Statement prepared by the A agricultural Departments in consultation with the                            Dominions Office.    The  Argentine  delegation have  requested,  as  a  condition  of the new agreement now under discussion, a guarantee that imports of mutton and lambfrom Argentina into the United Kingdom  will not be further reduced duringthe currency of the Agreement,  viz., during the years 1937, 1938 and  1939.    2.   The President of the Board of Trade is of opinion that in principle therequest  for a  quantitative  guarantee is  reasonable  and that in practice  aguarantee that Argentine imports would  not be cut  by  more than  a further10  per cent,  could  be  given.   Such  an offer has in  fact  been made to theArgentine delegation, but has not, so  far, been accepted by them.    3.   The  Minister  of Agriculture and  Fisheries,  and  the parliamentary under-Secretary of  State for  Scotland,  feel  that  the  consequences of  any limitation of the complete discretion  of the United Kingdom Government toregulate imports of mutton and lamb in 1938 and 1939 may be  serious, and they wish to draw the attention of their colleagues to the full implications of thisproposal before a decision is finally taken.    4.   There has been,  and there still is, strong pressure for provision  to bemade in the  Governments long-term  live-stock policy  for a duty  on importedmutton and lamb and for arrangements which would enable a subsidy to be paidto sheep producers should the need arise.  This  pressure has been resisted onthe grounds that quantitative regulation has maintained healthy conditions in theUnited  Kingdom mutton and lamb market in the past  three years and that      [13982]
 the Government proposes to continue to safeguard the home industry in this way and to take adequate powers for this purpose in the forthcoming legislation.     5.  If, when this  legislation is before Parliament,  it is known  that  the Government have not only entered into undertakings with the Dominions and foreign countries that no duty on imported mutton and lamb will be imposed, but have also voluntarily accepted a limitation for the next three years of their powers of exercising quantitative control, doubts will be thrown on the bona fides of their promise to safeguard the home industry and the pressure for subsidy provisions in the new legislation will be intensified.     6.  It  should be  borne  in  mind  that  the proposed  new Anglo-Argentine Agreement will also limit the duty to be imposed on imports of beef from Argen- tina to frf.  per lb. on chilled beef, with corresponding duties on other descriptions, and will include quantitative guarantees with regard to imports of frozen and chilled beef from that country.  The United Kingdom  Government will undertake that no further  cut will be imposed during the currency  of  the Agreement on imports of  frozen beef from Argentina and that imports of chilled beef from Argentina  will not be reduced by more than 5 per cent.  The Government will, in any case, be criticised for having thus relinquished  in advance the right in an emergency  to exercise to the full the  powers to regulate imports which they have announced their intention of seeking from Parliament as part of their long-term live-stock policy.     7.  The proposed guarantee with regard to mutton and  lamb imports  will lead to difficulties with the Dominions.  A recovery in home production of mutton and  lamb has already started.  If this continues in the manner anticipated and if Dominion imports continue on the present scale, there is every prospect of an over-supplied market, resulting  in  a serious  deterioration of prices.    The Dominions  (in particular, Australia)  have in the past  few years enjoyed a considerable expansion of  their trade.  They have indicated that they expect this  to continue.  In the recent discussions  between Dr.  Earle Page  and Mr.  MacDonald, the Dominions Secretary warned Dr.  Page about the increasing juoduction  of home  supplies of mutton and lamb,   that  the  chances of the Dominions being allowed any further  expansion were therefore slight and that we might  even have to propose some reduction in their imports.  Nevertheless, a  reduction  in  Dominion  imports  would clearly be  strongly opposed by the Dominions  concerned  and the difficulties in  this respect  would be increased enormously if the United Kingdom Government were  in advance to set a limit to the further reductions to be  imposed on foreign countries.   The  situation might, in fact, arise where the Government would  have to contemplate a greater cut on the  Dominions than they would be able, under  the proposal now  made to Argentina, to impose on the foreigner.     8.  Within the next few weeks, general trade discussions as to a revision of the New Zealand-Ottawa Agreement will be  taking  place  with Mr. Nash, the finance Minister of the New Zealand Government.  The future arrangements as regards New Zealand&apos;s mutton and lamb supplies will necessarily form  a major factor in these discussions, as mutton and lamb  exports  are one of the most important elements in New Zealand&apos;s economy.  It would be highly unfortunate if those discussions had to be opened by an announcement that foreign countries had been safeguarded in regard to a prospective cut in which New Zealand would be involved, and  it would affect the whole  course  of  the trade discussions,particularly, no doubt, as regards beef.     9.  A  forecast of the supply situation in the next  three years is given in the Appendix.   It is  there estimated that, if total supplies  are to be kept at  the level which has  maintained healthy conditions  in the market in  recent  years, and if the cut on foreign countries is to be limited to a further 10 per cent,  on  existing quantities,  the cuts which it will be necessary to impose on  Dominion imports in 1939 will be of the order of 8 per cent, to 11^ per cent, (on  the levels which theywill  have reached in 1936).   It should be remembered that such a percentage cutwould be four times as heavy in tonnage on the Dominions.     10.  Some expansion of demand may be looked for, but it would be unwise to leave ourselves insufficient  liberty of action if this did not take place to  thenecessary extent.
APPENDIX.                       MUTTON AND LAMB SUPPLIES.    THE following table shows  the total supplies of mutton and lamb in GreatBritain for each of the years 1933 to 1936 as compared with the Ottawa StandardYear:                                                               -                                 (&apos;000 cwt.)Country.

Present indications are that actual arrivals from Australia and New zealand in 1936 will be somewhat below the Dominion estimates.     Total supplies have been very steady during the last two or three years at a level about 3 to 4 per cent, less than in the Ottawa Year.  Comparing 1936 withthe Ottawa Year, home production and imports from New Zealand show little change, but imports  from Australia  show an increase of 260,000 cwt. or  18 percent., while imports  of foreign countries have been reduced by 665,000 cwt. or34 per cent.     The sheep population in Great Britain has varied since 1900 from an averageof about 27,250,000 in the three years 1908-10 to a minimum of about 20,000,000in the years 1920-22.  The figures for recent years are                               Million.

On  the basis of past cycles, an increase of from 800,000 to 1,000,000  cwt.    11.   The question for decision is whether the proposed guarantee should begiven to Argentina, in the knowledge     (i) that it will lead to serious opposition from the agricultural industry and          from the  Governments supporters in Parliament and  will gravely          embarrass us in  negotiations with Australia  and New Zealand on          future arrangements for regulating mutton and lamb supplies;    (ii)  that the supply situation in 1989 will probably be such that the Govern-          ment will be faced  with  the  alternatives  of imposing  a  cut on          Dominion imports which  might well be equal to or greater than the          additional cut now provided for on foreign imports, or of allowing a          supply and price situation to develop, for which the only other remedy          available  will be an  Exchequer  subsidy  to  United  Kingdom sheep          producers.    October 23, 1936.
or more might be expected in the home output of mutton and lamb in the next twoor three years.  Since, however, the new cycle is starting at a relatively high level,the possible  expansion might  be  placed within  more modest limits of  say500,000 cwt. to 700,000 cwt.    In  order to keep total supplies of mutton and lamb at about recent levels,therefore, it would be necessary to apply the full extra cut of 10 per cent,  onforeign countries and a cut on Dominion supplies in the third year (1939) of from per cent, to 11^ per cent, on the levels which they will have reached in 1936.    The position in 1939  would be as in the following table (the first column isbased on the lower and the second on the higher figures of home production andcuts on  the Dominions) :                                         &apos;000  cwt.          &apos;000 cwt.

Total sheepnumbers in Australia this year are not, it is true, very different from last year&apos;s figures, but it is well known that Australia has considerable potentialities for fatlamb production. In New Zealand, the provisional returns of sheep population for1936 show an increase of about 1,000,000 head  as compared with last year. More-over, the proportion of breeding ewes  to total  sheep is still increasing, which,barring unfavourable seasons, implies an increased capacity for rapid expansionof lamb production.Ministry of A griculture and Fisheries,         October 23, 1936.
