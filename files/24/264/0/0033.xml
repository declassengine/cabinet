PART  I                          CHAPTER  I                        INTRODUCTIONProcedure   1. At  the commencement  of our proceedings we issued throughthe  press a general  invitation  to all  persons  and  representative bodies, who might desire to appear before us, to furnish the secretary with a statement in writing of the evidence they proposed to submit.Having regard to the nature of the inquiry we considered it essentialto  insist upon  this  condition with  reference  to  the submissionbeforehand of evidence in writing.  It no doubt added to the timeoccupied by the inquiry, and imposed much labour and expenseupon those who gave evidence but we think that it added immenselyto the value of the inquiry and was justified in the result.  2. The statements which were furnished to us, together with theevidence given in support of them, appear  to  contain practically all  that  can be said  either against or  for the continuance  of theprivate  manufacture and trade in arms and  munitions  of war, andmust therefore be of value  to any one interested in the subject.  3. Both the statements  and the evidence have been publishedverbatim and  an index has been prepared for facility of reference.  4. The prosecution  of the inquiry was subject  to unavoidabledelays, due at  first to the necessity of allowing adequate time for thepreparation of their evidence to the societies identified with publicpropaganda against the private trade in arms, and later to the pre-occupation with more immediate tasks, in the altering conditions ofinternational affairs during the past year, of the officials, both of the armament  firms and the departments  concerned with  imperialdefence,  whose  evidence was essential to our  inquiry.   On one occasion we ourselves deliberately suspended public sittings for the hearing   of evidence,  because the moment  seemed to us  to  be inappropriate  to the discussion in public of the matters relating to imperial defence then engaging our attention.  5. Immediately on  the appointment  of  the Commission theNational Peace Council, one of the representative bodies which havebeen particularly associated  with the  public propaganda  on thesubject of our inquiry, asked to be allowed to give evidence beforeus :  we  acceded to this request and  at the same  time  extendedspecific invitations to submit evidence to two  other bodies that have
 been  actively associated with  the propaganda conducted  in  this country since the War, viz., the League of Nations Union, and the Union of  Democratic Control.   Subsequently we asked Mr. Lloyd George and Sir Eric Geddes to give us the benefit of their views. We also  extended a similar invitation to Mr. P.  J.  Noel Baker, whose work at Geneva in connection with the Permanent  Advisory Committee, the  Temporary Mixed Commission and also  with the Disarmament Conference rendered him eminently well qualified to express an authoritative opinion.   6.  A list of the witnesses who have appeared before us is given in Appendix II.  Some of them were requested to give evidence  and some  volunteered to do  so.  Appendix III contains the  names of persons and bodies who have submitted to us memoranda, etc., on which we  have not thought it  necessary to subject the authors to oral examination, either  because the subject matter of their com- munications was fully before us in the statements of other witnesses, or was not directly  connected  with our inquiry.   Some of these memoranda are reproduced in Appendix IV.  In addition, we have received a large number  of communications bearing only remotely, or not at  all, on our inquiry, which we do  not think  it  necessary to particularise.   7. It was evident at  the outset of the inquiry that,  in regard to many of the subjects that would arise in the course of it, it would be essential to have the fullest information and advice from  the government departments concerned.  As  it appeared  that  over a large part  of the field of inquiry several  departments would be involved at  the same time, we  consulted Sir Maurice Hankey,  the Secretary of the  Committee  of Imperial Defence, and the  official in  touch  with all  the  departments  concerned,  as to the most convenient means of obtaining and co-ordinating the official  evidence that would  be necessary.  We were  informed that Sir  Maurice Hankey, with the then Prime  Minister&apos;s approval, would himself be prepared to submit  to us  a  general statement, which he would prepare in collaboration with   the  three  defence  departments, dealing with the  questions raised  by  the first heading of the Commission^ terms  of reference.  This  obviously  suitable  and convenient procedure  was readily accepted by the Commission, and it  was arranged that any matters not dealt with in Sir  Maurice Hankey&apos;s statement should be the subject of specific inquiry which the  Commission  would  address  directly  to  the  departments concerned.  8. We desire to place  on record our appreciation of the assistance that witnesses, both  official and unofficial,  have freely  rendered to us.  We have  been  greatly impressed by the zeal and energy which  has  been devoted  to  the preparation  of the  evidence put before  us and we think it right to  commend the public spirit inwhich it was undertaken, both by those who support and those whooppose the continued private manufacture of and trade in  arms.
 The subject is one  on which opinion is sharply divided and views are  strongly  held.  There can be  no question that  the opinions expressed to us were  the subject  of deep  conviction on the part of the  witnesses, and were  pressed upon us from  a deep  sense  of public duty.   9. We  desire to place on record that  the firms engaged in the manufacture  of  armaments showed themselves  anxious  to  assist our inquiry in every way. Evidence   10. Owing to the necessity of allowing time for witnesses to prepare their evidence, we were unable to begin  our public sittings before May 1st,  1935.   We have held 22 public sittings for the hearing of evidence.   11. Evidence has also been taken  at  four  private  sittings.  At two of these evidence was given by Sir Eric Geddes (accompanied on the second day by Major R. H. Mayo), and a verbatim report was taken  which was afterwards published in full.*   At a third private sitting we  were furnished confidentially  by  Sir Maurice Hankey with a detailed account  of the  organisation  of munitions supply under the Committee of Imperial  Defence.   The remaining private sitting was devoted to the examination  of representatives of a  British  armament firm  in  regard to the activities  in a foreign country of  an employee of that firm which were  disclosed as the result of the examination of certain of the firm&apos;s records by two of our members.  We thought that this matter would be best explored in private discussion with the representatives of the firm.   12. Our only other proceedings not conducted in public,  apart from  necessary private discussions  among  ourselves,  were a  visit to Woolwich Arsenal  and a subsequent talk with the Director  of Ordnance Factories.   13. A questionnairef was addressed to the principal firms engaged in the private manufacture of arms  with  a view of ascertaining facts in relation to their trade and manufacture  which we considered material.   In every case very  full and complete replies were  made to the questions addressed to them.   In some instances  requests were made  that the replies, or part of them, should be treated  as confidential.  We considered  every  such application on its merits and only  complied with it when  we considered the application  tobe justified.!   Apart  from these  portions of  the firms&apos;  evidence, and certain official information relating to imperial defence whichit  was clearly necessary in the national interest  to  refrain from publishing,  all the relevant documentary  evidence submitted to ushas been made public.* Minutes of Evidence, Day 11a.t See Minutes of Evidence, Day 13, pages 345/6, and Day 15, pages 466/7.% See statement by the Chairman, Minutes of Evidence, Day 15, page 438.
   14. It has  indeed  been our  unanimous wish throughout the inquiry, not  only that. the  inquiry  should be  conducted  under conditions of the fullest possible publicity, but that witnesses shouldbe given the widest possible  latitude  in  presenting their case, andthat in particular no hindrance should be offered to the full expres-sion of their  views by witnesses presenting the case against the continuation of the private manufacture  of and trade in arms.  Itwas in pursuance of this view that we decided to hear all the evidencethat might be offered  against  the present system before consideringthe evidence in its support.   15. The  wide  latitude  thus  allowed to  witnesses  necessarilyentailed a good deal of repetition and overlapping of evidence.  it also led to the admission  of  statements  and opinions in regard to matters which, on a strict interpretation of our terms of reference,were  not  directly  germane to the inquiry and on which therefore we express no opinion  and  offer no recommendation.   16. At this point, in order to explain the course taken by theCommission, both with regard to the reception of evidence, and withregard to the framework of this report, we think it desirable to call attention to the terms of  reference.   The first  and third heads ofthe terms of reference  present no difficulties either of interpretationor of application.   The same cannot be said of the second.   It reads as follows :        &quot; To  consider and report whether  any steps can usefully be    taken to remove or minimize the kinds of  objections to which    private manufacture is stated in  Article 8  (5) of the Covenant    of the League of Nations  to be open.&quot;   If the above-named article  is referred  to it will be found  to beworded as follows        &quot; The Members of the League agree that  the manufacture by    private enterprise of munitions and implements of war is  open    to grave obj elections.  The  Council shall advise how the evil effects    attendant upon such manufacture can be prevented, due regard    being had to the necessities of those Members of the League    which are not able to manufacture  the munitions and imple-    ments of war necessary for their safety.&quot;   17. It will be noticed that neither the  terms of reference nor thearticle  referred  to  identify,  or attempt to  indicate, what  the&quot; objections &quot;  or the &quot; attendant evils &quot;  consist of ;  and it will befurther noticed  that the  Commission is  not  directed to ascertain what  the &quot; objections  &quot; and  &quot; evils &quot;  are, or to form any  opinon as to the weight which should be attached to them.   18. The fact remains that it would  have been impossible for theCommission  to consider remedies,  unless  and until it was informedwhat  the  &quot; objections &quot; and  &quot; attendant evils &quot;  consisted of, towhich  the remedies were to be applied.  The only course open tothe  Commission,  therefore,  appeared to be  to ascertain  what
 objections had already been formulated at Geneva, in consequence of Article 8 (5) of the Covenant, and to invite expressions of opinion as to the existence of &quot; objections &quot; and &quot; attendant evils,&quot; and to treat these as the objections  and attendant evils to which their minds should be directed without necessarily passing any judgment upon them.   19. In so far, however,  as opinions thus expressed would probably be relied on in support of the contention that the private manufacture and trade in arms should be suppressed, the Commission realised that they would have to take into consideration in dealing with head (1) of the  terms of reference -together with  all other material  con- siderations the weight that should be attached to such opinions.   20. Having regard to the terms of reference we have not ourselves undertaken a detailed investigation  into  the existence of alleged evils either in this country or abroad.  Opinions will differ as to the value and probable results of  such an investigation,  if made, and in the absence of it, varying opinions will be held on the question whether the  alleged evils  exist. We  are unable  to pronounce that they do not.   21. We gave  very  careful consideration to the question  of the extent to which we should allow evidence to be  given in regard to what, as the  result of long continued agitation in this country, and allegations and suggestions made  in the course of public inquiries elsewhere, have  come to be known as the scandals alleged to exist in connection with the private trade in arms.   We were anxious that the presentation of the case in support of the abolition of the private trade should not be hampered by any narrow ruling of ours as to the admissibility of evidence,  but  we were convinced that  no useful purpose would be served by the  admission of unsupported allegationswhich we had no  means of investigating.   Our decision on  thismatter was stated by  the Chairman at the first public sitting in thefollowing terms :       &quot; In some  of the statements of evidence which it is intended     to lay before the Commission it appears  that the witness pro-     poses to give the names of persons or companies as having been     guilty of conduct deserving of censure in connection with the     manufacture of and  trading in arms, without attempting to     give evidence in  support of the  allegation.   The Commission     intend to deal  with this question as follows, namely :  In the    case of firms and individuals resident and carrying on business    abroad, and  of transactions taking place wholly abroad, it is    clearly not practicable for the Commission  to carry  out any    satisfactory  investigation of allegations  that  may be made.    The Commission,  however, will not decline to allow witnesses    to cite, in support of an argument, cases in this category which   have been the subject of public allegation  or  report.  The   Commission  must, however, exercise their own judgment as to
     the importance to  be attached to such allegations.  In the case     of allegations against a firm or individual resident and carrying     on business in this country,  and where, therefore, the  Corn-     mission is in a position to inquire into the matter, and the firm     or individual  can  give  any explanation of the circumstances     which they desire to give, the Commission is prepared to receive     particulars  of  any  such allegations and will inquire into  them     if they consider them relevant to  their inquiry.   This ruling     does  not, of course, limit or affect the general inquiry which     the  Commission propose  to make into the  question of the     manufacture of and trade in arms.&quot;  22. We do  not  seek  to  decry or minimise the  importance to beattached to the opinion, which is widely held among thinking andresponsibly minded sections of the community, both in this countryand elsewhere, that the existence of a private trade in munitions ofwar must operate to the public disadvantage. The desire to abolish the private trade  is no doubt  in part an expression of  the general desire to abolish war. The causes of war are remote and  intractable,its implements near and tangible.  It is not surprising that many people should project their hatred of war on to the instruments ofwar in a belief that the control of one will lead to the  suppression of the other. But there is much more than this in the policy of thosewho oppose the private manufacture  of arms.  It is conceived asan essential part of a great and worthy purpose,  the end of whichis the construction of world peace.  It may be legitimate  to questionwhether  the  abolition  of  private manufacture  would  have any important effect in contributing to  the achievement of this purpose,but it would be  wrong to doubt the sincerity of belief of those whoadvocate this  policy, and impolitic, in a democratic community, to disregard the strength of their conviction, or to consider the policy they  advocate  as  unworthy  of attention  or  respect  because ithas  been  supported, by some  of its  adherents,  by irresponsiblepropaganda.
PART  II                         CHAPTER  II             OUTLINE  OF  EVIDENCE SUBMITTED   23. For a full summary of the cases presented to us against and infavour of the continuance of the private manufacture of and trade in arms we refer to  Appendix I where it  will be found set out.   It is sufficient here as  an introduction to what follows to set out in briefepitomized form  the  nature  of the two cases as presented to theCommission, and  the lines upon which the inquiry proceeded.   24. As against the  continuance  of  private manufacture,  muchreliance was placed upon the state of public opinion on the question as evidenced by the result of the Peace Ballot and as indicated in the speech of Lord Halifax in the House of Lords in which he said        &quot;.....this  is  one  of the  questions that arouse a very     sincere and very profound feeling ....  in the minds of our people     ....   Rightly or wrongly, .... the great majority of them     ....  conceive this  question of the private manufacture of and     trade in armaments  to be directly connected with the  great     issues of peace and war, on which they feel more deeply and     more vehemently than  upon  anything else ;  and,  therefore,     regarding war, as they do, as the greatest  evil  to which the     nation could  be  exposed,  and  regarding it indeed as  only     justifiable in  cases of ultimate and extreme  national necessity,     they  are  .... disposed  to  regard   the  preparation of the     implements of war as too high and  too grave a thing  to be     entrusted to any hands less responsible than those of the  State     itself, fearing any intrusion into so dangerous a field of any     interests less imperative than  those  of  national security and     national  necessity. &quot;*and  by the numerous resolutions and  communications of which a selection is contained in Appendix  IV.  Much  reliance was alsoplaced upon the objection that  as long as private manufacture was allowed to continue, so long would it be possible  to make profit outof war, with all the accompanying and undesirable consequences.  25. Much reliance was also not unnaturally placed upon the  list ofalleged evils attending the private manufacture and trade in arms and* Official Debates, 27th March, 1935.
 munitions of war which are set out in the Report of the Temporary Mixed  Commission to the  League of Nations  Assembly  of  1921, viz:       (i) that armament firms have been active in  fomenting war          scares and in persuading their  own  countries to adopt          warlike  policies and to increase  their armaments ;     (ii) that armament firms  have  attempted to bribe government          officials  both at home and abroad ;    (iii) that armament firms  have disseminated false reports con-          cerning  the military and naval programmes  of various          countries in order to stimulate armament expenditure ;    (iv) that armament firms have sought to influence public opinion          through the control of newspapers in their own and foreign          countries;    (v) that armament firms have organised international armament          rings through which the armament race has been  accentu-          ated by playing off one country against another ;    (vi) that armament firms have organised international arma-          ments trusts which have increased the  price of armaments          to governments.  26.  In addition to these alleged evils reliance was placed upon thefollowing objections :      (i) that under the system of private manufacture wars may be          prolonged by reason of the supply of arms to opposing          armies :  and that the system may result in the supply of          arms to a potential  enemy ;    (ii) that  the  existence  of a private  trade in  arms,   etc., is          calculated to disturb international  relations and  to have          a  deleterious effect on peace and disarmament efforts ;    (iii) that private trade in arms  necessarily involves solicitation          and touting for orders by armament manufacturers ;    (iv) that under the system of private manufacture, research and          development of designs and inventions are hampered ;    (v) that the system of private manufacture leads to  the dis-          closure of information of  a  national value which it is in          the national interest to retain ;  in fact that secrecy cannot          be maintained under private manufacture ;    (vi) that private manufacturers are  unable to  provide for  the          expansion necessitated by  war,  that the potential  ex-          expansion represented  by exports is of little value and that          nationalisation is ultimately inevitable.  27.  A separate branch of the case  of  the  opponents of private manufacture was based upon its alleged inefficiency and the lack of opportunity for fully  developed research.
   28. The case against private manufacture rested very largely on inferences which we were invited to draw from the nature of the trade.   29. We were also referred to the evidence given before the Special Committee   of  the   United   States  Senate   investigating   the munitions  industry.   30. Very few actual occurrences have been brought to our notice in support  of any of the above  contentions.   Three only have been mentioned,  viz.,  the Mulliner  case, the Japanese case, and  the Shearer  incident.   One additional  case  was discovered upon an examination of the files of the firm  concerned.  All these are dealt with at a later stage in this report.   31. On the other hand those who  support  the continuance of the private manufacture of and trade in  arms, while giving full credit to the  good faith of  those who entertain a contrary opinion, contend that the case as presented to the Commission is purely speculative in character and unsupported by evidence ;  that  it overrates  the importance  from the point of  view  of peace or war of the private manufacture of  and trade in arms ;  that  it fails to realise  that the  causes of war lie  far  deeper than the opponents  of private manufacture are prepared to realise, and that it is those causes which -create the demand for arms  ; that  the  supply of arms follows upon the demand and does  not create  it; and that the specific instances to which attention was called do not justify the conclusions sought to be drawn from them.   32. They further contend that the suggestion of inefficiency and want of research is not justified and that it is a mistake to assume that the  abolition  of private manufacture would take the  profit out of war;  but above all  they contend that the private manufacture of arms  is  an essential part of the  war potential  of  this country which, under existing conditions and the necessity of rapid expansion in time of sudden emergency, or  the  breaking  out of war, cannotsafely be dispensed with,  and further that permission  to export arms and munitions  of war  under  proper control is  essential if private  manufacturers  are  to  maintain  themselves in a state ofconstant  efficiency.
PART  III                        CHAPTER  III                LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS   33. In succeeding chapters we shall discuss the various questions referred to us in the order in which  they arise in our terms  of reference, and we shall indicate the  conclusions we  have reached and the recommendations we  have to make as the result of our consideration of those questions in the light of the evidence we have received.   34. It is impossible, however, to give any serious consideration to the problems committed to us  without realising how much less formidable those problems would be  if the international conditions of their solution were different.  Of the  possible changes in the international conditions, there is one,  viz., the limitation of arms by international agreement, which has recently been, and may again be, the subject of international negotiation.  Unhappily that negotiation has so far produced no tangible result and for the moment the project is submerged, but there can be  no doubt that the achievement of an international system of arms limitation would serve the common interest of the peoples of all nations, as it must command the common aspirations of the multitude of people in all countries who desire peace.  If this be so, we cannot believe that it is beyond the possibility of achievement,  or that it  is unprofitable to consider it in relation to our problem.  35. Apart from its immense importance as a means of securing a general  peace, the limitation of armaments by international agree- ment seems to us to provide by far the most important and potentially effective means of obviating the possibilities of abuse that are said to be inherent in the system of private manufacture of  and trading in arms.  We shall therefore submit some observations in regard to it, although its wider and more  essential  purposes in the domain ofinternational policy are outside the scope of our inquiry.  36. It is hardly open to question that if the total available demand for armaments  in every  country were in  fact restricted  both quantitatively  and  qualitatively  to   a known  maximum  under international supervision most,  if not all, of the objections to whichthe system of private trade has been stated to be open would beremoved,  and those not  removed would  be  greatly diminished.
For the potential evils to which it is liable depend ultimately  onthe  possibility of seeking private profit in an expansible market.If the  armament  strength  of  all countries were  definitely and effectively limited, the profit motive would be without the stimulusarising  from the possibility of  increasing sales, which might lead tothe fomenting of war scares and the encouragement  of governments to the adoption of warlike policies or to the increase of their armamentstrength by such means as  the dissemination of false reports, theimproper influencing of public  opinion or the bribery of government officials.  The creation  of a  &quot; fear  market &quot; would  be nugatory.Solicitation for orders would be restricted to the purpose, legitimatein a competitive world, of obtaining  the  share of the restrictedmarket to  which a firm&apos;s efficiency and economy in  productionentitled it.  Bribery,  if  resorted to under  such conditions, wouldbe  bribery of the kind  which it is asserted has to be  resorted toin  order  to  obtain  government orders in  certain countries andhowever  undesirable from the  standpoint of commercial moralitysuch bribery  might  be, its effect in relation  to issues  of peace and war would be remote and unimportant.  37. Furthermore,  effective  international  limitation  would  notonly go far to remove the potential evils of the system of private manufacture, but it would in  a large measure remove the problemitself.  It would not, in our belief, be thought to be a matter of any great importance, given limitation, whether the  arms of individual countries were supplied by private industry or by  a state, and indeed the considerations which have led those responsible  for the defenceof this country to advocate the continuance of the private industry would lose much of  their force and importance.  38. It is,  of  course, the case  that the abolition  of the private manufacture  of arms  is,  in the  minds of those who advocate  it, a means to  an end.  It is conceived of as a contribution to the creationof conditions  that will engender world peace, and it  is realised thatthe achievement of  this aim would be more effectively assisted by international  limitation of arms than  by any change in the system by which arms are supplied.  39. While we recognise  to   the full the  obstacles to  effectiveinternational limitation,  it is our strong conviction that apart fromthe  important  contribution   it  would obviously  make  to  theconstruction of  world peace,  it would  provide  the  most  effective means available of removing from the system of private manufacturethe potentialities to evil which occasion such grave  anxiety  in the minds of those who  advocate its suppression.   It would be effective for  this purpose in  all countries, and would therefore  go  further than anything this country, acting alone, can possibly do to ensurethat the system of private manufacture shall not be productive  ofabuses.
                       PART  iv the  PRACTICABILITY   AND  DESIRABILITY  OFTHE  ESTABLISHMENT  OF A STATE  MONOPOLY         OF  ARMAMENTS  MANUFACTURE                        CHAPTER IV    THE INTERNATIONAL  ASPECTS  OF THE  PROBLEM                   OF STATE MONOPOLY  40. Under  the  first  heading  of  our  terms of reference we arerequired to consider and report on the practicability and desirability(both from the national and international point of view) of theadoption of a state monopoly of the manufacture of  and tradein arms (a)  by the  United Kingdom  alone,  (b) by the  UnitedKingdom in  conjunction with  the other  countries of the world.It will be convenient to consider the latter question first.  41. As to  the practicability of establishing by international agreement a universal system of state monopoly of the manufactureof arms there is little that can usefully be said.   In a sense it would no doubt be  practicable if all  the states  of the world agreed toadopt it in principle and were willing and competent to  enforce it within their  own borders.   But protracted efforts at Geneva inthis  direction  have led to little practical result.   Between  1920and  1924 the Temporary Mixed Commission, which was set up bythe First Assembly  of the League of Nations  in 1920 to prepare proposals for  the reduction  of armaments,  as provided  for  by article 8 of the Covenant, sought means for securing by international agreement machinery for regulating the  manufacture of and tradein arms.  42. Throughout  that period  progress  was  blocked  because ofthe divergent views held as to whether private manufacture shouldbe abolished  or whether it should be  subjected to control.   In1924 the problems of manufacture and  trade were  separated,  andwhilst,  as  we shall  show in a later chapter of this report, some progress has  since  attended  efforts to  reach an agreement inregard to the international control  of the trade  in arms, no progress has been made in the direction of an international agreement to abolish the private manufacture of  arms.  43. Apart from  the question of practicability, however, we donot consider that a change to a system of universal state monopoly
 of the manufacture of arms  is desirable whilst the present inter- national situation obtains.  We do not think that the establishment of such  a system would  entirely remove  the objection  which is- entertained to making a profit out of the  trade.  It  is, we think, difficult to assume that producing governments would be prepared to supply arms to non-producing governments at cost price.  The profit under such a system might go to the tax-payer instead of to the individual, but the inducement would remain.  It is conceded that the non-producing countries are entitled  to a supply of arms and  munitions of  war for the perfectly  legitimate purposes of self- defence, the maintenance of order, and the fulfilment of international obligations,  and that if all sources of private supply are cut off, a non-producing country must either start its own manufactories or purchase from some producing country.   44. The  conclusion  at which we have arrived on this point is that in the present state of international affairs the setting up of a universal system of state monopoly is unlikely either to reduce the available supply of arms and  munitions  of  war,  or to increase the prospect of a general peace.   45. We are  accordingly unable to recommend that, while present conditions obtain,  the promotion of general state monopoly should be accepted as part of the international  policy of this country.   46. The conditions in which armaments are manufactured vary greatly in different countries.  In common with all other industries the manufacture of armaments is completely nationalised in Russia and it is so much under the control of the state in Germany  and Italy that, though an element of profit is permitted in these countries, it is  for  all other purposes treated as  a national industry.  The French Government now proposes to nationalise certain French armament firms and the Nye Committee has by a majority of one recommended  that the same  course should be followed by  the United States.  None of these examples seems to us  to  have  much value for  British industry but if an international conference decided that  uniformity in the  method  of manufacture would  facilitate either the reduction of armaments or the control of their export we should be in favour of Great Britain taking any necessary steps to co-operate with a view to securing the desired uniformity.  47.. We  do  not  rule out the  possibility  that under changed conditions of international relationship other considerations might predominate.   If limitation of  arms by international agreement is achieved the matter will no doubt have to be reconsidered.  If and when the nations of the world are ready and have sufficient mutual confidence to deal  radically with  questions of  war and peace, it might well be right that the United Kingdom should be prepared to co-operate in a  scheme of international state monopoly if that were  generally desired.  But when that time arrives the questionwhether arms should be produced by private or  public agency maybe found to have little importance.
                         CHAPTER V      THE  PROBLEM OF  STATE MONOPOLY IN  THE                      UNITED  KINGDOM  48. In the last chapter  we have given reasons for thinking thatthe adoption of a policy of state monopoly throughout  the  worldby  international  agreement is at present impracticable  and haveruled out the desirability  of this country adopting state  monopolyin conjunction  with the other countries of the. world, unless anduntil some international agreement has been arrived at.  49. We pass  to consider what, in the absence of international agreement, the  policy of this  country should be acting unilaterally.  50. The decision upon this proposal must be influenced by theviews taken -    (a) upon the moral and humanitarian considerations put forward         in support of a state monopoly ;    (6) upon the  weight to be attached to  the  suggestion that the         existence of a private trade  in arms  has a real influence         upon  issues of peace and war ;    (c) upon the relative  practical  advantages and disadvantages         inherent in a system of state monopoly of the manufacture         of and trade in arms ;    (d) upon the  importance  to be attached to the continuance of         the private industry from the point of view of imperial         defence ;and upon the relative importance  to be  attached to these  con-siderations.(a) Moral and humanitarian considerations  51. We have made some observations bearing on this aspect ofthe matter in the introductory chapter of this report, and a summaryof the  moral  and humanitarian considerations that have  been urged upon us in the course of the evidence is contained in Appendix I.  52. We believe  that  the moral objection advanced against theprivate  manufacture of arms is to some extent a projection of the moral objection that is felt towards war itself.  53. It is possible to share the idealistic aspirations of  those whoseek the eradication  of war as an instrument of  policy withoutimputing moral obliquity  to those  who prepare  for it in a  world in which war is only  too certainly a possible contingency.  indeed the moral considerations, whatever their  force, may be appliedequally  to the provision of arms by the state and to their provisionby private industry.
   54.  It  may  be  said  that  the present  system  is  essentially distinguishable  from  state  monopoly because  it  permits of the operation of the motive of private gain.  This is not, in our opinion, a necessary distinction on moral grounds.   55.  It is desirable to prevent the profit motive, in this as in other trades, from operating as  a stimulus to objectionable  courses of conduct.  It may be necessary, in this as in other  virtually  mono- polistic industries, to limit profit to what is considered to be adequate remuneration.   But the  mere  fact that  profit is earned does not make the private arms industry morally objectionable.   56.  Important as we feel the moral and humanitarian considerations that have been  advanced to be, they do not, in  our opinion,  afford sufficient ground for abolishing the private industry in this country, but we think it is  the duty of the government, on general grounds, to subject the industry to  such measures of public regulation  and control as would establish  clearly that its conduct is a  matter of government responsibility. (b) The influence of private industry upon peace and war   57. Even the most  convinced and enthusiastic advocates of the abolition  of the  private  industry refrain  from saying that its existence is in any real sense a primary cause of war  ; though the suggestion that  it is at least a contributory cause, if not  a  primary cause,  is implicit in much of the argument by which nationalisation is commonly supported.   58. A distinction must here  be  drawn between armaments  and national policies in regard to armaments  on the  one hand,  and the system by which they  are supplied, on the other.   59. There  is no  question  about the part  which armaments have played in the development of modern war.   They have not merely reflected, they have intensified  the fears, suspicions, and jealousies of nations, and enormously increased the scope and  destructiveness of  war.  Through  the  enlistment  of  the  highest scientific  and engineering  ability in  the  designing  and making  of  weapons of destruction, the whole nature of war has been changed.  Montesquieu said that kings should  so make war as to have done one another theleast possible damage  when peace was restored  ; modern  govern-ments seek to arm themselves with weapons which inflict the maximum of loss and suffering upon their opponents.  60.  The effect of the competition in armaments which precededthe Great War can be traced in the records which are now available.These show  the military staffs of all the principal powers  in a stateof increasing alarm lest they should either lose the lead which theysupposed themselves to have gained, if further time were permitted,
1  * The third volume of the Memoirs of Conrad von Hotzendorf (Chief of theAustrian General Staff) contains much material on  this subject, includingrecords of his conversations with General von Moltke, the Chief of the GermanGeneral Staff.  Both Austrian and German.official documents  bear witnessto the part played by fear of Russia, if she were given time to complete herpreparations.  f For the Russian estimates see Prof. Fay&apos;s Origins  of the  World  War,Vol. I, pp. 524-36, and the Livre Noir, pp. 365-72.or be surprised before their own preparations were complete, if warcame sooner than they expected.*  61. In both the European groups the military staffs were anxiouslydiscussing what would be the &quot; favourable moment &quot; for the conflictwhich they assumed to be  inevitable, and both fixed it at the point at which they assumed or hoped that they would be  at the height of their power as measured in armaments.  In the autumn of 1913and early months of 1914 no argument was more constantly repeatedby Austrian  statesmen  and soldiers in their endeavours to obtainthe consent of Germany to a policy which was likely to lead to a warwith  Russia than that the latter would be irresistible if, with hergreat resources and inexhaustible man-power, she were given thetime  to complete the armaments and build the strategic railwayswhich she  then had in preparation.  The German and Austrianmilitary chiefs  were agreed that the  nations of the Triple Alliancewere at the zenith of their armed power in the year 1914, and thatthey were likely to  decline relatively  to their opponents with every year  that  followed.  The  Russians  were  of opinion  that their&quot; favourable moment &quot; would not be  until some years  later, f  62. In proposing  the last great increase in German armaments in1913, the Chancellor, Herr von Bethmann Hollweg, told the Reichstagthat  Germany did not want war, but wanted to be sure if war cameshe would win.  To provide themselves with the margin of arma-ments which  would enable them to win a war, if war came, was bythis  time the object  of  all the governments, and the competition between them made it more and more difficult for any of them to besure  that  they could reach this point.   Power  was  always beingbalanced, unbalanced, and re-balanced at a higher level.  All sawin front of them a point at  which taxpayers would be exhausted andfeared that it would be reached sooner on their side than on that oftheir  opponents.  Many said that war would be  preferable to thecontinued strain of this armed peace.  63. In all  these respects the part  played by armaments in therecent history of war is  beyond dispute.  But a different question arises when it is asked whether their  manufacture by private firms,as distinguished from their manufacture by governments, aggravated,or in any large measure contributed to, these evils.   We  find itdifficult to believe that  the method of manufacture can have had any large influence  on the  result, so far at all events as  the leadingpowers were concerned.   The fears, suspicions, and jealousies which
led to the competition in armaments needed no artificial stimulus ;governments considered  themselves under an imperative duty notto fall behind in the race, and the question  for them was simplywhether they would produce  more speedily and efficiently by onemethod or by another.  It is undoubtedly a fact that armament firms and the numerous industries on  which they relied for theirmaterial profited by these activities, and that they were zealous insoliciting orders.  There is evidence that in some  countries theyoffered bribes to officials and even paid newspapers to suggest thattheir governments were  showing  less  energy  than  the national security required.  But it is not clear that the numerous interests which profit by expansion of armaments would have been less active in these respects if governments had had a monopoly of the produc-tion of arms in their final stage ; and the political and historic causes which were  leading governments to expand their armaments were,in any  case, so  compelling that  it is not possible to  assign  much importance to other causes.   Much evidence has been laid before usto suggest that manufacture by governments  is more efficient thanmanufacture by  private firms.  If that is true, there is no reason to suppose that fewer or less  destructive weapons would have been produced under  government  monopolies than  under  the  presentsystem.(c) and  (d). The  relative practical  advantages  and disadvantages     inherent in a system  of state monopoly of the manufacture of and     trade in arms, and the importance to be attached to the continuance     of the private industry from the point of view of imperial defence.  64. It is convenient to deal with these two heads together, and in doing so it is necessary to consider whether it is, or is not, desirable to abolish private manufacture of arms and to establish a state monopoly of such manufacture, and incidentally in this connection to deal with what, since the experience of the Great War, has become a questionof vital importance, namely, the possibilities  of rapid  expansion incase of great national emergency or the breaking out of war.  65. Having regard to  the position of things at the  moment itappears to us necessary to visualise the future on the hypothesis of      (a)  the existing conditions of emergency ;     (b)  a system of international disarmament;     (c)  a return to a condition of things which existed prior to  the         appointment of the  Commission, and  which for present         purposes we designate as normal.  66. What it is possible or desirable to do in the immediate futureduring the first  period has been  practically settled by the decisionof the Government as indicated in the Statement relating to Defence*t* Cmd. 5107.
of the 3rd March, 1936-namely, that during the period of rearmament -ment private manufacture of arms is not only to be continued, butit is to be encouraged and increased.  67. Should a system of international disarmament happily emergeas the result of present difficulties and recent  experiences, we havealready  pointed out  the  desirability  of  co-operation with other nations  in any attempt to secure the prevention of  war, though  itwould be foolish to attempt to prophesy what the proper course ofdealing  with the manufacture of  arms under the new conditions should be.  68. Assuming  then the existence of what for present purposes wecall a normal state of  things that is to say,  a state in which thiscountry is at  peace, but owing to international conditions is com-pelled to be in a state of constant preparedness for war we pass to consider the question of  a state monopoly as against a private trade in arms assuming this country is acting unilaterally.   Inci-dentally we would here call attention to the fact that it is not somuch to the private manufacture  as to the private trade in armsthat, objection is taken.  If private trade in the sense of the exportof arms was  forbidden probably little objection  would be taken tothe government making use  of private firms to supply nationalrequirements of arms and munitions of war.  69. The question which we are asked to consider includes both theprivate trade in arms and the private manufacture of arms.  70. Before entering into a discussion of this question it is material to realise  what  the position of the  private trade in arms  in thiscountry is, and  for this purpose it is necessary  to  know what its relation to the government is.  It is  true to say that  successive governments over a long period of years have  looked upon, andtreated, the private armament firms of  this country as an essential part of national  defence.  Successive governments have encouraged the establishment and the development of private armament firms,and  successive  governments  have, within limits,  ericouraged theexport of arms and munitions of war by private armament firms.  71. The extent of the reliance upon private armament firms hasbeen described to  us in the case of each of the defence services, asfollows :       The Navy. In  peace&apos; time  the Admiralty rely chiefly upon    private firms, not only  for shipbuilding, but equally for arma-    ments.   Apart from dockyard-built ships, only a few  special    requirements, such as torpedoes and cordite, are manufactured    to  any  extent in government  establishments.   To a lesser    degree transferable gun mountings, fuses  and certain shell and    ammunition components are obtained from the Royal Ordnance    Factories, but other naval requirements, such as non-transferable    gun mountings, hardened shell, armour, etc., are obtained from    private manufacturers.   Engines  and air vessel forgings for
     torpedoes are also obtained from the trade.   The filling of naval     mines, gun ammunition, depth charges, etc., is carried out by     the Royal  Ordnance Factories  in  addition  to filling for the     Army and Air Force.       This, however, does not  represent the sole contribution that     private industry makes to naval construction.  The  materials     of  which ships  built in the government dockyards are con-     structed consist of mamifactured or semi-manufactured articles.     The steel ribs, girders and plates, engines, boilers, armour, part     of  the armament, non-transferable  gun mountings,  quantities     of electrical and other auxiliary machinery, many of the instru-     ments used for navigation, range-finding, etc., are manufactured     by private firms.   Broadly speaking, the Royal dockyards put     in place the materials, all of which are supplied under contract     by outside firms.       The  Army. The War  Office rely  to  a lesser extent than the     Admiralty on private firms for their normal peace-time require-     ments.  Since the War and until recently, the Army has  been     living to a considerable,  extent on  war stocks and the orders     available for the trade have been relatively small.  The position     has, however, now been modified, and the time has passed when     the Army can continue to live on stocks remaining from the War.     Consequently the War Office are getting practically all their     tanks and the greater part of their shell from the trade.  Among     the classes of  article for which the Army places orders with the     trade, and which for the most part are not manufactured in any     of  the Royal Ordnance Factories,  are the following : Gun     forgings;  heavy  coast  defence  mountings;  heavy calibre     armour-piercing  projectiles;  predictors;  fire  control instru-     ments ; searchlights  ; sound locators ;  tank engines ;  bullet-     proof plate,   armour plate  and gun shields ;   armoured  car     chassis ; motor transport ;  machine guns and automatic guns ;     electric signalling lamps ;  and heliographs, and all signal and     wireless stores.  It will be seen, therefore, that  the dependence     of the Army on private manufacture in time of peace is very     considerable.      The Air Force. Apart from the Royal Aircraft Establishment     at Farnborough, which is devoted to experiment and research     only, the Air Ministry have no manufacturing resources whatever     and are entirely dependent  on the various private firms in this     country, except for such armament as is manufactured for them     by the Royal Ordnance Factories or the Naval Torpedo Factory.  72. The very existence  of a private trade in arms in this countryis  thus  the result  of  a deliberate policy directed by succeedinggovernments towards the keeping alive of an effective private industryto meet the country&apos;s needs in peace time and provide a reserve of manufacturing capacity to&apos; which the government can turn in theevent of war.
   73.  Responsibility for the maintenance of a private trade in arms thus rests with the government and not with the private firms, and inasmuch as the existing licensing system places in the government&apos;s hands entire control of the export of arms&apos; and munitions of war and no export can take  place except by government permission,  it is unfair to place the  responsibility for a policy  of  permitting  the private trade in arms upon other than the right shoulders, which in this case are the governments shoulders and not those of the private traders.   74.  Responsibility for the existence and maintenance of the trade has been and is the  responsibility of the government for  the time being.  Responsibility for the conduct of their business, of course, lies with the firms themselves.   75.  We now proceed to consider  the question of this  country, acting unilaterally,  establishing a  state monopoly of the  manu- facture of arms,  assuming the existence of what we have called a normal state of  things,  and in this connection, incidentally,  the question of  the importance of the private manufacture and trade in arms  and munitions of  war from  the point  of view of imperial defence.   For some  of the witnesses who  gave evidence  before us the policy of general nationalisation of industry, though not specifically advocated, was, in effect, the economic and political background of their  advocacy of a  state monopoly of arms manufacture.  Others thought  that the  difficulty  arising  in connection  with   ancillary industries need not  be  faced, their   view  being  that the further removed a  particular industry  is from  the actual manufacture of lethal products, and the greater the outlet available to its  products for non-lethal uses, the less  likely  are  those engaged in  it to be interested in &quot; developing &quot; the &quot; lethal &quot; market.  76. It is,  however, a logical necessity of any wholly satisfactory scheme, the purpose of which is to obviate evils by transferring the manufacture of arms from private to public agency, that it should cover the whole field of industrial activity in which the motive of private profit can  be stimulated in  relation  to  arms production. This field is clearly not confined to the manufacture of arms them- selves ; it extends through the industries  producing components and essential materials to a wide ramification of trades which  areliable in greater or less degree, but in all cases  to some  extent, to be stimulated by the prospect of private gain from the similar practicesalleged as a reason for nationalising  the arms industry itself.  Thisliability indeed is not confined to the industries directly concernedwith the materials and processes of arms manufacture ; it extend to  the  producers of  many of  the  essential  requisites of  peace,e.g., coal, fuel oil and civil aircraft.  77.  We are not  convinced that the nationalisation of even those industries more closely and directly associated with the provision ofwarlike needs could be satisfactorily  achieved except  as part of ageneral scheme of nationalisation of industry as a whole.
  78. It is no doubt the dilemma created by the realisation of this position that has led  to the proposal that state monopoly shouldbe confined to that stage of industrial production at which a productis first converted into  a product capable  of use for lethal purposes.A great deal of care has been given by Colonel Carnegie and othermembers of the League of Nations Union to the formulation of a detailed scheme under which the  monopoly of  manufacture at thelethal stage would be exercised  by a national armaments boardon which would also be conferred  powers  in relation to the orderingand  supply of lethal products,  which it is thought would enable itto exercise an effective control  over subsidiary industries.  79. A similar proposal involving the setting up in peace-time of apublic department endowed with  the monopoly of manufacture of specified products, and charged with the whole organisation of thesupply  of  munitions to the defence  departments,  was  submittedto us by Dr. Addison.  80. There can be little question that these are possible schemes,and  that many of the objects which they are  designed to secureare in themselves  desirable.  Opinions will differ in regard to theadministrative   details of schemes  of   this  character.  But  theprovisions  of these schemes  which give  to the state an exclusiveright to manufacture  certain articles are separate proposals, andwe  think that the proposal  to establish a state monopoly of themanufacture of particular products or products at a particular stage in their production presents so  many practical difficulties and islikely to lead to such serious delays that even if some measure ofnational control of the armaments industry was  called for, thisparticular proposal could not be recommended.  81. The experience of the Great  War shows that state organisationand co-ordination of production is  essential for the rapid mobilisation of manufacturing  capacity and the  maintenance of  supplies on anadequate scale.  The  state  is better able  than private industryto command control over supplies of material  and labour and toensure their proper distribution.   It is by means of the possessionof government factories, in which practical knowledge and experience is gained,  that the state  is able to  exercise its function in thesematters.  The  government factories  are,  moreover, invaluable andin fact essential, as a means of checking the operations of private industry both as regards costs and methods of production.  Govern-ment factories  again are valuable for undertaking repair work whichbecomes particularly costly if sublet into private hands.  82.  State enterprise, however,  has its  limitations.   There are obvious and admitted objections  to the entry of the state  into theproduction of  commercial products  of a non-armament type andalso  to its entry into export trade.  Private armament manu-facturers are able, by utilising their plant and employees on alterna-tive work when government orders are not available, to maintain a reserve of equipment and labour  which is invaluable to the country
on an outbreak of war.  The maintenance by the state  of factorieson a scale sufficient to meet fluctuations in the demands of the services which occur even in peace time would be wasteful and  costly even after  making allowance  for whatever  saving  in  cost might  bepossible by reason of the elimination of the profit element from stateproduction.   Reserve plant  maintained by the  state  would  needconstant renewal if it were  not to become obsolete ; it would  be useless without trained labour kept available to utilise  it, and thevalue of reserve labour maintained in idleness or semi-idleness isnot to be compared with labour employed on analagous work  onwhich  experience  and  knowledge is being  constantly acquired.Experience  shows that inventiveness and ingenuity  are  by  nomeans lacking in government service, but conditions of employmentin private industry and the  wider  sphere of activity available are such that  the state  must  inevitably benefit from research andinvention resulting from the utilisation of private industry.  83.  In conditions of modern warfare the  need of  the  country  onan outbreak of war is for a system which ensures the most rapid and effective  mobilisation of the whole of the industrial resources of thecountry.   Neither  state enterprise  nor private industry can alonesecure this.   It can only be  secured by the utilisation of both andto this end we would urge that there should be the greatest measureof collaboration  between  the state and private  industry in peacetime.   In the late war the output of the state and of private industry were both vitally necessary.  It is true that absence of preparationon the part of private industry led to shortage of supplies for theArmy in  the early  stages of the War, but it is only fair  to point tothe  cause of  this shortage.   It was not due to the  existence of asystem under which reliance was  placed on private industry theNavy relied then and relies to-day to an even greater extent than theArmy on private industry ; the Navy experienced no serious shortageof supplies in the late war, because the Navy had placed  orders withthe  private firms  regularly  in  peace time. The  shortage  in thecase of the Army was not due to the need for a larger state manu-facturing organisation :  it was attributable to the failure of everyoneto foresee the expansion that  ultimately  occurred  in  the  armed forces maintained in the field and to the increased rate of consumptionof supplies by those forces as compared with the rate of consumptionanticipated.   The  difficulties of the  private firms  were increased as a result  of indiscriminate recruiting of skilled  labour  for theKitchener Army.  84.  There is one consideration,  however, which seems to  us  tobe crucial in this matter.  It is the consideration that if the utilisation-tion of private industry for the manufacture of arms in peace-time were discontinued, and the whole of the government&apos;s  peace-time requirements were to  be manufactured in government establish-ments, the amount of plant and equipment available for the expan-sion of production in the eventuality of war, and the force of personnel of all kinds experienced in the use of that plant  and equipment,
 &quot;would be very materially diminished.  It is said by those who take the contrary view that this is not the case ;  that a given amount of peace-time manufacture  will provide the  same available margin for expansion  of production whether it is  owned and  operated by private industry or by the government.  This statement we believe to be fallacious, for if the given quantity of peace-time manufacture is  spread over a number of industrial units normally  employed on commercial production  instead of being confined to  government units continuously employed on arms production, there will obviously be in existence at any time a larger force both of plant and personnel available for  ready  application to the production of arms in an emergency.   It is true that  this applies  with greater force  in the case of some  products than it does  in the case of others,  and it applies with minimum force in the case of certain types of munitions for the production of which  very  expensive and highly specialised plant, not capable of commercial use, is required ;  but even in the case of munitions of this character,  which  are not produced  con- tinuously or in great  quantity, there is advantage in a system under which part of the peace-time requirements are produced  by personnel which can be employed on commercial work involving similar pro- cesses in the intervening periods.   85. It has been  urged upon us as an argument in support  of the policy of nationalisation that inasmuch  as  by common consent it will be necessary  to  nationalise the whole field of arms production in  the eventuality of war, it  would be well to nationalise the arms industry  in peace-time.   We are unable  to accept this argument. What is to be anticipated in the event of a  major war is the conscrip- tion to the  governments needs of ail the industrial capacity  of the country.  The whole of the engineering industry, for instance, will, it is contemplated, have to be at the orders of  the government, and it is beyond question that the proper utilisation in  war-time  of the resources  of the country&apos;s  private industry will not  be achieved unless it  is fully and efficiently planned and organised in advance in peace-time.  There is all the difference in  the world between this preparation  for  war emergency  during  peace,  followed  by  the general conscription  of  industry when the  crisis  arrives,  and  a policy of  nationalisation  in anticipation of the crisis.   Indeed the situation  requires, in our opinion, as a  specific condition  of the successful employment in emergency  of  the general  industry of the country, that  the plant  and personnel of  that  industry should be  required to co-operate in  large measure  in the supply of  arma- ments during peace.  86. We thus reach  the conclusion that, when judged by reference to  the four criteria which we regard as  relevant,  the  proposal to prohibit the private manufacture of and trade in arms in this country, and to substitute  for it  a  state  monopoly is unacceptable.   We have indicated our definite conclusion that  no sufficient case  canbe  made out for this proposal,  provided  that  the industry can be
strictly supervised, and that the balance of advantage lies in a systemof collaboration  between  private industry  and  the government,a system which, in the language of one of the witnesses, is likely toproduce better results by encouraging two sources of ingenuity andinventiveness than by relying upon either alone.  In a later chapterwe shall state  our views as to what the nature  of that collaborationshould be.  87. In the end the question to which our inquiry leads is that ofproviding an organisation in time of peace which is (1) efficient and economical and (2)  lends itself to rapid mobilisation and expansionon the outbreak  of war.   In regard to economy and efficiency wehesitate to say that a state monopoly would be either less efficientor more  expensive  than private manufacture.   In regard  to cost,much would depend on the compensation paid to  the shareholdersof armaments  companies and on  the  amount  of new plant whichwould be necessary for purely military purposes, if the plant whichis now devoted partly to military and partly to  commercial purposeswere  no  longer available.  Very difficult questions would arise ifthe policy of nationalisation were applied to the shipbuilding yardsin private  hands which  are now available  for  naval  construction.No precise estimates on those subjects are possible, but the policyof nationalisation would undoubtedly require a large initial outlayon a business which, according to ordinary commercial standards, isjudged highly  speculative, and whether in  the long run it would prove  remunerative to  the state  would depend on a great manyfactors of management and policy,  some of them raising political considerations, which it is impossible to forecast.  88. No scheme of nationalisation could be recommended withouta full inquiry into the cost question, a question upon which opinionsdiffer, and which presents many difficulties in arriving at any reliableestimate.  As  we are not recommending nationalisation we  havenot considered it necessary to embark upon this inquiry.  89. But whatever view is taken on these matters, it can scarcelybe doubted  that for the  state alone to keep the war  potential upto the point at which it is now kept by the co-operation of the stateand private enterprise a much larger quantity of labour would haveto be permanently  allotted to the arms industry than is necessary under a system which provides alternative employment for workersnot immediately needed for the production of arms.  Experience inall countries suggests that the resistance to the reduction of expendi-ture on armaments increases in proportion as a government increasesits direct employment of labour in the manufacture of arms.  Theextent to which governments are using the manufacture of arms asa means  of  employing labour or curing unemployment, and  theirfear of the consequences if they demobilise this labour, is, we believe,a new and very  serious  obstacle to the reduction of armaments,and it seems to us  an advantage that this  country should not bemore deeply committed than is necessary in this respect.(C 227S6)C
                         PART  VTHE EVILS AND OBJECTIONS TO WHICH PRIVATE.    MANUFACTURE  IS  ALLEGED  TO  BE OPEN                        CHAPTER  VI                  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS  90. The second branch of our inquiry relates to the existence ofalleged evils.  We are asked to consider  and report whether thereare any steps  which can usefully be taken to remove or minimise the kinds of objections  to which private manufacture is stated inArticle 8 (5) of the Covenant of the League of Nations to be open.  91. We have already indicated in an  earlier part  of this reportthe attitude which we felt  compelled to  adopt in reference to  this branch of our  inquiry.  92. Although  not charged  or  required to  inquire  into  theexistence  of the alleged objections it is,  we think, desirable in thegeneral interest that we should point out what the state of facts  is in reference to the list  of  objections which  appears in the Report ofthe First  Sub-Committee of the Temporary Mixed Commission tothe League of Nations of September, 1921.  It has apparently been generally assumed that this list may be accepted as an authoritativefinding after full investigation  and  inquiry.   That this is a  mis-conception of the real  position is best  indicated by quoting the language of the Sub-Committee, which is as follows :        &quot; The Covenant recognises that the manufacture  by private     enterprise of munitions and implements of war is open to grave-     objections.  What are these objections ?  They are not defined     by the Covenant ;  they cannot be extracted from the delibera-     tions of the committee which  drafted the  Covenant.  It is,     however,  common knowledge that the public mind is strongly     prejudiced  against the uncontrolled private manufacture of     munitions and implements of war,  and that it is  a common     belief that wars are promoted by the  competitive zeal of private     armament firms, and would be rendered less frequent were the     profit-making impulse  brought  under control  or  eliminated
     altogether.   In general,  the objections that  are  raised  to     untrammelled private manufacture may be grouped under the     following headings :        (1) That armament firms have been active in fomenting war-            scares and in persuading their own countries to  adopt            warlike policies and to increase their armaments.       (2) That armament firms have attempted  to bribe Govern-            ment officials, both at home and abroad ;       (3) That armament  firms  have  disseminated  false reports            concerning  the military  and  naval programmes  of            various  countries, in order  to stimulate armament            expenditure.       (4) That armament  firms  have sought to influence public            opinion through the control of newspapers in their own            and foreign countries.       (5) That armament firms have organised international  arma-            ment rings through which  the armament race has been            accentuated by playing off one country against another.       (6) That  armament  firms  have  organised  international            armament trusts which  have  increased  the  price  of            armaments sold to Governments.&quot;  93. It  is clear from this quotation that the Committee did notinvestigate the question of the  existence of these evils.  They placedon record in their report, which we are informed  was unanimouslyaccepted, what they described as being the objections that were raised  at the time to untrammelled private manufacture.  In so  far  as these objections  may have been founded on theconduct of foreign firms, we have no means of forming an opinion asto whether they were justified or not ;  and we do  not attempt  todo so.  All that it is relevant for us to say is that  if such objectionsare well founded in the case of foreign firms the only possible remedy,in the  absence of  international agreement,  is for the government within  whose jurisdiction the offences are committed to deal withthem.  94. We think it proper, however, to make some comment on theevidence  that has been submitted to us in regard to the evils that are alleged to  exist,  so far as United  Kingdom  manufacturers areconcerned,  and the deductions to be  drawn from that  evidence,before passing on to a consideration of the steps that can be taken  toremove or minimise the possibility of such evils.  95. The alleged evils are recited in Appendix I and the supportingevidence  is there summarised.  So far as United Kingdom firms areconcerned the charges are few and the evidence scanty.  The case hasnot been  based in the main on specific charges.  There are, however,general allegations as to the operation of ordinary business methods and the effect of ordinary business considerations  in a trade which
profits from international tension, and it is thought that these musttend towards the promotion of warlike policies and be inimical to peace.  96. The belief on which these allegations rest has been encouraged by  the actions  of the firms  themselves,  and we think that the responsible heads of firms and directors of public companies need tobe reminded of the essential difference between the trade in arma-ments and ordinary commercial business.  The frivolous and cynicallanguage which some of them have used in their speeches at share-holders&apos; meetings and  which  has also  been  disclosed  in the correspondence examined by the American Committee has  givengreat and legitimate offence to immense numbers of persons, and is largely responsible for the importance given to the scandals side ofthe question in the public mind.  We believe that importance to be greatly exaggerated, but in so far as it is  supposed that armament firms are unaware of or blind to the special dangers and liabilities of the trade they are pursuing, they themselves are largely responsible&apos;efor it.  97. It is  always necessary to  bear  in mind that  competition between armament  firms   differs  from  all  ordinary  commercialcompetition in that the success of one firm does not mean the failureof another, but rather increases  its chances of doing business.  Forexample,  a British firm  may  supply  submarines to  a foreign government and a foreign  firm  may supply destroyers to a neigh-bouring government on the ground that they are needed to counter the submarines supplied by the British firm.  Taking the list of the alleged  evils in their order :  98.  We are not persuaded  on the evidence given before us thatBritish armament firms are guilty of having been active in fomentingwar scares or of persuading this country to adopt  warlike policies and to increase its armaments.  99.  We do not believe the armament  firms attempt the bribery ofgovernment officials in this country.  As to bribery abroad we havenot  sought, nor in fact were we in a position to seek, evidence as tothe extent to which it is resorted to.  The one incident that has beencited to us in evidence as illustrating that armament firms indulge inbribery to secure orders abroad is that of the Japanese Naval Scandalof 1914 of which particulars are given in Appendix V. To this itis necessary to add, as further evidence of bribery abroad, the case to which a reference was made in Chapter I of this report,  which came  to light  as the result  of an examination of  certain of  the records of a British armament firm by two of our number.   100. This case has some unpleasant features attached to it, among others that of  a bribe  of   50,000 ostensibly for a high  militaryofficial in a foreign country.  This bribe was offered by a subordinateofficial without authority and was not actually paid ;  but there is no
doubt in the minds of the members of the Commission that both the firm concerned and the firm representing its interests in the foreign country connived at a bribe being offered by their joint agent, until such time as doubts arose as to the ultimate destination of  the bribe.We consider the action of both firms in this matter is deserving of censure.  101. The  employment  of agents  abroad  paid by  commissionappears to be  the accepted practice of  certain armament firms inthis country.   In  a  foreign country where  the giving of bribes orthe sharing of commission is necessary in order to secure  a govern-ment contract it is obvious that the agent, if he is to do business in face of  competition, must  be  active in soliciting  orders,  and must give bribes.  It is idle for the firm employing agents under  the aboveconditions to attempt to disclaim all responsibility for so  objection-able a practice by pointing out that the  commission they pay theiragent is his to do what he likes with and that they give him noorders  and leave  him to dispose of it  as  he pleases, or that thecommission is small.  The commission they pay the agent may be small, but if the order is large, as in this class of business it frequentlyis, there is  ample provision for a substantial  amount of bribery.A system which enables bribery to be cloaked under commissions  andleaves the principals free to profess ignorance of it seems to us to beopen to grave objection.  102. The Mulliner incident is the only evidence that has been put before us to substantiate the charge that armament firms disseminatefalse reports  concerning  the  military  and naval programmes ofother countries. Particulars of this incident and our view of it willbe found in Appendix V to this report.  103. No evidence has been  laid before us  which we  regard assupporting the charges  that armament firms  in this country have sought to influence public opinion through the  control of the press.  104. So far as the charges of nefarious and underground activitieson the part of manufacturers in the United Kingdom, in connectionwith price raising and other rings, are concerned we do not considerthat such charges have been established upon the evidence  before us.  105. It is true that in the case of some, though not all,  armamentsupplies, competition in  the ordinary sense does not exist betweenmanufacturers  in the United Kingdom.   This  is due, in part, to thefact that certain types of heavy armaments and chemical productscan only be produced by plant of a highly specialised nature and byspecially trained  labour, and  that such  plant or labour  may onlybe at the disposal  of a particular firm.  It is also due in part to theconclusion of price maintenance  agreements  intended to  eliminatereckless  competition, or to the amalgamation, in the interests of rationalisation, of rival firms.  The existence of such price main-tenance  agreements is sometimes disguised by a form of collusivetendering.

The  employment  of agents  abroad  paid by  commissionappears to be the accepted practice of certain armament firms inthis country.  In a foreign country where  the giving  of  bribes orthe sharing of commission is necessary in order to secure a govern-ment contract it is obvious that the agent, if he is to do business in face of  competition,  must  be  active in soliciting  orders, and must give bribes.

So far as the charges of nefarious and underground activitieson the part of manufacturers in the United Kingdom, in connectionwith price raising and other rings, are concerned we do  not considerthat such charges have been established upon the evidence before us.  105.  It  is true that in the case of some, though not all, armamentsupplies, competition in  the ordinary sense does not exist betweenmanufacturers in the  United Kingdom.   This  is due, in part, to thefact that certain types of heavy armaments and chemical productscan only be produced by plant of a highly specialised nature and byspecially trained  labour, and  that  such plant or labour may onlybe at the disposal of a particular firm.  It is also due in part to theconclusion of price maintenance agreements  intended  to  eliminatereckless competition,  or to the amalgamation, in the interests of rationalisation, of rival firms.  The existence of such price main-tenance agreements is sometimes disguised by a form  of collusivetendering.(C 2278(3)C3
   106. It is undeniable that  this state of affairs might  put the armament makers in  a position to dictate  prices to governments,although there is no evidence that they have endeavoured to do so.But we consider that  price control by the government is essential.In certain instances this control could be exercised by comparing theprices charged with the cost of producing similar articles in govern-ment dockyards or arsenals, in others by putting out the supply tocompetitive tender and in  others  by comparing the price charged to the government for  an  article, with the price charged  by thesame firm for the same article to a purchaser other than the govern-ment.  But  these methods  of control  are  not  always applicable.Indeed in the case of mass produced articles competitive tenderappears as  one of the witnesses  said to be an &quot; anachronism.&quot;It may, in such event, actually increase the price to be paid by thegovernment because a low price is  only possible in mass productionwhere the whole or a very substantial portion of orders is given toa single firm.   107. We think that a rigorous system of price control for armamentsupplies is necessary from the  nature of the case.   108. The allegation  of the existence of international price-raisingrings is a matter which we could not investigate and we do not makeany finding on this question.  Some British firms are members ofcombines  or cartels which  include foreign manufacturers,  but theobject of  these combines is  to avoid competition  or the corneringof nickel  and other raw materials. In the case  of the agreementbetween the Electric  Boat  Co. and Vickers Ltd., the objects inview were to enable Vickers Ltd. to make  use  of certain patentsbelonging to the Electric Boat Co. which are indispensable to theconstruction of submarines of the type manufactured by Vickers Ltd.,and to avoid price-cutting by dividing the sales territories betweenthe two firms.   109. There is one other matter,  which has been raised before us by several witnesses,  that can conveniently be  dealt  with  at thisstage. It has been alleged that the practice under which government servants are taken into the employment  of armament firms, orgiven directorships, during their  service or at  or after retirementfrom the public service, is objectionable.  One witness characterisedthis practice as &quot; a subtle  form of bribery,&quot; and the  allegation isthat  it creates a relationship  between firms and officials of thedepartments in which the complete independence of the latter inregard to  the  placing of contracts is  likely to be endangered orprejudiced.  The suggestion is obvious and there is no  need toelaborate it.  Witnesses have  been at  pains to assert  that it  is no more than  the suggestion of a possibility and that they make no specific charge. It has not been alleged by anyone that any publicservant has at any time allowed his independence to be in any wayimpaired.  We have no reason to believe, and do  not  believe,  that
the practice in question has been or is likely to be the occasion ofany weakening of departmental independence ;  it  is  a practice which  has  obvious  advantages in  a system under which thegovernment collaborates with private industry,  and  we  do not propose that it should be discontinued.   So far as concerns theproper conduct of civil servants and government officials generally,the matter is not  confined to the particular case of employment byarmament firms, and in general we are satisfied that the question ofthe conduct of public officials in regard to such matters may safely be left to  the discretion of the  service itself, in confident relianceupon the meticulous  sense of public duty by which the service as awhole is inspired.  110. We cannot, however, regard as satisfactory the position underwhich armament  firms are free to  recruit ex-officials and ex-officersof the Army, Navy and Air Force at their own discretion,  and wecannot ignore the suspicions which arise from the practice, howeverill-founded they may be.   We therefore recommend that officers,whether serving or retired, should not enter the service of armament firms in any capacity without the  specific approval of the minister in charge  of their department.   We make this  recommendationnot because we think the practice is objectionable or is likely to beabused ;  but in order that any public anxiety with regard to its continuance may  as  far as  possible be allayed.   We believe  thatthere is in fact very little  possibility  of abuse arising  from this practice under  existing conditions, and there will be even less if our recommendations regarding  the control of private manufacture and the limitation of profits  are adopted.  111.  For the removal of the objections to which the private tradeis  open we  are  satisfied that  no specific remedies, directed to particular  evils, will  avail.   The means to their prevention are tobe  found,  in our opinion,  in  the limitation  of armaments by international agreement,  and in.measures  recommended else wherein this report for the control by government of manufacture and export,  the establishment  of international arrangements for thecontrol  by  all countries  of both  manufacture   and trade, theimprovement of the  licensing system, the limitation of  profits inpeace-time, and the conscription of industry in time of war.
                        CHAPTER VII    INTERNATIONAL CONTROL OF THE TRADE IN ARMS  112. The problem of regulating and controlling the trade in armshas engaged the attention of succeeding committees and commissionsat Geneva, with varying success, over a period of more than 15 years.  113. Following the  decision reached in  1924 to separate theconsideration of this question  from  that of manufacture, an initialsuccess attended the efforts to  reach agreement on the international regulation of the trade in arms when  the Arms Traffic convention was concluded in 1925, to which some 38 states subscribed either by signature at the time or by subsequent accession.  But subsequentevents have shown that this success was destined to prove of little value.  114. Twelve states have ratified the Convention and three  othersnotified their  accession to it  but the Convention is,  and  seemsdestined to remain, a dead letter in consequence of the  failure orunwillingness  of certain  principal   arms-producing countries toparticipate in its provisions.  We are informed that the convention is disliked by certain  of the larger producing states and that  it is open to the objection that its provisions with regard  to licensing and  publicity place non-producing states  at  a  disadvantage ascompared  with  producing states.   As  to  this latter  contention,however, it is only fair to add, as has been pointed out to  us bywitnesses,  that the objection is not one that has been formally putforward by the non-producing  states themselves.  115. Throughout the years  1926 to 1929,  private manufacturewas the subject of study by a Special Commission appointed by theCouncil  of the  League.   In  the years subsequent  to  1929, themanufacture of and trade in arms has remained a subject of study and report, but  since the meeting of the Disarmament conference it has become submerged  in the consideration of the larger subjectof disarmament.  116. For a more detailed account of these discussions and of thereports which have emanated from the committees and commissionswhich have been studying  the  problem at  Geneva,  reference  isinvited to the memorandum which was placed before us on  behalfof the Foreign Office  which has been  reproduced as Appendix IIIto the Minutes of Evidence heard on the 19th Day.  117. In  May,  1934,  the  United  States  Delegation to  theDisarmament  Conference took  the  initiative in making  it animmediate objective of the Conference to secure an  agreement onthe subject of the manufacture of and trade in arms.   To this end
 they submitted  to  the Bureau  of  the Conference  in  November, 1934,  a set  of  Draft Articles for regulating and  controlling  the manufacture of  and trade in arms  which subsequent  discussions showed to command a considerable measure of support.   118.  Shortly the  object of the Draft Articles is to provide for national control  over the manufacture of and trade in arms under international supervision, including inspection on the spot ;  there would,  under the proposals,  be  full  publicity of all manufacture, publicity of orders,  strict licensing of all exports and imports and licensing of manufacture.   119.  We are informed that the Committee of the Disarmament Conference  which studied  these articles  reached the  unanimous conclusion that control on national lines of arms manufacture and trade by means  of  a system of licences was essential ;  that  the principle  of  equal  treatment  of producing and  non-producing countries and of state and private manufacture should be accepted, as also  should the principle of publicity for all production, export and import  of  arms ;  that the establishment  of  a  Permanent Disarmament Commission  as an international supervisory body is desirable  and that the principle  of responsibility of  states to that body for  the accuracy of returns of arms manufacture and trade should be accepted.   120.  It is in regard to the methods to be adopted for giving effect to certain of  these conclusions that difficulties have, in fact, arisen.   121. So far as this country is concerned we are informed that  the difficulties of substance which  stand in the way  of  a general acceptance of the United States  Draft  Articles are two in number. In the first place, the Draft Articles provide for the communication to the Permanent Disarmament  Commission of  all orders for war material received by state and private factories, of returns giving particulars of the quantities of weapons ordered and of copies of all export and import permits issued.   These  proposals were, at the instance of the French  Delegation,  subsequently widened, during the course of the discussion  of the Draft Articles, into a system whereby the whole process of arms manufacture and supply would be controlled from the time an order  for war material was contem-plated until  the  weapons concerned were  actually delivered tothe forces.  122. We are informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government regardboth  the original United States proposals  and the  subsequentamendments  introduced  as  involving  a   degree  of   publicityinappropriate to a convention which does not provide for limitationof armaments and that they have accordingly proposed an alternativesystem of publicity which provides for (1) advance annual returns of expenditure under the headings of the various categories of warmaterial ; (2) quarterly  returns under the headings of the various categories of the  materials produced ;  (3) quarterly returns under
the headings  of the various categories of imports and exports ofwar material, showing countries of origin and destination.   123. The second difficulty of substance which  we are informedstands in the way of the acceptance  of the United States DraftArticles  by this  country relates to the machinery of supervisionproposed.  The United States proposals provide for the setting upof regional committees by the Permanent Disarmament commission at Geneva, which would be responsible for carrying out the super-vision, including local inspection.   For this  purpose it is proposedthat the committees should have power to visit and investigate the storage and shipping departments of factories and  the war materialcontained therein and to examine officials and others on oath.   124. We understand that whilst recognising the  necessity for and being willing to submit to a system of international supervision and inspection as part of a convention for the limitation of armaments,His Majesty&apos;s Government do not  regard the machinery of super-vision which  is proposed in the United States Draft Articles assuitable  or  acceptable as part of a convention dealing only withthe manufacture of and trade in  arms.  They have accordingly suggested  an  alternative method of  documentary  supervision.Under the United Kingdom proposals the Permanent disarmament commission  would  examine  information  communicated to  it ;they  would  have the  right  to call  for  further  particulars andexplanations and would be required to report  the results of their&quot;inquiries to the Council of the League of Nations.   125. In his closing speech to the Arms Committee of the Conferencein April, 1935,  the  British Delegate  expressed, on behalf of  theUnited Kingdom Government, entire sympathy with the principlesthat lie behind the United States proposals.   He laid stress on thefact that, in submitting their alternative propositions, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had two aims in view to make the proposed conventionappropriate to its purpose and to render it  generally acceptable and he  urged acceptance of  the  more limited United Kingdomproposals on the ground that they were appropriate to their purpose and calculated  to be more generally  acceptable  than the  widerproposals contained in the United States Draft Articles.   126. We believe that the principles that  lie behind  the UnitedStates Draft Articles command a wide measure of support abroad,and that the Draft Articles afford a basis on  which an agreement for the  international regulation and control of the  trade in armsmight be reached. We recognise that the realisation of these proposals would be  of  less value than  an international agreement for thelimitation of  arms, and  that they involve restrictions that may be unwelcome or may  be thought to  be excessive for the limitedpurposes in view.  But we nevertheless think  that  the possibility should not be missed  of securing international agreement in thedomain  of arms control even on a limited scale.
158                        CHAPTER  VIII       GOVERNMENT  REGULATION AND CONTROL OF                     PRIVATE INDUSTRY   127.  In Chapter V we reached the conclusion that no sufficient case can be made out for the prohibition of the manufacture of arms in this country by private industry, and that the balance of advantage lies in a system of collaboration between private industry and the government.  We now turn to  the question of the nature of that collaboration.   128. The question of the organisation  of the private industry of the country for national defence has  necessarily presented itself at all stages  of our inquiry,  and its consideration has led us to the conclusion that nothing less is required than control by the govern- ment in peace-time of all arms manufacture and arms manufacturing capacity in the country.  Such control by the government is required in our opinion for the following purposes :      (1) To ensure rapidity of expansion in emergency periods ;     (2) To check prices and establish a planning system,in peace-time          conditions ;     (3) To prevent the  possibility of  profiteering in time of war or          national emergency, and thereby to eliminate the incentive          to those grave objections to which the system of private          manufacture is open.   129. Many interesting and constructive proposals in regard to the machinery of this control have been made to us by  witnesses of expert knowledge and wide experience among them Colonel Carnegie (Day 1, pages 22-6), Dr. Addison (Days 4 and 6, pages 81-2), Admiral Bacon (Day 11, page 313), Sir Eric Geddes (Day 11a, pages 7-9 and 11), and Sir Harry McGowan (Day 15,  pages 442 and 446).  It is not within the scope  of our inquiry to consider and report upon the relative merits of the administrative  and organisational details  of these  different proposals, and we refrain from commenting on them from that point of view.  130. In principle, however, we think there should be established by the government a body for the purpose of controlling supply and deciding questions  of priority, such a body should have  executive and not merely advisory powers over  supply, manufacture, costing and the authorisation of orders from abroad.  It should be presided over by a minister responsible to Parliament.  Its main duties would be the consideration and the decision of all questions of supply and manufacture in peace-time, the  preparation in full detail of theregulations and plans for  emergency expansion by  co-operation
between the  government establishments  and private industry,  the encouragement and development of scientific research, costing andthe control of prices and the inspection and the authorisation of allorders received from abroad by armament firms.  We recommendfurther that  the  governments own  manufacturing establishmentsshould be fully equipped for  the production in  some measure ofnaval, military and air armaments, that they should specialise inscientific research, that they should be responsible for the training of technical experts, take  the initiative  in  the production of designsand  improvement of machine  tools  and the formulation of massproduction methods not only for their own manufacturing require-ments, but for the use and instruction of the private industry of thecountry  in time  of  emergency.  By this means  the  government establishments would  in cases  of emergency be ready with  thespecifications, gauges, and particulars of machine tools necessary forrapid expansion by private firms. They would provide standardsby which costs could be checked.  They  would develop instruction in mass  production methods and would  have a trained personnelavailable for service as instructors in times  of emergency.   Theywould no longer have to rely entirely, as they do at present, uponprivate armament firms for any types of weapons, and would be fully  equipped for such production.   They would therefore  take amore important place than  they now occupy in the national systemof defence, and would be in a better position to serve the nation intime of emergency, when private industry is placed under a strain of expansion not yet within its powers to fulfil, or when some inter-national limitation of arms may induce private industry to restrictor even abandon its present range of manufacture.                        CHAPTER IX            TAKING THE  PROFIT OUT OF WAR  131.  In a general sense there is unquestionably something revoltingto the conscience of all ordinary men and women in the thought thatkilling, and the supply of killing power, is profitable to  particular groups of people, and the conception that war and  preparation forwar ought not to be  the occasion of private gain is,  we believe, thefundamental conception  from which the moral  objection to  theprivate industry springs.   To this conception is added the fear andanxiety that arise from the recognition of the possibility, undoubtedlyinherent in the system of private industry in the supply of arms, thatthose engaged in it  may be stimulated by the profit motive topractices in the conduct of the industry and trade which are sociallyundesirable in themselves, and, in the case of the arms industry, arefraught with danger  to the peace of the world.  Direct methods to
prevent the specific abuses which are feared are found to be eitherdifficult to devise or likely to prove ineffective for their purpose.  132. The  fact that under  the  existing  economic  system largenumbers of people, of all classes of the community,  by reason oftheir  employment, their  business interests or  by the holding of shares, may have  a financial interest in war or the preparation forwar, is  thought to create an unconscious  tendency in the public mind  towards warlike policies and a disinclination towards policiesmaking for peace. That the same people are for  the most  partsubject to much stronger influences, even in regard to their financial interests, tending  in  the  opposite direction, is forgotten,  or  it isthought  that  these  other  influences are more remote or  lessdependable.  133. The  consideration in  detail of the  situation  thus envisagedleads  constantly and  inevitably back to the initial conception that war and preparation for war ought not to be the occasion of privategain, and the removal of the profit motive itself is felt to be the oneradical and effective method by which it is possible to prevent abusesand to cure the moral malaise which is believed to be at once theircause  and consequence.  134. We are confident  that the public  feeling on this  matter,which we believe to be widespread, intense and  genuine, ought notto be  disregarded.  135. The complete removal of the profit motive  from private industry, which alone would satisfy the more ardent of those whofeel moral objection  to its continuance is, in our opinion, neithernecessary nor desirable, and  it is far from our  purpose to proposethat profits should be so restricted as to  discourage  private firmsfrom  undertaking  the supply of arms.  But it is our opinion that measures ought to be taken to restrict the profits of armament firms in peace-time to a  scale of reasonable remuneration.   Such a course is, in  our view, justified on its merits, having regard to the fact thatthe private  industry is in effect engaged in a public service and is virtually of a monopolistic character.  We believe that the profits of armament firms can be so limited without impairing the eff ective-ness of the industry or imperilling the country&apos;s war potential,  andwe  believe that if the  firms&apos; profits were so limited little would remain of the objection to the continuance of the private industry that is felt by a large section of the public.  136. We do  not propose to undertake  the task  of formulatingspecific  methods for  the  restriction of profits in peace-time.   Nodoubt it is one fraught with technical difficulty.   We have taken no evidence that would afford us a basis for  the consideration of theproblems involved, and we are not a suitable body to  advise on these problems.  137. We think,  however, that this is a subject  which  requiresfurther consideration and attention by the government.  We do not
 think that it will be sufficient for the purposes we have indicated to ensure that  the defence departments are themselves satisfied that the  profits  allowed  to  private manufacturers  under  particular contracts are fair and reasonable.  Nor do we believe that a measure of taxation, such as the excess profits duty which was enforced during and after the last war, will prove satisfactory to meet the  essential obj ect in view.   Under the scheme we have indicated in Chapter VIII, control of prices would fall within the purview of the body we have suggested.  It should,, in our opinion, be an essential characteristic of whatever system of control  be  adopted; but, while providing reasonable remuneration on  a scale  sufficient to  ensure  the co-operation of private industry in the service of imperial defence, it shall be such as  shall prevent excessive profit and at the same time satisfy the public that it does so.   138. But the control of profits in peace-time is not enough.   We believe that much of the objection that is felt to the  continuance of the private manufacture of arms is due to the dissatisfaction of public opinion in contemplating the profits of manufacturers in the event of a major war.   139. We believe that if it were known that in  the event of this- country being involved in a major war industry generally would be conscripted, and that everyone in the country would be required at once to put himself at the service of the state, a considerable part of the objection to the private manufacture of arms would disappear.. If the  state could choose the staff they wished to  keep in  industry and those they required to join the forces, and if, in addition, everyone from the  head of a business down were given similar positions and pay, according to the work they were doing, to those serving in the forces, it would  make  it still more unlikely  for those engaged in supplying the requirements of the  state in peace-time  to agitate for war.   140. We recognise that great difficulties are likely to be met in any attempt to formulate plans for the conscription of industry in time of war, but we are impelled to the belief that these difficulties will have to be faced,  and we recommend  that they should be faced at the earliest possible moment, so that there may be no misunderstandingas to the governments policy towards industry in the event of war,which should be that no one should be allowed to make a profit outof war, and that a war in which this  country is involved calls for anall-round sacrifice and not for an opportunity for profit making.
PART  VI                         CHAPTER  X                      EXPORT  CONTROL   141. The third branch of our inquiry relates to the arrangements in force in the United Kingdom relative to the control of the export trade in arms and munitions of war.   142. A history of  the origin  and  development  of  the export licensing system at present in force in this country, together with the texts of the enactments giving legislative authority  to the system, and of the orders and licences issued thereunder, is  contained in a memorandum prepared by the Board of Trade in collaboration with the Foreign Office, Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, and Board of Customs and Excise, which was reproduced as an appendix to the printed Minutes of Evidence given before the Commission on the 12th Day. A brief summary  of the information contained in this memorandum will also be found in Appendix I to this report.   143. In the minds of most critics of  the system of private manu- facture of arms the scope  for abuses lies preponderantly in the field of international trade.  Some of  us would like  to  see  the foreign arms trade of this country discontinued not only because we believe that many evils  are inherent  in  the present system, but also  to remove the anxiety with regard to it that undoubtedly exists in the minds  of many  thoughtful people, who, we believe,  might  be reconciled to the continued collaboration of private industry with the government under a system of profit control, in the supply of the governments needs.   A majority of us believe,  however, that the abolition of the private export trade in  arms, unless it were adopted by all producing countries, would, in its total result, be ineffective to remove the abuses that are alleged to exist, and are satisfied that one of the consequences of abolition, under present conditions, would be to create possibilities of international complication and undesirable reaction between governments which  would constitute a greater danger to peace than any of the  consequences likely to flow from the continuance of an export trade in arms by private firms  144.  It  has been strongly urged upon us,  however, on the one side, that  the responsibility for the foreign trade in arms conducted by  firms in this  country, and therefore for the consequences  ofthat trade, whatever they may  be,  rests not  upon the privatemanufacturers who engage in it, but upon the government, without
whose licence no consignment of arms can be exported.  On theother side it has been said that the potentialities of abuse mightbe largely removed by a tightening-up of the licensing system.   145. The  governments  ultimate responsibility  for  whateverconsequences may result from the export of arms abroad is incon-testable.  The Board of Trade is clothed by  statutory  authority,with  complete power to prohibit  any and every  exportation ofarms, and in practice no arms are  allowed to be exported unless their exportation is licensed by the Board of Trade, either specificallyor as  being in a category the export  of which is permitted under an open general licence.   146. It has been made abundantly clear to us, however, that thepolicy by which the responsible departments are guided in their administration of the licensing system is largely negative, in  thatit  does  not seek actively to  discourage  the export  trade  andcontemplates that a licence will be granted in every case in whichapplication is made, unless the defence  departments or the ForeignOffice have some specific and compelling reason,  connected withthe defence of the country or with  the  international situation ofthe moment, for withholding it.  The accepted policy is to interfereas little as possible with the normal activities and channels of trade ;while, in the submission  of the official witnesses and the representa-tives  of  the defence  departments  who  appeared before us,  theforeign  trade in  arms provides an  important and  necessary  partof the nucleus for the expansion of production in the eventualityof war,  and its encouragement is therefore essential in the interestof imperial defence.   147. It has  not been suggested  that the  licensing  system  inforce in this country is evaded, but as it is at present administered,it  is not looked upon as a sufficient safeguard by those who think the foreign  trade in  arms open to  grave abuses.  Nor  is it anysatisfaction  to them  to  be  told  that the existence of the systemrelieves the  private industry of responsibility for any  abuses whichmay exist,  and  transfers that  responsibility  to  the  government.From the point of view of those who seek the prevention  of abuses,the licensing system might well not exist, since under it the industryknows that it is to all intents and purposes free, within wide limits,to solicit and fulfil  foreign orders,  and  within those limits  is as likely as it would be, in the absence of a licensing system, to practiceobjectionable methods to increase its business.   148. We are not satisfied, on the evidence that has been submittedto us,  that  the nucleus for the  expansion of  productive capacitythat is provided by the export trade is, in fact, sufficiently great tojustify a policy  of  active encouragement  of the trade by  thegovernment.   In  the  case of  some categories of arms it may be so,though it has not been demonstrated to us that it is so. In the caseof those  categories of arms which constitute the bulk of the export
trade,  we  doubt  whether  the  country &apos;s capacity for expansionwould be diminished in a material degree if the export trade were reduced or  discontinued.  149.  While,  therefore,  we  do  not  recommend,  under existing international conditions, that the foreign  trade in arms should be definitely abolished  by this country acting alone, we are  of  theopinion that the administration of the licensing system should be governed by  an  outlook  different  from and  more  positive in character than  that which now  prevails.   To place  the onus ofjustifying the  grant of a licence upon the applicant, instead of leaving  the government departments with the onus of justifying a refusal would  no doubt be impracticable.  What we suggest is theabandonment of the existing policy under which licences are granted in the absence of a specific and compelling reason for refusing themand the substitution of a policy under which it is made a part ofthe duty of the official authorised to grant licences,  acting upongrounds specifically authorised by the controlling body recommended in Chapter VIII, to satisfy himself in each case that there is need for granting a  licence taking all considerations into account.  150.  Apart from this general recommendation as to the standpointfrom which the licensing  system  should be administered, we desireto urge  that licences should be granted only to such manufacturers and dealers in  arms and munitions of war as have been previouslyspecifically authorised to accept orders for export by the controllingbody recommended in Chapter VIII, that they should be grantedonly against specific orders  by  importing  governments, and  noexport  licence should be  granted  except  against a specific  importlicence issued by the government  of the importing country, whichshould  state that the consignment is not  for re-export. As  a partof these recommendations we desire to urge also the abandonment of the present practice under which certain categories of prohibitedexports  are licensed for export to certain destinations under open general  licences.  In making  this latter recommendation we have in mind particularly the position in regard to the export of aircraft.Aircraft, assembled or dismantled, and aircraft engines are, by virtueof an open general licence  issued by the Board of Trade  on  the1st June, 1931, permitted to  be  exported without specific licence.The export of armament  and military equipment for aircraft, it istrue, can be effected only under  specific  licence, but  such controas is exercised over the export of aircraft apart from their armament and military equipment is effected, so we are informed, by reason-ofa liason which  exists  between the Air Ministry and  the aircraftmanufacturing firms.  151.  It has been repeatedly urged before us, and we feel that thereis much force in the argument, that the convertibility of  civil aircraft to military purposes and the increasing uses to which civil aircraft,particularly of the heavier type, can be put for military purposesmakes it imperative that a more rigid form of control should be
exercised over all exports of aircraft.   We urge therefore that noexports  of aircraft  should  be  permitted except  against  specificexport licences granted only after individual consideration in eachinstance.   152. Recent events suggest that there is a possibility that aircraftmay be equipped and despatched  from the United Kingdom  for service in  foreign countries.  We understand the accepted opinionfto be that aircraft  do not come within the terms of the ForeignEnlistment Act,  1870,  but the danger to world peace involved insuch activities is manifest.  We think that it is desirable that  thegovernment should  consider whether the  provisions of the  Actshould not be extended so as to cover aircraft and to make it an offence to  equip, arm, despatch or man aeroplanes or airships in orfrom the United  Kingdom with the intent or reasonable  belief thatthey will be used in  connection with hostilities in which a friendlynation is engaged.   If  the offence is committed by a corporation the officers in control of its business should be deemed to be guilty of such  offence  unless  they can  establish  that  it was committedwithout their  knowledge or consent.  A presumption of this natureis already to be found in the Treaties of Washington Act,  1922.
PART  VII                         CHAPTER XI                       MISCELLANEOUS   153. There  remain two matters, which do  not arise  directly under our terms of reference but have been prominently raised in the course of the evidence, in regard to which  we think it desirable to make some comment.                 The Disposal of Surplus Arms   154. It appears that although the policy of the government has changed in this matter from time to time during the last 10 years, it has for several  years now  been the practice to permit of the disposal,  through recognised  contractors and dealers  and under certain safeguards, of arms and munitions of war which are surplus to the needs of the service departments.   To this end a contract was concluded in 1930 between the War Office and Messrs. B.S.A. Guns,  Ltd. (who in their turn appointed the Soley Armament Co. to act as their representatives in the matter)  whereby the  War Office assigned to the B.S.A. Co. sole rights of purchase and resale (subject  to  safeguards)  of surplus  Lewis guns  and 1914  pattern rifles, whilst the Company, in addition to making payments for the guns and rifles, undertook to maintain certain rifle plant.  Contracts were also concluded  in 1931 with the Soley Armament Co. under which  rights were  assigned to that  Company in  connection with the purchase and resale of surplus Hotchkiss guns and steel helmets.  155. The policy under which these contracts  were  concluded is defended primarily on the ground that it is in the  interests of the taxpayer that a market should be found for stores that are surplus to the needs of  the  services;  the trade  does not, it  is  claimed, increase the workbs supply of arms.  156. With these  arguments we are not impressed. The trade in surplus or second-hand arms is in our view one to be  condemned. In the light of figures that have been furnished to us as to the sales effected under the contracts to which we have referred,  we feel that no financial benefit of any importance can be claimed to have resulted from the policy.  A trade in surplus or second-hand arms appears to us  to  lack any of the merits that are claimed in favour of  thecontinuance of private manufacture.  It does not add to the country&apos;swar potential either  by increasing its manufacturing resources orby adding to its reserve of skilled labour ;  it  adds nothing to  the
 country&apos;s  ability to  improve  on the  types and designs of its armaments.  Its effect in fact is calculated to hamper rather than foster the armaments industry, on the efficiency of which we are told the country is so fundamentally dependent.   157.  We accordingly desire to record our  condemnation of the policy under which this trade  is allowed to continue.   We were informed  by the representatives of the War  Office who  appeared before us, that the contracts to which we have referred were due to expire this year.  We venture to express the hope not only that they will not be renewed but also that no other similar contracts will be concluded in their place. The Bearing of the  Findings of the McKinnon Wood Committee                  on  the Commissions Inquiry   158.  A  number of  witnesses  who  have appeared  before us as advocates  of  the nationalisation of armament  production  have quoted from the findings of the Committee which was  appointed in June, 1918, under the chairmanship of the Rt. Hon. T. McKinnon Wood to  inquire into the control, administration and organisation of the Royal Ordnance Factory at Woolwich, and have claimed that that Committee&apos;s findings indicated that they favoured nationalisation of armament production.   159. We think it right, therefore, that we should  indicate our views in regard to this submission.   160. This Committee issued three reports, and in its final report, issued in  1919,* certain recommendations  were made in  favour of the reorganisation of the administration of the Arsenal with a view to ensuring that it might  continue to function satisfactorily as a centre of  production for munitions  of war.   The findings of  this Committee in favour  of the continuance of the Royal Arsenal as a manufacturing unit have been cited not only as supporting the view that the functions of the private firms could be effectively performed by the State Arsenals, but also as indicating that by recommending the continuance of  the  Arsenal notwithstanding  the alternative sources of  production  available the Committee took the  view that the alternative sources should be closed.   We have examined the reports of the McKinnon Wood Committee and such records as are available of the Committee&apos;s deliberations and we think it right to record that we can find no foundation for  the suggestion that  this Committee intended their  report to be interpreted in this sense, nor in  fact would it  have been their  duty  to  submit  any  suchrecommendation having regard to their terms of reference.  161. We may add that our opinion in this matter is  confirmedas a result  of the examination  of a witness who  was actually  amember of the McKinnon Wood Committee  and subscribed  to itsreport.* Cmd. 229.
PART  VIII                       CHAPTER  XII  SUMMARY  OF  CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  1. The most effective available means of removing or minimisingthe objections to the private manufacture of and trade in arms wouldhe the limitation of arms by international agreement.  [Chapter III.]  2. The establishment of a universal system of state  monopoly ofthe manufacture of arms is likely to be impracticable and in presentconditions the promotion of general state monopoly should not be apart of the policy of this country.  [Chapter IV.]  3. The abolition  of the private industry in the  United  Kingdomand the substitution for it  of a system of state monopoly may be practicable ;  but it is undesirable.   No sufficient case has in ouropinion been made out for taking so drastic a step.   We believe thatthe reasons for maintaining the private industry outweigh those forits abolition.   We  are  of opinion that the  necessities of imperialdefence cannot be effectively met, in existing conditions, except bythe maintenance in peace-time of a system of collaboration betweenthe Government and the private industry of the country in the supplyof arms and munitions.   [Chapter V.]  4.  We recommend that public officials (whether serving or retired)should not accept appointments with armament firms except withthe approval of the minister in charge of the department  in whichthey are serving or have served.  [Chapter VI.]   5.  We are of opinion that this country should continue to promote and  encourage the adoption of  measures  for  the  international regulation and control of the manufacture  of and trade in  arms.We believe that the proposals to this end recently submitted to theLeague of Nations by the Government of the United States afford abasis on which agreement might be reached.   [Chapter VII.]   6.  We recommend that the Government should assume completeresponsibility  for the arms industry in  the United Kingdom andshould  organise and regulate the  necessary collaboration betweenthe  government  and  private  industry;  that  this  responsibility should be exercised through a controlling body, presided over by a minister  responsible to  Parliament, having  executive powers  inpeace-time and in war-time, over all matters relating  to the supply and manufacture of arms and munitions, costing and the authorisation of orders from abroad.   We further recommend that the Governments own manufacturingestablishments should be fully equipped for  the production in some measure  of  naval,  military, and  air  armaments   of  all  types. [Chapter VIII.]
   7. We recommend that measures be taken to restrict the profits of armament firms in peace-time to a reasonable scale of remuneration, designed not only  to  prevent excessive profits,  but to satisfy the public that they do so.   [Chapter  IX.]   8. We are of opinion that  the problems involved  in formulating plans for the conscription of industry in war-time will have to be faced, and should be faced without delay.   [Chapter IX.]   9. We are of opinion that the administration of  the system of licensing exports of arms should be governed by  an outlook different from and more positive  in character than that which now prevails ; that licences should be granted only to such firms as shall have been specifically authorised to accept orders for export by the controlling body already recommended ;  that the grant  of licences should be restricted to orders by foreign governments,  supported by import licences  issued by  those governments which  shall  state that  the goods will not  be re-exported.   We recommend that the practice of  issuing  open general licences for the export of certain classes of arms, etc., be  discontinued ;  that specific licences be required in all  cases ; and in particular that a rigid control be exercised  over  all  exports  of aircraft,  whether classified as military or civil.   [Chapter X.]   10. We recommend  the complete cessation  of the private export trade in  surplus and second-hand arms  and  munitions  of  war. [Chapter XI.]   We desire to express our  appreciation of  very great assistance which we have received  from our Secretary, Mr. Twentyman, and our Assistant Secretary, Mr.  Haigh, and their  staff throughout  our inquiries and in the preparation of this report.

                             APPENDIX I                SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE SUBMITTED  The evidence submitted to us may conveniently be summarised under thefollowing headings :     1.  Public opinion;    2.  The alleged evils of and objections to the system of private manufacture;    3.  The arguments that have been advanced in favour of retaining private         manufacture ;    4.  The arguments  for and against  the abandonment of private  manu-         facture by this country acting unilaterally ; and    5.  The evidence that has been tendered bearing on the export control         system in force in this country.                            1. Public Opinion  A principal  ground on which witnesses have based their contention that private manufacture should  be abolished is that  the  result of  the &quot; PeaceBallot &quot; is evidence of a public  demand for prohibition ;  it is  contended that the fact that more than 90 per cent,  of those who voted in the Ballotdeclared themselves in favour of abolition is  evidence  of  a general  desire for the nationalisation of the industry of such weight that it cannot be ignored.The speech by Lord Halifax in the House of Lords on the 27th March, 1935,in which the following passage occurs, has been cited as indicating an accurateexpression of public opinion in the matter :       &quot;... this is one of  the  questions  that arouse  a very sincere  and    very profound feeling ... in the minds of our people. . . .   Rightly or    wrongly, . .  . the great majority of them .  . .  conceive this question    of the private manufacture of and trade  in  armaments to be directly    connected with the great issues  of peace and war, on which they feel more    deeply and  more vehemently than upon anything else; and, therefore,    regarding war, as they do, as the greatest evil to which  the  nation could    be exposed, and regarding it indeed as only justifiable in cases of ultimate    and  extreme national necessity,  they  are . .  . disposed to regard the    preparation of the implements of war as too high and too grave a thing    to be entrusted to any  hands  less responsible than those  of the State    itself, fearing any intrusion into so dangerous a field  of any interests    less imperative than those of national security and national necessity.&quot;  That there  is  widespread support of  these views is  evidenced by the numerous resolutions and communications (of which a selection is reproduced in Appendix IV) that have been submitted to us by responsible bodies in thiscountry.  On the  other hand those  who support the continuance of private  manu-iacture assert     that a reliable opinion upon an extremely difficult and highly contentious       subject can only be  formed  by  those who have had an  opportunity       of studying the question in all its bearings ;    that the general public  cannot possibly have had that opportunity ;    that while the general feeling against the private manufacture of and trade       in arms is a very natural one, no great weight should be  attached by       the  Commission  to what must necessarily be an uninformed public       opinion.
Stimulationof demandbypropagandaanddissemina-tion of falsereports.        2. The Alleged Evils of and Objections to Private Manufacture   Those who advocate nationalisation allege not only that there is evidenceof a public demand for the prohibition of private manufacture but that thereare specific  objections to the continuance of the system, and they base their case in the  main on the alleged evils  attending the private  manufacture ofarms which are set out in the report  of the Temporary Mixed Commissionto the League of Nations Assembly of 1921.*   They are -     (i) that armament firms have been active  in fomenting war scares and          in persuading their own countries to adopt warlike policies and to          increase their armaments ;     (ii) that armament firms  have attempted to bribe government officials          both at home and abroad ;    (iii) that armament firms have disseminated false reports concerning the          military and naval  programmes  of various countries in order to          stimulate armament expenditure ;     (iv) that armament firms have sought to influence public opinion through          the control of newspapers in their own and foreign  countries ;     (v) that armament firms  have organised international armament rings          through which the armament race has  been accentuated by playing          off one country against another ;    (vi) that armament firms have organised international  armaments trusts          which have increased the price of  armaments to governments ;  In addition it  is contended    (vii) that it is wrong that a  financial interest  should  exist  which is          dependent on war and preparations for war ;   (viii) that under the system of private manufacture wars  may be prolonged          by reason of the supply of arms to opposing armies ; and that the          system may result in the supply of arms to a potential enemy ;    (ix) that the existence of a private  trade in arms, is calculated to disturb          international relations and to have a deleterious  effect  on peace          and disarmament efforts-;     (x) that private  trade in arms  necessarily involves solicitation  and          touting for orders by armament manufacturers ;    (xi) that under the system of private manufacture, research and develop-          ment of designs and inventions are hampered;   (xii) that the  system of private manufacture leads to  the disclosure of          information of a national value which it is in the national interest          to retain ;  and   (xiii) that private manufacturers are unable to provide  for the  expansion          necessitated by war,  that the  potential expansion represented by          exports is of little  value and that  nationalisation is ultimately          inevitable.  Very little evidence has been laid before us  to support the positive statement that armament firms  have endeavoured to stimulate  a demand  for their products by means of propaganda and  the dissemination of false reports ;the case presented  has been  founded mainly  upon inferences which it iscontended should be drawn  from the nature of the trade.  It has,  however,  been contended     that private manufacturers of arms as now operating have a  direct      incentive to arm nations in preparation for war;    that the selling of arms for profit contributes  to  the keeping alive of      that kind of feeling between nations that  leads to war ;* League of Nations Doct. No. A.81.1921.  C321.1921.
    that competitive private manufacture promotes the perfection of weapons      and thus causes governments to increase expenditure on war prepara-      tion  which they justify by war propaganda ;    that private manufacture is a predisposing cause of war in that the more      strained  international relations  become,  the  better  it  is  for  the      armaments firms whose  profits are dependent  on increased sales of      armaments ;    that vested interests, through the medium of the press have been guilty      of the constant inflaming of public opinion ;  and    that inasmuch as increased sales of  armaments abroad  must lead to      increased  armaments at  home a vicious circle is  created which it is      in the natural interest of armament manufacturers to enlarge.  The incident almost universally cited by witnesses in support of the charge that armament manufacturers stimulate expenditure by propaganda and the dissemination of false reports is that of Col. Mulliner and the action he tookin 1906 and 1909 in an endeavour to persuade the British Government to accelerate their naval  programme.   Particulars of this incident are set outfully in Appendix V, and it is unnecessary therefore to repeat them here.  No one has suggested that an armament firm carrying on business abroad Bribery.or in this country has attempted to bribe a government official of this country or that a government official has ever accepted a  bribe.  A number of witnesses have, however,  endeavoured to associate with thequestion of bribery,  what has been described as the subtle custom adoptedby  armament firms of appointing  to  their directorates,  officials  of highstanding on their retirement from government  service.  Three evils are suggested in connection with this custom     that the officials appointed will be able to exert their influence with      their late  colleagues in official quarters to secure for their firms orders      which might in other circumstances be placed elsewhere ;    that firms are enabled  to secure favour in  official quarters  by holding      out to serving officers the inducement of remunerative employment      on retirement from the government service ;    that serving officers may be tempted to place themselves in an equivocal      position towards firms by which it is their hope or desire to be employed      when they leave the service.  As evidence of bribery abroad there has been cited to us     the correspondence cited  before the Special  Committee  of the United      States  Senate which  has  been investigating the  munitions industry      in that country ; and    the case, of  which particulars are given in Appendix V, of the Japanese      Admiral who was found guilty in 1914 of accepting a payment from a      British armament firm as consideration for an order given.  No witness has produced evidence to support the allegation that the press Use ofin this country is utilised by the armaments industry as a means of improperly the press.influencing  public opinion in the matter of armaments.  Attention has, however, been directed to, and it has thereby been suggested,that there is an  ulterior motive behind the facts     that armament firms and leaders of the armaments industry hold shares      in newspaper companies ; and    that newspaper  correspondents abroad have  in certain cases acted      simultaneously as foreign agents of armament firms.  Special mention has also been made of the trade and  technical press, andstress has been laid on the facts-    that certain technical journals have been in the habit of devoting undue       space to the advertisements of British armament firms ;  and    that British journals devoted to aviation have almost without exception       taken  a strong line against disarmament  because, so it  is  claimed,       they could not live without the sale of military aircraft.
               As to the press abroad it has been alleged                  that there is a much more direct association with armament interests                   as evidenced, for example, by the fact that a direct change in the policy                   of certain important French newspapers in the matter of advocating                   increased armaments can. be traced from the date when these  were                   acquired or partially acquired by important steel interests in France                   which are largely concerned in armament production.Creation of      The term &quot; armament ring &quot; is used  by the critics of private manufacturearmament    m two senses.  In the first sense it denotes a national or international combinerings.        D:f manufacturers which is said to exist for the purpose of forcing governments             to pay inflated prices for armaments.  In the  second sense the allusion is             to a plot or conspiracy of an international  character which is said to  exist             as between the armament makers of the world to play one country off against             another by inducing governments to purchase arms on the pretext that they             are needed in order to counteract  purchases by  other governments.               In support of the first of these allegations our attention has been directed             to the  virtual monopoly enjoyed in the United  Kingdom  by  Vickers,  Ltd.,             in the supply of certain heavy armaments,  and to the pre-eminent position             of Imperial Chemical Industries,  Ltd., in regard to the  supply of  certain             explosive products.   It has been asserted                  that the monopolistic character of the trade carried on by these two                   companies  in conjunction with  their subsidiary and associated  firms                   enables  them to  dictate prices to the government  and so to exploit                   the taxpayer for the benefit of  private interests ;                 that this price-raising process may be and sometimes is disguised  by                   the expedient of  splitting up a profit  and charging it in part to  the                   finished article and in part to materials or components  produced at                   an intermediate stage  by a subsidiary or associated firms ; and                 that price-raising rings of this nature operate not only nationally but                   also internationally and adopt  such methods as collusive tendering                   in order to eliminate competition.               In this latter connection stress has been laid on the fact  that both Vickers,             Ltd., and Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., either own or  are materially             interested in concerns engaged  in the manufacture of similar products in             the British  Empire and in  foreign  countries.  Tabular statements  and             diagrams have  been submitted to  us which purported to detail the ramifi-             cations of these two firms and to show  the close contact which exists between             them and kindred concerns in Europe and the United States of America.               We have also been referred to the evidence adduced before the Special             Committee of the United States Senate  in which Imperial Chemical Industries,.             Ltd.,  were stated  to  have  21  foreign  alliances and foreign investments             in 30 companies, and Vickers to have  subsidiary or associated companies in             4  Dominions  and  8 foreign countries.  Our attention  has been directed             in particular to an agreement between Vickers, Ltd., and the Electric Boat Co.             of the  United States of America, which regulated the use of  the Electric             Boat Co.&apos;s patents in the construction of submarines  and provided for  the             payment to the Electric Boat Co. of 40 per cent, of the profits on submarines             built in Great  Britain by Vickers, Ltd., and for the division of profits on             those built elsewhere.   This  agreement, it is said, was utilised by the two-             firms to increase prices  to governments.               A further charge that has  been made which can conveniently be referred             to at this point is that the alleged monopolistic combines are supported and,             in some instances, are controlled by banks or other powerful financial interests.             It has  been asserted that by means of interlocking directorships or loans,             close relationships have been established between  certain armament firms             and financial houses.  We were referred in particular to the relations between             Vickers, Ltd., and Glyn Mills and Co. and the Sun Insurance Co., respectively.
59168also to the arrangement by which it was alleged that the Law DebentureCorporation were in control of the business of William Beardmore &amp; Co., Ltd.  The making of profit out of war and preparation for war has been described The makingto us as the major evil of private manufacture, and witnesses who have appeared of profit outbefore us as advocates of the prohibition of private manufacture have, almost 01 war--without exception, referred to the  subject, not so much on the  ground thatarmament manufacturers are more guilty than others of  profiteering at thepublic expense in  time of war,  although this is  alleged,  but chiefly on theground that  it is wrong from the ethical standpoint that a system should obtain whereby profits are made out of the supply of killing power to theworld.  It has been said      that armament firms are not in themselves an actual proximate motive       of war but that the selling of armaments for profit contributes to the       keeping  alive of the kind of frame of mind between nations which       leads to quarrels ;     that the  trade in armaments is not worse than other  trades; the evil of       it lies in the fact that financial interests should exist which are dependent       on war ;     that the incentive of profit-making  must tend to make private manu-       facturers seek to induce governments to spend more on armaments,       whereas  under  a  state  monopoly of  armaments  manufacture the       interests of the  state would lie in the opposite direction ;     that public quotations  of  shares of armament  firms show how these       benefit from tension in international affairs or from the announcement       of programmes of armaments expansion ;  in this connection we have,       as an  example,  had our  especial attention  directed  to  the  upward       movement in the value  of  the shares  of aircraft  companies  in this       country, following the adoption of the  expanded Air Force in 1934,       and to the fact that there was an upward movement (stated to amount       to ^30,000,000) in the value of armament shares, following the issue       of the  Government White Paper on Defence in March, 1936, notwith-       standing the statements made  in that paper as to  the governments       intention to  restrict profits  to be made out of  the re-armament       programme.  Many who  do not support the nationalisation of the manufacture of armsand  munitions  of war  nevertheless take  the view  that it is wrong that asystem should  continue under which uncontrolled  profits can be made by private manufacturers, and they have urged that some form of control (ratheron the lines of  that at present exercised over public utility undertakings oron some similar lines) should be exercised over the profits of private manu-facturers of armaments.  Two recent happenings have been  cited to us as evidence that, in theirendeavours to dispose of their products, manufacturers and traders in armsact as suppliers  of arms  to both  sides in disputes,  thereby prolonging warswhich, in other circumstances, could not be continued.  We have been told     thatswhilst the League of Nations was endeavouring to settle the dispute      between Bolivia  and  Paraguay private  manufacturers  of  arms  in      Europe and America, including those in this country, were engaged in      supplying arms to each of the parties to the dispute ;  and    that British armament firms provided the Japanese  with war material      for use against the Chinese in  1932, despite the condemnation of the      Japanese aggression into Manchuria by the League of  Nations.  As evidence of the allegation  that the system of private manufacture andtrade  is calculated to lead to the supply of arms to a potential enemy, aThe supplyof arms toopposingarmies andpotentialenemies.
Disturbanceof inter-nationalrelationsandinterferencewith peaceanddisarmamentefforts.number of witnesses have referred to the fact that guns used by the Turksagainst British troops at the Dardanelles were found to have been of Britishmanufacture.  No witness that has appeared before us has openly asserted that any Britisharmament manufacturer  has directly endeavoured to disturb international relations or pursue a policy hostile to disarmament.  It has, however, been asserted.     that the mere existence of a private vested interest in the manufacture       and sale of armaments is  in itself a factor calculated to disturb inter-       national relations ;  and    that the failure of successive attempts to secure international agreement       on disarmament can be traced to indirect influence exerted by those       engaged in or interested in the supply of munitions of war.  As  evidence  of direct action our attention has been repeatedly called     to the activities of Mr. W. B. Shearer, a citizen  of the United States of       America, who attended the Naval Conference of 1927, ostensibly  as       an observer but actually, it is claimed, as a hired agent of the Bethlehem       Steel Corporation of the United  States  of America, charged with the       duty of exercising his influence to ensure that a minimum of success       attended the  attempts of the Conference to secure agreement on       disarmament ;  and    to certain of the correspondence between armament firms abroad, which       was laid before  the United States Senatorial Committee,  which  it is       asserted is indicative of  a desire on  the part of  armament  manu-       facturers to hamper  attempts to secure international  agreement  on       disarmament.  To show the kind of indirect action to which armament firms  resort in an endeavour to ensure the continuance of a demand for their products, reference has been made to the support given by them to such bodies as the Air Leagueof the British  Empire, the National Aerial  Defence Association,  and theHands Off Britain Air Defence  League, which bodies, it has been  asserted,are used by the armament firms as a  means  of  exerting indirect  influence in favour  of increased national  armaments.Solicitation     The accusers of the industry, without citing any specific instance in which and touting   a British armament manufacturer has taken such action, have asserted thatfor orders.    armament manufacturers are not content to seek new markets merely by the             advertisement of their wares,  but that  they make direct approaches  to             governments in endeavours to secure orders in excess of advertised programmes             in the  knowledge or hope that any additional  orders secured will  lead to             additional  orders from other countries :  in  fact that they  endeavour  to             create a fear market.The develop-ment of research,design, andinvention inprivatehandsand ingovernmentestablish-ments.  A considerable volume of evidence has  been laid before  us designed toshow that the  manufacture  of armaments  ought  to be concentrated ingovernment hands  because nationalisation of manufacture  would promote the development of research,  design and invention.  It has been argued                                          *     that  centralisation of research work under  a unified control prevents       dissipation of effort;     that a closer contact between research and experimental  work is possible       in  government  establishments, which have  greater  facilities  than       private establishments for experiment;     that  money is more  readily made available for research in government       establishments, where there is not that necessity to visualise a prospect       of  dividend on capital that,there is in the case of private enterprise ;
                                  61                                  167    that it may not always be to the advantage of a private manufacturer      to develop a new invention, for example, if it were one calculated to      reduce the selling value of an article or to render existing costly plant      obsolete ;    that the interests of the state may be prejudiced as a result  of  this      conflict of interest; and that the motive of profit-making is calculated      to lead private manufacturers to favour  large  scale contracts for      standard products rather than incur the expense involved in developing      new ideas.  Development and adoption of inventions during the War by the Ministryof Munitions (notably the tank, the Stokes  bomb, the Mills hand-grenade,the paravane, and the substitute propellant) have been cited  in support ofthe contention that a central department under the government is better able than private industry to make use of or develop new ideas in the national interest.  Advocates  of  the prohibition  of  private  manufacture  have urged thatsecrecy, e.g.,  in regard to improvements in designs and types of armaments and in regard to naval and military  plans could be better  maintained if theproduction of munitions of war were  concentrated  in  government  hands,and that the continuance of a private trade in arms is  calculated to resultin information of military value going abroad,  and  the supply to  foreign nations of new and improved weapons which it  is in the national interest for the country to retain for its own use.Thedisclosuresecretinformationof  It has been urged     that without government organisation  and assistance private industry      cannot itself command a sufficient control  over  supplies of material,      labour and machinery,  or secure the proper distribution of these for      purposes of war expansion ;   and    that it is only by means  of centralised control  that the manuafcturing      resources of the country can be rapidly and  fully mobilized to meet      the needs of war.  These contentions are supported by reference to the shortage of munitionswhich occurred in the early days  of  the Great War when contracts were placed with private  manufacturers which it was beyond  their capacity to fulfil and  it has been argued  that  unless plans are  prepared in peace timefor  the  organisation and  co-ordination of the various branches  of private industry that are concerned in the production of war supplies those experienceswill recur in the future in any war of major importance.  One witness,  who  has  devoted much time and thought to the  study ofthis subject, expressed the  views     that the additional reserve manufacturing  capacity resulting from  the      maintenance of an export trade is negligible when compared with the      expansion needed for war purposes ;    that it could in any case be  made good by adding to the plant now      maintained in government factories  which could be done at a very      low cost; and    that as power to expand in war time depends  really on the plant  the      government maintains by means of the orders it places in peace time,      it matters not whether this  plant remains  in government  or private      hands.  Another witness, who based his views on  experience gained as Minister ofMunitions during the War, urged that national control of the production ofmunitions is inevitable in a major war and that it is better, therefore, to nationalise in peace time rather than attempt to effect a change over on an outbreak of war.The inability of privatemanufac-turers toprovidefor warexpansion.
          3. Arguments in favour of retaining Private Manufacture   We propose  first to  summarise  the primary arguments that have been advanced in favour of the  retention  of  private manufacture and then to indicate briefly the answers that have been returned to the evidence advanced in favour of the abolition of private manufacture.   The principal ground on which the  retention of private manufacture has been defended is that it is an essential  feature of the national defence system of the country.   It has been claimed      that to prohibit  private manufacture would deprive the country of an       essential part of its war potential  which could not be  entirely made       good in  other directions even were the country  prepared to face the       considerable  additional expense that would be involved ;     that under the existing system reserve equipment is maintained by the       private firms and  a  reserve of skilled labour is  available that can       be utilised immediately to augment existing supplies of war  material       on an outbreak of war ;     that the export  trade maintained by  the private  firms  in peace time       provides a reserve for  war purposes  and meanwhile  reduces  the       overhead costs of reserve maintenance ;     that  nationalisation  of  armament  production   would  involve  the       government  in responsibility for  the maintenance of this reserve,       a reserve moreover which, under national ownership, would be largely       maintained in idleness having regard to the objections  that would be       raised against  the  entry of  the government into an export  trade in       armaments or the manufacture of alternative non-armament products       in competition with private  industry ;     that maintenance of reserve manufacturing capacity by the government       would be costly even making allowance for the  fact that under the       existing system the government already pay for it, to some extent,       in the prices paid  to the armament firms  and by reason of certain       direct subsidies paid to ensure the  maintenance of plant which could       not otherwise be maintained  by  the private firms  ;     that maintenance of  reserve capacity  by the government  would still       not ensure the availability of the  essential reserve of  skilled labour       which the private firms are  able to retain by the utilisation of their       employees on export orders  and non-armament work;     that in many branches of armament work, e.g.,  in the chemical and       aircraft industries,  experience gained  on civilian  work of  a similar       category is beneficial;  and     that to deprive the aircraft firms  of experience in the manufacture of       military  aircraft  would prejudicially  affect the development of civil       aircraft.   The argument that the retention of private manufacture is essential in-the interests of national defence is  one that had been urged upon us, in themost emphatic terms, not only by the Secretary to the Committee of ImperialDefence, but also by representatives of the three service  departments and by-certain other retired officers who volunteered to appear  before us and whom we thought it right to hear because of their previous experience in co-ordinatingand organising supplies of munitions of war, both under peace time and wartime conditions.   All of these were  agreed that the  needs of the country on an outbreak ofwar could be met only by the retention of  private manufacture, coupled withthe  formulation in  peace  time of plans to  ensure the  rapid  and effective&quot;mobilisation of private industry to supplement state manufacture.   Various schemes have1 been  propounded to us for purposes of securing theiullest use  of the private manufacturing resources of  the country on an outbreak of war.
  As  to the  evidence advanced in  favour of  the abolition  of private manufacture   Those who  support  the continuance of private  manufacture have sub- Allegations ofmitted that no case has  been made out to show that armament  firms in propaganda,general, and still less the armament firms in this country, engage in propaganda etc.and the dissemination of false reports to stimulate  armament expenditure.  It is admitted that in certain countries abroad bribes may have been given Allegationsby agents to  obtain orders.                                                of bribery.  It is contended however     that such bribes are only given to secure an order as against a competitor      and not to create  an order ;    that if agents resort  to bribery to secure orders it is  done without the      knowledge or connivance  of  the armament firms  and is paid for out      of the  agents&apos; commission ;    that this commission is in  any case  insufficient to permit of bribery      on  any considerable scale ;    that nationalisation would not do away with bribery because it would      still be resorted to by governments (eg.,  by extorting promises of      political support in exchange for  the fulfilment of armament contracts) ;      and    that bribery in any event is not a factor calculated to have any appreciable      effect on the world  supply of armaments.  For example it has been urged     that a shadow ministry of  munitions should be  set up in  peace time      by creating a skeleton personnel  whose duty it should be to  create      on paper an organisation for munitions supply  ready to be put into      operation immediately on an outbreak of war ;    that a &quot; laboratory arsenal &quot;  should be set up in peace time  charged      with the duty of conducting research  and experiment to ensure that      munitions of war are of the  best type and design and capable  of being      produced rapidly in  large quantities and  so far as possible on mass      production  methods ;    that a permanent  supervisory body should be set up responsible for      organising war material supplies ;    that reserves  of  materials  necessary for the production of munitions      of war  should  be accumulated by the government  who  should also      provide and equip reserve  munition factories in areas remote from      aerial attack.  For a  fuller elaboration of these proposals we invite a  reference to the published Minutes  of the Evidence taken before the  Commission  (Day 5,pp.  140-141 ;  Day 9, p. 227 ; Day 11, p. 313 ;  Day  11a,  pp. 7-9  and 11  ;and Day 15, pp. 442 and 446).  Another argument that has been advanced in favour of the  retention ofprivate manufacture is the fact that non-producing states are to-day largelyreliant upon the private manufacturers in producing states for their supplies ofarmaments.  All states need armaments for defence purposes and if prevented from securing  them from one source they would inevitably seek alternative sources.  Unilateral abolition of private manufacture would, it is said, merelydrive non-producing states to seek alternative suppliers.   General abolitionwould necessitate the setting up of armament factories  by the non-producingstates, thereby increasing the potential world supply of armaments a resultcontrary to that desired by all or alternatively the seeking of supplies fromother producing states with the inevitable danger that political ties  wouldresult which would in themselves become dangers to peace.
               The  official  witnesses have stoutly  denied the prevalence of bribery in             official  quarters.               They have contended                  that the machinery of the departments is such as to preclude the existence                   of bribery ;                 that the fact that officials responsible for placing  armament contracts                   have no responsibility for, nor connection with,  the determination of                   purchase programmes, and the fact that  contracts of  any magnitude                   are  subject to ministerial authority make it impossible that officials                   could  be  induced,  through bribery, to  embark  upon purchase                   programmes that might not otherwise be undertaken ;  and                 that the system of secret competitive tender  which obtains except as                   regards  special classes of armaments for which no alternative sources                   of supply are available,  coupled with the supervision over prices which                   results  from  independent audit makes it impossible  for  officials to                   show favour to individual firms.Use of the      Representatives of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association (a body repre-press.        sentative of all the leading daily and Sunday journals in this country) have             informed us -                 that there is no ground whatever for the suggestion that newspapers are                   identified with firms manufacturing armaments in  this country in                   such a  manner as would justify the suggestion  that  newspapers are                   used for the purpose of advocating increased armaments ;                 that in so far  as  opinions  are expressed by  newspapers  in favour of                   increased national armaments these  are  unbiased and  unprejudiced                   expressions of opinion ;  and                 that from  the economic point of view alone, it would be contrary to their                   interests to adopt and  advocate a policy calculated to lead  to war,                   because  the  increased  costs of the  raw materials  alone  used by                   newspapers, which result from war, to say nothing of the loss which is                   experienced in advertising revenue, far outweighs any increased revenue                   that might result from increased sales.               As to the simultaneous appointment of foreign agents of armament firms             as press correspondents we  have  been informed  that whenever this  has             occurred the individual in question has been appointed as a local or occasional             correspondent  to assist the permanent staff correspondents maintained in             the countries in question, and that he has been  unable  in any  way to exert             influence upon the policy of the paper in question.               The  armament firms  have denied that  they have  connecting financial             interests with  the press or that foreign agents  have ever been  appointed             because of any connection they might have with  newspapers abroad.               The existence of price-raising rings either of a national or an international             character has been denied by the witnesses who have given evidence on behalf             of the  British armament firms, although they  admitted their membership             of certain cartels or combines operating in the United Kingdom and in some             instances also  in foreign countries.               They stated                  that arrangements which  at first sight might appear to  be price-raising                   rings are in fact designed to protect manufacturers against uneconomic                   undercutting of prices or else to safeguard the supply of raw materials,                   such as  nickel, at a reasonable cost;                 that much of the evidence laid before us  as to  the ramifications of                   Vickers, Ltd., and Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., was inaccurate ;                 that in  certain instances  these  two  firms either  never held the alleged                   interest in other firms  or had ceased to hold it at the  date of  our                   inquiry;Existence ofarmamentrings.
    that in one case at any rate the  interest  had been  acquired at the       instigation  of  the government ;  in other cases it  represented the       settlement of a bad debt due from  the concern in which the interest       was  acquired ;    that in other instances the agreements with  foreign firms related solely       to industrial products of a non-warlike character ;  and    that with a solitary exception they did  not possess any  interest in a       foreign firm which would enable them  to  control its activities/ The       exception referred to was  the  case  of  the interest of Vickers,  Ltd.,       in the Placencia de las Armas, a small company employing 250 hands,       whose sole customer is the Spanish Government.  Both the armament firms and the official witnesses assured us that themachinery  which operates  in connection with the placing  of  contracts forarmaments in the United Kingdom is  so designed, either by means of com-parison with dockyard and arsenal costs or by means of independent investi-gation  of manufacturers&apos;  costs, as to preclude the payment of inflated prices by the  government.  The  armament firms denied  that they  attempted to  obtain exorbitantprices or that the actual profit made by them could  be concealed by attri-buting  any part of  it to intermediate processes of  manufacture.  they stated  that any device of this kind, if employed,  would be  detected by the experts charged  by the government with the  investigation  of prices.  All the witnesses appearing on behalf of the  armament  firms  expressedthe willingness of their firms to submit to such investigation of their costingsand prices as might be deemed by the government to be necessary.  As to the alleged existence of international agreements to play one countryoff against another, no direct evidence has been produced, but we have been invited to  deduce  it,  partly from  the existence  of monopolistic  interests,and partly from certain letters  which  were  produced before  the SpecialCommittee  of the Senate in the United  States of America.  The witnessesappearing before us on behalf of the armament firms in the United Kingdomdenied  that they were  parties or ever had  been parties to any  such agreementseither with  the firms of Schneider of Skoda or any of the other foreign firms which had been mentioned.  They also denied that any of the letters producedto the  American Committee disclosed activities  of such a  nature  or  were capable of interpretation  in that sense.  As to the connections between  armament firms and financial interests,the firms concerned have  informed us that the arrangements  in question were of a  normal business  character  and arose  out of the  fact  that precariousfinancial positions had at one time made  it necessary to obtain assistance on terms involving submission to a certain  degree of outside control.   In thecase of  William Beardfhore  &amp; Co., Ltd., and the Law Debenture Corporationit was  pointed  out that  the  documents embodying the arrangement  werefiled at the  Joint Stock Registry and were,  therefore, public  property.  Those who defend the existing system have submitted     that nationalisation  Of armament  manufacture would not prevent the The     making of profit out of war because it is not the armament firms making of     alone that are guilty of this ;                                         profit    that there is as much  of more profit to be made out of the  supply  of out of war     metals  and  other  materials  used by the   armament manufacturers     themselves, or out of the supply to the services of such requirements     as foodstuffs, medical stores or clothing, which are essential if an army     is to  be maintained in the field;   that the armament firms do not derive additional profits but of a war     to any greater extent than other trading concerns ;   that there is therefore no justification for singling  out this particular     industry for  special treatment apart  from the steps which are already     taken, as part  of the normal procedure, to check  inflated  prices in     the placing of armament contracts  ;
The supplyof arms toopposingarmies, etc.InterferenceWITHdisarmamentefforts.Solicitationand toutingfor orders.     that nationalisation would not remove this particular evil in that there       would, under a state monopoly, be the danger that the incentive of       profit-making would lead governments to seek markets for the output       of their arsenals ; and     that the potential dangers of such an eventuality (e.g., the creation of       political  alliances  in return for  guaranteed  supplies of armaments)       are more objectionable than those arising from the making of profit       by private enterprise.   It is denied that a  private trade in arms itself leads  to the prolongation of wars by reason of  the supply of arms to opposing armies and potential enemies.   It is claimed      that prohibition of private manufacture would not deter non-producing       nations from resorting to war;  and     that it would merely force them to set up  factories of their own, thereby       increasing the potential world supply of armaments,  or lead them to       form political alliances in return for  assurances as to the supply of       armaments  from other governments an equally objectionable evil.  As to the allegations  made in regard to the Bolivia-Paraguay war,  andthe Japanese aggression into Manchuria, it is claimed that the export licensing system affords the means  whereby exports can be stopped without resort to the more drastic course of prohibiting private manufacture, and the fault,if any, lies at the door of  those responsible for administering the licensing system.  As to the references that  have  been made  to the  British manufacturedguns that were  used  against British troops  at the Dardanelles it has  been said      that there were 13 only of these out of a total of 234 Turkish guns used       in the campaign ; and     that, leaving aside the  emotional  aspect of the question, it might  have       proved of advantage for British manufacturers to have supplied the       whole of the  guns  as accurate  knowledge would then  have  been       available as to the  stocks  of  ammunition held by  the  Turks  who,       in their  turn,  would not have been  able to renew their supplies of       ammunition so  readily.   Those who favour the continuance  of private manufacture, and who  have dealt with this  aspect of the alleged  objection to the system, have claimed that the Shearer incident was not  in any material  measure responsible forthe failure of the Naval Conference.   It is also pointed out that Mr. Shearerwas  not the agent of a purely armament firm, but of an  iron and steel  trustwhich  would have  been equally at liberty to pursue its propaganda if the armament firms had been nationalised. Stress is also laid on the fact that itis the only concrete instance  which advocates of prohibition have been ableto produce of a direct attempt by a firm or corporation interested in themanufacture of armaments or materials for  armaments to  interfere  withdisarmament efforts.  On behalf Of  the armament  firms it  has  been denied that any financial support  given to  the so-called patriotic societies has  been given  in  anyinstance, with any ulterior motive.  As to the suggestion  that armament manufacturers seek to  stimulate  ademand for their products by creating a fear market it has been contended      that nations do  not add to their armaments at the instigation of the       armament manufacturers ;     that armaments are the result of  fear created by international distrust;       and     that the creation of an improved understanding between nations is the       only method whereby to secure a reduction in world armaments.
170of research,design, etc.   The  armament firms have denied that  they ever indulge  in touting for orders in the manner suggested and they have assured us that it is only when it is known that a government is in the market for armarrients that endeavours are made to secure that the orders that are to be placed are given to British firms.   It has been denied that the development of research, design, and invention The in  the matter  of armaments would  be  facilitated by the nationalisation of development the industry.                                                                     .....   We have been told      that  research work is cramped within  government  departments;     that in peace time at any rate,  money  for research work is more readily       made available by private industry than by the government ;     that if the supply of war material were left to government establishments       the result would be the production of material of a sound type but of       average mediocrity because, in the government service, the atmosphere       and conditions do not favour the development of new ideas ;    that  inasmuch  as discovery,  research and the development  of  new       ideas result  from  individual effort they  do not lend themselves to       centralised organisation ;    that under private manufacture there is  competition between firms and       a strong  incentive to individuals to find new  and improved devices      which will not only help the  firms for  whom they work but will also      improve their personal  positions in the  firms, whereas government      employees do not seek to assume additional responsibilities or incur      the  risk of putting  forward new ideas  which may be regarded as      impracticable in higher quarters ;    that research conducted by  commercial undertakings in non-military      matters is likely to result in discoveries that are of military value ;      and    that when  considering the case  of the tank it should not be overlooked      that the idea of the tank emanated  in the  first instance  not from a      government establishment  or a government  employee,  but  from a      private  engineering firm who placed the idea  in  government hands      for  development.  As to the relative merits of  private and  state manufacture, vis-a-vis the employee,  evidence has  been laid before us  to  show that both in private industry and in state establishments there  is  machinery in vogue  to-secureto employees a share of whatever reward may result from the developmentof new ideas conceived by employees in the course of their work.  We have been assured,  both by the official witnesses and others whom we the whole examined, that adequate means exist  to ensure the protection of new disclosure ofand secret inventions and that, even if an armament firm desired to reveal secret information of military value to a person abroad the penalties that would be information.involved would far  outweigh any  possible advantage  that might accrue tothe firm.  Our attention has been directed, in this connection                         :    to the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts, which are extremely wide      in their application ;    to the machinery  of the export licensing system, which, although  not      designed  for the purpose, nevertheless  affords a means whereby  the      government can check exports if it is not considered in the national      interest to allow particular classes of armaments to go abroad ;  and    to arrangements which are in force between the Air Ministry and firms      engaged in the manufacture of aircraft  in this country, by which the      Ministry  are consulted and their prior consent is obtained  before any      order for the supply of military aircraft abroad is  accepted,  and any      licence to manufacture abroad is granted.
4. The Arguments For and Against the Abandonment of Private Manufacture                    by this Country acting Unilaterally  Witnesses  who  are  agreed that the private manufacture of armamentsought to be  abolished do not  all take the  view that it would be right forthis country  alone to abolish private manufacture in the absence of general international agreement to take similar action.  We have been told      that  inasmuch as this country is  one  of  the  largest  exporters of      armaments it should set a world  example  by abolishing  private      manufacture ;     that the private manufacture of and trade in armaments is comparable      with the slave trade, and that just as this country set an example to      the world in the abolition of the slave trade, so in the matter of  the      private manufacture of armaments  for profit it ought  to  show  the      world  that it is prepared to sacrifice whatever benefit there is to be      derived from  a private trade in armaments ;     that nationalisation even  by one country would help to diminish  the      incidence of war and anything which reduces the incidence of war is      worth  doing ;  and     that if this country were to abolish  private manufacture others would      be certain to follow the example.  On. the other hand it has been argued -     that a decision by this country  to  abstain  from participating in  the      trade would not result in any diminution of the world supply of arms      as what this  country  ceased to supply  would inevitably  be supplied      from some other country ;     that unilateral abolition of private manufacture would merely result in      the sacrifice of employment  for British labour, jeopardise the  defence      system of the country, which depends to so large an extent on  the      maintenance of the private  manufacturing resources  of the country,      and  open the door for others to enter into the trade who would not      conduct the business with the care and control that is  exercised by      this country ;  and     that it would be a sacrifice not worth  making in that it could not but      fail to achieve its object of reducing the. world supply of armaments      and thereby the risk of war.                      5. The Export Control System  The following paragraphs  contain a summary of the  evidence that hasbeen laid before us under Part 3 of our terms of reference, which require usto examine and report  upon the present arrangements in force in the UnitedKingdom relative to the control of the export trade in arms and munitions of war.  As to the origin and  purpose  of the system at present in force under whichcontrol over exports is exercised in this country we have been told      that the present arrangements for controlling the export of arms  and      munitions of  war are the direct outcome of a prohibition  that  was      instituted on  the outbreak of the Great War against the export of      arms and other materials that might have been utilised against  this      country and its allies ;     that since the War a licensing system, adapted from time to time to      meet changing conditions and circumstances, has continued to operate      in respect of the export of arms and munitions of war ;  and     that whilst the  system has found other uses, such as  facilitating the      imposition of  embargoes, it  has been utilised in the main to enable      the country to play its part by virtue of  its participation in certain
171generallicences.in force    One permits of the export, under certain conditions, to all destinations      other than Abyssinia, of aircraft assembled or dismantled and aircraft      engines,  and also bayonets,  swords and lances and component parts      thereof.   By virtue  of  this  open general licence,  aircraft  (apart      from any armament they may carry)  can thus be exported without      licence but there is an arrangement in  force between the Air Ministry      and the aircraft manufacturing firms which ensures to  the Air Ministry      full knowledge and control of all exports of aircraft from this country.    A second open general licence  permits  of  the  export, under certain      conditions, to all destinations other than  certain lands and maritime      zones in Africa  and Asia, of smooth bore  shot  guns and ammunition      for use therewith and also  certain brands of  smokeless gunpowder      and certain types of explosives.    The third  open  general  licence enables persons who  hold  fire-arms      certificates,  to take  abroad without obtaining a specific  licence,  fire-      arms  and ammunition described in the fire-arms certificate.    For a more detailed history of the origin and development of the licensing system,  the texts of the enactments giving legislative authority to the system and of the prohibition order issued thereunder,  reference is invited to a memo-randum prepared by the Board of  Trade in collaboration with the ForeignOffice, Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and Board of Customs and Excisewhich has been reproduced as Appendix I to our published Minutes of Evidencefor the 12th Day.  There will also be found appended to those Minutes (Appendix II) a memorandum by the Admiralty explaining the control  which is exercised over thebuilding and equipment of warships by private firms in this country.  The licensing system has been criticised -    as an inefficient means of controlling exports  of war material and useless Criticisms      as a means of preventing the evils which are alleged to obtain by the advanced      maintenance  of  a private trade in arms ;                             and reforms    on the ground  that aircraft are permitted to  be  exported  under open advocated.      general licence,  it being alleged  in  this connection that there is      nothing to prevent the unrestricted export  of aircraft which can be      subsequently armed  and converted to military  purposes ;    as affording no protection against the passing on  of orders abroad on a      commission basis,  or  the setting up of factories for the manufacture      or assembly of articles abroad where it might prove difficult to secure      a licence to export them from this country ;  and      international treaties; in: regulating  the  international: traffic in&apos; arms      by preventing arms from&apos; reaching native races, subversive elements,      and&apos;disarmed ex-enemy countries.  As to the powers and machinery under which the existing licensing system Powers andis enforced we have been informed                                        machinery    that by virtue of provisions contained in the Customs and Inland Revenue, enforcecj      Act, 1879,  the Exportation of Arms Act, 1900 and  the Finance  Act,-      1921,  orders have  from time  to time  been issued prohibiting  the      export from this country,  except  under licence,  of  certain classes of      arms and munitions of war ;    that the current operative order is the Arms Export Prohibition Order,      1931 ; and    that certain open general licences have been issued permitting the export      of certain classes of arms and munitions  of war which  are covered      by the Arms Export Prohibition  Order and could  not otherwise be      exported except under a specific licence.  We have been informed  that  at present three  open  general  licences are Open
    on the ground that it is administered with a view to imposing a minimum       of  interference  on  trade  consistent with  retention  of control  over       exports and this it  is held results in the almost automatic  granting       of licences, refusal being restricted to those  cases where it would be       evidently disadvantageous to the country to grant a licence.  With a view to the improvement of and tightening up  of the  licensing system, if a private trade in arms is to be allowed to continue, it has  been urged     that particulars of licences granted  should be published promptly and       regularly;    that the manufacture as well as the export of arms and munitions of       war should be made the subject of licence ;    that  the  system should be extended to cover raw and semi-finished       materials capable of being converted to war uses ;    that manufacturers and dealers in armaments should  be licensed and       registered ;    that  machinery should  be introduced for controlling the granting  by       British manufacturers of licences to manufacture abroad.

   TO THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE MANUFACTURE OF                       AND  TRADING  IN  ARMS  We, the undersigned representatives of Christian Churches.in, Great Britainand Ireland, desire to express our conviction that the present system of themanufacture of and trade in arms is open to grave objection and is provocativeof war.  It is repugnant to Christian morality that the profits-of&apos;an industry should depend on the degree of suspicion andhostility which exists between nations,and a condition of things which makes this possible is not only objectionableon general principles, but adds to the difficulties of any attempts to make a peaceful settlement of the world.  Wehave been gravely disturbed by the allegations made that the armaments industry has used the power of its financial strength to impede the negotiation of treaties for the limitation and reduction of  armaments; that it has usedmeans of propaganda to keep alive such international alarms as  will increase its profits, and that, in some instances, armament firms have indulged inpractices which are indistinguishable from bribery and corruption to augmentthe sale of their goods.  In these circumstances,  although we are not in a position to deny or  affirmthese allegations  or to offer any evidence of a technical kind; we submit thefollowing representation-:     (1) We  believe  that the  manufacture of and trade in arms should be          controlled by international authority in such  a way as  would          include the fullest publicity of  all orders and the licensing of all          sales.     (2) We  believe that steps must be taken to eliminate private profits from         . the carrying-on  of this industry either by appropriate measures oi          restriction or control, or, if such measures proved to be inadequate,          by the.transfer  of the industry  to some public authority.     (3) We believe that the industry must be subject to such close inspection          by national and international authorities as may  prevent for the          future all.abuses in the  manufacture of and trade in arms.   In conclusion,  since it is the duty of Christian people to do all in their power to increase  the spirit of mutual confidence and  friendship among the nations, and to lessen the risks of war, we assure  the Commission that any efforts it may make  to prevent the abuses to which we  have alluded will have our whole-hearted support as a step to the general  reduction of armaments throughout the world.

It urges in particular the need for                               . .    (1) The restriction by adequate national control of private profits in        the arms industry, the  pursuit of  which is at present open to        grave objection and abuse.    (2) Provision  for such effective  national control of the industry as        might secure the fullest publicity in regard to the licensing and        sale of  arms.    (3) The  prevention of any possible future abuses  by providing for        unrestricted  inspection  of  the  industry   by  national  and        international authorities.

THE  ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE MANUFACTURE AND TRADE IN ARMSDear Sirs,  The following Resolution was passed by the Annual Synod of the MethodistChurch in Scotland held at Paisley on 8th and 9th inst.      &quot; This  Synod,  representing the Methodist Churches  in  Scotland,    expresses  its  conviction that the  private  trade  in Arms is  a direct    hindrance to peace among the nations and a stumbling-block in the way    of disarmament.      It therefore urges  the Royal  Commission  to  insist upon  adequate    national control of the manufacture of the munitions of war and effective    supervision  by competent international authority of  the armaments    industry.&quot;  I was  requested to forward a copy of the above to you.                                   I am,                                        Yours respectfully,                                              (Signed) William Woodley,NATIONAL  LEAGUE OF AIRMENPresident:  Captain Norman MacMillan, M.C., A.F.secretary :  G.

We should very much desire  to  be allowed  to inform the Chairman andmem bars of your Commission that  this  cannot refer to  the  National Leagueof Airmen for the following reasons : -      From its  inception the National League  of  Airmen has  refused on    principle to accept  any director or member of staff of the aircraft trade    into any category of membership, and has  not accepted, nor will accept,    any subscriptions or donations  whatsoever from any person or company    engaged in the aircraft manufacturing trade, other than air pilots and    ordinary employees on a wage  earning basis.  We trust that this method of bringing the matter to the notice  of theCommission is in order.

We have a large amount of evidence concerning public opinion on the private manufacture  of and trading  in  arms.   In general,  we would emphasise that     (1) in the answers  to the fourth question  in the National declaration with  is :               &quot; Should  the manufacture and sale of armaments for private            profit be prohibited by international agreement ? &quot;          93 - 0 per cent, of the voters in the Ballot have declared themselves          in  favour of  the prohibition.   The  average  poll for the  Ballot          from the  140  constituencies which have  so far sent  in complete          returns is 47 \ 1 per cent.
so.     (2) Peace Societies have naturally interested themselves very much in          the problem,  and  we  append a  record  of - resolutions  on  the          armaments traffic passed  at  central and local meetings of  the          societies and churches quoted.     (3) In addition, a very large number of Societies not specifically working          for peace, and with no political aims have considered the question          and passed resolutions on it.  The above churches. and societies  comprise, between them,  a very largeproportion of the  people of the  country.   In the main the quotations  arefrom. Headquarters  of groups  only.   In  addition,  resolutions  have beencontinually passed by Branches and  smaller groups of.all the organisations concerned in  different localities.RESOLUTIONS AND STATEMENTS ADOPTED BY THE FOLLOWING      ON  THE MANUFACTURE  OF  AND  TRADING IN ARMS  (Membership has been quoted where available.  It will be recognised that alarge  proportion of  these Organisations  are  non-party and are not peaceOrganisations.)CHURCHES  The Methodist Church.  (Membership  834,488  full adult  members.)  Adopted&apos;by the Methodist Conference, 1934 :   Addendum respecting the Private Manufacture and Sale of Arms.    (1) There  is incontrovertible evidence that the manufacture and sale of         arms for private profit constitute a serious menace to international         peace.    (2) In  view of  this fact, and  since  a  trade  interest in war  is utterly         abhorrent to the  Christian conscience,  the judgment  expressed         in  the  Conference  Declaration, on  Peace and War  should  be         emphasised :              &quot;We press  for  the  world-wide  reduction  of&quot;  armaments,           together with the  limitation and  control of their manufacture           and sale, anticipating the time of their complete abolition.&quot;    (3) In  the interests of world peace, private profit in the manufacture of         armaments should be eliminated.    (4) An embargo should be placed upon the supply of armaments by neutral         countries to countries engaged in war.    (5) Recognising  that international  agreement would  be necessary  to         make the  foregoing proposals completely effective,  the Conference         would urge in  respect of  both the  elimination of private profit         from the  manufacture  of armaments,  and  the  embargo upon         supply of  armaments to countries engaged in war  :            [a) That H.M. Government should seek to promote international                 agreement ;            (6) That, as a first step,  H.M. Government, on its own responsi-                 bility, should give effect, as far as this country is concerned,                 to these two proposals.    (6) The traffic in implements of war both depends  upon and seeks to         foster a public opinion not yet detached  from the sense of  the         necessity for war or armaments.  Nothing less than a new mentality         with regard to war and the idea of national sovereignty is capable         of  effecting  the - necessary change.   The need  is  for world-wide         moral disarmament,  and  for a recognition of  the binding claims         of justice and goodwill, which would remove the causes of war and         make armaments unnecessary.  Hence the existence of  the traffic         in arms is an urgent call for persistence in fulfilling the Church&apos;s         obligation to  promote peace and prevent war.&apos;
  The General Assembly of Unitarian andiBree Christian Churches.: [Approxi-mate- membership,  30,000, represented in 335 Churches in Great Britain andIreland)  Adopted by the  Annual Meeting of this Assembly, 28th April,  1934 -      That this Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, believing    that the system of private manufacture and sale  of armaments in the    pursuit of private profit is contrary to  the public interest and to inter-    national  peace,  urgently  calls  upon the  Government  to  take  such    measures as may bring this system  to an end.  Adopted by the Council of this Assembly, 19th October, 1934       That  this Council of the  General Assembly of Unitarian and  Free    Christian Churches, believing that  the  private trade in arms exercises    a sinister influence upon the efforts for disarmament and  is a direct    menace to peace, asks His Majesty&apos;s Government to appoint an impartial    and independent Commission of Inquiry into the trade in  arms, and    particularly  into the participation of British  firms in it, with full power    to make a complete and public investigation, having access to all evidence    and power to  call any witnesses.  The Congregational  Union of England and Wales.  (Membership 305,000.)  Passed by Assembly,  10th May  1934 -      The Assembly .  . . desires to call special attention to the danger    to peace which arises from the political influence of the financial interests    engaged in the private manufacture of armaments.  It begs the Govern-    ment to use every effort to secure the elimination of the motive of private    profit from the manufacture  of arms.      In addition, the Assembly urges  the  Government to use its utmost    influence through the  League  of Nations to secure an international    agreement for  the rigid control of the trade in armaments.  Passed by Assembly, 28th September,  1934       The Assembly is  profoundly shocked  by the disclosures which are    being made  at the  American Inquiry into the manufacture and sale of    arms.  Believing that the private trade  in armaments is a direct menace    to  Peace,  the  Assembly calls for the appointment of an impartial and    independent Commission of Inquiry, with full power to make a complete    and public investigation,  having access to all evidence and power  to    call any witness.  The London Congregational Union,  Women&apos;s League-  (Extract of letter from Mrs.  W.  M.  Rendall,  General Secretary,  dated    29th March,  1935)-      &quot; There have been many expressions  in our Council meetings against    the  private manufacture of and  traffic  in arms ....   It is apparent    that this is one of the biggest stumbling blocks to disarmament in the    world, and we should be glad to see our country take a lead  in putting    an end to it.&quot;  The General Conference of the New Church.  (Registered Membership, 5.96S.)  Passed at Annual Meeting, June, 1934      Resolved : that, believing international peace to be a supreme blessing    arising from the Christian religion,  and alarmed at the present  inter-    national situation, the 127th Annual Meeting of the New Church, held    at Radcliffe, Lancashire,  June,  1934, pledges support to the principle    of  international  co-operation, and   urges  His Majesty&apos;s  Government
immediately to initiate new efforts to attain such co-operation, even ifinvolving sacrifice,  and to make  determined efforts to secure a Con-vention involving the following :   (1) The application  of  the  principle that private profit  should be        eliminated from the manufacture and sale of arms ;  (2) The supervision and inspection of the  armaments of all nations,        including the manufacture and  sale of all arms and munitions,        under the authority of the Permanent Disarmament Commission.OTHER CHRISTIAN BODIES  Young Women&apos;s Christian Association.

Clubs and Branches that the following    postcard be sent to local Members  of Parliament :         &quot; I write to urge that the British Government shall accept President      Hoover&apos;s proposal for  a reduction of armaments by about one-third      and shall agree to the abolition by all nations,  of warships and sub-      marines, heavy guns and all tanks, military aircraft and the apparatus      of chemical warfare.        I urge also the abolition of the private manufacture of arms.&quot;  Resolution adopted by the Y.W.C.A. National  Council, July,  1935       The National Council  of the Young Women&apos;s Christian  Association    of Great Britain believes that it is of the  utmost importance that the    most stringent measures  to curtail the influence  of private  profits from    the  armaments industry  should be included in the Convention for the    Reduction  and Limitation of Armaments, and therefore  urges  H.M.    Government to press  for  the inclusion in this Convention  of measures    providing at least  for detailed publicity and  strict international  super-    vision of all manufacture, export and import of the armaments and war    materials permitted by the Convention to each State.  Resolution adopted by National Executive Committee, October, 1933       This  meeting of the  National  Executive Committee  of  the Young    Women&apos;s Christian Association urges H.M. Government to  do all in its    power to secure a successful issue to the Disarmament Conference when    it resumes work in October, and to push forward the drawing up and    signature of a Disarmament Convention.      The Convention  should be a minimum provided that there shall be :      (1) A  Permanent Disarmament  Commission  with  arrangements for           effective International Supervision of Disarmament  in  every           country, including International  Control of  manufacture and           trade in arms.

It  regrets that opposition has  been expressed by H.M. Government    to the provision  for  international  supervision  including  inspection    on the spot, and urges ELM.  Government to withdraw this objection    and to do all  in  its power to secure  the speedy acceptance of  the    Convention.      2.  The  National Council  for  Equal  Citizenship in Annual  Council    assembled welcomes the announcement  that H.M. Government intends    to institute an inquiry into the question of the manufacture  and sale    of armaments  and urges  that the Commission  appointed  to  conduct    the inquiry shall  (a) take evidence  on  oath  ;  (&amp;) have access to all    relevant documents.  National Union of Women Teachers.  Resolutions passed at Annual Meetings : ;      1934.   That  this Conference asserts its belief that the only means    of ensuring the peace of the world is the abolition of all nationally-owned    armaments.  It demands that the provisions in the Treaty of Versailles.    for the disarmament of this  country shall be carried out  forthwith, and    further urges that the British Government shall give a lead to the whole    world by  abolishing the manufacture of arms for private profit.      1935.   That this Conference assets its belief that only by disarmament    can future warfare  be prevented and calls upon the Government to lead    the way towards World Security by abolishing the manufacture of arms    for private profit.      1935.   That  this Conference deplores  the increasing expenditure on    armaments as being in no way a solution of the problem of peace and    security, and asserts that such increase is being made at  the expense of    the constructive services such  as education. Moreover, this Conference    would welcome a public inquiry, on the lines of the American  Inquiry,    into the question of armament-making.  National  British  Women&apos;s  Total Abstinence Union.   (Membership over120,000.)-  Resolution passed by National Executive Committee, 19th October, 1932 :       That this meeting of the National Executive Committee of the National    British Women&apos;s Total Abstinence Union. . . .strongly urges the British    Government. . . .to  announce.its-support.for.., . .

  No More War Movement.  (Membership, 3,500.)  Resolution passed by Annual Conference, October,  1934 :        This  Conference  draws the attention of the  Government  to the    scandalous  state  of affairs  disclosed  in the Washington  armaments    inquiry.   It challenges the  manufacturers of armaments to vindicate    themselves against the charges made by the Union of Democratic  Control    in  its recent publications,  and  demands that all  such  charges and    disclosures be fully investigated by a public judicial inquiry held in this    country under the conditions imposed  at Washington,  at which access    must be  given  to  all  relevant documents,   including  Government    Documents,  necessary witnesses subpoenaed,  statements made  upon    oath or affirmation, and cross-examination conducted by counsel.  National Liberal Federation.   (At  the  last Election the Liberal Vote inthis country totalled over 5  millions.)  Extract from Statement issued  by principal Officers  of  the  Federation,10th November, 1934 :-       This Statement completely ignores the perturbation  which has been    widely aroused  by the revelations made in the American Inquiry and    the widespread  conviction that these misgivings can  only be allayed by    an inquiry as searching and  as public in this country both in regard to    the methods that are being  pursued and in regard to the best  way of    dealing with this  problem.       Liberals recognise that the immediate acquisition  by the State  of all    Armament Factories is, at this moment, quite impracticable, and that    the immediate objective should be vigorous international action for the    control of the traffic in arms.  It is deplorable that the Foreign Secretary    should not  have  stated  specifically  that the support  of this country    would be vigorously given to the proposals now before the Disarmament    Conference on this subject.  The Labour Party.   (Individual membership, 366,013.  Affiliated member-ship,  1,937,417.)  Resolution adopted by Annual Conference,  1927 :        This Conference demands  that the British Government should ratify    the Convention on Traffic in  Arms and Munitions, and should take steps    with a view to  the projected  Convention on the Manufacture of Arms    being completed and  ratified  without delay.  This  Convention should    provide for publicity  in  respect of the manufacture of arms both by    States and, until they are effectively abolished, by private manufacturers.  Resolution adopted by Annual  Conference, 1933 :        This Conference calls upon the British Government at the Disarmament    Conference  to submit proposals for. . . .the suppression of all  private    manufacture and  trade in arms, and for strict international inspection    and control of the execution  of a Disarmament Treaty.

  The Trade Union Congress General Council.  Extracts from Memorandum on the question of Peace and the Preventionof War, submitted to Annual Congress, September, 1934, and from letter of9th April, 1935, signed by Walter M. Citrine, General  Secretary.    In the memorandum we declared that :       &quot; The only  way  of  establishing social  justice is  by getting  rid of    production for private profit and substituting production for the use of    the community.&quot;      &quot; We related that statement to the League Covenant, which pledges    its members to concert action  for eliminating the evil of the private    manufacture of munitions and implements of war.&quot;      &quot; Further, at the International  Congress  of Trade Unions in 1933,    at  which  the British  Trades Union  Congress  General Council  were    represented, a resolution was passed urging the complete abolition of  the    private manufacture  of  armaments  and  an effective national  and    international control for the production of and trade in arms and munitions    of war.&quot;  The League of Nations Union.   (Membership, 396,184.)  Resolutions passed at General Council, December, 1933 :       1. That  it is contrary  to the public interest  that the manufacture    and sale of armaments should be carried on for private profit,     2. That  the  General Council  recommends  that,  pending  the  total   suppression of private manufacture and trade, a vigorous national and   international control of the manufacture of and trade in arms  should be   instituted on the lines of the Traffic in Arms  Convention of  1925,  and   the amendments proposed by the French Government to the  British   Draft Disarmament Convention (29th May,  1933) &quot; for the purpose of    establishing supervised limitation of  the manufacture of  and trade in   war material.&quot;  Resolution passed by General Council, December, 1934 :      That the General Council of the League of Nations Union,     Maintaining  its  previously  expressed  opinions  concerning  evils   attendant upon the manufacture and sale of arms for private profit,     Welcomes the proposals presented to  the Bureau of the Disarmament   Conference on 20th November, 1934, by the American Government,  for   the regulation and control of the manufacture  of and trade in  arms and   the establishment of a Permanent Disarmament Commission ;     Notes with pleasure  that H.M. Government have already  expressed   their approval in principle ;  and     Urges H.M. Government to do all in their power to secure international   agreement  on these lines.

Bolton Women Citizens&apos; Association.   (Affiliated Membership, 1,100.)  Extract from Sixteenth Report,  December, 1934 : -     In March the signatures of eighteen prominent citizens were obtained   for  a  Petition  advocating the abolition  of the private manufacture of   arms,  and this was sent to the Prime Minister and Members of Parliament   for the Borough.

In addition to this evidence of public opinion, the following is a summaryof what the Women&apos;s International League believes to be relevant as to the praticability of  the adoption  by the  United Kingdom  of the private manu-facture of and trade in arms.    THE  COLLECTIVE SYSTEM AND  THE  ARMS  INDUSTRY  The Covenant of the League of Nations made great changes in international organisation.  The chief  of these are the renunciation of the unrestrictedright  of war, and  the obligation to take  common  action to preserve peace.It is incumbent upon  all States Members of the League to adapt their  lawand administration in a way which will enable them to fulfil these pledges.  Manufacture and trade in arms by private enterprise is  organised upon asystem dating  from before the War.  It is one  of those interests of  thecommunity  which were considered  purely  domestic  according to  pre-warconceptions.   They  have  now  become matters  of international  concern,But as yet no change has been  introduced into the methods and control ofthis industry.The Arms Industry and Disarmament.  The importance of this problem is  one with the  importance of armamentsin modern warfare.  All the  major  attempts at disarmament,  undertakensince  the War, have concentrated upon arms rather than upon man-power.The  very reluctance of the  armed  Powers to surrender those armamentswith which each believes itself  to be best equipped testifies to their importance.So does the fact that the efforts made at the League  since 1921 to controlmanufacture and trade in arms directly, up till the present, have been opposed by some of the great arms-producing  States.  In Scotland the following Societies co-operated in a Petition to the Houseof Commons  relating  to  the  Private Manufacture  of Armaments  and munitions, October,  1933, to April, 1934.

189  Disarmament, if any effective scheme were accepted, must mean restriction of the manufacture of and  trade in arms.  Every producing  State mustprohibit the manufacture  of any arms renounced by the Agreement.  an example of this fact may be drawn from League history.   In 1925 the LeagueStates signed  the  Protocol for  the Prohibition  of the  use  in  War  ofAsphyxiating,  Poisonous and other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of warfare,  which has since  been ratified by 38 States and  is in  force.  TheDisarmament  Conference realised the futility of forbidding the use of poisongas in war, while  permitting  its production in time of peace.  EighteenStates urged the prohibition of peace-time  preparation of  poison  gas  in1932, and in 1934 Great Britain joined this opinion.  It is clear also that if the nations  agree upon a limitation of  armaments,they  must forbid the proffer for sale  of  newly invented weapons,  for the possession of such weapons would in effect be a violation of their agreement.  The private arms industry, as it exists now, inevitably opposes disarmament and seeks to stimulate the competition in arms.  Innumerable examples  ofthis fact might be given ;  a typical instance was the statement of Mr.  Faireyto the Daily Mail :       &quot; Before we  start increasing  the  number of  our Royal Air Force    squadrons which,  of course, is  vitally  necessary the nation  must    increase its reserve of machines  by 400 per cent.   Unless that is done    our Air Force would be non-existent  at the end of two  months  should    it be engaged  in war. ...  To build  up an  adequate reserve  would    cost  about  9,000,000, which is  only about  2,000,000  more than the    cost of a capital ship like the Rodney. Unless something is  done about    this very vital matter we might just as well give up our Air  Force fine    and efficient as it is and rely On the League of Nations.&quot;  This utterance was  contemporaneous with the acceptance of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of the principles of total  abolition of civil and militar3&apos; aviation.The Arms Industry and Stimulation of War.  The attempt made by the arms firms  to  enlarge  their markets is wellexemplified by the energetic salesmanship which has converted South Americainto an armed camp since  the  Great  War.  This is  largely done by playingoff one country against another.  Thus, during a period of tension betweenPeru and Chile, the  Electric Boat Company of the United States was buildingsubmarines for Peru.  It received an  offer to build submarines for Chilealso ;  but passed the  offer  over to Vickers, Ltd., its British allied firm, with whom it shares patents and profits.  Mr. Spear, of the Electric Boat Company,wrote to Sir Charles Craven, of Vickers Limited       &quot; 2.  The country in question is Chile and the business in its present    aspect started with  a  cable from our representative there asking if we    could furnish two boats for immediate delivery  larger than 900 tons,    and  stating that  the  boats could be second-hand  provided that the    design was modern.   For reasons with which you are already familiar,    and I think that  as the cards now lie, it will be best, for the time being    at least, to continue to talk of nothing  but British construction, hence    my cable  to you of February 21st with reference to the possibility  of    making quick delivery  cf two &apos; L  &apos; boats.&quot;The instance of the arming  of Bolivia and  Paraguay, after  the League  ofNations and the United States had obtained a cessation of the 1928 hostilities,is one of arms  competition  directly induced by the private industry.   It was thus described by the League Chaco Report:       &quot; The  armies engaged are  using  up-to-date material ;   aeroplanes,    armoured  cars, flame  projectors, quick-firing guns,  machine guns and    automatic rifles ;  the automatic weapons are available in great quantities,  .  but the other arms are few.   The  arms and material of  every kind are    not manufactured locally, but are  supplied to the belligerents by American    and European countries.&quot;Daily Mail,4.1.34.BritishMemo-randum,January,1934.SenatorialArmsInquiry,Exhibit 68,3.3.27.League ofNationsDocument,C.154 M.64,1934.   VII.
  This report resulted  in  the arms  embargo, proposed by Great Britain,and imposed first  upon both belligerents, and later, when  Bolivia accepted and Paraguay  refused League settlement,  upon  Paraguay only.   But the embargo was too late to have any decisive result in stopping hostilities.   Thesituation revealed two things :  first that  the present methods of export control exercised  by Great Britain  and some other countries are totallyineffective in stopping arms purchase at its most dangerous stage, when itis leading to war ;  and secondly that the arms trade by seeking its market in regions where international trouble  is threatening is actually a contributorycause of war.  The classic cases of these facts come from the recent history of the Far East.The civil wars  in  China, at first, were relatively bloodless.  But from 1922onwards the War-Lords were supplied by the arm-firms of  Europe, Americaand Japan, with every sort of modern weapon, in defiance of the China arms embargo of 1919-1929.  As a result the civil wars became  as destructive of life as they  had always been of property, and Chinese battles had  and have very heavy  casualties.  Even  more striking  was the case  of  the  Japaneseinvasion and annexation of Manchuria and  Jehol.  The  fighting in that  war was principally clone in the air, by  the Japanese.  Their strategy was  to bomb  towns, railways, the Chinese forces, and any village  or farm through which such  forces were reported to have passed.  Japan has  no aeroplaneindustry.  The bombing planes with which  she so  successfully committedaggression in violation of the Covenant and  of the Kellogg Pact were sold toher by the private arms industry of Europe and America.Nationalisation  The commercial interest of the private  arms  industry  lies in  war.    Itopposes disarmament, stimulates  the arms race, supplies  violators of  theCovenant.   All these activities are entirely legal,  and impossible to stop  aslong as the present system  is continued.  It  is, therefore, necessary  to reform the system, which can only be done by removing from the industry the motiveof private profit.  The arms  industry should, therefore, be nationalised ifpossible by  international  agreement with other  countries.   Some  would agree  at once.  All purely  importing countries are already nationalised sincethe government is the only legal purchaser of munitions of  war. Russia has only national production  of arms.   Denmark, France,  Poland and Spainproposed general nationalisation in 1933. An important group of states aretherefore already prepared to adopt  this measure.  It is not one,  however,which should wait  for universal acceptance, for once it is realised that privatearms  industry  is incompatible with  the Covenant  it becomes the duty  ofHis Majesty&apos;s  Government to abolish it whether other League States doso or  not.International Control  In  the  meantime negotiations  for  national  control  and publicity,  and international supervision and inspection of the arms industry have been conducted at Geneva on the basis of  the United States Draft  Proposals ofNovember, 1934.  The general debate  on this draft showed that every Statesave two represented at the Committee accepted it.  Some, like France and russia,- desired to strengthen it.  Britain, supported by Italy only, sought to weaken it  by  reducing  the provisions  for publicity  to  &quot; total value  bycategories &quot;  and by refusing international inspection in the manufacturing and selling countries.  Had it not been for this British opposition, there is nodoubt that the American draft would have been accepted,  and the necessaryfactor of international supervision and inspection established.  We venture to suggest to the Royal Commission that the measure of publicity and controlproposed by the American Government  is the minimum needed as a framework for a reformed system. ,which may  fulfil the requirements of the Covenant.
181CovenantArticle VIIlJLeagueDocumentA.16.1924.IX.LeagueDocumentConf.D/C.G.48.  3.3.33.Abuses in the Present System  A number of experts have always held that the &quot; evil effects &quot; attendantupon private manufacture of arms  can only be eliminated by suppression.As  the signatories of the Minority Report  of the  Sub-Committee of theTemporary Mixed Commission said in 1924 :        &quot; They wish first of all to state that in their opinion the best way to     prevent the evil effects which the Covenant recognises as being attendant     upon the private manufacture of arms would be absolute prohibition.&quot;  The Women&apos;s  International League  agrees with this view.  It considersthat the disadvantages of the  arms industry are inherent in its ordinary commercial character.  This  was well  expressed  by  the  Danish, French,Polish and Spanish Delegations in their memorandum to the DisarmamentConference :       &quot; Everywhere the private manufacture of arms and  ammunition, like     all  other private economic activities,  aims primarily at a profitable     return upon  the invested capital.  There must, therefore,  be a constant     increase in the demand for arms, which can  only be maintained in an     atmosphere of strained international relations.&quot;  Apart  from this intrinsic opposition between  the interest of the  armsindustry and the  interest of the community of nations there are  of course a number of &quot; abuses &quot; even against the present system.  Thus the arms tradeinfluences the press in some countries, notably in France, where members ofthe  Comite des  Forges are majority  shareholders  in the &quot; Temps,&quot; the&quot; Journal des Debats &quot; and other papers.  In the Senate Inquiry of 1929 theDirector of the three largest ship-building firms in the  United States admitted that they had paid Mr. Shearer to act as &quot; observer &quot; at President Coolidge&apos;sThree Power Naval Conference in Geneva in 1927.   Corruption  is a trademethod in  every country  where officials  are open to bribery.   This isexemplified by the Swedish Government Report of 1931,  under which  fourofficers were dismissed as unsuited to their posts ; by the Skoda Scandal in roumania from 1933-35 by numbers  of the exhibits laid before the SenatorialArms Inquiry,  and which were acknowledged by their writers, directors ofarms firms, as authentic documents.  &quot; Influence,&quot; corruption, secrecy andintrigue are indeed characteristics of the industry in  general.   The fact  that national armament, contrary to the Covenant, is carried on in secret, is largelyresponsible for the sinister nature of the trade.   National and internationalpublicity is needed to cure it.  But the main reason is that a private industryis engaged in selling the weapons of war to governments.  There is no remedy for this but nationalisation.  The same is  true of  &quot; gun-running &quot;  in the  ordinary sense of the term.There are people  who sell arms to terrorists  and to rebels.  There are firms which sell  arms  to  countries forbidden to have  them.  For instance, theSenatorial  Inquiry revealed that United Aircraft  Export Inc.  made thefollowing sales to  Germany (aeroplane engines) :       1932   ..............      $6,000      1933   ..............    $272,000      1934 (first eight months)    ........$1,445,000The  St. Gotthard case of 1928 and the Hirtenbirg case of 1933, raised at the  1928. 1933.League of Nations, were examples of the same kind.  The smuggling of arms is inevitable so long as the industry remains in private hands. Like other abuses in the present system it can only be prevented by prohibition of the private industry.The  British System  The British system of export licence  is on the right lines as fitting into asystem of  international publicity and  control.  It  is, however, defective.Detailed figures of export licences are not regularly and promptly published.Manufacture  for  the home Government and  manufacture in State works areSwedishGovernment report,1931.Debates intheRoumanianChamber,23.3.33.27.3.35.SenatorialArmsInquiry,Part 6,pp. 1496-8.
not published at all.   An international system .of publicity, is unattainableuntil all manufacture,  both state and private, and all export are subject toprompt and detailed publication.  The most glaring omission from the British system is the exemption of aircraft from export business.   Aeroplanes, whether civil or military, shouldbe subject to manufacture  and  export licence.  All  aeroplanes made andsold  should be  included with  all other arms in the international  systemproposed by the American Draft Convention.  The policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, as contained in the Disarmament Conference Memorandum ofJanuary, 1934, envisages abolition of military aviation and control  of :civilaviation.  It is obvious that control of civil aviation  cannot be establishedwithout regular and detailed publicity in the manufacture and ownership ofall aeroplanes.

Wales and Cardiganshire, and summarised     in the appended Document, was presented to the Prime Minister, Foreign     Minister and local M.Ps. on 11th April.  The  most cursory glance at     this  Document must convince the  reader of the  wide support it received     in the area dealt with. 1935       The N. Wales  Council has followed closely the discussions on Traffic     in Arms at Geneva, and at its annual meeting in Bangor on 15th February,     1935,  it  was agreed  that          &quot; If Private Profit from the  Manufacture  of and Trade in Arms       cannot be  done away with, there  must  be  international  inspection       on the spot in all countries.&quot;   In presenting this evidence of the serious consideration given to these matters in our seven counties, the North Wales Women&apos;s Peace Council would desireto emphasise its impression of the importance of International Inspection of armament Factories on the Spot.  While  gravely disappointed that  the British  representative  has not taken this line at Geneva, we realise that the  British Government is not irrevocablycommitted on the question of Inspection, and urge that  Great Britain shallput  her  whole weight even now on  the side  of obtaining a disarmament convention  which  shall  include  International  Inspection of   ArmamentFactories and of the Trade in Arms.

The British; Council of the World Alliance  for Inter-national Friendship  through the Churches,   Believing that the  private  trade in arms as at presentcarried on, exercises a sinister influence  upon efforts fordisarmament and is a direct menace to peace and to thatspirit  of friendship  and goodwill amongst the  nations which it is the duty of Christian people to-promote.

The  restriction by . adequate  national control     of private profits in:the arms industry, the pursuit of     which is at present open to grave obj ection and abuse.       2.

Woodward&apos;s Great Britainand the German Navy (Oxford Clarendon Press).     ALLEGED MALPRACTICES BY BRITISH ARMAMENT  FIRMS                     IN THE  PRE-WAR PERIOD  As stated in the introductory paragraph to our report, two pre-War incidentsonly, as affecting British firms,  have been cited to us  in  support of  the numerous allegations that have  been made that armament firms have been guilty of indulging in malpractices of one type or another.  One has referenceto the allegation that,  by means of propaganda  and the dissemination offalse reports,  influence is brought to bear on governments by armament firms in  their endeavours to stimulate orders the Mulliner  incident.   Theother has reference to the charge that armament firms indulge in bribery intheir endeavours to secure orders the Japanese naval scandal of 1914.                         The Mulliner  Incident  In May, 1906, Mr. Mulliner, the  then  managing director of the CoventryOrdnance Works wrote to the War Office a letter which was passed on tothe Admiralty,  in which he drew attention to developments which were takingplace at Krupp&apos;s works in Germany, such as would enable them to acceleratetheir rate of production  of large naval guns and gun mountings. Mr. Mullinersupplemented his  information to the Admiralty  from time to time untilJune, 1908.  According to the evidence furnished to us on behalf of the Admiralty itwas known at  that time that Mr.  Mulliner was anxious to  secure for  theCoventry Ordnance Works  orders for large gun mountings  ;  nevertheless,it was considered desirable  to  verify Mr.  Mulliner&apos;s information from anindependent source, and this the Naval  Attache at Berlin was accordinglyinstructed to do.  The information given by Mr. Mulliner was very largely confirmed by theNaval Attache.  Further,  during the winter  of  1908-9, information wasreceived  from  an independent  source  which  indicated  that the  german naval programme was likely to be accelerated  beyond the published figures and, in the light of this information, Mr. Mulliner&apos;s statements were regardedas  having an  increased significance.  Accordingly,  early in  1909, he wasinterviewed by the  then Secretary  of the  Committee  of Imperial  Defencewho told him  that his  information corroborated evidence already obtained by them, and in March of that year he was invited  to be present at a meeting with ministers at which he expounded his views.  In the following December,  Mr. Mulliner differences  of  opinion havingarisen between  himself and the Admiralty published in the press a lettercontaining an  account of  his  interview with  ministers,  and subsequentlycommunicated  to the press a chronological account  of his activities whichwas published and became known as Mr. Mulliner&apos;s diary.  For a more  detailed account of Mr. Mulliner&apos;s activities  and the action taken by the government in regard to -the information  furnished  by him,reference is invited to the published Minutes of Evidence given before  theRoyal Commission  on the 21st of May,  1936  (Qs. 4963 et seq.), and also to annex 6 to the Memorandum appended to those Minutes.*  The Royal Commission are not concerned with the precise reason whichprompted Mr.  Mulliner to act as he did  ;  he doubtless was  disappointed atthe time at his inability to secure from the Admiralty additional orders whichhe had reason  to hope  might have been placed with  his firm.  There is nodoubt at all that he was very active in the propaganda on the naval  questionduring the year 1909,  especially  in  the opposition press,  and  that  the
resulting agitation contributed to  the general state  of tension  between.Germany and Great Britain on the subject.  The Commission^ interest inthe episode is to determine so far as possible whether it affords evidence ofan  attempt by  an armament firm to stimulate armament orders by the dissemination of false reports, and from this aspect we examine the episode-in the following paragraphs.  It was obviously Mr. Mulliner&apos;s duty, whether as an agent of his firm or as a private citizen, to give the Admiralty any information of value knownto himself of which he supposed them to be ignorant, and it was the duty ofthe Admiralty to investigate and form its own judgment on such information.It is beyond  the scope of this inquiry to determine whether Mr. Mulliner&apos;estimates of German capacity to build were correct or otherwise,  but it hasbeen strongly denied in evidence that the Admiralty were dependent on mr.  Mulliner for their information  or  that in  laying their estimates theyrelied on his forecast of the capacity of the Germans to build or to acceleratebuilding.  We are assured that all the information he supplied was checkedby the  British Naval Attaches and other officials who supplied independentreports.  In the event the current German programmes appear not to have beenaccelerated, but the Admiralty felt bound to act on the assumption thatthey might be, since it would be impossible or  very difficult to correct ahunder-estimate  of  the German output,  whereas  an  over-estimate would bea mistake on the safe side which could be  adjusted in future programmes.Whether they were right or wrong in so acting, Mr. Mulliner appears to havehad no influence on  their decision,  except as  one contributor among manyto their sources of information.  It may be added from knowledge  since available* that the preparations forguns and  gun-mountings and  other indications noticed  in  1908 and 1909of an intention to accelerate or increase construction were probably connectedwith the new programme  which in spite of denials  given to the BritishGovernment,  the Germans had even then in contemplation.  At a conferenceon  the  Naval question held in Berlin in June, 1909, Count Metternich, theGerman Ambassador in &quot;London, complained that he had been placed in a false position  by his denial under instructions that any such programme hadbeen thought of, and said that he  had been unpleasantly surprised to find that it  was going forward.   This was no doubt the programme disclosed toLord Haldane by  the  German Government itself on his visit to Berlin inJanuary, 1912, and it was judged by the British Admiralty to be so much inexcess of what they had expected and for which they had made provision asto require the additional large programme of capital ships adopted by thegovernment at the beginning of 1914.  The margin of superiority thought necessary for the British Fleet over theGerman Fleet, was laid down at 60 per cent, early in the present century,i.e., soon after Germany had made known her intention of building a  greatfleet, and it was accepted by successive governments.   The maintenance ofthis superiority depended on rightly estimating not only the number of newbattleships  proposed by the Germans which  could be  ascertained  fromtheir Navy Laws but the possibility of construction being accelerated and preparations for new programmes being carried to an advanced stage before these programmes were announced.  These were difficult matters which at times gave rise to sharp controversy, but  when war broke out the marginpossessed by  the British fleet  was  little, if at  all, above the 60 per  cent.originally proposed, and it is not the general opinion that it proved excessive.  * See  German Documents (Grosse Politik), XXVIII,  pp. 168-78;  alsoletters from Sir Edward Grey putting on  record the German assurance tothis effect.   Ibid.,  p.  130.  For the  Haldane  Mission see British documents on the origins of the  War (Gooch and Temperley), Vol. VI, Chap.  49, andHaldane&apos;s Before the War.
                  The Japanese Naval Scandal of 1914   In the autumn of 1914, two Japanese Admirals were tried by a Naval Court-martial in Japan and convicted of offences in connection with the contract for the building by Vickers of&apos; the  kong,  an  armoured cruiser  for the:Japanese Government.  The contract was signed, in November, 1910, at which time the  Mitsui Bussan Company of Japan were acting as sole  agents in japan for Vickers, on a commission basis.   The charge against Admiral Matsumoto was that, when acting as Director ofNaval Stores Department,  he agreed to accept, and did accept, a substantial&apos;share of the Mitsui Bussan Company&apos;s commission as a condition of placing the contract for the construction of the cruiser with Vickers.   The charge  against  Admiral Fujii was of receiving  commissions  fromBritish firms, including Vickers, and  in their case in connection with the contract for the cruiser. In both cases considerable sums of money were paid.In the case of Admiral Matsumoto the money was  paid by the Mitsui BussanCompany ;  and in the case of Admiral Fujii by Vickers.   The manager of Vickers&apos; yard at Barrow at the time when the contractwas negotiated, and the  vessel built, is dead.   No  entry appears in theCompany&apos;s Minutes  of any arrangement  with Admiral  Fujii.  The onlysurviving directors know nothing of any such arrangement, or of any paymentbeing made to the Admiral; and there is no one  now connected with, or inthe employ of the Company who can throw any light upon the matter, except:that on  investigation of their books  it appears  that the  sums which the admiral admitted at his trial that he had received are debited  to the cost ofthe vessel. With a view, however, of giving the Commission all the information in their power, Vickers procured from the British  Museum extracts from the&apos;Japanese  Chronicle containing reports  of the trial of the  two Admirals andsupplied them to the Commission.   As appears  from these  abstracts thefollowing  are the reasons given for their judgment by the Court in the caseof Admiral Fujii.       In  March, 1910, the accused was appointed  to visit England as  an     officer for the supervision of the construction  of warships, with an order     to report on the estimates and specifications sent by Armstrongs and     Vickers, of a  battle-cruiser,  which the  Navy  Department  proposed     to build.       Accused arrived in  London  on 11th  June, of  same  year, examined     the estimates and specifications  submitted by the two firms in question.     on 30th July,  and reported on the result  of his examination to the Naval     Stores Department on  9th August, adding that the Vickers&apos; specification,     was the more precise  and the price was lower.  On returning to Tokyo     in September of the  same year,  he further  reported verbally to the     authorities the result of his examination.      The Navy Department sought the views of Commander Kato, who     was remaining in London as a  shipbuilding inspector, on the estimate     and specification, and further  examined  them,  referring  them to the     reports of  accused and Commander  Kato.  He found the  estimate and     specification of the Vickers Company to be the better-.      It  was  decided on  5th October  of  the  same  year to order  the    construction of  the ship from Vickers,  and  the contract: was signed     between the Japanese Government and Vickers on 17th November at    the cost of ^2,307,100.      When the two English firms had been asked to supply estimates and     specifications of  the battle-cruiser,  competition ensued between them for    getting the order.      The director of the Barrow Yard of Messrs. Vickers,  who was on.    intimate terms  with   the  accused, asked him to show  his  goodwill    towards Vickers in obtaining the contract, as he  was visiting England.    as a shipbuilding inspector.   The director of the Barrow Yard thought:
    the success of Vickers  in  the competition to  be chiefly due to the    superior specification and the lower price, but partly to the good services    of the accused.      After accused&apos;s return to  Japan, the director of the Barrow Yard, with    a view to reciprocating his goodwill, remitted by draft  Yen 48,449-61    on 21st  December,  1910,  and a  further  sum of  Yen 48,449-61  in    January,  1911,  Yen  48,730-90  in  April,  Yen 48,449-61  in  July,    Yen  49,449-61  in  September,  and Yen  46,335-90  in  June,   1912.    The accused appreciated the purpose of the senders and accepted the    remittance.      Accused was appointed director of the Fourth Section of  the  Stores    Department, in  December, 1910, and  while  he was  working in that    capacity  the Navy Department ordered the Stores Department  to see    to the  manufacture of the turbines for the battle-cruiser Hiyei which    was to be built at the Yokosuka Naval Yard.      The  accused consulted the  Mitsubishi Yard on the matter  but this    yard  declined to accept the order on the &quot;ground of inexperience in the    manufacture of turbines.      After consulting Admiral  Matsumoto Wa, then Director of the  Stores    Department, the accused decided to order the  turbines  from  Vickers.      Matsumoto  endorsed  the decision, and on 25th March,  1911, the    shipbuilding inspector in England signed a contract with Vickers for    the supply of the turbines at a cost of ^132,000.      The director of Vickers attributed the order given to his firm to the    influence  of the accused and, with a view to acknowledging the favour,    sent a  remittance of  Yen  9,971 on 26th December,  1911, which the    accused accepted ....  In the case of Admiral Matsumoto it appears from the  extracts that inMay or June,  1910, the Mitsui Bussan agents for Vickers and  Takata Shokaiagents for Armstrongs becoming aware of the  proposed order for a warshipcommenced calling on the Admiral who was Director of the Naval StoresDepartment to solicit the order.  There was keen  competition between thetwo firms.   The agents for the  Mitsui Bussan Company ultimately offered the Admiral one-third of the Company&apos;s commission if he placed the orderwith Vickers.  The order was placed with Vickers and the bribe was paid.(C227S6)  12 6  60  10/36
