Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  August 1936.SECRET.125&amp;-B.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 509.)COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.WESTERN  MEDITERRANEAN:  SITUATION ARISING  FROM   THE                        SPANISH  CIVIL  WAR.                Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.    IN accordance with the request contained in the letter from the ForeignOffice which is attached as Annex I to this Report, we have had under consideration-tion the extent to which British interests would be affected and what action HisMajesty&apos;s Government might take in the event of Italy taking some action whichmight upset the existing balance in the Western Mediterranean.British interests in the Western Mediterranean.    2.  The chief British  interest  in the Western Mediterranean is the safety of our trade and  of  our sea and air  communications which pass through  theStraits of  Gibraltar  and close along  the  southern  shore  of Spain.   For  thepurpose of maintaining the required degree of  security in this  area, as well as for the protection of our sea communications with South America and the Cape,it is essential that Gibraltar should continue to be available to us as a secure naval base.  In addition, it is hoped to establish in the comparatively near  futurean air base at Gibraltar which will be a key station in the  &quot; all  red &quot; air routesfrom  United Kingdom both to  the  Far East and to the Cape.  Even if the air route  through the Mediterranean were  to be closed  to us  through the loss  or destruction of  air  facilities at Malta,  the  Gibraltar air  base  would still  be essential for the use of the alternative air  route via the west coast of Africa.    3.  For 150 miles east of  Gibraltar both shores of the Mediterranean  areSpanish, and are no more than one hundred miles apart at any point.  In a warwith  a European Power it would,  therefore, be essential to our interests thatSpain should be friendly, or at worst, strictly neutral.  A hostile Spain  or  theoccupation of Spanish territory by a hostile Power would make our control of theStraits and use  of  Gibraltar as a naval and air base  extremely  difficult,  if  not impossible, and  would  thus imperil Imperial communications  by way of  theMediterranean.    Similarly, apart  from the situation in the Western Mediterranean  itself,the possession by a hostile Power of harbours on the Atlantic seaboard in Spanishterritory would imperil our communications by way of the Atlantic.    4.  Our position at Gibraltar has for many years been based on a continuation of friendly relations with Spain.   Apart from the risk of any foreign interven-tion, should a Government inimical to  Britain,  whether Fascist  or Communist,emerge from the present struggle,  the  question of the security  of our base  at gibraltar will require serious examination.

    5.  Our interests in the present Spanish crisis may therefore be summarisedas       &apos;              &apos;fV/&apos;-\. 4  &apos;   .  -        &apos;  &apos;             .  -&apos;-r^. -: &apos;;V^  ---&apos;&apos;    (a) the maintenance of the Territorial integrity of Spain and her possessions           (Balearies,  Morocco, Canaries and Rio de Oro);    (5) the maintenance of such relations with any Spanish Government that           may emerge from this conflict as will ensure benevolent neutrality in           the event of our being engaged in any European war.Italy and the  Morocco Treaty position.    6.  The Treaty position  as regards fortifications and cession  of  territory in Morocco, so far as  we have been able to assess it is explained in Annex II.The effect of existing conventions seems to be briefly as follows :    (1) France, Spain and ourselves  are all bound to prevent the erection of           fortifications,  &amp;c,  on the Spanish-Moroccan  coast bordering  on the           Mediterranean with the exception of certain ports and islands which           are under full Spanish sovereignty.    (2) With the  same exceptions, Spain is under an obligation not to  cede any           of her  rights in her sphere of influence in Morocco to another Power.                   POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION BY ITALY.    7.  It is clear that Italy is the Power that has most to gain by upsettingthe existing balance in the Western Mediterranean since her present  strategic position in the Mediterranean is obviously unfavourable.   Both exits  are inforeign hands, and her seaborne trade with countries outside the Mediterraneanis therefore at the mercy of any  Power that can control the Straits of gibraltar and the Suez Canal.  Consequently, it is not impossible that Italy may try to takeadvantage  of the present crisis in  Spain to  improve her  position  in theMediterranean.    8.  The steps which Italy might take with the above object in view may besummarised  as follows :       (i) She might openly intervene in support of the insurgents;     (ii) She might create some  pretext, such as the protection of her nationals           or the infringement of her maritime rights, to occupy Spanish  territory           in a less conspicuous way;    (iii)  Signor Mussolini might obtain from General Franco the promise of the           lease, or cession, of some Spanish territory in exchange for his effective           intervention in the present  struggle.   Territories which might be so           bartered are                part of Spain itself, one or more of the Balearic Islands, part of                   Spanish Morocco, the Canary Islands, and Rio de Oro;    (iv) In addition, or alternatively to (iii) above, Signor Mussolini might come           to an  understanding with General Franco  that, in  exchange for           effective Italian intervention, the latter would conclude an offensive-           defensive Italo-Spanish  alliance when he came into power.The above measures, and particularly the effect which they would have on Britishinterests, are discussed seriatim in the paragraphs that follow.    9.   With  regard  to Paragraph 8  ii) above,  open Italian intervention insupport of the insurgents would precipitate  a major international crisis.  Itwould be beyond  the scope of this Paper  to attempt to  consider in detail thesituation that would arise.    10.   The  possibilities  summarised in paragraph 8  (ii) and  (iii) will beconsidered together, since the material effect of an Italian occupation of  any ofthe territories in question, however that occupation is brought about, is much thesame.    11.   The Occupation  by Italy of  any land in the  Spanish Peninsula would obviously  prejudice the security of  our position  at Gibraltar  and of  our communications.   But the Spaniards are a people intensely proud of their ownrace  and country, and we, therefore, consider it  reasonable  to rule  out the
 possibility of any permanent Italian occupation of Spain itself.  It is true that Catalonia might split away, but  we do hot think  even this province  could  be dominated by foreigners for long.     12.  The Italian occupation of any part of Spanish Morocco, and particularly of  Ceuta,  which is  fifteen  miles  from  Gibraltar, would  bring&quot; Gibraltar within range of heavy Italian air attack, and thus deny to us its full use as a Naval Base.   In addition,  the possession and possible development by Italy of any  of the Spanish Moroccan ports, small  and undeveloped though they are at the present time, would contribute to our difficulties in controlling the  Straits of Gibraltar. Accordingly, we regard the maintenance of the territorial  integrity of Spanish Morocco as of vital importance to  British interests.   France also has an interest in this possibility, since an Italian occupation of the territory in question would menace the communications between  her Mediterranean and Atlantic seaboards.     13.   An Italian occupation of any of the  Balearic Islands would  probably not be acceptable to the islanders themselves, but the possibilities&apos; of  their having to submit to force majeure cannot be  ruled out.     The naval facilities in these islands are at present as follows :--     Majorca, 450 miles from Gibraltar, has no harbour entirely suitable for a naval base, since Palma and Pollenza Bay, although  good in some ways, are too exposed.  Minorca, which is still further from Gibraltar, has in  Port Mahon a small, but heavily defended, naval base.     As regards air facilities, there are, so far as is known, no military air stations in the Balearic Islands at the present time; but there is no doubt that they could be  established without great difficulty.   It is understood that  there is  a satis- factory aerodrome site at Pollenza, and that civil seaplane services were operated at Port Mahon and Palma in 1932.     In view of the foregoing an Italian occupation of any of the  Balearic Islands would not vitally affect British strategical interests.   At the same time it would give Italy a base for naval and air operations,  250 miles nearer Gibraltar than anything which  she possesses at the present time.  The menace to our control of the Straits and to Gibraltar itself would thus be increased.     14.  It is to be noted in addition that an Italian occupation of any of the Balearic Islands  would constitute a direct  threat  to French  communications between France  and her  possessions in  Northern Africa;  it  is,  therefore, reasonable to assume  that an enterprise of this kind  would be most energetically opposed by France.     15.  An Italian occupation of the Canary Islands and/or Rio cle Oro would present her with a base flanking our  communications  to the  Cape  of Good Hope and South America.   Since, in  a war with Italy,  the bulk of our eastern trade might have  to use the Cape route, it is clear that an Italian  occupation of either the Canary Islands or Rio de Oro would be prejudicial to our interests. An italo-Spanish Alliance.     16.  It remains  to consider the possibility  indicated in paragraph 8 (iv), namely, the conclusion of  an Italo-Spanish alliance.   The effect of this would be that Spanish ports and aerodromes would be available for the use of Italian forces in time of war.   This  would constitute a most serious menace  not  only to our use of  Gibraltar  as a naval and air base, and to our control of  the  Straits, but also to our Imperial communications.     From the French point of view an Italo-Spanish alliance is equally undesir- able, though obviously for different reasons.     17.  It will be seen from the foregoing that the adoption by Italy of any of the courses  of action which have  been discussed  in  the preceding  paragraphs would in effect be a threat, to a greater or  lesser  degree, to  British  and French interests. .....  We now turn to the question of what action His Majesty&apos;s Government might take to safeguard the situation.               ACTION OPEN TO HIS MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.     18.   The successful issue of the Abyssinian campaign in the. face of  Leagueopposition, suggests that Mussolini, if determined to exploit the Spanish crisis to. his own advantage, will not be deterred by threats, and only, by the cer.iai.nty:      [13696]                                                     B 2
*..that force, and adequate force, will be employed against him.  We are, therefore,  driven to the conclusion that any action, other than action; in the diplomatic  sphere, which His  Majesty&apos;s Government might take which would: effectively  thwart his designs, must inevitably: involve a serious risk of war between Great  Britain and Italy.              il  -   ,                               ,      19.  The relative preparedness for  war of these/ two countries. has been  examined so exhaustively during the past twelve months that it is unnecessary  in this paper  to reconsider the question in  any  detail.  Suffice  it  to say  that Italy is the only Power whose forces are fully mobilised arid available for  immediate operations.      20.  We now turn to the consideration of what action,  other than the threat  of direct military action, might be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to prevent  Italy from embarking upon any of the enterprises visualised at  the beginning of  this Report.  Before  setting out our views on this point we venture to suggest,  with the memories of last year&apos;s events still fresh in our minds, that we should  avoid at all costs the possibility of becoming involved in  action which, on the  one hand, fails to achieve  our object,  and, on the other hand,  tends further to  alienate Italy, i.e., we should take no action which we are  not prepared to back  up by  all the force at  our command.  This  statement is  made on the under-  standing that Italy is the only enemy in contemplation.      21.  With  that general proviso, the courses of action that appear  advisable  are  summarised as  follows :       In the first place, we should press for the conclusion and rigid enforcement  of a universal agreement of non-interference in Spain by all European Powers.  If such an agreement can be  reached and enforced, there would  be no reason for  the  winning side  in Spain  to grant territorial concessions to, or negotiate closer  military relations with,  her neighbours than now exist.      22.  If no  general agreement of non-intervention can be reached, we should  not  cease  to impress on  Prance, whose strategic interests  are largely identical  with our  own,  the desirability of giving no cause  for  intervention  by Italy.  Support by France and Russia to the  forces  of  the Spanish Left may  well lead  Italy to afford open support to General Franco.      23.  We should  endeavour  to ensure that any action  taken by  Foreign  Powers, either to protect their nationals in Spanish territory or exact reparations,  is international and concerted.      Failing such agreement, every endeavour should be made locally for concerted  action to be taken when occasion arises.      This applies with particular force to action by Italian ships; and we should,  therefore,  arrange that  wherever an Italian  man-of-war is berthed in Spanish  waters there is also a British ship, and  that at important ports the British Senior  Naval Officer is, if possible, senior to the Italian.      24.   Since this report was put in hand, we  have  seen a copy of the Foreign  Office memorandum that has  recently been circulated to the Cabinet Committee  on Foreign Policy (Paper No. F.P. (36) 10).  It is suggested  in this Paper that it  should  be made publicly plain that &quot; any alteration of  the status quo in the  Western Mediterranean must be a matter  of the  closest concern to His Majesty&apos;s  Government.&quot;   We agree  that Signor  Mussolini   should be  under  no  mis-  apprehension as to  the possible  consequences  of  any action  that he may take to  disturb the existing balance in the Western Mediterranean; and we, therefore,  desire to endorse the Foreign Office suggestion.                          SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.      25. (i) Our interests in the present Spanish crisis are the maintenance     .  (a) of the territorial integrity of Spain and her possessions, and      (6) of such relations with any Spanish Government which may emerge from            this  conflict as will ensure  benevolent neutrality in the  event of our            being engaged in a European  war;      (ii) Open intervention by Italy in support of the  insurgents in  Spain would  precipitate a major international crisis;
  --&quot; (in) The occupation by Italy  of any  territory in Spain: itself would be detrimental to&apos; British interests; -      ;             . ^     -                 .     (iv) -The Italian occupation of any part of.

RECOMMENDATIONS.                        &quot;     26.  Our recommendations  may be summarised as follows :-      (i) The principle  that should govern  any action on  the   part  of  His          Majesty&apos;s Government should be that it  is most important  to  avoid          any measures which, while failing to achieve our object, merely tend          further to alienate Italy;      (ii) We should press  for  the  earliest  possible  conclusion of a non-inter-          ference pact in Spain, embracing France, Russia, Portugal, Germany,          Italy and the United Kingdom;     (iii) If  no  general  agreement  can  be reached,  we should impress on  the          French the desirability of giving no cause for  intervention by Italy;     (iv) We  should   maintain  sufficient  naval   forces   on   the  Western          Mediterranean and Spanish Atlantic  coasts  to ensure  that  we have          at least one ship at every port  where the  Italians have  one, and that          at important ports the British S.N.O. is, if possible,  senior to  the          Italian;      (v) We should, if possible, get  an agreement with the other Powers that any          landing or other  action by armed forces to preserve order should be          not only international in  character, but also, wherever this is possible,          preconcerted between the Powers affected;     (vi) Failing such agreement, every endeavour should be made  locally  for          concerted action to be taken when occasion arises;     (vii) We should make it known to Signor Mussolini  that, in  the words of          F.P. .(36)  10, &quot; any  alteration of the status&apos; quo  in   the Western          Mediterranean must be a matter of the closest concern to His Majesty&apos;s          Government &quot; in  order that he may be under no  misapprehension as          to the consequences. of any action  that he may take to disturb  the          existing balance.

ANNEX I. W. 8332/G.                                       Foreign Office, Dear Colonel Ism ay,                                     August 12, 1936.     LORD HALIFAX has asked me to write  to you to ask that the  Chiefs of  Staff should begin  considering to what extent  British interests  would be affected, and what action they advise that His Majesty&apos;s Government  should take in what is, of course,  still regarded as the unlikely event of Italy  taking some action which might upset the existing balance in the Western Mediterranean.     We do not wish to  give the impression that the Foreign Office have any real fears on this point at the present time, but it seems important that we  should be  prepared to consider what should be the reaction and  the  reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government to any such step as the landing of  Italian troops in Spanish territory,  or  the creation by Italy of some pretext to occupy  territory  in a less conspicuous way, or the grant by General Franco of the lease of some island to Italy.  We should be grateful  if you would kindly take the  appropriate stepsto have these possibilities examined.                                     Yours sincerely,                                (Signed)      ALEXANDER CADOGAN.Colonel H. L. Ismay, C.B., D.S.O.,        Committee of Imperial Defence.ANNEX II.                     ITALY AND MOROCCO TREATY POSITION.     So far as can be gathered  from a cursory examination of the treaties, the position as regards fortifications in Morocco is as follows :       By Article 7  of the Declaration of the 8th April, 1904, between the United Kingdom and France, both Governments are bound  not to permit the  erection of any fortifications or strategic works on that portion  of  the coast of Morocco comprised between, but  not including Melilla and the heights which command the right bank of the River Sebor.  This condition does not apply to the places which were in the occupation of Spain on the Moorish Coast of the Mediterranean, i.e.,  Ceuta, Melilla and probably also the following islands :               Penon de Velez;             Alhucemas; and             Zafrin.     Under Article 3 of  the secret portion of the  Declaration of the 8th April, 1904, the two Governments also agreed that on  Spain acquiring  a sphere of influence in Morocco she would have to undertake not to alienate  any  part of that sphere.     Both of these stipulations were reproduced in the Franco-Spanish Convention respecting  Morocco, signed on the 3rd October,  1904, under Article 1 of which Spain adhered to the Anglo-French Declaration of the preceding April.  Under Article 7 of this Convention, Spain undertook not to alienate or to cede in any form,  even temporarily,  the whole or any  part of her  sphere of  influence in Morocco.     The relations between Spain and France in Morocco were  again regulated in 1912 by the Convention dated the 27th November of that year  (it does notappear, however, that the Convention of the 3rd October, 1904,  was abrogated).Under Article 5 of this new  Convention,  Spain again  engaged herself not toalienate, even  temporarily, her rights in any part of the territory composing herzone of influence; and under Article 6 both Governments undertook not to permitfortifications or strategic works  on the coast of Morocco above mentioned.
    So far as can be traced, Italy is under no obligation not to fortify any partof the coast of Morocco except at Tangier, the statute of which she acceded toin 1928.    The position in brief, therefore, seems to be as follows :     (1) France,  Spain,  and  ourselves  are  all bound to  prevent the erection  of           fortifications, &amp;c, on the Spanish-Moroccan  coast bordering on  the           Mediterranean, with the exception of certain ports and islands above           mentioned which  are under full Spanish sovereignty. .    (2) With the same exceptions, Spain is under an obligation&apos;not to cede any           of her rights in her sphere of influence in Morocco to another Power.
