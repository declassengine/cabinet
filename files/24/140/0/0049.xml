Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1922.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 4349.CABINET.iRELATIVE RANK OF OFFICERS IN THE NAVY, ARMY ANDAIR FORCE.memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1 WITH reference to the draft report of the Committee under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the subject of the l-elative rank of officers in the Navy, Army and Air Force, and the Chancellors memorandum OP. 4293, in which he submits that the recommendations made in the draft report, although not accepted by the War Office and Air Ministry representatives on the Committee, i     should be approved, I desire to associate myself generally with the remarks I    submitted by the Secretary of State for War in his memorandum CP. 4312. I 2. The Air Council desire to call attention to paragraph 4 of my predecessorsj memorandum %E^44f^ where it was pointed out that the introduction of the J new7 Air Force titles did not affect the vested right of Royal Air Force officers to J the relative rank of the corresponding military titles which they had previously I     enjoyed.I 3. As  regards  the  relative  rank  assigned  in  the draft  report to  Sub-Lieutenants, R.N., maintaining their position on a level with Lieutenants in the Army and Flying or Observer Officers in the Air Force, the Air Council wish to point out that the Sub-Lieutenant, R.N., is a young officer learning his pro-fession and who never exceeds the age of 23 at the utmost.   His position and responsibility are very similar to those of a Second Lieutenant in the Army or a I    Pilot Officer in the Royal Air Force, and the Air Council consider that his relative j    rank should correspond to those ranks accordingly.   It should be remembered that j     the period of service as Sub-Lieutenant is invariably of short duration, whereas I    the period of service of a Lieutenant in the Army and a Flying Officer in the Air I    Force will always be of much greater duration, and the Air Force will always have I    officers in this rank approaching the age of 30.   It appears to the Air Council undesirable that a young Naval Lieutenant should take precedence both in service I    matters and in social life over Lieutenants in the Army and Flying Officers in the i    Air Force, who are considerably his seniors in years, who have passed through i I    almost exactly the same course of training, and who have had longer service and i j    wider experience.4. It may be pointed out that the Admiralty, in selecting a specialist branch of Naval Officers for observing duties in aircraft have selected officers of the rank j I    of Lieutenant.   As the pilot who will control the aircraft is almost always of th-e j I    rank of Flying Officer, the anomalous position will arise under the present ^ble, I which as regards the junior ranks the draft report proposes to maintain, that the officer commanding and controlling the aircraft will almost invariablj/ be junior to i    his observer, though often considerably the senior in age and experience.5. A further point to which I wish to draw attention is the,&apos; effect of any relative rank assigned to the executive branches of the three services on the J    technical, administrative and other branches.   It does not appear1 either just or reasonable, for instance, that a Medical Officer who enters the Royal Navy as a Lieutenant should, if he enters the R.A.M.C. or the R.A.F., ent\er in a rank j    relatively lower. \I       S. H.Air Ministry, 7th December, 1922. \[9187]
