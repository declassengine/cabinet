(Printed for the Cabinet.       December 1922.)SECRET.CP. 4363.CABINET.Proposed Legislation in India to amend the Criminal Procedure affecting the Trial of Europeans.In continuation of the memorandum circulated as CP. 4320 on the 23rd November, 3 circulate below a summary of the opinions of the Local Governments in India (excepting those of the Government of Madras, which have not so far been received) on the proposed changes in the law of criminal procedure.PEEL.. December 1922.Summary of the Opinions of Local Governments on the Proposals of the Racial Distinctions Committee.The Bombay Government accept the proposals, subject to the following-reservations : (i) They are strongly opposed to the proposed definition of European British subjects in so far as it will exclude from that class persons born or domiciled in the Dominions and Colonies.(ii) They are opposed to the proposal to repeal sections 460 and 461 of the Code, and would leave the position of non-British Europeans and Americans unchanged.(iii) They would not limit the right of appeal from the verdict and sentence in jury trials to cases in which the jury were not unanimous or in which, the jury being unanimous, the judge did not agree with them. They would extend the right to all cases, including those in which the jury were unanimous and the judge agreed.(iv) They would provide a bench of two and not three judges to hear appeals from High Court Sessions. They consider two judges sufficient and three as likely to involve disorganisation of the Courts work or an accession to its strength.(v) They express doubts as to the practicability of securing a jury of nine for all murder cases.The Bengal Government accept the proposals (which they do not regard as likely to involve any appreciable increase of expenditure), but make the following-suggestions : (i) It should be considered whether the procedure to be applied to the trial of &quot; warrant eases &quot; in which racial considerations are involved should not be applied to the trial of cases under sections 109 and 110 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against European British subjects.(ii) They think that it is going too far to provide that racial considerations shall be deemed to be involved in all cases in which one of the parties is a European and the other an Indian.(iii) They doubt the feasibility of a special mixed bench of magistrates to &quot;deal with &quot; racial &quot; summons cases, as it will be almost impossible inmost . places to secure two magistrates of approximately equal status and seniority.969      100   12.2-2
The United Provinces Government &quot; consider it, desirable&quot; that the proposal should be accepted and that they afford a sufficiently satisfactory solution of a difficult question,&quot; subject however to the following qualifications :  (i) They object to - the proposal to allow an appeal against orders passed in cases tried summarily.(ii) They would accept Mr. Carey&apos;s proposal that no distinction should be drawn between &quot;summons&quot; and &quot;warrant&quot; racial cases for the purpose of determining the method of trial, and think that the bench of two magistrates proposed for the former class may often be impracticable or involve great inconvenience.The Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court is strongly opposed to the proposal to allow murder cases in which Europeans are involved to be tried in Sessions Courts. The Local Government think that his objections can be sufficiently met in specific cases by the use of the High Courts powers to transfer cases from subordinate courts to itself.The United Provinces Government do not regard the proposals as likely to involve any marked increase in work or expense if appeals are not allowed against summary convictions.The Punjab Government .accept the proposals subject only to further considera-tion of those relating to the extension of the right of. appeal in the light of estimates (Avhich have not yet been, framed) of the cost which, is likely to be involved.The Bihar and Orissa Government accept the proposals (which they do not regard as likely to involve any appreciable increase of expenditure) except thai relating to the extension of the right of appeal from the decisions of magistrates, which they deprecate and cannot regard as a necessary feature in the compromise arrived at. They also doubt the practicability of fixing the number of jurors in murder cases at nine.The Central Provinces Government accept the proposals without qualification, except that they urge that the fixing of the number of jurors at nine in murder cases will be impracticable.The Assam Government agree to the proposals (which .they do not regard as likely to involve any appreciable increase of expenditure) with the following reservations :  (i) They are opposed to an extension of the right of appeal to all sentences of imprisonment, but do not wish to press their objection &quot; if it is considered that the light of appeal can be maintained in the comparatively few imprisonment cases when Europeans are concerned only by similarly extending it to the far larger number of cases when. Indians are involved.&quot;(ii) They think the proposals for the extensions of the right of appeal against a j.ury&apos;s verdict go far beyond the necessities of the case, and do not think the mere lack of unanimity in a jury finding should be a ground for appeal.(iii) They accept &quot; with profound misgivings&quot; the special procedure proposed for the trial of racial cases, but have no alternative suggestion to offer, and regard the proposals for a mixed bench of magistrates to deal with summary cases as &quot; a particularly undesirable embodiment of the formal recognised -nition of race considerations.&quot; To this latter proposal thej&apos; are definitely opposed.(iv) They would prefer that the decision should be left to the Courts as to when racial considerations are or are not involved, and are not persuaded..as to the necessity for the presumption in all cases when the parties differ in race.The Chief Commissioner, Korth-Wesl Frontier Province, accepts the proposals without qualification.The Lieutenant-Governor of Burma &quot;accepts the committee&apos;s broad corn-promise &quot; subject to the following criticisms : (i) The test to justify a departure from the normal procedure of racial considerations being involved is not in itself a good test, though the only practicable one. it will have to be reconsidered if it is found to prejudice the lawful rights of any class or the maintenance of law and order.
(if) It is to be hoped that the narrow escape from the loss of the privilege of jury trial may lead to a considerable improvement in the sense of responsibility shown by European juries, and the obligation of the European community to remove this cause of reproach should be impressed upon them by every possible means.(iii) Is strongly opposed to the proposal that all sentences of imprisonment should be appealable, and would secure equality in the matter of appeals, not by &quot; levelling up &quot; the rights of Indians, but by &quot;levelling down &quot; the rights of Europeans,(iv) Is opposed to admitting appeals on facts from jury decisions.(v) Thinks it impracticable to increase the number of jurors in Burma.(vi) Thinks that the right to claim the special procedure for the trial? of &quot; racial cases &quot; should vest in the accused only, and not in the complainant.(vii) The proposal for a mixed Bench of two magistrates for &quot;racial&quot; summary cases is impracticable in Burma.The Chief Commissioner of Delhi accepts the proposals with, the following vations : (i) He objects to the proposed exclusion of &quot;colonials&quot; from the definition of European British subjects, and would amend the existing definition by bringing it up to date on the present lines, i.e., by describing the Colonies, &amp;c, as &quot; the European, American, iVustralasian or African Dominions, Colonies or Possessions of His Majesty,&quot; and by confining the definition to persons of European descent in the legitimate male line.(ii) He objects to the proposed extension of the right of appeal and would prefer to&apos; secure equality by curtailing the European existing rights when they exceed those of Indians.(iii) He doubts the acceptability of the main proposals for&apos; the extension of the jurisdiction and powers of magistrates and Sessions Courts over Europeans.(iv) He strongly objects to the proposed presumption that racial con-siclerations are involved&apos; in all cases when the parties are of different nationalities.(v) tie thinks the special procedure for racial cases should be capable of being invoked only by the accused and not by the complainant.
