THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY C5P HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOYBRNM3NT.0 A B I N B T. TRAPS BOARD POLIOY - PAPER BOX AMD JUT.3 TRADBS. MEMORANDUM BY TPS MHISTBR CO? LABOUR. QRBT.p. (1) I shall ho circulating shortly to my colleagues a54.general note on the policy of the Trade Boards Acts as affected by the recent unanimous report of the strong Committee presided over by the present Lord Chancellor and known as the Cave Committee: and on the new legisla-tion that will be necessary.   But two administrative points of importance require immediate decision.    In the normal way both these points would be decided Departmentally and without reference to the Cabinet, but since either may bo interpreted as indicating the attitude of the new Government to Trade Boards, I have thought it desirable to set before the Cabinet the action which I propose to take in both cases.(2) There is attached a memorandum setting out the facts in both cases in some detail.    Shortly the first case Is a proposal to remove from the scope of the acts, and of the Paper Box Trade Board in particular, the manufacture of Match boxes.    I have no doubt that a case has been established for a public inquiry into the necessity of talcing this step, which has been urged upon the Ministry by both sides of the Joint Industrial Council for the Matchmaking trade, and I propose to order an inquiry, the probable results of which may be the exclusion of the Match Box portion from the scope of the Trade Board,,   This decision may be welcomed by employers; and proceeds along the line suggested by the Cave Committee.
The question hero arises upon a request hy the Jute Board that I should confirm certain rates proposed hy them, including a piece-work list.   Apart from the piece-work list there is no serious difficulty; but as to the piece-rates, the point at issue is whether piece-rates which have been agreed substantially in the form proposed to the Trade Board outside the Board between employers and workers associations, and have in fact been and are, now in operations should be brought under the Trade Board Regulations,    The majority of the Board the workers andAppointed Members) are strongly in favour of this course; and the employers are opposed to it0Aftor hearing the arguments of all sides of the Board, I am satisfied that there is a case for the confirmation of piece-rates particularly as the agreement suggested by lord Oavexs Committee as necessary before such rates can be made statutory may be fairly claimed to have been established in this case in practice.    On the other hand, it is proposed to reduce the time-rates, with which the piece-rates are organically connected, at the end. of January. It seems to ms that it would therefore be more sensible to confirm the piece-rates when they have, been reduced pari passu with the time-rates,    I propose, therefore, to inform the Board immediately that, if new proposals for the reduction of the piece-rates now submitted are forwarded to me, to come into operation at the same time as the reduced time-rates, I shall be prepared to give favourable consideration to the application for confirmation and that on the facts now before me I do not anticipate difficulty in confirmation.I have consulted lord Cave in the matter; he agrees with the action which I propose in regard to both Matches and Jute, and unless, therefore, any objection is raised by any of my colleagues I propose to announce the decisions simultaneously within the
I should add that these two decisions will not in any way prejudice the policy to be adopted in regard to the Cave Report or Trade Boards, about which I shall submit proposals to the Cabinet in due course.(Intd.)   M.3.7th December, 1922. Ministry of Lab our *
*1 ^ 9ABHJTBLX.Suggested removal of the manufacture of Match-box making in I  match factories from the jurisdiction of the Paper Box yrade Board^The making of boxes out of paper, cardboard, chip or similar material, was included among the trades to which the Trade Boards Act of 1909 was applied by the schedule to that Aot,     The words used to describe   the trade cover the manufacture, wherever carried on, of the ordinary match-boxes used in the Match-making trade.       The scope Of the Paper Box Trade Board includes many forms of Box making other than match boxes:- the proportion of match-making is very small indeed.     It may be remembered that the conditions under which matoh-Doxes were made in the workers&apos; own homes during the earlier years )t the present century, were among those which led direotly to the Inti-sweating legislation contained in the Trade Boards Act of 1909. Since that date it has become almost the universal practice in the satoh-making trade for the match-boxes to be made in the factory in ihich the matches are produced;   the matches and the match boxes are lade by workers who in many cases are engaged interchangeably on both. X the same time there has been an increase of organisation in the latch&apos; industry which has led up to the formation of a Joint Industrial council representing almost the whole body of employers and workpeople n the match industry.   Both the employers and workpeople upon the Joint Industrial Council have represented to the Department that they H now a joint body 3trong enough to control conditions of all workers in the match factories throughout the country and to prevent the torargenoe of bad conditions upon the manufacture of matoh-boxes in the factories.     They ask, therefore, that in so far as match-boxes are &apos;a4e in match factories, the work should be withdrawn from theisdietion of the Trade Board and should be left to be controlled by foe Joint Industrial Council,     The Match employers add that they are ^ioua to avoid the duplicate control of minimum rates of wages which a involved by a small part ox their work falling under the jurisdiction ,f the Trade Board.-1-
On the other hand the Trade Board object to any curtailment of their jurisdiction, and they suggest that, should foreign match-making firms open factories in this country, the Joint Industrial Council,who have no poysrers to enforce their determinations at law, might findI.themselves unable to control the conditions in the new factories. The Trade Boards Act of 1918 contemplates the alteration of the jurisdiction of a Trade Board should it be desirable to do so.   Upon the information before me, 1 feel that the Joint Industrial Council have made out their case, at any rate to an extent which would justify me &quot;in issuing a Notice of Intention to make the ohange which they desire.      The Trade Boards Act of 1918 provides that upon the issue of such a Motioe of Intention objections must be considered, and unless such objections are met by an alteration of the draft Order, a publio enquiry by a competent person not in the employment of a Government department, must be held to consider the draft Order.     In the present case there/is little doubt that the Paper Box Trade Board would press their objections to the change and the whole matter would then be examined at a public enquiry.    I propoae, therefore, to let it be known forthwith that a Hotice of Intention to make the change will be issued in the near future.Jute Trade.     Proposed minimum rates of wages.The Board have submitted to me for confirmation minimum rates of wages to bo paid to women hessian weavers and to male &quot;tenters&quot;:-(i) the rates for the women weavers are, in the main, a set ofpiece prices for Y^ork upon looms of various sizes.    There is a long history behind this piece prioe list;    originally such a list was agreed outside the Trade Board between the employers and the workpeople and subsequently it has been recommended to the Board for adoption by the employers and the workers alternately.    It has in fact boen adopted quite apart from the working of the Trade Board and is now in operation throughouta     practically the entire trade.     The employers&apos; side of the BoardWhave represented to me that they do not wish the price list to be given statutory force under the Trade Boards- Act3.    They base
themselves in the main upon the faot that in the Report of the Committee of Enquiry into the working of the Trade Boards Acts, of which the Lord Chancellor was Chairman, there was a recommendation that in all oases piece prioos should be given statutory effect only when supported by both sides of the Trade Boards.     I have conferred with the employers, the work-people and the &quot;Appointed Members&quot;, and I am clearly of opinion that, subject to the reduction to which I refer below, the piece-rates should ultimately be confirmed, for the following reasons :-(a) The agreement as to piece-rates suggested by theCave Committee is in fact secured in this ease as rates substantially in the same form have already been agreed between employers and workers outside the Board and are now in. operation.(b) The Board have had minimum time rates in operation forsome time;  to bring the piece-rates which are already in operation outside the Board., under the scope of the Board should produce no complication, in fact the reverse.     The employers admit that they have in fact in. the past modified the agreed piece-rates as and when the Board modified the -minimum time-rates;  there is to be a reduction ofthe minimum time-rates by 0, at the end of january and if confirmed the pieoe-rates are to be reducedproportionately.Co)New legislation is required to carry out the fullproposals as to piece prices suggested by theCave Committee and the confirmation of these rates will in no way prejudice the claim of. the Juteemployers (if and when new legislation securinggreater elasticity is passed) to be released from the Trade Board  jurisdiction altogether.
9 1) Qa o oI am, therefore, in favour of confirmation but these rates are to a certain extent regulated by the time-rates for spinners who constitute the second main section of the trade.     Those time-rates are coveroa by the Board and will bo reduced, under the maohinery of the Acts, at the end of January.     It soems to me that it would be batter, therefore, to suggest to the Board that they should submit to me a piece list reduced in proportion to the time-rates so that the two may oome Into statutory operation together at the end of January.     I should accordingly propose to write to the Board saying that, if such a reduced piece list is forwarded to mo, I should bo prepared to consider it favourably and that I do not on. the facts before me anticipate difficulties in lUilgjiiwiiaIIg*u
