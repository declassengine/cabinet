(kueanae) *December 14th, 1922.P.     11.40-. a. m.       December 14th, 1922.R.       3.E0.p.m.       December 14 th, 1922.No. 118,   (D).Prolonged discussions between allied and Turkish military and naval, experts have been proceeding for setae flays.   Former have now agree a upon a plan which is to be submitted to Turks tomorrow.    It provides for demilitarisation of reduced zones on each side of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus as well as of islands at entrance to former and in the Sea of Marmora and for Turkish liberty to fortify southern shore of the latter, but absolute prohibition of all military works on the northern shore, passage free from gun fire being thus assured.    We propose to insist upon inspection of demilitarised aones both in above areas and in Thrace, but shall encounter great difficulty with Turks.A Question has now arisen on which I must seek, instructions from Cabinet.   French military and naval advisers, claiming-, that they were acting on authority of their government, told I sine t Pasha that Allies were not going to put any naval or military clauses into the treaty or in other words that Turkey may have such navy and naval establishments and armament as she pleases anfl that there will be no limit to her army except in. Thrace . and Constantinople, which it is proposed to deal with in connection with demilitarisation clauses, and no prohibition of
conscription.    1 hare thus been placed in a situation of great embarrassment inasmuch as these declarations neither conform entirely to my own sentiments nor to any instructions that I have hitherto received from His Majesty&apos;s Government. As regards navy I realise that it is unnecessary and therefore unwise to insist on restrictions, mainly because Turks will not have money to build a fleet.    But I should like to press at this stage for a limitation of submarines even if 1 hare to abandon claim later on in the process of bargaining that will probably ensuB.    I shall of course claim surrender of the &quot;Goebon&quot;. As regards array abandonment of all military clauses will mean two things (a) acceptance of conscription,  (h) possible creation of a large Turkish army in Asia Minor.    Concerning conscription 1 have argued difficulty and danger of conceding to Turkey what we have refused to Bulgaria, Hungary, Austria and Germany.    To this my military advisers replied that any insistence upon voluntary service will be absolutely rejected by Turks and will be entirely inopportune since any form of inspection or control in Asia Minor is out of the question.    I cannot resist this argument and am disposed -to give way while endeavouring in miaor-ity clauses of treaty to secure exemption by compounding for minorities in Asia Minor.    As to future Turkish army in Anatolia while I realise that this may he a danger to Mesopotamia 1 do not see&apos;hoi? any; provisions in -treaty could - prevent it.   I see-no alternative therefore, ease having been in main given away, but to acquiesce in -abandonment of military clauses European army of Turkey being, limited in manner .already suggested&quot; on lines originally proposed by Marshal 2Pooh.    I should be glad, however, to know that in taking this line I shall have the support of His Majesty1s Government,Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1. 15th -Deoember, 1922.- g -
