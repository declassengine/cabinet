uk&amp;cploymsht   proposals. . memorandum by tub miihsesr op labour.The Cabinet will shortly have under consideration a Report by the Cabinet Unemployment Committee reviewing the plans for relieving Unemployment which aro already in operation and mating certain suggestions by way of additional schemes. When the Report is considered, I proposo to raiso certain points, and it may bo convenient for my colleagues in the Cabinet if I indicate beforehand what those points aro. 1. Having regard to the declarations that have boonmade on behalf of the Government and to the statement in the King&apos;s Speech to the effect that we are examining the plans of the late Government with a view to their continuanoo &quot;and extension&quot;,    the Report of the Cabinet Unemployment Committee is somewhat meagre;    the old plans, e.g. the further  10 millions at the disposal of the St^David^ Committee and the extension of the Trades Facilities Act guarantees by a further  25 millions have already been made public and the additional proposals amount only to somathing like  350,000 for new schemes. Of this sum about  300,000 will, under the schemes proposed, be allocated to Land Drainage, Afforestation and Rural Roads. I welcome this arrangement, as very little has been done so far for road unemployment, and agricultural labourers do not oome within the Unemployment Insurance Acts - but the fact that of the very limited new proposals far the larger proportion is to be spent in rural areas and much of it in improving landed property, is bound to be the subject of criticism in the House.
2. Accordingly I think it is advisable that in any statement that is made about the intensions of the Government in relation to Unsisployment, emphasis should be laid upon the faot that we are getting into touch immediately with big industrial corporations, the railway companies, etc., urging them to press on with development schemes on &amp; large scale.    If possible I would suggest that the Prime Minister should himself call together leading representa-tives of big Railway and other companies and put the matter strongly to them.    And, if adopted, I suggest it would be desirable that the Prime Minister should allow it to be known publicly that he is taking this course. I have been within the last 24 hours in touch with the big Colliery interests.    I am assured that normal devslop-ment is many years in arrear and should before long be taken in hand on a large scale.    I would therefore suggest in this case also that the Prime liinister might consider calling a meeting of leading Coal Owners. 3. There will undoubtedly be a demand in theHouse of Commons for a big immediate extension of the Relief Schemes.    I hope that the policy of calling representatives of big Railway, Colliery and other companies together and urging upon them the immediate taking in hand of development, can be announced to the House; and, in addition, I think it should be stated that the Cabinet Unemployment Committee * are pressing on the examination of other schemes and that they will confer with Lord St. David&apos;s Committee as to possible developments.    The fact must be faced that, allowing for all the Government schemes now in contemplation, they will afford employment during
the next four or five months for probably not much more than 100,000 and in vie-.v of the promise in the j ing&apos;s Speech of &quot;extension&quot;, I suggest that the Cabinet should contemplate a further extension of Schemes, either through Lord St.David&apos;s Comiuittee or otherwise, up to at least  5 millions;    this could be put in hand at once, but the Government payments of Interest and Sinking Fund would not begin to mature till the next Financial Y^ar.4.     Last winter we lid. something by way of the acceleration ot Government contracts, e.g. over  500,000 was spent, mainly on accelerating schemes for the laying of new post Office cables;    further, the Office of 7orks was authorised to speed up, and a certain amount of additional work was provided. This was, in my view, a good move.      I understand that nothing on these lines is being lone for this //inter.      I think all the Government Departments concerned should be asked at once to consider what could be done within reasonable limits to accelerate work.     I might remind, the Cabinet that it has for many years been advocated that the Government and public authorities should make it their business to put forward contracts luring times of depression, specifically with a view to relieving unemployment.5.     Finally,  I would like to call the attention of the Cabinet to the decision of the Cabinet Unemployment Committee not to authorise me,  in association with the Board of Education, to open Juvenile Employment Centres in a number of the principal industrial areas .;h3re unemployment is at its worst. 2he amount for which I asked &quot;iras originally  110,000, but it is obvious now that nothing like this amount could be spent in this financial year, and having regard to the desirability of minimising the amount of any Supplementary Estimates I
reduced my suggestion to  50,000. of which not more than  40,000 will be spent in this financial year. 6.      I would urge the Cabinet to agree to my proposal. There are 200,000 juveniles unemployed today;    they are not helped by the ordinary Relief Schemes and the resulting problem Is a very serious one      ye cannot, of course, hope to tackle anything like this number, nor do I suggest that wo should do so;   but I am convinced that some attempt on the part of the Government to deal with the very serious evil that is resulting from the deterioration of these juveniles, especially the boys, would be widely welcomed. Ho juvenile between 16 - 18 would be entitled to benefit unless he attended:    the classes would be largely vocational In character and co-operation of employers enlisted with a view to securing employment afterwards.     pother class for whom it is difficult to do anything by vvay of Relief Torks i.e. unemployed women, have already been assisted by a Government Grant of  100,000 in aid of training.(Intd)    M.
