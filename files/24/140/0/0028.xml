[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government^JQ printed for the Cabinet.       November 1922.SECRET.CP. 4328.memorandum by the secretary of state for india as to the steps to be taken in order to to improve the recruitment of british-born subjects for the indian civil service.I.The failure of the supply of European candidates is no new phenomenon, and early this year Mr. Montagu appointed a strong Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord MacDonnell, to consider the position.   This Committee reported in July.It found that the disinclination to join the Indian Services is &quot;mainly due to the reports reaching this country regarding the feeling of men now serving in India,&quot; and that this feeling was due to three principal causes : &quot; the uncertainty of the position of the Services under the reformed constitution,&quot; &quot; the atmosphere of intense hostility created by the recrudescence of racial feeling,&quot; and &quot;insufficiency of pay and the growing expensiveness of life in India.&quot;The Committee noted that the progressive Indianisation of the Services was part of the avowed policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government ; that in pursuance of this, the percentage of Indian recruitment in the Indian Civil Service had been fixed at 33 per cent., to be increased annually by 1-3,- per cent, until it reached 48 per cent, of the annual recruitment in 10 years&apos; time ; but while, on the one hand, the Montagu-Chelmsford Report had emphasised the importance of not suddenly swamping the Services, on the other hand the Committee held that &quot; no reduction of the sanctioned scale of recruitment of Indians can be made without exposing the Government to a valid charge of breach of faith &quot; before the expiry of the first decennial period. At the same time, &quot; any increase in the recruitment of Indians . . . must make the difficulties of recruitment more acute than at present.As regards the position of the Services in India, the Committee observed that apprehension was particularly prevalent as to the future of the District Officer, who used to be the pivot of the administration, but whose work is thought to be greatly changed by the reforms. The possibility that careers might be cut short by the progress of reforms ; that European officers would not be fairly treated by Indian superiors; that European doctors would no longer be forthcoming in sufficient numbers ; and that members of the Services and their wives and families would live in a perpetual atmosphere of racial animosity all these are factors in discouraging candidates from coming forward. Finally, there is uncertainty as to the wishes and&quot; policy of Government itself : &quot; Does Government really want more Englishmen to go to India ?   And, if so, why don&apos;t they say so ? &quot;The remedies proposed by the Committee may be summarised as follows : (1) &quot;The Committee consider it now to be essential . . . that the Government of India should issue in due time and place an emphatic statement of their intention to support District Officers in the exercise of the legal authority vested in them for the maintenance of law and order.&quot;(2) Recruitment &quot;under the Indian Civil Service (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1915 to supplement open competition, ex-service men being especially^ selected.(3) Improvements in pay, the right to commute the whole of their pensions (instead of one-third only), and compensation for loss of their career for those who retire prematurely on proportionate pensions.(4) Provision of more European doctors, housing allowances, and concessions in respect of passages.(5) Further retrospective effect to the concession recently granted of the refund of their 4 per cent, annuity contribution.(6) Propaganda at the Universities, and above all measures &quot; to remove the current misconception that the services of Englishmen are no longer essential for the welfare of India, and that Government does not very actively desire them to go there.&quot;5905
(7) If possible the insertion in the covenants of members of the Covenanted. Services of some guarantee as to security of position and pension.The Committee think that these measures &quot; will improve matters.&quot; The on.lv alternative they can suggest is the appointment of a Royal Commission, but they fear that this will only stimulate racial feeling. &quot; But if the Secretary of State could see his way to making a Parliamentary declaration in supplement of the declaration of 20th August 1917, especially dwelling upon the gradual procedure prescribed by the declaration, and) quoting the passages iD the Montagu-Ohelmslord Report [on the I subject of the recruitment of Indians], emphasising in particular the necessity for European association in the local administration, it-would have a beneficial effect both in India and on recruitment in Great Britain.&quot;In a very important Appendix signed by all the members&apos;of the Committee I except Lord MacDonnell, the signatories recognise that their proposals are merely palliatives ; that the provision of funds for them is &quot; m existing circumstances out of I the question,&quot; and would, moreover, by adding to the cosr. of the European Services, I stimulate the demand for more rapid Indianisation ; and they think that the real I question is &quot; whether the Services, or at least some of them, may not have to he I completely reorganised, and recruitment placed on a new basis, and those more I especially in which the maintenance of a European element is not deemed primarily I essential so recast as to adapt them to Indian standards of pay, on lines consonant I not only with the new constitutional developments, but with the growing need for I public economy.&quot;The Report of the Committee was examined by a Special Committee of my 1 Coinicil in July. . This Committee considered that the Report raises issues of first- I rate importance, which must be closely considered by the Government of India before the Secretary of State in Council can arrive at any decision. The Report has accordingly been referred to the Government of India.for their opinion, which has not v yet been received. The Government of India have been asked to. reply as soon as I possible, but consultation of the Local Governments will be necessary, and it may he j some; time before they are in a position to address me by despatch. Meanwhile I j .can only offer provisional opinions.(i) As regards the position of. the District Officer, it is clearly impossible for j. Government to give an assurance, which would have any validity that they will I support him right or wrong. . But there has possibly been a tendency recently to I undermine the responsibility of District Officers by requiring reference to Govern-ment in matters which legally lie within his competence. That is a tendency which j; the Government of India might well he called upon to check.(ii) The proposal to supplement open, competition by special means has already 1 been taken up, and the Government of India hope to recruit between 20 and 30 i ex officers of the Indian Army under the Indian Civil Service (Temporary Provisions) jj Act. Appointments under this Act, however, must be completed by August 1924, g and as men recruited under it will require at least a year&apos;s training, it will only help 1 -tis for one year more. It should be noticed, that in this matter the Secretary of State i lfor India is entirely in the hands of the Civil Service Commissioners,, since, by [j &quot;Statute no one can be appointed to the Indian Civil Service except upon their 1 certificate.(iii) As regards &quot;pay, the position is extremely difficult. On the one hand, it may j be.admitted that the Indian Civil Service, or at all events the married men, have j some grievance.   The pay was revised as recently as December 1919, and represents&apos; on paper a considerable increase on the rates previously in force.   But it was fixed  j with the idea of a 2s. rupee, and the rupee (after rising for a short time to about f 2s. 6d\) is now below Is. Ad., and prices remain very high: the net result being that the  Government of India have stated that   it is  doubtful if  the  average improvement in the financial position throughout the Indian Civil Service amounts to more than 8 per cent.   It seems clear that the cost of living for Europeans in India  j has risen at least 60 per cent, since .1914-.   On the other hand, there are the two facts  i admitted by the Committee themselves : (a) That the present financial situation I4 precludes any substantial increase in pay, and the Viceroy has recently, so informed ,a I deputation ; (h) that any increase in the cost of the European Services would increase I the political discontent and the demand for a reduction in their numbers.   Yet If
European Services are essential, and if they are to be obtained -must&apos;be paid at the market rate, and it may well be that the only escape from this dilemma is that hinted at by the Committee - a recoustitution of these Services on a smaller&apos; but,definite scale, and on the rates of pay necessary to attract the best Englishmen to them. The question raised is so large that it seems useless to say more on it here. ,,&apos;,Jt will be examined: with the greatest care and without any delay.(iv) The Committee ask for compensation for the loss of a career ; and ethers who have written on this subject have indicated that unless a guarantee against loss of career can be given there is no hope of men joining the Services. It is possible that there is some misunderstanding here. At present there is no question of compulsory retirement. Indianisation is proceeding by limiting the recruitment of Europeans, and those who are retiring from, the Services are doing so voluntarily on terms which, though they do not include compensation, give to those who feel that they cannot conscientiously remain proportionate pensions to which they would not otherwise be entitled. The right of the Crown to&apos; dismiss cannot be. abrogated, and will doubtless be used on sufficient occasion. It is being used now in the British and Indian Armies and in the Navy, and civilians can hardly expect a greater security of tenure than that enjoyed by their military and naval brethren.- But if compulsory retirement is resorted to in. such circumstances, compensation is practically inevitable.(v) The provision of European doctors presents two difficulties. At present the higher medical needs of India are met by the Indian Medical Service a military. Service with a civil branch. This Service monopolises all the best medical posts in India, and in respect of no other is the demand for Indianisatiou stronger or more plausible dialectically. Indianisation is proceeding on the basis of So-J- per cent, in theory, but in practice the percentage is higher because British candidates are not forthcoming and the British vacancies are remaining unfilled. This is the second difficulty, and it may no doubt be partly accounted for by the readjustment in professional prospects which is still taking place as a result of&apos; the war. So far as Indian conditions are concerned, it appears to be due, not so much to insufficient pay (for the pay has recently been increased by 50 per cent, and apparently gives satis-faction, at all events for the moment) as to the uncertainty of the future. Health is one of the transferred subjects ; in the provinces the civil medical officers already find themselves under Indian Ministers ; and how they will be treated remains to be seen. Apart from racial considerations common to all the Services&apos;, it is to be noticed that elected members of Indian Legislatures have begun to ask for Government recognition and support of the traditional Oriental systems of medicine, which are hardly reconcilable with modern science. It is impossible to make any positive suggestion for remedying this state of things at present, but the vital importance of the subject is fully realised.(vi) It was arranged that the late Prime Minister should make a statement in the House of Commons with the object (among others) of dispelling the belief that Englishmen, are not wanted, and of saying what could be said regarding security of prospects and pension. A statement was accordingly made by Mr. Lloyd George on 2nd August, but unfortunately, while it gave rise to much criticism on the part of spokesmen of Indian political opinion, in the Legislature and elsewhere, it did not achieve the desired result of reassuring the Services. The psychological factor in the discontent of the Services appears to have been very little, if at all, abated. It is, however, possible that the Services have been led, under the influence of a general sense of grievance, to look to obtain guarantees of security in a more positive form than is constitutionally practicable ; and that if specific hardships were remedied they would be better satisfied with guarantees that can practicably be offered.Of the financial measures recommended by the Committee the two that would probably be taken tip first, when the state of Indian finances permits, are the grant of free or assisted passages to officials and their wives and families when proceeding on leave, and some increase in the overseas pay of officials in their later years of service. But as regards the first of these measures, apart from the financial stringency, the -Secretary of State is faced with the difficulty that, whereas the salaries&apos; o  the All-India Services are under his control, allowances are subject to the vote of the various pro-vincial legislative bodies in India unless they can be brought within the definition of &quot; Salary,&quot; and it is questionable whether passage allowances can be brought within -the definition without unduly straining it. It is possible therefore, that an -amendment of the Act may prove to be necessary to enable the conditions of the
Services in respect of their allowances to he improved without constant friction with the Indian Legislatures.If an all-round increase of salary is found to be essential the question will be raised which the MaeJDonnell Committee have indicated, viz., whether it is not necessary to scrap the Services in their present forms and reconstitute them on altogether new terms to meet new conditions. This would probably involve enquiry by a Royal Commission ; and the Special Committee of the Council of India to which reference was made above arrived at the conclusion that this was the only means of dealing effectually with the problem. They suggested that the Royal Commission, if appointed, should enquire &quot; into the function of the European under the Government of India Act, 1919 ; the measures required to secure that the necessary European element shall be contented and efficient ; the effecting of economy throughout the Civil Services generally, with special reference to the employment of Indians and their standard of remuneration ; and the extent to which the&apos; administrative arrangements in India and the constitution, organisation and terms of recruitment of the Services require revision with reference to these objects.&quot;PEEL..25th November 1922.
