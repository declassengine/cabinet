THIS DOOUilEiMT IS THE PROPERTY 01 HIS BRITAN6I0 MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERHHEHT.ECRET.CABINET.JUVENILE UNEMPLOYMENT CENTRES.    &quot; 567. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.      On the 50th Hoveaber I was authorised to announce inParliament that the question of the establishment of juvenile unemployment Centres was under consideration by the Presidentof the Board of Education and myself and that it was hoped that oo-operation in eemmusai-eatdtm .with Local Authorities wo should come to some arrangement by which Government help could be given.2.      I have consulted with tho President of the Board of Education,  the Secretary for Scotland and the Treasury and we have agreed upon a scheme which will give the option to Local Education Authorities to establish Centres in areas in which abnormal unemployment among juveniles exists, 75$ of the cost to be borne by the Exchequer and 25$ by the Local Authorities concerned.    The total oost for a period of three months, assuming most of the Looal Education Authorities In these aroas take up the Scheme,  should not exceed  25,000,  of which  12,500 will fall in the present xinancial year.3.      I propose to take action accordingly in the absence of any expression of dissent irom any of ny colleagues within the next few days.    I must, however, add that, in view of experience in the past, and of the great pressure on local Rates, I am doubtful if Local Authorities will find theraselves able to start the necessary Centres on the basis of a 75$ grant.(Initialled) M.B.Ministry of Labour, December 18th 1922.
