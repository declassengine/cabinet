Headquafters seem determined to insist on interviewing Ministers.The London District Council of the National Unemployed Workers^ Committee Movement is arranging approcesaion of unemployed to the Cenotaph on Armistice Day.The Young   Communist League does not seem to have received funds from the Berlin Bureau reoently and is short of money.
;1 1?HE gHIHD IBTSBMSJaSJOt AND Q?HB GMBRAji BflgQglONShe following remarkable manifesto has &quot;been issued asa special supplement to the &quot;International PressCorrespondence&quot;, which is published by the West BharopeanBureau of the !ghird International in Berlin and constitutesone more convincing proof of Mo scow &apos;s policy of interference in the domestic affairs of this country:BTO THB WOEEING- MM AND WOEKING WOMEN OP GBEATBRITAIN J&quot;Comrades,&quot;Within the next few days you will be called upon to express your opinion through the ballot box, upon li the policy conducted in Britain during the last four years by the dominant class as represented by the Government of ULoyd Georges     The elections in Britain are not only the concern of the workingmen and working-women of Britain, but also that of the international proletariat;    for Britain is the strongest capitalist power in Europe.     It exploits millions of workers and peasants all over the world, and upon the party that is in power depends the fate of the workers and peasants in many countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. For that reason, the Communist International, the international organisation of the advanced workers of all countries, considers it its duty to express its opinion on the domination of your capitalist class, and to say what the workers of other countries expect from you.Homes Pit for Heroes.&quot;When you were fighting In the war for the interests of your masters and when they were compelled, not only; with the aid of the blood of the workers in the trenches, but also by the hard labour of your women and children, they assured you that when German: militarism was defeated they would introduce democracy into Britain, build homes fit for heroes, and create for them conditions of life worthy of human beings.   These promises were   \ solemnly repeated during the general election of November 1910.   But judge them by their deeds.   In Britain afc the present moment, unemployment is rife to a degree never before experienced in your industrial country.    &apos;&amp; The capitalists are taking advantage of this unemployment to force down your wages, to deprive you of the gains won by the trade unions after a struggle of a century and a half.   Shroughout the whole period of the war were demanding the nationalization of the mines. You declared that you were prepared to toil in the bowels of the earth not for the benefit of a handful of coal kings, but for the benefit of the whole community^; In 1919 your Government declared that if the parliamentary Commission, appointed to enquire into the question, reported in favour of the nationalization of the mines^ .it would do so.    The sankey Commission did report in   ; favour of the nationalization of the mines, but the government failed to carry out the proposal, and now the fight/
fight is no longer cenirred&quot;rxrund the qfues-fcLon of natj112avion but for the defence, of your miserable standard of existence against the airtaois of the capitalists. And if the workers dare to demonstrate their existence in the streets, they are batoned by the government forces. The government which spent  20,000,000 in three days on the Hear Eastern adventure declared that it had no money with which to aid the unemployed.    The housing crisis is still as severe as ever.    The workers are huddled together in slums, whilst the war profiteers are building themselves palaces.    The general standard of life of the workers to-day is lower than it was before the war, - and this in spite of the hundreds of thousands of lives that were sacrificed in the fields of Flanders, Gallipoli and Mesopotamia for the domination of the British bourgeoisie. ;The &quot;last War&quot;,  the Forerunner of Other Wars.&quot;When you were called upon to sacrifice your lives \ upon the battle fields you were told that this will be    &apos; the last war;   that if the Allies were victorious they, led by Great Britain, would bring about disarmament, the  reedam of all nations, and the organisation as the woild in the interest of the whole *f humanity.     You believed: this, and shed your blood for the sake of the future happiness of your children.   But, after they had won the&quot; war, the Allies resolved to enslave half the world, Germany, Turkey, Austria and Bulgaria were compelled to pay heavy&quot; tribute that would enslave them for half a oentury.   Russia, which lost 10,000,000 men in the war for the cause of the Allies, was sentenced to death because it was the first that dared to throw off the burden of the war, and raise- its \ hand against the conclusion of the world war, your    . government conducted a war against Seviet Russia, against the peasants and workers of Russia and spent tens and millions of pounds in order to destroy its railways and &quot;bridges, flood the mines, and t* crush with the iron hand of famine the revolt of the Russian workers against the domination of capital.    Turkey was dismemfcered, and when, with their last remaining strength, your government threw against them its Greek vassals, supplying them with money and munitions.     All this was done by a handful of irresponsible people.   Lloyd George and Lord Cur*2*n always presented their Parliament in which they had an enormous .; majority, with an accomplished fact as if to demonstrate that all the talk about democracy in Britain we&amp; mere deception.   Even during the recent danger of a fresh war in the Near East, Lloyd George, while spending millions of the people rs money, did not even call Parliament together.&quot;The policy of your government has roused the burning hatred towards Britain of the toiling masses of Russia, Turkey and the whole of the Mohammedan East.    The Indian , workers and peasants and the Egyptian workers and peasants have grown to hate British rule.    Instead of disarmament,X the policy of your government has led ta anglo^Amsrrican competition, and Franco-British contest for supremacy. Britain is politically isolated.    Its policy is leading to certain new international wars.     The league ef Nations., which was to have served as an instrument to prevent futyage. wars, is a powerless puppet in the hands of your government, bereft of all power and even moral authority.
The Lab our party &quot;Li&amp;^ Not., Fight.&quot;When we, the advanced workers of all countries, sum up the rasalts of the four years of the politics of British capitalism, we ask ourselves, - how did the workers of Brit a la combat the criminal policy of fchair government? We watched with pride how you in serried raaka attacked the fortress of British Capitalism, the strike waves of 1919 and 1920, and the energy with which you fought against intervenl*ie:a in Russia.    But we were saddened to observe how your struggle was retarded and defeated, not so much by the forces of the properties classes as by the policy of your own leaders - the  trace union leaders and the Parliamentary leaders of the Labour Party-     We followed very closely the debates in Porliamenb, and waited expectantly to hear voices from the Labour benches esrpressing what you thought,    When you took action against the attempts to suppress the Russian Revolution, when you sabotaged the shipment of arms against your Russian brothers and threatened your government with direct revolutionary action, your leaders could only give utterance to a pitiable lisp, and dared not even protest against the attempt to declare the Russians a plague-suiicken people.    When at armritsar, General Dyer brought shame upon the English people by his atrocious murder of hundreds of unarmed and peaceful Indians, not one of your representatives dared to hurl from their places in Parliament the charge of executioner against this representative of the British dominant class.&quot;Can it even be said that they defended your immediate every-day interests which the capitalists are now attacking? Eq3 even that cannot be said..    The needs ox the suffering f unemployers found no ringing echo in Parliament.   Your representatives know how to beg but they dared not demand, for they could never resolve to take up the struggle outside of Parliament to support their demand.    On the contrary, their work outside of Parliament consisted in restraining the workers and defeating the class struggle.    The mere mention of &quot;Black Priday57 brings a blush of shame to the cheeks of all class-rconscious workers.     In reading the story of the betrayal of the Triple Alliance you must come to the conclusion that there is nothing your leaders fear so much as your struggles.    That is because you have allowed your Parliamentary and trade union leaders always to put off the struggle, and when finally it broke out, they broke up the ranks of the fighting workers by secret negotiations with the employers1 representatives.    This is because you have tolerated their policy in Parliament of pitiful complaints&apos; and requests, and for this reason you, the most numerous and strongest detachment of the international vrorking-class, must see your position growing worse, must look on helplessly af the exploiting adventurist policy of your government preparing for new wars right under your very nose.Down With the Capitalist Government - Long Live a labour government!Working Men and Working Women of Great Britain,&quot;We appeal to you on the eve of the elections.    Surely there is no need for us to tell you not to vote for the bourgeois parties irrespective of whether they call themselves Conservatives, Coalition Liberals, or Independent Liberals.&apos; Yftio of you does not understand that you can have no confidence in butchers and profiteers, no matter under what title theymay/
may stand?   Who of you d oe s .jaot^und^rstand that - Boaar .Law will conduct the same poXicy as was eonducte-d by Lloyd George and that Asquith and Grey, whose hands are steeped in the imperialist policy which led to the war, if returned to power, would conduct exactly the same policy as the conservatives?   Those who do not understand this will yet learn, in the school of their own poverty and inequality, these will only be convinced by the blow of the dominant class.    You politically organised workers of Great Britain believe that an improvement in your conditions can only come about when the Labour Party has secured a majority in Parliament and when a Labour Government has been established.wIn this connection we would say the following:&quot;We, the Communist International, watch the policy of the Labour Party with deep regret.   We too stand for securing a majority in Parliament,  and for a Labour Government.   We call upon all Comnrunist working men who have been fighting all the time against the betrayal of the Interests of labour by the leaders of the Labour Party, to vote for the Labour Party candidates.    We say to the working-class of Great Britain, &quot;Down with the capitalist goveramenl?, long live a Labour governments&quot;In the event of a victory at the elections, however, we warn you against the polipy of the Labour party and of that Labour Government.     We ask you, will Carson and Curzon submit to the will of a Parliamentary majority if the interests of the money-bags are affected, or would they not commence civil war against the labour Government? Every one who knows the blood-stained policy of the dominant class of England j everyone 7/he knows the means by which it &apos; has maintained pewer in India and ir -Dgypt, and the means&apos; by uhich they established thair power in England, those who recall the days of Peterl^e and the ruthless struggle against the glorious Labour Party, the Chartists, will not doubt for a moment that the British capitalists, landlords and \militarists, will declare war against a Labour Government&apos; that dares to protect the interests of the working-class. ;. If you seriously desire to have a labour Government and seriously wish to use it as an instrument in your struggle against exploitation, then you must understand that you   I must be prepared either to support this Labeur Government with all your revolutionary strength and direct action, er that government will be merely a puppet in the hands, of yfur dominant ol&amp;eses, not daring to raise a finger against the&apos;   / privileges of the capitalists, mine-otsners^and colonial pirates.   -   P*r that reason we think that the primary task of the Communists is to prove to the broad masses of the workers of Britain that it is impossible to restrain the      v beasts of prey of capitalism by means of ballot papers, and;! that the only means of putting an end to its policy is the powerful organisation of the working-class, united by an  : ironwill to fight for its interests.    When the Labour Party in its election contest, tells you that it stands for the costs of the war being imposed upon the capitalists and the abolition of unemployment, ask the leaders-of the Labour Party how they propose to bring this about.    The most shameless and reactionary capitalist ^Morning Post1, the organ of the Right Wing of the Conservative Party, epenly laughs at the Labour Party&apos;s election address and calls it a TPastoral&apos;,     We ask you, workers of Great Britain, do
m   5   **you hope to convert &quot;the &apos;^lves-in^o---liunbe--1&amp;y--mea^ of. a parson18 sermon?&quot;If the Labour Party, on coming into power, will conduct a policy of sermon preaching, you will he defeated, the Labour Party and its Government will be the cause of another great disappointment to the working-class and the days of such a government will be days of treachery to your interests. We are convinced from the Labour party&apos;s past that if it secures a majority its policy will be &amp; policy of deception and the &quot;betrayal of your interests.   Nevertheless we say to the Communist working man - vote for the Labour party. Since the majority of British workers still believe in the; Labour Party and are not convinced that only by ruthless struggle against exploitation can the working-class secure; its rights.   Communist working men must not prevent the majority of the working-class from learning from the experienc es of the Labour party, what a working-class policy should not be and what it should be.    We are convinced that only this practical experience will put you workers who still helieve in the labour Party on the right path.   We call upon Communists to vote for the L&amp;bour Party candidates, but at the same time to speak the whole truth about its past and future polioy.You Will Be Compelled To Fight.Working Men and Working Women of Great Britain,&quot;The class conscious workers of other countries watch your policy with deep concern and ask - how much longer will it be before the great British working-class, that giant shackled in the chains of capitalist ideas and capital, ist  . falsehoods, abstain from taking up the fight for its interessees-tsr; We, knowing the glorious past of the British working classy  &quot; which at one time was the pioneer of the world labour        ? movement, and which was the first to put forward the motto that only those who labour have the right to rule the state, we are convinced that you will enter the fighting ranks of the international,working-class.   Exploiting the whole world, the British capitalist have thrown you crumbs from their &quot;bounteous table.    The ruling class in Britain succeeded in holding up your victorious march onwards during the last 70 years.   But that period has now ended.    The British bourgeoisie is surrounded by enemies.    It is menaced by the powerful competition of America and also of Japan, and industry is developing in its colonies.   Surrounded by a ring of other capitalist States, will no longer be able to feed you with scraps from its table.   Your exploitation will become more intensified and not less. The British bourgeoisie is no longer the first sea power.     It is suffering defeat in the Near East.   It will strive to intensify your exploitation iand increase pressure upon you, and you, who to-day hope to restrain your increasing impoverishments by the petitions :: and good conduct of your leaders, will be compelled to fight and the British Communists, who to-day represent a small minority of the British working-class, will more and more become the voice of your desperation and the organisers of your struggle.   To-day they forewarn you, to-morrow, however^ you will be convinced of the correct&apos;-Ee8s of their policy, an^ you will take your place in the serried ranks of the Proletarian Communist International for joint struggle and&quot; joint victory.   Let the forthcoming elections hasten the dayof/

of the hanks, and only gradually, In aooo.rd.ance--wLth-^.. its technical strength and capacity, pass to a Socialist economic system...&quot;The European Communists Mast Win Over the Working Classee.o A word with regard to England.    The Communist Party there is still a successful agitation and. propaganda organisation and not a party which is able to.assemble the masses behind it.    But in England the circumstances are becoming continually more favour-able for us, not only within the limits of the Communist Party, but with the whole working class.&quot;Lloyd George*s Gift to the Soviet Government.&quot;To-day we received a telegram announcing the resignation of Lloyd George.   His was the only government that was older than our own (laughter).    It is evident that of all government we are the most firmly established-    That is a charming present from Lloyd George to our anniversary in order not to grieve us (laughter)a    That probably means a new eleotion in England *    The new election means the conflict of three main groups, the Conservatives, the Unionists and the Independent Liberals, as a result of which, it is not impossible that the power goes Into the hands of a ooalition of the Labour Party with the Independent Liberals...&quot;In the two European countries, in England and France a change is taking place in the regime.   In England this is already accomplished...But, comrades, all. these underlying facts at Tshioh I speak arise from the one fact that we in Europe are still in the period of preparing the inner organisation of the Communist Parties, in the period of struggle for influence over the working masses.     This means that we, the Soviet Republic, must give to the Communist Parties of Europe 1, 3 or  3 years for work of preparation, and this preparatory work is mush harder than with us,: because there, the enemy is much more clever and rational; in all European countries we see the formation of counter-revolutionary Fascist! bands, which was not the case with &apos;us...&quot;Education of our Youth is a Vital  Question forthe Party.&quot;At the 4th Congress of the Communist International where we shall again consider the international situation, we will reassert that we stand firmly upon our feet, and &apos; we were able to do so first, because we have learned to manage and manoeuvre the soviet apparatus, and secondly, because we learned and are learning to control the membership of our Party.   A new government power will not appear on the European horizon before the lapse of some \ months or some years, and we will then be able to work under better conditions than in the last five years.   We are not, however, assured against a recurrence of capitalist madness, even against a renewal of war.    The Increase of the revolutionary pressure in Europe can only be the signal for a new assault upon Soviet Russia. The rise of the proletarian power in Germany - and history apparently will unravel the threads from Russia over Germany to the West - faces us with tasks whichextend,/
extend far beyond the limits of our own interior re-construction.&quot;Por the solution of the do tasks it is necessary to rejuviuate our Party to create a mighty roserve of youths   And when we&apos; shall repeat to the Communist Parties:    r3efore you European Communists seize power you must go to the masses, you must learn to oprreot your faults, you must learn to influence the masses!1 then m must say to our own Party;    &apos;Before us we have a young Party which we must retain in our hands for the -maintenance of our soviet citadel, until the proletarian revolution extends to   Europe and then throughout the whole world 1.&quot;In the same issue of the &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot; Karl radek has a two-page article on &quot;Lloyd GeorgeTs Resignation&quot;, the keynote of which is that &quot;The last gifted leader of imperialism has retired.    The last leader who possessed constructive ideas for the salvation of capitalism, no lsnger found go much power as could have helped him to carry out these ideas.    The bourgeoisie requires the stupid but strong politicians.    Tot these will not be able to save it.    The overthrow of Lloyd Georgo will open the way for a new grouping.    It will bring in its train an intense sharpening of tho International situation,&quot;THE RED IHTBHNATIOHAL 01? LABOUR UfflONS&quot;The Perspectives of the Second Congress of the RedInternational of LiVbour Unions&quot; are discussed by A. Nlnin the issue of the &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot;of November 3rd:   he considers that:&quot;Hie first Congress of the Bed &apos;International of LuJboi-r Unions has accomplished an important work: it has built the foundation of the international organisation of revolutionary unions;    it has formulated a program of concrete action and given a unified platform to the various tendencies of the left wing   unionism,   After its constituent oongress, tho llaii International of Labour Unions met with numerous difficulties.which in a measure have retarded its development.    Wo have eve rosins the greater part of these difficulties, and we have every reason to hope that after the Second Congress the final consolidation of the Red International of Labour Unions will be achieved, and put in a position to undertake its task of organisation and revolutionary activity.The/
&quot;The offensive of the reformists has assumed such proportions , that the sec-cmd Red Irrtexnational of Labour Unions Corgreps wil:3 he force a to adopt a definite line of action for the comin.g months.   We cherish unity as an idea &quot;but net as a sup3.istiti.oh.    The Russian General Federation of LEhcniC at its recent Oongre.sss decided to bring up before cur coming Second Congress the question of the formation of international trade or industrial revolutionary fedexat ionsr    Tito Euoeien Comrades who have gone to so much pains to gain, admission within these federations and who have &quot;been systematically rejected, do not wish to remain isolated any longer.    This proposition of the Russian unions is of tremendous importance and will doubtless call forth passionate debate.&quot;The situation is now much clearer than at the time of our First Congress.&quot;...Once agreement has been established within the healthy sections of revolutionary trade unionism, the disintegration of Anarchism end An&amp;rcho- Syndicalism will be precipitated.   Those who seem to fear strong powerful organisations will be able to continue their sectarian work without danger to the revolutionary international unity, by creating what the Executive Committee of the Red International of Labour Unions calls a pocket edition International.    It will be better that they remain apart from us, that they leave us definitely.    The International working class movement will gain thereby in clearness, and the Red International of Labour Unions, freed from the dead weight of subversive elements, will be enabled to devote itself   \ entirely to its revolutionary work.&quot;The Red International of Labour Unions has met with a certain lack of understanding on the part of certain Comiaunl st e lements...n...The Second Congress will give precise direction to the trade-union nuclei, so that their work may attain the maximum of efficiency.&quot;Our International must not follow in the footsteps, of its predecessors;   it must not be a mere letter-box, buij &apos; an international of action.   A period of action will now begin after the necessary first period of formation.    That is why we must define our doctrine and our tactics at our &apos; coming Second Congress.&quot;The Chief Constable of Lxcadoe informs me that a determined attempt was made last week to capture the executive of the Jute Workers&apos; Union for the Red International of Labour Unions, but was entirely unsuccessful.THE. CQMMMISTS ;The Communist Party has issued 250,000 copies of theelection manifesto quoted in last week^ report:   branches havebeen/
been informed thai; the &quot;distribution is covered by our electoralfund&quot; and have been instructed to &quot;wire immediately&quot; toHeadquarters the quantity of which they can dispose.Every effort is being made to secure the return of theCommunist candidates in Motherwell and Dundee:   Gallacher doesnot seem to be over sanguine regarding his chances and statedrecently that,&quot;We are getting crowds of workers, and whether it will all produce the desired result is another question. Its a queer old mix up and some of the electors donlt know where they are.    I believe its just about a certainty in Moral going in, altho&apos; he hasn^ nearly so good a crowd of workers as I have.    There is still a big crowd afraid of the &apos; extremist1 who will vote moderate labour, and Morel is moderate enough.His agent wrote on November 3x*d:&quot;We are getting along alright in Dundee and I am quite sure whether Gallacher goes to parliament or not we are going to make a good show.    With the different forces who are working on his behalf I believe he stands a sporting chance of squeezing through.    The whole election in Dundee is a puzsle as not for a good mmaber of years has there been such opposition to Churchill and never has he been held in such contempt by the thinking part of the population.&quot;Morel stands to get the Irish Prae State vote, while Gallaeher stands&apos; to get the Irish Republican vote and there is a big fight between those two forces in the ranks of the Irish Electorate as to who is going to have the biggest pull.    Galiacher will get a big proportion of the labour vote and then comes the unemployed vote a big proportion of which should go to Gallaehor.     Altogether it is an interesting contest and the result may be a surprise either way.    We are having great meetings hundreds being unable to get admission to all our meetings. Ours are the only meetings at which this occurs, as even Morel is not getting the crowds as we are.&quot;In connection with the Irish vote it may be mentioned that Nora Connolly has been wired for and Travcrs, an Irish Republican, has also been asked to go to Dundee.Newbold is much concerned at the lack of organisation of the women in his constituency and has sent an urgent appeal to Helen Crawfurd for help.The following interesting communication was sent onNovember/
November 4th to Alex. Geddes from the-He ad quarters--of &quot;the-........Communist Party in London: &apos;&quot;At the meeting of the Central Executive Committee held during the evening, the question of your prospective candidature for Greenock was exhaustively considered in relation to the present financial position of the Party,    Luring the day there were indications that it might be possible for us to respond to your request for some financial assistance in the way of a loan to help to meet the Returning Officer&apos;s deposit. Unfortunately, however, these prospeote failed to materialise, and the Central Executive Committee, therefore, were unable to comply with your request.&quot;.In this connection it may be mentioned that enquiries; are being made into the source from which the Communist Part  derived the funds for its election campaign.Palme Dutt stated at a meeting of London group leaders on November 4th:   &quot;Our instructions from the Third International are to run a small number of communist candidates, but concentrate all our forces on the opposition, to heckle and submerge their speeches.&quot;As an instance of communist propaganda in the constituencies interest attaches to the following questionnairewhich has been submitted to Mr. John Hodge by the Openshawbranch of the Gommunist Party and signed by him:&quot;Questions submitted to the Labour Candidate for the Gorton Constituency. Mr. John Hodge, M.P.

Recognising that the drift of events in Europe under Capital administration is towards the promotion of fresh wars of conquest, and that ere long the workers of this country will be called upon to make first sacrifice in the cause of Militarist Adventures, acting on behalf of the vested capitalist interests.

-I   12  -Answer:     Yes.In view of the enormous amount of unemployment in this country and the fact that the Governing class has shirked its full responsibility to the workless men and women in spite of their war, period promises, are you prepared to advocate as an ameliorative policy that&apos; useful work can be found,, by the Government at full trade union rates of wages for all unemployed, or as an alternative, full and adequate maintenance for they and their dependants?Answer:     lull Trade Union rates would in myopinion lead to dissatisfaction amongst the workers themselves.    I favour the alternative,In view of the continual attacks which are being made by the Capitalist    Junta upon wages, working hours, etc., will you pledge yourself to resist any attempt of the Capitalists, to use State forces, directly &quot;or indirectly, in an attack upon the conditions of the workers and to prevent the Army, Navy or Police being used as blacklegs, in any industrial dispute into which the workers may be forced by virtue of their appalling conditions of Labour?Answer:     Yes.Will you pledge yourself to resist any attempt of the State to deprive or reduce the pensions of the Sx--Sorvi.ee men or their dependants, and also to demand that greater consideration be given to all those men who were maimed and broken in the late war, by granting of adequate pensions?Answer:     Yes.In view of the&apos; ruin and devastation which has been brought about by the operations of the insane Versailles Treaty and its shattering of the Trade and Commerce of Europe, will you pledge&quot;yourself to demand the annulment of this Treaty and the Cancellation of War Debts and Indemnities, the enforcement of which is driving millions of workers in all countries into a condition of abject slavery.Answer: Generally yes, but Germany I consider should make reparation for her wanton destruction in such cases as the Lusitania.Will you pledge yourself to support the demand for full recognition of the Russian Soviet Workers Republic on the granting of substantial state loan to Russia, in order that she may be able to restore her shattered industries ana thus find useful and remunerative work for thousands of our workless operatives.

If returned to the House of Co canons will you pledge: yourself to resist any attempt to bring about any arrangement or alliance between the Labour members and any Capitalist Party Group in the House?Answera:     YesSigned   John Hodge&quot;.There is a report, as yet unconfirmed, that an anti-militarist group is functioning and consists of four members of the Communist Party and five of the Young Communist League:   the work apparently consists of supplying information with reference to recruiting, conditions in various regiments and departmental corps: the members of this group are to visit depots   and garrison towns and report anything they hear:   Cant stated recently that a new member had joined at Chatham, a youth who was in the navy and would be useful for distributing literature.A few meetings have been held in connection with the anniversary of the Russian revolution but have evoked little interest: there was an audience of about 2,000 at the meeting of the Young Communist League in Trafalgar Square on November 5th but only about 500 were communists or sympathisers. At a communist meeting held in the West Islington library on the same date and attended by about
60 people Jackson, the editor of &quot;The Communist&quot; said that &quot;Those who talk about bringing about a revolution in a constitutional way had before them the example of the Fascisti in Italy.   &quot;Where were the Socialists In Italy to-day?   They were either in hiding, or skulking in the ranks of the Fascist! to save their skins..    The same thing would happen in England if ever it should happen that thelabour Party obtained such a majority at the elections that they were able to form a Government, and attempted to carry their programme of reform.    Let them make no mistake the capitalist class talked about constitutional methods only so long as it suited their own purposes...   A revolution could only be saved for the workers if, before it took place, bands of trusted men were in existence to act, should the occasion arise, as red guards, which, in their turn, would form tho nucleus of a red army, able to beat off the attacks of - reactionaries.&quot;THE YOUUG CQMCH1ST LEAGUECharles Redfem, the national secretary of the Young Communist League has informed the Berlin Bureau of the Young Communist International that owing to the lack of funds, no delegates will attend the Moscow Congress:    it appears from this communication-that. funds are really short as far as the League is concerned as Eodfern concludes &quot;Unless meat comes at once you cannot expect any results as we are unable to carry out even tho posting of the Young C.    (Communist).. .S.O.S.       Sned meat at onoeJ&quot;The Executive of the Communist Party has decided that James Bts wart shall continue to work for the Young Communist League until the return from Moscow of the British delegates to the Third International Congress.Horace/

On November 2nd the Bolton contingent caused some trouble by wanting to split from the other contingents and the majority got diTook at Leek where difficulties were solved for the second time by Tom McKay.     A correspondent thinks that if there is any recurrence of this trouble fire may result as the men sleep on straw.The following report has been made by a correspondent who is marching with this group:nThe Unemployed contingent arrived at Leicester from Loughborough on November 7th.   At Loughborough the treatment was not very good and it was as much as Tom McKay could possibly do, was keeping the men under control from having a riot at 12 p.m.     The Scottish contingent joined the Manchester contingent at Derby;   the whole of the Scottish contingent numbered 28 in all.   Amongst the Scottish fellows is the well-known Scottish communist speaker Currle, of Glasgow and Dumfries.    It has been mentioned that all -communists will be called together and have a meeting at Northampton in the Northampton CP. rooms.    This meeting is to discuss what tactics to use during the march to London to cope with any rioting that may take place, but the men that are not Communist will be supplied with the best possible ,and available weapons during the last forty miles of the trek to Lonoon. Altogether there is about 60 CP. members in the Manchester contingent.    We are due to arrive in Northampton on Thursday, 9th, 1922.&quot;Seven of the Manchester men were obliged to abandon the march at Macclesfield, owing to illness:   a separate group of 25 led by John Richmond, of Manchester, and Thomas Kilgariff are marching independently of the main group from their city and left Birmingham for Coventry on November 7th.
