December 1922.SECRET. - -   0-.--   ; ^CP. 4856.CABINET.SPECIAL  REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.y^o. 80.     Period ended December 1, 1922.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 27th November was 1,388,001, an increase of 8,983 over the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.Coal-mining.The improvement in the Forest of Dean continues, but the outlook is uncertain. There is no sign of improvement in the Bristol area. The position is good in the Midlands, and present and future prospects are thought to be good in the Yorkshire and Durham coalfields. Most of the centres in Lancashire and Scotland show at least some slight improvement. In South Wales the position is practically unchanged; in North Wales employment is very irregular.Iron and Steel.The position in the Midlands and in Scotland is uncertain: the slight improve-ment recorded in the North of England has been maintained, and in Lancashire the situation is satisfactory at some centres.   There is little change to report in Wales.Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing.There is little material change to record in the situation given in the previous report. The Mersey is showing gradual improvement, and some prospects of activity in Scotland are apparent.Engineering.General engineering remains quiet except in the North of England, where activity, which may only be temporary, is reported. The improvement in the motor-engineering section continues in the Midlands and in the Home Counties.Textiles.Cotton. Unemployment among the Yorkshire cotton operatives is increasing. In Lancashire employment is irregular and the outlook is not good.Hosiery and Woollen and Worsted. The position in the Midlands remains normal. The decline in the West Riding of Yorkshire continues. Trade in Scotland is steady; the demand in certain sections being less brisk than formerly.Lace. No improvement is reported in the position in the Midlands.   There is some seasonal improvement in Devonshire,  but discharges are occurring in Somersetshire. Building.The slackness previously reported continues. Boot and Shoe.There is very little change to report in London and Northampton. Some orders have been received at Northampton, but slackness obtains at other centres in Northamptonshire. Although the slight improvement at Leicester continues, trade at Stafford is slack.
Clothing.The tailoring trade continues to suffer from seasonal depression.Chemicals, Pottery and Glass.The sheet-glass and the chemical industry continue good in Lancashire and Wales respectively. Further discharges have taken place in the pottery industry in the Midlands, and prospects of a recovery are remote. The Yorkshire glass bottle industry is depressed.Paper and Printing.In the South-Western Counties the paper trade is inactive. In Lancashire firms are subject to considerable intermittent working.Tinplate, Copper and Spelter.The Welsh tinplate industry continues to be fairly satisfactory, and while depression continues in the copper industry, some indications of a probable improvement are reported in the spelter trade.Patent Fuel.The decline in employment in this industry is continuing. Transport.There has been a slight temporary improvement at the London Docks and increased activity is reported at the Docks at Liverpool, Bootle, Salford and Preston.   At most of the South Wales Docks employment continues to be good.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.I.-DETAILED UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES.1. general Peecentage oe Unemployment.[Note.

[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee,The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &apos;&apos; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.[9202] b 2

Miscellaneous payments, refunds, &amp;e.(Up to April 1922, this is on the basis of 10 per cent, chargeable on the annual revenue under Section 12 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920 ; from April 1922, the maximum charge was increased to 12^ per cent, by the Act of April 1922, and the actual charge representing the total cost of administration has been 11 per cent.). 4.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 105,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922. the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the case of schemes assisted last year. All applications must, however, be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6). County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with, the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any 102,918,000 7,763,000 843,000111,524,00073,573,00037,951,000111,524,000
scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications may be received to the 13th January, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes.In December 1922, the Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 30tb November, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government will be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below : Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ... Land Drainage Afforestation ...Acceleration of Government contracts Office of Works    ... ... ... 375,000General Post Office   &apos;        ... ... 946,000-      1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.On the 12th December the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would puE in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, including Police Stations.SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN GREAT BRITAIN AT NOVEMBER 24, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.600,000 170,000 100,000Scheme.Number Employed in Greater London.Number Employed in Provinces.Total.1.

Up to the 30th November, 1922. grants had been sanctioned to a total of  2,799,192, but the full amount of the grant indicated will not be earned in every case. No fresh applications for grants of this nature are now considered, but work is still in progress on a few schemes originally approved for assistance on this basis. For the purposes only of such schemes grants may be sanctioned on the old basis to a date not later than the 31st December, 1922.(B.) Grants towards Loan Charges.(a.)
