Bryde fHouse of Lords. 3rd November. 191:2)19 The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest(Restrictions) Act, 1920, authorised jknter alia certain increases in the rents of certain ho uses 7&quot;*   It also prescribed the conditions subject to which the increases could be val idly charged by houeaownera.Section 3 (1) provides that &quot;nothing in this Act shall be taken to authorise any increase of. rent except in respect of a period during which, but for this Act, the landlord would be entitled to obtain possession&quot;.Another condition is set forth in Section 3 (2) which provides that &quot;notwithstanding any agreement to the contrarye where the rent of any dwelling house to which this Act ap lies is increased, no such increase shall be due or recoverable until or in respect of any period prior to the expiry of four clear weeks,, or, where such increase is on account of an increase in rates, one clear week, after the landlord has served upon the tenant a valid notice in writing of his intention to increase the rent, which notice shall be in the form contained in the first schedule to this Act, or in a form substantially to the same effect-*2. A difficult situation has arisen in regard tothe operation of this Act owing to the recent decision of the House of Lords in the case of Kerr v. Bryde as to the meaning and effect of Section 3 (1) above quoted.   Many houseowners in Scotland, especially in Glasgow and the West of Scotland, took the view that the statutory notice that the rent was to be increased was all that was necessary in order to entitle the owner to exact the permitted increases of rent,.     The Lords, however, by a majority of three to two have decided that in addition to the notice of increase it was necessary for the house-owner to serve on the tenant a formal notice of termination of the tenancy.     The effect of this decision is to render illegal all increases of rent in cases where a notice to terminate the tenancy has not been served, and the Act provides (Section 14) that payments obtained by a house-owner from a tenant in excess of those allowed by the Act may be recovered by the tenant or may be deducted by him from future rent payments.    Standing this decision, it will be open to many tenants in Scotland either to demand the payment from houseovmers of large sums paid in rent, or to set off these sums against future rent payments. The increases of rent in question have been running for nearly/
1 9  1 e) 0nearly two years.   Hates and imperial taxes in respect of these increases have been paid over to local authorities and to the Inland Revenue, and houseowners are now faced with the prospect of a demand for repayment which in many cases it will he difficult for repayment which in many cases it will be difficult or impossible for them to meet. An estimate of the total amount involved in Scotland cannot be given, but in Glasgow alone the City Assessor estimates that about  5,500,000 is at stake, made up as follows(1) Increases of rent................. 3,000,000.(2) Owners1 local rates..,........ *.....    500,000.(3) Occupiers&apos; local rates.............1,000,000.(4) Imperial taxes.....................1,000,000.The agent for the Glasgow Property Owners and House Factors&apos; Association reports that approximately, 75$ of the houses affected by the Increase of Rent, etc.. Act are owned by persons, usually small tradesmen, owning one, two or three tenements.    Some are owned by trustees acting under testamentary trusts.The Lord Provost and the Town Clerk of Glasgow were definitely of opinion that a considerable proportion of the owners affected were persons of small means or beneficiaries of small testamentary trusts and that financial ruin on a considerable scale might be expected if no legislative steps were taken to avert the consequences of the decision above mentioned.     This confirms the information derived from the Property owners and Factors&apos; Association.3. Apart from the serious consequences to house-owners who have been so unfortunate as to fail to observe a mere legal technicality, the situation is likely to cause considerable trouble to assessing authorities and may lead to litigation on an extended scale.4. Three courses seem open to the Government.     Thefirst is to leave the law as laid down in Kerr v. Bryde to operate.   The results of this course can be gathered from what is stated above.     The second is to legislate retrospectively so as to legalise increases of rent which have followed upon a statutory notice although no notice to terminate the tenancy has been served.     The legislation to be effective must obviously be retrospectivet for it is in the past that the difficulty lies.     In future, house-owners will have no difficulty in complying with, and no excuse for not complying with, the law as now declared. The third course is to legislate immediately on the lines of a moratorium suspending for a period of, say, six months, the right of tenants to recover the rent increases in question or to set them off against current rents.     This course would preserve the status quo until the Government has had time to consider the various questions arising under the Increase of Rent, etc., Act and is in a position to legislate not merely on the Kerr v. Bryde matter but comprehensively.The equities and necessities of the case seem to call for legislation, and it 1b suggested that the third course mi;.ht be the most defensible in all the circumstances. A draft Bill is attached.
1 o nI 0 iIt must be kept in view that a similar situation exists in England following on a judgment of the Court of Appeal to the same effect as the House of Lords decision. It ie understood, however, that the situation is not nearly so acute as it is in Scotland, but it seems probable that legislation as above suggested should apply to England also.FUTURE POLICY AS REGARDS THS ACT.The late Government set up a Departmental Committees &quot;to consider the operation of the Increase of Rent, etc,. Act, and to advise what steps should be taken to continue cr amend the Act&quot;.     The committee has issued an interim Report advising continuance subject to consideration of possible amendments.^ The Committee is still in being although its activities are meantime suspends3.     The Government will no doubt decide whether the Committee or a reconstituted Committee is to proceed with this inquiry, which would, if the proposed moratorium is adopted,cover the Kerr v. Bryde situation.&quot;CAVE&quot;. BKOVAR**.House of Lords.23rd November, 1922.
