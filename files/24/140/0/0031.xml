[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1922.SECRET.i- -CP. 4331.CABINET.SPECIAL  REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 79.     Period ended November 17, 1922.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 13th November was 1,377,153, an increase of 10,379 over the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.Coal-mining.Some improvement has been recorded in the Forest of Dean, and the outlook there is hopeful. Although the position in the Midlands and in Lancashire continues to be good, there is little change to report in the Yorkshire, Durham, Scottish and South Wales coalfields.   Depression continues in North Wales.Iron and Steel.While improvements in the North of England have been maintained, the situation in the Midlands is uncertain, and in Scotland discharges are occurring. In Wales there is no change.Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing.Slackness is the rule, but the outlook on the Tyne and Tees is a little brighter owing to the placing of a few orders.Engineering.There is no change to report except in the motor-engineering section, wherein some activity has occurred in consequence of the Motor Exhibition at Olympia.Textiles.Cotton. The spinning and manufacturing sections are experiencing considerable under-employment owing to curtailment of orders. The recent increase in the price of raw material is operating adversely.Hosiery and Woollen and Worsted.-Although trade is normal in the Midlands and brisk in Scotland, there is a steady decline in the West Riding of Yorkshire.Lace. Abnormal unemployment continues in Nottingham and Derbyshire, and prospects of a revival are reported to be remote.Building.Slackness is reported, unemployment among painters especially being very heavy.Boot and Shoe.The volume of unemployment continues to be relatively high in the chief centres in Northamptonshire, and there is no prospect of any immediate improvement. In Leicestershire employment is slightly better, but no material improvement is anticipated in the near future.
I. DETAILED UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES.1: General Percentage of Unemployment.[Note. Down to November 1920 the only percentages of unemployment available are those derived from Trade Dnion returns covering roughly 1,000,000 workers. From November 1920 percentages derived from the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, covering 11,000,000 to 12,000,000 workers, are also available.]end of 		Trade Union	Unemployment		Percentage.

The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union figures, was 4-7 per cent.  It was as high as 78 per cent in 1908 and 7-7 per cent in 1909.The tailoring trade is slack in the South-Western Counties, and short-time working is the rule.   Employment in the Lancashire hat-making trade has declined.Chemicals, Pottery and Glass.In Yorkshire the oil-milling industry shows some improvement. Although the glass-bottle trade is bad, there is a steady improvement reported in the plate and sheet-glass trade. The improvement previously recorded in the pottery industry has not been maintained.Tin-plate, Copper, Spelter.The Welsh tin-plate industry is making satisfactory progress, but there is no change to record in the copper and spelter trades.Patent Fuel.A heavy slump obtains owing principally to the high cost of production and the low price of coal during the summer.Transport.Work is scarce at the London Docks. At Liverpool employment is reported as fair.   At the South Wales Docks the position has improved.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.

SUMMARY OF ACTION; TAKEN.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.,[9142] b 2

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 102,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and, the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922. the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the case of schemes assisted last year. All applications must, however, be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are
shown below (see table 6). County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme.SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN GREAT BRITAIN AT NOVEMBER 10, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.Scheme.

Up to the 16th November, 1922, grants had been sanctioned to a total of
 2,801,957, but the full amount of the grant indicated will not be earned in every case. No fresh applications for grants of this nature are now considered, but work is still in progress on a few schemes originally approved for assistance on this basis.
