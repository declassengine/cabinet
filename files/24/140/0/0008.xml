THE FREEDOM OF THE STRAITS.I. Previous History of the Question.THE problem of the Straits has, during the last 150 years, been subjected to so much confusion of thought, and obscured by so many side issues, that it is to-day difficult to represent the question in its essential features. As an appendix to this paper will be found an historical summary prepared by the Historical Adviser to the Foreign Office, which is of great value in establishing the more permanent elements of the problem and as indicating the aspects from which it has at different times been approached. The following are the main points which emerge from the historical consideration of the Straits question: (a.) The problem of the Straits was from the first regarded, and in its essence remained, an Anglo-Russian rather than an Anglo-Turkish problem. Until 1915 Turkey was considered in this country to be quite subsidiary to the two main protagonists, and Russian ambitions to secure Constantinople (ambitions which were partly imperialistic, partly economic and partly religious), were opposed in this country primarily because their realisation would have implied an outlet for the Russian Black Sea fleet into the Mediterranean. It was thus that the term &quot; the Straits &quot; was invariably taken to cover not only the Dardanelles but also the Bosphorus. In the present paper it is in this sense that the expression &quot; the Straits &quot; is employed.(6.) Up till 1915 the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government was directed towards keeping the Russian Black Sea fleet out of the Mediterranean (&quot; the Closing of the Straits &quot;) rather than to enabling the British Mediter-ranean fleet to enter the Black Sea (&quot;the Freedom of the Straits &quot;). It is important, however, to recollect that these two policies were in their essence little more than two alternative forms of an identic defensive policy against Russia, and that British statesmen, even in the nineteenth century, sometimes hesitated whether their ultimate policy could best be secured by the closing or by the opening of the Straits to ships of war. Lord Palmerston is known to have consulted the Duke of Wellington on the subject, and the latter, after careful consideration, expressed the decided opinion that, as the Straits were nearer to the Russian naval bases than to our own, it would be preferable for them to be closed to the Russian fleet rather than that they should be open to the British fleet.(c.) This continual tendency throughout&apos; the nineteenth century to press for the closing rather than for the opening of the Straits is explained by a further important consideration. So long as Russia coveted the Straits, and Great Britain was opposed to the realisation of this ambition, it was inevitable that Turkey should look to us and France for protection in the event of a Russian attack. Under the Convention of 1841 the Sultan retained the right, if Turkey was at war, to allow foreign men-of-war to pass the Straits. It thus became almost an axiom during the nineteenth century that the Sultan would open the Dardanelles, and even the Bosphorus, to the British fleet in the event of any serious Russian menace. Thus, whereas the policy of the &quot;Closing of the Straits&quot; (as Lord Salisbury indicated in 1878), was inspired by the assumption that in the last resort Turkey, as in the Crimean War, would let us in ; &quot;the Freedom of the Straits &quot; is based on the realisation that now, as in 1915, she very probably will not.(d.) The Straits Convention of 1841, the Treaty of Paris of 1856 and the Treaty of London of 1871, all embodied in different forms the principle that foreign men-of-war should not have freedom of transit through the Straits; and His Majesty&apos;s Government were always careful to enforce,
or rather to maintain, this principle as against Russia. Thus, when during the Russo-Japanese War two vessels belonging to the Russian volunteer fleet passed through the Straits in the guise of merchant-men and proceeded to commit belligerent acts in the Red Sea, His Majesty&apos;s Government protested strongly, with the result that the commissions of these two vessels were revoked and reparation for their belligerent action was eventually made. (e.) With the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Convention in 1907, an entirely new situation was created. Turkey, for her part, realising that she could no longer count upon Great Britain to protect her against Russia, drew towards Germany; while Russia, as early as 1908. opened negotiations with Great Britain in the hope of securing some arrange-menfc as to egress from the Black Sea more in accordance with Russian desires. These conversations led to no definite result at the time, although Russia endeavoured during the years that followed to use her influence with her two partners in the Triple Entente to obtain an outlet into the Mediterranean. Her attempts to secure this object broke down against our determination that,.if the Straits were to be opened, this freedom should be reciprocal, and that Russia should not be allowed into the Mediterranean unless we were also allowed into the Black Sea. By 1912 we find M. Isvolsky, at that time Russian Ambassador in Paris, trying to persuade M. Poincare that it was in the interest of the two Western partners of the Entente to allow the. Russian fleet into the Mediterranean. M. Poincare appears to have agreed to this proposal and to have promised M. Isvolsky to &quot; support him with all his efforts.&quot; It was some one-sided solution of this nature which Russia had in mind in concluding in 1912 a naval agreement with Prance, and in proposing such an agreement two years later to ourselves.Although His Majesty&apos;s Government had thus adopted a cautious attitude towards Russia so long as she was no more than a co-partner in the Entente, yet we showed ourselves prepared generously to meet her wishes so soon as she became our ally in the European War. In March 1915 Notes were exchanged between the British and the Russian Governments, under which Russia was promised Constantinople, together with zones of surrounding territory on both sides both of the Bosphorous and of the Dardanelles corresponding roughly to the zones with which we are now so familiar. This agreement, in its turn, may be said to have lapsed owing to the conclusion of a separate peace between Russia and Germany, and Russia and Turkey.(/.) The position as regards Turkey was also fundamentally altered by the circumstances of the present war. On the one band Turkey, in the spirit at least if not in the letter, flagrantly violated the Straits Convention when on the 12th August, 1914, she allowed the &quot; Goeben &quot; and the &quot; Breslau &quot; to pass up the Dardanelles and to take refuge in the Golden Horn. The subsequent closing of the Straits, even to commerce, and the Gallipoli campaign convinced His Majesty&apos;s Government that the geographical position of Turkey placed in her hands an immense opportunity for obstruction, and induced them to decide that one of the objects of the war should be to remove this vital corridor from the control of so unreliable a Power.(g.) The doctrine of the &quot; Freedom of the Straits,&quot; as thus evolved, became, with the complete defeat of Turkey, a determination on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure that never again should the Sultan be able to bar the passage of the British fleet into the Black Sea. The occasion was singularly propitious for the realisation of this determina-tion. Turkey was powerless ; Russia was unable to make herself heard or felt; while the Allies were for the moment united. The Treaty of Sevres, while establishing the principle of free transit for warships both in peace and war, contained provisions which were calculated effectively to guarantee that this freedom of transit could not be interfered with. In the first place, the Dardanelles were, in practice, internationalised by Greece being left on one coast and Turkey on the other; in the second place, Turkey was demilitarised, both generally and locally, and 1161    [9094] b
the military control of the Bosphorus rested with the Allies. In the third place, elaborate provisions were enacted both for inspection and control; and in the last place, the Allied Powers, under the second paragraph of Article 36, reserved for themselves the right, in the event of Turkey failing to observe faithfully the provisions of the Treaty, to recede from their promise to leave Constantinople under Ottoman sovereignty.II. The present Position.Since the signature of the Treaty of Sevres the circumstances imder which that Treaty was drafted have been radically altered. Turkey has recovered:: Russia has again become a serious menace; and the Allied Powers have failed, on several important occasions, to maintain a united front. It will thus not only be almost impossible to obtain at the forthcoming Conference an agreement embodying our former solution of the Straits problem, but it would prove physically difficult to maintain or guarantee such a solution even if it could on paper be secured. Our difficulties in this respect are both diplomatic and military.(A.) Diplomatic Difficulties.Although Turkey, Russia and Prance have all pronounced themselves ready to accept in some form the &quot;Freedomof the Straits,&quot; yet the different interpretations given to this elastic formula by the several groups of Powers indicate that considerable divergence exists between our own interpretation and that of the other Powers.It may be well, at this stage, to outline the interpretations given by the several Governments to the formula of &quot; The Freedom of the Straits &quot; and to indicate the different reasons of policy which inspire these interpretations: 1. British Interpretation.The interpretation which His Majesty&apos;s Government placed on the phrase at the moment when they were drafting the Treaty of Sevres was undoubtedly that, whether Turkey was at peace or at war, there should be freedom of passage through the Straits not only for commercial vessels, but also for ships of war; in other words, our purpose was to secure by the terms of the Treaty that in no circumstances should Turkey obstruct the passage of the British fleet into the Black Sea.Our reasons for this were that in the event of a general war, Russia would either be on our side or against us. If she were our ally free communication with her would, as the last war showed, be essential. If, on the other hand, she were our enemy, the closing of the Straits would render her almost invulnerable, and would leave her free to treat the Black Sea as a Russian lake, to isolate Roumania and Bulgaria, and to use the valuable communications between Odessa and Batoum for the transport of troops to the Middle East.Apart from these primary considerations, the conflict appeared, and still remains, one between the continental, or military system, and the oceanic, or naval system. Put in another way, the issue was whether the Straits were to form a territorial bridge between Europe and Asia, or whether they were to con-stitute a blue water line separating those two continents. At,the present moment, France hopes to construct, on the bases of the elaborate connexus of alliances and combinations which have arisen in Eastern and Central Europe, a dominant position founded, in the final resort, on her own military prestige. If such countries as Bulgaria and Roumania, to say nothing of Turkey, are rendered immune either to pressure or assistance arising from command of the sea by some other Power (e.g., Great Britain), France will be able to exercise her influence with greater facility. It is hardly an exaggeration to state that if we are precluded from sending the British fleet into the Black Sea, if, that is, the mouths of the Danube flow into a permanent Russo-Turkish lake, the whole connexus of Danubian alliances and inter-dependencies which centre round the Little Entente will tend all the more to fall within the orbit either of France or Russia. The effect will be felt not only in Turkey, Bulgaria and Roumania, but even in Poland, Czecho-slovakia and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State. If, however, we can obtain the right of sending our fleet to Varna, Constanza and Odessa, whatever France may do for
these countries in the way of finance, propaganda and military support, British influence in the last resort will remain equal, if not predominant.The French realise this perfectly, and for this reason they have at times been tempted to oppose, as far as they can, our interpretation of the Freedom of the Straits.2. Other Interpretations of the Formula.(a.) Russia. -It is notoriously difficult to forecast the attitude which the Soviet Government will in any given circumstances be likely to adopt. Their main object for the present is to keep Turkey dependent as far as possible upon themselves. They will thus oppose any scheme which is calculated to render Turkey susceptible to pressure from the Western Powers and they will wish to keep her in full military possession of the Straits, with power to fortify them. They are unlikely, since their navy will always be weaker than ours, to support free transit of warships : and will probably endeavour to interpret the commercial freedom of the Straits merely as limiting our opportunities of blockade. Finally they will oppose any intervention on the part of the League of Nations.In any case they may be counted on to put the worst and the most public interpretation upon any formula in which we may try to embody on our desiderata.(b.) Turkey. Turkey has seldom found herself in so strong a position, both diplomatic and military, as she enjoys to-day. The Nationalist Government are extremely suspicious of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and are convinced that our intention is to secure some solution under which, in the ultimate resort, the British fleet can bombard Constantinople.They have committed themselves in vague terms to the commercial freedom of the Straits. They will endeavour to interpret this in such a, way as to throw upon Europe the expense of lighting and buoying the two waterways, while retaining for themselves complete military control both of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus.They will be found intractable, suspicious and very arrogant. It may be doubted whether they will consent to sign any treaty which does not leave the military control of the Straits entirely within their own hands.(c.j France. The French were some time ago not wholly in favour of the free passage of warships. On the one hand, they disliked our command of the sea, and desire therefore to prevent our ingress; on the other hand, they felt that in the event of a future war between France and Russia, it would be very inconvenient for them if the Russian fleet had an analagous right of egress into the Mediterranean. How far the campaign now being conducted by the Turks against all foreign commercial interests, will cause the French to reconsider their attitude, and induce them to join us in retaining some physical hold over the new Turkish Government must for the moment remain a matter of conjecture. All that can be said is that the attitude of the French to-day is already very different from the whole-hearted Turcophil policy which was theirs six weeks ago.(d.) Italy. -The former Italian Government tended generally to support France, to conciliate Turkey and to limit our opportunities of exercising naval power. It is possible that M. Mussolini may be prepared to adopt a more energetic and less subservient policy.(e.) Boumania, who has a very direct interest in the Freedom of the Straits, will be anxious to agree with our point of view, but is within the orbit of France and at the mercy of Russia.(f.) Jugoslavia is not wholly to be relied upon for any useful action; but might be willing to support our policy provided France were also in agreement.(g.) Greece, provided she does not dissolve into anarchy, can be counted on.(h.) Bulgaria will probably confine her efforts to obtaining an outlet to the ^aegean and will not take any very active interest in the transit of war vessels through the Straits.(B.) Military or Physical Difficulties.It will be seen from the above that we may be faced at the Conference with serious opposition, of which the nucleus would be formed by Turkey and Russia, on the one hand, and possibly by France and Italy on the other, who may in &apos; different ways and for different reasons oppose our desire to secure the free passage of men-of-war. The United States may possibly support our contention, but it is unlikely that, in their capacity of &quot; observers &quot; at the Conference, they wish to take any very active part in the controversy.[9094] c
Even, however, if we obtain a general agreement to the effect that the principle of the free passage of warships should be reaffirmed in the new treaty,, it will now be difficult to devise and maintain physical guarantees and safeguards for the maintenance of that principle. The free passage of warships both in peace and war could be absolutely guaranteed only by the presence on the spot of forces able effectively to resist not only the total forces of Turkey, but the total of such forces plus any potential Turkish ally. This could only be secured by clauses similar to those of the Treaty of Sevres, and it is obvious that we are not to-day in a position, unless we again go to war, to impose such extensive servitudes upon Turkey. On the other hand, anything short of the full scheme of control as embodied in the Treaty of Sevres might, when put to the test, be found to be illusory. All schemes for the control of the Straits by reduced Allied detachments, -or by some military organisation under the League of Nations, would be likely, in practice, to prove irksome, expensive and, in the ultimate resort, ineffective.Before examining the alternative lines of policy which are now open to us, it is important to indicate that the present disadvantage under which we labour, both diplomatic and military, is not likely to be very permanent. In other words the present moment is for us, of all historical moments, the most inopportune for an international conference on the Straits question ; in a few weeks conditions may be more favourable; to-day they are very inauspicious indeed.Inconvenient as is the present arrogance and power of Turkey, it must be realised that it is largely fortuitous and provisional. It is based on an unnatural alliance with Russia; it has maintained itself owing to the disunity and war-weariness of Europe. Both these phenomena will pass in time and Turkey, galvanised though she now is into unnatural energy, will sooner or later relax again into her hereditary weakness.It must be remembered also that Turkey knows neither gratitude nor resent-ment; her only consistent political emotion is fear. For a century she was afraid of Russia and made friends with us and France; when we in our turn made friends with Russia, Turkey sought refuge with Germany; now that she is afraid of us she is espousing France and Russia. It is probable that in a few years she will be afraid again of Russia and will turn again to Great Britain. Thus before long some readjustment of the present unfavourable balance is probable, and as soon as this has taken place Turkey will be easier to deal with.Moreover, Russia, dangerous as she now is, has become dangerous chiefly from her position of having everything to gain and nothing to lose. This condition in its turn can only be transitory, but while it lasts it renders it in practice impossible to negotiate on a basis of reasonable equality with the Soviet Government.The Near Eastern question will not be permanently settled by any arrange-ments which may be made at this Conference. It will only be settled when Russia and Turkey have assumed their natural, and lost their present abnormal, proportions.It is submitted therefore that our object should be to secure a settlement which, while enabling a,n early peace to be signed and ratified, will not unduly tie our hands in the future or leave us in regard to the Straits in a position less favourable than that which existed before the war ? How can such a settlement be secured ?III.-Alternative Lines of Policy. We are thus faced by the following proposition: 1. Our policy at the time of the Treaty of Sevres was to secure and guarantee the freedom of passage, whether Turkey was at war or peace, not only for commerce but also for ships of war. -2. This freedom of passage can only be absolutely secured by a system of physical guarantees which, to be effective, should not be less than thoseembodied in the Treaty of Sevres.
3. Diplomatically it will be difficult to secure the acceptance of the principle ..&apos; of the passage of warships; militarily it will be difficult in present conditions to safeguard the principle even if it were accepted. 4. Some modification of our original policy may therefore be imposed upon us. What form should be given to such modification if found inevitable ?Only six weeks ago it appeared probable that His Majesty&apos;s Government would stand practically alone in contending that any real restriction should be imposed upon Turkey&apos;s full military control over the Straits. Our two major Allies did not seem disposed to agree to anything beyond vague paper guarantees under the League of Nations; and it was apprehended that, unless we were prepared to act alone against Turkey, we might be forced completely to abandon our maximum programme and to fall back on interpreting the &quot;Freedom of the Straits&quot; as applying to commerce only.Since then certain developments have taken place, which indicate that our original pessimism may in some respects be relieved. The Turks have behaved in such a way as to alarm, and even to alienate, important sections of French public opinion. The Fascista revolution has placed the Government of Italy in the hands of a man who is certainly more energetic than his predecessors, and may prove more reliable. There are signs to-day that Allied unity may again become a deciding factor.An important indication of this improvement in the general situation is furnished by the conversations which took place on the 9th November between Marshal Foch and General Burnett-Stuart, Director of Military Operations and Intelligence. In these conversations, and in the memorandum which he subsequently prepared, the Marshal made it clear that he, at least, was not of the opinion. that the Allies should leave the Turks in unfettered control of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus ; and that the &quot; Freedom of the Straits &quot; was a principle which it was &quot; absolutely indispensable&quot; that the Allies should maintain &quot; under penalty of losing one of the principal fruits of the war.&quot;This statement of Marshal Foch must, it is true, be qualified by certain reservations, namely : (a.) That the Marshal is supposed to be somewhat indifferent to the Near Eastern situation, and that his opinion on this question is likely to carry less weight with the French Government than would his views on the affairs of Central Europe;(&amp;.-) That, as he himself confessed, he had no clear idea of what was meant by the &quot; Freedom of the Straits.&quot; We have nothing definite to prove that lie considers this phrase necessarily to imply the free passage of ships of war;(c.) That the French Government may be unwilling to go so far as to make the acceptance by Turkey of the Freedom of the Straits, in the sense advocated by Marshal Foch, a condition sine qua non of signing the Treaty of Peace.It thus remains uncertain whether the French Government will adopt as their own the proposal which the French Marshal has expounded; whether the Marshal himself agrees with our own view regarding the passage of war-ships; or whether, if the Turks reject Marshal Fooh&apos;s proposal, M. Poincare will give us any very effective support in imposing the scheme upon them. All we can now say is that the Marshal has decisively expressed his view that the Turks should not be left in a position which will enable them systematically to fortify the Straits.We may summarise as follows the three main alternatives which are Open to us : 1. Marshal Foch&apos;s Proposal.The outlines of Marshal Foch&apos;s scheme are as follows:- (a.) Demilitarisation of the Straits zones, with destruction of all military and naval works.(&amp;,) No Turkish  armed forces, with the exception of the Constantinople garrison, to have access to these zones. [9094] d
(c.) Inspection (or, in French, &quot;controle&quot;) by a Commission, under the auspices of the League, and composed of interested Powers, to secure that this demilitarisation is being observed.(d.) No Allied occupation or garrison at any point.(e.) Limitation of the armed forces which Turkey may maintain in Eastern Thrace.Assuming, as we are bound to assume, that we are to-day not in a position to impose such absolute guarantees upon Turkey as were envisaged in the Treaty of Sevres, this modified proposal of Marshal Poch offers important-tant advantages : 1. Although it would not in the ultimate resort make it impossible for the Turks to attempt to close the Straits, yet it will render it difficult for them to erect any systematic fortifications.2. In the event of war there would thus be more likelihood of our being able to rush the Straits than there would be if the Turks, in times of peace, had remained in unfettered and unwatched control.3. Even, therefore, if we do not obtain specific recognition of the right of free navigation of the Straits by warships, we should, if Marshal Poch&apos;s proposal were accepted, place ourselves, under the new Treaty of Peace, in a more advantageous position than we were in 1914.In the absence, so far, of any assurance that M. Poincare, even if he agrees to accept the scheme as a joint Allied desideratum, he will be willing to impose it upon the Turks, we ought, unless we are prepared to deal with Turkey single-handed, to have ready certain alternatives to which, if need be, we can returned^eat : 2. Interposition of the League of Nations.If M. Poincare hesitates to accept Marshal Poch&apos;s scheme, or if, as is more likely, he accepts it subject to the reservation that he will not pledge himself to enforce it, we may find it desirable to retire to our second line and invite the co-operation of the League of Nations.If we contemplate reference to the League of Nations We must be prepared to face certain initial difficulties  (a.) In the first place, neither Russia nor Turkey are members of the League,and are therefore unlikely to bind themselves in advance to acceptwhatever measures the League may prescribe. (&amp;.) In the second place, the League itself may object to having imposed upon it any detailed programme such as might be included in a treaty to be adhered to both by Russia and by Turkey.In other words, if we make the terms of reference too general, they will be objected to by Russia and Turkey; and if we make them too precise, they may not be well received by the League.It should be possible to conceive some middle course which, while not alienating Russia and Turkey, would render possible the co-operation of the League. Such a course, as regards details, would doubtless base itself upon such established principles as the Danube and Suez Canal Conventions, and would meet the legitimate anxieties of the League by confining the activities and responsi-bilities of their representative to functions of inspection rather than to functions of control.The idea would be to elaborate some &quot; Statute of the Straits &quot; which, while providing for such necessities as lighting, buoyage and sanitary control, would, at the same time, maintain the semblance of Turkish sovereignty.The Department have prepared, in detailed form, alternative treaty articles by which this supervision of the League could be exercised. These articles are not annexed to this memorandum, but they, as well as several other draft alternatives, are immediately available if desired. Those articles which provide for the inter-vention of the League are based on the conviction that if the League has to be introduced, it should be represented in the person of an individual High Commis-sioner rather than in the form of a mixed Commission. If the Allies are unable themselves to establish physical force in the zone of the Straits, they must rely upon some other broad-based moral force working through an individual. The combination of the extremes of moral appeal and personal efficiency can only be
achieved through the appointment of a League High Commissioner who should, if possible, be a citizen of the United States.The powers and functions of such a High Commissioner would not extend very far beyond the inspection of the demilitarised zone envisaged by Marshal Foch. The disadvantage of the interposition of the League would be, however, that in the event of the Turks disregarding the warnings of the High Commis-sioner, the League would be unable to exert rapid physical pressure. The Turks, who have no regard for anything but physical force, might thus feel that they could continually defy the League with impunity.If we are unable to secure either some inter-Allied organ of inspection as proposed by Marshal Foch, or the appointment of an American High Commissioner under the League of Nations, we may be obliged to fall back upon our last line of retreat, namely, the commercial freedom of the Straits : 3. The Commercial Freedom of the Straits.To the principle of the commercial freedom of the Straits France, Italy, Russia and Turkey are all committed; the discussion will arise, not on the principle, but on the interpretation to be given to it. Here again a maximum and minimum interpretation can be applied.(1.) Maximum Interpretation.(a.) So long as Turkey was at peace the Straits have always been free to commerce. &quot;What is required is some convention such as will secure unimpeded freedom of commercial navigation even when Turkey is at war.(6.) During the Tripoli and Balkan wars the passage was blocked by Turkish mines for long periods and free navigation was seriously obstructed; during the European war the Straits were closed completely. Measures must now be taken to secure that this shall not happen again.(c.) Events have shown that Turkey if left in complete physical control of the Straits cannot be trusted.[d.) Some international convention must therefore be made such as will provide that in no circumstances shall Turkey be in a position to close the Straits to commerce.This interpretation would thus imply the imposition upon Turkey of physical guarantees varying from a promise on paper that no military works would be established, to the institution of controls of the nature contemplated in the Treaty of Sevres. The difficulty of this is, not only the old difficulty of maintaining physical guarantees, but also the danger that the Turks will claim that if they are to be deprived of all physical defences they must be guaranteed against attack by the permanent neutralisation, on the Belgian analogy, of the Straits and adjoining territories. This contention would be difficult to counter, and, if accepted, would leave us in a position less favourable than that which existed before the war.(2.) Minimum Interpretation.The minimum interpretation would be to regard the Straits merely as an &quot;international&quot; water-way, and to prescribe measures for the freedom of navigation on the analogy of those embodied in the Danube Convention. Such measures would apply only to conservancy, quarantine, buoyage and lighting, and, so long as they and the Russians were represented, the Turks would have no objection to the execution and supervision of these functions being entrusted to an international commission. &apos; To apply the Danube Convention to the Straits would, it must be admitted, in practice represent but a slight improvement of the pre-war situation, since it would merely regularise the details of navigation during peace. It would not in any effective way solve the problem of free navigation when Turkey is at war. The solution implied in the &quot; commercial freedom of the Straits&quot; is not therefore a solution at all. It should only be adopted if it is found that no other alternative can be secured.
Conclusions. -The following, therefore, are the conclusions arrived at: 1. That we should in the first instance endeavour to secure the acceptance by France and Italy of Marshal Foch&apos;s proposal, to be interpreted, if possible, as covering the Freedom of the Straits to navigation by warships.2. That if allied unity cannot be obtained on this proposal, or if, although agreed in principle, our Allies refuse to exert any real pressure to secure Turkish acceptance, we can fall back upon the interposition of the League of Nations.3.. If defeated on both of the two above propositions we must endeavour to secure the formulation in the eventual Treaty of Peace of the doctrine of the commercial Freedom of the Straits in such a form as, while in no way tying our hands for the future, would impose upon Turkey some measure, if not of international control, at least of international inspection.HAROLD G. NICOLSON.Foreign Office, November 15, 1922.
CONFIDENTIAL.Appendix.INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO THE MEMORANDUM ON THE BLACK SEA, THE BOSPHORUS AND THE DARDANELLES.THE following memorandum contains a succinct account of international action as to the Dardanelles and the Bbsphorus. It seems necessary to supplement the narrative by calling attention to certain general points which arise out of it.1. We may begin with a question of terminology. In the past we find that the question which the Government had to consider was always that of &quot; opening &quot; or closing &quot; the Straits; quite recently, however, a practice has arisen of speaking of the &quot; freedom of the Straits.&quot; The difference in language implies a fundamental difference in principle. The older usage was based on the recognition that as in fact the Straits are a narrow channel, both shores of which were within the territories of a single State, that State in law and fact, by universal agreement, exercises full and complete sovereignty over the waterway just in the same way as a country controls the mouth of a river which runs through its own territory. Other countries there-fore had no &quot; rights &quot; of any kind except such privileges as the Porte chose by treaty to accord to them. This is the doctrine to which all European Governments, and in. particular the British Government, have always given their adherence. The political problem was always to persuade the Porte, whether by amicable discussion, by bribery, intimidation or force, as to the manner in which it would exercise its undoubted rights of sovereignty.2. As soon as we use the words &quot; freedom of the Straits,&quot; we are, though perhaps not always with full consciousness and deliberation, committing ourselves to a different principle. Some writers on international law are inclined to approach the problem by laying down the general principle that the high seas are and must be freely open to the navigation of the ships of all nations, whether mercantile or naval; they then proceed to state dogmatically that not only the Black Sea, but also the Straits, are parts of the high seas, that therefore navigation im them should be unrestricted and that their waters are not, and cannot be subject to the territorial sovereignty of Turkey or of any other State. The Government of Washington, which has never been a party to the Straits Conventions, seems to have been disposed to adopt this point of view, and has avoided full recognition of the Turkish claims to sovereignty (see g 28).- If this point of view were adopted, then the work of the future would be, not as in the past, to influence the Porte as to the manner in which it exercises its undoubted rights of sovereignty, but to devise guarantees to prevent it or any other Government attempting illegally to establish control over the waterway.3. Those who advocate this newer view naturally lay stress on the analogy of the Baltic and argue that the Black Sea should be placed in the same category as the Baltic, to which there has always been free access. In some ways the conditions are very similar. Of the entrances to the Baltic, two, the Sound at one spot, and the Little Belt for a considerable distance, are less than 6 miles broad, so that according to the English doctrine referred to by Lord Palmerston 21) they would both come within the territorial jurisdiction of the riverain States. And even if the Great Belt is in no place less than 10 miles broad, we have to remember that there has apparently never been a general agreement as to the 3-mile limit for territorial jurisdiction and the Danish Government have always claimed, and apparently still claim, that the waters both of the Sound, the Great and the Little Belt are within their territorial jurisdiction, and for some centuries used their authority to impose dues, on all vessels passing the Sound. The real difference between the two is, however, not legal and theoretical, but historical. There has never been any attempt, except for very limited periods, to close the Sound! and Great Belt, whether to merchant vessels or to ships of war. When a proposal has been made to declare the Bialtic a &quot; closed sea,&quot; it has always been defeated. However great the resemblance may be to the lawyer, the historian and the practical politician cannot ignore the fact that the two seas and the two Straits have been for 500 years treated on completely different principles.4. The question then arises whether during recent years there has been such a general change as to justify or require the British Government to repudiate all its7149-1   [9061a]
past declarations, and apply to the Straits some such general abstract principle. Here we come across an important distinction between ships of commerce and ships of war. As to the first, as far back as 1856, the general principle of free access to the Black Sea was, in fact, adopted in the Treaty of Paris; and also the rules governing international communications in times of peace have in recent years been greatly developed. These regulations have been applied to rivers such as the Danube, and. means have been found by which they can be put in force without infringing the principle of territorial sovereignty. Everything that can be done for a river might also obviously be done for the Straits, which in many ways have the character rather of a river than a sea. In regard, therefore, to commercial navigation, we appear to have reached a stage at which the transit of the Straits by commercial vessels in time of peace can be formally placed under international regulations; and, if so, we can properly speak of the &quot; freedom of the Straits.&apos;&apos;5. For the application of such rules either to commercial traffic during time of war or to the passage of warships, both during peace and during war, the historical method gives no guidance. There is no experience in the past to help us. Many have suggested that the rules governing the navigation of the Suez Canal might be applied to the Straits. For the reasons given below 43), to which others might be added, it seems very doubtful whether the analogy holds. Not does it seem that much help can be got from the treatment of other Straits, as, for instance, those of Mlegallan, for whatever similarity there might be if we approached the problem from the point of view of a theoretical lawyer, the political and practical difficulties are such as to overpower the resemblance. It may, however, be worth while noting that supposing the principle that the Straits, being part of the seas, were and must remain open, the same principle would apparently have to be applied to the Sea of d&apos;azof.6. All proposals for establishing the freedom of the Straits in this sense neces-sarily imply an international guarantee; to which, of course, this country would be a partner, for the security of Constantinople against an attack by sea, and also a general undertaking to be observed even in time of war to refrain from the military occupation and fortification of either bank of the Straits. The only experience which history affords of guarantees of this nature seems to be the neutrality of Switzerland and of Belgium; there are probably few countries who, even since the establishment of the League of Nations, would be willing to depend for their security on the certainty that such guarantees and engagements would not be violated or ignored. This was clearly the opinion of the Russian Government. From 1912 onwards it seems that vague suggestions in this direction were put forward, though I have not been able to find any positive and considered proposals, but Russia would not accept guarantees of this kind, and there are obvious objections to making promises which it would be very difficult to fulfil in the stress of war. If the case of the Suez Canal is quoted, it must be pointed out that, in fact, the convention has never been submitted to the real stress of warfare. A perusal of the confidential papers at the time when it was under negotiation supplies evidence that, even in this country, the military advisers of the Crown did not believe that any paper convention would be sufficient to deter an interested party from using every means at their disposal to make naviga-tion through the canal impossible; this doubt extended even to our own action. A guarantee to be effective requires armed force; in the case of a matter of such importance as the Straits, this must be not only adequate in size, but also ready for use at any time to meet an immediate emergency. This was foreseen in the Treaty of Sevres; under that instrument the security for keeping the Straits open was the right-given to Great Britain, France and Italy to maintain naval&apos; and military forces there. It may be assumed that neither Turkey nor Russia would be willing now to accept a system which would place access to Constantinople and the Black Sea in the hands of their late enemy.What it seems to come to is that it would be extraordinarily difficult for the British Government to repudiate all its action in the past and adopt the principle of freedom and attempt to impose it upon other States. It would, of course, be easy enough for a completely new Government such as that which we now have in Russia to do so, and if they were (which does not seem probable) to press the principle, it would be much easier for the British Government to accept their suggestion than it would be to take the initiative.7. The difficulty would also be removed if there had been a complete change in the political conditions; if, for instance, there had been such a modification of the frontiers&apos;that the Porte should cease to be the sovereign Power over both banks either of the Bosphorus, or of the Dardanelles, or of both, a change such as the Treaty of Sevres, had it been ratified, would have brought about.   Or,, again, the difficulties
would have been removed if Turkey, instead of becoming again, as it was in the past, a fully sovereign State, were in some form or another to be placed under some form of curatel or guardianship; if her territory were to be neutralised or guaranteed, or if she were placed under a mandate of a single Power, or became a protected State.8. At the present moment it looks as though none of these conditions would be fulfilled; both shores of the Straits will apparently be restored to Turkey with full sovereignty. From this important practical results will follow. At this moment both shores of the Straits are, as they have always been in the past, legally part of the Turkish dominions. They happen at the moment still to be in the military occupation of enemy States, but this military occupation by itself no more affects the permanent legal position than did the military occupation of the North of France or of Belgium by the Germans. As soon as peace is made, this military occupation will presumably cease; full and complete Turkish sovereignty will be re-established, and will be subject only to such restrictions or to such new rules as the Turkish Government may agree to by treaties with one or more of the other States of Europe. If no such agreements are arrived at, either the existing treaties will once more come into operation (they can only be repealed by unanimous consent), or, alternatively, matters will revert to the condition which existed before the Straits Convention of 1841; the sovereignty of the Porte would be unrestricted and the Turkish Govern-ment would be free to open or close the Straits to the war vessels of other nations as they themselves wished.9. In either case we should find ourselves back again in a diplomatic situation identical with that which existed before the war. The different nations, each pursuing the policy which seemed advantageous to itself, would try each to gain its ends by bringing pressure to bear upon the Turks. This being so, a study of the past history of the problem is not without its value. We see from this that the question is primarily and always must be Russian rather than English or French. It all turns on the constant efforts of the Russian Empire to gain secure access to the open sea by a channel completely under their own control. This continues, and must continue. The overthrow of the autocracy cannot change it; the policy of the new Government of Russia must eventually become a continuation of that of its predecessors, just in the same, way as the policy of the French Republic continued that of the monarchy. Whatever the future may have in store, to the country which controls the northern shore of the Bai**e, the question of the Straits will always be of predominant importance. At this moment it is more important than ever in the past, for Russia has to a large extent lost the alternative openings through the independence of the Baltic States and the extension of Japanese influence in Eastern Siberia. For the British Government the political problem has always turned on the point, Which is more important, the defensive, i.e., the exclusion of the Russians from the Mediterranean, or the offensive, the entrance of the British fleet into the Black Sea ? The first seems to be almost purely one of naval strategy; in the second larger political problems are involved, as, for instance, the defence of India by a naval attack on Russia, as in the time of the Crimea, and the importance of being able to use the navy in order to.support British interests in the countries bordering on the Black Sea on the one side Roumania, and indirectly the Danubian States and Poland, for to Poland, though it is not a riverain country, the exit by the Black Sea is of high importance; on the other side, the districts of the Caucasus, Batoum, Baku and the gate to the Caspian and Northern Persia.J.

CONFIDENTIAL.THE BLACK SEA, THE BOSPHORUS AND THE DARDANELLES. .An Historical Sketch.(l)Unrestricted Turkish Sovereignty.In order to understand the problem of the Straits, even in its most modern form, it is necessary to start from the condition of things which existed when the Turkish Empire was at the height of its power. During the 17th century, not only were the shores of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, with the Sea of Marmora, but also the whole coast of the Black Sea, within the territory of the Ottoman Empire. Both the waterway of the Straits and the Black Sea were therefore treated as part of the Ottoman Dominions; the Straits were regarded as fully and completely under the authority of the Porte, as if they had been not the sea but a river. The right of the Sultan to determine absolutely by his own will whether, and under what conditions, ships flying a foreign flag, whether mercantile or naval, should enter the Straits, was as full and unimpeached as at the present day is the right of the Dominion of Canada to control the waters of the St. Lawrence, or of England to control the mouth of the Thames or the Solent. This right has continued up to the present day, subject only to such changes in the exercise of it as the Government of Constantinople might agree to in treaties with one or more foreign States, and if the Turkish sovereignty were restored without conditions this right would revert to them, not indeed for the Black Sea, but for the Straits.2. Down to the beginning of the 18th century the practice of the Porte was absolutely to deny entrance into the Black Sea to the ships of any nation whatsoever. &quot; For 300 years from 1476 to 1774 they alone navigated and traded in the Black Sea, and they used it as their own domain.&quot; Under the Capitulations by which the right of commerce in the Levant was regulated, the Porte granted to Venice, France, Great Britain and other States, permission for merchant vessels flying their flag to sail through the Dardanelles up to the port of Constantinople, but under no circumstances and no conditions were they ever allowed to proceed through the Bosphorus. From time to time permission was given to merchants to trade, but never for foreign ships to sail in these waters. Cargoes for Black Sea ports had to be transhipped to Turkish vessels, and in the same way ships navigating the lower waters of the Danube had to tranship their cargoes, and were not allowed themselves to navigate the Euxine. At this period! there was no idea of anything such as a right of way through the Straits into the Black Sea,Russia and the Black Sea.3. A change came when the Russians began to establish themselves on the northern shores of the Black Sea, In the year 1696 the town of d&apos;azof on the Sea of d&apos;azof was captured by the Russian army, and in the year 1700 a Russian mission was sent to Constantinople to demand the opening of the Black Sea to Russian commerce. This mission arrived at Constantinople on a Russian ship of war. This fact created the greatest concern at the Porte. They believed, and acted on the belief, that if a Russian navy were established in the Black Sea, the security of Constantinople would be fatally compromised : &quot; The Sultan considers the Black Sea as his own house to which strangers cannot penetrate; it is a virgin shut up in the harem, hidden from the view of strangers, and he would rather have war than permit other nations to navigate on this internal sea.&quot;(!) The authorities which I have used are first the archives of the Foreign Office, and in particular a series of valuable memoranda prepared from time to time in the Library regarding- the action of the British Government. It is from these memoranda that many of the quotations in the text are taken Of published works the most important are &quot; La Mer Noire: Essai d&apos;Hisfoire diplomatiMue&quot; (I do not know who the author is) : &quot; Le Bosphore et les Dardanelles,&quot; by Goriainof; the only English monograph on the subject is &quot; The Question of the Bosphorous and Dardanelles,&quot; by PhUlipson and Buxton, w Inch is of very unequal merit.In case the length of this memorandum may be the subject of criticism, I may be allowed to point out that the last full memorandum written in the Foreign Office by Sir Edward ITertslet extended to 120 printed folio pages, and this stops at 1877.1149    [9061] b
And again : &quot; When foreign ships obtain the right of sailing freely on this sea, the end of the Ottoman Empire will have sounded.&quot;The request was refused, and for the next seventy years the relations between the two States were governed by this controversy, which was the cause of prolonged wars. During the reign of Catherine II (1762-1796), the Russians succeeded in-establishing themselves along the whole northern shore of the Black Sea, eventually annexing the territory of the Crim Tartars, and by the Treaty of Kioutchouk--Kainardji (1774) the Porte conceded to them the right to the free and uninterrupted navigation of all the seas which water their States. Their commercial vessels were thereby permitted not only to use the Black Sea, but also to pass through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. This treaty was amplified and: confirmed by further treaties, as in 1779 and 1783. But in all these treaties the authority of the Porte was maintained by strict regulations as to the size and nature of the vessels which might pass the Straits; in every case they were required to receive a special firman, and the Porte retained the right of search to assure itself that there were no Ottoman subjects on board.Opening of the Straits and Black Sea to Commerce.4. In this way the Russians had gained! not only the sole right to navigate the Black Sea, but also* other valuable privileges, for instance, their ships were exempted from the dues which English and French merchant vessels had to pay on passing the Dardanelles. Inevitably the Porte was, though slowly and with reluctance, compelled to grant similar privileges to other States, as to Austria in 1784, to Great Britain in 1799, to France in 1802, to Prussia in 1806.The further history of merchant shipping need not detain us long. By the Treaty of Bucharest between Russia and Turkey in 1812, all previous treaties were renewed and confirmed. At this date the right of navigation was still a special privilege accorded to a few Powers : -&quot; In 1822 the Ottoman Minister communicated to the Ministers of the Powers whose flags had the right of entrance to the Black Sea a firman of the Grand Seigneur from the date of which the passage of the Bosphorus is closed to the ships of nations to whom the Porte has never accorded the right of entry to that sea. These Powers are requested not to lend their flag to facilitate the passage. Many Sardinian and Spanish vessels, both laden and empty, have been seized in a port of this capital since this order.&quot;It was extended to Sardinia in 1823, to Sweden and Spain in 1827. A great extension was given to the privilege by the Treaty of Adrianople, concluded between Russia and Turkey in 1829 at the conclusion of the war; by this Russian ships were to be free from any kind of visit whatever on the part of the Ottoman authorities, and it is particularly to be noted that the privileges granted to Russian ships were extended also to the ships of friendly nations trading with Russian ports : &quot; The Sublime Porte promises never to allow itself henceforth to stop or detain vessels laden or in ballast, whether Russian or belonging to nations with whom the Ottoman port should not be in a state of declared war, which vessels shall be passing through the Strait of Constantinople and that of the Dardanelles oh their way from the Black Sea into the Mediterranean, or from the Mediterranean into the Russian ports of the Black Sea.&quot;It will be seen, then, that this treaty in reality throws open the Straits to the free navigation of all nations, and its provisions were reinforced by a series of treaties by which the different civilised States were in this matter placed on the most-favoured-nation footing. As an example of them we may refer to the treaty with the United States of 1830.(2)5. From this time both the Straits and the Black Sea have in times of peace been in fact open to the commerce of all nations; and a clause in the Treaty of Paris (1856) establishes the principle for the Black Sea : -&quot;Freed from any impediment, the commerce in the ports and waters of the Black Sea shall be subject only to regulations of health, customs and police, framed in a spirit favourable to the development of commercial transactions.&apos;&apos;(s) See Turkey No. 16 (1878), Cmmd. 1953, which contains the text of the more important treaties.
No such general regulation has been made for the Straits, and down to 1914 the right even to commercial navigation through them seems to have depended solely on. the individual treaties referred to above. Apart from the permission given by them, the full sovereignty of the Porte continued, and it has always maintained the formality of the separate firman for each vessel which had to be granted on passing the Dardanelles, and continued to make restrictions, as, for instance, that ships might not pass during the night. On these matters there has been frequent correspondence, but it does not appear that any general questions of principle were raised. The only matter concerning merchant shipping on which there still is difficulty is the procedure in the case of war. Difficult questions as to the right of blockade have arisen, and both in 1.912 and 1913, though the Straits were not formally closed, serious actual impediments were put in the way of shipping, as, for instance, by mining the channel; they led to protests by the interested States, and at one time active intervention by Russia, who was acting in close agreement with Roumania, appeared imminent. The consideration of this point of navigation in war does not seem to belong to an historical memorandum, but rather is a question of current international law.Constantinople and the Partition of Turkey.6. Very different is it with the opening of the Straits to ships of war; this is a problem of a completely different order. In it were involved points such as the security of Constantinople, use of the Straits as the base for a Russian fleet in the Mediterranean, which might become a clanger equally to France and Great Britain, and the opening of the Black Sea to the maritime Powers for hostile operations against Russia. While essentially a question of naval strategy, it was for more than a hundred years to be one of the pivots on which the policy of the great Powers depended. More and more Turkey herself became merely a pawn in the game; the protagonists were Russia, Austria and the two maritime Powrers, France and England, but always in order to understand it, we must accustom ourselves to look at it primarily from the Russian point of view.7. The Russians, as we have seen, before the end of the 18th century, had attained free passage of the Straits for their own merchant shipping; they were well aware, however, that this privilege was a precarious one; it had been conceded under pressure and might at any time be revoked if the Porte came under the influence of other States. It could only be permanently secured if the Russians themselves exercised actual control over the Straits. The attainment of this control was therefore always the ultimate object of their policy. The simplest Avay of obtaining it would be by war, conquest and annexation, and Catherine II, throughout her reign, sedulously encouraged the national and religious aspiration of the Russian nation that it was their mission to be the liberator of the Orthodox Church, to rescue Constantinople from the infidels and to re-establish the Christian Empire of the East. But Turkey did not stand alone. They were well aware that the other nations of Europe, and especially Austria, France and Great Britain, would not permit so great an extension of Russian power. If Turkey was to be overthrown, then it would have to be dealt with like Poland; there must be a partition; and projects of the partition of Turkey were frequent. In 1789 we find the idea of a coalition between Russia, France and Austria, a coalition from which Great Britain was to be excluded. In this, as in every other similar project, Constantinople and the Straits were to be assigned to Russia, Egypt to France. In view of later events, we must never forget that Egypt and the Straits were always connected; the fate of the one was to depend on the fate of the other. The realisation of any of these projects implied an attempt to exclude the English altogether from the Mediterranean, for, after all, were they not interlopers there ?8. We can easily understand then how it came about that Pitt laid down the principle that the maintenance of the Turkish Empire was a British interest. He was thinking of the defence of India and the maintenance of British sea power in the Levant. This was threatened by the Russians, who at this time maintained a considerable fleet in the Mediterranean; obviously a most dangerous situation would arise if this fleet was able to use the Dardanelles as an impregnable base, all the more if there were to be an alliance between Russia and France. The activities of the Russians in the Levant were very disturbing; Catherine had. made herself the protector of the Greeks, and in 1768 for the first time a Russian fleet had sailed from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. It did so with the consent and active assistance of the English, who supplied provisions and lent the services of British officers.  In 1770,
under British officers, it actually entered, though it did not pass through, the Dardanelles. But this friendly feeling soon disappeared; the British Government became suspicious and jealous, and withdrew their active support.Napoleonic Wars.9. During the revolution and Napoleonic wars, the question of the Straits became involved in the great struggle which was taking place. It was a period during which Russian policy was marked by a series of extraordinarily rapid vacillations. But throughout&quot; it all we see running the one firm purpose of securing control over the Straits with the particular object of extending Russian influence and Russian naval power in the Mediterranean. On the other hand, we have Napoleon, with restless energy, carrying out his great project, the destruction of British maritime supremacy and the overthrow of the British Empire in India. In this he saw that the Levant was one of the cardinal points, and he never ceased to work in order to secure the help, now of Turkey, now of Russia, in this great ambition.10. The first stage comes in 1798, immediately after the accession of the Emperor Paul. The French, who had already occupied the Ionian Islands, sent out their fleet from Toulon; it seized Malta and went on to Egypt. The Russians had believed that Constantinople would be the objective, and, in fact, an attack on this city was in Napoleon&apos;s mind. The first result was an unwonted combination; an alliance was concluded between Russia and Turkey, which was joined by Great Britain; this is of great importance for the history of the Straits, for by it Russia undertook to send a fleet to defend the Turkish possessions, while Turkey, on her side, now for the first time granted to Russia, &quot; for this occasion only,&quot; free passage for her ships of war through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. A Russian fleet availed itself of this permission; it appeared in the Mediterranean and took an active part in the operations against France as an ally of England and Turkey. It seemed to be the beginning of a new epoch. Not only did the fleet sail there once, but there was a constant coming and going; it seemed to be the obj ect of the Russians that the presence of their&apos; ships of war in the Straits should become a habit. This fact produced grave apprehension in England, although for the moment the two countries were allied, and it was this jealousy which was one of the principal causes of the sudden change of policy by which in 1801 Paul joined Napoleon. The result of this was that the Russian fleet, which was in the Levant, became an ally of the French, ready to take its part in an attack on the road to India, and the whole Asiatic position of Great Britain.A lexander I and Russian Policy.11. The Emperor Paul was assassinated in 1801, and at the beginning of Alexander^ reign an important discussion took place as to the policy which should be pursued by Russia with regard to the Straits. Among other contributions Count Kotchoubey presented a memorandum to the Emperor which had great influence on Russian policy for many years. There were, he said, two possible systems between which Russia, could choose; the first was a partition of the Ottoman Empire in agreement with France and Austria; the second was to oppose any such policy of partition as dangerous to Russian interests. He strongly advocated the latter course. Russia had no need of further territories, and she could not hope to have a neighbour more inoffensive than Turkey. The preservation of the Ottoman Empire must, in the future, be the keystone of Russian policy. By working with Turkey Russia had gained greater advantages than in all her wars against Turkey; the treaty of 1799 gave free passage to Russian ships of war, and the creation of the Republic of the Ionian Islands was a pretext for demanding the continuation of this right. This conception was in fact adopted by the Russian Government, and, with few exceptions, they ceased from that time to appeal to the vague mystical conception of Russia&apos;s mission for driving the Mussulman out of Constantinople, which had played so large a part in the reign of Catherine. Their aim was not to destroy the Ottoman Empire, but to maintain it, but at the same time, to keepi it in a state of subjection :  &quot;It is, wrote the Emperor Alexander, one of the fundamental principles of my political system, to contribute in every way to preserve the Empire of Turkey, the weakness and bad internal administration of which constitute valuable guarantees of security.&quot;
It was, as a French writer notes, the practical application of the celebrated theory of Montesquieu, according to which nothing could be more advantageous to a State than to have very weak neighbours. The device of maintaining a weak State on the frontier instead of annexing it is one common to all great conquering countries; it was the attitude of Rome towards Armenia, of England towards Afghanistan, of Germany to the Baltic Provinces in 1918. The adoption of this principle did not of course mean that the Russian Government had once and&apos; for all dismissed from their minds the larger ambition; it was only postponed, postponed because they saw that any attempt to seize Constantinople itself would inevitably raise a European coalition against them. But difficulties were soon experienced in carrying out this policy. It was necessary that no other State should gain predominant influence over the Porte; it was necessary also that the Government of Turkey should not be transferred to younger and more vigorous hands. If either of these contingencies occurred, or threatened to occur, Russia at once was ready to intervene in arms, as in 1833, in 1912 or in 1914. Moreover, it was soon found that the attempt to exercise exclusive influence over the Porte brought about a coalition as surely as an attempt at actual conquest would have done.12. To trace in detail the working of opposing policies at the Court of St. Petersburg during the next century would be a task of extraordinary interest, and in this way alone is it possible to explain the rapid and often almost incomprehensible changes of Russian policy, which were especially marked during the Napoleonic era and since. That which outside observers, particularly the British Government, saw was the steady purpose which, under different forms, was always present, of establishing exclusive Russian influence, and with this object, of bringing about an arrangement by which Russian warships alone should have the right of navigating the Bosphorus. In this country, whatever Government might be in power, there was always present the gravest suspicion of Russian actions and Russian motives, and a complete distrust of any offers of friendship. This attitude continued with very few and temporary exceptions (Fox and Gladstone) down to the year 1907. It would be impossible to maintain that it was unjustified, for however genuine the professions of friendship of a particular Tsar or Minister might be at the moment, no one could doubt that any concession made to Russia would, on some future occasion, be used as a step towards objects which could never be conceded.13. To return to the narrative. The death of Paul and the accession of Alexander stopped the sudden friendship of France, and long negotiations took place between 1802 and 1805 concerning the formation of the new coalition against Napoleon. In these we findl that, even after, the death of Paul, the question of Malta takes a prominent position; the Russians were always demanding the island, or, at any rate, the right to have a. garrison there; they had succeeded in getting, together with Turkey, the protectorate over the Ionian Islands. In constant, pursuance of their object to extend their maritime power in the Levant by alliance with Turkey, in 1805 they negotiated a new treaty with Turkey which is of great importance, for in it we find the two essential points of Russian policy, the closing of the Black Sea to the warships of all other nations, and the opening of the Straits to the Russian fleet : &quot; The high contracting parties are agreed in regarding the Black Sea as closed, and in not permitting the appearance of any flag of war or armed vessel of any Power whatsoever, and in case anyone should attempt to appear there in arms, the two high contracting parties engage to regard such an attempt as casus fcederis, and to oppose it with all their naval forces, this being the only method of assuring their reciprocal tranquillity; it being understood that a free passage by the Canal of Constantinople will continue for the ships of war and military transports of His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, to which, on each occasion, the Sublime Porte will give, so far as it depends on it, all assistance, and will grant all facility.&quot;14. Eventually Alexander joined the coalition; Napoleon therefore now aimed at using Turkey as a weapon against his enemies; they, notwithstanding their treaty, closed the Straits to the Russians.  War between Russia and Turkey followed.   Wefet then the situation of Russia and England working together to win over Turkey rom French influence, and with this object, Admiral Duckworth (February 1807), with the English fleet, sailed up the Dardanelles and appeared before Constantinople with the apparent intention of dictating their course to the Turks, and if Turkey refused the conditions offered, of bombarding Constantinople and destroying the fleet. This is the first time that a fleet sailed through the Dardanelles, and demonstrated the
Gincapacity of the Turks properly to protect the position. But there was no Nelson at Constantinople; the English had come to threaten, but when their demands were refused, feared to strike. The Turks delayed and procrastinated, and the English fleet sailed away under the fire of the batteries of the Dardanelles, leaving untouched the main Turkish fleet, which they ought to have dealt with as the Danish fleet had been treated.15. Another quick change took place. After Tilsit, 1808, Alexander became the ally of Napoleon. Napoleon&apos;s object was to secure Russian help against England! in the Mediterranean, and for this purpose to force the Turks to open the Straits to the Russian fleet. He attempted to bring about an agreement between Russia and Turkey, but at the same time he started negotiations with Alexander about the partition of Turkey. These negotiations are, even at the present day, of great interest, for one feels how little the world has changed. They broke down on the question of the Straits. Two alternatives were put forward : (1) that Constantinople should be established1 as a free city; (2) that it should be held by Russia. Alexander chose the latter, but he required not only Constantinople and the surrounding territory, but the Dardanelles as well. This Napoleon refused. If Russia was to have Constantinople, the French must hold the Dardanelles; otherwise, as the French envoy said, the Russian fleet would soon be at Malta, Naples and Toulon.16. As a guarantee against these proposals the English, who were now friendly to Turkey, made a treaty, which is of great importance as the first step towards what was to prove for fifty years the definite solution. The important clause runs as follows : &quot; As ships of war have at all times been prohibited from entering the Canal of Constantinople, namely, in the Straits of the Dardanelles and of the Black Sea, and as this ancient regulation of the Ottoman Empire is in future te be observed by every Power in time of peace, the Court of Great Britain promises on its part to conform to this principle.&quot;In this we get, for the first time in a treaty with a foreign State, the formal recognition of what is here called the ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire. But, as has been pointed out, by the very fact that the recognition of this rule by Great Britain is made contingent upon the enforcement of the rule against all other States, the Porte in fact to a certain extent gave up its full freedom of action. Hitherto it had enjoyed and had exercised the right of permitting the passage of ships of war as it desired, in accordance purely with its own wish and interest; henceforth this full sovereignty was to this extent limited, that while the right to close the Straits remained unimpeached, it gave up the free right to open them. At this time the freedom was limited by agreement only with Great Britain.The War of Greek Independence.17. This treaty was the only permanent result of the Napoleonic struggle as regards Turkey. After all their efforts the Russians really had failed in their endeavours; the treaties of 1799 and 1805 were not prolonged by the Treaty of Bucharest (1812). Turkey remained intact and Great Britain had secured the closing of the Straits against the Russians. None the less during the next years Russian intrigues in the Mediterranean continued, and the British Government were more than once seriously concerned by the suggestion of the Tsar, now in connection with the Spanish troubles, now with the Barbary pirates, to send a Russian fleet into the Mediterranean. The outbreak of the war of Greek independence naturally led to a great increase of activity, but the Russian fleet, which took part in the Battle of Navarino, still had to make the long voyage from the Baltic. War between Russia and Turkey followed. When the time came to make peace, an interesting discussion on this matter again took place in the Russian Council of State. The main point discussed was whether it was better for Russia to press on to the dissolution of the Turkish Empire or to be content with maintaining Turkey as a weak Power under Russian influence. The decision was for the latter course; if Turkey was destroyed, Russia must then herself occupy Constantinople and the Straits, but she could not do this without a European war; other Powers would certainly use the opportunity to annex other portions of the Turkish Empire, and the relative strength of Russia might be weakened rather than strengthened. They determined, therefore, to aim at &quot;maintaining political control over Turkey, and in this way keep control over the Straits. In the Treaty of Adrianople (1829) nothing is said about the Straits except the article on the passage of Russian commercial vessels, to which reference has already been maH^
The Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi.18. The opportunity for extending control over Turkey was given by the revolt of Mehemet Ali. When &quot;it appeared probable that the forces of Ibrahim Pasha might appear on the shores of the Bosphorus and seize Constantinople itself, the Russians, acting alone, sent a fleet to Constantinople and disembarked an army on the Asiatic shores of the Bosphorus. Fortunately we need not follow the very complicated negotiations which ensued; it is sufficient to say that this step was regarded with the gravest suspicion by France and England, who, although opposed to the ambitions of Mehemet Ali, did not wish that Turkey should fall entirely into the hands of Russia. Eventually peace was arranged between the Porte and the rebellious Pasha; the Russian fleet and army then withdrew, but the day before they did so there had been signed the celebrated Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi (the 8th July, 1833), which gave to the Russians that which they had always aimed at securing the sole and exclusive right of sending their ships of war through the Straits. The treaty takes the form of a defensive alliance between the two Empires, and the Tsar undertakes, if called upon, to furnish by land and sea as many troops and forces as may be deemed necessary. This, though it is not expressly stated, clearly implies that a Russian fleet might be summoned to pass through the Straits in order to defend the Mediterranean coasts of the Turkish Empire. The public articles are followed by a secret and separate article, by which the Turks bind themselves permanently to close the Dardanelles to the fleets of every other State : &quot; In virtue of one of the clauses of the first article of the Patent Treaty of Defensive Alliance, concluded between the Imperial Court of Russia and the Sublime Porte, the two high contracting parties are bound to afford to each other mutually substantial aid and the most efficacious assistance for the safety of their respective dominions. Nevertheless, as His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, wishing to- spare the Sublime Ottoman Porte the expense and inconvenience which might be occasioned to it by affording substantial aid, will not ask for that aid if circumstances should place the Sublime Porte under the obligation of furnishing it, the Sublime Ottoman Porte, in place of the aid which it is bound to furnish in case of need, according to the principle of reciprocity of the Patent Treaty, shall confine its action in favour of the Imperial Court of Russia to closing the Strait of the Dardanelles, that is to say, to not allowing any foreign vessel of war to enter therein under any pretext whatsoever.&quot;The present separate and secret article shall have the same force and value as if it was inserted word for word in the Treaty of Alliance of this day.&quot;The two parts of the treaty taken together establish a complete protectorate over Turkey by Russia,19. France and England at once entered a formal and identical protest, both at Constantinople and St. Petersburg : &apos;&apos; The undersigned has been instructed to express to the Sublime Porte the deep concern with which the British Government has learnt the conclusion of the treaty of the 8th July between the Emperor of Russia and the Sultan. That treaty appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government to produce a change in the relations between Turkey and Russia, to which other European States are entitled to object; and the undersigned is instructed to declare that if the stipulations of that treaty should hereafter lead to the armed interference of Russia in the internal affairs of Turkey the British Government will hold itself at liberty to act upon such an occasion, in any manner which the circumstances of the moment may appear to require, equally as if the treaty above mentioned were not in existence. &quot;(3)The Russians soon found that they had gone too far; if they were to insist on their rights under this treaty they would be isolated. The Emperor Nicholas is said to have been much influenced by the opinion of the Duke of Wellington. The Duke, who continued the policy of Pitt, and was a confirmed advocate of the closure of the Straits, had been much&apos; disturbed even by the commercial clauses in the Treaty of Adrianople, and, as soon as he heard of them, had written :  &apos;&apos; The navigation of the Dardanelles and of the Bosphorus and, of course, of the intervening sea has been considered as belonging to the Porte as the(8) This protest was avowedly directed only against the public treaty ; it is not clear how soon the secret clause became known.
Thames is ours and as the Rhine belongs to the King of the Netherlands, excepting in as far as the possession of the latter river is limited by the Treaty of Congress (Vienna). These Straits and the intervening sea are, in fact, a mare clausum in the possession of the Porte over which that Power has always exercised, and must always exercise, dominion.&quot;To the Russian Ambassador he said in 1834 :  &quot; With all frankness I declare that, so long as this treaty remains in force, it will be impossible for us not to observe a reticence towards your Government, with which we should so much wish to have a good understanding on all points.&quot;The Duke was Foreign Secretary during the short Tory Government, November 1834-April 1835, and we have from a French source an interesting account of advice which he gave to Lord Palmerstori, who succeeded him, and who is reported as having said to the French Ambassador :  &quot; Lorsqu&apos;en 1835, nous revimes au pouvoir, je me rendis chez le Due de Wellington; mes rapports avec lui me permettaient une demarche de confiance, et je dis au due que 1&apos;Orient etant appele a jouer un grand role dans les affaires de 1&apos;Europe je tenais esseDtiellement a connaitre son opinion sur les deux systemes qui se presentaient a notre politique : travailler a ouvrir la mer de Marmara a nos ilottes et consequemment a celles des autres Puissances, ou la f ermer a toutes, y compris les notres. Le due me repondit sans hesitation : &apos; a la fermer; nous sommes, dans ces parages, tres loin de nos ressources, et la Russie touche aux siens.&apos; Ce mot, continue Lord Palmerston, m&apos;a frappe comme plein de sens et de raison.&quot;^)Convention of the Straits 1841.20. The treaty remained nominally in force for seven years, but never became effective. In 1834 the Russians came to an agreement at Munchengratz with Austria, by which the two Emperors agreed to maintain the Ottoman Empire, and in case of its dissolution, to act together. The whole situation was reviewed in 1839 in connection with the further troubles about Mehemet Ali. The Tsar was now willing to retreat from the position he had secured and to accept the principle that the maintenance of the Ottoman Empire and the closing of the Straits should be made a common European matter. The Russian Ambassador himself suggested to Lord Palmerston that a general agreement should be made by which the Straits were closed to the warships of all Powers; in consequence, in the Quadruple Agreement of 1840 by which the Egyptian problem was settled, it was agreed that if Mehemet Ali refused to submit to the conditions imposed on him and were to attack Constantinople &quot; The high contracting parties, upon the express demand of the Sultan, addressed to their representatives at Constantinople, agree, in such case, to comply with the request of that Sovereign, and to provide for the defence of his throne by means of a co-operation agreed upon by mutual consent, for the purpose of placing the two Straits of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, as well as the capital of the Ottoman Empire, in security against all aggression.&apos;&apos;By this it will be seen that the Tsar gave up his position as sole protector of Turkey; what was meant wras that if the occasion arose and the Russian fleet should pass the Bosphorus, the French and English fleets would sail up the Dardanelles in order to protect Constantinople.A further article states that these stipulations &apos;&apos; shall be considered only as a measure of exception adopted at the express demand of the Sultan, and solely for his defence in the single case above mentioned; but it is agreed that such measure shall not derogate in any degree from the ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire, in virtue of which it has at all times been prohibited for ships of war of foreign Powers to enter the Straits of the Dardanelles and of the Bosphorus.&quot;This latter principle was re-enacted in 1841 as a separate agreement, to which France, who had been excluded from the Quadruple Alliance, now became a party. The terms of this Convention of the Straits are as follows : (*) Depeche &apos;Ju Baron de Bourquenay au Marechal Soult dn 12 juillet 1839. Guizot,&quot; Memoires,&quot; Vol. VI.   (There seems to be uo English record of this conversation.)
&quot; Article 1. His Highness the Sultan, on the one part, declares that he is firmly resolved to maintain for the future the principle invariably established as the ancient rule of his Empire, and in virtue of -which it has at all times been prohibited for the ships of war of foreign Powers to enter the Straits of the Dardanelles and of the Bosphorus; and that, so long as the Porte is at peace, Els Highness will admit no foreign ship of war into the said Straits. And their Majesties the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia, the King of the French, the King of Prussia and the Emperor of all the Russias, on the other part, engage to respect this determination of the Sultan, and to conform themselves to the principle above declared.&quot;Article 2. It is understood that in recording the inviolability of the ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire mentioned in the preceding article, the Sultan reserves to himself, as in past times, to deliver firmans of passage for light vessels under flag of war, which shall be employed as is usual in the service of the missions of foreign Powers.&quot; Article 3. His Highness the Sultan reserves to himself to communicate the present Convention to all the Powers with whom the Sublime Porte is in relations of friendship, inviting them to accede thereto.&quot;21. This convention, with certain modifications introduced in 1856 and 1871, has remained in force ever since, and it is by it, with these modifications, that if no fresh arrangement were made, the navigation of the Straits would presumably still be governed. It requires, therefore, careful examination. The form in which it was finally adopted was chiefly due to Lord Palmerston, and British diplomacy seems .to have been very successful. The original Russian proposal had been that the closing of the Straits, both in peace and in war, should be declared a principle of the public law of Europe. Lord Palmerston, while accepting the policy of closing the Straits, insisted that this should be based on what is called &quot; the ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire,&quot; which had already been recognised in the Anglo-Turkish Treaty of 1809. This was in accordance with the principle which the British Government had always maintained, that Turke)r had complete sovereignty over the Straits. As he wrote-in 1839 :-&quot; Every State was considered as having territorial jurisdiction over the sea which washed its shores as far as 3 miles from low-water mark, and consequently that any Strait which was bounded on both sides by the territory of the same sovereign, and which was not more than 6 miles wide, was within the territorial jurisdiction of that sovereignty.&quot;(s)It will be noted, however, that to a certain extent Turkey, by agreeing to this treaty, surrendered the full rights of sovereignty which she had hitherto possessed, for, while entering into an agreement with other Powers to close the Straits, she thereby gave up the full right which she had hitherto enjoyed, of opening them at her own discretion.22. Again, the Russians had desired that the Straits should be closed in time of war as well as in time of peace. There was much discussion on this point which the British, supported by the Austrians, refused to accept. The importance of this was to become apparent at the time of the Crimean war, and it was at the time funda-mental for British policy. So long as Turkey and England were friendly or allied, the situation was extremely advantageous to us; during times of peace we were freed from the apprehension of a Russian fleet in the Mediterranean; if there was war against Russia, then it could be assumed that we should have Turkey as an ally and thereby the Straits would be open to us -to attack the Russians in the Black Sea. Thirdly, the treaty was one by which the signatory Powers bind themselves, not only as against Turkey, but also to one another; any change would therefore require the consent of all the signatories. (G)(5) I believe, but have not been able to verify the fact, that this despatch was based on an opinion of the Law Officers of the (Jrown.(6) The negotiations between 1839 and 184), and again in 1855-50, were very prolonged and very complicated, and for reasons of space alone, it would be impossible to give any full account of them here. Moreover, especially for the first period, we have to depend almost entirely on French and Russian works; the British archives seem to have never been studied, and there has been no satisfactory account of the discussions written in English.
The Crimean War.23. The next stage is the Crimean war. In September 1854, even before war was declared, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe was instructed to send for the British fleet, which was already at Besika Bay, to come to Constantinople; this led to a protest from the Russians, who declared that we had been guilty of a violation of the treaty. There was a long correspondence on the matter; the justification we put forward was a double one, first the Russian invasion of the Danubian provinces, though not accompanied by a declaration of war, was, in fact, an act of a warlike nature; secondly, and this is that on which the greatest stress was laid, there was grave danger to the Christian inhabitants of Constantinople, and, as Lord Clarendon wrote &quot; When it appears that the lives and properties of British subjects are exposed to serious danger and that the Turkish Government declares itself unable to avert that danger, it is clear that the treaty has no longer a binding force upon us, and that urgent necessity supersedes its provisions.&quot;24. The terms of peace imposed upon Russia at the conclusion of the war were in this matter very severe; the Allies, at the instance of France, demanded that the Black Sea should be neutralised and the naval forces both of Turkey and Russia strictly limited.   The relevant clauses of the treaties are as follows : .(a.) In the main Treaty of Paris : &quot; Article 11. -The Black Sea is neutralised; its waters and its ports, thrown open to the mercantile marine of every nation, are formally and in perpetuity interdicted to the flag of war, either of the Powers possessing its coasts, or of any other Power, with the exceptions mentioned in articles 14 and 19 of the present treaty.&quot; Article 13. The Black Sea, being neutralised according to the terms of article 11, the maintenance or establishment upon its coast of military-maritime arsenals becomes alike unnecessary and purposeless; in consequence, His Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, and His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, engage not to establish or to maintain upon that coast any military-maritime arsenal.&quot;(b.) A separate convention re-enacts the Straits Convention of 1841; (c.) A separate treaty between Russia and Turkey was signed  &quot; Article 1. The high contracting parties mutually engage not to have in the Black Sea any other vessels of war than those of which the number, the force and the dimensions are hereinafter stipulated.&quot; Article 2. The high contracting parties reserve to themselves each to maintain in that sea six steam-vessels of 50 metres in length at the line of flota-tion, of a tonnage of 800 tons at the maximum, and four light steam or sailing vessels of a tonnage which shall not exceed 200 tons each.&quot;This treaty was to have the same force and validity as if it formed an integral part of the general treaty of peace. &quot; It cannot be either annulled or modified without the assent of the Powers signing the general treaty.&quot;The exceptions referred to in article 11 are : (i.) Those specified in article 2 of the treaty between Russia and Turkey;(ii.) The light vessels which the Sultan permits into the Straits for the service of the missions at Constantinople, and also two light vessels which each of the contracting Powers is authorised to station at the mouths of the Danube in order to secure the execution of the regulations relative to the liberty of that river.To these treaties Sardinia was a party, and in consequence the Kingdom of Italy was from the time of its establishment associated with the four Great Powers in all negotiations concerning the Straits.25. It has been contended with much force that in insisting on the neutralisa-tion of the Black Sea and the limitation of the Russian fleet, the Allies had used their advantage more fully than was wise or generous. The British Government was undoubtedly influenced by the strong pressure of popular feeling which at the
-conclusion of war was still very bitter to Russia. Everyone could foresee that the Russian Government would take the first opportunity to free itself from this very . invidious restriction. On the other hand, it must be recognised that the situation between 1841 and 1855 had been very unsatisfactory. A large Russian fleet was maintained in the Black Sea from which it was not allowed to emerge. It could not be used to support Russian policy elsewhere; the building of this fleet could therefore only be interpreted as a weapon for the intimidation and control of Turkey. Its very existence, shut up in the Black Sea, with no other activity open to it, was by itself a menace and incentive to war.Demoralisation of the Black Sea, 1871.26. During the following years there is much official correspondence with regard to the Straits, but this deals almost exclusively with difficult cases as to whether individual ships which applied for permission to go through the Straits came within the terms of the treaties of 1856. The exercise by the Porte of its power to admit guard-ships for the Embassies of Constantinople was very carefully watched, and the British Government, to which every case seems to have been reported, always protested against the admission of any ship of war belonging to any nation which did not seem to be justified by the terms of the treaty. The general question of principle did not come up. The Russian Government were indeed determined to free themselves from what they not unnaturally held to be degrading restrictions on their own sovereign -rights; suggestions came to them both from Austria and from France that they should do so, but they preferred to wait until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war, by which a very favourable opportunity was provided. They were secure in the support of Prussia; France was helpless; the defeat of France made it impossible for Austria to offer opposition to any proposal on which Prussia and Russia were agreed; England alone remained,27. The procedure adopted by Prince Gortchakof was by a despatch of the 31st October, 1870, to inform the Powers who had signed the Treaty of the Straits (1) that the Tsar no longer considered himself bound by the obligations of the treaty of 1856 so far as they limited his rights of sovereignty in the Black Sea; (2) that he believed he was justified in denouncing to the Sultan the special additional conven-tion fixing the number and size of the ships of war.which the two riverain States should maintain in the Black Sea. The declaration, that is, applied only to the Black Sea and did not directly affect the passage of ships through the Straits themselves. As is well known, the British Government, insisting on the principle that a single Power could not free itself from its treaty obligations in this way, had. the matter brought before a conference. which met in London in February 1871. The result of the conference was a convention abrogating the previous treaties so far as they applied to the neutralisation of the Black Sea and the limitation of the ships of war in it. The principle of the closing of the Straits as it had been established by the separate convention of 1856 was maintained, but with the important exception that the Sultan should have the power &quot;to open the Straits in time of peace to the vessels of war of friendly and allied Powers in case the Sublime Porte should judge it necessary in order to secure the execution of the stipulations of the Treaty of Paris of 1856.&quot;A attitude of the United States of America.28. At this stage we may note that from time to time difficulties arose about the recognition by the United States of the Sultan&apos;s right to close the Straits. The Government of Washington have never been parties to any of the treaties with Turkey about the passage of ships of war, and they seem deliberately to have refrained from anything which might be interpreted as giving their assent to the principle that Turkey had the right to close the Straits. The nearest approach to this was in 1868; in that year the American Legation at Constantinople applied for permission for Admiral Faragut to pass in his flagship through the Dardanelles to Constantinople, and in making the request observed that America had no princes of the royal blood, but that Admiral Faragut, on account of his high standing and rank in his country, might be considered as such. The request was supported by the Russian Ambassador, who &apos;&apos; did all in his power to make it appear that the British Ambassador was the principal obstacle which prevented the Porte from granting an act of courtesy which would be highly appreciated by the American people.&quot; The request was refused by the Porte.   In the course of conversation 
The American Minister at first argued that as the United States Govern-ment was no party to the treaty of 1856 it was not bound by it, but, on the Turkish Minister maintaining that inasmuch as the treaty was officially communicated to the American Government and that it did not protest against it at the time it was equivalent to an acceptance of it, the American Minister recognised the principle of closing the Straits as established by treaty, and stated that his application in favour of Admiral Faragut was an entirely exceptional one.&quot;It seems, however, doubtful whether the American Minister would have been supported by his Government in using this language. The position of the United States(7) was carefully to refrain from recognising the right, while acquiescing in it in fact. In 1868 a resolution of Congress urged the Government to procure &quot;the perfect freedom pf navigation through the Straits to all classes of vessels.&quot; No action was taken on this, but in 1871 the President explained that, while he was &quot;not disposed prematurely to raise any question to disturb the existing control which Turkey claims over the Straits leading into the Euxine,&quot; he deemed it &quot;important to avoid recognising it as a right under the Law of Nations.&quot;&quot;The Black Sea, like the Baltic, is a vast expanse of waters which wash the shores not only of Turkish territory but those of another Great Power, who may in times of peace at least expect visits from men-of-war of friendly States. It seems unfair that any such claim as that of Turkey should be set up as a bar to such an intercourse, or that the privilege should in any way be subject to her suffranee. There is no practical question making it necessary at present to discuss the subject, but should occasion arise when you are called upon to refer to it, vou will bear in mind the distinction taken above, and be cautious to sro no further than to recognise the exclusion of the vessels as a usage.&quot;And again,&apos;&apos; The proper occasion may arise for us to dispute the applicability of the claim to United States men-of-war. Meanwhile, it is deemed expedient to acquiesce in the exclusion.&quot;The Russo-Turkish War and the Congress of Berlin.29. During the following years interest was directed rather to the land possessions of the Sultan, to the endeavours of the Bulgarians and Serbians to attain freedom and independence, and even at the time of the Russo-Turkish war of 1878, comparatively little discussion took place on the more limited question of the Straits. While the Russian army advanced on Constantinople, no attempt seems to have been made by the navy to force the Bosphorus. During the period of profound tension at the end of the war, the British fleet was sent to Besika Bay, and notwithstanding the protest of the Porte, sailed through the Dardanelles, and for six months was stationed in the Sea of Marmora. The Treaty of St. Stefano did not contain any clauses dealing with the passage of warships through the Straits, and the final Treaty of Berlin merely re-enacts the Treaty of Paris and the Treaty of London.30. It appears, however, that Lord Salisbury, who succeeded Lord Derby as Foreign Secretary in April 1878, was even at that time disposed to give up the traditional policy of closing the Straits. In a letter to Lord Beaconsfield of March 1878, he enumerates as one of the objects to be obtained, &quot; effective securities for the free passage of the Straits at all times as if they were an open sea,&quot; He would be glad &quot; if the Straits could! be declared as open as the Sound,&quot; and suggested that they should either be neutralised and their fortification forbidden, or that the right to blockade them in time of war should be recognised and freed from international impediments. And again, in June, after referring to the objections which used to be urged against throwing open the Straits altogether, he says : &quot; The exclusion of Russia from the Mediterranean is not so great a gain to us as the loss resulting from our exclusion from the Black Sea, because we are much the strongest as a naval Power. &quot;(s) We could not have a more complete repudiation of the view taken by the Duke of Wellington. The change of attitude is easily explicable by the altered circumstances.   There was no longer cause to fear the effect of a Russian0) J. B. Moore, &quot; Digest of International Law,&quot; Vol. I, pp. G04-668. (8) &quot; Life of Lord Salisbury,&quot; Vol. II, pp. 214, 291.
fleet appearing in the Mediterranean, and the experience gained during the Crimean war had shown how important it might be at-any time to have free access to the Black Sea.31. The fact that he held this view is the explanation of a well-known episode at the Congress of Berlin. Before signing the treaty, Lord Salisbury, on behalf of the British Government, handed in a protocol:  &quot; Considering that the Treaty of Berlin will modify an important part of the arrangements sanctioned by the Treaty of Paris of 1856, and that the interpretation of article 2 of the Treaty of London, which is dependent on the Treaty of Paris, may thus become a matter of dispute, I declare on behalf of England that the obligations of Her Britannic Majesty relating to the closing of the Straits do not go further than an engagement with the Sultan to respect in this matter His Majesty&apos;s independent determinations in conformity with the spirit of existing treaties.&quot;At the next meeting Count Shuvalof presented a counter protocol: &quot; The plenipotentiaries of Russia, without being able exactly to appreciate the meaning of the proposition of the second plenipotentiary of Great Britain respecting the closing of the Straits, restrict themselves to demanding, on their part, the insertion in the protocol of the observation: that in their opinion the principle of the closing of the Straits is a European principle, and that the stipulations concluded in this respect in 1841, 1856 and 1871, confirmed at present by the Treaty of Berlin, are binding on the part of all the Powers, in accordance with the spirit and letter of the existing treaties, not only as regards the Sultan but also as regards all the Powers signatory to these transactions.&quot;An explanation of the action which he then took was given by Lord Salisbury in the House of Lords, when in 1885 war seemed imminent between Great Britain and Russia :  &quot; The object of the declaration which I had to make on behalf of her Majesty&apos;s Government, I understood to be to establish the principle that our engagements in respect of the Dardanelles were not engagements of a general European or international character, but were engagements towards the Sultan only; the practical bearing of that reservation being that if, in any circumstances, the Sultan should not be acting independently, but under pressure from some other Power, there would be no international obligation on our part to abstain from passing through the Dardanelles.&quot;Whatever importance may be given to these practical reasons, it seems very difficult to justify the legal interpretation given to our engagements. It is perhaps the less necessary to do so because at a later date, as we shall see, the British and Russian Governments each took up a position precisely opposed to that which they had taken on this occasion.1878-1908.32. During the thirty years from 1878 to 1908 the position as defined by treaty remained unchanged, but the real situation was in many ways greatly altered. In the first place, we must note the establishment of Roumania, and later of Bulgaria, as fully sovereign States, on the shores of the Black Sea, so that navigation there could no longer be regarded, as it had been in the past, as a matter affecting only Russia and: Turkey. Secondly, the opening of the Suez Canal, -followed as it was by the occupation first of Cyprus and then of Egjzpt by British forces, changed the naval situation in the Levant. As we have seen, Egypt and the Straits must always be considered together, and from the Russian point of view these events constituted a serious change in the balance of power, for which they might well claim some, compensation. Thirdly, the relations of Great Britain and Turkey were becoming less friendly, and this necesarily made the system established in 1841 much less favourable Fourthly, so long as Bismarck remained in office it was the established principle of German policy that they would not oppose Russian ambitions in regard to the Straits, not even as to the possession of Constantinople.33. The third point is illustrated by the events of 1885. When the Russian advance in Central Asia made war imminent between Russia and Great Britain, it was obvious that it would! be to the English interest to use their maritime power in order to attack Russia in the Black Sea; it was here that India must be defended, but
if Turkey maintained neutrality, the Straits would be closed to the British fleet. It seems to have been anticipated in the Chancelleries of Europe, therefore, that in case of war, the British Government would disregard the treaties and violate Turkish neutrality; Bismarck at once set to work with great energy to arrange a European coalition for the protection of the neutrality of Turkey against England. In this he had the support, not only of Russia and Austria, but also of France. The Sultan went so far as to make the enquiry whether &quot; If English ships were to appear before the Dardanelles the neutral Powers would not also send ships there in order to support Turkey in the maintenance of its treaty right to close the Straits, and by their appearance, to stop the English attack.&quot;(&apos;)It is not apparent how far this action of bis was known here; the important thing is that had war in fact broken out, we should have been placed in a most dangerous situation, and been confronted by something like a European coalition. It is from about this time that Turkey began to give more attention to the defences both of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, which hitherto had been neglected.34. Meanwhile new and serious difficulties arose as to the enforcement of the existing treaties. These were ultimately caused by the opening of the Suez Canal. As soon as this took place it obviously was most desirable for the Russian Govern-ment that it should be able to send out both ships of war, military and naval stores and reinforcements of troops to the Far East by this route. It appeared an intoler-able situation that they should still have to depend entirely on the naval ports in the Baltic for this purpose. As the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople said in 1882 to Lord Dufferin :-&quot;It was impossible that Russia should consent to be shut up in the Black Sea inasmuch as the opening of the Suez Canal had completely altered the aspect of the case and rendered it absolutely necessary for Russia to insist upon an immediate transit from the Black Sea to her Pacific possessions.&quot;The Russian fleet in the Black Sea, which a few years before had been inferior to that of Turkey, was in consequence strengthened. That about which the Russians were immediately concerned was not so much the passage of ships of war, as of vessels belonging to the so-called volunteer fieet,(&quot;&apos;) which they wished to use for conveying troops and stores from Odessa; they also claimed that transports carrying soldiers should not be prohibited. On this two points arose; first an interpretation of the treaties; did the exclusion of warships exclude ships which, while flying the merchant flag, were in fact being used as transports; arising out of this was the question how far Turkey should exercise the right of search in order to assure herself that the firman given to an avowedly merchant ship was not being misused. (J1) Secondly, there was the point whether the right of interpreting the treaties rested with Turkey alone. These points were the subject of correspondence extending over many years, but it does not appear that a final settlement was arrived at on any of the matters at issue. The British Government seems on the whole to have adopted a waiting attitude; cases where the passage of either a warship or a transport were admitted were constantly reported to them, but on the whole they seem to have confined their action to warning the Porte that equality of treatment must be granted to all Powers alike.35. From time to time there were rather desultory conversations with other Powers about the general question, but no clear determination was arrived at. In 1896, Lord Salisbury wrote to Sir F. Lascelles :  (?) The correspondence which has been published in Germany, &quot; Die Grosse Politik der Europiiischen Kabinette, 1871-1914,&quot; Vol. IV, pp. Ill, &amp;c, is of great interest.(10) &quot;The Eussian Volunteer Navy was established during- the Russo-Tnrkisli war, 1877-1878, at the instance of a patriotic association, when hostilities with Great Britain seemed imminent. The ships of this fleet carry the mercantile flag- in time of peace and may engage in commerce, though they are usuallv employed&apos; in the public service as transports between the Black Sea and the Russian possessions in the Far East &quot; Their crews are subject to naval discipline and training, and the two principal officers of each vessel are commissioned by the Government. In 1900 they took part in the Chinese expedition despatched by the Powers as a result of the revolt of the Boxers.&quot; (Phillipson and Buxton &quot; The Question of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles,&quot; p. 170 )(U) It may be convenient to note a difference as to the procedure observed with regard to the passage of merchant ships on the one hand, and ships of war and vessels belonging to the Volunteer Fleet on the other. The latter had in each case to receive an irade&apos;, which is in the nature of a personal expression of the sovereign will of the Sultan ; merchant vessels required only a firman which could be issued by subor-dinate officials who were merely carrying out general regulate;ons contained in an irade which had alreadv been issued.
&quot;Our view is and has been for some time past in favour of opening the Straits to all nations. The opening of the Dardanelles alone would be a less complete and satisfactory arrangement, but it would be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;But the next year, when he was consulted by the Austrian Ambassador as to the policy to be pursued for the protection of the Straits against any enterprise on the part of Russia, he answered :&quot; Owing to the change which had taken place in British public opinion towards Turkey, the altered attitude of the Porte and the increased fortification of the Dardanelles, His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to pledge themselves to any specific course of action, and their policy must depend upon the course which events might take and the circumstances in which the question might present itself.&quot;In 1897 when difficulties arose about Armenia, the closing of the Straits became very inconvenient, for it prevented the British Government using the fleet to support its policy in the Black Sea. On this occasion, however, the Porte permitted the strengthening of the guard-ships at Constantinople to all the signatory Powers, in order that they might protect the Christians of that city against the disturbances which were anticipated.The Russo-Japanese War.36. With the outbreak of war in Russia and Japan in 1904, these problems suddenly assumed the most urgent importance and in consequence of her alliance with Japan. Great Britain was especially interested. It was necessary to face the question what should be done if, contrary to expectation, the Black Sea fleet actually sailed through the Straits in order to join the Baltic fleet on its adventurous journey to the Yellow Sea. Mr. Balfour and Lord Lansdowne agreed that if they did so we were under a moral obligation not to allow7 the fleet to sail through the Suez Canal, and that for this purpose it would be necessary to have a superior British naval force in the Levant. The question was discussed in what way the necessary warning could be sent to the Russians, but in fact the Russian Government no doubt well understood the situation, and there is no evidence that they ever proposed to send out the Black Sea fleet. A difficult case arose when two vessels belonging to the Russian Volunteer fleet sailed out through the Straits and the Suez Canal disguised as merchantmen. After entering the Red Sea, however, they assumed the character of ships of war and seized several vessels, including a British steamer, on the charge that they were carrying contraband : *&quot; The British Government protested against the act and declared that if the capturing vessels were commissioned warships, Russia had. violated the treaties relative to the Straits in failing to obtain the necessary authorisation for the passage, but if they were merchantmen, she had infringed a fundamental principle of international law which restricts belligerent operations to lawfully-commissioned warships. Thereupon the commissions of the two vessels were revoked and reparation was eventually made.&apos;&apos;The conditions attached by the Porte to the transit of transports was of such a nature that the Russian Government was not able to comply with them.37. It is not proposed here to discuss the legal problem of what for the purposes -of the Straits Convention constituted a &quot;ship of war,&quot; but no one can read the correspondence which took place without realising how intolerable the situation must have been to the Russians. They were engaged in a great war, on the result of which their whole position in the Far East depended; they had a considerable fleet in the Black Sea, and in addition, the Port of Odessa was their largest and most convenient depot from which stores and reinforcements could be despatched. They found themselves, however, in the position, that they could not freely use these resources and had to depend chiefly on their Baltic establishments, the use of which involved not only a long additional sea voyage, but also the transport of goods and men from the south to the north of Russia. We cannot, therefore, be surprised if, after peace had been made, the efforts of Russian diplomacy were once more -concentrated on solving the question of the Straits in a sense favourable to themselves.
HiThe Entente.38. The signing of the Anglo-Russian Agreement in 1907 naturally had a great effect on Russian policy in the Near East, all the more that it was immediately followed by the outbreak of the Turkish revolution, which, among its consequences, involved a reopening of the Eastern question, the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, the war between Turkey and Tripoli, and the Balkan war of 1912. The fact that Russia was in alliance with France, and now for the first time in close friendship with Great Britain, inevitably raised hopes that the maritime Powers would withdraw the opposition which had for so long impeded the attainment of Russian ambitions. These ambitions were, in the first place, the opening of the Straits to Russian ships of war (and they hoped to secure this without at the same time giving access to the Black Sea to the ships of other nations); secondly, supposing, as became year by year more probable, the Turks were to be expelled from Europe, the acquisition in some form or another of Constantinople, the zone of the Bosphorus, and of the Dardanelles.39. In the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 no reference was made to the question of the Straits, and it does not appear to have been discussed in the Reval interview of 1908. The British Government had, however, been warned that Russia would use the favourable opportunity to ask for some modification of restrictions which recent events had shown were extremely inconvenient to them. The question, therefore, arose and was considered, what attitude His Majesty&apos;s Government should take if any such request were made. There were two points for consideration : (1) a naval question; (2) the interpretation of the existing treaties.(1.) The naval question was referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence, and the question was asked &apos;&apos; what difference would it make to the balance of power in the Mediterranean if Russia were to obtain, through possession of Constantinople, free egress from the Black Sea through the Dardanelles, this remaining closed, as at present, against other Powers ? The answer unanimously accepted was that &quot;while Russia would no doubt obtain certain naval advantages from the change, it would not fundamentally alter the present strategic position in the Mediterranean.&quot; It will be observed that the answer is very carefully restricted and only deals with the naval position as it was in the unusual collocation of the time, and naturally does not imply that the opening of the Straits would not have serious strategical importance in the future. So far as it goes, however, this clearly gave freedom to the political handling of the question.(2.) A second point necessarily arose as to the diplomatic procedure which should be adopted if Flis Majesty&apos;s Government were disposed to withdraAv their opposition to the egress of the Russian fleet. In this connection, the statement made by Lord Salisbury at the Congress of Berlin in 1878 became important. According to; the doctrine which he there laid down, &quot; the obligations of His Britannic Majesty relating to the closing of the Straits did not go further than an engagement with the Sultan to respect in this matter His Majesty&apos;s independent determinations in conformity with the spirit of existing treaties.&quot; This appears to mean that on this matter there were no treaty engagements to the other European States and, therefore, it would be open to His Majesty&apos;s Government, if the Sultan of his own free will declared his intention to permit the Russian fleet to pass through, simply to express their approval of this course; no alteration in existing treaties would be required. If, then, the other States of Europe took up the same view, all that would be necessary would be that the Russian Government should persuade the Sultan to take this course, agree with each State signatory to the Treaty of 1878, not to raise any objections, and the thing would be done.40. Curiously enough, however, the statement made by Count Shuvalof might appear definitely to have debarred the Russian Government from accepting this view. They had declared that in their view &quot; the stipulations concluded in 1841, 1856, 1871, confirmed by the Treaty of Berlin, are binding on the part of all the Powers . . . ., not only as regards the Sultan, but also as regards all the Powers signatory to these restrictions.&quot; This means that the signatory Powers were bound not only to the Sultan, but also to one another, and they could not free themselves from these mutual obligations except by a joint protocol or treaty, the framing of which would obviously require a special conference for the purpose.41. From subsequent negotiations it appears that Sir Edward Grey and the Cabinet were not prepared to act in accordance with the opinion given above; while the Russian Government, ignoring their previous declaration, contended that they
could settle the matter by separate negotiations with Turkey, Sir Edward Grey was generally inclined to oppose this view, to maintain that it was a European question and that, though the British Government was prepared to alter its attitude with regard to the material question, it still must come before the Powers as a whole. The whole transaction is a curious illustration of the manner in which the views taken by States of their treaty obligations may change with circumstances.M. Isvolsky and the Annexation Crisis.42. Immediately after the outbreak of the revolution in Turkey in July 1908 we lincl M. Isvolsky, who was then Foreign Minister, taking up the matter with great energy. This was the chief object of the journey which he took round Europe in the autumn. He seems to have prepared the way by an aide-memoire of the 2nd July, which was laid before the Cabinet of Vienna, in which he intimated that while both the annexation (of Bosnia and. Herzegovina) and also the question of Constantinople, the adjoining territory of the Straits, was a European matter, he was prepared to enter into conversations on it with the Austrian Government. Count Aehrenthal, while expressing general agreement, put forward two conditions : first, that the other riverain States of the Black Sea; Rcumania and Bulgaria should have the same right for their vessels of war as Russia; secondly, he required guarantees for the security of Constantinople against an attack by a Russian fleet entering the Bosphorus. He suggested as the natural model of the new arrangement the inter-national treaties on the Suez Canal, but would add a provision that only one ship of each nation might pass through the Straits each twenty-four hours.43. During all the subsequent negotiations we find constant reference to the Suez Canal Convention; it was suggested that the regulations contained in it for the passage of ships of war would be a convenient model for a new Straits Convention. But language is often used which seems to imply that there was some restriction on the number of warships belonging to any one Power that could pass through the canal at the same time. This seems to be a misapprehension; there is no such provision. In time of peace the canal is open to ships of all nations, whether of commerce or of war, without restriction. The only special regulations as to warships refer to ships of belligerents during the time of war; this article reads as follows :  &quot; Article 4. The maritime canal remaining open in time of war as a free passage, even to the ships of war of belligerents, according to the terms of article 1 of the present treaty, the high contracting parties agree that no right of war, no act of hostility, nor any act having for its object to obstruct the free navigation of the canal, shall be committed in the canal and its ports of access, as well as within a radius of 3 marine miles from those ports, even though the Ottoman Empire should be one of the belligerent Powers.&quot; Vessels of wrar of belligerents shall not revictual or take in stores in the canal and its ports of access, except in so far as may be strictly necessary. The transit of the aforesaid vessels through the canal shall be effected with the least possible delay in accordance with the regulations in force, and without any other intermission than that resulting from the necessities of the service.&quot; Their stay at Port Said and in the roadstead of Suez shall not exceed twenty-four hours, except in case of distress. In such case they shall be bound to leave as soon as possible. An interval of twenty-four hours shall always elapse between the sailing of a belligerent ship from one of the ports of access and the departure of a ship belonging to the hostile Power.&quot;In truth there is little analogy between the Suez Canal and the Straits. The great difficulty about the Straits is that they give access to Constantinople, and in consequence it would be possible, if there were free and unrestricted use of them by ships of war, for any nation in time of peace to accumulate a fleet in the Sea of Marmora, and then make a sudden attack on the city. The canal is far removed from all the vital parts of Egypt, so that this point naturally does not arise. We may also note that, so far as this countrv is concerned, circumstances are completely different, for the obvious reason that the British navy controls access to both ends of the Suez Canal, while, in case of war with Russia, a British fleet passing through the Straits into the Black Sea would, on emerging, find itself in what we may call enemy country.44. On the 5th September, Isvolskv had a conversation with Tit ton i, and. immediately afterwards, with Herr von Schoen, the German Foreign Secretary, who in a general way was informed of what was going on and expressed his. approval. On the 15th September he met Aehrenthal at Buchlau.   No formal written note of
the conversation was made, but there was a general agreement that Russia should support the Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina while Austria would give Isvolsky a free hand in the Dardanelles. Austria-Hungary did not accept the offer of the Sanjak which Isvolsky made, but, on the other hand, Isvolsky undertook not to seize Constantinople or any territory in its neighbourhood. Russian ships of war were to have the permission to pass the Dardanelles singly, but not in squadrons. The whole matter was eventually to be regulated by a European Conference.45. It was Isvolsky&apos;s belief that matters would not be hurried, and that he would have an opportunity of discussing his projects with France and England, and with this object he pursued his journey to Paris. As is well known, Aehrenthal, proceeded to immediate action, and the annexation of the two provinces was announced on the 6th October. This was extremely inconvenient to Isvolsky, who had hoped that, having come to an understanding with Austria (and through Austria with Germany), he would then assure himself of French support, and, finally, be able to put his request before the British Government under such conditions that it would be very difficult for them to refuse. The hasty action of Aehrenthal upset the whole plan; his hopes were disappointed; he was compelled to give an explanation of his activities, which caused Sir F. Bertie to say : &quot; I have the impression, I may say the conviction, that he did not quite tell me the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.&quot;46. At the beginning of October he came to London and raised the question in conversation with Sir Edward Grey. The procedure he put forward was now-altered; he did not propose to bring the Straits before the European Conference, which, at the time, was in contemplation. He wished it to be the subject of separate, conversations between Russia and Turkey; what he asked wras that, if he came to an cigreement with Turkey, the British Government wrould not raise any opposition. In doing .so he used language which was clearly meant to&apos; indicate that the future of the Entente would depend upon the answer which he received. The following is Sir Edward Grey&apos;s account of a conversation of the 10th October :-&quot; M. Isvolsky urged very strongly that, if Russia could satisfy Turkey that an arrangement about the Straits was safe for Turkish interests, England -should not oppose it. He told me that there had been great opposition in - Russia to the Anglo-Russian Convention. He had had to-spend great energy in getting it accepted in Russia. AH the Liberal and advanced elements in Russia were in favour of an understanding with England; but the reactionary elements were against it and would like to upset the convention. The Emperor was by training and education not on the Liberal, side. It was possible to keep him reconciled to reforms ill Russia only by proving to him that things -were going better; for instance, whereas two&apos; years ago there was a state of active revolution, the state of affairs was now much improved. In the same wray it would be fatal to a good understanding with England if, when the question of the Straits was raised, it was found, that England blocked the wTay, and that no improvement followed from good relations with England.&quot; His proposal to Turkey would be that ships of war belonging to the riverain Powers on the Black Sea should have a right of way through the Straits. They -would not be allowed, to remain in the Straits. There might-be regulations that not more than three vessels should go through at a time, and that no other vessels should go through for twenty-four hours after the first. Such regulations would, of course, only apply in times when Turkey was at peace.  In time of war, Turkey would! be able to do as she pleased,&quot;In other words, the closing of the Straits would be maintained, subject-to a limited servitude of this kind in favour of Russia and the riverain States.&quot; M. Isvolsky went on to say that the present was a most critical moment.. It might either consolidate and strengthen the good relations between England and Russia or it might upset them altogether. His own position was at stake, for he was entirely bound up with the policy of a good understanding with .. - &quot;. England, which he had advocated against all opposition.&quot; I asked him to give me a draft of what he proposed with regard to the conference, so that I might have something definite to put before the Cabinet; this he promised to do.&quot; I said I realised! how critical the moment was. We were most anxious to work with Russia. We were in favour of the new regime in Turkey, not in order that we might support Turkey against Russia, but because we regarded , an independent and well-governed Turkey as the only alternative to anarchy ; and confusion,
&quot; M. Isvolsky said the Russian desire now was to be friendly with Turkey. They did not wish to have Constantinople for themselves; it was not a place which could be held like Gibraltar, it had to be made a capital, they could not make it their own capital, and they would not wish to see it in any hands but those of Turkey. Therefore, they wished to have a. peaceful and well-governed Turkey, with whom they could be friendly.&quot; I told him I recognised the Russian feeling about the Straits; but the proposal he had now put before me was not the same as that which Count Benckendorff had discussed with me at the time of the Anglo-Russian Convention. The proposal then had been that, while Russia should have egress from the Black Sea through the Straits, other Powers should have liberty to send! their vessels of war into the Straits without going into the Black Sea.&quot; M. Isvolsky pointed out that, as Russia would not ask for any right to stay in the Straits, it would be useless to grant a right of access to the Straits without staying there and without going on into the Black Sea. But he was. not putting the proposal before me now on the ground that I had made any promise previously. He was putting it forward from the point of view of good relations.&quot; If Russia did not make the proposal now, it might be blocked by Germany or Austria at some future time; and; he hoped that if Russia could get the consent of Turkey voluntarily to an arrangement such as he had suggested we would: not oppose it.&quot; I told M. Isvolsky I must have time to consult the Prime Minister and my colleagues, who had seen the proposal made some time ago, but to whom this would be quite new.&quot;47. In a further conversation of the 12th October M. Isvolsky professed to be surprised when Sir Edward Grey made the point that the one-sided opening of the Straits presented objections : &quot; The point I had put to him as to Russian cruisers being able to come out from the Straits into the Mediterranean in time of war, and being able to return again into the Straits free from pursuit, had not occurred to him. He thought it might be met by a provision that in time of war when Turkey was neutral, she should observe her neutrality by giving equal facilities for passage through the Straits to all belligerents.&quot;48. The final answer of Sir Edward Grey to these proposals, given on the 14th October after consideration by the Cabinet, was that the opening of the Straits was a. reasonable demand which should not be opposed, but that it must be on terms of equality to all States, and that it would not be possible to accept a one-sided agreement by which they would be open to Russian ships alone. With regard to the procedure it was necessary first of all to secure the consent of Turkey, and he informed the Turkish Ambassador that &quot;we should make the voluntary acceptance by Turkey on terms considered by her to be satisfactory, a condition of our agreement to any such pro-posal.&quot; The present moment was inopportune, as clearly the Turkish Government did not desire to have the question raised now, but when the time came, if Russia was able to come to a satisfactory arrangement with Turkey, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would not oppose it. The papers dealing with this very important decision are printed in the annex.^49. In the end nothing was. done; the discussions passed off to the Serbian question, and the matter for the time was allowed to drop. M. Isvolsky himself left office a few months later and became Russian Ambassador at Paris.1911 to 1914.50. Though the matter dropped for the time, it continued to be the subject of correspondence between the Russian Foreign Office and Russian representatives abroad, and naturally came up again in consequence of the war between Turkey and Italy (1911) and the Balkan War (1912-13). It would take too long to give any connected account of the discussions, and there are many points which still remain obscure.(12) We note that M. Isvolsky constantly pressed the importance of the matter on the French Government.  In October 1911&apos;, he wrote pointing out that &quot; if we now(13) Our chief authority for these events, in addition to the archives of the Foreign Office, are the recent publications from the Russian archives: &quot; Diplomatische AktenstLicke zur Geschichte der Kntehtepolitik der Vorkriegsjahre,&quot; by B. von Siebert; &quot; Un Livre noir Diplomatic d&apos;avant-guerre d&apos;apres les Documents des Archives russes, Novembre 1910-Juillet 1914.&quot; I have not been able to get access to Hoschiller&apos;s &quot; L&apos;Europe devant Constantinople,&quot; which appears to contain important Russian documents.
decide definitely to raise the question of the Straits, it is very important to secure a good press here.&quot; For this purpose he must have more money. And a month later he explains to M. Louis, French Ambassador at St. Petersburg, that Russia desires to maintain as long as possible the existence of the Turkish Empire, but &quot; on condition that we are freed from old restrictions incompatible with our interests and our dignity.&quot; And if an understanding with Turkey proves impossible, or there is a liquidation of Turkish dominion in Europe, &quot; naturally our point of view as to the Straits would change. Just as France has declared that she could not admit the establishment of any foreign Power whatsoever in Morocco, we are obliged on our side to warn France that Russia cannot admit the passage of the Straits in any but Russian hands.&quot; They expected French support on this matter as a return for Russian support on Morocco.51. At this time (November 1911), M. Tcharykof, the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople, was bringing strong pressure to bear upon Turkey to come to a separate agreement with Russia. The great difficulty, however, was to get England to advance beyond the memorandum of 190S, which was not regarded as satisfactory. On the 2nd November, M. Sazonof wrote to Count Benckendorff : &quot; It appears desirable to us to use the present political situation in order to cause the French and English Governments to declare in a quite concrete and indeed in written form, their point of view on the question of the Straits, and to clo this exclusively towards us, independently of the arrangements which we might eventually make with Turkey. As regards England especially, it is to be observed from your reports, we believe that we can conclude that Grey will make his consent depend on a previous agreement with Turkey. To us a condition of that kind is not quite comprehensible, for apart from the fact that it gives England a new guarantee as regards an arrangement which might perhaps be inconvenient to England, this implies for Turkey a new ground for objections. We do not unconditionally wish to solve the question of the Straits immediately, but to determine the conditions under which this question can be solved. We hope, therefore, that England within these limits, will be able to give her point of view in quite definitely written form, and if you believe that this would form an advance on the memorandum of 1908, we would ask you to discuss the matter with the English Ministers.&quot;And Count Benckendorff answered : &quot;I will try to get a result which is an advance on the memorandum of 1908, although it is always difficult&apos; to move the English Government to general obligations which refer to future eventualities.&quot;And again : &quot;Our object is free transport in both directions; so far as this goes I see no serious difficulty, but to change the Black Sea in time of war into a great harbour of refuge for the Russian fleet, is another question; on this point difficulties would arise.&quot;52. The Turkish Government, which was being pressed by M. Tcharykof, naturally turned for advice to this country, and on the 5th December the following aide-memoire was communicated by the Embassy here : &quot; Russia has proposed to the Imperal Government an understanding to ensure, the one to the other, the free passage of the Straits, to the exclusion, of course, of the warships of all other Powers.&quot; Russia would engage to defend the Straits in conjunction with Turkey in the event of their being attacked by a force of a foreign Power, to assure Turkey of her co-operation in the execution of railway projects in Asia Minor, and to act as an intermediary for the realisation of an entente with, the Balkan States.&quot; The Imperial Government would naturally take as a basis of negotiation the treaties of 1841, 1856, and 1878, regulating the position of the Straits; but in view of Sir E.&quot; Grey&apos;s statement in the House of Commons intimating the- decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to abstain from all intervention as long as English interests are not threatened, they would wish to know clearly, and precisely whether the Foreign Office consider that those interests are threatened: by the advantages which Russia desires to secure to herself by the conclusion of a new arrangement as to the position of the Straits.&quot;
The answer, which was given verbally, was -that the free passage of commercial ships through the Dardanelles was&apos; a c thing in which we were all interested, and which we all desired to see preserved; we therefore could not have any objection to an arrangement with Russia that would secure this free passage. As to opening the Straits to ships of war, I had promised M. Isvolsky in 1908 that we would not oppose the raising of this question, if Russia wished to raise it. But, in so far as this opening would require an alteration of treaties, it was a question which must be discussed Avith the Powers who were parties to the treaties.&quot;This was, in effect, a refusal to accept the Russian proposals for settling the matter by separate conversations with Turkey. The negotiations were, therefore, for the time broken off.58. The Russians, however, during the following years brought another motive to bear. They represented the value which it would be to the Entente if they could depend in case of war on the support of a Russian fleet in the Mediterranean. In June 1912, M. Poincare is represented by M. Isvolsky as saying that &quot; he considers as altogether desirable from the point of view of general policy, and in view of the new situation in the Mediterranean, that France and England should open the exit of the Black Sea to the Russian naval forces, and that he is ready, when the occasion presents itself, to support us with all his efforts for the solution of this question.&quot;This was clearly in the minds of the Russian Government when they concluded in 1912 a naval agreement with France; and in 1914 proposed one with Great Britain.54. Meanwhile, serious events were happening in the Balkans. When, in consequence of the Balkan Alliance, it appeared that danger might eventually arise as to the safety of Constantinople itself, the Russians put forward the suggestion that they should give a guarantee of the safety of the city against the Balkan allies; when the Bulgarian army was actually threatening Constantinople, the Russian Government said that if Bulgarian troops entered the city, the Russian fleet a\would   at once be sent into the Bosphorus; they would not object to the presence of the ships of other nations there, but the Russian fleet would remain until all the others had been AvithdraAvn. The check of the Bulgarian army on the Chatalja lines removed the immediate clanger to Constantinople, and for the moment European discussion was again concentrated on the Serbian question.55. A letter from M. Sazonof to M. Isvolsky of the 28th November, 1912, (13) gives a valuable indication as to Russian policy. They had had to observe &apos; &apos;a certain reserve towards English proposals to discuss the question on an eventual internationalisation of Constantinople and new guarantees for the regime of the Straits.&quot; The reason for this is important. &quot; In our view the fundamental interests of Russia in the Straits cannot be protected by any treaty guarantees and clauses, for these can ahvays be circumvented, but Ave must always consider what actual power is really in a condition to secure a given regime of the Straits from attack from any source.&quot; This means that they would not accept neutralisation or internationalisation, but, if any change was to be made, would be satisfied with nothing less than the actual physical control in their own hands. Again, he would not deal with Austria from the point of view of an arrangement or compensation; he rejected the suggestion (which Isvolsky had adopted in 1908) of making a bargain by winch &apos;&apos; Russia should declare herself disinterested with regard to the western part of the Balkan peninsula, while Austria should give us complete freedom of action in Constantinople.&quot; &quot; This would be injurious to the interests of the Balkan States.&quot; Short of any more satisfactory final solution, &quot;the most practical course seems to us to be to deal with this question of the Straits as in 1908, that is, to empower the riverain States of the Black Sea, under certain conditions which would guarantee the security of Constantinople, to allow their ships of war to pass in and out in time of peace.&quot; And in another letter of the 1st May, he rejects suggestions for financial proposals, the practical result of. which would be that Turkish armaments would be limited and thereby the defence of Constantinople and the Straits imperilled. The Russian Government at this time showed great anxiety when they heard of any proposal for the increase of the Turkish fleet of such a kind that it would imperil Russian predominance in the Black Sea.56. In truth, by the end of 1913 the situation as regards the Straits bad com-pletely changed and the Russian Government was rapidly becoming convinced that they must give up the passive and expectant attitude, which, with few exceptions,.(is) &quot;Siebert,&quot; p. 687.
they had observed for a hundred years; the time seemed to be approaching when, if they were not to lose the reversion of Constantinople, they must act, and act quickly. In the past they had had to do with a Turkey, decrepit, irresolute, influenced only by fear, a Turkey which would at any time be an easy prey. This was gone. If Turkey were to survive, it would be a new Turkey, animated by positive ambitions, national, racial, religious a Turkey which under Enver Bey was adopting the Western conception of Turkish nationalism, was already conceiving the idea of the solidarity of the Turanian race, and at the same time making itself the champion of the Mussulman revival. If, on the other hand and this was perhaps more probable  Turkey were to fall for ever, there were now rival claimants in the field Bulgaria and Greece. But this was not all. A new and more formidable competitor had appeared; Germany was once more strengthening her control over Constantinople which had for a short time after the revolution been shaken, but a German protectorate over Turkey, combined with commercial and political activities in Asia Minor, threatened to present a permanent barrier to the achievement of the national aspira-tions of Russia. These apprehensions were brought to a head when in the winter of 1913, General Liman von Sandars was appointed to command the first Turkish army corps in Constantinople itself. A very serious crisis followed ; it was for the moment overcome, but it was not forgotten, and we cannot be surprised that the Russian Government began to take active measures in order to be ready, when the moment came, to possess themselves of Constantinople and the Straits.57. In November 1913, a memorandum concerning the Straits was drawn up by Basili, Vice-Director of the Chancery of the Minister for Foreign Affairs; it was laid before the Tsar by M. Sazonof, received his approval and at the beginning of March 1914, considered by a special conference at which were present many of the chief political military and naval advisers. This memorandum and the records of the conference which have been published by the present Russian Government, afford valuable indications as to the conceptions by which the Russian Government was being influenced. The main consideration was that, as Sazonof said, &quot; if by force of events the Straits should be withdrawn from the dominion of Turkey, Russia could not allow any other Power to establish itself on their shores, and, therefore, perhaps, might be compelled, to take possession of the Straits and to determine thearrangements for the control of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles.....   Ourhistorical task in reference to the Straits consists in the extension of our dominion over them.&quot; Control over the Bosphorus alone would not be sufficient. Simple neutralisation would not be satisfactory, for there would be no security against its violation, and therefore it would; neither guarantee the exit of the Russian fleet from the Black Sea, nor the closing of the entrance against a hostile Power. It was agreed that the main object would not be secured except as the result of a general European war. In such an event the fleet of the Triple Alliance would be held in check bv the English and French navies; no support could be expected from Greece; &quot;the dream of Constantinople will probably be a hindrance to a closer approach between us and Greece,&quot; but Greece and Bulgaria would probably take opposite sides; Serbia would be fully occupied with Austria. The conference therefore proceeded to a discussion of the military and naval preparations which would be necessary in order, in the event of a general war, to seize Constantinople. Among other measures it was recommended that the Black Sea fleet be strengthened as soon as possible by a strong-brigade of modern dreadnoughts.58. If we are to understand the situation just before the outbreak of war, we must always recollect that for Russia the question of the Straits was predominant; to this the interest in Serbia, though it occupied a much larger part in public controversy, was subordinate. In the past the main opposition bad always come from France and England; Germany had been favourable. Now the situation was changed and it was becoming more and more clear that the road to Constantinople lay through Berlin. If we keep this in mind we shall not be surprised to find that from the very moment that war broke out the Russians began to show extreme anxiety as to the future of Constantinople; when the Gallipoli expedition was proposed, they at once came forward with the demand that the zones of both Straits should be assigned to Russia, and at the beginning of 1915 secured from Great Britain and France a formal acknowledgment of their claim. (,/L)6 J. W. HEADLAM-MORLEY,November 7, 1922. Historical Adviser.(it) These events have been dealt -with  in a separate memorandum &quot; on the Rus?o-British Agreement of .*915 as to the future of Constantinople and the Straits&quot; (E 10990/27/41).
ANNEX.(I-)Memorandum by Sir E. Grey.(Secret.)I GAVE M. Isvolsky to read a setting forth of what the Cabinet had authorised me to say to him about the Straits.After reading it, he said he looked upon it as a carefully considered decision, and, although it did not give all he had hoped for, he would accept it.I told him that the Turkish Government were most anxious not to have the question raised now. The Turkish Ambassador had of himself quite spontaneously developed the same arguments as to inopportuneness which I had used.I had impressed upon the Turks that some opening of the Straits was essential, in the long run, to good relations between Turkey and Russia, and that I believed Russia desired good relations.It would be possible for me, at a suitable moment later on, to advise that the Turks should consider an agreement with Russia on the lines which had been indicated. But I could not do this now, when the Turks themselves had pleaded that, though they might be willing to consider the opening of the Straits later on, they ought not to be pressed at the present time.I assured M. Isvolsky of my own personal desire to get the question settled, because I felt it was essential to the maintenance of good relations between Russia and Turkey and between Russia and us. But the time for a settlement must be chosen carefully.E. G.October 14, 1908.______(II.)Enclosure in Foreign Office despatch No. 319 Secret. &apos; Memorandum.(Secret.)His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that the opening of the Straits is fair and reasonable, and in principle they will not oppose it.If the proposal made was that the Straits should be open on tei-ms of perfect equality to all, the proposal would be one to which no exception could be taken.The difficulty arises from the proposal to give Russia and the riverain PoAvers an exclusive, though limited, right. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot but feel that the time is very inopportune for securing general assent to such an arrangement.Feeling in England has very much resented the action of Austria; it would be greatly disappointed if Russia, after protesting against Austrian action, apparently used the occasion to secure an advantage for herself which had any appearance of prejudice to the position of Turkey or altered the status quo to the disadvantage of others.If, on the other hand, there is cordial co-operation between Russia and England to overcome present difficulties on disinterested lines, the good effect on public opinion here would be very marked and would predispose it to a change about the Straits in a sense favourable to Russia.His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, agreeing in principle that some opening of the Straits is reasonable, cannot refuse to discuss the question.They feel that a purely one-sided arrangement, which would give the Black Sea Powers in time of war the advantage of having the whole of the Black Sea as an inviolable harbour from which cruisers and commerce destroyers could issue and retire at will, free from pursuit by a belligerent, is not one for which public opinion in England is prepared or which it would be induced to accept.Any arrangement, therefore, must be one which, while giving Russia and the. riverain Powers egress at all times under some such limited conditions as .M. Isvolsky has indicated, and securing them from menace or&quot;the establishment of foreign naval Power in the Black Sea in time of Peace, would yet contain such an element of reciprocity as.would in the eventuality of war, place belligerents on an equal footing with regard to the passage of the Straits:
His Majesty&apos;s Government would further observe that the consent of Turkey would be a necessary preliminary to any proposal. To put pressure upon Turkey at this moment to make an arrangement which she might regard, however unreasonably, as a menace to her interests would defeat what we believe is the joint object of England and Russia, viz., to prevent the overthrow of the present Turkish Govern-ment, and the confusion and anarchy which would probably result.(III.)Sir E. Grey to M. Isvolsky.(Private.   Confidential.)Dear M. Isvolsky, Foreign Office, October 15, 1908.My own personal opinion cannot increase or diminish the force of the official statement which I have made. But, as in the course of our conversations I have dwelt much upon the difficulty of settling the question of the Straits at the present moment, I should like before you leave to repeat that my motive in doing so has not been a desire to keep the Straits closed. On the contrary, I positively desire to see an arrangement made which will open the Straits on terms which would be acceptable to Russia and to the riverain States of the Black Sea, while not placing Turkey or outside Powers at an unfair disadvantage. Some such arrangement seems to me essential to the permanent establishment of good-will between Russia and ourselves.I also attach much importance to what you have said to me to the effect that Russia desires now to be on friendly terms with Turkey, and that the opening of the Straits would remove a bar to cordial relations between the two countries. I believe that the course of events will make the truth of this felt. At a favourable time I should be ready to support this view at Constantinople; for the moment, however, Turkey, wrho is beset by sudden troubles, has asked that no pressure should be applied to her to do now reluctantly what she might do willingly later on. And I believe that feeling both at Constantinople and in England wall be so favourably affected by a disinterested co-operation between Russia and England to pull Turkey through the present crisis that this will do more than anything else to prepare the way for dealing with the question of the Straits later on, a state of feeling which I shall welcome.Yours sincerely,E. GREY.
