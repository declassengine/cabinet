[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s government.]Printed for, the, Cabinet.  November .1922.- SECRET.G.P. 4303.THE QUESTION OF MOSUL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I Circulate to my colleagues a note prepared in the Middle East Department on the question of Mosul. In view of the forthcoming Peace Conference, it is essential that we should decide without delay upon the policy to be adopted.D.Colonial Office, November 11, 1922.Recent telegrams from Paris make it quite clear, if indeed there was ever any doubt, that the Turks intend to demand the restoration of Mosul (which has always figured in the &quot; National Pact &quot;) as part of the peace settlement. It has therefore become a matter of immediate urgency that His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide what attitude they are to adopt towards this demand.It is not altogether clear whether the Turkish demand refers only to the town Of Mosul or to the whole of the Mos&apos;ul vilayet of pre-war days. Probably the latter is meant. Geographically, Mosul town lies near the northern limit of the vilayet, and no doubt a boundary line could be found separating it from the districts further south. But, politically, this would scarcely be practicable. Mosul itself is a predominantly Arab town. The plains country is also Arab. On the other hand, the hill country to the east is entirely Kurdish, while along the foothills runs a line of towns (Erbil, Kirkuk, Kifri) whose population is almost entirely Turcoman (speaking a dialect of Turkish). All these towns lie south of Mosul, the last named (Kifri) being only some 50 miles from the northern border of the Baghdad vilayet and less than 150 miles from Baghdad itself. It is certain that, if the Arab town of Mosul goes back to the Turks, the permanent retention of the Turcoman, towns further south will be quite impracticable. In other words, if the town of Mosul goes, the whole vilayet goes, and we shall have the Turks within easy distance of the capital of Iraq.It is understood that the Air Ministry (who are now responsible for the defence of Iraq) consider that this position would be untenable on strategic grounds, and that if Mosul passes to the Turks it will be impossible to hold Baghdad.This paper, however, is primarily concerned with the political aspect of the question. On this, point Sir Percy Cox, the High Commissioner for Iraq, has spoken very strongly in a recent telegram (of the 27th October) : &quot; From the political point of view,&quot; he said, &quot; the contingency of ,our spontaneously restoring Mosul to the Turks has always been regarded by me :as an unthinkable act of bad faith, and it would be so regarded by Feisal and the people of Iraq, especially now that the Treaty of Alliance has been signed.&quot;It is not easy to dispute Sir P. Cox&apos;s view. The whole of the Mosul vilayet lies within the area Within which, in the course of the rather inconclusive correspondence with King Hussein in 1915, we undertook &quot;to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs.&quot; It has been administered as part of Iraq since the end of the war. On Feisal&apos;s election to the Iraq throne we allowed him to visit Mosul as King and to receive the allegiance of the inhabitants. His reception there was enthusiastic. Within the last few weeks we have concluded a treaty with the Iraq State, which, if it made no specific mention of Mosul, was clearly understood by both contracting parties to apply to the whole area at present [9084]
administered from Baghdad. To lop off a large portion of his Kingdom would be a fatal blow to FeisaFs prestige. It is a blow from which we could hardly expect him to recover. It must always be remembered that, though Feisal has done much to make good at Baghdad, he is not a native of the country, has ruled over it for less than a year and a half, and has had a desperately short time in which to foster and develop the very fragile plant of Iraq nationality. His subjects consist not only of comparatively civilised townspeople,, but of turbulent tribesmen living on the confines of the desert and unaccustomed to obey any central authority or to respect any laws but their own. Feisal has prevailed so far because he has enjoyed our support. If we withdraw our support, or if we flout him in the face of the world by giving away Mosul, the whole structure will inevitably collapse. Retirement from Mosul would be universally regarded as a prelude to retirement from Baghdad. The Iraqis would conclude that the British connection was about to disappear, and would hasten to make terms with the Turks while there was yet time.Apart from these considerations, the severance of Mosul would be a serious economic loss to the Iraq State. The vilayet contains some of the most fertile land and practically the whole of the wheat-growing area in the country. It also contains oil-bearing districts essential to the general development of the Iraq oilfields, upon which the future prosperity of the country so largely depends. Further, the population of the vilayet contains a large Christian element numbering nearly 60,000 in all. These people, it may be taken for granted, would not stay behind to be massacred by the Turks, but would follow the British line of withdrawal and add to our other difficulties the problem of a large body of indigent refugees. The Mosul Christians include a section that has very special claims upon us, viz., some 20,000 &quot;Assyrians,&quot; who were expelled from their homes during the war as a consequence of taking the Allied side, and have been living in Iraq ever since. The Archbishop of Canterbury takes a special interest in these people. Arrangements were made last year, with an infinity of trouble, for establishing the Assyrians on a self-supporting basis in the neighbourhood of Amadiah. Large numbers of them serve in the Iraq levies, where they are doing very well. They certainly will not stay behind and trust themselves to the tender mercies of the Turk.The point that it is desired to make is not only that an immediate decision is necessary with regard to Mosul, but that this decision really involves the question of maintaining our position in Iraq as a whole. Our policy in Iraq has been severely criticised in many quarters. It is, of course, arguable that we had better never have gone there, and. that having gone there we should seize the first opportunity of getting away. But, even if that argument is accepted, the opportunity must at least be one that enables us to leave with some degree of credit and dignity. To leave now, at the dictation of the victorious Kemalists, a few weeks after parading before the world (in the form of our treaty with Feisal) our determination to stay, would be an act of pusillanimity quite alien to British traditions. It would reduce our prestige in the Bast beyond vanishing point, and would delight our enemies and humiliate our friends all over the world. It is a lesser consideration, but still one of force, that we should sacrifice all prospect of securing a return on the very large sums that we have spent upon the country.The view of the Department is that there is no alternative but to insist upon the retention of Mosul and the maintenance of the existing northern frontier of Iraq, i.e., the limits of the territory at present administered from Baghdad, including Amadiah and the adjoining region where the Assyrians are settled. It is true that the boundary laid down in the Treaty of Sevres left Amadiah to the Turks; but the Treaty of Sevres has been disavowed by the Kemalists and must be regarded as &quot;not only dead but damned.&quot; We have to work on de facto conditions, under which Amadiah forms part of the Iraq State. Vis-a-vis the Turks we must take our stand on the general ground that Mosul itself is and always has been a mainly Arab town; that the low-lying parts of the vilayet are also Arab, while the country to the east and south-east, which contains other elements, finds its&apos; economic outlet in Baghdad and could not be separated from the adjoining territory without serious disadvantage to itself. It might be possible also to argue that, in view of their policy of removing all Christians from Asia Minor, the Turks cannot reasonably claim an area in which there is a large Christian population; nor can we, in the light of recent experience, leave that population at their mercy.   A further argument, for what it is worth, is that,
when Sir Arnold Wilson&apos;s plebiscite was taken in 1919, the whole country was agreed that, whatever form of government might be set up in Iraq (as to which there was a wide divergence of opinion), Mosul should not be separated from the remainder of Iraq.One argument likely to be advanced by the Turks is that Mosul was in their occupation at the time of the armistice of 1918. The facts are that, at the moment the armistice was signed, active hostilities were in progress not far south of Mosul. The British force, having defeated the Turks, was advancing upon the town; but the actual occupation did not take place until a few days after the armistice was signed. Under the terms of the armistice the status quo was to be maintained, further advance of our troops being permissible only in so far as it might be necessary for the purpose of safeguarding our existing military position. The Turks may therefore argue that, while the occupation of the town may have been justified, its retention is not. As against this argument it would be possible to produce instances in which the Turks themselves have violated the armistice terms, particularly in Southern Kurdistan. . But the better answer appears to be the general one that conditions have changed since 1918; that an independent Arab State has been set up, of which Mosul forms an integral part; and that it would be impossible to disturb this arrangement without gross injustice to the people concerned.There remains the question, which has been raised by the Foreign Office, of a quid pro quo to the Turks for the renunciation of their claims. The view of the Department is that these claims are without justification and that, accordingly, there is no case for compensation. In any case it is a good argument that Mosul belongs, not to Great Britain, but to the Iraq State, and that we are not bound to compensate Turkey for not giving her what is not ours to give. As regards possible compensation by the Iraq State the following points are worth eonsidering : 1. The Turks might be offered participation in the oil development of Iraq. 2. Turkish subjects might be treated in Iraq as foreigners with special privileges, provided that capitulatory rights are extended to Iraqis inTurkey.3. The Iraq Government might undertake to recognise the spiritual suzerainty of the Caliph.4. King Feisal might agree, under article 5 of the recent treaty, to receive a Turkish envoy at Baghdad and to send his own representative to Constantinople.None of these suggestions is free from objection. In particular the admission of Turkish interests into our oil projects would further complicate an already complicated question, and would increase the difficulty that is already being experienced in securing an equitable division of interest between the various parties concerned. Any amount allotted to the Turks would presumably have to be taken in the main from the British share. As to the other points, the future both of the Caliphate and of the Capitulations is still uncertain, but it is presumed that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to take a firm attitude with regard to the latter.The point for immediate decision is whether we are to insist at all costs on the retention of Mosul and, consequentially, on the maintenance of our position in Iraq.Middle East Department, Colonial Office, November 10, 1922.
