Extracts are given from Trotsfcy^ recent speech on &quot;The Russian Revolution ana Prospects of World Revolution&quot;.Walton Mewbold is reported to have been elected an honorary member of the Moscow Soviet aad a deputy member of the Executive of the Third International, in recognition of &quot;the significant services rendered by him to the Russian Soviet Government and the cause of communism in Great Britain&quot;-
&quot;The/Information regarding the- jvrux-Wx.,OorvgrBHfts of theThird International is gradually coming in and--certainspeeches have direct or indireot &quot;bearing on this ooutrtrry-&quot;which renders them interesting:   Bukharin made animportant statement upon the programme of the ThirdInternational: i&quot;Comrades, you are all aware that we shall not adopt a final program at this Congress, owing tct the fact that many of our Parties have not defined their attitude towards this question.    Even the Russian Party has not had the opportunity to disouss the draft v^hioh I now present to you.    Therefore, most of the delegations are of the opinion that it will he more expedient not to adopt a final program at this-Congress, hut to discuss the program now and bring -it up for adoption at the next Congress.    The fact, however, that we have plaoed so important and difficult a question as that of an International program on the agenda of the World Congress, is in itself the best evidence of our mighty growth.   We may express our perfect confidence that the Communist International will also solve this problem, whereas in the camp of our adversaries of the Second and Two and a Half Internationals we observe complete theoretical impotence.&quot;Eberlein delivered the report of the CredentialsCommittee and stated, inter alia, that:&quot;...The British Jarty stated its membership to he 5,116, only 2,300 having paid their membership fees, according to information received by us. Twenty delegates were invited and 7 have arrived. Their credentials were recognized as correct...&quot;The Communist Party of India cannot represent a definite membership, since its work is entirely illegal,   your delegates were invited, one has come, and has been admitted to the Congress with the right to vote.&quot;The Cemnranist Party of Ireland.    Three delegates wefre invited, four have come.   Three admitted with the right to vote, and one wit&amp; a consultative voioe...&quot;The Communist Party of Australia has 960 members, of whom 750 are full paying members.   Two delegates were invited, four have oom*.   Two were admitted with the right to vote, and two with a consultative voice...&quot;The Communist Party of Africa has 200 members on the books, 100 of these being full paying members. One dalegate was invited, two have come.    One has been admitted with the right to vote, and one with a consultative voice...
&quot;The Communist Party of Canada has 4,810 members. One delegate was invited, three have come-    One delegate&quot;was admitted with the right to vote, and two with a Consultative voice,..&quot;The Communist Party of Palestine.    One delegate was invited, and Is now on the way to Moscow...&quot;The Egyptian Party has also sent one delegate, who has been admitted with a consultative voice...&quot;In all, 350 delegates were invited to the Congress, and 394 have come.    Of these 3*isJ have been given the right to vote, and 48 have been given (a consultative voice, while 5 delegates have been given visitors&apos; cards...&apos;&apos;Trotsky^ speech on &quot;The Russian Revolution and prospects of   World Revolution&quot; was published in a special supplement to &quot;The Communist&quot;, as a &quot;Christmas Box to our readers&quot;:oertain passages bear quotation:&quot;The   conquest of political power is the chief political aim of every revolutionary Party*.,    It is only within the last few years that in the intellectual sense, we have been learning to make the conquest of political power a practical aim,&quot;The extent to which that aim has passed beyond the realm of philosophical regulative ideas, the extent to which it has become practical, is proved by the fact that In Russia ca a definite date, November 7th,j 1917, we, as a Communist party leading the working class,! conquered the political powers of the State.&quot;As the course of events was to show, this did not signify the end of the civil war.    On the contrary, it was not until after the conquest of political power that the civil war assumed extensive proportions.&quot;This is a fact of not merely historical interest. It is one from which deductions can be drawn that may prove instructive to the Western European Parties and to the International at large.&quot;Why was it that in Russia the civil war did not begin to rage with all its intensity, until after Eovember 7th, so that subsequently in the north, the south, the east, the west, we had to wage civil war for nearly five years without intermission?&quot;The reason was that we had conquered power so easily ...&quot;...Hte have been/able to maintain power during these five years,   But as far as the Western Euro-peaa Parties are concerned, as far as concerns the Labour movement of the whole world, we can now decide with fair confidence that the Comnronist Parties in other lands will have a far more difficult time of it before the ------  conquest of power and a far easier time of it afterwards^.&quot;Everywhere/
- $ -^Everywhere, we see that the bourgeoisie, put. on the alert hy the &quot;&quot;Russian, -example., and by all the hi^rlwxriaal^.. experience of the lands of capitalist democracy, is aiming,  organising, ana mobilising everything that can be mobilised..,7,This proves that all the before-mentioned forces now block the advance of the proletariat, and that in order to sej.ce power, the proletariat, with the sca^ty^ means at its disposal, must neutralise, paralyse, fight, and conquer them;.&quot;But as soon as the proletariat has conquered power, the bourgeoisie will have no reserves left.   After the conquest of power in Western Europe end elsewhere in the world, the proletariat will have far more elbow room for its creative work than we in Russia...&quot;...Obviously, in so far as the Western European Parties have an easier time after the conquest of power, they will find it possible to engage in the work of expropriation more&apos; systematically and more cautiously.&quot;They will expropriate to that extent only to which, from the economic and organisatory point of view, they are in a position to make use of what they expropriate, even if the exercise of this caution should mean that for the time being they are merely weakening and not destroying the ir enemy... .&quot;In the year 1919, ?/hen great waves of dissatisfaction were rising in all lands, and when the whole of political life was a reflection of this revolutionary movement, tho bourgeoisie was in a state of political disorganisation. To-day, in comparatively tranquil times, when we have to strive to enlist the sympathy of the workers even by putting forward partial demands, there has arisen a situation ir. which the capitalist world has once more great opportunities for establishing its agencies even within the framework of our own world-wide revolutionary Party.&quot;It is therefore, not merely our right to appeal to the revolutionary character of the epoch, but it is also our fixity to quicken up the pace.    &quot;Siis will be done by a thorough purging of the Communist International,  so that when the great moment of struggle comes our organisation may be perfectly equipped and ready for battle.&quot;The difficulties which the Western European Parties have to overcome are ineomparatively greater than those which we had to overcome in the Russian revolution.   For instance, pacifist end reformist illusions are far from being dispelled.    In France a blossoming period of pacifism and reformism is inevitable, unless the revolution should come sooner than now seems possible, thanks to a contatenation of circumstanoes which at present elude our ken...&quot;Similar considerations apply to Britain.    I do not know what the result of the British-Selections is going to be.   But if the Conservatives and the National Liberals should return to power, thsir reign will be short,   England will inevitably experience the substitution of a pacifist democratic trend for a conservative treado    Get this picture into your minds.    Suppose that in Prance there is 1 le bloc des gauches,1 a coalition of the left, forming a pacifist democratic government, and suppose that inBriisaJLn/
Britain there is a Labour Government allied with the Independent Liberals.     What will happen in Germany in that case?     There the social democrats will draw a deep breath.     We shall see a revival of Wilsonism on a broader basis.&quot;There is absolutely no safeguard against the coming of a new period,  imposing in its way, wherein the working class will be stupefied and benumbed by paoifist end reformist trends.&quot;Since the era is revolutionary, since the oppositions are irreconcilable, and since the internal contradictions of capitalism are so extensive, this epoch can be nothing more than the last flickers of a candle that is burning itself out.&quot;Imagine the revolution postponed until this pacifist tide has risen to its height;   will not the French and  j.f British workers,  in the throes of an intense psychological crisis, look around for a political party which has never tried to deceive them?     They will look for a party which; has continued to tell the truth, the naked, brutal truth-throughout this period of pacifist mendacity.&quot;The Communist Party must be able to answer to this description.SEE COMMUNISTSThe Communist Party is about to make a determined effort to capture the ooraaXttees of the co-operative societies: F.L. Eehrhahn, who expects to be elected to the Management Board of the London Co-operative Society, is the dominating influence in thiB direction but the organisation of the attempt is in the hands of a communist named Begley.   The communists think that if they can capture the committees they will be eble to dominate the Co-operative press and use the societies oduoational grants for the purpose of disseminating literature and propaganda.On December 17th Harry Pollitt delivered an interesting exposition of communist policy at a meeting held in the Co-operative Hull, Plumetead, in the course of which he said that the Communist Party stand for revolution but recognise that the people are not prepared for it and that the time is not ripe.   They have therefore deoided to postpone their objective, but in the meantime, will assist the Labour Party --to achieve its objectives.   Affiliation with the Labour party had/
had for the past 2 years been sought and would again be asked at the nest Congress.   3he Communist Party recognised that the Labour Party had a good programme and would assist them by every mean in their power, as at rock bottom the Labour Party also stood for revolution.   La assisting the Labour Party to gain its objectives the Communist Party were slowly but surely undermining the Capitalist class and English Imperialism.   It was for this reason that the Communist Party did all they could to help Ireland to throw off the reins of Imperialism and thus strike indirectly at capitalism.    It was English Imperialism that was the main bulwark against international revolution and the workers millenium.   The Labour Party standing for self determination, would when in power, grant India freedom.   India would then be able with the assistance of the Communist Party to throw capitalism overboard,   $he same would apply to Egypt and other subject countries. It would then be time for a world wide revolution in which the workers would seize and hold power.   The Communist Party realises that this can only be done if the whole oj^; vthe workers unite and in doing so are quite prepared to lay^ aside their main programme until sCme future date.On December 15th some 2,500 people attended a conanunist meeting in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, which was addressed by J.T. Walton Newbold, W. Gallacher and W. Paul, editor of the &quot;Communist Review&quot;.     Headquarters attached considerable importance to this meeting regarding which  -Bell informed Paul that &quot;there is as you will see plenty of scope and I am sure it will be worth your while.   All your expenses shall be met.&quot;The Rev. R.W. Cummings, vicar of St. John&apos;s Church, Huret, was in the chair at the above meeting and onDecember/
December 17th again took the chair for Newbold, this time in his own church on the Altar Steps of which sat a contingent of unemployed marchers from Manchester; one man holding the Red 3?lag*Walton tfowhold, MVP,,, is engaged in procuring information regarding prominent merit era of the House of Commons so that ho can use it if i-ppcvticalt? ari:&apos;!e,.It is reported in the Frebs that on December 3th Walton Newbold was elected an honorary raeiaSer of the Moscow Soviet and a deputy member of the Executive of the Third. International, in recognition of &quot;the significant services rendered by him to the Russian Soviet Government and the cause of communism in Great Britain,;!   It is further reported from the same source that Newbold, in a special interview which was published in the &quot;Isvestia&quot; of December 8th described himself as. &quot;a British representative of the Russian Cotamualet Party.&quot;On DeeexuVer l?th Robert Stewart and E.T* Whitahead landed at  rcwlch from the Hook, having returned from a conference of the Workers1 International Russian Relief Committee in Berlin.

o 8 **417the various steps to he taken in setting up the Industrial Department at Headquarters and in the Districts where District party Committees are in existence.    It has been decided that for immediate purposes the work coming within the scope of the Industrial Department shall he sub-divided into three sections, each section having its Secretary who will he responsible for reporting progress to the Central Committee.&quot;The Sections decided upon were:-Trade Union and Workshop Section.trades Council Section.Press and Information Section.&quot;It is desirable that the District Industrial Committees should if possible sub-divide their work in a similar manner, bo that when instructions as to what has to be done are issued there will be no confusion or waste of time:   the instructions will be handed by the District Industrxal Organiser to the section involved in carrying out a particular piece of work.    The following paragraphs show the necessity for the same form of organisation being established at Headquarters and in the Districts.The Trade Union and Workshop Section.This .Section at Headquarters will be dealing with the national problems as they arise from time to time, both in the Trades Unions and in the Workshops. It will be doing preparatory work in connection with Trade Union conferences, both of national Unions and Federations as well as the Trades Union Congress. Resolutions for the various agendas will be prepared and the District Section will then organise support by the branches in their area.    The  action at Headquarters will inform the Districts when nominations for the various conferences have to be made and the District Section will then arrange for Party members to be nominated.    The District Section will be dealing with district problems that arise in the unions, Buch as special resolutions at Union District meetangs.    It will be getting party members nominated for the District Committee of the Unions, Branch Chairmen, etc.    It will be the special task of this section to organi.se and enrol the nuclei in the unions, and workshops, and generally organise the carrying out of the1 Party policy in the unions and workshops of the district.The Trades Council Section.This seotion at Headquarters will be engaged in working out a campaign to be pursued in the Trades Councils in connection with the United Front policy; also a recruiting campaign for the Trade Unions, etc. The District Section will, through their Trades Council fractions apply these campaigns to the Trades Councils in their Districts,    The section at Headquarters will draft resolutions for the Trades Councils to get placed on the agendas of the Divisional Labour Party Congresses, or the National Labour Party Congress.    The District Section will then endeavour to get such resolutions endorsed by the Trades Councils in their district.    These things are, of course.,
In addition to all the little problems that orop up from time to time, and which the District Section will be continually having to discuss.    They are mentioned to stress the necessary point of similar sections being in exietenoe at Headquarters atad in tho Districts.Press and Information.This section of Headquarters will be arranging for articles to be written and published in the various Trade Union Journals.   The section at the District will be watching for opportunities of getting corres-pondence In the local Press.   For example, during any strike or lock-out the correspondence columns of the local papers almost invariably make attacks upon the workers.   Tho District Section should take these attacks up:   they will know the local conditions:   they will have information as to wages, hours, speeding up, sanitary conditions in the workshops, otc*, and by exposing these in the local press they will be breaking up new ground.The Section at Headquarters will be oompiling information about the Trade Unions and Trades Councils; about wages agreements, hours, etc., to provide data for the Central Industrial Committee.   The section at the District will compile information as to the factories,&apos; mines, etc. in their district and information in respect to bad tactics on the part of local Trade Union officials or District Committees, so as to provide data for the District Industrial Committee.The Central Industrial Committee are aware of the many difficulties that tho District   Industrial Committees will be faced with, but they feel sure that In setting up your Industrial Departments, even where   N you are unable to get sufficient members to form committees for all these sections, you will at least take stops to see that one Comrade is definitely appointed immediately, and as wo progress we shall build&quot;effective committees round each section.&quot;ORGANISATION OF NUCLEI&quot;The Central Industrial Committee has had under consideration the question of organisation of our nuclei in the Trade Unions, Workshops and T*rade Councils^ The Industrial Department has been established and the organisation at Headquarters is proceeding and the most important task In front of the District Industrial Committee is to organise and enrol the Nuclei in their &apos; respective districts...&quot;Wo reoognise that it would greatly assist if you . were in possession of the detailed information that is now being tab\ilated as to the activities etc., of the       ! members of the Party.    This work is being speedily accomplished and we are hoping that within a fortnight the District Party Committees that are already established will have the information about membership in their districts.    In tho meantime we do suggest that your consulttee should go ahead definitely enrolling the $nuclei, appointing group leaders and making arrangements for reporting, etc., with the members about whose activities and scope you are already familiar...&quot;A/

The intention is to leave these stickers when anyunlawful/&quot;A leaflet is at present in the hands of the printers, dealing very fuMy with &quot;HOW A TRADE UBIOH NUCLEUS VORKS&quot;;     also we have printed a handy pocket card which has &quot;TWELVE POINTS OK NUCLEUS WOE&quot;.     These publications will greatly assist you in your work.wTHE UNEMPLOYEDIt is reported that there are at present just over 250 marchers in London:   plans have been considered for &quot;camouflaging&quot; some of the London unemployed in order to Inflate this figure and to hide the fact that the marchers are returning home.     Moat of the marchers are greatly discouraged and many harbour bitter feelings towards their leaders:       several are physically unable to walk longdistances and their condition is pitiable.Mrs. Thring is again active among the organised unemployed and on December 13th forced the marchers1Council of Action to resign en bloc:     the members ot thenew Council are:-
unlawful act is committed in order that It may he known that the act is the work of the unemployed.The Council is trying to arrange for a torchlight procession through the West End on December 23rd and there is some talk of efforts to causJ disorder in the seme area on Christmas Eve:   a visit to St. P?*ulT3 Cathedral is also contemplated. \On December 20tb the Council of Action sent a deputation to the General Council of the Trade Union Congress to discuss the subject of the unemployed generally and in particular the possibility of the General Council bringing pressure to bear to secure the re-assembly of Parliament at an earlier date then February 13th in order to deal with unemployment.   .The deputation was given  10 and told that a written answer would be sent in due course.Tom Bell, the political secretary of the Communist Party, is keeping in touch with the unemployed marchers through E.W. Cent, who reports to Eing Street.     Bell has suggested that the unemployed leaders should issue a daily bulletin:    he added that the Communist Party would print a four page sheet daily on condition that it received any profits as tt was willing to bear any loss.     The unemployed decided   not to accept this offer but to bring out a sheet themselves beginning possibly early in the New Year.On December 17th about 500 unemployed marched to Trafalgar Square where, in company with about   600 spectators they listened to speeches by Baxiningtori, Currie (Dumfries), Cook (Manchester), Martin (London.), Dlngley (Coventry), Robert Stewart, A. Siffleet (Editor of &quot;Out of Work&quot;), Gibson (Sheffield), Shepperson (Birminghsm), GeorgeLansbury/
lansbury, M.P., ana Tom Groves, M.P.     At 3.30 p.m. sevenmen. Including Hannington, Currie, Cook and Bingleyprooeeded, in company with a police inspector to the outer gates of Buckingham Palace where they asked permission to present a petition to the King.     The Police Officer on duty refused permission and told them to present the petition through the Home Secretary.     Hannington statedin the Square that the text of the petition was:-&quot;His Ma jests- King george the fifth.   We, the undersigned elected representatives of the 2,000 unemployed who have marched to London, from England, . Scotland and Wales, representing Great Britain&apos;s unemployed, to interview the British Prime Minister, do most respectfully request you, to intervene on our behalf to secure the aforesaid interview, which has so far been refused.   Wc also anxiously request you to use your prerogative for the immediate reassembling of the British Parliament in order that they may introduce legislation of an effective character for tho immediate alleviation of the widespread suffering and destitution at present prevalent amongst your Majesty?s subjects throughout Great Britain as a result of unemployment.&quot;Extracts from speeches made in the Square are as undera-Siffleet;&quot;I say that when the futility of Parliament has been demonstrated, as I think it shortly will, it 1b the business of those men, Instead of telling unemployed men to make themselves a nuisance, they can leave that to us.    It is their business to gather up discontent in the length and breadth of the land, to call a national assembly or a peopled convention, call it what you like, that does not much matter.    Call this meeting, organise and mobilise the masses outside of the Constitution;   from that meeting form your Council of Action, and we will decide that if the Capitalist olass cannot cure unemployment with its welter of suffering, then we will cure it in our own fashion.&quot;Curries&quot;There is not the least doubt that if Parliament does not immediately reassemble and in 6 more serious manner than during the last Session deal with this question of unemployment in an effeotive manner there will be soveral Peterloos, there will be several uprisings of the working classes, there will he something approximating oiyil war in this oountry...&quot;Lansbury:&quot;Unemployed stick together, stand together. Don&quot;t come into conflict with well-fed, well-armed Police.   You have got plenty of opportunities to be anuisance/
- IS -auisanoe to Mayors, Councillors, Guardians and Members of parliament.   Keep worrying us.   Don&apos;t suffer in silence...&quot;Bobert Stewart:&quot;I am one of those wicked communists, a member of the Central Party of the Communist Party of Great Britain and proud of the fact, and I am proud to be able to say that never for one single minute has the Communist Party forgotten the existence of the unemployed or failed to render them overy conceivable assistance when they were able to give it...     If you want to be rid of unemployment there is only one way and that is to take the matter into your own hands, get rid of your masters, determine your own plans and your measures for producing things necessary to your welfare.    I want to say that if tho Communist ?ar*sy forgot the hunger marchers it would cease to fulfil the functions of tho Communist Party, for tho business of the Communist Party is to organise the workers of the world to take tho world for the workers...&quot;Gibson:&quot;If 1 wanted a riot in Sheffield, if I wanted a red plot, I could have one any time, but I realise with Carl Marx until you are better prepared until you aro better armed than the forces of the British State you will never beat the   British State*a.     We are just prosecuting tho last act of constitutionalism and if this last act of constitutionalism,, which by the way has been proclaimed by the authorities, they say we cannot go, fails, then we must adopt tact is a that will obtain our emancipation, never mind by what means...   Be inured with the spirit of revolution. Prepare for the revolution and the success of the working class is irrevocable.&quot;The following resolution, whioh resembles that adopted by meetings in various parts of the country, waspassed:-&quot;That this mass demonstration of employed and unemployed workers in conjunction with the national hunger marchers assembled in Trafalgar square, (Beoember 17th, reiterate our demand for Mr0 Bonar Law to receive the elected representatives of the hunge&apos;r marchers in order that they may state the grievances of the unemployed of England, Scotland and Wales, with a view to securing some immediate alleviation of the problem.   Furthermore, we consider that the prorogation of Parliament at a time such as this with millions in a state of destitution and poverty as a result of unemployment is not only bad Government, it is co*v? rdly and callous, and we pledge ourselves to oarry on a vigorous campaign to compel the reassembly of Parliament prior to February in order that the Government shall seriously tackle the problem of unemployment in a material and effective manner.&quot;About  15 was thrown on the plinth and Hannington stagedthat this money would be devoted to the activities of thdvfighting/

He was admitted to bail in his own recognizance of 40/-.   He appeared at the Police Court here this morning and was fined 10/-.   Munro stated that -3he sum of money found in his possession represented the proceeds of their collections, for which he acted as treasurer.&quot;Tho general opinion is that the men forming the Scottish contingents are of an extremely low type and the London leaders expect them to do &quot;big things&quot; when they arrive on or about Wow year&apos;s Eve.In connection with the visit of the Prime Minister to Glasgow to-morrow, the Executive Committee of the South West (Scotland) Distriot Council of Unemployed has asked all its local committees to organise a march of unemployed contingents into Glasgow to-day:   they intend to put forward the same demands as the men now in London.      The chief constable/
-17 - I      436Cons table of Glasgow informs me that:&quot;All the.outlying districts, greenock, Port Glasgow, Dumbarton, Stirling, and the mining villages in Lanarkshire, have promised to send in oontingents...   The Communists are undoubtedly organising this matter.   They use a good deal of bluff, but in this case I have a feeling that there are stronger elements than the usual unemployed leaders working in this instance.    The   Labour element, particularly the extreme section, have not yet come back to the normal after the Election V if there is such a thing as normal with regard to extremists - and the notoriety they received through the newspapers for their exhibition in Parliament   &apos; will no doubt encourage them to assist in making the annoyance to the Prime Minister as successful as possible, to show that they have the authority and : backing that they pretend.&quot;IRISH REVOLTED reactionary ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINHow the Irish in Great Britain regard events in Ireland Is, perhaps, host expressed in the words of one of them:   &quot;While we fear the worst, we hope for the best&quot;. They fear an outbreak of organised murder, followed by savage reprisals and ending in absolute anarchy.   They hope, and many of them firaly believe, the Free State will weather the storm and bring order out of chaos.Very little attention la paid to the peace talk, no one believes the Republicans will give in while they are able to obtain money or munitions and they appear to be well provided with both.From various reliable sources it is reported that the underground Republican activities in England and Scotland are on the increase.A new officer commanding for Great Britain has been appointed and urgent orders to units have been issued to obtain arms and ammunition.   He is a man from Cork and has brought with him as his staff several others from there upon whom he can rely.The entente with communists and extreme Labour men is developing:   there is an article by C.H. Norman in this week*s &quot;Communist&quot; on &quot;Murder Law in Ireland&quot; attacking the/
the Free State Government, and, in that of December 9th Saklatv&amp;la wrote in defence of the Republic.   Sean mcgrath in a recent letter to Mary McSwiney spoke of a consultation with the leaders of the communist league in London at which a very favourable understanding had been arrived at:   and Miss Barrett, one of Art 0&apos;Brien*s most trusted Lieutenants writing to a friejld in Dublin, said/ that friendly relations now exist with the real men of the English Labour Movement who saw how England had duped the Treaty perty.Dn December 16th Republican delegates from Dumbarton men at 171, Renfield Street and formed a District Council to take in Renfrewshire and Stirlingshire.   John Gorman of Dumbarton was elected President and Patrick Murphy of Clydebank, Vice-president.   These Councils are to be formed all over that part of Scotland covered by the Republican movement.The &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; of December 16th contains a full page article headed &quot;A little Theology for Theologians&quot; by Fesher Doyle.   The writer endeavours to prove that the action of Dr. Cohalan, Bishop of Cork,in refusing the sacraments to Republicans is wrong andgoes on to say:.nDr* Cohalan^s impudent arrogation to himaelf of a monopoly of our Church teaching has been duly treated with the well-bred coratempt which all such, stage-strutting invites.*^&quot;I do not pretend to be much of a Theologian myself.     But I do know something of our Church teaching and I want to teach Drtt Cohalan a little theology, and thereby (what he is never likely to learn) a little humanity.&quot;
