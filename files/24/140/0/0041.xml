ijjf^ 2,^4.341, &apos;      &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I circulate herewith a Memo rand ran, prepared by the Naval Staff in October last, showing the position as it then stood with regard to the serious delay in the oonstraction of the two Capital Ships which the Admiralty have always assumed we were by the Washington Treaty bound to lay down without delay, and which the law Officers have decided must be laid down, if at all, by the end of the calendar year.     I need not say that I concur wholeheartedly in the Memorandum.L* Stt Aa5th December l922eREIATM naval SgHBffffPHS AID JTHB 0H3. 2QWERi STANDARD.1b The policy of Ht,mcGovernment in regardto the naval strength of Great Britain is that our Pleat should be maintained at a One Power Standard, that is, on an equality with the naval power of the United States.Ett Under the Washington Treaty for thelimitation of naval armaments this standard of strength was adhered to in arriving at the composition of the fleets of Great Britain and the United States ^ and It was agreed that the retention by the Japanese of their1at est.se*.
latest battleship, the Miitsu, and the retention by the United States of their battleships the Maryland and the California, necessitated the commencement In 1982 of two new Capital Ships by Great Britain, in order to preserve the standard of relative naval strength contemplated,,3. It was accordingly laid down in the Treaty that*tha British Empire . may, in accordance with the re placemen1 table, construct two new Capital Ships not exceeding 35,000 tons standard displacement each&apos;1, it being added that these ships should be commenced In 1.922. 4. Despite repeated representations by the Boardof Admiralty of the weakness of oar naval position daring the actual building years of these ships, nothing has yet been done in the direction of commencement.     In fact, by a decision of the prime Minister conveyed in a letter from Sir John Chancel lor dated loth August 1922, the Board have been directed to suspend all work pending further consideration by a Committee presided, over by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,  and later by the Cabinet,-,5, The present position is in fact considerablyworse that that which obtained early in the year, owing to the fact that all Capital Ships belonging to Great Britain to be scrapped in accordance with the Washington Treaty had by October 1st 1922 been rendered useless for war purposes, and incapable of being reconstructed, with the exception of H.ii.3. Lion,
6.This action on our part was dictated partly by motives of economy, and partly with the desire of setting an example in carrying out the spirit as wall as the letter of the Washington Treaty, whioh actually laid down that the agreement would not take effect until the date of the deposit of the ratifications by all the Powers concerned07. . Unfortunately wo acted above.    The UnitedStates have made no move in the direction of scrapping any of their ships, with the exception of five of the very oldest, which would in any case have been condemnod as absolete, Treaty or no Treaty.-,that they have no intention of proceeding with scrapping until all ratifications have been deposited: whan Prance or Italy are likely to do this it is impossible to say8States ships to be scrapped, are vessels of the latest post-Jutland class, in the building stage, and embodying in their design all the lessons of the war. These ships remain in the same state in which they wore in in December 1921, and in the event of an emergency could be rapidly completed,    Their state of readiness at the moment is as follows -Further, our intelligence is to the of feetMeanwhile sthe more important of the UnitedWashingtonSouth DakotaIndianaMontanaForth CarolinaIowaMassachusetts32$ 38$ 28$ 37$ 32$ 11$76$ completed!note the above battleships are of 43s200 tons; twelve 16 iiir, , with the exception of the Washington, which is 32,600 tons, eight 16 in.Constellation

In regard to Japan also the same argumentapplies.     That Power has scrapped, in accordance with the Washington Agreement certain of the older classes of vessels, bat the two new post-Jutland ships, namely the Kaga and Tosa, which were building at private yards, have merely been transferred to Govern-ment yards, and have had armour placed on their sides with a view &quot;to using them as target ships for experimental purposes.     They could in an emergency be completed&quot;.   . 11. The Board of Admiralty feel bound to call theattention of the Cabinet to the Gravity of the naval situation outlined above.     It is their opinion that unless the continues delays hitherto imposed cease forth-with, the One Power Naval Standard policy of H.M. Government must bo definitely abandoned,   Parliament being informed that a lower standard of naval strength will in future be accepted,,12. It is therefore the duty of the Board ofAdmiralty:-(1)   To report to the Cabinet that by delaying the commencement- of the two new Capital Ships the naval strength of the Empire falls below that of the United States, and, having regard to geographical position and lack of bases for repair and fuel in Eastern waters, becomes inferior to that of Japan.(2)   To advise the Cabinet that the securityof the Empire in so far as it depends upon &apos; the Navy, is not, under these circumstances, adequately provided for.23$     completed
