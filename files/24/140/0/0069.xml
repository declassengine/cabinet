.    38?,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use,]POLITICAL.Decypher.   Lord Curzon (Lausanne)16th December, 1922.D. 11,55 a.m.    16th December, 1922.R. 12.30 p.m.   16th December, 1922.No. 125   (By Wireless)His Majesty&apos;s Government may like to know my idea of future procedure here,   1 have given up all hope of getting home for December 25th and am firmly resolved to stay at Lausanne until I get a treaty or fail.   I shall therefore, if my colleagues agree, only adjourn over December 24th and December 25th and then resume. I have hopes that sub-committees may conclude greater part of their work In the forthcoming week and that I can push through the Straits proposals at meeting of my commission on Monday,     Meanwhile I am drawing up in the form of a preliminary treaty conclusions at which we shall by then have arrived.     I cannot say that the Turks, owing to the tactics which they have persistently pursued, have actually accepted any of them although they must have general idea that from the majority of them we shall not consent to depart. This draft preliminary treaty will then be handed to them and I shall offer to discuss&apos; it article by article in Christmas week and shall invite- their acceptance (subject to such modifications as may have been found necessary) or reject instrument as a whole,I have no intention of conceding an adjournmentIn....CP.4369.j1
in order to admit of a reference of document line &quot;by-line to Angora which would I imagine he fatal.     If Ismet signs I shall make it quite clear to him that his signature involves acceptance by his government and that latter if they refuse it will lose treaty altogether.I believe such a preliminary treaty will be a complete Innovation in international practice.   But I see no other way of concluding a treaty within a reasonable space of time and our legal experts are prepared to grapple with anomaly.Should this treaty be signed by all parties then it will be put into final shape by draftsmen during January and we should have to meet again to sign final treaty later on,     It is this instrument which would have to be ratified by governments and parliaments concerned.Turks will no doubt demand immediate evacuation of allied troops upon signature of preliminary treaty.    This will have to be considered when demand is made and degree to which it would   be possible to meet it will require most careful examination.This is merely a general sketch of future as I now see it.     Later events may compel revision.Special Straits convention can probably be com-pleted in time for submission along with draft of preliminary treaty a week hence,   it is more than probable that Eussia will decline to sign in which case we shall have to do without her.It is of course possible that in anticipation of discussion of preliminary treaty struggle may be re-new ed on every point and Turks may break away.   Answer to this will depend partly upon extent of powers possessed by Ismet, still more upon their real desire for peace as opposed to renewal Of hostilities.
