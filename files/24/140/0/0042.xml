THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.9 6 66 0.cabinet.Copy No._l&amp;,S&apos;RATING REFORM. Memorandum by the Minister&apos; of Health.1.     As the Minister of Agriculture points out in his Memorandum of the 27th November (C.?. 4329) the Government have undertaken to inquire Into the subject of Agricultural Rating with a view to the removal of any unfairness which may be found to exist.2.     At present occupiers of agricultural land are assessed to certain rates on 25$ of the fall rateable value of their land (for sanitary expenses, etc. In towns and villages), on 33^/5$ to certain rates of very small amount -(-for lighting expenses in villages) and to all other rates on 50$ (for main roads and rural highways, police, schools, the poor, etc).       On the average this is equal to rating for all purposes on rather ovor 48$ in rural districts.3.     The case for the farmers may be stated as follows:-Occupiers of agricultural land, in proportion to their Income, pay a much greater share of local rates than any other ratepayers, since they are obliged to occupy so much rateable property In order to earn their living.     A farmer with 200 acres assessed at  200 may not earn more than a shopkeeper who is assessed at  30 per annum, yet he is paying on the Whole of his acreage.     The profits of the farmer and of the shopkeeper are probably just about the same on the average, but If the rates are 10/- In the pound, which Is less than the average in country districts, the farmer is paying in rates  50 a year, and the shopkeeperCjffiT.

 15.     It la true that the-farmer only pays half ther poundage-under the provisions of the Agricultural Rates Act, 1896* hut rates have gone up enormously since then and his present burden is intolerable, especially as the deficiency in the quota for1 the parish has to be made up by an Increased poundage.     The Act ot 1896 was based on the report of a Royal Commission which recommended that land should only pay a quarter of the poundage and that the whole remission should be borne by the Exchequer.     Agriculturalists are demanding that this recommendation should now be adopted.4.     The late Government had under consideration a scheme of Rating and Valuation Reform which was prepared in the Ministry of Health and approved, with some amendments, by a Cabinet Committee. (See C,P.3544).5.     This scheme of reform included inter alia a proposal for securing uniform deduotions in arriving,at the rateable value of various kinds of property, inoluding agricultural land.     The Committee were not concerned with the problem of affording greater relief to the agricultural ratepayer, but the scheme approved by them can readily be adapted to this purpose,&apos; and the possibility of giving agricultural land a uniform abatement which would bring the effective rateable value   down to (say) 33V3/fc or 25% has recently been very carefully explored.6.     There can be little doubt that relief of this kind would go far to meet the views of the farmers on the rating question, and the proposal that it should be effected by the machinery of the Rating and Valuation Reform Bill is, from several points of view, the most hopeful course to follow.7.     The two main points which would have to be faced, however, are (1) that the proposal, standing alone,
would involve a heavy transfer of &quot;burden to the non-agricultural ratepayer especially in the rural areas, and(2) that the urban ratepayer, who has had a long-standingSgrievance and in addition 1$ now groaning under the burdens occasioned by unemployment, would insist that his claims for relief are at least equally great.     Both of these classes of ratepayers would be content if the &quot;burdons referred to wore met by Exchequer Grants, but to meet their demands in this way, at any rate In whole, or In whole in the Immediate future, Is presumed to be out of the question.8.     On present figures a reduction of the assessable value of land to 255* of full rateable value would involve a loss of Income in the r&amp;ral and semi-rural districts of fully  3,000,000, but there is reason to believe that the reduction of rates now in progress would bring this loss of Income down to  f,500,000 in the near future.     If the relief be given as part of Rating and Valuation Reform, and if 25$ of gross annual value be taken as the basis of rating agricultural land, this loss would not exceed  2,000,000.     The corresponding figures for reduction to are  2,000,000,  1,700,000, and  1,400,000.9,     If this relief Is to be effected without any direct or indirect grant from the Exchequer it follows that there must be a readjustment between the various classes of ratepayers in tho country, and careful consideration has been given to a scheme for reserving a portion of the sums provided by Parliament In aid of Local Taxation for the purpose of assisting the poorer areas by means of what might be termed a Rate Equalisation Grant.     The primary measure for the distribution of such a grant, If basod upon ability to pay,
would be low assessable value per head of population, but it would also he necessary to take into account the abnormal expenditure in which particular local areas are involved, and to meet this by means of a weighting factor,I. For example in urban areas the number of smallhouses and tenements would probably provide an equitable guide for varying the formula of distribution in their favour.     An excessive proportion of small houses and tenements Increases the cost of local services to an extent greater than the contributions which they provide and, generally, it is where the number of small houses end tenements Is particularly high that unemployment presses most heavily and that ordinary poor relief end other forms of assistance make their heaviest claims,II. The heaviest charges on the rates in rural areas in respect of whloh the question of a weighting factor might arise are In respect of the maintenance of highways.The outstanding fact in regard to highway expenditure Is that whilst only 20 per cent, of the assessable value of England and Wales Is comprised In the rural areas, 78 per cent. (In mileage) of the highways are situate within those areas.     The charge for their maintenanoe la heavy and la very unequal as between the several rural districts, ranging In general (In the year 1920-21) from two to six shillings In the pound, If both the county charge (for main roads) and the district charge (for other roads) be included.     T:i some rural districts the charge for highway expenses was over elpht shillings in the pound in 1920-1921.
10.     There would, however, appear to be three importantreasons for postponing this scheme of a Rate Equalisation Granttill the Session of 1924. 1. The attainment of a uniform and reliable valuation of properties is a condition precedent to making grant distrl-bution dependent in any degree upon the factor of assessable value.     While the application of the principles of valuation Is left In the hands of local committees and the results vary as widely as they do, It would obviously be both unsound and Inequitable to use assessable values per head in connection with any grant distribution.11. The plan would Involve also a thorough revision of the system upon which Exchequer Grants are now distributed^ And such revision, which should Include abolition of the present &quot;Assigned Revenues system&quot; (a remnant of the scheme of 1838 which has lost almost all its meaning and purpose) and probably also an abolition of the stereotyped Agricultural Rates Grant, taken together with the Rating and Valuation Reforms, would probably be a programme of too great magnitude to be oarried out in the next.Session.Ill,Any attempt to bring In a scheme aiming at Rate Equalisation on these lines without some Increase In the total amount of Exchequer Grants would excite opposition and It would clearly be an advantage to postpone the Introduction of such a scheme until the effect of the reform of rating and valuation can be seen.11.     If it Is decided to postpone the revision of the Grant system and of the Assigned Revenue system In particular till 1924, the programme for next Session would be the Introduction of a general Rating and Valuation Reform Bill which would Inter alia secure the necessary uniformity of valuations and prepare the way for the revision of Looal Taxation Grants.     The other refc.iL-. which
this Bill would include are all such as would secure economy and * simplification together with greater efficiency of administration^ and there is evidence that they would ho highly appreciated by the more Important local authorities?: come of v/hom come to Parliament each Session to attain by a local Act sane of the advantages which this legislation would confer upon tho whole country..12.   This Bill might include a measure of relief to agricultural land by reducing the effective rateabio value- to an even 25% of gross rental for all rates, which would be equivalent to a reduction to 27 - 35$ of present rateable   values, or where the land is at present fully and truly valued, to about 27$ of rateable value.The effect of this would be immediate statutory recognition of the farmers&apos; claim to rating relief.     But-n assuming that the Bill passes next year, it would come into operation on the 1st of April, 1924, with the result that in the next financial year there would be (1) no question of an Exchequer grant, (2) no transfer of burden to other ratepayers, and (3) no actual relief to the fa^aners or to the heavily burdened urban ratepayers.It might j, however^ be possible to give specific promises to come to the aid of these other ratepayers in the following ways *To the ratepayers in the rural and semi-rural areas it might be possible to promise some relief in respect of their expenditure on the maintenance of highways other than main roads In cases where that expense at present Involves high rating.In the case of urban ratepayers it might be possible to promise assistance for rating authorities whose assessable values are low in proportion to their population or whose burdens are disproportionately heavy..13.   If, however, it Is considered essential that something shall be done in 1923 in ordor to assist the urban ratepayers and the non-agricultural ratepayers in rural districts at the same time as the farmers (i.e. in 1924-25), new Exchequer money must be found.     It might in that event be practicable to adopt
some such temporary expedient as was applied In 1887-88 In order to bridge over the time   necessary for the bringing Into operation of a comprehensive pormanent scheme, i*ew, a percentage addition night be made for one year to certain of the existing grants which it is proposed under the permanent scheme to abolish.    The most suitable grants to select for this purpose Ss involving the lea3t amount of legislation, no additional madhinery, and a smaller domand on tho Exchequer - would seem to be the grants of stereotyped amount at present made out of the Consolidated Fund to the councils of counties and county boroughs in compensation for the withdrawal from them of the actual annual produce of the liquor licence duties, the local taxation (customs and excise) duties, and the carriage licence duties,   together with the stereotyped grant under the Agricultural Rates Act, 1896, which Is also made out of the Consolidated Fund.   . The Local Authorities have long been demanding an increase of these stereotyped sums the total annual amount of which is  4,775,000.     It would probably be sufficient for the temporary purpose now aimed at if an Increase of 50$, or  2,388,000 were conceded.The advantage of this expedient would   be that it would leave the way open for revision of the Exchequer Grant system in the following session, though, even as a provisional errangement,It would to some extent increase the difficulties In the way of abolishing the Assigned Revenues system.The chief disadvantage of an automatic increase of 50 per cent would be that the relief would apply generally ajnd that it would not be of material assistance to the necessitous urban areas which are particularly hard hit by unemployment and in which the rating is at present at an almost intolerably high level.16*    An alternative, hut probably less satisfactory plan, would be that of Introducing a short Bill In the Session of 1923 reducing the effective rateable value of v- ? -
904(j uagricultural land to an even 25% of the rateable value now appearing in the Valuation Lists, this alteration to operate from such date as may be determined, namely the 1st of April, 1923, or the 1st of October; 1923, or tna 1st April, 1924,This redistribution of the rate charges in the administrative counties would, however, give too great and too just a cause of complaint to the other ratepayers in those areas unless a compensating grant is provided. The amount of this compensating grant would depend upon the date selected for the increased relief to the farmers. If the relief to the farmers were to operate as from 1st April, 1923, It Is estimated that an amount of fully  3,000,000 would be required to compensate the other ratepayers.     If the date selected were the 1st of October, 1923, it is estimated that half that amount would be required in respeot of the last six months of the year, 1923-24, If the farmers&apos; relief were to operate from the 1st of April, 1924, it is probable that owing to the general reduotion in rates which is anticipated the amount for a full year would be something less than  3,000^000.Purthermore. if such a compensating grant were made, a further grant, not smaller in amount, would almost inevitably be demanded by the necessitous urban areas..     .
