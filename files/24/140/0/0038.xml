THE PRESENT OOHDITtOR OF AGRICULTURE. Memorandum by the Chanoellor of the Exchequer *Before proceeding to discuss in detail the important proposals of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, I submit a few observations on the under-lying contention that agriculture occupies an exceptional position among industries in this country and has special claims for State assistance in a period of general depression such as we are unfortunately passing through at present.1. It is true that in the last 12 months there has been a great fall in agricultural prices, as instanced by the figures for wheat quoted by the Minister, but the high prioes of a year ago were themselves the result of a sudden rise and cannot be taken as a fair basis of reference.     The table below shews wheat prioes for the previous two years and for the last pre-War year.First week in September		December	I March1913-14	31/ 8*	31/2	31/61918-19	72/3	72/4	72/61919-80	73/4	72/7	72/71920-21	90/8	89/7	72/51921-22	62/?	46/3	51/9&apos;-&apos;- -From this it will be seen (a) that even in December last, wheat prices were still 60$ above 1913-14 level and (b) that there has been a marked rise since that date.Taking the prices of agricultural produoe as a whole and the average prioee for 1911-13 as 100, the index figure after rising to 297 in November, 1920, was still as high as 179 in January of this year.     On the revenue side of the account there are many industries that could show far greater difficulties at the present time.2.   JJor from the expenditure side is the position of agriculture one of exceptional difficulty.     The index figures (on the above basis) for fertilisers and feeding stuffs stood at 158 and 159 respectively in January, 1922, i,e, decidedly below the index figure for produGe.     Special reference is made by the Minister to the rise in rates, but rents on the other hand have not greatly increased (owing to the restriction in Section 8 of the Corn Production Act, 1917) and it is open to question whether rent and rates together would show a higher average index figure than 179 at the beginning of this year.     Wages are still high but judging from the reports in the Press the farmers are rapidly forcing them down, far more rapidly than employers in other industries who have powerful trade unions to oontend with.* Average for Sepiomber, 1913.
3.    It is common knowledge that farmers made very large profits during the War and up to last year but unlike manufacturers and traders they were not liable to exceSB profits duty.     They should therefore have been able to put by substantial sums to meet the period of depression which has now overtaken them.     Further large funds amounting in the aggregate to over  18,000,000 hav been provided recently by the State as a condition of its release from its unfortunate commitments under the Corn Production Acts,4, It will no doubt be urged that a large part of the farmers&apos; reserve funds and of the corn subsidy has gone to meet losses incurred in the past year of rapid re-adjustment of prioeBj   that some farmers had previously sunk most of their war profits in the purchase of their holdings, and that the process of re-adjustment of prices is not yet oomplete, though undoubtedly the worst trouble is over.     I think however that the foregoing observations go to show that the farmers difficulties at the present time are not more serious than those afflicting many of our great industries and that in- some respects he is in a more favourable position to meet them.     By all means let us do what is reasonably possible to remove any legitimate grievances he may have in the matter of taxation, national or local, but any measures of relief or assistance beyond this will constitute decidedly preferential treatment to the agricultural industry.     I do not on this ground necessarily rule out all such measures but I wish it to be clearly understood(a) that preferential treatment is involved whatever the justification for it;    and(b) that the taxpayer cannot possibly afford to embark afresh on a policy of subsidies to industry generally.Local Rates.At the outset of my remarks on this part of the memorandum of the Minister of Agriculture, 1 must register my emphatic dissent from his proposal that any re-adjustment of the burden of rating on agricultural land or tithe must be effected by means of an Exchequer grent.     The proper functions of Exchequer grants to local authorities were very fully considered by the Local Taxation Committee of 1911-14 and may be briefly stated as follows(a) to afford an equitable adjustment between the nation as a whole and the members of each self-governing community of the cost of those Services administered locally which are of interest to the nation as a whole eig. education, police etc.     These services the Committee termed &quot;semi-national&quot;  in that they formed a group intermediate between the services of purely national interest administered by the Central Government and locally administered services of purely local interest such as street lighting and cleanings(b) to give the nation as a whole through the Central Government some control over the administration of these semi-national services by each community5(c) by means of suitable adjustments in the amounts of the grants to correct to some extent the inequalities of burden as between one community and another involved in the looal administration of these servic es.
It is commonly urged as an additional argument in favour of the grants for semi-national services that the inequalities of local rating as between individuals are pro tanto reduced, but the amounts to which these grants can properly be increased are strictly limited both by the necessity of preserving economy in local administration and also by the present condition of the national finances and in practice little weight can be attached to this con-sideration,I think that I am correct in saying that with two important exceptions all Government grants to local authorities in recent years have been given on the above principles;   the two exceptions being the grants under the Agricultural Rates Act 1896 and those under the Tithe Rentcharge (Rates) Act 1899.     As these are expressly referred to by the Minister of Agriculture it is necessary to explain them in detail.The former Act relieved agricultural land of one-half of its liability to all rates for which it was not already entitled to a greater abatement and a fixed grant was given to all local authorities to make good the immediate loss involved, but no attempt was made to adjust the grant to future variations in rat es.The similar relief to the clergy in 1899 on the other hand was effected by directing the rate collector to send the demand for one-half of the rates on the tithe attached to a benefice to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue who were to pay it out of moneys earmarked for transfer to the Local Taxation Account. i.e. the latter grant is not really a charge upon the Exchequer but upon County rates. .The Local Taxation Committee strongly criticised both grants as not being given on the principles set out above.     Their view was that after the cost of semi-national services in an area had been duly apportioned between the State  . and the locality on the lines indicated above, the remaining expenses of local government were a proper charge on the local community, and whatever was the principle of apportionment among the members of the community, there was no further legitimate claim upon the Exchequer,     Or to put the matter more simply, f when the State has paid its proper share of the cost of education, main roads, police, etc, in an area, it is not its business to find money to relieve the &quot; farmer or the clergyman or the shopkeeper or the cottager.     If the farmer is too heavily burdended, the other members of the community are not paying their share.I desire most emphatically to endorse the view and I feel that my responsibilities as Chancellor of the Exchequer really end here so far as the  - j rating of agricultural land is concerned, and that the proper adjustment of the &apos; local rating system is more a matter for the Minister of Health.     My pre-predecessors and I have found, however, from bitter experience that a satisfactory settlement of this grievance of the farmers is so essential to the avoidance of recurrent demands on the Exchequer for subsidies that I am constrained to add a few observations on the local aspects of this matter.it ljIf we were starting with a clean sheet to devise a scheme of local rating !J.[there would be much to be said on grounds of rough justice for relieving the I farmer altogether of rates on his fields   leaving him only liable for rates on   I
his home and  ana buildings.     The land has however been burdened with rates for some 300 years and this liability haa operated to reduce the value of it both on a capital and on a rental basis.     To a very large extent therefore the rate liability is in the nature of a rent oharge on the land and in this respect resembles tithe.     In fact had rates remained stationery in amount there would have been no more case for relieving the land from this burden than from the liability to tithe or land tax.     Unfortunately rates have increased rapidly in reoent years and as regards this increase it must be admitted that the historical justification of the heavy charge upon the farmer breaks down. The following table gives the average rates in the   in rural districts at various dates since 1800:-1803		4.6K	1813-5			1817		3.1C&amp;	1827		3.8	1868		2.7	1890-1		Z.2H	1893-4		2.3	1896-8		2.10	Buildings etc.			Agric. land (approx.)1898-9	I:	d 7.2	s. d 1. 3.61903.4	3.	9.4	1.10.71908-9	4.	3.0	2. 1.51913-4	5.	0.4	2. 6.21914-5	5.	3.1	2. 7.5These figures shew that even before the War the rates on agricultural land had increased sufficiently to wipe out the relief given in 1896.     Since then the general level of rates has approximately doubled though a considerable reduction below this high level may be anticipated in the near future as rateable values and expenditure again reach a corresponding economic level.This heavy increase has all been borne by the landowner and the farmer together, but the extent to which the farmer himself has suffered is largely a matter of conjecture.     In the prosperous times of the War the landowner was undoubtedly bearing the burden for his rents were still below the economic value of the land, but in the conditions to be expected in the next few years this value is likely to be little in exoess of the pre-war level, and the burden of rates will undoubtedly again press heavily upon the farmer. In these circumstances, I should not regard the proposal of the Minister of Agriculture to reduce the rateability of agricultural land to one third,  , instead of one half, as unduly generous, but, as 1 have stated above, this must be done by a re-adjustment of local burdens and not by a special Gov er nm ent gra nt.The proposed Valuation and Rating Reform Bill would provide an excellent opportunity for making this alteration.     as the Bill stands at present the burden of rates on the farmer will be generally increased.     In the first place the Bill substitutes in rural areas a uniform abatement of 50$ on all rates for the. present abatements averaging 51.2$, but - what is far more
important * it provides machinery for placing   all rateable valuations on a uniform and accurate basis.It is common knowledge that the influenoe of farmers with rural assess-ment committees has enabled this class hitherto in most cases to keep their assessments below the proper   figures.     In view of this it would not, I think, be unreasonable to fix the uniform abatement on agricultural land in rural areac in future at 75$, with a corresponding adjustment on the figures for urban areas.     This concession while giving much needed relief to the farmers would also go far to remove one of the most serious obstacles to the passage of the Bill.In suggesting that any such abatement to the farmer, unless coupled by an equivalent Exchequer grant, would throw an excessive burden upon other ratepayers in the same parish, the Minister has not I think made allowance for the very large extent to which services in rural areas have become a County Charge.     Particularly is this true of the services which have caused the heaviest increases of expenditure in recent years viz. education, police and main roads.     Consequently the greater part of the cost of the proposed relief to agriculture would be spread over the Administrative County.     Of the remainder all but an insignificant portion would be spread over the Union, which, however rural, generally includes an urban element and the resultant increase in the total rates in any area should not be at all considerable. But whatever the aotual inorease the result would be a more equitable dis-tribution among the ratepayers of the burdens properly chargeable on them.Rates on Tithe Rentcharfte, The Tithe ^entcharge (Rates) Act, 1920, was the result of a deputation received by my predecessor.     The proposal of the Treasury was to throw the loss involved in stereotyping the rates on tithe until 1926 on to the County rates in order to avoid the heavy increases of rates which an adjustment on a parochial basis would entail in parishes with a large tithe, but this proposal was abandoned for the simpler but less equitable process of making the excess rates over the stereotyped figure irrecoverable.     During the passage of the Bill the loss to be met was increased by the total or partial exemption of small tithe income.     The latter concession by mixing up rating liability with questions of total income has greatly increased the difficulty of dealing with the matter on any logical basis.For the reasons indicated above in my remarks on the rating of agriculi tural land, I must firmly oppose the proposal of the Minister of Agriculture to meet the Iobs of rates involved in this Act by an Exchequer grant.     The existing grievances will be well met by the proposals on the Valuation and Rating Reform Bill:-(a) that the District shall be the rating area instead of the Parish;(b) that precepts from County authorities shall not be, as at present, fora defined amount calculated on the total assessable value of the parish, (which would include the full value of the tithe rent.oharge although part of it may under the Act of 1920 be unproductive), but shall be for the produce of a rate of definite poundage.It must however be remembered that the Act of 1920 is only a temporary
measure, to operate until 1926 when tithe again becomes variable, and moreover that the Act only applies to clerical tithe.     As a permanent solution of the vexed question of the rating of tithe 1 would advocate treating all tithe in the same way as is recommended above for agricultural land.Income Tax.Before the War the farmer was taxed on one-third of his rent but no one with any knowledge of farmers would suggest that on a farm with a rent of  300 per annum the true average income of the farmer inoluding the value of him house and garden, of the farm produce consumed by himself and hin family, of the services of his servants, horses, vehicles etc, for other than purely farming operations only amounted to  100 per annum.     In fact the gross injustice of this low assessment was I consider only tolerated because the farmer was rated so heavily.If now the rating liability of the farmer is to be placed on an equitable basis, the ground for specially favourable treatment in taxation disappears. It will, I think, be generally agreed that on a pre-War basis the true income of a farmer was on the average very much in excess of one-third of his rent. The bulk of the farmers&apos; accounts for the current Income Tax year are not yet available and it may prove to be the case that for 1921-22 the statutory basis of twice the annual value has been excessive as compared with the average run of farming profits.     But&apos;&apos;I would point out that this basis is only a maximum and the farmer has .two alternatives.    In the first place a farmer who in fact makes no profit, or less profit than- he is assumed to make, can get his assess-ment reduced to the amount of his actual profits.     The Royal Commission on Income Tax summarised the farmer&apos;s position in the following wordsj-&quot;When a good year comes the farmer pays on his conventional Schedule H assessment though his profits may greatly exceed that amount.     When a bad year comes and his profits are less than the assumed profit he invokes the remedial provision and pays only on his real income.   He has therefore an option which is not enjoyed by any other class, of paying for any year either on the assumed profit or on the real profit, whichever is the smaller.&quot; (Paragraph 447 of the Report).I cannot admit the suggestion of the Minister of Agriculture that it is impossible, or, indeed, even very difficult for a&apos;  farmer, who has not in-fact kept proper accounts, to obtain any adjustment whatever of the Income Tax, Schedule B charge upon him.     Plainly he is at some disadvantage as compared with the farmer who has complete and proper accounts,. for the latter has only to hand in those accounts and obtain his relief, but, even in the former case, if the farmer has retained say, his bills and receipts and will produce them with his bank books and records of stock so far as can be obtained, he will    t always find the Inspector of Taxes ready to assiBt him in arriving at an approximate computation of his farming.results for the year with a view to a reasonable adjustment of the Income Tax charge.       And, even if this course should prove impracticable, the farmer would still be left with the right to state his case personally to the Distriot Commissioners, who would be in a position to bring their knowledge of local conditions and the results shewn by the accounts from other farmers in the neighbourhood to bear upon the faots of the appellant&apos;s case.and thus be able to make a reasonable approximate
?Madjustment of his Income Tax liability&apos;.Secondly, there is a statutory provision under which any farmer can elect to be assessed under Schedule D. instead of Schedule B., in which case the Income Tax assessment is based upon the average of the actual farming profits of the three preceding years.     At present the number of cases in which this election is made is very small indeed) and in view of the gloomy predictions as to the prospects of agriculture in.this country, it may reasonably be expected   that the number of such elections for Schedule Da assessment for the coming year 1922-23 will be deduced to a minimuim     It would be obviously to the disadvantage of a farmer to pay Income Tax for 1922-23 on the average of the three years 1919, 1920 and 1921 (two of which were good farming years) as an alternative to assessment under Schedule B on the statutory basis, coupled with the right (which he has) to a reduction of that Schedule B assessment down to the amount of the actual profitB, if any, of the year 1922-23.     For these reasons I should hesitate to advise any compulsory transfer&quot; of assessments upon farmers from Schedule B to Schedule D at the present time.     Such a course would require a Resolution, and it could hardly fail to excite strong opposition.Credit.I agree with the Minister that there is need for better credit facilities than at present exist for farmers, who are not as a class able to provide the kind of collateral security which the Joint Stock Banks demand.     But I am very strongly opposed to the suggestion that such facilities should be provided by some scheme for a State guarantee for bank overdrafts,     I see no justification for singling out a particular industry such as agriculture, however important for spoon-feeding by the Exchequer.     As I have already pointed out, there is reason to believe that on the whole other industries have been much more severe sufferers from the period of catastrophic price fluctuations through which we have passed.     If we embarked on a system of State guarantees for agricultural credit, we should be quickly driven into wholesale guarantees for British industry in every direction, a policy which would be equally fatal to the Exchequer and to the spirit of enterprise and self-reliance on whioh British industry has been built up.Further it is unconscionable that the banks should be rewarded for their short-comings in assisting agricultural credit by being paid a handsome rate of interest, well in excess of what they expect to earn from ordinary trade advances, for lending money to farmers without risk to themselves.The problem of agricultural credit is a   difficult  one and requires deeper study and some more far-reaching remedies than the fatally easy plan of State guarantees.     It is&apos; probably true to say that the development of British banking in the last fifty years has been in a direction which has resulted in continuously increasing inattention to the needs of the farmer,     In dealing with the farmer, more than with any other class of the community, it is his personal credit whioh the banker should study and build upon.     But the gradual absorption of the smaller County banks into a few large banks with their head-quarters in London has tended to an increasing ignorance and negleot of the farmers special aharact eristics and needs,     No doubt there are still many
good local branch managers who know their farmer clients personally and cater for their requirements.     But the spirit of large joint stock banking is adverse, and tends to lay too much stress on collateral security.How oan this defect in British banking best be remedied?     Surely not by a State guarantee to the hankers to encourage them in the very habits which are responsible for defect.     In my view, the most hopeful line of progress lies in an encouragement of the principles of co-operative credit and the establishment of Agricultural Credit Banks.     This remedy is largely in the hand of the   farmers themselves, but they are a conservative class who are not easily persuaded into adopting and pushing new-fangled ideas.     If the principles of co-operative credit are to win their way, they will need strong encouragement from without.     Considerable opposition must be expected from the bankers, and the unpopularity of unlimited liability which is an essential feature of most of the successful experiments which other countries have made in establishing Go-operative Credit Banks for Agriculture, must be reckoned with and overcome.     On the other hand the recent large increase in the number of owner-farmers should help to stimulate a movement which is designed to meet the needs of this class in a special degree.1 should be very ready to consider some means for temporary State assistance for Agricultural Credit Banks during the early years of their establishment.     For example., it might be found possible to adopt for the special needs of rural areas the plan of using monies raised by National Savings Certificates through the local Loans Fund for financing local capital expenditure, which was inaugurated in 1920 in connection with housing Finance.I am not in a position to make any specific or detailed proposals at this stage.     It would be necessary to have the whole subjeot explored by a strong Committee or Commission.     But I wish to put the general idea forward as a constructive suggestion for dealing with the problem of agricultural credit.In conclusion, I would draw attention to the useful material provided by the Report and Minutes of Evidence of the Select Oommittee of the House of Lords on the Thrift and Credits Bank Bill introduced in 1910 by Lord Shaftesbury (House of Lords 96 of 1910), which declared (Seotion 13 of Report)that&quot;The Committee after consideration of the whole subject have formed a clear opinion that Thrift and Credit Banks constituted on the foregoing lines will be of great service to the classes whose wants they are intended to meet, and they therefore suggest that the matter should receive the favourable attention of the Legislature.&quot;R .
