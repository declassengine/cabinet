December, 1922C A B I NET.t,554. XJWMPLOYMF &quot;IT - ARTERIAL Copy No&apos; ROADS.Note by the Minister of Health.^ith reference to Item 2 on the Agenda for tomorrows Cabinet Meeting I circulate to my colleagues a report of the Unemployment Committee on Arterial roads and should be glad of the approval of the Cabinet to their re commendation.A.G.B..
1;        The Cabinet Committee on Unemployment coneidered at a meeting held on Monday 11th December, 1923, the proposals submitted by the Ministry of Transport for the execution of certain additional road works*   It will be remembered that the Cabinet postponed for further consideration the proposal originally endorsed by the Committee that schemes involving further expenditure of  6,000,000 On arterial road development at an estimated cost to the Exchequer,, apart from the Road Fund, of  1,500,000 should be under-taken.   The ground for this postponement was that the schemes could not be put in operation in time to relieve unemployment this winter.2. On the 11th December tho Minister of Transport reported that two new arterial roads, namely,(a) a now road about 6 miles in length from Pur-fleet to Tilbury, estimated to cost  275,000 and(b) the Sidcup By-Pass Road, an extension of the Eltham By-Pass, estimated to cost  162,000,could be put in hand within a very few weeks   that the London County Council had. agreed to contribute one-fourth of the cost (not exceeding  110,000) provided that orjy London unemployed     should be engaged upon the work, and that the Essex County Council had agreed to contribute 50^ of the cost ( 18,000) of acquiring the land for the road (a).3.     The terms of the offer made by the London County Council involve the defrayment of the remaining 75% of the cost by the Road Fund (50$) and by the Exchequer.   These terms are the same as those on which the County Council had contributed to similar works last winter. 4..      It was felt by the Committee that, as the County Council had. been fully warranted in assuming that the arrangement made last winter was still open to them and as thework/
work could be put In hand early In the new year, it was right that these works and the Treasury contribu-tion proposed, should be recommended for the approval of the Cabinet.5.       It was left to the Minister of Transport to submit for consideration, as occasion offered, such further proposals as might be capable of a very early start. 6.       It was further represented by the Minister of Transport that, in order to obviate the necessity for the Exchequer to find fresh money for those works a sum of  540,000 provided in the Road Grants Unemploy-ment Relief Vote 1922-23 might be surrendered, thereby raising the Road Fund Contribution to the 1920-21 programme up to the normal 50$ as from the 1st April 1922, provided that the Treasury agree to re-vote thi3 sum or the due proportion of it in the shape of Exchequer contributions to a new programme of road work to cost in all  2,000,000 and to inc3.ude the works specified in paragraph 2*7. It was .decided hy the Committee that no large programme such as was suggested should be recommended for adoption at the present time on the ground specified in the Cabinet decision already mentioned but that the financial arrangement proposed by the Minister of Transport should be applied to the two roads, the construction of which is recommended in this report. 8,     The re a emendation of the Committee therefore is that the Minister cf Transport he authorised to proceed with the construction of the Purfleet-Tilbury Road and the Sidcup By-Pass Road and to contribute 50 N of the cost from the Road Fund, that the Treasury be authorised to contribute up to 25?&apos; of the cost, the balance being obtained from the local authorities, and that theTreasury/
Treasury contribution be found by the surrender of a sufficient amount from the Exchequer money already provided for the Ministry of Transport on the under-standing that a similar sum is to be re-voted in the coming financial yeareSigned on behalf of the Committee, Arthur C, Boscawen Chairman..aSoFrancis )      Joint.)Secretaries.
