(THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS ERI TAB NIC MAJESTYJS GOVERNMENT.)if idential *,P.4572.CABINET.T desire to submit the following memorandum for the consideration of the Cabinet.G-.  C.  TRYCN.Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions. 1.      I am under the necessity of asking the consideration of the Cabinet on a point of importance to ex-service officers and men which is raised by thethe Minister of Labour) of the Standing Joint Committee, the continued working Of which.is seriously threatened in the absence of a settlement of this question.2.      The Standing Joint Committee&apos; was formed (at the instance of the late Prime Minister)  in February, 1920, under the Chairmanship of the Ministers  of Pensions and of Labour, along with representatives of the ex-service organisations, in order to assist organisations of ex-officers and ex-service men in their task of securing to their members and to ex-service men of His Majesty1s Forces generally, full information as to the rights and privileges conferred upon them by the Crown and Parliament, and the enjoyment of such rights and privileges, and to provide machinery for consultation between the Government and ex-members of His Majesty1s Forces, upon questions affecting ex.-servioe officers and men and. their dependants,, The War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry each send a junior official as representative,,        The mattersStanding Joint Committee for Ex-Service Questions.British Legion.I do so as Chairman(jointly withdiscussed
discussed on the Standing Joint- Committee, which meets at regular intervals, have, until recently, been (as was natural in the circumstances)  questions affecting ex-service officers and men of the Great War.        But latterly, questions affecting ex-service men of the post-War service have been brought up,        The War Office have, however, contended that post-War questions are outside the scope of the Joint Committee, and discussion has accordingly been declinedc       The representatives of ex-service men protested against this attitude, and the matter has been debated at intervals for about one year.       A compromise has been working in so far as some cases or questions, not definitely raised as post-War matters, have been discussed and further discussion has stopped only when it appeared that they affected post-War policy or practice.       At a recent meeting,  the question, however, came to a head, and the representatives of the Eritish Legion (which is now the only ex-service organisation represented on the Committee) intimated that in the absence of a prompt decision,  they would feel obliged, in the interests of their members, to bring the issue directly before the Prime Minister. To meet the difficulty, I undertook, as Chairman of the Joint Committee, to bring the matter before the Cabinet,3,      The contention of the British Legion,  on behalf of ex-service men, is that the terms of constitution of the Joint Committee cover all ex-service questions and in no way rule out questions of post-War, as distinct from Creat War, service.       Whether or not it was directly contemplated at the time that post-War questions should, be discussed, I am not in a position to say, but on the issue whether the Joint Committee as at present constituted should discvisssuch
9 Q Qsuch questions, I, as Minister of Pensions, see great difficulty in the way of an affirmative answer. Since the original constitution of the Commit tee, the Minister,of Pensions has, by the War Pensions Act, 1920, been relieved of responsibility for the administration of all pensions except those of the Great Yfar ana previous Wars.       It is the object of the Joint Committee that the representatives of ex-service men should be able to receive authoritative information or an authoritative promise of consideration for a grievance,  on ex-service questions,        But with a Committee presided over by the Ministers of Pensions and Labour,  on post-War questions this can no longer be the case, and as Chairman of the Committee, I feel that I may be placed in a position, of serious difficulty in the event of acute differences arising as to the action or Regulations of one or other of the Service Departments, which may come up for discussion at a meeting of the Joint Committee.        If the ex-service men were prepared to accept a temporary compromise I would, of course do my best to make It work.,        But in my opinion, if the Government consider that ex-service questions generally. Including questions of the post-war service, should be open to discussion in Committee,  the constitution of the present Committee should be altered.4..     I therefore beg to report the difficulty to the Cabinet with a view to an early decision being obtained.        The matter is doubtless one on which the Government will desire to obtain the views of the First Lord of the Admiralty,  the Secretary of State for War, and. the Secretary of State for Air, who, together with the Minister of Labour are I understand submitting their views  to the Cabinet.Ministry of Pensions./ 21st December, .1922*-.
