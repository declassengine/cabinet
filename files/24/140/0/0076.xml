0 A B I -K E. T..PLAN FOR GENERAL SETTLEMENT OF &apos;..REPARATION AND- EUROPEAN INTER ALLIEB JS3TSSUMMARY.1&apos;a ration.The following plan has &quot;been prepared as a complete and final settlement of Reparations and European Inter-Allied Debt.The German obligations under the Peace Treaty are fixed by the plan at    -Nil for 4 years (apart from certain deliveries in -kind for which credit, is to be given against future -payments)..2 milliard gold marks.( 100 millions) per annum for the next 4 years. 2-g milliard gold, marks ( 125 millions) per annum for the following 2 years, after 10 years    at 3, l/3rd milliards ( 166 millions) or such smaller sum (not less than.       milliards) as may be fixed by an impartial tribunal. If the supervising authority provided for be Brow decided, unanimously that the state of German finances before the end of the initial period of four yesrs is siwh that cash payments for reparation can be -made, it will have power to ante-date the oommenaement. -of the annual payment of 2 milliards by such period not exceeding two years as it may see fit and. to make such adjustments in respect&apos; of future payments as it may seem to be equitable - so as to secure that the toWl liability shall not be increased..l;.-.tr:;&apos;.:.;&apos;: /ThO&apos;H
The dbli..gat.i ons    take the form of 5 pear .oent,.horids redeemable at call by the. .Gerran Government - at the outset on very easy termsgradually rising to par to at the end of 32 years.The bonds are divided into..&quot;two series, Series I representing the fixed payment (rising to 2-J- milliards, per annum) Series II representing&apos; the additional; payments over and above 2q milliards per annum from the,eleventh year onwards.:,.v    -There is no sinking fund but redemption, more especially in the earlier years, is permitted upon such liberal terms that the.saving in annual interest on the bonds redeemed will, if German credit is re-established, be sufficient to cover both interest and sinking fund on German loans, raised in the market for redemption purposessThis arrangement gives Germany a strong inducement to raise such loans as soon as possible since she will thereby convert a perpetual into a terminable obligation without   &apos; increase of the annual charge and also substitute a normal foreign debt to. private Bondholders for.her present obliga-. tions to foreign Governments.The bonds provided for in the scheme are not intended either to be issued to the public or placed on the market.      They are to serve merely as accounting machinery, The &quot;Mobilisation&quot;  of the German reparation debt is to be effected by loans raised by Germany from the public, the proceeds of which would be applied to the redemption of the original bonds.In order to give Germany a real&apos; chance of restoring budget equilibrium and stabilising the mark, it is absolutely essential that she should be given complete, freedom from pay-ments in foreign currencies&apos; during &apos;the initial period and that deliveries in kind (except in so far as the receiving countries may be willing to pay cosh for them)  should be reduced to a minirmmir
It will however be. necessary that the deliveries of coke to&apos; France,  ooal to Italy and possibly dye-stuffs cn reparation account should be continued/though upon a reduced scale, everi during this initial period.     The precise quantities can only be settled by negotiations . -      &apos; --&apos;        ;In the event of the plan proving successful, it is highly probable, however,  that Germany would herself.seek to inorease her deliveries in kind in tho early yeais to a maximum,  in view of the liberal terms on which the value is applied to the cancellation of her debt.-,     . The&apos;plan.would be offered toGsr-many on condition that she undertakes :- . &apos;.(1) to stabilise the mark in accordance with the recommendations contained in the majority report of the Foreign Experts consulted&apos; by the German Government in November last and to restore budget equilibrium with limits of time to be prescribed (say 6 months for the staTHisation . and 2 years for the budget reform).(2) To accept such financial supervision as may be deemed by the Allied Powers to be necessary to see to the punctual carrying out of these-reforms  (See Note).(5) To submit, In the event of her failing to satisfy the supervising authority that condition (l) is being observed or failing to discharge hsr obligations as now revised, to any measures which the Allied Powers upon an unanimous report cf such failure from the&apos; supervising authority may unanimously decide to be necessary including forcible seizure of German revenues and assets and military occupation ef German territories outside the existing zone of occupation.

Bunervi oi on of German Fin-uice^The stimulus which real hope of a peaceful settlement will undoubtedly give, to German initiative^ re-inforoed by the controls which the German Government-will inevitably have to accept on behalf of foreign bondholders, when it begins to raise external loans, will greatly diminish,., the -necessity for measures of direct control by the Allied Governments, and there ipmuch to be said on merits for abandoning the idea of such direct control altogetheroSuch a policy is. not likely, ..however, to commend Itself to France and it will be necessary to establish machinery for effective supervision of German financial legislation and administration on behalf of the Allies at any rate until the time when the paw arrangements have come   into full operation and Germany is regularly discharging her reparation obligations.It is proposed that a Foreign Finance Council should be set up with its seat in Berlin.The Council will consist of persons appointed by Great Britain, France, Belgium and Italy with two other members of American and Neutral European nationality respectively. The German Finance Minister will be ex-official Chairman and will be required by law to act on the Council&apos;e advice in regard to all matters affeotingi--&apos;1)     Currency legislation.(S)     The Budget, Fiscal legislation and Public expenditure *(3)     General Treasury Administration.(jkj,     Financial prohibitions, Control of &apos;.   Foreign \ remittances etc.,this, of course, means a considerable measure of interference with German democratic Independence in matters offinance, but such interference is the inevitable concomitant, of anany method of effective supervision or control.The ....
The association of the Finance Minister with the Council seems to he the only method by which foreign Inter-ference   can be squared with the democratic machinery.The combination, though it cannot be expected to work without friction, is not necessarily an unpromising one as a constitutional experiment, seeing that in the event of serious differences of opinion between the Minister and the Council the former could always have recourse to resignation -a step which might place the Council in considerable difficulties, if he had a good case.       There would therefore be elements which would make for reasonable compromise.As regards the powers of the Council the main object to be aimed at - and here a large section of Trench opinion is in agreement - is to leave German administration as far as possible in German hands,  and avoid direct respon--eibility for initiative in regard to details in the matter of legislation.It is desirable to give the Council very wide powers but also wide discretion as to both the manner in which and the extent to. which they are to be used.It is not practicable to lay down beforehand any rigid rules inregard to such matters as the further degree of.expansion of the note issue which can be permitted or the further increase which may be allowed to take place in the floating debt -   still less to insist on the raising of loans -the possibility of which depends on finding lenders.The great danger of course is that control imposed from without runs great risk of being unsatisfactory in the financial results - partly by reason of want of intimate knowledge and partly by reason of the inevitable friction -while the more complete the control the greater becomes theresponsibility
responsibility of the controlling authority for the results obtained, whatever they may be.&apos;Whatever form .of local control may be decided&apos;upon it should be responsible and Independent i.e.&apos; not subject to a Reparation Commission sitting in Paris.: 1 IT,&apos; in deference to French wishes the Reparation Commission :has; to be retained&quot;&apos;&apos; &apos; it should be deprived entirely&quot;of its executive functions -and become a -purely judicial body which might meet-&apos; (say) -once- a quarter and adjourn as eo&quot;6h as the &quot;cases&quot; on&apos;the list at each se-aeion have been disposed of.&quot;If&quot;this arrangement&apos;is adopted it would be necessary to provide that the. Council&apos; Should sit Without the German Finance Minister whenever occasion requires to exercise those of the executive powers of the Reparation&apos; Commission and of the existing Committee of Guarantees which It is necessary&apos; to maintain. - , .
PLAN FOR GENERAL SETTLEMENT OF REPARATION AND    ,. EUROPEAN INTERALLIED DEBTS.-REPARATION. ,1. The existing German Bonds of Series A.B. and C. to be cancelled and the Schedule of Payments annuities to bs reduced to the amounts required year by year to-provide the interest/ payable on the new bonds to be issued under paragraph 2. 2. Germany to issue to the Reparation Commission new bondsto be divided into two series.(a) 1st Series Bonds to the amount of 50 milliard gold marks to be issued forthwith repayable at par on the 31st December 1954 and bearing interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum payable half yearly: the interest to be suspended in Its entirety for the first four years (until 1st January 1927) and to the extent of 1 per cent per annum for the next four years (until 1st January, 1931).(b) 2nd Series   Bonds to the amount of 17.31 milliard gold marks  (being the amount of the deferred interest on the bonds of the 1st series compounded at 5fu to 1st April 1933) or such lesser amount (if any) as the arbitral Tribunal pro-viced for in pars;. 3 may determine, to be iseuec. on 1st ^pril 1933, repayable at par on the 31st Maroh 1965 and bearing interest at 5$ por annum payable half yearly.3.      If before 1st April 1933 Germany proves to the satisfaction of an Arbitral Tribunal ths.-t the payments required to meet the interest upon the 2nd Series of bonds exceed her * capacity, her obligation to issue suoh bonds to be cancelled in whole or in part as the tribunal may decide.
The Arbitral Tribunal to be appointed upon application by the German Government, to be made not later than 1st October 1932. and to consist of one person /nominated by the Reparation Commission,  one person nominated by the German Government and a third&apos; by agreement between the other. two or in default, of agreement by the President cf the United Ststes of America.-.&apos;&apos;4.   The bonds issued and to be issued under paragraph 2 to&apos; be accepted by the Allied Governments in commutation of all financial liabilities of the German Government remaining undischarged on 31st December 1922 under the Treaty.of   &apos; Versailles to Powers which have ratified that Treaty including:.all liabilities under agreements&apos;With particular&apos; Powers, in-commutation of Treaty obligations but excluding   . &apos; the Treasury Bills,Issued to. Belgium in respect of the last five, instalments of the cash payments due in&apos; 1922. &apos;. Germany. to. pay at. maturity the -Bills issued to Belgium in respect of t he first two of these five instalments, those - &apos;&apos; issued in, respect of the remaining three, instalments to be cancelled-and the amounts thereof re-credited to Belgium.--:&apos;-.^&apos;Treaty obligations&apos; to make deliveries of coal,  dyestuffs, timber,  etc.,  to continue subject to the various conditions in regard&apos; to quantities and prices laid down in the Treaty. Such deliveries (in so far as they may exceed new annual maxima to be agreed) to be paid for by the respective receiving Powers in cash, unless otherwise agreed between Germany and the Power concerned,    all deliveries within the new annual maxima or which may be made the -subject of such special agreement to be paid for by the receiving Power by set off against the interest, receivable upon the bondis held by it or (until such interest payments have begun or in so far as they may be insufficient) by surrender at redemption prices of bonds for cancellation.
5.      Germany to have the.right to redeem bonds of the 1st  -series as on any interest date after 30th June 19215 at the prioe shewn in Schedule A.As soon as but not before the 1st serieis of bonds has been redeemed Germany to have the right to redeem bonds of the 2nd series as on any interest date at a discount -of 3/8 per cent for each unexpired half year.Redemption of both series at more favourable rates to be permissible by agreement between Germany and the respective Powers interested subject to the approval of the Reparation Commission. &apos;The bonds to be negotiable as between the Joverhments of the Powers to which they are issued and as between these Governments and the Reparation Commission but not otherwise except with the specific sanction of the Reparation Commission, Redemption to be effected by direct agreement between the German Government and the respective bondholders.    In&apos;default of agreement,  redemption money may be paid to the Reparation Commission who will call up bonds for redemption in Spa Agreement percentages.6.      80% of the bonds of the 1st series to be distributedforthwith to the Powers entitled to reparation in the SpaAgreement percentages.The remaining 20$ to be retained by the ReparationCommission as a Reserve for adjustment of accounts betweenPowers and for the payment of miscellaneous Treaty chargesas provided below.$lie intention is that these bonds should in no case be placed on the mcrket, the &quot;mobilization&quot; of the German debt being effected exclusively by this floatation of German loans to effect tho redemption of the original, bonds.    The exception is introduced to provide for the contingency of the United States Government agreeing to accept the bonds in payment of debts owing to the United States.
7v &apos; &apos; Belgium to discharge her existing debit in respect of her priority adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4 by surrender to the Reparation Commission Reserve of bonds of the 1st series to a face value equal to the amount ofx - - ------ -  &amp;ir*f*--z-the debit plus 25 per cent. ....Belgium to waive her claims to priority of.payment over other Powers in so far ss they have not already boon met. 8.      The United States (subject to the consent of that Power),  Great Britain and Franco to receive out of bonds of the let series retained as a. reserve by the Reparation Commission amounts to a face value equal to their respective credits arising out of the last paragraph of- -article 232 of tho Treaty (Belgian war Debt, )9.     All other outstanding debits and credits as between Powers entitled to reparation and the Reparation Commission to be cleared as on 1 January 1923 by transfer of bonds of the 1st series at redemption price.      Debits to be adjusted by transfer from the debtor Power to the Separation Commission Reserve and credits by transfer from the Reserve to the creditor Power.10.    ae from January 1,  1983 costs of irmiee of Occupation and&apos; Clearing Office and other miscellaneous charges up to such amount per annum as i-ae .^operation Commission may approve except in so far as they can be met from cash accruing to the Reparation Commission reserve in respect the present value of the Bonds on the 5fo tablo being 8C&apos;,&apos;;..- 4 -
of interest on bonds in that reserve to be discharged by transfer of bonds at redemption price from the Reparation Commission reserve to the Powers entitled to the payments,    Any bonds remaining in the reserve when its liabilities hate been liquidated to be distributed to the various Powers entitled to reparation in the Spa Agreement percentages. 11.    Germany to agree,  in the event of any failure to pay the interest due upon the bonds at any due date, forthwith to hand over to the Reparation Commission or to any Allied Power authorised to act on its behalf whatever revenues or assets of the German Empire or German States the Commission or such power may select.-In the event.of. such failure the Bowers represented on the Separation Commission shall be-entitled to adopt whatever measures may in their unanimcras judgment appear.necessary to enforce their rights.    Such measures may include the occupation of German territory outside the treaty. occupation area and the talcing over of German fiscal machinery.1.2.    All loans raised by Germany in the national market of any -Power which is a holder of any of the bonds to be applied to the redemption of bonds held by.that Power unless and except to such extent aa the Government of that Power may otherwise agree. 13.    European Inter--allied Debts,The deposits of gold which are held by Great Britain as security for loans made to Prance and Italy for the purpose of/
carrying on the war, to be applied forthwith towards therepay-riient of these loans.The French share of the German Bonds applicable to the repayment of Belgian&apos; Far Debt to be transferred to Great Britain and accepted by her as satisfaction of sn eqUsl amount of the French debt to Great Britain.1% ifilllards 1st series German bon^s to be transferred by Italy to Great Britain and accepted- by Great Britain ir. discharge of an amount of the Italian Debt to Great Britain equal to the face value of the bonds. -The balance of the French and &quot;Italian &quot;War debt s to-Great Britain to be written, off;   all counter&apos;&quot;claims.by France and Italy at the same time being abandoned.The Italian Debt to France to be written off.Great Britain and France to transfer &quot;-to the Reparation Commission as trustees the net war&quot;debts owing to them by Serbia, Rcuraania, Greece and Portugal to be dealt with as provided below.On the 1st April 1933 the Bends of&quot; the second series tobe distributed as followsGreat Britain ))France 5 The - aggregate Spa Agreement)Italy )percentages of theseAny other Powers       )Powers.which, way accept-arrangement s re ferred) to below. )- Belgium ))Their respective Spa .Japan ))Agreement percentages -Anv other Powers       ) which may not accept? these arrangement .  )The aggregate share assigned to -the first-mentioned group ofPowers to be divided in proportion to the respective payments and obligations of these Powers to the U.S.A. in respect of war adwice-

IT 0 T E    &quot;A&quot;448The governing principles of the plan are(1)    to fix a minimum German liability which is well&apos;within the less sanguine estimates which have been made by financial exports of German capacity and a Supplementary liability which is prima facie not unduly onerous fcojS which can be reduced ordbanoelled by an impartial tribunal if it she Id prove in the event to be excessive. (2)    to substitute for the present fixed obligations of the European Allies to Great Britain arrangements under which all except a small percentage (which would be accepted in the form of a transfer of Ger-man or other inter-ellied obligations) Would be re-mitt ed but under which the contingent Gorman pay-ments in excess of the fixed minimum would be applied to discharging European debts to America generally.(3)    to give very liberal terms to Germany for the earlyredemption of the annual payments by anticipation. The primary obligation of Germany is put into the fore, of 50 milliard g.m. 32 year bonds bearing no interest for 4 years, 4 per cent for the next four and 5 per cent thereafter.    No provision is proposed for a sinking fund but the bonds can be redeemed on terms which, if Gorman credit recovers, will enable the interest and sinking fund on the loans required for redemp-tion to be met out of the resultant saving on the interest on the bonds.Germany is thus given a double inducement to borrow from the public to redeem the original bonds,    sThese are not intended&apos; for is&quot;sue to the public but-merely as &quot;security for the annual payments and as counters for purposes of accounting. ,A(a)
(a) She., frees herself from her direct liability to tho Allied Governments and so has a chance of aecolorat-ing the date of termination of Allied 1 &apos;i lit cry Occupation.(b) She substitutes without additional cost a terminable- for a perpetual liability.The merits claimed for the plan are that its adoption will make the restoration of German credit possible and lead to the recovery of very substantial sums for repara-tion, while persistence in the policy of attempting to enforce impossible claims will end in the destruction of the creance altogether.The present value of the primary obligation under the plan cannot be precisely estimated, owing to the redemption options.If the adoption of the plan led to a rapid revival of German credit and Gerf.tany were able by raising loans to pay off the whole of the fixed annuity in the first few years the present value might not be more and might possibly be even less than 30 milliards.But if this -happened the Allies would have actually &apos;: received this 30 milliards and Germany would undoubtedly be in a position to pay for  the service of the 2nd scries of bonds when they fall to be created 10 years&apos;hence and redeem that series also very rapidly.      In that event this 2nd s cries would be worth at least its present value on the 6 1/4 per cent table - 7.4 milliards,  so that on this supposition the whole indemnity would have been collected in 12 or 15 years (mainly in the first ten) end a present value of over 37 milliards realised.On the worst assumption that no German loans became possible either now or in the future, that the 2nd series of bonds has to be cancelled altogether and Germany merely pays the interest on the 1st series as a perpetual annuity beginning four years hence at 2 milliards and rising four yea/later
A 4 3 &amp; /a 0later at 2-^ milliards, the present value on the 5 percent table is 39-g- milliards.The annual burden on Germany under the plan is  : -For the first four years nil&quot;     &quot;    second   &quot;       w &apos; 2 milliards&quot;      &quot;    next 2 1/4     11 2fc milliardsThereafter 2% to 3 1/3milliards accord-ing to the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal.This burden (which will be reduced if Germany raisesredemption loans on favourable terms) covers all financialliabilities under the Treaty.-12-
n -o t E     B , POSITION    OF    GREAT&apos;   BRITAIN,    PRArCE,  italyamd  g&quot;;r:,.:ary- under  the   plan.ition of Great Britain,,The present value of the 1st series Bonds on the 5/o table is 39-g- milliards.    On the inconceivable &apos; hypothesis that Germany is able to raise loans to redeem the whole of thorn next year, the liability would be extinguishable for 25 milliards.    On any plausible hypothesis as to progress of redemption the present value is somewhere between 30 and 39-g- milliards accord-ing to the dates at which redemption is effect ecliThe present value of the 2nd series on the 5 per cent table is about 10i milliards, assuming that the obligation to issue them is not modified, by the Arbitral Tribunal.   Allowing for the risk of such modification and the privileges of redemption at a discount, the series could not prud.en.tly bo held to be worth mere than 5 or 6 milliards  (present value).If we take tho present value of the 1st scries at 34 milliards and of the second at 6, the British share 22/&apos;. of 80;&apos;l of tho 1st series and (say)  42;.&apos; of the 2nd. would amount to 8^5 milliards.      Adding 1P4 milliards for gold, deposits, and 3.2 milliards for the Belgian Debt (including the portion to bo coded by Prance) and 1 mil-liard for the 1^ milliards  (free value) 1st series bonds to be coded by Italy we reach a total of 14.1 miIlia?ds as against our American debt of 20 milliards./Tho British
Tho British share of the 2nd. series would, however, be materially increased if t e Continental Allies obtained relic in respect of their American debts, so  that the plan may be regarded as giving us a fair chance of covering from 70/1 to 80* of our capital liability to America&apos;,If our American d.debt takes the form of long date bonds at 4 l/4 % interest its value on the 5 ;;&apos;   table night bo reduced by anything up to ,15/5 raising the percentage of cover to 80 or possibly to 90 per centoOn the assumption that there is no cancellation of any of the debts owing to America either British or Continental, the distribution of 2nd. series bonds proposed gives Great Britain only about 1.2 milliards  ( ,60 millions) more than would, bo given by a simple remission of the balance of inter-allied debts not adjusted on the 1st series bonds and tho retention of the British Spa Agreement percentage (22,&apos;) inrespect of 2nd scries bonds,,horr everIt is highly improbable/that within the next ton years America will be able to avoid cither cancelling a large part if not the whole of the Continental indebtedness to her or following the British example and dealing with the bulk of it in terms of 2nd series Gorman Bonds.    In the former event practically the whole of the 2nd. scries bonds would under the plan become assignable to Groat Britain,  in tho latter practically the whole of then would be divided, between Great Britain and America,    In either event the Continental allies would retain a very swall interest &quot;with tho result that reasonable concessions to Germany if such concessions should be necessary would be much easier to  secure.
Position of grance.  jThe position of Prance under the status quo (takingM. - Bokanowski&apos; s estimate of the value on the       table of theSchedule of Payments annuities - -Chambre des Deputes Ko.482bp. 1251 is ^2.% of Schedule of Payments annuities milliards(present value on       table 65 Milliards) 33.8Debts due       Prance in respect cf war advances to Italy,. Serbia, Roumania and Greece (3.89 milliard francs at 3.3 francsto the gold mark) 1*235-oDeduct net debt to Great Britain 10*5Net creance (leaving out of account debt to America) 24*5Hlds.This is upon a valuation of the paper assets at 100% notwithstanding that in fact the arrangements ,of the Schedule of Payments have already hopelessly broken dcwn and the chances of receiving anything appreciable from the,Allied debtors is somewhat remote. S&apos;o allowance is made fcr the cost of &quot;mobilisation&quot; of the German debt which (if such mobilisation became possible at all) would undoubtedly be very considerable.The position cf Prance under the new plan(again, estimating cn the 5% table ) is  : -52% of %Q% of 39*5 milliards (present value of 50 milliards 1st series bonds after allowing fcr intereststispensions) 16*43 milliardsAbout 3C% of 10*5 milliards (present value of 23id series bonds after allowing for deferment of issue) 3*15 milliards19*58 milliards.This valuation makes no allowance for the cost ofthe advantages allowed to Germany on early redemption (com-parablo with the loss on &quot;mobilisation&quot;7&quot; not allowed for in theestimate under status quo) or for the risk of cancellation of the 2nd scries of bonds in whole or in pa^rt by the Arbitral Tribunal.*This&quot;loss would under the existing arrangements materialise in the form of having to issue the % bends to the public at a dis-count or having to allow them to be released to the German Government at a price sufficiently attractive to make it worth the while of that Government to raise loans on its own account to effect the redemption.
The adoption of the plan would thus mean a reduction in the French net paper creance (leaving out of account the French deht.to America) froBO 2/4*5 to 19*58, i.eM hy 4.92 milliards or 20;a.     As against which Prance obtains a reasonably good asset against a bad one ;      complete -.release from her debt to Great Britain and acceptance of the principle which is of great value for purposes of negotiation with America that interallied indebtedness .in so far ae it Is dis-charged at all should be dealt with&apos;In the main hy redistribution-tion. of - the deferred German obligations leaving the bulk of the primary obligations for. reparation.Position of Italy.Under the status quo the whole of the Italian share of the present value of the Schedule of Payment annuities (65 milliards) 6*5 milliards would be insufficient to cover the Italian net debt to Great Britain and Prance 9&quot; 64 milliards..Under the new plan Italy is relieved of the greater part of these debts and receives :-1st.Series Bonds.-10 f* of. 80?&amp; of 50 milliards (face value)      s   4 milliards less . l-y milliards to be ceded to Great Britain.net 2jr milliards of which the ...present value on the 5/* table is . 1*97 milliards.2nd Series- Bonds...About of-10-&apos;.5 milliards.. 1-89&apos;     . &quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;.&apos;&apos; .&apos; 3&apos;:86 milliards. .
Under the status quo the liabilities of germany on the 5% table are  :-Schedule of Payments Annuities (present value    65 milliards Other Peace Treaty charges (say) 5       * .TO milliards.Under the new plan the minimum liability (leaving out of account savings by redemption) is the present value of the 1st Series bonds viz. ,     $fjg- milliards And the maximim liability is ^0   milliards.There is therefore a minimum reduction fcf nearly,; 30 per cent and a maximum reduction (leaving out of account possible savings on redemption) of nearly 44-per cent.The saving is likely in any event to be nearer the maximum than the minimum since either German credit will not be restored, in which case the 2nd series bonds are likely to be cancelled by the Tribunal, or it will be restored with the result that Germany will be able to effeot considerable . savings by redemption on favourable terms,Apart from the actual reduction in the present value cf the obligation,  Germany secures the enormous advantages of (a) a complete relief for 4 years (b) a fixed moderate charge for the next six (c) a definite annual maximum of reasonable amount thereafter (d) freedom from indeterminate charges for Peace Treaty obligations other than reparation and (e) a chance of being able to discharge the whole  lability by raising foreign loans in a comparatively short period and so obtaining the early withdrawal of the armies of occupation.
