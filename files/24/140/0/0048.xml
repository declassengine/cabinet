CONFIDENTIAL.   \\*\   Q^&quot;&apos;* 4&apos;&apos;       M) Section 2.w  -[C 16643/99/18] . No. 1.memorandum on the Reparation Position. I. Introduction.AT the London Conference last August, the French Prime Minister brought forward certain proposals for the settlement of the reparation question which proved inacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government. At the forthcoming meeting on the 9th December, it is to be expected he will renew them, probably in a somewhat modified form, and the question arises what line of action His Majesty&apos;s Government should then adopt.II. General Survey.Treaty Position.2. The Treaty of Versailles provided : (a.) That Germany should undertake to make compensation for all damage done by the aggression of Germany to the civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers, and to their property during the period of belligerency of each as an Allied and Associated Power &quot; as well as for the reimbursement of the Belgian war debt to the Allied and Associated Governments;(&amp;.) That the amount of the damage as above defined should on or before the 1st May, 1921, be assessed by the Reparation Commission;(c.) That the Reparation Commission should &quot; draw up a schedule of payments prescribing the time and manner for securing and discharging the entire obligation of Germany within a period of thirty years- from the 1st May, 1921;&quot; and(d.) That the Reparation Commission should, &quot;after the 1st.May, 1921, from time to time consider the resources and capacity of Germany, and after giving her representatives a just opportunity to be heard, should have discretion to extend the date and to modify the form of the payment, but not to cancel any part except with the specific authority of the several Governments represented on the commission.&quot;Fixation of Reparation Debt.3. Germa,ny&apos;s total debt to the Allies was accordingly fixed at 137-g- thousand million gold marks (6,875,000,000Z. gold). This sum included the Belgian war debt to the Allies (which by inter-Allied agreement has priority over all other reparation payments) and certain minor sums due to small financial adjustments.Schedule of Payments.4. On the 5th May, 1921, the Reparation Commission notified Germany that this debt was to be discharged by annual payments of 2,000 million gold marks (100,000,000?. gold) plus 26 per cent, of the value of Germany&apos;s annual exports, which were estimated at 1,300 million gold marks (65,000,000?. gold).Value of Reparation Payments to Date.5. On the 30th September, 1922 (the latest date for which figures are available), the total payments actually made by Germany amounted to 7,000 million gold marks (350,000,000?. gold); but of this sum 2,500 million gold marks (125,000,000?. gold) had been absorbed by the cost of the armies of occupation, &amp;c, thus leaving only a payment of 4,500 million gold marks (225,000,000Z. gold) to be deducted from the reparation debt. That debt therefore stands to-dav at approximately 133,000 million gold marks (6,650,000,000?. gold).[182 e-2]GERMANY. t [December 5.]
German- A attitude.8. On the.14th December, 1921, the German Government applied for a suspension of certain of the payments due during 1922; and on the 21st March, 1922, the Reparation Commission reduced the payments due during the year by about one-third. On the 14th July the German Government asked for yet a further reduction in the 1922 payments, and also in those due in 1923 and 1924. The request for the 1922 moratorium was met by the reduction of German cash payments in 1922 to delivery of German Treasury bills in lieu of the cash payments which, under inter-Allied arrangements, would otherwise have fallen to the Belgian share. But the question of the 1923 and 1924 payments remained unsolved.7. On the 14th November, 1922, the German Government notified the Reparation Commission of their inability to make any further treaty payments (i.e., for reparation in cash or in kind, for clearing offices, for armies of occupation, &amp;o), pending the stabilisation of the mark.Fall in the Mark.The main stages in the rapid fall of the mark are shown in the followingtableDate. January 1, July 1, September 1, January 1, March 1, June 1, July1, September 1, October 1, November 1, December 1,19211922Marks to the  . 258 280 320 771 1.007 1,188 1,750 5,725 7,125 20,000 34,0009. The causes of this collapse are of the highest importance and the position cannot be understood without considering them. The German view is that collapse has been caused by reparation payments and the reparation menace. This is only partially true.. The essential cause is that reparation payments (both in cash and in kind, the latter mainly coal) have been met not by taxation but by printing notes. Each new demand for reparation has been met by increased use of the printing press. Every fresh demand has been followed by the more rapid deterioration of Germany&apos;s financial and currency position.10. Owing to the collapse of the mark, the possibility of any adequate reparation payment out of German funds had, by May 1922, become so problematical that the Reparation Commission decided to put to an independent committee of foreign bankers the question whether a foreign loan could be floated by Germany to meet her liabilities. On the 10th June this committee reported that such an enquiry was useless so long as the reparation debt remained fixed at the existing figure.11. This opinion has been endorsed by the foreign financial experts whom the German Government, in October 1922, called in to advise on the practicability of the stabilisation of the mark. They reported that the suspension of reparation payments was an essential preliminary to stabilisation and to the renewal of confidence upon which any foreign loan must depend.,French Attitude.12. The attitude of the French Government so far as can be ascertained is not that the grant of all further concessions to Germany must be refused, but that the grant to Germany of any further moratorium must depend upon the giving by Germany of what are called &quot;productive pledges.&quot; These &quot;productive pledges&quot; were, at. the London Conference in August 1922, stated by M. Poincare to comprise Allied control of the whole of the German customs, in addition to the establishment by the Allies of a customs barrier between occupied and unoccupied Germany and around the Ruhr basin; the levy and retention by the Allies of certain taxes in occupied territory and the delivery to the Allies of certain State mines and forests, and of a percentage of the share capital of certain factories. When examined by the Allied experts at the conference, these &quot;pledges,&quot; with the exception of Allied
-control of the customs and of the levy and retention by the Allies of the taxes in occupied territory (which latter suggestion the experts did not examine at all), were judged upon a majority report to be relatively unproductive of financial profit.13. From indications gathered confidentially from Belgian sources, it appears that France still holds to the idea of &quot; productive pledges,&quot; which now threaten to take the form of the occupation of Essen (no doubt with a view to the complete control of the Ruhr); and the &quot; organisation &quot; of the occupied Rhineland (presumably with the ultimate political object of a closer economic union of that region.with France and a correspondingly less close political union with Germany).14. It has never been clear whether, in advocating the taking of these &quot; pledges,&quot; French policy is inspired primarily by a desire to secure the payment of reparation, or by a determination to obtain some more complete safeguard against German aggression. Both these motives, though their concurrent attainment is by all expert authorities held to be impossible, probably actuate the French Government.Belgian Attitude.15. The Belgian position is not an easy one. Reports from His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Brussels indicate that the Belgian Government view with apprehension the possibility of an extension of French influence in the Rhineland, which they fear would greatly increase the dependence of Belgium upon France. There are, however, indications that, opposed as they are to such an extension of French influence, they are not prepared to risk a breach with France to prevent it. They would gladly see others pull the chestnuts out of the fire. They do not intend to risk burning their own fingers. Rather than see France act alone, they would, however unwillingly, join her in an aggressive territorial policy on the Rhine.Italian Attitude.16. The attitude of the Italian Government is, as usual, vague and uncertain. During the London Conference last August Signor Schanzer was inclined to side with the British Government in opposing the French policy on &quot; pledges,&quot; but, as in the case of Belgium, it must always be remembered that Italy is unlikely to risk a definite breach with France. It will&quot; be well not to count upon any Italian support should Great Britain find herself compelled to pursue a line of policy not favoured by France.General Observations.17. If France were to refuse all concessions, and to insist on the execution of the treaty (and all subsequent decisions based thereon) as it stands, and on taking &quot; pledges&apos;&apos; to enforce it, that is a point upon which we should no doubt have definitely to disassociate ourselves from France.18. It is more probable that France will not refuse to make concessions, whether as to a moratorium or as to a loan (from which payments to France and other coun-tries on reparation account could be made); but that in offering such concessions she will insist on &quot; pledges &quot; which will, in her opinion, guarantee Germany&apos;s future payments.19. To such a policy it would perhaps not be equitable that we should raise definite objections. Rather should we concentrate on seeing that any &quot; pledges &quot; so taken are not of a kind to impede, or even render impossible, the very reparation payments from Germany which the &quot; pledges &quot; are meant to secure.Objections to French Proposals.20. Apart from the foregoing observations, the specific objections to the French proposals, if they eventuate on the lines anticipated, are : (a.) The ultimate danger to the peace of Europe inherent in any permanent extension of French influence in territories which are German in language, in sympathy, and by nationality.(&amp;.) The further diminution of Germany&apos;s ability to pay which would probably be entailed by any economic severance from Germany of the occupied Rhineland and of the Ruhr. These regions together account for some one-sixth of the total population of Germany, for some four-fifths of the total German coal production, and for some two-thirds of the total German iron and steel production.
(c.) The increased danger of social disturbances in Germany arising out of any interference with the chief source of the German coal and iron supplies.(d.) The generally disturbing effect on the European trade and industrial situation of any fresh measures of violence directed against Germany, whose foreign trade was, in 1918, the second largest in volume of the countries of the world.(e.) The American Government is sure to view the occupation of the Rhineland. and the Ruhr with grave misgiving.Disadvantages of Opposing French Proposals.21. On the other hand, it is essential to consider carefully the probable results of opposition to the French proposals. In view of the undoubted bad faith of the German Government in the execution of more than one chapter of the treaty, it would be of very doubtful equity categorically to refuse to entertain these proposals. Such a refusal would place an increasing strain upon the Entente with all that this implies, and the danger of the French isolated action against Germany.22. Moreover, unless some effective guarantee of a fair reparation payment is extracted from Germany in the more or less immediate future, there is clearly a danger that by the mere efflux of time it will become more and more difficult to extract such a payment, with the not improbable result that in the end Germany will pay nothing at all. She would then, owing to her inflationist proceedings be the one, great industrial Power in Europe enjoying all the advantages accruing, from the extinction of both foreign and internal debt.IV.- Conclusions.23. The essential features of any satisfactory settlement seem to include :  (a.) Stabilisation of the mark.(b.) A moratorium, of substantial duration for Germany.(c.) Scaling down of reparation payments to an amount generally accepted as being within Germany&apos;s capacity to pay. (d.) Some immediate relief for the French budget which probably can onlybe obtained in an effective degree through a loan. (e.) A settlement of the question of inter-Allied debts, which has now becomeinextricably entangled with that of reparation.24. For the stabilisation of the mark a complete postponement of all reparation payments for a number of years has been declared essential by all the experts. If &quot; productive pledges&quot; are to be taken from Germany they should not be of a kind seriously to hamper Germany&apos;s economic recovery and&apos; so render stabilisation and the resumption of reparation payments more difficult if not impossible.25. Relief for the French budget, so far as that relief is to come from German reparation, can only materialise after the mark has been stabilised and after Germany&apos;s credit has been re-established. Whether or not, in order to secure the consent of France for the respite necessary for stabilisation, and in order to compel Germany to stabilise, the Allied Governments will have to notify Germany that &quot; productive pledges &quot; will be taken either unless stabilisation is achieved! within a definite time limit, or until German reparation payments are actually and in a satisfactory manner resumed, and whether or not Flis Majesty&apos;s Government should make some concession to France and to the other Allies in the matter of inter-Allied debts, are questions which can hardly be determined! before the course which the discussions at the forthcoming meeting between Prime Ministers will take, becomes clear.Foreign Office, December 5, 1922.o
