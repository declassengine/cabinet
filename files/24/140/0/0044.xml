[November 20.]Section 6.Memorandum on the History of the Negotiations with regard to the Payment of Reparation and of the Inter-Allied Debts (excluding the American Debt) since the despatch of the Allied Ultimatum to the German Government of May 5, 1921..*THE Treaty of Versailles provided  -(a.) That Germany should undertake to &quot;make compensation for all damage done by the aggression of Germany to the civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers and to their property during the period of belligerency of each as an Allied and Associated Power,&quot; as well as for the reimbursement of the Belgian war debt to the Allied and Associated Governments ;(6.) That the amount of the damage as above defined should, on or before the 1st May, 1921, be assessed by &quot;an inter-Allied commission, to be called the Reparation Commission &quot; ;(c.) That the Reparation Commission should &quot; draw up a schedule of payments pre-scribing the time and manner for securing and discharging&apos; the entire obligation of Germany within a period of thirty years from the 1st May, 1921 &quot; ; and. (d.) That the Reparation Commission should, &quot; after the 1st May, 1921, from time to time consider the resources and capacity of Germany, and after giving her representatives a just opportunity to be heard, should have discretion to extend the date and to modify the form of the payments, but not to cancel any part except with the specific authority of the several Govern-ments represented on the commission.&quot;2. The amount of the damage caused by the aggression of Germany was duly assessed by the Reparation Commission on the 25th April, 1921, at 132 milliards of gold marks (6,6()0,000,000L gold). On the 5th May, 1921, there was also forwarded to the German Government, under cover of an Allied ultimatum, a schedule of payments prepared by the Reparation Commission and &quot; prescribing the time and manner for securing and discharging&quot; this debt, less certain minor deductions to allow for deliveries already made, and plus the amount of the Belgian war debt to the Allies. This schedule of payments provided that Germany should pay each year a fixed annuity of 2 milliards of gold marks (100,000,OOOL gold) and a variable annuity equivalent to 26 per cent, of the value of her annual exports. (N.B. -It was expected that, in the earlier years, the variable annuity would amount to some l-3 milliards of gold marks (65,000,0001. gold), and it was hoped that it would serve to adjust the annual reparation payments to the standard of prosperity prevailing at any given moment in Germany.) The schedule of payments also contained certain important provisions entrusting to a &quot; special sub-commission of the Reparation Commission, to be called the committee of guarantees &quot; (a.) &quot; The duty of securing the application &quot; of those articles of the treaty by which Germany undertook &quot; to pass, issue and maintain in force any legislation, orders and. decrees that may be necessary to give complete effect&quot; to the reparation provisions, and by which the cost of reparation and all other costs arising under the treaty were made &quot; a first charge upon all the assets and revemies of the German Empire and its constituent States &quot; ; and(6.) The function of &quot;supervising the application&quot; of certain funds (i.e., notably the proceeds of the customs duties) which were to be specially assigned by the German Government as security for the reparation payments. The committee of guarantees was &quot; not authorised to interfere in German administration.&quot;3. The payments due under the May 1921 schedule during the year 1921 were punctually made (i.e., a sum of 1 milliard of gold marks (50,000,0001. gold), was handed over in gold, foreign currencies or foreign bills by the 3lst August, 1921, thus H    covering the only two instalments of the fixed annuity due in the year 1921, and the* This memorandum embodies and supersedes the Foreign Office memoranda of the 15th July, 1922, and 5th October, 1922.[154 u-6] bgermany. -    Jr&apos;\ n r.    ,, . ,,, , V )\confidential: ,, :- &apos;  n   c:[C 16237/99/18] No. 1.
first instalment of the variable annuity, due on the 15th November, 1921, was covered in the main by deliveries in kind).4. Nevertheless, before the end of September 1921, whether with or without the connivance of the German Government and the German industrials, the May 192] schedule of payments was already in process of dissolution. The mark exchange on London, which stood at 240 to the pound at the end of May 1921, had fallen to 300 by the middle of August 1921. It stood at 450 at the end of September 1921, and at the end of October and November 1921, the figure was 700 and 1,150 respectively. The serious situation threatened by this collapse in the mark exchange induced the Committee of Guarantees to visit Berlin in force at the end of September 1921 to review the position. The report addressed by the committee to the Reparation Commission, as the result of this visit, was not encouraging. It pointed out that whilst the extravagant expenditure and feeble fiscal policy of the German Government were in the mam responsible for the difficult situation which had been created, the only chance of the continued operation of the May 1921 schedule of payments was the negotiation by the German Government of a loan, whether by means of credits advanced by German nationals or by means of credits obtained from abroad. After studying this report, the Reparation Commission themselves proceeded to Berlin on the 9th Novem-ber, 1921. They &quot;urged the German Government with energy to devote its attention to the measures which were immediately necessary to assure the payment of the instalments due&quot; under the May 1921 schedule in January and February 1922.5. Dr. Wirth then made a desperate effort to obtain some contribution from the German industrials sufficient to postpone at any rate the danger of an immediate default. This effort failed, and on the 14th December, 1921, the German Government formally warned the Reparation Commission that the amounts necessary to meet the January and February 1922 instalments would not be forthcoming.6. The heads of the British and French Governments met in London on the 22nd December, 1921, and decided to recommend to the Supreme Council, which was to meet at Cannes in January 1922. the grant to Germany of a partial moratorium for the forthcoming year in respect of the payments under the May 1921 schedule. These recommendations were duly considered by the Allied financial experts at Cannes, who agreed to advise that a moratorium should be granted to Germany for the year 1922. This moratorium was to comprise limitation of the cash payments for the year 1922 to 7v&apos;0,000,000 gold marks (36,000,000L gold) of the deliveries in kind to a maximum value of 1,450,000,000 gold marks (72,500,OOOZ. gold) and the setting off of the annual recoverable costs of the armies of occupation (which were to be limited to 220,000,000 of gold marks (11,000,OOOL gold) as from the 1st May, 1922, against the value of the deliveries in kind to be credited to Germany in the reparation account. The Allied experts advised also that, in return for the concession represented by the grant of this moratorium, Germany should be asked to give certain guarantees for the re-establisb-ment of a sound financial system, such presumably as to enable her to resume payment as soon as possible under the May 1921 schedule. These guarantees were to include the fixation of the German customs duties on a gold basis, the abolition of subsidies, the imposition of adequate coal taxes and adequate railway and postal rates, the effective prohibition of the export of capital, the limitation of the note issue, and the grant of autonomy to the Reichsbank. It was also suggested that the German Government should be asked &quot; to recognise the full power of the Committee of Guarantees to supervise the execution of these measures and to assist the committee by all means in its power in the exercise of its functions of supervision.&quot;7. The foregoing proposals were, however, never approved by the Supreme Council^ which broke up in confusion on the 13th January, 1922, as the result of the fall of M. Briand. In these circumstances, and as a temporary measure, the Reparation Commission, on the 13th January, 1922, upon the instructions of the surviving members -of the Supreme Council (a.) Notified the German Government of the postponement of the cash payments due under the May 1921 schedule on the 15th January and the 15th February, 1922 ; and (b.) Demanded, pending a more definite decision, the payment every ten days, beginning from the 18th January, 1922, of instalments of 31,000,000 of gold marks (T55Z. millions gold). &apos; The German Government were also asked to submit to the commission within fifteen days their own programme of budget and currency reform, with appropriate guarantees, in addition to a complete programme of cash payments and deliveries in kind for the year 1922.
8. The German Governments proposals were received on the 28th January, 1922. They included an expose of the efforts which the German Government were making to balance their budget and to create a budget surplus, out of which the reparation payments could be met. But they contained no definite scheme which could be used as a basis for the fixation of the reparation payments for the year 1922. So far as the question of the fixation of these payments was concerned, the German Government contented themselves with drawing attention to the impossibility, so long as they were faced with an annual import surplus oF some two milliards of gold marks (1,000,000/. gold), of paying reparation except by the purchase of foreign exchange. They explained also that the continued purchase of exchange oil the present scale would, only result in a fresh violent fall in the value of the mark, renewed crises, and probably no reparation in 1923. The German Government accordingly asked the -Reparation Commission to fix for the year It&apos;22 lower cash payments than those foreshadowed by the Allied financial experts at Cannes, and to reduce the 1922 deliveries in kind to the lowest possible figure. They hoped that if concessions such as these were granted it might eventually become possible to pay reparation by means mainly of a, foreign loan.9. The German Governments proposals were under consideration by the Reparation Commission during the whole of February 1922 and during the first three weeks of March 1.922. During this period the mark exchange on London, which had recovered from the low point of 1,150 reached at the end of November 1921 to some 800 at the beginning of January 1922, fell again to about 1,000 at the end of February 1922, and to some 1,200 by the middle of March 192;. On the 21st March, 1922, the Reparation Commission announced their decision respecting the 1922 payments, and, despite the recent aggravation in the German financial position consequent upon the renewed fall in the mark, adhered closely to the lines of the settlement recommended by the Cannes financial experts in January 1922. The commission were prepared to grant a moratorium upon the May 1921 schedule for the year 1922 and to limit the payments during the year 1922 to&apos; 720,000,000 of gold marks (36,000:000Z. gold) in cash and to deliveries in kind to the maximum value of 1,450,000,000 &quot;old marks (72,500,0007. gold). This moratorium was not, however, to be finally confirmed until the 31st May, 1922, by which date the German Government must have taken certain legislative and administrative measures designed eventually to re-establish the German, financial position. Included amongst these measures, in addition to those advocated by the Cannes experts, was a demand for an immediate increase in German taxation by a further 60 milliards of paper marks. The German Government were also asked to undertake to allow the Committee of Guarantees to exercise over the German finances a control suffi-ciently thorough to enable the committee at all times to satisfy itself as to the application, of the budgetary legislation, &quot; and more especially as to the work of assessing and collecting the taxes and of detecting any defects therein.&quot; In addition, the German Government were asked to allow the Committee of Guarantees to &quot; check the functioning of the control&quot; to be exercised by the German Government over its expenditure. Finally it was made clear that if on the 3.1st May, 1922, the Reparation Commission found that the measures demanded had not been taken, and that the proposed &quot; control &quot; had not been accepted, the moratorium would be suspended, and the May L921 schedule of payments would re-enter into force. Upon the payments under that schedule not being forthcoming at the prescribed dates, the Reparation Commission would, under paragraph 17 of Annex 2 to Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles, report the German Government for default.10. In the course of April and May 1922 six notes were exchanged between the German Government and the Reparation Commission on various matters arising out of the commission^ note of the 21st March, 1922. Two important points arose in the course of this correspondence. The first concerned the German Governments refusal on the 7th April, 1922, to accept the powers of &quot; control&quot; demanded by the Reparation Commission for the Committee of Guarantees. The Reparation. Commission, however, pointed out on the 13th April, 1922, that they had in reality confined themselves to insistence &quot; on general dispositions by Germany for securing that adequate provision is made for meeting her reparation obligations in priority to avoidable expenditure for domestic purposes and on the German Government providing the commission with the machinery for satisfying itself that these general dispositions are properly and faithfully carried out.&quot; As a result of this explanation, the German Government on the 9th May, 1922, announced their readiness &quot;to afford to the commission all the facilities for investigation asked for.&quot; The second point concerned the announcement made by the German Government on the 7th April, 1922, that &quot; only a foreign loan would make it possible to effect the cash payments for 1922.&quot;    In view of this
announcement the Reparation Commission, in confirming the moratorium on the 81st May,  1922, expressly reserved the right to cancel  the  moratorium, should Germany, &quot; being unable to obtain the desired assistance by way of a foreign Joan,&apos; fail to restrict her note issue in accordance with the undertaking given to the commission on the 28th May, 1922.11. The importance of this reservation was soon to receive practical illustration.. On the 10th June, 1922, the Reparation Commission received the report of the Committee of British, French, Italian, Belgian, German,- American and Dutch Bankers who had been, appointed by the commission on the 4th April, 1922, to report &quot;on the conditions under which the German Government, regard being had to its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles and in particular under the schedule of payments of May 1921, could raise foreign loans to be applied to the redemption in part of the capital of the reparation debt.&quot; The report of this committee made it clear that the raising of a foreign loan was impossible owing to the French opposition to the majority decision taken by the Reparation Commission on the 7th June, 1922, empowering the committee to consider the conditions of the issue of a loan, even though modifications of the treaty and of the schedule of payments might be thereby necessitated. In order that a foreign loan might be raised by Germany, it was essential that the French Government, who after all were Germany&apos;s chief creditors, should &quot; desire an enquiry into the more general conditions necessary for the re-establishment of Germany&apos;s-external credits.&quot; &quot;If at any time the Reparation Commission were able to repeat by unanimous decision the invitation which has now been extended by a majority (i.e., to consider the conditions of a loan even though modifications of the May 1921 schedule might be involved), the Bankers&apos; Committee would be glad to meet again and. resume the enquiry which has now been interrupted.&quot;12. The bankers&apos; report was received throughout Europe with the utmost gloom. The mark, which had stood at some 1,200 to the pound at the beginning of June 1922, had fallen to 1,600 to the pound by the end of the month, and to 2,400 to the pound at the end of the first week in July 1922. In accordance, however, with the procedure accepted by the German Government on the 28th May, 1922, in return for the grant of the moratorium,, the Committee of Guarantees proceeded to Berlin during June 1922 to discuss with the German Government the questions of the supervision of German Government receipts and expenditure, the prevention of the export of capital, and the publication of pre-war statistics. But as Lord D&apos;Abernon telegraphed on the 7th July, 1922, the negotiations conducted by the Committee of Guarantees were in the main &quot; concerned with details which have no vital or urgent importance and no bearing on the emergency measures necessary to save a catastrophe.&quot;13. By the end of June 1922 it was clear, especially from informal interviews between Sir Basil Blackett and Dr. von Simson, that the German Governments request for a further extension of the moratorium could not be long delayed. On tho 12th and 14th July, 1922, formal requests to this end were made by the German Government to the Reparation Commission and to the Allied Governments themselves. The two notes, containing these requests, may be summarised as follows : The German Government requested the Reparation Commission, &quot; with reference to article 234 of the Treaty of Versailles, to grant them a respite for the 1922 cash pajunents falling clue&quot; under . the March 1922 moratorium. They &quot; recommended &quot; in particular the postponement in the interests of a speedier stabilisation of the exchange  of the cash payment due under the March 1922 moratorium on the 15th July, 1922. (N.B. This recommendation was refused by the Reparation Commission on the 13th July, 1922.) The Reparation Commission were also told- that the -German Government &quot; considered it indispensable that Germany should be freed during 1923 and 1924 from payments in cash resulting from the May 1921 schedule of payments &quot; In addition to the requests made to the Reparation Commission, the German Government asked the Allied Governments to consent to the reduction to 500,000L a month of the monthly payments of 2,000,OOOZ , which had to be made under an agreement of the 10th June, 1921, to the Allied clearing offices to cover the German obligations arising out of the clearing office proceedings. Beyond these monthly payments, all cash payments were to be suspended, other apparently than those still due during the remainder of the year 1922 under the March 1922 moratorium and amounting to some 300,000,000 to 320,000,000 gold marks (15,000,000L to 16,000,0001 gold). (N.B.- No mention was made, either in the note of the 12th July, 1922, or in the note of the .14th July, 1922, of the future of the deliveries in kind or of the-
[154 u- 6&apos;!cmeasures of financial stabilisation to be adopted by the German Government during the period of the extending moratorium. It is understood that the omission to mention either of these matters was due to internal political reasons.)14. Before the German Governments notes of the 12th or 14th July, 1922, were considered either by the Reparation Commission or by the Allied Governments, a new factor, which, so far as reparation was concerned, had hitherto loomed but vaguely in the background, was introduced into the forefront of the reparation question by the despatch of the Balfour note on the 1st August, 1922. This note asked the French and Italian, with the Serb-Croat-Slovene, Roumanian, Portuguese and Greek Governments, &quot; to make arrangements for dealing to the best of their ability with loans advanced to them by His Majesty&apos;s Government,&quot; and explained that the &quot;amount of interest and repayment for which His Majesty&apos;s Government ask depends not so much on what the Allies owe to Great Britain as on what Great Britain owes America.&quot; Whilst the note continued that His Majesty&apos;s Government, so far as they were concerned, were &quot; prepared, if such a policy formed part of a satisfactory international settlement, to remit all debts due to Great Britain by her Allies in respect of loans or by Germany in respect of reparations,&quot; the note was ostensibly at any rate taken to imply that the cardinal factor in the matter of the collection of Allied debts to Great Britain was now the attitude of the United States Government. From henceforth, therefore, it became evident that the French Government would not be disposed to agree to any solution on the lines proposed from the British side without some prior assurance as to the remission or reduction of the French debt to Great Britain.15. The German Governments request of the 12th July, 1922, for a further modification of the March 1922 moratorium was considered by the Reparation Commis-sion on the 2nd and 3rd August, 1922. A resolution was then introduced in the commission by Sir John Bradbury, proposing the suspension of all further cash payments by Germany during the year 1922 with the exception of the Clearing Office payments of 500,000Z. per month which the German Government had offered to the Allied Governments in their note of the 14th July, 1922. No formal vote was taken by the commission on this resolution and the discussion of the whole question was adjourned pending the meeting of the Heads of the Allied Governments wdiich was due to take place in London on the 7th August, 1922.16. At this meeting M. Poincare defined the position of the French Government. That Government, apparently in view of the British Governments inability, as explained in the Balfour note, to give any undertaking, independently of the American attitude, not to collect the Allied debts, were not prepared to grant any extension of the March 1922 moratorium except upon the surrender by the German Government of certain &quot; productive pledges.&quot;   These pledges were six in number : (a.) Continuance of Allied control of the German import and export licensing-system in the occupied territories (viz., the Ems organisation).(b.) Re-establishment of the customs barrier on the Rhine, and establishment of a customs barrier around the Ruhr Valley.(c.) Delivery to the Allies of certain State mines and forests.(d.) Delivery to the Allies of a percentage of the share capital of certain chemicaland dye factories in the occupied territories, (e.) Levy and retention by the Allies of certain taxes in the occupied territory. (/.) Effective Allied control of the whole of the German customs.17. The question of the expediency of M. Poincare&apos;s proposed pledges was duly referred to the Allied experts who were instructed &quot; to study and report on the sums which would be made available for reparations if the measures proposed by M. Poincare were adopted by the Allied Governments, and upon the question whether these measures were preferable, to those which had already been adopted in order to obtain reparation from Germany.&quot; The experts&apos; report, which was received on the 9th August, 1922, was not favourable to the French proposals.18. On the 11th August, 1922, certain British counter-proposals were laid before the conference. These counter-proposals, which were during the course of the discussions somewhat modified, eventually comprised : (a.) The continued prosecution by the German Government of the measures of financial and budgetary reform, the commencement of which the Reparation Commission had insisted upon in return for the grant of the March 1922 moratorium.
(b.) The delegation to the Reparation Commission of the decision with regard to an extension of the March 1922 moratorium in so far as the year 1922 was concerned, an extension which was to be conditional upon the satisfactory prosecution of the measures of reform enumerated in 4 (a) above.(c.) The adjournment of the general question of reparation payments in future years and of inter-Allied debts to an international conference to be convened before the end of the year, and on the return of the Allied Financial Missions from America.(d.) The establishment by the Reparation Commission in the event of a German failure to execute the timber and coal deliveries of &quot; a supervision over the State forests and mines in the Ruhr so as to ensure the full execution of these deliveries.&quot;19. This last point, that of the degree of Allied control to be exercised over the &apos;State forests and mines, proved to be the rock upon which the conference broke up. M. Poincare insisted that the grant of any further moratorium to Germany must be conditional upon the bestowal upon the Reparation Commission of a productive pledge of the right to &quot; exercise control over the State mines in the Ruhr and the public forests.&quot; Such control would serve also as a guarantee of the coal and timber deliveries. In the event of a default in these deliveries the Reparation Commission must be allowed to &quot;apply the first charge which article 248 gives to the Allied creditors on the State mines in the Ruhr, &amp;c, by effecting a transfer of the property to the Reparation Commission.&quot;20. As no agreement was possible on this point, the conference broke up on the 14th August, 1922, leaving behind it only one solid achievement, the decision respecting the Clearing Office payments. Under this decision Germany was to pay the 2,000,O00Z. due on the 15th August, 1922, within four weeks of that date, whilst from that date the Allied Governments announced their intention of denouncing the June 1921 Clearing Office Agreement and of negotiating, subject to the approval of the Reparation Commission, separate arrangements with the German Government for the Clearing Office, &amp;c, payments. On the same date (the 14th August, 1922), the Reparation Commission informed the German Government that they had so far been unable to take a decision on the German, request for an extension of the moratorium and that pending this decision the reparation payment of 50,000,000 gold marks (2,500,0001. gold) due on the 15th August, 1922, was temporarily suspended.21. Between the 18th August. 1922, and the 25th August, 1922, a small delega-tion of the Reparation Commission, headed by Sir John Bradbury, visited Berlin in order to study conditions on the spot and in order to explore the possibility of finding some means of meeting the point of view of the French Government as outlined in London. The proposals, put before this delegation by the German Government, included suggestions to guarantee the coal and timber deliveries by means of the formation of a special deposit of 50,000,000 gold marks (2,500,000/. gold) or by means of commercial contracts, entered into by the German Government with the owners of the mines and forests, and providing for very heavy penalties in the case of a default.   Neither of these suggestions was, however, considered satisfactory.22. On the 31st August, 1922, Sir John Bradbury formally moved in the Reparation Commission his resolution (the discussion upon which had been adjourned at the beginning of the month, see paragraph 1 above) advocating the suspension of all cash payments for the remainder of the year and the postponement of the consideration of the question of guarantees until a decision could be taken on the 1923 and 1924 payments. Sir John Bradbury was in a minority of one on this resolution. The Belgian delegate then announced the readiness of the Belgian Government to accept, in lieu of the remaining 1922 cash payments (all of which fell to the Belgian share) German Government six-month Treasury bills &quot; payable in gold and guaranteed in such manner as may be agreed between the German Government and the Government of Belgium (to which Power the future payments have been assigned) or, in default of such agreement, by the deposit of gold in a foreign bank approved by Belgium.&quot; This proposal was accepted by the commission and formally notified to the German Government on the same day (viz., the 31st August, 1922).23. Under the influence of this decision the mark exchange on London, which had stood at some 2,000 to the   on the 12th July, 1922 (the date of the German application for an extension of the March 1922 moratorium) and which had fallen to some 7,000 to 11,000 by the 25th August, 1922, recovered on the 1st September, 1922, to 5,200 to 6,200 to the  .
24. Iij order finally to dispose of the question of the 1922 cash payments, it them, only remained for a Belgian delegation to proceed to Berlin on the 6th September, 1922, to negotiate the method of guaranteeing the German Treasury bills which the Belgian Government had undertaken to accept. These negotiations temporarily broke down on the 11th September, 1922, owing to the insistence of the German Government on the postponement of the date on which these bills would fall due ; but on the 15th September, 1922, a German financial mission visited London in order to discuss the situation in the City, and, as a result of these discussions, the German Government on the 19th September, 1922, formally waived their claim to the prolongation of the bills.25. Even before the German-Belgian negotiations were complete, M. Poincare, in a reply, dated the 2nd September, 1922, to the Balfour note, had further emphasised the views of the French Government on the relation between reparation and inter-Allied debts. In this note M. Poincare announced his conviction that &quot; the reparations problem can only be finally solved if it is united in some way or other to the problem of inter-Allied debts &quot; ; it seemed to him &quot; necessary that this question be examined before long under all its forms at a conference to which all the interested States would be summoned.&quot; France could not consider &quot;any settlement whatever of the debts contracted during the war so long as the expenses which she has borne and which she will have to bear for the reconstruction of the devastated regions have not been met directly by Germanj^, or by means of a combination such as to enable her to mobilise at the earliest possible moment an adequate part of her debt. Once Germany had discharged this obligation, which must take precedence over all others, the French Government would not oppose a proposal for a general settlement of international debts.&quot;26. On the 13th September, 1922, the Belgian Government, at the instigation of the French Government, formally proposed the summoning in the autumn of a conference to deal simultaneously with reparations and inter-Allied debts. His Majesty&apos;s Government on the 9th October, 1922, expressed their readiness to examine the proposal in the most sympathetic spirit, though they considered it premature to define the conditions under which such a conference should take place, or to prepare the agenda, until the result was known of the negotiations of the various Allied missions which were about to proceed to the United States to discuss the funding of the various-Allied debts to the United States. Meanwhile the mark fell from 5,200-6,200 to the   on the 1st September, 1922, to 9,400-9,850 on the 6th October, 1922, and by the end of October ]922, despite the face that no cash reparation payments were being made,, was in the neighbourhood of 20,000 to the  .27. Apart from the dangers presented by the falling mark, it was evident that the discussion of the general question of the 1923 and 1924 payments (which, in default of a new settlement, would be regulated by the schedule of payments of May 1921) could not be long delayed, and on the 4th October. 1922, Sir John Bradbury submitted his proposals on this question to the Reparation Commission. These proposals comprised : (a.) The imposition upon the Reichsbauk by the German Government of the legal obligation to sell gold at a fixed mark price, thereby (l) compelling the Reichsbank, unless it wished to lose its gold reserve, to put a stop to unlimited issues of ,paper and (2) maintaining the stability of the mark.(b.) The substitution for all cash payments (including those in respect of armies of occupation, clearing offices, &amp;c.) during 1923 and 1924 and, in certain eventualities, during 1925 and 1926, of German Treasury five-year bonds, which would, it is hoped, with the stabilisation of the mark, become saleable securities, thei&apos;eby removing their otherwise obvious unpalatability to the creditor Governments.(c.) The continuance of deliveries in kind ; but, in order to prevent their value becoming an immediate charge on the German budget, the German Govern-ment to be paid for them in five-year Treasury bonds reinforced by the guarantee of the Government taking delivery.(d.) The reconsideration by the Allied Governments of existing inter-Allied financial arrangements with a view especially to &quot; grant of indulgence in respect of inter-Allied war indebtedness pending the maturity of the German five-year bonds and the meeting of a general conference in July 1926 to consider the whole reparation and inter-Allied debt position.&quot;[154 u 6] D &quot;

It will be noted that Sir John Bradbury&apos;s proposals of the 4th October, 1922, advocated the grant of a virtual four-year moratorium to Germany as the necessary condition of the stabilisation of the mark, the question of inter-Allied debts to; be then taken up by the Allied Governments. These proposals were, therefore, to a very considerable extent, in clear conflict with those put forward by the French Government at the London Conference of August 1922 and again on the 2nd September, 1922 (see paragraphs 16 and 25 above). It was accordingly to be expected that the proposals put forward by M. Barthou, the French member of the Preparation Commission, would be of a very different character.29. M. Barthou&apos;s proposals, which were submitted to the Reparation Commission on the 22nd October, 1922, were as follows : (a.) The imposition upon the German Government by the Reparation Commission of much stricter measures of financial control, the Committee of Guarantees of the Reparation Commission being empowered to compel the German Government to impose or increase any particular tax and to diminish or put an end to any particular item of expenditure.(b.) The balancing of the German budget and therefore the stabilisation of the mark being rendered possible by these measures, early consideration by the Allied Governments of the questions of German currency reform and of the floating by the German Government of loans destined to facilitate the resumption of the reparation payments.(N.B. It is to be supposed that these latter questions would be considered by the Allied Governments at the general meeting to consider reparations and inter-Allied debts advocated in M. Poincare&apos;s note to the British Govern-merit of the 2nd September, 1922 (see paragraph 25 aboveb)30. With the proposals of Sir John Bradbury and of M. Barthou before them the Reparation Commission left Paris for Berlin on the 29th October, 1922, &apos;; to discuss with the German Government the steps which the commission may judge necessary to secure the balancing of the budget and the stabilisation of the mark.&quot;31. On the 1st November, 1922, the Belgian Government repeated their proposal (see paragraph 26 above) for the meeting in the autumn of a general conference to consider the joint questions of reparations and inter-Allied debts. The beginning of December 1922 was suggested as a suitable date, and His Majesty&apos;s Government were warned that, in the event of their acceptance being long delayed, the French Government intended to summon the conference themselves in Paris. It was not possible to return any answer to this communication beyond a notification despatched on the 14th November, 1922, that the Belgian proposal would be considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government immediately after the general elections.32. The visit of the Reparation Commission to Berlin continued until the 10th November, 1922, and the chief events of that visit are summarised in the following paragraphs.33. Immediately upon their arrival in Berlin the Reparation Commission, on the 31st October, 1922, made it clear that the object of their visit was &quot;to obtain information which would assist them in arriving at the decisions which they might be called upon to take or the advice which they might be called upon to tender upon their return to Paris.&quot; The purpose of the visit was (see paragraph 30 above) to collect information respecting the possibility of stabilising the mark, of balancing the budget and of preventing further increases in the floating debt. On the 4th November, 1922, the German Government, in communicating to the commission memoranda on these subjects, declared that even though, in the absence of a final reparation settlement, the permanent stabilisation of the mark could not at once be attained, yet the immediate introduction of seme degree of stability was essential if the German currency situation was not to be ruined beyond all hope of repair. Currency stabilisation was a prior condition of budget balancing, of the increase of production with a view to an improvement in the balance of trade, of the limitation of the floating debt and of the issue of internal loans. The German Government therefore invited the Reparation Commission &quot; to convoke an assembly of international financiers to examine whether, and under what conditions, the granting of an international bank credit of at least 500,000,000 gold marks, for the purpose of fixing the rate of the mark, might be possible.&quot; On the 6th November, 1922, the Reparation Commission replied that, whilst they would not refuse to examine such a plan for the stabilisation of the -currency, it was for the German Government to submit it in detail in the first instance.
34. On the 7th and 9th November, 1922, the bases of a, plan for the stabilisation of the currency were forthcoming from two different sources the majority and minority reports of the foreign financial experts whose advice had been requested by the German Government (independently altogether of the visit to Berlin of the Preparation Commission) on three questions. These questions and the manner in which thev were answered in the majority report (signed by Messrs. Keynes, Cassel, Jenks and Brand) and in the minority report (signed by Messrs. Dubois, Vissering and Kamanka) are set out in the three succeeding paragraphs.35. Question I. Is it possible to stabilise the mark now ?Majority Report. Not in present conditions owing to (a.) German war and post-war financial policy.(b.) Versailles Treaty burdens.Minority Report.Not in present conditions owing to  (a.) Inflation, which is main cause of inability to balance budget.(6.) Unfavourable trade balance, due to excess of imports, flight of capital, Versailles Treaty burdens.36. Question II. possible ?-If not,  what presuppositions must be realised to render itMajority Report.Whilst permanent stabilisation can only be realised after a final reparation settle-ment is reached, provisional stabilisation, in view of fact that actual debit of trade balance is probably not large, could almost immediately be reached, provided that (a.) Germany was excused all reparation payments for two years ; and(b.) German Governments financial policy was sufficiently energetic to produce and to maintain budgetary equilibrium.Minority Report.(a.) Causes of inflation i.e., failure to balance budget must disappear.(6.) Trade balance debit must be extin-distinguished by (i.) Inci-ease of exports through increase of internal productive activity and decrease of external obstacles to German trade (i.e., foreign anti-dumping legislation.) Decrease in imports, late abnormal increase of which is largely due to disinclination of German nationals to hold marks. Cessation of flight of capital, due to German disinclination to hold marks.(iv.) Cessation of reparation deliveries.37. Question III. If the presuppositions be granted, what measures should be adopted to stabilise the mark ?(ii.)vm.,Majority Report.Foreign exchange to be bought and sold against paper marks at a fixed rate (say, 3,000 to 3,500 to the dollar, 12,000 to 14,000 to the pound) by an &quot;independent board of exchange control, constituted within the organisation of the Reichs-bank,&quot; and with adequate gold from the Reichsbank at its disposal, in addition to any credits German Government may be able to negotiate with an international financial consortium, whose support should be invited.Minority Report.A new gold mark, being a precise frac-tion (say, one-fortieth of the pound), to be instituted as the standard of value, and the value of paper marks in relation to the new mark to be raised by the purchase (and later to be maintained by the purchase and sale) of paper marks by an independent joint stock company or &quot;money bank&quot; specially constituted for this purpose with an original capital of 100,000,000 gold marks, paid in gold by the Reichsbank against shares in the new bank and supported by a credit of 500,000,000 gold marks (present currency) to be obtained from abroad.
38. On the 8th November, 1922, the. German Government communicated to the Reparation Commission details of the plan for the stabilisation of the mark with the aid of an international credit, which they proposed should be examined by an assembly of international bankers &quot; under the auspices&quot; of the commission (see paragraph 33 above). This plan was not based either on the majority or minority reports of the foreign experts, but on an independent report signed by Messrs. Vissering, Dubois and Brand and communicated with the German note.   Under the proposed plan (a.) The international bankers were to investigate the question of establishing an international syndicate, the task of which would be, together with the German Government and the Reichsbank, to work out ways and means for a stabilisation of the mark.(6.) The syndicate was, for this purpose, to have a capital of 500,000,000 gold marks raised in the form of bills maturing in two years, guaranteed on proceeds of the German import tax, and supplemented by a credit of 500,000,000 gold marks advanced by the Reichsbank on the security of its gold reserve.(c.) During the period of the operations of the syndicate, Germany to be relieved of all reparation payments other than deliveries in kind for the reconstruction of the devastated areas, so far as such deliveries might be possible without an increase in the floating debt.39. The Reparation Commission acknowledged receipt of these proposals on the 10th November, 1922, and returned to Paris on the same day.40. There were indications, even before the commission left Berlin, that a more far-reaching proposal than that put forward by the German Government on the 8th November, 1922 (see paragraph 38 above) would soon be forthcoming, and on the 14th November, 1922, a new German note was received by the commission. In this note the German Government stated that they adopted the majority and minority reports of the foreign experts in principle. They also supplemented and further explained the proposals put forward in their note of the 8th November, 1.922. The note of the 14th November, 1922, may be summarised as follows : (a.) Germany to be relieved of all Versailles Treaty payments for a period of three to four years, other than deliveries in kind for the reconstruction of the devastated areas, to such an extent as will not imply an increase in the floating debt.(b.) A conference of international financiers to be convened immediately by the Reparation Commission or the German Government to discuss the question of granting Germany a credit of 500,000,000 gold marks guaranteed by the German Government with the consent of the Reparation Commission and supplemented by a sum of 500,000,000 gold marks set aside in gold or bills by the Reichsbank(c.) The foregoing sum of 1,000,000,000 gold marks to be administered by an independent institution comprising representatives of the foreign lending groups, the Reichsbank and the German Ministry of Finance, and to be used for improving and stabilising the mark exchange, when the German Government will at the earliest possible moment raise an internal loan and endeavour to float foreign loans, one half of the former and the whole of. the latter being devoted to the payment of reparation.Central Department, Foreign Offide, November 20, 11)22.
