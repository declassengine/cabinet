gcument is the Property of His Britannic Ma:1esty*3 Government).secret El. Copy No. JCABINET. C.I-,4360.KEJiOPUNDUid BY ThE QhiifrCELLOft OF ThE EXCHEQUER.1. I have already drawn the attention of my colleagues to the financial position in connection with the Budget for 1923/24.      I aw in communication with the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for ?3ar on the subject of the Navy and Army Estimates for that year.     The Estimates for the Civil Departments.must also be dealt with. 8. As a first step I propose that the Government should adopt the outstanding recommendations in the report of the Home Committee.   In view of the gravity of the financial position, it will be necessary certainly to consider whether further economies cannot be effected but in the meantime it would be of great advantage if the report in question were adopted as fixing the maximum expenditure to be incurred by Departments.I. In three cases &quot;only have representations been made against the adoption of the report, viz: -By the Board of Agriculture        CP.4289 and 4317 By the Ministry of Fensions        CP.4271. By the Ministry of Labour CP.4288.The first of these matters has been disposed of by decisions subsequently announced.As regards the second, the Government have already decided to make no reduction in the flat rate pensions for another three years, but the question of alternative pensions,treatment
treatment arid training allowances was reserved and is now under discussion between the Treasury and the Ministry of Pensions.I attach a note on the question raised by the ifinisterof Labour.(Initialled) S.B.TREASURY, S.,t.13th December, 1922.
COMMITTEE ON EXPENDITURE (CIVIL DEkflftTKBNTS) &apos; Ministry of Labour. Industrial Training 1923/24.The proposal of the late Minister of Labour to maintain the provision for industrial Training in 1923/24 at the fIgure( 4,691*500) for the current year is not based upon a careful estimate of the expenditure likely to be Incurred but mainly upon political considerations.     There is a substantial measure of agreement between the Ministry and the Treasury that the existing schemes of training are not likely to invdlve more than  3,000,000 in 1923/24 (apart from any adjustment due to a revision of allowances on account of the fall in wages and the cost of living).     Even if trade revives it will not have a great effect on the coat of training in 1923/24 as such a revival ban hardly be in full force before ^fay or June next while the period of training averages about 18 months.   The Estimate of  3,000,000 assumes a continuance of the gradual revival that has taken place this year.   If any check la experienced this figure will not be reached.Aa regards any developments of the existing schemes of training, the Treasury will be ready to consider any proposals of the Ministry on their merits, but It is a recognised principle that until new proposals have received some measure of approval from the Government they cannot properly be made the basis of Estimates.      As Dr. dacnamara&apos;s memorandum   &apos; definitely refers to the difficulty of having a large number of men on the     books who have passed their Institutional training and are awaiting improverships, it may be mentioned that
that the Treasury has recently agreed to a scheme for giving &quot;refresher&quot; courses of one month&apos;s training to men who have been out of training for 6 months or more, wherever there is a reasonable prospect of placing the man in an improvership In the near future.The political aspects of the matter turn upon the fear that the Government should be thought to be economising at the expense of the ex-Service men.     Large savings have been made on the Estimates of training expenditure in recent years simply because each excessive Estimate has been based upon liberal assumptions of a revival in trade which have not been realised.   Even if the anticipated revivals had occurred the Estimates would probably still have been on the high side To provide in the Estimates for yet another year much more than is likely to be required will simply intensify the criticism arising from these savings in past years.The contention that the Estimate for 1923/24 must not be less than that for 1922/23, irrespective of the merits of the case, could only be supported, even on political grounds, if the scheme were to continue indefinitely.   But it is not  the waiting list of applicants for training is practically closed an&apos;d the scheme must come to an end in the next 2 or 3 years so that any odium attaching to declining Estimates has to be faced very soon.
