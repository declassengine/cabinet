9 O *)B1* S ^DCCTIMENT ISV THE PPOPSFTY QE EI8 BEITkStlQ. MA JESTY&apos; S GO7T?*TM&quot;FTj,C A B I E E T.; ACTION Jff TURKEY Memorandum by the Lord. President of the Council.The suggestion in the Cabinet that Lord Ourzon should be. asked to ascertain precisely from the French and Italians whether their troops in Constantinople will make common cause with ours in the event of a Turkish attack - upon the breakdown of the Lausanne Conference or otherwise - is sound enough, as far as it goes.     But I should be surprised, if we were to feel re-assured by their reply.     It seems that the combined Allied forces - in the absence of reinforcements whis h we knew-are not to be forthcoming - are not nearly strong enough to resist the Turks effectually.      If fighting once be gain and the Allies were at a disadvantage it is possible that the British might escape, but it is certain the French, and Italians have made no arrangements to get away.      No doubt, therefore, they contemplate no resistance to a Turkish advance and no retirement, but on the contrary intend, if needs be to remain on as spectators without authority at the good pleasure of Mustapha Kemal.      It is probable that the latter is well aware of the above facts and will not believe in any French or Italian threats even if they are uttered.      Unless then, we are prepared to adopt the same course as I suggest our Allies will take, our position in Constantinople is becoming increasingly serious.      I do not feel sure that the Gabpet is prepared to go to that length of conciliation.     Moreover it is not certain that even as spectators we should receive
the same benevolent treatment at the hands of! the Turks as the French and Italians may reasonably&quot; expect,It then we do not intend : to become mere spectators without authority) the sooner we can get our troops put the better - unless,  of course, there Is a probability of a successful issue to the Lausanne Conference.      It would, I submit,... be a,great misfortune - to put off our retirement until   xhe Turks- apply force.&apos;     We may in that ease perhaps still got - away our troops  and part of our stores, but as a sequel.tp our ejection by force,&apos; a massacre of the Christian inhabitants that remain behind is not unlikely,   . .The foregoing considerations lead me to the conclusion that unless Lord Curzon assures us that he has good hopes of the successful issue&apos; of the conference, we should suggest to him to take the earliest opportunity in concert with cur Alliesj  as a friendly action towards the Turks and in order to remove a cause of friction with them,  to wfth-draw the Allied garrison to Gallipoli. .,.:  (Intd)      8, .&quot;ivy Council Office,December 8 oh, 1982. &apos;
