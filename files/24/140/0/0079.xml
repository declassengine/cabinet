SECRET.CP. 4379.CABINET.THE SITUATION IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I circulate an interesting despatch on the present condition of Palestine which I have received from the High Commissioner.DEVONSHIRE.Colonial Office, December 30, 1922.His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, K.G., &amp;c,His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, Whitehall, London, S.W. 1.My Lord Duke, December 8, 1922^ I beg to submit, for your Grace&apos;s consideration, a survey of the present political and economic condition of Palestine.Public Order.There has been observable, particularly during the last twelve months, a decrease in the tension that previously prevailed. The electricity in the atmosphere, the constant fear of serious disturbance, the nervousness of the town populations, which were noticeable during the military administration and during the first year of the civil administration, have markedly diminished. It cannot be said that tranquillity is by any means secure. At any time smouldering embers can be fanned into flame. But the improvement is so far satisfactory. There was one small riot in Jerusalem on the 2nd November of last year, which lasted a short time, resulted in a few casualties, was suppressed without the use of fire-arms, and did not spread elsewhere. With that exception the country has now been free from disturbances for a year and a half.This situation has enabled the garrison to be steadily reduced. Unit after unit has been withdrawn. The present establishment consists of two Indian infantry battalions, one Indian cavalry regiment, one Indian pack battery, the British Palestine gendarmerie of about 700 men, two companies of armoured cars and one squadron of aeroplanes. Steps would have been taken to reduce this establishment further, with the full consent, and indeed at the suggestion of the Palestine Administration, if the arrangements between the Imperial and the Indian Governments had not impeded the more rapid withdrawal of Indian troops. Readjustments have, however, been made or are contemplated, which will have the effect of reducing the cost of the garrison to the British tax-payer from 4 millions, in round figures, in 1921-22, to 2 millions in the present year,&quot; to 1$ millions next year, and to 1 million in 1924-25. How far the cost can be further reduced subsequently must depend, partly upon the degree of tranquillity that is maintained in the country, and partly upon the extent to which the burden of its defence can be transferred to its own revenues. A beginning has been made in this direction by the creation of a Palestinian gendarmerie, drawn from all elements of the population, serving under British officers and paid for by local funds. This force at present numbers 500 men; it is well disciplined and is believed to be reliable. It is intended to increase its numbers as speedily as the local financial situation allows, probably by an additional 500 men next year. In [9284] B    .Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1923.
proportion as this local force is increased, the Imperial forces can be reduced. I anticipate that, if no untoward developments take place, and especially if order is preserved in Trans-Jordania, within two years from now the only units to be maintained here at the cost of the Imperial Government will be the British Palestine gendarmerie, somewhat increased in numbers, the two armoured-car companies and one and one-third squadrons of aeroplanes/with small ancillary establishments,As your Grace is aware, the cost of the Palestine civil administration is defrayed entirely from the local revenues, and has been so defrayed from the beginning.Work of the Administration.At the chai*ge of those revenues, many of the improvements in administration, which are to be expected when a British Government is established in an eastern country, have been effected. A full report of the work which has been done, up to the end of 1921, is about to be published as a White Paper. I would only mention here, summarily, that a very efficient public health service has been established; that primary education has been rapidly extended, 180 new village schools have been opened (the localities providing the buildings and the Govern-ment the teachers); that great progress has been made in the efficiency of the police force, which, although capable of much greater improvement still, is now able to maintain public security at a far higher standard than in the Turkish days; and that an Agricultural Department and a Commerce and Industry Department have been established, and render very useful service in their respective spheres, within the limits of the small financial resources placed at their disposal. In addition, considerable works of development have been carried out, defrayed, partly, from certain revenues of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration, accumulated during the occupation, which accrued to the Palestine Administration; and partly by temporary borrowings from the Crown Agents, to be recouped from the proceeds of the Palestine Government loan, which it is intended to issue at the first opportunity. These works consist of an excellent system of roads, now serving all the more important centres; the equipment and improvement of the railways; the establishment of a telephone service; the beginnings of the drainage of swamps, and of the development of forests, on Government lands; together with a number of minor improvements. Further, a sum of approximately . 400,000 has been borrowed by the Administra-tion from the Anglo-Egyptian Bank and lent to cultivators in small amounts, assistance which has largely contributed to the restoration of the agricultural industry, seriously crippled by the war.I mention the work that has been done in these directions because it has an important bearing both upon the economic and upon the political situation. It is, of course, no more than a small beginning. Two or three years are not enough to enable much headway to be made in the redemption of a derelict land such as was Palestine; and, particularly since the financial stringency has been severe, owing to the modest revenue of the country and to the prolonged delay, due to external causes, in the issue of the loan. But the improvements, limited though they are, which the people see proceeding before their eyes, have conduced to the popularity of British rule in many quarters ; and the better conditions under which commerce and industry can now be conducted have rendered possible the commencement of a marked economic revival.Building has been proceeding this year with great activity in most of the towns. A few large, and a number of small, industrial enterprises have been started. Jewish land settlement has made progress in some districts. All this is reflected in a gradual growth of population, in an extension in the area of cultivation, in a large increase in the number of agricultural animals, and in the growth of customs and certain other revenues. These factors have more than counterbalanced the unfavourable effect upon our finances of the indifferent harvests, due to the inadequate rainfall of the last two years, and of the fall in the prices of agricultural produce in sympathy with world movements. A distinct depression in many branches of agriculture has been the consequence of these conditions, and has placed numbers of the cultivators in a position of financial difficulty.Such, then, in their simplest outline, are the material conditions which underlie the political developments that have been, and are now, in progress.
The Moslem Elements.The large majority of the population of Palestine are Moslem Arabs, and among them a majority, possibly equally large, favour the general views of what may be termed the opposition to the present Administration. Three currents of thought combine to create and to maintain this opposition. First, there is the Arab national movement, which desires to see the establishment of a great Arab Empire, of which Palestine should form a part; a movement which was always hostile to Turkish rule, and which welcomed the British as the agents of liberation. Second, there is the anti-Zionist movement, which came into existence after the occupation, which is inspired by a dread of submergence under a flood of Jewish immigration and of political subordination, sooner or later, to a Jewish Govern-ment. Third, there is the Pan-Islamic movement, which commands the support of numbers of religious Moslems, which sympathises with Mahommedanism wherever it may be found, and feels it be its duty to adopt whatever course in Palestine may best contribute to the advancement of the common cause, paying only secondary attention to the facts of the local situation. These three motives intermingle. The minds of some men may be more influenced by one, of some by another. The majority of the Moslems of Palestine are probably moved, in greater or less degree, by all three.The Opposition Party is composed, like all parties, of men of different standards of sincerity and zeal. There is a nucleus of genuine patriots, who would be willing to make considerable sacrifices for their cause. There are a number of young men and a certain number of women who take pleasure in the excitement and interest of a political movement. There is a large fringe who sympathise in general with Arab and Oriental views, but take no great interest in the matter one way or the other; they are ready to ciose their shops, if they are shop-keepers, when asked to do so by the Central Committee on some occasion of political protest, and they are willing to join a crowd in the street to speed a parting delegation or to welcome its return; but they are quite content in the long run to accept the established order of things, whatever it may be, without serious demur.In Palestine, as elsewhere in the Arab world, there is much dissension between families and constant quarrelling between individuals. These disputes are carried into the political sphere, and the Government derives a good deal of support from groups and individuals for no other apparent reason than that leading opponents of the Government are opponents of those groups or individuals ; and, on the other hand, it has to face the hostility of the enemies of its friends.While it must be repeated that many of the leaders of the movement are quite sincere and estimable men, there are many others of a different character. Some follow what is at the moment a popular current, and pursue a course which they consider may gain them influence. Some are animated by personal motives of no worthy kind. I would mention, confidentially, that one of the most prominent of the leaders intimated directly to the Administration some time ago, that he was quite ready to leave the movement, and indeed to damp it down, if he were given a Government post. Another has presided at meetings at which resolutions have been passed declaring, inter alia, that no Arab land must in any circumstances be sold to Jews, he himself having recently sold a large area for Jewish settlement, for which he is now being paid in quarterly instalments. Arab landowners are indeed offering to Jewish organizations many times the area which it would be possible for them to purchase.There is also among the Moslems a certain section who take a different view from that of the Opposition. Their number is small, but it contains some of the leading men in the country. They are, in general, Arab Nationalists, but they recognise that Palestine cannot at present govern itself; they welcome the British Mandate and believe in the sincerity of our declarations that we will help the country to ultimate self-government. They realise that the accusations that the land of the Arabs is to be taken from them and given to the Jews, and that a Zionist Government is to be established to dominate the majority, are false. Pan-Islamism makes little appeal to them. They are anxious for a quiet life, and do not want to engage in political struggles. They wish to grow richer, and think that the Government policy is best calculated to make the country more prosperous, and themselves with it. Some, as I have mentioned, are largely animated by antagonism to persons in the opposition camp. Some think that they may obtain advantages, direct or indirect, by standing well with the Government. Some are influenced by favours received from one of the Jewish organizers, who has set out [9284] B 2
to form a pro-Zionist Arab party. Many regard the question of the Balfour Declaration as a chose jugee, and do not propose to waste time, energy, and physical comfort on beating their heads against a brick wall. All these make up what has come to be called the Moderate Party. As yet they have no definite organization. They have considerable support in the press. Whether any part of them would have the moral courage to stand up for their views, if it came to a political conflict with the other and far more numerous section, has yet to be seen.The Christian Elements.The Christians of Palestine number only one-tenth of the Moslems, but their education, enterprise and comparative wealth give them an influence out of proportion to their numbers. In presence of the very exaggerated ideas, which at one time prevailed, as to the real meaning and probable effect of Zionism, the leading native Christians joined with the Moslems to form, the Moslem-Christian Association to combat it. This organisation is in effect what I have termed the Opposition. The Orthodox Patriarch and his immediate followers, however, have always held aloof from it, and work in close harmony with the Administration. The Latin Patriarch, who has from time to time issued denunciations of Zionism, has recently been more reticent. The Greek Catholic Archbishop, who was previously one of the most active leaders in the north of the opposition movement, has now withdrawn from it. Generally the Christians have become more luke-warm. This change is due primarily to the growth of Pan-Islamism, and to the fear, especially after the Kemalist successes in Turkey and the concession of independence to Egypt, that it might have consequences in Palestine such as they are far from desiring. The change has been helped also in some quarters, and in a slight degree by the statement of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the real intentions of their policv in Palestine (the statement which was embodied in the White Paper, No. 1700, of June 1922).On the one hand, therefore, the Christians&apos; fears of the Moslems have been increased; on the other hand, their fears of the Jews have been perhaps somewhat lessened. The consequence is seen in the very marked diminution in their fervour in the cause they had espoused ; and of this the consequence is seen in turn in the conversion of three Arabic newspapers, owned by Christians, to a more moderate policy, in the extreme difficulty of the Moslem-Christian Association in obtaining funds for its propaganda, and in a general lowering of the tempo of the movement.The Jews.The remaining element of the population is the Jews. In number they some-what exceed the Christians. About one-third of them live and work in the agricultural villages. Both the urban and the rural population are increasing. One cannot come into touch with these committees, even if it were by a very brief contact, without being impressed by the reality and vitality of the Zionist move-ment in Palestine; and by Zionist movement I mean the movement to repopulate as much as possible of the country with Jews, to revive the Hebrew language and Jewish institutions, to emphasise the intellectual and spiritual sides of life not less than the economic. There are some, indeed, among these Jews who are also animated by the ideal of a Jewish State, but little is heard now of that distant goal. There are probably a few also who are by nature or training revolutionaries, and who wish to promote revolution in Palestine not less than elsewhere. I am convinced, however, that the proportion of these is quite insignificant, certainly not more than the proportion of avowed Communists in the population of Great Britain. All known Bolsheviks have been deported, and any who may have escaped detection are silent. A numerous body are the old-fashioned orthodox Jews, who are absorbed in religious thought and duty, and whose interest in politics is remote or non-existent. But the vast majority of those who count are idealists, inspired by the Zionist purpose which I have defined, but at the same time practical men and women in that they realise that the community they wish to create cannot consist only of intellectuals but must have a sound economic basis, that it must have land and houses and industries. They set themselves to work to create or acquire these things.Whoever visits the new Jewish settlements is impressed by the spirit that animates them thousands of young people in the prime of life, mostly of good education,  making  roads,  building  cottages, breaking  up  uncultivated  land,f
clearing stones, draining swamps, working in newly established workshops, facing in the cheeriest spirit, every kind of hardship, worst of all, in many places, the risk of malaria. They are encouraged by the knowledge that they are watched and supported by the Jewish people all over the world. There is no Jewish community from Shanghai to California, and from Amsterdam to Cape Town, but knows what is being done by the Jews in Palestine and follows every development of the Palestine question. And this has an important bearing upon the political situation here. The local Jewish community feels itself an integral part of a far larger body, and is conscious, that it is so regarded by the larger body itself. Any wound inflicted, upon it is a wound to the whole organism. Hence there has sometimes been a tendency to state the claims of the Jewish community somewhat higher than the local situation would warrant. The bloodthirsty attacks to which, they were subjected, in Jerusalem in April 1920 and in Jaffa and the district in May 1921, did not conduce to a more moderate attitude. They were prejudiced also by a certain measure of distrust of the local Administration, and by occasional doubts whether His Majesty&apos;s Government might not after all abandon them. But here again there has been a noticeable change in the last twelvemonth. The greater peacefulness of the country, the repeated declarations of the late Government that the policy would not be changed in essentials, its endorsement by the League of Nations and the passage of the mandate, have all contributed to a more conciliatory spirit. The terms of the statement in the White Paper already quoted have also aided this tendency. That statement gave rise to some disappointment among the Jews, for it deflated the exaggerated expectations that had been entertained in some quarters. But it was soon recognised to be both necessary and sound. The violent attacks which appeared in the Jewish Chronicle of London, with their accusations of abandonment and betrayal, had hardly the slightest echo in Palestine. The effect of the publication of the statement, with its very moderate definition of the practical limits of Zionism, coupled with the Zionist Organisation^ official acceptance, has been to place the movement in Palestine on a firmer, if on a lower plane, and has contributed somewhat to bringing the contending parties within friendly reach of one another.There remains, however, a widespread disappointment among the Jews with respect to immigration. Whatever their political or religious views, they all realise that the success of the Jewish Movement in Palestine is absolutely conditioned by the increase in their numbers. They know that there are tens of thousands of Jews in Eastern Europe who would come to Palestine immediately, but for the restrictions imposed by the Palestine Administration. They admit that such numbers might find it hard to find employment, but they are convinced that by hook or by crook employment would in fact be found; and in any case both they and the prospective immigrants would be prepared to run any risk that was involved. Meantime, in consequence of the Governments policy of preventing immigration beyond the extent of the proved capacity of the country to absorb the labour, only 27,000 Jews have come in since the occupation, and a monthly average of only 550 during the last six months.There is much industrial and agricultural development proceeding by means of Jewish capital and labour. Within the last four years, the Zionist Organisation and allied bodies and individuals have invested or otherwise spent in Palestine a sum which is probably in the neighbourhood of  4-5,000,000. Indeed, almost all economic activity, to which I referred earlier, is Jewish. And this process is capable of almost indefinite expansion. The country is lamentably empty and undeveloped. There can be no doubt that, looking only to the immediate future, it could maintain, without difficulty and without delay, double the existing population, with no disturbance or loss to any of the present inhabitants. What is needed is capital, enterprise and additional supplies of labour. It is the Jews, and the Jews alone, who are able and willing to supply all three. If funds have not been forthcoming as yet to enable employment to be furnished to a larger body of immigrants, the cause is to be found mainly in the economic conditions of Eastern Europe. With the growth of population, which is certain to take place in time, with the expansion of industry and the increase of cultivation, will come a steady and stable expansion of local revenue. With the increase of local revenue wdll come the gradual relief of the British taxpayer from the charges he bears in respect of Palestine.
Attitude of the Administration.In presence of these conflicting and shifting elements, the policy of the Government has been to proceed steadily with its constructive work, to the extent that its financial resources allow, not to be unduly perturbed by the vehemence of protests on the one side or on the other, and not to be tempted by threats of violence, or even by actual disturbances so long as they are not serious, to govern the country with a heavy hand. Except to secure the restoration of order after the disturbances of May 1921, I have been very averse from adopting unusual measures. Although delicate situations have often arisen, there has been, except at that time, no censorship of the press, there have been no political prosecutions, there has been no declaration of martial law, there have been no political deportations (with the exception of one man of comparatively small note, deported for a limited time and now permitted to return). And contrary to the practice often followed by Governments of various nationalities in the East, no one has been bought and no one has been subsidised. Not a pound has been spent by the Government in douceurs to individuals or in subventions to newspapers.Nor has the policy been pursued of establishing the simulacrum of a native Government, while retaining real power in our own hands. The Administration in its higher ranks is frankly British. Palestinians are introduced into it as they show their capacity; the number of British officials is being steadily reduced; but the heads of all the Departments and all the Govern orates are British. I believe that this course is not more unpopular, and I feel sure that it is administratively more successful and more useful to the people, than the opposite plan pursued in Syria, where Arabs ostensibly fill all the principal offices, but where the real power, as everyone in the country knows, is wielded by French advisers.I have, however, called into being a Supreme Moslem Council of five members, elected by the leading&quot; Moslems throughout the country, according to a Constitution framed by themselves.&apos; This Council is charged with the duty of managing the very valuable Wakfs (religious endowments) and the Moslem religious courts. It has been given full control; the entire responsibility has been placed squarely upon its shoulders, free from Government interference. Further, certain revenues, which undoubtedly are Wakf, but which have been diverted by the Turks, have been, with the sanction of His Majesty&apos;s Government, restored to their original objects and transferred to the administration of the Moslem Council.There is also, as your Grace is aware, a nominated Advisory Council consisting of ten official members and four Moslem, three Christian and three Jewish non-official members. (At the moment one of the seats of the Christian members has been vacated by death.) To this body the estimates and all ordinances are referred for discussion, and its proceedings are published in the press for the information of the public.On the whole, the policy of government with a light hand has been successful. The opposition movement has not been driven underground. There are no secret societies, or none of any importance. There have been, as yet, no political assassinations or attempted assassinations. The leaders of the Moslem-Christian Association have used their influence with sincerity and with effect to prevent disturbances. My principal officers and myself are able to maintain quite friendly personal and social relations with all the leading members of the Opposition. The British officials in. the districts are personally popular and wield a remarkable authority an authority which, in times of stress, is worth several battalions.Recent Course of Events.In the summer of 1921 an Arab Delegation was sent to London. This Delegation was appointed by the Palestine Arab Congress, which is in effect the Moslem-Christian Association. It consisted of three Moslems and two Christians, and it represented fairly well the views and the personnel of the Opposition. It stayed in Europe for a year, and, although not officially recognised as a representative body, it was in close touch with the Colonial Office and with many sections of public opinion in England. Efforts were made to arrive at an under-standing with this Delegation, such as would relieve the political situation in Palestine, and during my visit to London in May 1922 the statement, to which reference has been made, wTas drawn up in the hope that it would clear the air and perhaps conduce to an agreement. That statement, accepted by the Zionists, did very greatly clear the air ; but, although it is believed that the two Christian and one of the Moslem members of the Delegation would have been prepared to come:
to an understanding on the basis proposed, the other two Moslem members were able to veto any such suggestion.   The Delegation then returned to Palestine.Immediately on their arrival a Congress was held, at which moderate counsels at first prevailed, but which was afterwards carried away by the more extreme section. Resolutions were passed, which some of the members of the Delegation profess not to approve, but which they had. not the courage to oppose. Chief among these resolutions was one to abstain from all participation in the elections for the Legislative Council, which the Palestine Order in Council of the 10th August, 1922, proposes to establish. Another declared a trade boycott by all the Arabs of Palestine of all the Jews, to be inaugurated on a date which was to be subsequently announced. An oath was taken by all the delegates to execute faithfully the resolutions that had been passed. Nevertheless, nothing more has been heard, from that day to this, of the anti-Jewish boycott, and it is highly improbable that there will be any attempt to carry into actual effect so impracticable and so futile a proposal.At that time the Opposition were in reality quite undetermined what policy they ought or were able to pursue. The Delegation had been absent for a year ; they had spent a very large sum, provided mainly by voluntary or quasi-voluntary subsciptions; they had themselves declared that they had returned empty-handed, although in fact the Statement had made it clear that a large part of their demands were not, and had never been, rejected ; abstention from the elections to the Legislative Council was not likely to effect anything ; they had been strongly advised in England that disorders would hinder rather than help their cause, as being an evidence that the country was unfitted for self-government, and they accepted this advice as sound.   They were at a loss what to do.Two events then occurred which revived their hopes and indicated a course. The first was the victory of Mustapha Kemal. This had its natural effect in stimulating the Pan-Islamic spirit here as elsewhere ; although fortunately no disorders ensued in Palestine such as occurred in Syria. It also aroused hopes that, since the Treaty of Sevres was to be revised at a new European Conference, the articles of the Treaty which related to Palestine might be included in the revision, and, under Turkish influence, might be modified in the direction desired by the Opposition.The second event was the change of Government in Great Britain. The course of British politics is closely followed in Palestine. Every debate, or question and answer, in either House of Parliament, and every declaration by any political leader relating to Palestine is reported in the Arabic, the Hebrew, and the English newspapers. (There are dailies and weeklies in all three languages, and several tri-weekly papers in Arabic.) It was not known whether the new Govern-ment would follow precisely the same course as the old. There was at least a chance that it would not. In these circumstances it was decided to send a new Delegation to press their case at Lausanne and in London, and meantime to persist in abstaining, as a protest,&quot; from all participation in the approaching elections.The Administration had previously announced that a census of the population, combined with the preparation of the voters&apos; lists for the elections, would take place at the end of October. There was a political crisis on a small scale shortly before the date fixed, owing to a sudden declaration by the Executive Committee of the Congress that the census was to be opposed. Various unreal reasons were given for this attitude, but it was generally known that the true reason was that the census was a step towards the registration of voters, the registration was a preliminary to the elections, and that the elections were to be boycotted. The powers of the law were adequate, however, to deal with this obstruction. The crisis ended in the census being taken by general agreement except among the Bedouin, whose resistance to such innovations is perennial and quite unconnected with political considerations.The registers of voters are at this moment being completed. But I am not pressing on with the elections until the external situation has cleared. It is. obviously desirable that all sections of the population should take part in theelections in order that the Legislative Council should be fully representative--although there would indeed be compensations in the abstention of the Opposition, in that an assembly from which they were absent would prove less difficult than might otherwise be the case. It being our duty to give the fullest opportunity for the participation of all parties, it is necessary to allow time for the Delegation
definitely to ascertain whether there will in fact be any change in the fundamentals of the policy affecting Palestine. The Order in Council requires that the elections should take place not later than February next. The registers will be completed before then, and it may be hoped that the situation genera1 ly will have been stabilised. In case of need there is power under the Order in Council (article 87) to effect a postponement.Future Prospects.At the moment, then, we are marking time, waiting for the results of the Lausanne Conference and for a declaration of policy from His Majesty&apos;s Government.I will assume that the Conference will result in no substantial change in the status of Palestine as determined by the Treaty of Sevres, and that the future of the country will not be affected by Turkish intervention. The further coxirse of our domestic politics will then depend, in my opinion, upon the degree of certainty that attaches to British policy. If it appears that there is a prospect of change, the Opposition will be stimulated. The very large section which desires, if possible, to be on the winning side, but on no account to be on the losing side, will not support, and at a crisis will oppose, the Administration. They will think that there is still some purpose in continuing subscriptions to the Moslem-Christian Association, in helping to subsidise newspapers and in maintaining contact with Pan-Islamism elsewhere. At the same time Moslems in other countries will consider that there is still an end to be served in continuing propaganda in Palestine, which might yet prove to be an asset to the movement.The effect of such uncertainty upon the Jews would be hardly less marked.. In Palestine their enthusiasm would be damped; investments in new enterprises and in land development would be discouraged by doubt as to what the future might have in store; there might even be a financial crisis and a collapse of credit.. Abroad there would inevitably be a widespread and bitter disappointment, which could not fail to have its effect upon the collection of funds for Palestine, already attended by great difficulties. The whole economic development of this country and with it the prospect of its becoming self-supporting, on the military as well as upon the civil side, depends upon certainty as to its political future. Weaken that certainty and the foundation of the entire structure is sapped.If, on the other hand, a definite and unqualified statement is made that the policy expressed, in the White Paper of last July which amply protects ail legitimate Arab and other non-Jewish interests will be maintained, then there is some prospect that a rapprochement may be effected between the opposing parties.*It is of course possible, on the other hand, that revolutionary movements might be stimulated by such a declaration, and that those who hold that, constitutional methods having proved abortive, more violent means must be adopted, may gain the upper hand. But for my own part I regard it as far more likely that the opposite effect will follow.There is in the East a great respect for the accomplished fact. Arabs, especially, are naturally inclined to accept a definite decision by a ruling Power.. If the present Delegation returns to Palestine having effected nothing at Lausanne and London having issued a re-affirmation of the previous policy, the Moderate Party will, be greatly encouraged, the non-co-operation movement will be discredited, and the efforts which I should then make to promote a general, participation in the elections would be more likely to meet with success.Whether this be so or not, neither we in Palestine nor Ministers in London can say with any assurance. The event would show. As Anatole Prance says,. &quot; No one can foresee the future, not even those who make it.&quot;I have, &amp;c.HERBERT SAMUEL,High Commissioner.o* Perhaps I may be permitted to deprecate any reference in Parliament to the more peaceful state of the country as a reason why no change of policy is necessary. Such reference may be regarded as a direct invitation to make trouble in order to furnish arguments to the contrary. J
