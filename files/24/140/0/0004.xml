CABINET. War Charges (Validity) Bill. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade .There is one Bill, the War Charges (Validity) Bill, which, I think my colleagues will agree, must clearly be Introduced and proceeded with as soon as possible next session.   It is a measure for making valid certain charges and levies imposed by the Government during the late war.   The legality of one kind of levy was tested in the Courts and the House of &apos;Lords decided judicially against the Crown; and the result is that If the Crown&apos;s action in collecting theso charges and levies is not validated by a special measure, claims for repayment may be made which may aggregate  15,000,000, and possibly more.I should explain that during the war various Government Departments, in order to prevent traders from making undu^ profits by reason of war conditions, and also in order to provide for the regulation of control of various commodities, adopted the practice of exacting payments from traders In consideration of the grant to such traders as desired to avail themselves of them, of special privileges.and facilities which generally, but not invariably, took the form of licences by the Departments.   Particulars of the principal cases in which these various payments were made will be found in the Annexe,   As regards the special oase In which the House of Lords decided judicially against the Crown, namely, that In respect of the licences imposed upon milk exporters In the South West of England, Sir A * Griffith-Boscawen stated   in an answer in the House of Commons on 24th July, that effect would be given to that decision,, that Is to say, that the fees wouldSEGRET.

be refunded (involving a sum of about  130,000); but he went on to say &quot;The Government will forthwith bring ina Bill to legalise their procedure in cases other than the milk charges during the period of Control,&quot;    That Bill, acopy of which is attaohed, was introduced on the 1st August,and was printed, but there was no time to proceed further with it.    I now ask the approval of the Cabinet to re-introduce the Bill in the House of Commons as soon as possible next session; and when the measure becomes law, it will, ofcourse, be   necessary to make the refund in the case of the milk licence charges, which ha3 not at present been done.If the Cabinet should decide that it is impossible to take the Bill in the Autumn session, an announcement should be made, as soon as possible after Parliament meets, that a Bill will be introduced at the opening of the next session.P a LL    G .13.    lie22 *
Milk Lloenoo Charge.This was a scheme of zonal control designed to equalise the profits of milk dealers, as between one producing area and another.It is proposed under the Bill, to repay the amounts paid under this scheme-about- all the amounts collected under the following schemes are included under the indemnity provided for by the terms of the Bill,FLOUR, PRECLUDED PURPOSES, LICENCE CHARGE. WHEAT, EXPORT LICENCE, CHARGE. Prevented State Subsidy being applied to purposes for 7/hich it was not intended.    In the case of the former scheme, the licence duty was charged in respect of Flour to be used for purposes other than bread.     In the case of the latter it was charged to prevent the Subsidy being applied to Wheat exported to the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, and seed wheat exported to France and Belgium for the ravaged districts.       Sum Involved in the Flour Licences, about seven million poundsj sum involved in the Wheat Export Licences - twenty-seven thousand pounds.BREAD SUBSIDY REDUCTION SCHEMES. IMPORTED hSAT LEVY. Prevented inflated profits on stocks held or in transit on the occasion of an increase in the Controlled Maximum Price.    As regards Bread, this increase in the price occurred on two occasions owing to the gradual reduction, in two stages, of the Subsidy on Flour for bread making. Amount involved - about two hundred thousand pounds.As to the case of Meat, the Food Controller, as the
principal importer of Meat, found it necessary to increase.se the controlled prices to avoid selling at a loss.       There were some private meat importers whose purchase costs did not require an increase&apos; in their selling prices, and they agreed to remit 2d. per lb. to the Ministry, with the result that they maintained approximately the same rate of profit on their sales.    -   Amount involved, about three hundred thousand pounds.BEER LICENCE CHARGE. All Brewers were restricted to a fixed and equal percentage of their pre-war output, but in some industrial localities a demand for further supplies arose, and in order to meet this, licences were issued by the Pood Con-troller permitting the brewing of a limited number of additional barrels.     Theso licences had obviously to be limited in number, and the brewers who obtained them were charged at the rate of 25/- per standard barrel:     the profit per barrel was considerably higher than the rate charged for the licences.     -   Sum Involved, about one million seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds,HIDES CONTROL LEVY. Prevented middlemen from securing excessive profits owing to the abnormal margin between the controlled buying price of home-produced hides and the soiling prices     The controlled selling price had to be increased from time to time in conformity with the world prices which, after the cessation of hostilities, tended to rise considerably above the level of the home prices; at the same time, it was impracticable to vary the controlled buying price of home-produced hides, because any variation of that, price would have involved complicated adjustments of the various controlled prices
charged for the different cuts of the meat.   It was therefore agreed with the brokers that thoy should pay to the Food Controller the difference between their buying and selling prices, subject to a commission.   - Sum involved, one million,, five hundred thousand pounds .TRANSFER.OF BRITISH SHIPS TO FOREIGN FLAGS. During the war no British ship was allowed to be transferred to a foreign flag without the consents of the Board of Trade and Shipping Controller,,   These consents were only given in exceptional oases, and generally apeaking, when the ship was fifteen years old or more;    and a guarantee had to be given to build or purchase equivalent tonnage and place it under the British flag.   In addition, the owner who applied for the transfer, was required to pay fifteen per cent.-of the purchase price to the Exchequer. Owing to British ships being subject to requisition, the value of ships under allied and foreign flags was much greater than their value under the British f lagj and it was thought that the Exchequer should have some part of the monetary advantage obtained by the shipowner through the sale.   Sum involved - about one million pounds.LICENCE TO EXPORT STEEL. The Steel Industry was controlled and subsidised, and prices were fixed in this country.   The export of Steel was prohibited except under licence,  the fee for which was 30/- par ton, being the approximate difference between the controlled and foreign prices.   It is not known what sum&apos; ie Involved in this case.COTTON.LIPENCE TO WORK EXCESS MACHINERY. The Cotton Control Board limited the amount of machinery
that could he worked to sixty per cent. of the machinery at the Mill.,   Licences were, however, granted to work excess machinery on payment of levies which were to he used for the relief of operatives temporarily discharged as a result of the restriction.Tho whole of the money raised (three and one-third million pounds) was not required, and a Trust was constituted with the approval of the Court to deal with the balance (about one and three quarter million pounds).IMPORT LICENCES. When goods had been Imported into this country, contrary to existing regulations, a fee was charged in some cases as a condition of allowing the goods to be delivered to the importer.    Sum involved - approximately ten thousand pounds,HOP    CONTROL. This matter is being dealt with by the Ministry of Agriculture.
