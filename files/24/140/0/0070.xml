CABi-&quot;fJIT..reposed Legislation in India to amend the Criminal Broceduro &quot;affectingthe Trial   of Europeans.I have circulated to my colleagues, in casssssr continuation ofpi&apos;c &quot;^cr 21ispers previously circulated, a letter from the War. Office on Uo/ . -elating to the above matter.     put very briefly, tile attitude of t..e irmy Council - towards these proposals in their effect upon the priti.sM soldier is that they are prepared to accept the scheme advocated by. the Government of India,, provided that the proposed, Indian Legislation /reserves the exclusive jurisdiction of High Courts over the offence of ireascn, treason-felony, murder, manslaughter and rape,&apos;..when, those &apos;-&apos; jffences are, in virtueeof the provision of section. 41 of the Army -ivt\ triable by a civil court.     The agreement of the Army Council, nor/over; . besides being subject to the adoption of this specific amendment of the. Government of India&apos;s proposals (which,., as they stand, would wise the offences named triable by Courts of Session) is subject also to .the &apos;. understanding that no change will be made- in the provisions c&apos;f the,. Indian. Criminal Procedure. Code or in the- rules framed, under it,, w^ich ,.. jive the military authorities the option of trying by Court martial (instead of permitting trial by civil courts) any soldier who commits . any offence against the ordinary criminal law other than the five offences, specified above.     i have ascertained that it is not the ,intention of the Army Council, in making this second stipulation,, te introduce any general practice-of tryixg.30ldijers by Court ^art&apos;;ial- for -civil offences, and it seems obvious to me that -if any such generalpraOtics-
action v/ore to be adopted tile continuance of the legal provisions . ichmake it possible would ipso facto be jeopardised.&apos;&quot;2-.     my own view is that it would be most inadvisable to attempt to Criminate &quot;between British soldiers and British civilians-- in this matt .iar in the manner proposed by the -Army Council or in any other manner do not attempt to disguise the fact that the proposals of the Grovt. of dia will make a material change in the position of buropeans in India .. spect of their method of trial when charged with Criminal offences-it these proposals are a carefully balanced compromise, whereby for the i-rst time agreement has been secured in settlement of a -difficulty wl..io: fes proved insolubb for over half a century, and I regard the solution pund as on the whole a fair and reasonable &quot;one:.     But I thin-i it &quot;nest likely that this compromise will command general support, or even intain thesuooort of tho:e who have been -oar ties to it, if so wiue a [reach.in the principles underlying it is to be insisted upon&apos;, &quot;end that h favour of a class of the European population &quot;of India whicm in the nature of&quot;things has been in the past and is in the future more limely h an -an y other to come in conflict wivh the criminal law&apos;.  &apos; And even if iscrimination were to be made - in favour of the,British soldier, it woult e impossible - nor have the Army Council suggested this - to include in 16 discrimination his wire and depondonts, with the result &quot;that if the ;&apos;-proposals of the Jar Oiiice were to be adopted, there would be one law .&apos;,s regards method of trial) lor the soldier and another for his :/ife. 3i ,  The objection upon which the -Army CcuncllVs proposed iodificatlon is based is the anticipated Ofiects upon the discipline and Pontontment of. British units of the liability of the Bi it ish soldier who J Is charged with murder, manslaughter or&apos;rape (treason &quot;and treason-felony ay for practical purposes be left out of account) to be tried by an Indian Sessions Judges, even though&apos; the majority of the jury associated ith the judge (r::u all the assessors in the case of trial with thr &quot;id i assessors) ,r-re to be Z -rooeans, and even though an appeal is to lie Ito the High Court against any conviction,     my reply to this objection lis that it iSi and is likely long to remain, mainly theoretical.     I^enumber&apos;
iicial officers at their discretion, and 1 think it most unlikely; that ocal Government would select for the Sessions Juaacci-lp of districts.:an ch hi itish Troops are stationed any but a.British aedber.of.thsIndian il Service.     And even if an Indian were in. fact the -presiding officer r a Sessions Court before which a British soldier came to be -tried,:it Id be open to the accused to move the High Court to transfer the-case -trial to itself or to some other sessions court under section 52.5 of-Cou.e, on the ground inter alia that &apos;&apos;a fair, and- impartial trial .......do;, be had&apos;   in the court having jurisdiction.4. &apos; Ii, however, my colleagues feel that if the proposals of the -&quot;rumen t of india are accepted, coxae discrimination must be made in ur o.r: the.British soldier, then i would urge that the method&apos;of rimination proposed by the Amy Gouncil is not the Dost available. . alternative merhod suggests itself which would in my view be erablo,--namely -t:-at section 41 of the Army Act should be so: amended as to,-make all, civil offences committed by a soldier triable either by court-martial or by the &quot;competent civil court&apos; ;-t the option-(a) of the military authorities (as at present) in the- case of offences other than murder, manslaughter, rape,, treason and treason-felony:   and(b) of -the local Government if the offence is one of the five   j just specified.ea3on why I should regard this alternative as preferable to the     ? sal of the Army Council is that it would not, as would the letter,&apos; a statutory and inelastic distinction between the. forum of trial.for iii an and a soldier respective ly.wiien charged with one of the five ces. just specified, while at the same time it/ivould enable the.8 proportion of Indians to 3uiopeans holding tileae  ppoiht:iiieh.tfi;;&apos;aust mparatively -slovf.-. - Local GovernjiieiJts- are free to post their ySoldierJudgescoaiparat
Idler charged with one of those offences: to be tried, in case. oi. ,r.-.. dj&apos;&apos;oj Court martial by a method analogous to that at present. .... ail&amp;ble in respect of any offence other than those five. .  . The sacivantage of my alternative proposal as compared with that of the . ay Council is that it involves Parliamentary legislation to amend 3, Army Act;   but there seems some appropriateness.... in effecting by it method a change which is made at the instance of His majesty&apos;s ,&apos;emment and in fulfilment of a responsibility which is primarily at of the British Parliament.The /iceroy&apos;s position is clearly stated in the lo-roanying private correspondence to which I would invite my [leagues&apos; attention.     As regards, his view on the proposals as tney iect the British soldier, it will be observed that the precise form, alternative which I have suggested in this himite has evidently not juried to him, but though I -share his view as to the danger Of any septional treatment of the British soldier, I have little doubt t^at would-find my alternative less open to objection than those which hrs considerdd.
Speaking generally,. Section 41 of the Army Act makes tiro soldier amenable to the Civil Courts for certain specified offences, reserving others for court-martial and therefore makes-no distinction for these offences between soldier and civilian. It is indeed, difficult to understand why the military authorities are opposed to a change which has satisfied the European British representatives and has even secured the supnori-of the European Association.     This. Association has always been most insistent upon preserving privileged position of guropoah British, but yet it supports, in substance, the proposed alteration of law-, for the reason that it affords adequate protection to British from every point of view...     The members know the administration of the law in India, and surely are capable oi. gauging the qualifications of the Judicial officers, who will be empowered &apos; to try cases.     The European.-Briti.:h views, so far as 1 can judge them, are that this is a favourablemoment to settle once for all these long-vexed questions,, and tin t the -safeguards devised are amply sufficient to give effective protection to the British again? t possible racial bias, and taat it will be difficult, if not impossible, in future, to secure terms so satisfactory to the British, which would al-o be accepted by the Indian.   - Uoon this point I earnestly hope you will secure support of the Cabinet.     Let mo also add that Ian naturally most anxious to protect the huropean-British soldier..., against trie possible effect of racial bias,     I have thought out this part of the case with especial care, and am satisfied that British have nothing to fear from the pronosed oranges in Crmminal Procedure., and will be; amply protected against any possible racial bias in its administration.
Tole&amp;rem from Viceroy bated 13th De lumber, 1922.ip ar the . Line&quot;&apos;.-Private and personal..    Your tolcsran,: private -and srsonal&apos;,- 4800&apos;, da-ted 11th.     1 have now discussed the question itli Bapru and Hailey, -and: it seems clear that we shall not.,, &quot;v;hen e report to you-officially our views oa opinions of local overnmentsV have to -make any &quot;recommendation of substance odifying our original -proposals&apos;.    &quot;It is-possible that we-n^S &amp;r-motives of economy&apos;,suggestconf inlng appeals &quot;on fact/to ases in which racial considerations arise,, and we may possibly eve some/modifications to-suggest in regard to trial-of summons PiBes when simil.ar &quot;considerations &quot;arise.    I assume., however, iot -these points are hot such as you will desire to refer to 10 Cabinet.2.-   I-now turn to the two controversial points vrhich youLscuss in your telegrams,   - As to first,, the position of)mini&apos;^n--:sub^ects&apos;. -   1 think it is necessary to make clear what :believe to be the-position of--India, on the subject.     They&apos;will.aim&quot;that the exclusion of Dominion subjects from the status ofiropean British subjects:is not so much an act of reprisal, tuti instrument which India can use&apos; in negotiation w&amp;n Dominions-- .     - -----grant of full citizen status&apos;to&quot;Indians.   &quot;Ihus, I think that&apos; -f3 Assembly would probably not object to the - immediate inclusion[ .   -    - -      - -[ New Zealand&quot; in definition of European British, subject, , and md also&quot; probably make declaration that other Dominions should j included as soon- as they. grant the same-rights to Indians as tw Zealand;   but any&apos; proposal to preserve present status enjoyed, F sxampre,.by&quot; Africa or Australia would, I firmly believe,wreck
feck all chance of the compromise be in;; carried into legislation. I   c-: 3.   At the -sane time&apos;a somewhat - different situation h^s isen owing to our now having aspogtained the lacts regarding, unisrcial treaties with the S countries mentioned in your para.l. fe&apos; signatories to the report recc nised that their recommendations re subject to ascertainment of the facto.-    On this point,, it LI.have to be accepted that we must - retain provisions of ction 450 for dmericaas. and all Europe ens, other than European itish subjects,-for we cannot give arnsricans and Frenchmen a :Ter&apos; standing than Italians or Swiss.     Should we, therefore, Lntain Section 460, end at the same time exclude Dominion ?j.ects from status of European British&apos;: subjects, Dominion bjects would have no special rights and would be in&quot;worse sition than, aliens who would get benefit -oi Section 4.60.     This )uld prove; an argument against making any change, but it will u appeal to the Indians, who feel so .d3oply oh the subject of ) dominion action everywhere.4.   In.the&apos; circumstances I. suggest for your consideration-\ proposal that we should exclude dominions subjects from the jtinition in s.4.(l)(i), but give them the same standing as &apos;sons coming under Section 460.     -he Legislature would probably iwilling .to include.Hew Zealand in the definition under Kl)      and would ad so probably declare that they would be ling-, to include subjects of other Dominions in the definition ier 4(1) (i) as soon as they grant the- same status&apos; to Indians Hew Zeal and has: done.   -1-think this course would po ssibly be &apos;epted by Indians, who would feel that they thus nark their ise of the discrimin:.tion exercised by the Dominions against ^ end at the sane time retain in the hands of. the.Legislature iscessary instrument for negotiating-with the latter.   .. *b
regards Dominion subjects it --ould give the right to a European, majority on a jury where the trials were held by jury, or of assessors where trials were held with assistance of assessors. They would not, however, have the privilege enjoyed by European British subjects of being tried only by first class magistrates or getting the benefit of the new clauses referring to cases involving racial considerations.     In point of substance lessening of rights now contemplated is not considerable.     in all serious cases majority 01 the jury will be Europeans and assessors will be Europeans end there will be right of appeal to the High Court and in minor cases there will be the extensive rights of appeal which we now propone to make general.5.   A3 regards the War Office proposals I doubt whether they have fully realised the nature end extent of the safeguards which we propose.     I wisli firstly to state fully the alternative courses which have been considered by us.     The first is to amend Section 41 of Amy Act by giving concurrent jurisdiction to courts-martial in regard to the major offences, on the lines of the provision relating to Gibraltar.   This would of course enable us by rule under section 549 of Code of Criminal Procedure to provide that as few cases as possible should be reserved for courts-martial and to that extent the proposal seems a simple solution but there are,   1 the came tine, grave objections.     It would remove from the British soldier the certainty th-.t in grave charges he would be tried.by a civil court, secondly, we could not agree to such a step - without malcing clear to the as seme ?y vihat wo intended in the matter.     We. should then begin this diiiiculty.     If we unaertahe to exercise our discretion so&apos;that practically all cases -shall come before the Civil Court, we defeat object of the War Office since these Courts will now be Sessions Courts, and not High Courts.     On the other hand, if we take&apos;
9 the opposite course, we shall He under the imputation here that we f)thdrawing cases from the Civil Cuurts, and committing their ision to Courts-martial, in whose decision Indians have little fidenee.     Indian opinion would certainly treat the proposal to give rt3-martial concurrent jurisdiction in such cases as a retrograde sure, an opinion with which we ourselves should be inclined to agree. 6.    The second alternative is to legislate in India to provide that e competent Court for the five major offences shall, in the case of persons   subject to military law, be the High not the Sessions Court. This, the present proposal of the War Office, but, Indian opinion would sent the suggestion that trial in Sessions Courts afforded insufiicien&quot; arantee of justice, and would strongly onpose grant of a special status-rritish soldiers.     On the other hand, Europeans would, on their part., likely to resent the grant to the British soldier of a status which 11 be enjoyed by no civilian European British subjects.     There is, erefore, a danger of our compromise on the whole question breaking dowj ing to dissatisfaction of both sides with course taken in regard to th:. particular matter.7.     I consider in consequence that it would be impossible to passe proposed legislation&apos;here if&apos; either oi the two alternatives were&apos;opted, and would press strongly for the retention of the originaloposal.     It is true that, is regard to the five major offences, weapowered Sessions Courts to try cases which hitherto were reserveddelusively to the High Court, but the sessions Court has been accepted3 sufficient by Europeans out here.     The British soldier will be ableo claim a Buropoan majority on the jury in all cases involving racialonsiderations, and before a conviction can be had in the Sessions Ccnrt:majority on: the jury must have returned that verdict.,   . Where racialPnsiderations are not involved, he will have the right to a majority -ofiik-oPeans on the jury, when the case is tried by a jury, and to BurcpeanAssessors
lessors when tried with Assessors.     The British soldier will have j appeal, both on fact and law, to two Judges of High Court.   DeathIntonces can only be passed subject to confirmation by High Court.lotion 526 provides that, in cases-where a fair and impartial trialInnot be had in a Sessions Court, the High Court may direct transfer forlial before itself.     In that case, there would be an appeal, both onlet and law, from the. decision of the single Judge in the High Court toI Bench of the Court, a right which the British soldier does not possessit present.     There is no appeal as the law, at present, stands in theLgh Courts of Bahore, Allahabad and Patna, and though in Calcutta,Bombayadras and Rangoon an appeal lies to a Bench on a certificate from theIvocato-General, this refers only to points of law, not fact, and is   arovision which very seldom comes into effect.     I am advised that inases in which accuser has a reason to apprehend that ho would not getustieo in. the Sessions Court, the High C^urt would exercise these power?i transfer, which are much more frequently exercised here than inngland.     In addition, both Bocal Government&quot;&apos;and the Governor-General iiouncil can exercise their powErs of commutation or reprieve, under sections 401 and 402, and the Governor-General has further the prerogative of nardon under his Instrument of Instruction.     I assure yenle have gone to extreme length to meet your views and avoid bloc&amp;jdo&quot;?n of compromise.
