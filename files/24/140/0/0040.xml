MR.HERBERT SMITH:    I should like to say, Mr. Prime Minister, we hsve been rather disappointed et having to wait lor such s long time lor an interview owing to certain eventualities.    But now we hare the interview we hope we shall be able to pat belore you our position and the general outlook in the coal-fields. The Miners1 Federation took up a position that I think must appeal^eal to everybody as one of fairness, when they asked lor the stabilisation ol prices in 1915, and from the experience we have now we know it would have been to our benefit il it had been possible to have done it. but it was not possible and we went from stage to stage until we were controlled - Then the necessity arose to bring control about and we were controlled lor a long period. We iind ourselves In this position to-day that in the cosl-llelds generally we are over 40 points worse oil than we were in 1914 Irom the cost ol living point ol view; but in addition to that we have a large number ol our people who are getting lull unemployment benefit, a number partly employed receiving reliel Irom guardians to the extent ol about 5/7ths ol them.    These ought, we submit to you, to be properly paid, because an industry such as this ought to be able to pay wages which we, as oitlzens, have a right to expect, and we ask the Government that we should be paid as citizens and that we should be given an equal opportunity with other citizens.   While we have a duty to the country the country has also a duty to us viz. to see that while we are working we shall be properly housed, properly clothed and properly led and have an opportunity ol living a respectable liie. At the present moment we have not got that in our ooal-lields.    In going from place to place you lind a very changed appearance in the workmen generally and their
wives and children.    It is marvellous, In some districts, how they are living.    We shall probably be told that things are better in some diet riots - in the Eastern area, for instance.    But in that suoa they are still over 30 points worse off than they were In 1214.    Worse conditions prevail, as far as we are concerned, and we are asking you. to sit down along with us and oonsider this position and let us see if you have anything to suggest to better the situation.   We have made many requests and suggestions.    We have suggested means for putting our people into the position in which they ought to be, but they were not acceptable to the late Government, of which you, Mr. Prime Minister, were a member.    We think&apos; that alter hearing Our case this morning it is for you, gentlemen, to make some suggestion to us as t$ how this thing can be remedied and remedied speedily, because we oan give no guarantee that miners are going to continue bearing this unjust agony which they   are now bearing. We were told we must   -get down to an economic position. It seems that our people have got down below that economic position as far as their wages are concerned, and the consequence is we have to appeal to the &quot; owers that Be&quot;, who put us in the position we are in, by de-c^ntrolling us speedily and wrongfully.   We contend we were de-controlled six months before we were ready. We do npt use this as any argument that our fellow work-people in Other trades should be reduoed to the same position.    Take the r railway pe ople, for instance; we de net think their wages ought to gf back to 1914. We think their percentage is as low as it should be over
pre-war wages, but their regular wages are sealed according to the cost of living and ours are not, and we are serious in saying to you. this morning that the Government must do something to relieve this position. Our people ought not to go on in the position they are in, getting less food than they ought to get, being badly clothed and worse housed than in 1914.    In some nf our mining villages there are 5 families in two rooms.    You talk about high standards of morality - you cannot have them in these conditions.    If anything can be done by discussing this thing and. putting forward suggestions and settling it rouna this table, it is better than anything that can be done outside.    I have   been in this movement now long enough    to know that it is a wrong position to be forced into, having to fight where one party is well fed- and the other badly fed.    Both lose some feathers and we have come here to avoid losing any feathers and to ask you statesmen to help us and to put us in the position we ought to be in, in the position we were in when you took over the mines, we have a right to put that not as a request but as a demand, because at first our men went to the war as freely as any men in the community.    Jhey have now come back and they are in a worse position than they were in 1914.    As a matter of fact, - I say it now without fear of contradiction, - S went into the pit In 1872 and I never knew a miner Ts life worse    than it is to-day, and it is wrong. .   It can be remedied by a fair encj.uiry into this thing.    We have got down as low as we can get and lower than we ought to be and yet coal is being sold at high prices in big centres like this and in Manchester and even in Sheffield - which is quite near the pits.    It is marvellous what people get out of coal when once it has left the pit.    We should have an enquiry into these things and
see where they are wrong.      77e make our final appeal to you this morning that something should be done and done speedily to relieve the coal-fields in Great Britain.MR. HODGES:    Mr. Prime Minister,   I do not think we ought to leave you this morning until we have tabled before you all the relevant facts relating to this industry and I hope with your Characteristic patience you will bear with us even thoueh it may involve a somewhat detailed, presentation of our casejTHE PRIME MINISTER:      Certainly.MR.HODGES:    Perhaps, Mr, Prime Minister, you would like to loot at this Paper as I go along.  (Hands in Statement).    It will enable you to follow some of the detailed statements  a little more closely.    On the page you have before you, you see the wage position of the men set out as compared with the wage position they enjoyed in 1914.      You see that the present average was of all the workers engaged in the industry, that is for the month of September, on the September ascertainment,  is 9/- per shift, and that the wa?:e in 1914 was 6/5-ir per shift.      The increase in the cost of living, viz. 00.1 on 6/5-g-d.  should give a wa?e of ll/7-g-. - that Is if we were not to be one whit worse off - and therefore the average daily wage earned by our men is S/ll-g- per shift under the wage which would correspond, to the cost of living.
PRIMS MINISTER:    Excuse my interrupting you a moment. That implies of course that at the time you are referring to, your wage was only at the cost of living level.    You are comparing the two.-..JP   F03X)3R*    Yes.    lie are taking the actual wage for both periods and wo are acid in-&quot; the 80$.cost of living on to the pre-war wage so as to put it on exactly the same footing.     On this occasion there is no dispute between us and the Mines Department as to figures.      I am. making an estimate this morning, but I want to make it on the unfavourable side rather then on the other side so as to ayoid any controversy.    For example that 9 / - s .  from the Department&quot;s point of view is strictly 9/l.l7d. but as the Department&apos;s figures do not include the poor districts of Somerset, Bristol, South Staffs and Salop I have stated the wage to be 9/-s per shift.    On page 2 you will see how that operates in the several areas of the country - I am talk-ing of the big areas end excluding the small ones.     The small ones are districts where the data is not as regular-ly forthcoming, but the data in the big areas are sufficient to give us correct ideas as to whet is going on.      You will see therefore on page 2, Scotland,  No r thumb er land, Durham, S,  dales and the Eastern Division, Lancashire and N, Vales, the average wa-e given in 1914,  the average wage in September 1922 and the increase that that represents.    We say, as our President has already said, that in the main we are roughly 38 points below the cost of living level. Under the agreement was entered into.    This agreement was announced on the floor of the House of Commons as one that would mark a new era in the history of this industry,    It has been in operation now for practically 18 months.     For the first three months of its existence we were In receipt of Government assistance. The Government helped the industry to the extent of
 9,000,000.    From that moment on we have gradually got worse.    Three months ago we had every one of our districts down on the minimum wage, below which they could not go. It is true that since then four districts have crept up a little above the minimum wage, in the case of Scotland 1.1$; In the ISa stern area there is an advance, and a slight advance above the minimum in Durham and Northumberland, but generally speaking the districts are in that unfortunate position still. Worse than that, under the agreement there is a clause which provides that when the owners are unable to make their 17fg standard profit upon the standard wage paid,  the deficit shall be carried forward and shall accumulate as defioien-cies to be.met some day out of some future surplus when the industry is better off.    We have at this moment seven of such districts with accumulated deficiencies.    We have for example in Lancashire nearly  170,000 deficit.    We have in several places a deficiency that could not be made up if the workmen gave up wages altogether for six weeks.    They in fact owe six weeks&apos;   wages.    In Kent they owe practically three months wages-the deficiency is so tremendous, and of course it can be quite seen from the operation of this agreement that in Lancashire, U.Wales, 8. staffs and Salop, Cumberland, Bristol, jorost of Dean and Kent that no matter how the output improves during the next two or three months, there can be no advance of wages for these men,  even if there were prospects of trade improvement..   There is a situation unparalleled in the history of the trade.    An agreement has been in operation for 18 months.    Three months after its operation or at least four months,  the districts commence to go upon tho minimum.    S.Wales went on the minimum as far back as November 1921 and there they have remained ever since.    Other districts followed in their turn,and even now
nine out of the thirteen are upon the minimum.    You might anticipate us hy saying; Yes but the agreement provided that in such straitened circumstances the workmen were to be provided!  with a subsistence wage,  and you might $ell ask if the districts have taken advantage of that clause in the a.greement which provides a subsistence wage to the work people.   You will find the subsistence wage set out in all the districts, Mr.Prime Minister,  on the 3rd page, and you will see exactly what it means.    Northumberland for example has got a subsistence wage of o/9-g-d. per day; Durhan 6/S-g-d;    Lancashire and Cheshire 7/3d. Scotland 7/-s, Kent 8/3d, S.Wales and lionmouthshire 7/2d. with  . two dependents and 6/8d. without dependents.    You will see the actual number of days that are being worked by the men on the siibsistence wage in these districts.    N5Wales 5.4 days per week, Lancashire and Cheshire are down to 4.9 days per week.    You will see in the 3rd column what that represents as a weekly wage.    The subsistence wage in Northumberland for a full week would give 37/2d. before any deductions at the Colliery, Lancashire 35/ld. Durham 35/9d. Kent is up to 46/lld. 3.Wales 4o/7d.(with depend-ents) ; in the case of a single man 37/9d.    That is the maximum that can be paid and this is being paid in these districts. The subsistence clause, helpful as it is in a small measure in that it is an increase over the normal minimum wege, provides a form of wage which makes increasingly impossible an advance in wages for the other men, because this sub-sistence wage is added to the cost of production, and the fact that the cost of production is so    increased, by it, diminishes the surplus available for distribution either as further wages or further profits.    But it is a subsistence wage which at the maximum is so low as to make it impossible for men to maintain themselves in decency, and that is the experience in every County.,  even if they work full7 .
time.     With this subsistence wage if they could work full time the amount would still be considerably below the pre-war standard of living for them.      That is the situation in which we find ourselves from the wage point of view,  and incidentally it indicates the irregularity of employment in the industry.     The Government is aware of the great decline that set in in this industry since March 1921.     The Secretary for Mines submitted to the House of Commons a couple of days ago a complete table shewing the decline in the percentages from the commence-ment of the temporary period after the stoppage right down to the present day, but percentages convey very little to the average man.     They are a true indication of what has happened, and we understand these figures; but I think if it is expressed in terms of daily wages one gets a clearer idea of what we have suffered.    Before the lock-out for example in Scotland, we had 17/8d. a day where we now get 9/2d.   Northumberland had 16/lld. day they get 8/ld. Durham had 16/9d. a day, now they get 8/9d. S. Wales had 18/9d. a day now they get 9/6d.     In the Eastern Division it is estimated that they had 17/-s. a day now they get 9/ d. and the Eastern area is the best area. Lancashire and Cheshire had 15/6&amp;.. a day,  they are now down to 8/4d. ; and for the whole of Great Britain we had 16/lld. a day now we are down to 9/ld.   Estimating in millions of pounds and the wage bill in our industry is roughly  150,000,000 p.a. less than it was before the lock-out.     The question to be asked is, are we at fault?     Is there anything wrong with us?     Have we as miners in this industry done anything which has brought this upon us?    If we are in any way responsible for this situation we must bear o^^r responsibility; but I hope you will accept our assurance, Mr.Prime Minister,  that after examining all the factors pretty closely and making
allowances for our own short comings , we fin! that the factors that are directly responsible for this situation are quite beyond our influence and control,      Por example the first line of criticism that has been offered was that our output was low, while really on examination everything indicates t hat our output is rapidly approaching our pre-war level:.     Por week ending November 18th. it was 5,376,000 tons which was at pre-war level, and curiously enough that gigantic output is with a shorter working day and a lower average working week.     In districts such as the Eastern District the President informed me this morning they produced on the average in the Eastern area over twenty cwts. per man per shift in the month of October, which is the maximum output ever reported for that area, yet in spite of that enormous output the wages have only increased three points.
It 1b only proper to say that we have inoreased the number cf men on the colliery books during the last two months, and three months ago when we had considerable fewer the rate of&quot; output per person employed then was practically equal to the rate of output per person per shift worked in 1914*PHEL1E MINISTER:   Although they had a longer day in that period.H0DGS3:   Although they had a longer day in that period.   We have looked into the figures and I have been associated with a Committee connected with the Department which has been going into this very fully and I find that several things are militating against us.     j?or example taking the case of the wages   cost upon,the coal commercially disposable, the wages oost is just about 60^ higher than it was In 1914, but the other costs, embracing all the material costs of the Colliery, insurance costs, general maintenance costs, are at this moment 1354 above what they were in 1914.   It is true we must make allowance for all the facts that have entered into that increased costB    There are.costs such as, for example, the cost of the National Health Insurance, the cost of Unemployment Insurance and there is the smaller oost of the Welfare Fund.PRIME ILINI&amp;TKRs   And probably the increased local rates as well.MR. FRANK HODGES:    And the local rates also.    But there is a very marked difference between the increase in the wages cost and the other costs.    We have discussed this matter with the owners and we have made certain suggestions to them about these other costs, but I am afraid we have failed to influence them.
Por example, we take the -view that the buying of the materials for use in the Collieries might have been done on a muoh more co-operative basis than it is being done at present particularly in respect of timber.    But coal-owners are very nervous about any proposal which inaugurates a departure from the present method of buying.PRIME MINISTER:    It is just as much in their interests to reduce cost of production as in yoursoMRc PRANiC H0D5E:    It ought to be.    We have put it to them in that way but they do not seem to have -   I must be frank about it - they do not seem to have the capacity for co-ordinating their efforts in the interests of the industry as a whole.      I do not think they have got an outlook on the whole trade.    They look at the &quot;Sing from a pit point ef view and any departure from the pit point of view is resisted by them.    I have no doubt that many economies could have been effected in the internal working of the pits themselves if they had adopted some such proposals as ours.PRIME MINISTER.    May I ask you do they allow you freely to make suggestions of that kind,MR. PRANK HODGES: Oh yes,  they have never been able to impose any limit upon our capacity to suggest.PRIME MINISTER:    And whether they really take into consideration the things you suggest?MR.SMITH:    I do not think they take them into consideration, that is the difficulty.Mr.Stephen Walsh:    There are two sides on the National-Wages Board and these suggestions are made by ourselves.PRIME MINISTER:   Mr. Hodges. If they have the suggestions put before them and if they are really in their own interests I should have thought they would seriously consider them because it is as much in their interest as in yours
9 K oMR. FRANK HODGES&apos;:    In point of fact Mr.Prime Minister they did take two months to consider a whole hatch of suggestions that we put up to them hut in the end,  for reasons which they never adequately explained to us they dropped them,  not on the ground of efficiency or inefficiency hut on the ground that it involved a departure from tradition.PRIMS MINISTER :    They are too Tory/MR.PRAliE: HODGES: They have developed resistance to change to a very fine art; that is not political Toryism, however.How do we stand as compared with other trades. I know that people are inclined to make comparisons and they say &quot;Look at the Tin-plate trade, look at the Engineering trade; you are in some measure better off than they are in these trades&quot;.     We have practically an agreed document which shows how we do stand, in respect of these other trades.    The percentage increase on the 1914 wage is agreed between us and the Depart-ment as being between 40 and 42 per cent.   Now there are only tv,o or three trades in the country,  as far as I am able to judge, who are in that position.      They are the tin-plate workers with 34 per cent and the Shipbuilders vhich in one or two classes, for example such as shipwrights where they are 42 per cent. Steel-smelters are in rather the same category as ourselves. In several districts their increase is between 31 per cent and 42 per cent.     All the rest of the workers in the country are materially better off as Indicated by the Board, of Trade figures themselves.      It has been said to us that we must have cheap coal from the mining industry in order to get these other industries going and that wo who are in a basic industry are at the mercy of economic forces and none can help us.   That has been said to \xs.   We have gone into  that phase of it pretty
h eJ t.&apos;thoroughly,     v/e hare examined the figures in such detail that we can now see that the price at which we sell our coal at the pithead    to these industries., iron, steel and general manufact-uring industries tin-plate and so on, is now only between 2 6 to 24 per cent higher than the pre-war price.     It is true household coal is very much dearer, but we have anticipated this argument about the absolute necessity for cheap coal by way of wages in order to set these other industries going. We have tried it.     Has it resulted in any improvement on these trades?PRIMS   MINISTER:    Is it not beginning to do so in the steel trade?MR. iPHAHK   HODGES:    Nothing in proportion to the rapid decline in the price of industrial ooal.PRIMS   MINISTER:    I am told, by the people in the trade that for the first time they see an improvement.MR. i?RANK HODGES:    Yes, it is moving but these figures of price, the figures of the price of industrial coal go back beyond this period.      There was one period when simultaneously with the price of-industrial coal declining for these great industries employment grew less and less in them,PRIMS   MINISTER:    Is that not to be expected Mr. Hodges in times of depression, I am not speaking of a time like this but is that not to be expected when the industry begins to sag?.ICR. FRANK   HODGES:    Yes, I quite appreciate that it might point to that.     We have been urged to accept these low wages with a sort of fatalistic acceptance, because people have said, both on the floor of the House of Commons and in the Depart-ments that by suoh a process v/e would   stimulate all these other industries,     I believe to a very large extent that has been responsible for our acquiescence over quite a long time in these bad. conditions.
But after having suffered and done what the orthodox economists told us was the right thing to do and having reduced our prices to these industries generally to such a low point We find that the wo rkers in these industries are as badly off as they were before and we have not improved our own position in any way so far.    In point of fact there are no statistics which indicate that cur sacrifices have resulted in any real benefit to industry generally.    If we could satisfy ourselves that they were resulting in benefit to industry and that this was  just a mere passing phase and that within a month or six weeks or two months we should see some direct advantage from them we should have accepted the situation in a spirit of resignation. But we have accepted it now for over a year.    Over a year, and nothing has been done.    We must  say that we think a good deal of economy can ba effected at the pits themselves, by better organisation at the Collieries and we say that there can be a further stimulation of trade within the country itself if a good many of the intermediate charges upon the transit of coal were reduced.proposal.IH MINISTER:    Do you mean distribution.IviR.PRANK HODGES: Yes,  I mean distribution.PRIIJE MINISTER:    There is a Committee sitting on that. You are on the Committee.MR.FRANK HODGES:    I an on that Committee and I know that, as the President said, between us and the consumer who pays the high prices there is a terrific wastage which keeps coal at such a price that the  consumer always hesitates as to whether he will buy coal or not.    I am satisfied after examing the d.is tributive data that there will have&apos; to be some great re-organisation on the distributive side before the consumers can get any real advantage out of the sacrifices that we have made.SIR PHILLIP LLOYD GREAME: May I put one question? From what you have said the selling price to which you refer is to the ordinary domestic coal consumer not to the big industrial purchasers.
MR. FRANK HODGES:     The domestic consumers, yes.    The price itsell et the pit has been so reduced for industrial consumers as to he no more than Irom 26 to 34^ greater than pre-war, hut although we sell ohesper coal to industrial consumers, the same freightage has to he paid by the industrial consumer on the ooal that he purchases as by the domestic consumer.PRIM: MINISTER:     That is due to the railway rates?MR. FRAHK HODGES:     The railways rates.     Until the consumer industrial and consumer is allowed to benefit by the lower pithead price, an increased demand will not be forth-coming.     All that, ol course, is a matter lor enquiry end adjustment j, and in the long run perhaps legislation. I am sure, Mr. Prime Minister, you are never averse, apart Irom political considerations altogether, to any suggestions which would make lor a more scientilic distribution of this commodity alter it has been produced.     We think we hare your sympathy with us in the need lor scientific and efliclent production on the one hand and economical distribution on the other.   But that is going to take time.   I am sure and convinced - we all are - that it has to be done sooner or later to get the maximum results out ol our trade lor the nation.     I have just been reading some interesting documents which make a comparison between our coal trade and the American co8l trade.     We all want our coal trade in this country to be,within human possibilities, as ellicient and. as remunerative as the American coal mines are likely to be, but unless something on the lines I hare suggested is going to be done, we are not going to maintain our place as an industry in the world ol coal production.
PRIME MINISTER:    If you have it in your mind, what is the   proportion of domestic coal to* industrial and export coal?MRU ifRAHK ROUGES:    In 1913 we exported 7i% million tons of coal and the coal used for industries in this country was 69^- million tons,  that is,  industrial purposes proper.    Of course,  there are further divisions as to the quantity shipped for hunkers and public utility undertakings,  electricity under-takings and railways, but industries proper, iron and steel works and that class of industry took nearly 70 million tons. At the present moment, I think the figures for the first six months of 1922 are as follows, 27 million tons exported and 78 million tons used for all classes of internal use,PRIME MINISTER; I meant what was the proportion of domestic coal? You are only speaking with regard to the distribution of it.MR, FRANK HODGES; Household and domestic coal, it is 3d million tons per annum, that is in 1913; we havenT t got the figures for the presont time.PRIMS MINISTER: JBhat- is the proportion/MR. STEPHEN WALSH:    About 15$.MR. ERANK HODGES:     About one-sixth of the total.   All these things must be attended to and should be attended to speedily if we are going to take into consideration the progress of this industry during the next decade, but our immediate point is that, whilst we see what should he done and we believe that it can be done, how are our people going to live in the interregnum.    There is the problem.    I wish we could persuade you that the conditions in the districts are appalling.
PRIMS MINISTER:   You have persuaded us.     Appalling perhaps is too strong a word, hut you have persuaded me that they ai-e horribly bad - there is not much difference.MRo FRANK HODGES:   But worst of all, Mr, Prime Minister, there is no hope.     We have just had a report of the last ascertainments.    Everybody believed that with the magnificent output we are getting, we  should all have had an improvement in our lot, but despite the fact that output is at its maximum there seems to be no prospect.     Of course, if there &quot;were more  scientific selling of the  coal,, for example,  the revenue might improve within our own country,      If there were not  the great waste  and competition that is going on about selling prices within our own country, there would be improvement. .PRIME MINISTER:      If competition gave a   lower price -if there is any truth in the theory which I have always held, but which you rather criticise, that getting a low price for the product will help the industry.MBti FRANK HODGES:   Yes, if you have an effective demand, but with our present output we meet the whole of the countryTs requirements; in fact, we more  than meet them, because we cannot keep the pits working regularly,     In spite of that the revenue caning in fran the sale of coal, inland, is so inadequate that we simply cannot live on it.      Exports:, of course, indicate an entirely different problem.    In this respect we have suffered frcm the political consequences of the Treaty in our trade,      vie were before  the Separations Commission the other day, quite unofficially, but we had an opportunity of expressing to the Commission one direct effect of the reparations coal upon our trade. The French have had, and have been having for a long time,
their coal from Germany, presumably as arranged in the Spa Agreement at the price of British export coal, but the declining mark has made it possible for the Commission des Houilleres to have a large volume of coal at their disposal and though the French Government is not making a cash transaction of it,  they have to make a cash transaction with, their own nationals to whom they sell the coal.    They have sold that coal to their own nationals at an arbitrary price and the revenue they have obtained from that sale they have pooled and, out of that pool, they have given abate-ments to all the purchasers of coal from Great Britain, from America, and from their own collieries in France.     They have had a most elaborate pooling arrangement by talcing the money from the reparations coal and, so to speak, giving abatements to tho buyers of all other coal.PRIMS MINISTER:    You mean buyers outside France?MR. FRANK HODGES :   Ho.    The Frenoh buyers of British coal for example.PRIME MINISTER:   How does that injure you?MR. FRiXK HODGES:        I am now going to indicate.      They have fixed an average price for all the coal sold and used in France and that average price   has resulted in the French industrialists having coal at a price even less than our own Industrialists can have our coal,  low though that price is, and we say that the direct effect of reparations, as far as the French industry is concerned,  is to prevent the development of our own metallurgical and other industries in this country which would stimulate the use of our own coal within our own country. I quite agree that the French attitude,   judging from the expression of Mr. Bar thou at the conference,  is one from whioh there is not a great deal to be hoped.PRIME MINISTER:      That is in effect a bounty given by the French Government to their own nationals.
MR. FRANK HODGES:     That is my point.    They have created a pool out of reparations and, in fact, are subsidising their own industrial undertakings.    I think they have gone further lately and all this is having its effect upon our interests. They have subsidised freights from their own pits and from the ports to their own consumers.     They have an arrangement with the industry and their own State railways by which the freights on mineral traffic have been considerably reduced and that,  in turn, has meant a great blow to our export trade.PRIME MINISTER:     In the old days that would have been used as a strong argument for a big tariff.MR. FRANK HODGES:     Circumstances are so shaping them-selves that we are in effect the victims of a tariff.   The rise in the value of sterling, for one thing, is creating a system of tariffs against us.PRIME MINISTER:   As compared with overseas,  of course that is true.MR. FRANK HODGES:   I use those Illustrations to indicate how we feel that our own industry has been the sport of events and has been the victim,  to put it mildly,  of a considerable amount of political blundering.   Now we have arrived at the stage when we think there should be a great effort to put it all right.    I quite agree the question of reparations involves us at once in high political considerations, but the question of the government deciding that the wage of the miners is inadequate, is one that comes well within your sphere. We say, that you must help us to overcome these unnatural and arbitrary conditions that have developed in our industry during the last 18 months and declare that  our wage is inadequate,  that our sacrifices have not been reciprocated by the nation and all the other industries, that we have given far more than we have had back and that the minimum wage of the men must be&apos; raised.     The
proposition thgt we put to the owners was this:-   You must make arrangements to raise our minimum wage as that every man will have a wage equal to the cost of living.    That was our proposition to them.    They agreed it was desirable but nothing that  they could do could make it possible.    We say, you are the government;    the welfare of these four million people is in your hands;   we have no power except the power to refrain from going on in these conditions;    to do so woxxld bring calamity upon the natien;   we do not want to do it, but we do   think that it is the business of the government to see that after what we have  done to try to rehabilitate the industries in this cotuitry in the manner we have, there must be some reciprocity and the government must see to it that the le as V reward- for what we have done is a living wage.PRIME MINISTER:   Mr. President,  I have met most of you often, and I listened wi th great care to you, Mr. President, You put the case very simply,    I had gone through the case so closely that I did not see what Mr. Hodge3 could propose - hut I hoped he would have some definite   suggestion.    In reality, does not your proposal come down to this, that  the government must in some way subsidise the trade?MR. PRANK HODGES:    No.    It is quite clear that I made no definite suggestion as to what might be done, but I endeavoured during my remarks to indicate that the government must assume responsibility for the re-organisation of the productive side of the industry and the distributive side of the industry;    that is essential before this indu.stry can ever be properly itself again.    But In the interregnum we suggest that it is the government&apos;s duty to see that we get a living wage.      It must have consultations with the owners.      I have told you what the owners thought and the government should go into the matter with the owners to see if the Industry at this moment can bear a -living wage and, if not, then it is the duty of the government to see that some steps are taken by vhich --SO
FRIM15 MIHIS&apos;J?KR:    Some steps mixs t s e em a sub si dy .MI.. HODGES:    Hot necessarily.    You have the alternative. The French have adopted the practice of a subsidy. &apos; You can adopt the practice of a subsidy or alternatively, you can say, as you said between 1915 and 1918 that the coal must be sold at a minimum price.    There is the alternative,,PRIME MINISTER;   That  I follow but I did not think you were prepared for the Government to take the last step,MR.HODGES:    They are ths only things you can do in the interregnum.PRIME MINISTER:    I am very sorry that I feel my first meeting with you as Prime Minister will be a very unsatisfactory one for you,    I have gone through this whole problem since arranging to meet you.    I think   I had. in mind, nearly all the facts which Mr.  Hodges has given me.    I could see no remedy and I am sorry I do not see any remedy now.    Let me take some of the explanations as to the cause of the present situation which Mr. Hodges has given us,    First as regards distribution.    There is a Committee sitting on that,    I do think it is the business of the Government, if it is clear that there is a great waste going on in that respect, it is our business to try and take some means to put that right.    I   think that does come within the possibility of Government sction, bitt taking the causes of the evil to which Mr.  Hodges has referred,  I agree with you that the Spa Agreement was probably the cause of the break in the price we were getting for our export coal.    I have seen it stated over and over again in French papers that the arrangement by which the French were to pay a certain price was in our own interest. We ourselves broke the monopoly price that we were getting for coal and caused the setback in the very high world price, but I am sure you will all agree with me the break was bound to come, sooner or later.    It was
only hastened hy that Agreement.    The fall in priee was bound to come sooner or later.    It always comes when there is an inflated price In any industry and. when the break oomes it comes suddenly when people do not expect it.   1   think all the Agreement means was that It brought the trouble a few months sooner than would other-wise have been the oase*Now we come to the question of reparations coal.   Apart from the subsidy question I think if you look at the position as a whole, the coal going to Franoe under the Treaty did not make any difference in the world marketo    If the French gap was filled up it would leave a gap somewhere else.    I came across this in my own experience before the war.    The Westphalian Coal Syndicate had a disastrous effect on the British prioe of ooal where we were competin not merely from competition , but because they were aiming at capturing the market.    Some of you will remember that- They manipulated the price not according to the best prioe they could get on a particular day, but with a view of getting hold of the market.   That foreign competition was quite as bad as this reparations coal.   As regards the subsidy the Frenoh are giving, that, of course, is a grievance to you obviously, but it is the policy of the French Government and I think they have always been rather inolined to subsidise industryo   The fact that thev get this German ooal makes it easier for them to do it, but they could have done so without this ooal.   We cannot prevent them doing it.Then we come to what I think to be the vital part of the whole business - what is the chance of improvement?   There 1 do think Mr. Hodges is too pessimistic   You know that when a trade of any kind is going along badly a very small improved demand causes a very rapid increase in price.    I have seen that myself when in business in Glasgow;   I am quite sure if this industrial improvement in iron and steel of which I am told there are signs, continues, it will have a very
big effect on the price of coal the moment the position changes and instoad of the coal master going to the iron master and begging him to take coal,  the iron master will come to the coal master and beg hinr   to sell coal.    Ii Mr.Hodges is right that there Is no hope in that direction I think the outlook lor the whole country is most serious.    If we do not get an improvement in trade I do not know what is going to happen.    The atoeapc- &quot;prospect oi the country everywhere depends on revival.,   What Mr, Hodges said about the difference in wages in different trades is perfectly true, and I would be as sorry as he would to see a reduction in any oi them0had more sympathy lor them then lor any other^^7bi04*it5&apos;&quot;n*,because theywere relatively less well paidj^bjaft^l am afraid it is true thattill all^ig^rades,, at least, have been reduced to what they can af-ftfrd,,    I have an extract here from an article by ProfessorI thought it .wa-S; so brutal to the men I wtuug^ that I did not read it, in the House of Commons when speaking on Unemployment but I am afraid there is a good deel of truth in it;&quot;The industries that have progressed furthest In the direction of recovering their pre-war export trade are coal, woollen and worsted, end iron and steelo    It is noteworthy that in ell three case wages are adjusted automatically to changed market conditions;    In the case of coal the basis being profits, in woollen end worsted cost of living, in Iron and steel selling prices.     As e result of this wages wore reduced eerlier and to a greater extent than in other industries!!He goes on to    say that is the only hope all round,,What are the possibilities of Improvement ?   If it were really true that even better trade would leave your conditionsyou will not get arj^8-I**general recovery of business on. normal lines
as n aas they sre mw I cannot exaggerate the eztent of the evil.    I think with the higher cost of living to feel you are working and working so well on wages which sre so ranch, talcing cost of living Into account, so. much below the pre-war levels is something which everyone would try to mitigate. But when Mr,,Hodges compares your condition with some of the other trades - I have the list hare -you really ere, had es you ere, far better off than some of those who have retained a slightly higher wage   standards    Take the fitters and turners, iron moulders and pattern makersJ they vary from 44 to 48$ as against your 42$;  take the ship people3 shipwrights, ship joiners, rivet ters, they vary from 42 to 51$ there is an enormous amount of unemployment among them, in addition to having wages not much better than yours,,    If you look at that they sre undoubtedly worse off than you,    What can the Government do?    It is easy to say that a condition of things like that is the business of the Government to put right0    How can they put it right?    We are paying to-day   benefit to 1,400.000 unemployed, this is costing the State  100   millions per annum,,     How can the State fsce giving out money to help other trades when there is this amount of unemployment to bo met every days    It is a loot that with every effort to cut down our unnecessary expenditure it will take us all our time to make the budget balenee0MR,E0DG2SWill you help it by keeping the miners wages so low? BIKE MINISTER:     We were told In the Debate on the Address in the House that we have lost  500 millions a year In wages0 It Is perfectly true that if we could get hack that  500 millions spending power that would probably absorb the whole of   the unempXoy^ ed, but where is it to come from?   It can only come either from the profits of Industry or from taxation or by borrowing-.    There is no other-  way,,   We had prosperity during the war because wa got it by borrowing but we sre paying for It now with a national debt of seven thousand millions and the b cannot go on.    We cannot go on
indefinitely meeting it in that way,    I do not see how we oan helpyou.    Of course, I am quite ready to see the owners,  to put to themyour point that you think there is a lack of economy -which ought tobe put right and ask them to put their heads together and see ifthey can help you.    I em quite ready to see them.    Then as regardsdistribution.    That is another direction I think the Oov eminentcould help in, but 2. think you make a mistake in assuming that theconditions will, improve even with better trade.   You gave me a /&quot;Vlist of districts where there are long arrears to be made up. These districts represent 175,000 men out of the total.MRoWALSH;    The various areas that are in deficiency to the owners?PR^ME MINISTER:    Yes.MRoWALSH;.   Lancashire alone nearly represents thatnumb er.MR.GOvVEES:    And the others represent the rest;  they are small districts.PRIME MINISTER:    They are small districts.    Even since September as you know some of the districts have improved.    That means in these districts some if not all the arrears have been paid off.    It really comes down to this,  does&apos;it not?   It is a question of a State subsidy, and leaving out of account what can be done by economy,  It is a question of your getting a larger part of the profits such as they are,    I have nmade what enquiry I can about that.    I  think it is something which if you think possible, to take up with the masters themselves I have had returns of the number of mines working with loss to employers and I am afraid if you press that on the employers a great number of the pits will cease work.    I do not say there is no possibility there, but I think that, as you made the agreement, you should press it upon the owners.   Does it not really come to this that it is a question of the subsidy?
MRoHODGES:    It ie a question of getting a living wage for our people.PRIME, MINISTER: That is as rar as the Government can go Tinder our present system.    If we adopt a new social system, altogether and pool ever,^thing and divide it,  it is another matter, hut under our present system you know that cannot he done.    The Government cannot do it.MEoSMITH:    What we do expect is, that the Government having taken us under control, the Government should restore us to the position from which it took&apos;us.    Before the war, take the big areas, at our selling price then we gave our men 8/3d a da;/;  the selling price now is l?/6d.PRIME MINISTER:    I thought you said the present price of coal must come down.MRsSMITH:    I suggest to you it must come down.   You say you have returns of pits not paying their way, what about the pits that are more than paying their way.     Have you a list of the pits that are making big profits?PRIME- MINISTER:    .7ere these profits made before the present conditions?MRoSMITE:    Before the war , during the war and up to date, Every time you meet a colliery like this they talk about their losses. Take the Eastern area, as long as they get over l/9d a ton profit, which they never got before the war t do you think there is going to be peace.    There is no inducement to peace. Misleading statements are made all the time.       You have been given some figures about certain workmen and their percentage, You have to remember in the figures that Mr. Hodges has given you, that apart from cost of living, the workmen have to pay 150$ more than in pre-war days for their explosives.    You must get down to bedrock.    The figures given you are before any deductions have been made;  you have all these extra costs.    The
ave-rage colliery rents in areas I know are ll/- a week, I am talking about houses with two rooms up and three rooms down.    Then you talk about not having to pay for coal.    We use a quality of coal that the ordinary consumer would not buy, a quality of coal far inferior, and we pay for it on an average of 3/- a week, which we arc supposed to get free.    These things cannot go on.    We are not going to see owners making large profits.   You have given us a list of collieries which are not paying.    I am giving you a list where they are making larger profits than before the war.   You see their shares selling at 32/We know you are willing in certain directions to help us.    There is room for enquiry and all we ask is a public enquiry and let us see where, we    are with this industry. Whether I agree with you in politics or not, I always said this about you Mr. Prime Minister, you always told us what you intended.    You never tricked us but here you have a closed mind; your mind is closed against any enquiryaPRIME MINISTER:   Let me do what I can to answer that. First of all, the very facts that Mr^Hodges gave us, the fact   that there is so little hope of improvement because of the number of pits where the arrears are still due, show that as far as those pits are concerned they have not made profits,    Mien you come to the other    cases where there are big profits, once the standard is attained, you get 83$ and the owners only get I?$.MR.SMITH:    Which leaves us 38 points below the cost of living.PRIME MINISTER.    Then they cannot be making these big profits.MR.SMITH:    They are and the system lends   itself to it.PRIME MINISTER:    The big profits, Mr. Hodges, that the President speaks of,  once they pay their share you get 83$ of the balance?
9&apos;7 AMR. HODGE;-&quot;:    That is the position, hut even so, the distribution of that surplus to its maximum, with a maximum productivity per person per shift, leaves the miner 38 points below cost of living.PRIME MINISTER:   1 am not arguing against the proposition but I do say it Is impossible on the one hand to hold that the mines are making these enormous profits, and on the other that on getting 83$ of the surplus you are not getting a living wage, MR. SMITH:    They are not getting a living wage, PRIME MINISTER.   You are not but it cannot be from that cause.MR*HODGES:    No, it is because at the maximum point of productivity and after the sharing has been made there is/not enough revenue to give the workman a living wage, Mr. Smithraypoint is that he does not see how they are in the Eastern area going to increase their output when with a corresponding increase In output there will be a corresponding diminution in price.      The workmen as their output increases, are getting a less and less wago.PRIME MINISTER:   If that is so, what is the outlook for all of us?   If there is to be no increased demand there can be no improvemento If there is to be an increased demand,  the increase in prodtiction will be utilised to your benefit,MR* HODGES:   Does not the fact strike you like this.   If in March 1921 or when we resumed work we had been victorious and we had secured a minimum wage that was 8Q$ above the 1914 wage, all the prices and all the economy of the country would have been adapted, to that long ago.    The railway people have adapted their freights and everything else to a known wage and known cost of production. I illustrator it in this way to the colliery proprietors a little while ago.    A man who goes to cut a sewar in the main street,
on having his contract accepted by a local authority for cutting that sewer, knows in making up his estimates he lias l/Sd an hour to pay to his navvies, which is by the way a bigger price than is paid to a skilled hewer.    He puts in his estimate, wages so many hours at l/3d an hour, and all the eoonomy of the local authority-is adapted to it.    Vve made the mistake; ar rather, we did not make the mistake, the circumstances forced it upon us, we had to accept a minimum wage  0$ abnve the 1914 standard.    If we had been strong enough to say that we would have a living wage equal to the index figure of the Board of Trade as a minimum we should not have been here now, and what is more, I do not think it would have influenced trade one hit.PRIME MINISTER:    You understand these problems too well not to see there is no analogy in your illustration. The local authority can get what it has to pay out of the rates, but you are engaged in a trade where you are competing either directly or indirectly with the whole &apos;vorldB    There is no analogy between that and the local authority.MR* HODGES: let us take an analogy in which the Govern-ment is particularly interested, that is rubber.PRIME MINISTER: Is the Government interested in it?MR. HODGES:    It was the Colonial Secretary who endorsed the recommendations that the rubber plantations should be limited in their productivity in order to provide a profit for the planters. It is wonder aul how easy the world does adapt itself to economicrr eqiiir ements.PRIME MINISTER: What you say now is that we should try to arrange some pooling of price that will give you an advance in wages. The Government cannot do that; if it is to be. done you must do it yourselves, that is obvious,
MR HODGES:   We have acme our best productively to meet the nation^ requirements.    Suppose oar people thought as the rubber planters, that perhaps in the long run it would be better, to reduce production to a minimum point based on the country1s requirements and get the best price for it, we should be regarded as destroying the social foundations of the country.MR. SMITH:   Do we understand Mr. Prime Minister, that we are going away with no hope whatever that you are going to make an enquiry into this and meet us again^   r7hat I am going to put before you, not in any threatening way, is wa have been trying after the experience we have had, to pull things together and get this country into the position it ought to be in, but it is possible to try and pull human nature too far and when you do not feed people how can they produce properly.   We feel we are getting to that point and we want to avoid ito   We want you to use any office which is possible to help us to avoid this, to have a conference and get this thing settledo    I do not know what other people rs experience is, but I am 60 and I have had plenty-of industrial warfare, and we do not want it if we can get on withouto   We want sensible business people and sensible statesmen and sensible negotiators on each side.   People have said we have gone on so well together, but I say things cannot go on like this any longer.   During the last six weeks I have met one gentlemen at three different deputations; first he is a coal owner, next iron and steel, then a ship owner.    I said to him, which is your job?   You are hard worked somewhere 9PRIi-iE MINISTER:    The&apos;only thing:, if you think It &apos;&apos; worth while - the only thing that results from all this, is to ask the coalmasters to meet me to discuss the question Of possible economies oh the lines you put.    I am. willing to do that if you think it will help, but it is no use to ask me to do it if you think you can do it as well yourselves
A MEMBER:    What about the ooal mercharrts?PRIME MINISTER:      There is a Committee sitting; Mr.Hodges is on that Committee which is considering that and we must wait until we see their report,MRa SMITH:    Would it not be better, Mr. prime Minister, it is only a question of policy, for You to ask the two parties to meet you and put certain propositions before them and hare a talk across tho table and see whai happens.    We had better talk now than talk later On, after the events.-.PRIMS MINISTER:   Eor what my opinion is worth, I think you would be wiser to wait another couple of months at least and. see whether the improvement which is beginning is goingto matureo    I do not think any good at all would como from\AAT0my asking two or    three of you to meet ^s6 or three coalownersoMR.. SMITH:    &quot;Jill you tell us this, Mr. Prime Minister. You know more about the coalowners than we do, what   hopes are there for Lancashire, Cumberland, North Wales, Somerset, Bristol, and all those people ,to live for a couple of months? What hope is thero.    They are in debt and they are below the minimum now.PRIMS MINISTER:    If there were a rise in other districts they would be bound to follow. &apos;.ftiat you say applies, I am sorry to say, to many districts, but it is not true of Lancashire.MR. SMITH:    If things do improve,  our prices will come doizn again,&quot;&quot;ME.. STEPHEN WALSH:    I am afraid we are thinking in geographical areas and not having regard to economic oonditions.    The two counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire in many respects, are indivisible.    They sell an-enormous amount of coal Into Yorkshire through Lancashire arid
though the geographical &quot;boundaries are very well defined the economic boundaries are very difficulty  indeed you cannot define them.    It i s not a fact that when other areas   improve, Lancashire automatically improves; as a matter of fact, other areas have improved a little  sometimes,  indeed quite substantially, when Lancashire has suffered very seriously.PRIME MINISTER:    In spite of all that,  I think I am right that if there were,  taking a very optimistic view which is not justified, but supposing in a few months there were a rise of a couple ox  shillings in coal in other districts, you would have the advantage of that?- going to say/such a thing would not happen.   But a rise of a coupLfe/of shillings for a whole area is an almost impossible/proposition to establish. You could not do it7 /PRIME MINISTER:    I am not so sure of that and I will/tell you what I am going on.     I remember/perfectly in the/Glasgow metal exchange a man saying tp me when the   price of iron bars was high       &quot;It will,/never be lower than 50/- .. again&quot; and I saw it myself at  8/- in 18 months time.    It is too much to hone I admit, bxtt if there were a real recovery  in the whole steel trade and the blast furnaces, there would undoubtedly be a bigainerease in the price of coal.MR. STEPHEN-KViiLSH:   Mr * Prime Minister, may I point out to you that/We have had experience in the central part of England ,fbr five and twenty years,  on the Conciliation Board, and we know the  course of prices for a quarter of a century and, comme nc ing at^ahout+w^ nty

^llS^sliSftlStiSS:    What can I do, Mr,President?MR.SMITE;    I can soon tell yon what to do, adopt the Sahkey Report and. get us out of this business.PRIMS MINI STIR: When you have talked to each other about this have you not said: &quot;It is a good job nationalisation was not tried during this period of depression. 1 think you would not have liked nationalisation.MR.SMITH:    It would have been a benefit, as far as the eastern area is concerned, to have had nationalisation, wouldnft it?PRIME MINISTER:   You cannot expect me to agree with that.MR.SMITH: I am saying to you that we expect and definitely ask you to do all that is possible in this business.PRIMS MINISTER:       I am willing to do anything possible.MR.SMITH:      I cannot understand the position we are now in.    When we work we expect a wage and we are not getting it;  that is the trouble.PRIMS MINISTER:    I quite see your case - You are working hard and not getting any reward and you are hoping that the Government is going to give it to you.    I cannot.MR.PRANK HODGES:      You know the agreement under which we are working; it is terminable by three months notice on either side.    I think it is inevitable that if these wages continue, that agreement must come to an end; nothing in this world will effect its continuance if there ie no hope of betterment.PRIME MINISTER:    I agree, if there is no hope.MR.PRANK HODGES:     Therefore, is it not,a wise step for the government in these early stages to say -  1 Gentlemen, the conditions in this trade are deplorable; we have satisfied ourselves that the allegations you make about it are right
and if it is possible for&apos; the government to put it right they&quot;will do so, and thus anticipate the trouble that is bound otherwise to arise.    Is that not the proper governmental course to pursue?PRIME MINISTER: You mean, have another enquiry? I think that ,vould be likely to do you harm at this moment. Prom your point of view,  as also from mine, that would do nothing butharm.    It would prejudice the prosj)ects of recovery   at a moment when, as I believe, improvement is beginning.MB.. FRANK HODGES:    You do not dispute the conditions?PRIME MINISTER:    I do not.MR. FRANK HODGES:    !&apos;&apos;e gather that you feel you are helpless in the matter.PRIME MINISTER:    I do.    I absolutely agree with you, but then I look round;  I look at :.vhat I call my own City which is swarming with idle people usually engaged in shipbuilding and engineering..  That can I do?MR. FRANK HODGES:    I think, Mr. Prime Minister, you must really begin somewhere and you must begin at these basic industries, and the wasto must be eliminated out of this industry.icr. POTTS:    I put it to you that there is another wrong in this industry which has to be enquired into.    The accountants are pledged to secrecy while we know that collieries are soiling the ooal to themselves and we feel the wrong cost of production is being put in.PRD.dE MINISTER:    I am more than surprised to hear that because it was part of the agreement that ycu should havean opportunity of examining costs.    I don*t moan examining themyoxirselves, but by accountants you could trust.MR. SMITH:    You have got to toll those accountants curtain things for them to find out;  things which they cannot-find in the books.    Take one county which I need not mention: they have accumulated in a small area  50,000 for pensions forthe minimum in order to conform to certain formalities.    Thendeputies; take another case55.take the costs
Do you think we have not the right to  see what those costs are?PRIME MINISTER:   Mr-Smith, I am sur prised to hear that. I thought the good thing in the agreement was that you really did have an opportunity of seeing for yourselves.MR. GREEK ALL :    The accountants cannot tell us.     They are sworn to secrecy.MR. HARTSHORN :    I understand that each colliery has to supply returns showing the detailed cost of items, the cost under a given number of items, and also the revenue and the receipts from the sale of coal.      Those returns are then taken by the auditors and a calculation is made and an average struck. But we have this right:   the auditors have the right to take any of Hiose returns,  take half a dozen of them, and say, &quot;We will go to the books and see whether those returns are properly made out&quot;.     They can take test audits of that kind and when those test audits are made we can say to our auditor.,  &quot;We should like you to find out this,  or that&quot;, and1, they can then obtain any information we want.PRIME MINISTER:    Is that correct?MR. FRANK HODGES :     After examining the accounts if there were found to be a discrepancy or an error or a fake in the accounts, they would only be able to tell us the fact and would never be able to tell us which particular colliery it was that had been guilty of it.   They must never reveal the business of any single colliery company.PRIME MINISTER:    I think from Mr.Hart shorn1 s statement that would seem to be a better means of getting at the facts than by a Commission.     That is surely something you could deal with.MR. PRANK HODGES:   We should be able to deal with that, I have no doubt,  at the Board itself.
MB. SMITH:    I suggest to you that you ought to have an enquiry into this industry as to its production and its distribution.PRIME MINISTER;    I myself am convinced that an enquiry would upset things when there is a chance of improvement at this moment;  that is my opinion-    If after the House meets again you still wish to press definitely upon me to have an enquiry, I will consider it, but I think at present it is not advisable.  ,,.I:-.,aia:r&apos;:punaingconsidera-ble risk in- saying ,.*tha--tv:^MR.
