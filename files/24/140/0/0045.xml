GERMANY.CONFIDENTIAL.( Y &apos; A-it?[December 5.jSection 1.[C 1664=0/99/18]No. 1.Memorandum on the Attitude of the French, Belgian and Italian Governments to the latest Developments in the Reparation Negotiations.THE present stage of the reparation negotiations dates from the receipt of the German request of the 12th July 1922, for the suspension, during the remainder of the year and during 1923 and 1924, of all cash payments other than monthly sums of 500,000L on account of the Clearing Office payments, and a sum of about 300 millions of gold marks (15,000,0001. gold) still due at the time against the 1922 payments.2. So far as can be gathered from a statement made by M. Poincare at the London Conference in August and from various inspired statements in the French press, the French Government originally intended to meet the German request of the 12th July, with a proposal. (a.) That the German reparation debt should be reduced to 50,000 millions of gold marks (2,500,000,OOOL gold) by means of the cancellation of the so-called &quot; C&quot; reparation bonds, amounting to some 80,000 millions of gold marks (4,000,000,OOOZ. gold) in return for the immediate cancellation of the whole; of the European Inter-Allied debt and the eventual reduction or cancellation of the American debt.(fe.) That Allied control of German budgetary operations should be tightened up with the object of stabilising the mark at the earliest possible moment.3. When, however, on the 1st August, the Balfour note made it clear that repayment of the Allied debts to Great Britain would henceforth have to be made in proportion to the demands made upon Great Britain by the United States, the attitude of the French Government towards the collection of the reparation debt from Germany defined itself very differently. M. Poincare stated at the London Conference that, in view of &quot; recent developments&apos;&apos; (i.e., the Balfour note), there could now be no question, so far as the French Government were concerned, of any further moratorium to Germany without the taking by the Allies of &quot; productive pledges,&quot; upon the security of which a reconstruction loan could be raised. M. Poincare further made it clear that, if France had her way, she would take the Ruhr as a &quot; productive pledge&quot; and that his only object in suggesting less far-reaching &quot; pledges &quot; was to meet the wishes of the Allies. The &quot; pledges &quot; suggested by M. Poincare in August comprised Allied control of the whole of the German customs in addition to the establishment by the Allies of a customs barrier between occupied and unoccupied Germany and around the Ruhr basin ; the levy and retention by the Allies of certain taxes in occupied territory and the delivery to the Allies of certain State mines and forests, and of a percentage of the share capital of certain factories in occupied territory.4. The attitude of the Belgian and the Italian Governments at the London Conference was on the whole non-committal. They doubted whether from the financial point of view the &quot;pledges&quot; which M. Poincare desired to.take would be particularly &quot;productive.&quot; They did not, however, commit themselves definitely either to the British or French standpoints, upon the difference between which the London Conference broke up.5. When the question of the 1922 payments was referred to the Reparation Commission, however, the Belgian representative adopted a very helpful attitude, and it was entirely owing to the readiness of the Belgian Government to accept German Treasury bonds in lieu of the cash payments which would otherwise have fallen to the: Belgian share that a settlement of the 1922 payments was reached on the 31st August. The only contribution of the Italian Government to the sohition of this part of the question was a proposal, made on M. Schanzer&apos;s authority by the Italian Ambassador in London on the 22nd August, that the British and Italian Governments should together protest to the French Government against what was supposed to-be the latteFs-iutention to take violent action in Germany.[182 e-1]
6. The submission. to the Reparation Commission of the Bradbury scheme of the 4th October, 1922 (proposing in return for the stabilisation of the mark the grant of a virtual four years&apos; moratorium) provoked a storm of protest in the French press. The &quot; Temps&quot; enquired why His Majesty&apos;s Government had taken this &quot; initiative in favour of Germany.&quot; The Barthou proposals, which were submitted to the Reparation Commission very soon after the presentation of the Bradbury proposals, were limited to the advocacy of the imposition by the Allies of stricter financial control upon the German Government. It was specifically stated that the questions of the moratorium and of the taking of &quot; pledges &quot; were matters for the meeting of the Allied Governments for which the French Government had been pressing since early in September.7. The Barthou proposals were none too favourably received in the Nationalist sections of the French press, an d the &quot; Echo de Pa ris &quot; and the &quot; Temps &quot; pleaded that the condition of a moratorium must be the taking of &quot; productive pledges&quot; rather than the imposition of a stricter financial control. Even in the more moderate section of the French Chamber a statement was made that it was only the threat of an occupation of the Ruhr and the taking of &quot; productive pledges&quot; which would bring the German industrials to their senses.8. At the end of October the &quot;Journal des D^bats,&quot; on the eve of the Reparation Commission^ visit to Berlin, stated that unless a joint Allied policy could be found to make Germany pay, France would have to act alone.9. On the 7th November attention was drawn in a speech by M. Loucheur to a somewhat different aspect of reparation, that of its bearing on French security. M. Loucheur pointed out that the payment of reparation would, by developing Germany&apos;s exports, make Germany stronger. The safety of France would therefore actually be prejudiced by the payment of reparation. The best means of neutralising this danger would be the promotion of an autonomous Rhineland which might be secured by the removal of the Prussian functionaries and the conferment of military supervision of the Rhineland upon the League of Nations after the cessation of the Allied occupation.]0. On the 11th November M. Poincare warned the French Chamber that the policy of &quot;pledges&quot; would not necessarily bring in immediate cash. It was the coercive effect of the &quot; pledges &quot; upon Germany which was important. &quot; Pledges,&quot; if taken without Allied co-operation, would be less effective ; none the less, France might have to take them alone.11. By the middle of November, then, it was fairly clear that in default of some unexpected alteration in the general situation of the reparation a,nd inter-Allied debt questions, the French Government intended to press upon the Allies the taking of &quot; pledges &quot; in the Rhineland and in the Ruhr, not for the immediate financial value of these pledges, but for the sake of their coercive effect upon Germany and for that of their economic and military value in the event of continued German recalcitrance. There was, moreover, a possibility that, in the event of continued Allied refusal to accept the French proposals, M. Poincare, hoping to strengthen his parliamentary position (which is believed to be somewhat insecure) would decide to act alone.12. It is evident that the Belgian Government viewed these developments with considerable alarm. At the beginning of September, at the time of the conclusion of the Stinnes-Lubersac Agreement for facilitating deliveries in kind between Germany and France, the Belgian Ambassador in London hinted that Belgium did not welcome any development likely to strengthen French influence in the occupied Rhineland or in Western Germany. The Belgian Government appear to be afraid that such extension of French influence would imply the economic encirclement of Belgium by France, and the consequent ultimate dependence of Belgian industry on French favour. This fear appears to be reinforced by doubts as to the attitude of the Belgian socialists in the event of violent action b)^ France and by a natural disinclination to risk, as the result of fresh measures of violence and new disorganisation of Belgian trade. But there is none the less no reason to suppose that, in the event of the French deciding to act, the Belgians would hesitate to follow them. Almost all the evidence is to the contrary.13. On the 24th November M. Poincare developed his plans to the Belgian Prime Minister, plans which apparently included the occupation of Essen as a means of controlling the Ruhr pending the reconstruction of German finance, and in certain circumstances Allied &quot; organisation &quot; of the Rhineland. The Belgian Prime Minister reported what had passed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels. In order to avoid the actual materialisation of the French plans, which he made it clear that the Belgian
Government would not openly resist, he reverted to something not unlike the original proposals which the French Government apparently had in mind in July, before the despatch of the Balfour note. The proposals which the Belgian Prime Minister made were :-(a.) Some declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government respecting cancellation of inter-Allied indebtedness, presumably in order to make it possible for M. Poincare to agree to reduction of total of German reparation debt.(b.) Some immediate payment by Germany by means apparently of a loan and of Allied participation in German share capital.14. The Italian Government have not so far declared themselves on the French proposals beyond a somewhat vague statement made to the press by M. Mussolini at Lausanne to the effect that &quot; France is right in being dissatisfied with the peace, for Germany is determined not to pay her, and is menacing both for France and Italy. Public opinion will probably force France to proceed to action which will probably be too late to give her satisfaction she deserves, and she will be confronted by Germany with Bolshevik B,us%ia behind her. The only hope of saving Europe from decomposition lies in close alliance between Belgium. France, Italy and England, if the latter understands her true interests.&quot;Foreign Office, December 5, 1 922.
