o C 9- jTHB OOMMPNIS?TSThe Political Bureau of the -Communist Party decided at a meeting on December 2nd to urge George L&amp;lansbury to form a left ?^ing in the Labour Party in opposition to Eamsuy McDonald:    J.W. Mr-ir, late of the Socialist Labour Pwrty and formerly editor of the &quot;Socialist&quot;, was to be &quot;angled for&quot; and Ilewbold was instructed to obtain the sympathy of Labour Heubers of Parliament -with ooiamunist tendencies,J. T. Walton Hewbcld has acknowledged the receipt of 80 from his election agent,  &quot;for personal expenses inconnection with the election campaign&quot;:   he seems to findParliamentary life somewhat trying, for he informed J.E.Campbell on December 7th that &quot;we keep such hellish hoursthat between preparing speeches and whipping my own party  don&apos;t feel fresh enough just now to...send you an article&quot;and added &quot;Davsy (i.e. Dirvid Kirkwood ) i3 settling I thinkunder Vvheatlej? under B&amp;msay and I want to gyp him&quot;.    The:,Mancheeter Guardian&quot; of December 7th contained a long letter in which Hewbold stated that:&quot;It is strange to hear Mx. Kirkwood repudiating that creed of Bolshevism which, speaking In Motherwell some years ago, ha so emphatically avowed.    Ho &amp;as discovered that he has got a country.    Ho is going the same way, it would seam, as Gustavo Serve.    It is but a stage from the declamation *My country first, God bless it&apos; to the rhodomontade of the recruiting platform. *Your Zing and Country need youJ&apos;...   Be refuses, he says, to be dictated to from Moscow.    Ee is,  indeed, well on the way to embrace the complete cult of social patriotism.    Implicitly, he is disowning his internationalism.   Ee has moved very rapidly.    He has gone politically even farther than he has gone geographically since he left the banks of the Clyde for the shores of the Thames...&quot;I am frankly, freely, and of my own unfettered and unprompted volition a disciplined member of the Communist International.    I heve never allowed my constituents to have any illusions about the matter ofmy/
my supporters, or attempted in any way to conceal the fact...    The ComiTrunist International Is made up of the Communist parties of the respective countries-, . all,of them accepting without equivocation or contracting out the statutes and theses passed by the accredited delegates of all those parties attending the conference of the International.&quot;The Chief Constable of Edinburgh informs me that Newbold, addressing a communist meeting in that city on December 10th said that he had come to Edinburgh to obtain Information at Parliament House regarding the &quot;Emigrating Companies&quot; as there was a &quot;move by the present Government to emigrate the unemployed of this country to the land in Canada and Queensland&quot;.On December 9th the Industrial Committee of theCommunist Party sent an urgent whip to officials in the relevant areas regarding the forthcoming special conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain;&quot;The Minors&apos; Federation of Great Britain are holding a special conference at southport on Docerabar 21st to consider the present situation in the coalfields.&quot;The Industrial Committee would be glad if you would inform them whether any Pert;? in your area are likely to be attending that Conference.       If so, please fonward their names and addresses, at once.&quot;The Executive are now considering what policy is the best one for our members to ptirsue at this conference, and have instructed the Industrial Committee to establish immediate contact with cur members in all the mining districts.    Will you arrange for some comrade to immediately send the committee a review of the condition in each district and the feeling of the rank and file towards this Conference-:    also their views as to the line of policy that should be pursued.&quot;I need not urge upon you the importance of this matter.    The Executive Committee is anxious to formulate its policy as a result of having the fullest information from the field of action.&quot;E.W. Cant, the organising secretary of the london district P^rty Committee, has sent the following circular,dated December 8th, to certain selected communists^&quot;The newly elected London District party Committee is in process of establishing the various departments which are required to give effect to theproposals/
proposals adopted by the Battersea Conference.&quot;Amongst the departments is an Industrial Department which will have charge ol carrying into effect the Party policy in Trades Unions end Trades Councils, etc.&quot;This Committee will aot under the leadership of comrade A.H. Hawkins for the Political Bureau, and I am directed to invite you to become a member-..&quot;It is anticipated that the work of the Committee will fully occupy at least two evenings per week of each member, &quot;the members being expected to become working members, that is, seeing that the decisions are given practical effect to...&quot;W. GAUaeher is now working with Hannington and Eteye on behalf of the unemployed marchers:    officially he has not the support of the Communist party but &quot;has the Party&apos;s sympathy and good wishes behind him.&quot;The &quot;Labour Defence Committee!r has circularised various communist secretaries regarding &quot;meetings of protest against the south African executions and on working class persecutions generally&quot;:    the committee has, however, no funds to pay the expenses of their speakers, so it is unlikely that much will cone of the proposal at present.THE KB3D IE?TBPJv AT IONAL Off LABOUR UTTIO^jIn &quot;The Worker&quot; of December 9th H&amp;rry Pollittstates that:&quot;It iy now two years since the campaign on behalf of the Pad International of Labour Unions was commenced in Britain.    During that time it is no idle boast to declare that more propaganda of a a definite and practical character has bean carried out inside the unions by the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions than by any of the many bodies thrown up out of tho industrial movement.&quot;The question of affiliation to the Red International of Labour Unions has been   discussed at many delegate meetings of the larger unions.   We have not carried the day as yet, but we have made the question of International trade union organisation a - practical question inside the unions.    Amongst the unions who have discussed this question at their annual conferences the following can be mentioned:    The United Vehicle Workers, the Rational Union ofDistributive/
Distributive and..Allied Workers, Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, the Packing Case Makers, the Dundee Jute Wo rke rs...&quot;In this connection it is of interest to note thatNat W&amp;tkins, who is in Moscow has informed Tom Quelchthat:&quot;I am rather pleased with the note contairsd in 2inoviev&apos;s report regarding tbe Prof intern wcx.lt and its relative&apos; importance to the revolutionary movement.    Internationally I can assure you thar, there is no talk of liquicatior but rather the contrary the concentration of greater attention to this phase of the work in future.&quot;There have for some time been indications that Moscow attaohes increasing importance to communist work inside the trade unions, as distinct from purely polit2)tf*l communist propaganda.   As evidence of the continual influx of Bolshevik literature, mention may be made of the fact that on December 6th the dispatch of 5,000 copies of Ho.l of the bulletin of the International Working Union of the Revolutionary Miners&quot; was notified to a member of the British Bureau of the Red International of labour Unions by Reinhardt, of the Mid -European Bureau.It is reported that on October 17th the ITew South Wales labour Counoil debated the question of Inviting Tom Mann to visit Australia:   it was subsequently stated that the Council would grant  130 to cover his travelling and living expenses and a committee of three was appointed to make the necessary arrangements:   he is to lecture and to &quot;work in the industrial movement1&quot;.A 35ITISH COMMUI?ISTTS EXPERIENCES IK RUSSIAHut Watkins, one of the British delegates to the recent Red International of Labour Unions congress, has written the following account of his experiences:   his report, despite propaganda nature, clearly indicates theefforts/
efforts made &quot;by the Soviet Government to impress foreigndelegates and is to be published in one of the British revolutionary papers:*&quot;Russian Demonstration&quot;She greatest privilege of the delegates to the Fourth Congress of the Communist   International was to participate in the super-mighty demonstration held in Petrograd and Moscow, to celebrate the Fifth Anniversary of the October Revolution in EuesIu.&quot;Although the Fourth Congress v;a, to be held in the large Hall of the Kremlin in Moscow, at the special request of the Petrograd workers the opening session was to be held in the Grand Theatre in Potrograd, where the whole delegation was transported from Moscow in two long trains each consisting of 16 sleeping cars (if you think it wise to eliminate this you may) equipped with the latest fittings end snow-white sheets to lie upon, with a magnificent dining car, where delegates partook of their meals cooked in Russian style, and served with taste by courteous waiters.&quot;When the trains arrived at the Hikolaevsky Station the delegates were greeted with the International played by a military band which lednthe way to the Square confronting the station, and a further greeting from the President of the Petrograd Soviet on behalf of the workers of that city, after which we marched through the wonderful Nevsky Prospect (now the 25th of October St.) to tho tune of a Ev-sslan march, to take our temporary abode in the once famous bourgeois hotel, whose walls, could they but speak, would disclose the secrets of bourgeois debauches and high society night escapades.&quot;Pivc years after the 25th of October, 1917, when bourgeois papers hiss their blackest lies at the Russian Soviet Republic, accusing it of grossly betraying the workers, the representatives of the Workers&apos; psvrty -(Communist) of every country in the world, were acc Grume dated in this magnificent hotel recently renovated and refitted with the latest appliances for the comfort of the guests of the Cormmuiist International. .&quot;On Saturday, November ^th, the delegates marched to the burial ground of the heroes of the revolution, I    where, in the teeming rain,  700;000 people with bare heads I    listened to the solemn notes of the Do-5 March,    After ]    this Clara Ectkin pieced a beautiful wreath upon the graves I   of those pioneers of working class liberty.    The firing of the salute from the huge guns in the vicinity broke the stillness while the thoughts of every individual traversed back over the five years of struggle, carried on by the Russian workers against the attacks of imperialist armies j  with allied capitalistic backing, who endeavoured torecapture the power wrested from them during the day of the I Revolution.   From &quot;she graveside of these heroic 1 revolutionaries, we marched through torrents of rain andpools of mud, up to the square facing th9 Wintor palace, to I witness the march past of tho Red Araiy of Petro^rad.

Hoy/ ;ve yearned that Lloyd George end his military puppets with Arthur Henderson and his friends of the Second International Were allowed to have one glimpse of this magnificent working class military * machine, followed by hundreds and&apos; hundreds of thousands of working men and women, full of enthusiasm and: revolutionary vigour,&apos; shouting their praises to the pioneers and      * i protectors of working class emancipation of this great  ? country.&quot;&apos;&apos;   :&apos; &apos; &apos;-&apos;  &apos;;&apos;&apos; *,&quot;-Returning to Moscow after a two. days sojourn in    $ this. clty;&apos;o&apos;f historical imperialistic, bloody, record,&apos; we Were still met with-a greater surprise.

James 0TGrady did on the May-Day demonstration in 1922, as: reported- in. the Daily Herald, &quot;confounded by * $hp ferv&apos;our. and revplutidnary enthusiasm of the workers of      ; this&apos; vast country.   It appears&apos; to be more intensified, than ever, and in contra-distlnctlon to the fabulous reports of capitalist publicity organs, which deftdare th&amp;t the demonstrations are produced by communist, compulsion and threats, only need to witness at least the wonderful response&apos; of both sexes assembled to celebrate the occasion of their liberation from Caarist oppression and capitalist tyranny&apos;,&apos; to fling back such falsehood In. their teech with; -disgust.&apos;   Standing in readiness to follow the troops which were: fivp hours passing&apos; through the Red Squire, there, were approximately one million people, at II p&apos;clock in the   T morning, for oner mile and a half packed from side to side, of this wide street (Tvprekaya). where the factory, shop,&apos;., mill, railway, clerical and transport, workers&apos; of this ancient city, patiently waited to demonstrate before the : liiterii^tional Delegation tabioh had already. stopd.: gazing iii. wohaer and admiration for four hours at the product of Trotssky^s military organisational handiwork.   For four hours these working class enthusiasts of both sexes and of all ages stood patiently waiting their opportunity to march through the Red Square..   In, several&quot;&quot;places, to. keep themselves warm, they would suddenly take&apos; hold of the nearest comrade and six others would toss him or her high into the, air again and. again.

?policy was quickly reducing the revolutionary temperature of the Bus-aSaii messes-to     very Jeff degree tad stopping tt the vitals of the Soviet fcopufcHo&quot;&quot;     *te do not marvel at the wov%&amp; capitalists experimenting in stunts of this character, since they have in their possession information which terrorises them with visions of a similar rising in the countries which they now ruthlessly exploit.     I have witnessed one of the greatest proletarian demonstrations the world has ever known, and when one reflects for a moment upon the miniature form of demonstration as seen in England, where we have probably a greater number of organised workers than any country in the worlds we confess our May-D&amp;y demonstrations in Hyde Park, our Mo^More-WtiT demonstrations in other large working class centres, are merely toys in comparison with such enormous displays of working class solidarity,.    Foreign ambassadors that were privilegedto witness these demonstrations, were undoubtedly struck with fear and trembling, if not partial paralysis.     The dream of an occurrence analogous to this rolling mass of revolutionary enthusiasts, stimulated and inspired by the liberties enjoyed by their class,  and not by the terror of the Communist lash,  taking place in England, France, and America, must eventually make somnambx^iists out of the bourgeoisie of these countriesRevolution is not a ghastly spectre in the economic background to the worldxs proletariat, but the herald of a new society, where capitalist bonds and fetters have no power to bind the workers any longer.     But to the bourgeoisie it means dispossession, loss of power, and, finally, exteras&amp;nat ion.&quot;EES UlEMPIOYKDIt is difficult to form an accurate estimate of the numbers of unemployed marchers coming to or going from London and their own leaders are ignorant of the number actually in the Ivfctropolitan Area at present.   Mon are still deserting from London and some are joining and some are leaving the new contingents which are en route.     2ho available information is classified below as:(A) New arrivale in, and contingents marching to, London.(B) Marchers returning to their homes.Earlessown   -   Four members of the local Comrauniot Party left Earlestown on bicycles on December.6th.Tm Gatechead contingent, numbering 29 men and 1 boy, arrived in Leeds on Deoember 9th and left on December 11thfor/

Mayors offer of accommodation in the workhouse.The Govan contingent stayed in WIgton workhouse on December 10th:    they have separated from the Dundee, Bridge ton and Greonock contingents with whom they spent a night in Carlisle as they found that there were too many going in the same direction with the result that &quot;people are getting tired of it.    The extra distance we are travelling will be nothing when you consider how we can open new ground and get propaganda done.&quot;On December 6th. the Greenock unemployed arrived at Carlisle in a char-a-lancaster-, which had apparently come from Wishaw and which returned empty;    on the same day the Paisley contingent passed through Carlisle without staying the night.The greenock contingent numbered 50 on arrival at Manchester on December 11th.13 men left Alexandria on December 2nd and were Joined by a party from Ren ton15 men left Clydebank on December 5th in charge of Richard Beattie:    3*i had signed on for the journey, several of whom are believed to have joined in the march outside the borough/

During the -..eek-end about 150 of the unemployed in the wandsworth Workhouse came out in&apos; a body to protest against the bad. food:    they telephoned to Hannington threatening a forcible demonstration at (yueen^ Squsre if they were not provided with money for food: Hannington instructed that the collections taken at Clepham Common, which had been earmarked for other purposes, should be given to thenuAccording to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; George Lansbury stated at a meeting held in the :.;heern.ess Hippodrome on December 10 th:&quot;My/

Lot them mako themselves a nuisance to Boards of Guardians, town councillors, Members of Parliament, and the Government,nOn December 11th about 50 unemployed carrying sandwich boards appealing to the Prime Minister to grant them an interview paraded outside the House of Commons: they were led by Hannington and Dingley.On December 12th about 35 unemployed arrived at the House of Commons in twos and threes and were seen in the Central Hall by George Lansbury:    at what appeared to be a signal from Lansbury, they produced &quot;Out of Work&quot; placards bearing the words &quot;The Workless must not let us forget. (Mr. Clynos)&quot; and commenced to sing the &quot;Red Plag&quot;.     They were ejected by the police after considerable disturbance and forcible opposition.&quot;THE COMMIJHIST&quot;Officials at headquarters are giving a good deal of consideration to the proposal to start a daily communist paper early next year:   R. Palme Dutt is to be the editor, with T.A. Jackson, the present editor of the weekly &quot;Communist as chief assistant.     George Bell, of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has stated that that paper will cease publication in the Hew Year:   the communists will endeavour to obtain about 50,000 of the present readers of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, provided, as one of my correspondents states, &quot;they can get financial assistance from Russia&quot;.The Scottish organiser has reported the following sales of the &quot;Comraunist Daily&quot; issued during the last days of the General Blection:Alexandria/

So far, the money paid in amounts to  33.15.6. and the expenditure to  14.19.0.The current issuo of the weekly &quot;Communist&quot; is to include a special eight page supplement containing the speeches made by Lenin and Trotsky at the Moscow Congress on &quot;Five years of the Soviet Republic&quot; and &quot;Vistas of World Revolution&quot;.&quot;THE YOUHG COMMUNIST&quot;The December issue of this paper, in pursuance ofthe &quot;anti-militarist&quot; policy laid down by Moscow contains a lengthy article on &quot;Flogging in the Navy&quot;, which givesan account of an alleged incident in M-:rch 1917 and isprefaced with the statement;-&quot;Atrocities in the British NavyJ   Boys flogged into insensibility by the brutal bullies of the bosses1 Havy.     While the bosses1 sons are living on the fat of the land at 3ton, Harrow, Oxford and Cambridge, our lads of the working class are flogged by the lackies of the boss class.

The minds of the boys are poisoned by a patriotismthat/
that is corrupt and foul:    the citizenship that the hoys are taught is nothing more than obedience to the master class, and when the time comes will defend the right of the boss class to plunder the workers...&quot;Our fight is not with the rank and file of these organisations, but with the officers or leaders, who are but the tools of the tyrants who crush us.    The rank and file of all military organisations are composed of members of the working class.    It is the task of the Young Communist League to show the rank and file that its interests, and those of the working class as a whole, are identical. Capitalism cannot exist without militarism:   and tho only way to abolish militarism is to abolish Capitalism.    This can only be dono by revolutionary means a   The Communist solution to the military problem is found in the words of Shelley:    vPorge arms in your defence to bear&apos;.&quot;IRISH EVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IP GREAT BRITAINPcncr^sA mectinp of the Irish Self-determination League at/ B&amp;tlie was held on December 6th.

I asked you in Irish just now are you in favour of the Republic.    I asked you further if you are in earnest in your intention to maintain that Republic    I went to say one thing and that is that you must show that you are in earnest by your actions at the present time.     There is an organisation, the Irish Self-Deiemlnation League, which is Republican out and out *    If you are in earnest to maintain the Republic you must show it by joining that organisation. You must show your earnestness by malting your branches strong and by seeing that the activities of your branch are effective.&quot;0TBrian/
