]l (r:f192THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT]. CRET. q A B I NET. . Ofpy Nt..AGRICULTURAL   RATES. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.In the course of the election I was authorised by the Prime fiiniater to promise an enquiry, with all reasonable dispatch, into the subject of agricultural rating and the removal of any unfairness which may be found to exist.   There have been endless enquiries on this subject.    The present position is. that by the Agricultural Rates Act 1896, agricultural   land is assessed at half only of Its value.   An Exchequer grant was made of an amount sufficient to make good the deficiency so caused at that time, hut since that date, owing largely tii the new burdens thrown by legislation on looal authorities, rates have risen so muoh that the agriculturist is now paying more on his 50 per cent, assessment than in 1896 he did on the total assessment..A large scheme cf rating reform was prepared by a Committee of the late Cabinet, but it involves a very big bill, and I do not know if it is the intention of the Government to proceed with It at an early date.   Meanwhile, I shall be asked in the House of Commons this reek what is the Government policy on the subject.   What agriculturists sant is a grant from the Exchequer to make good a larger portion of their rates.    This could be done by altering the 50 per oent..,,reIief nder the 1896 Aot to one of a larger percentage to meet the preser-t Editions.If the 50/2 were raised to 62&apos;k% the eost to theExchequer would be If the 50% were raised to 5.6 2/srds^ the costto the Exohequer would balfour the 5C/o were raised to .75/  the cost to the Exchequer would be 1,364,-000 irai7,aoo.. , 2 ,.728,000I should be glad if the Cabinet will ^ive me some indication what I oan say on the subject this werek.stry of Agriculture and Fisheries $ 27th November 1022.
