Cabinet. ^ JLReport &apos;:.f the Committee on Unemployment.1.     Very large schemes for the mitigation and prevention of unemployment are already In operation.     We mayparticularly mention(a) the Trade fac11Itie3 Acts, under which authority was given to encourage new undertakings of a guarantee of interest and/or capital up to a maximum ..of  25,000,000. Guarantees to the amount cf  22,000,000 have already been given and It is believed that the ultimate cost to the State will be negligible.     We refer further to this scheme in our recommendation A.(b) the export credit; scheme; which enables the treasury to authorise the granting cf credit and the undertaking of insurance9 for the purpose of re-establishing overseastrade  to the extent cf  26,000,-000*power is still available to deal with further schemes am cant ing to 3 cr.ie  12 p 000,0 00(c) grants for arterial and main.road work for   which  5;300;000 are available for the current year and-certain further proposals are understood to be raider consideration. Large sums were expended In this way last year.*d) Grants for Works of public- utility,     Works up to a total Of  30,000,000 may be aided by grants from Lord St. David3 Committee in respect of last winter and the present winter.      Works up to a total value of  22,000,000 have been promised this assistance, so that the committee is  still in a position to assist another  8,000,000 worth of schemes.until comparatively recently grants could also be made by this committee towards the. amount spent in wages on works for which no loan was obtained, and certain works financed on this basis are still in progress.     These include a numberof/
of road works not eligible for assistance from the Ministry of Transport (see Recommendation C.(l)).(e) land Drainage and Improvement,     A sum of  300,000 Is being expended by the Minister of Agriculture (with a corresponding grant for Scotland) on assisting the undertaking of these works;      Over 1*000 men are at present so employed in England arid Wales.(f j Overseas Settlement.      It is as yet too early to estimate the probable effect of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, since schemes, to be settled with the several Dominions, are necessarily slow in the earlier stages of progress,      It is, however, understood that some 1,500 men have been accepted, for emigration to Australia.Large numbers were also settled overseas as part of the demobillsation programme *(g) Ttoeaployment^ Insurance.     A new &quot;period&quot; of unemployment insurance commenced on the 2nd instant, ant! benefit covenanted or uncovenanted will generally be payable for at least twelve weeks from that date,  and in the great majority of oases for a longer period,2a     We are glad to be able to report that the difficulties incidental to the &quot;grouping&quot; of the railway companies which have led to somo delay in the progress of electrification and similar schemes are being surmounted and that there Is good reason to hope that schemes involving the expenditure of at least  12* 000; 000 are likely to be commenced In the comparatively near future.3.      The first of our specific recommendations, cn which an early decision of the Cabinet la required are as fellows : -
(A) TRADE FACILITIES ACT, 1921.A proposal was submitted to our predecessor&apos;s that the Act of 1921 should be extended so as to enable the Treasury not only to guarantee the principal and Interest of loans under the scheme but also to make advances or grants of interest for a period not exceeding three years 9 pending the ability by the undertaking to defray Inter-eat charges out of its revenue.     It was explained to us by the Treasury representatives that the object sought by this proposal was In fact attainable under the existing powers of the scheme, since Interest being necessarily a charge on either revenue or capital, and revenue being In the presumed case deficient, the Treasury guarantee of capital covered also the capital loss Involved in the payment of Interest in. early years otherwise than out of revenue aIn these, circumstances we thought it unnecessary to recommend that the Act should be amended in this respect0As has been said this Act ceased to authorise new guarantees on the 9th instant0     Proposals for the revival and extension of the Act has been approved by the late Government0     Wo are very glad to report that Sir Robert Kind era ley and. the members of his Committee find themselves able, after all, to continue their valuable and exhausting work under the Act;    and this fact enables us to simplify to some extent the proposals formerly approved *     A suitable understanding has been arrived at on certain other points of difficulty and wo recommend
(i) that the Act of 1921 he revived for a period of 12 months-. (11) that the maximum amount of capital which - and the amount of interest on which - may be guaranteed under the Act he raised from  25,000,000 to  50,000,000.(iii) that provision be made to legalise the charging of fees on a percentage or other suitable basis to meet the heavy costs of legal end other expenses under the Bill,(iv) that the necessary Bill be prepared by the Treasury in consultation with the Board of Trad-; and the Department of overseas Trade and introduced at the earliest possible moment (see also recommenda11 on B).&quot;(B) EXPORT crejdi ts bohhhlh, There is a slight ambiguity In the terms of the Overseas Trade Acts 1920 and 1921 as regards the date upon which guarantees in connection with the Export Credits Scheme are to be regarded as having been given.      Legislation is necessary to remove this ambiguity and we recommend that a clause dealing with the matter be included in the Bill already mentioned.4, l&quot;Je further reogramerid that the pronouncement to be made on behalf of the Government next week should include an undertaking to extend to the extent of  10,000,000 if necessary the amount of the undertakings which may be assisted under the Exports Credit Scheme if the existing limits of that Scheme ( 26,000,000) should prove Insufficient.-     We understand that actual expenditure is not likely to be entailed by this extension.5.0 We come now to our recommendatioijs upon the specific reference as relating to the submission of alternative schemes, additional to and independent of the preceding proposals of the special Colonial Conference and the Improvement of the Trade Commissioners Service upon the basis of an expenditure of  1,000,000 and  5,000,000 respectively..
.;,     ;(C ) LORD ST ,  DAVIDS &apos;  C OMMJ. TTgg.(i) As has been said Lord st  Davids&apos; cokimlttee/s now pre-eluded from making new grants to works the cost of which isdefrayed out of revenue and not out of loan.understand thatstrong representations have been received in favour of reviving the earlier form of grant (for works charged to revenue) and that the amount of money provided in this financial year will be underspent to the extent of  100,000 *-  150 , 000 o      It must be recognised that a very much larger sum could readily be expended in this way if any general invitation to submit      schemes of the kind were issued by the &apos; Committee,     We_ reaomrend that the Committee should be authorised to revert to the system of making grants for relief works,, undertaken by Local Authorities without borrowing money,  on the basis of 60% !6f the amount expended in wsges,(ii)* Road works in rural areas.      The great bulk of the expenditure for the relief cf unemployment and of the advantage of the Trade Facilities and Export Credits Schemes enures to the urban workere Moreover the agricultural labourer - who I s no,;? faced in many places with an acute and prolonged degree of unemployment     is outside the unemployment insurance scheme.      Vie, therefore,, deem it necessary to supplement the provision made for him by the existing Land Drainage r-te, Scheme and the preceding recommendations by the following proposal, Wo recommend that a substantial proportion of the funds available to the Unemployed Grants Committee for the encouragement of works for which no loan is required be allocated to the encouragement of relief works in specifically agricultural areas, that the work to be undertaken should be in the nature of improvement of third class fc - Is to be carried out by Rural District Councils (in Scotland by i County Councils), that the wages paid on such works should in no case exceed the agricultural rate of wager, settled by a Conciliation I Committee or otherwise for the District, and that the Unemployment/Grants
Grants Committee should relax, as occasion night require,  the conditions that 75$ of the labour employed on those works must necessarily be ex-service men and that- labour must he engaged through the labour exchange.The additional expenditure resulting from the revival of this form of grant we estimate, at  -450 , 000 representing new   -works costing in all. 1,800,000 and providing 26 weeks of work for 18,000 men,.By special propaganda and the invitation of proposals from local authorities the expenditure under, this scheme may be increased.by a further  500,000 representing works costing in all  3,,000)000 and providing 26 weeks of work for 24,500 men, For the purpose of our larger scheme we recommend that an effort to secure this extension should be made.      On neither basis will it be necessary to provide any moneys in the current financial year,Do Land Drainage and Improvements     The sum of  300,000 (with a corresponding grant to Scotland) was provisionally: allocated to this service by the late Government,     The whole of this sum will be exhausted by the scheme a already before the Minister of Agriculture,    If the submission of further schemes is not to be stopped a further sum of  150,000, (-f a corresponding Scottish grant) will be required, of which  70,000 will be spent in the current financial year a      We recommendthat authority be given for this further expenditure.      Further we recommend   that the date by -which schemes of this kind are to be finally brought    to a close should - as last year -. be the 31st Hay, after which date agricultural work should bo in full awing.We further recommend that in Scotland the improvement of roads -
in private ownership used for the purposes of agriculture and sylviculture toe included as land improvement works in respect of which grants may toe given under this scheme. We understand that these additions to the grant will enable 20 weeks work to be provided for a further 6, COO men.E.     We further recommend assuming the larger scheme to toe adopted that an additional sum of  40,000 should be placed, at the disposal of the Minister of Agriculture, over and above the grant for Land Drainage, to enable him to deal with a drainage scheme.submitted by the Lea Conservancy,. in accordance with the Ministry1s Unemployment proposals.   This scheme was rejected by the Ministry as it Involved so large a sum and-was not in Its entirety a scheme of land drainage.   Moreover the unemployed to ba relieved are primarily those of West Ham viz. nor-agricultural and the rate of wages would be higher than the . agricultural wage.    The works are however important and havs an influence on public health In that they would relieve flooding in West Hsm0P.    Por-ssi-rj^   Last year a sun of  165,000 was expended by the Forestry Commission in special work for the relief of the u-oe.mpJ oyedo   The- work was partly carried out on the Grown lands and parti:/&quot; by owners to whom a grant of  3 per acre planted was paid.    (For clearing brushwood the grant paid  2 per acre)0   Over 4,500 men were found employment for an average period of 20 weeks. An exceptionally large amount of this expenditure is devoted to the payment of wages and it is estimated that for every  100 paid in grant to owners (including local authorities)  173 was actually paid out in wages0   ^e^reoonnnend that authority be given for an expenditure on this scheme of a sum not exceeding  100,000 in the current financial year0A one-clause Bill will be necessary as in the autumn of 1921 to enable the Commissioners to make grants to owners(private/
(private persons or looal authorities).   In view of the urgency of the matter we rocommend that the Bill should be passed in the present Session, but even in Its absence we understand that work oan be commenced on a considerable scale in the very near future.The total expenditure raoammended by us Is  100,000, of which  50,000 will require to bo Issued in the current financial year if legislation Is undertaken this session the necessary work for 2-000 men for an average of 20 - 25 weeks will it Is estimated be provided.    If legislation has to be deferred to next cession only  25,000 of the total expenditure will requiro to be issued before 1st April,- frfeiiu..!&apos;&apos;) .....0&quot;.-&quot; b aijtwl-......&amp;m!Zftt&amp;g^^G,3B^    The Office of Works has a considerable programme of deferred works of maintenance,and repair.    For the purposes of our larger scheme we recommend that they should be authorised to expend a sum of  375,000 on overtaking these arrears, of which  120,000 would require to be Issued In the current financial year.   20 weeks works would be provided for 5,500 men.   For the pur-poses of the smaller scheme we limit tho total expenditure to  250,000 of which  90,000 would require to be Issued In the current financial year, 20 weeks work would be provided for 2,400 men.H.    Post Office Cables.   We understand that the Post-Master General is able to put into very early operation schemes for the laying of nost office cable amounting to a total of  656,000 of which  150,000 in the current year and 110,500  (trench work only apart from cabling) men-months of work would be provided.    The Post-Master General would be prepared to defray the cost involved from the Post Office Revenues, subject to being allowed a contribution of say  20,000 to cover loss through acceleration end the/
the employment of unskilled, labour.   We would point out that in addition to relieving unemployment among both skilled and unskilled men, this work produces a substantial State asset and may be expected to command popular favour.The Minister of Transport is prepared If he is allowed to anticipate Road Fund revenue for two further years, and if the Treasury is prepared to make up to 50$ such contributions as can be secured from local authoritiess zo put in hand a  3ff000,000 program-Tie of arterial road development0    The amount of employment provided would of course be very large, but the work could not be put into immediate execution^   The cost to the State (as opposed to the Road Fund) would be in the neighbourhood of  1;500;0000   We include this proposal in our larger scheme afki    Jdvonile I h employment Oentrea.   In the hope of averting or at least checking the demoralisation that threatens the unemployed adolescent we recommend that a sum of  50-000 (of which  -40-;000 will be required In the current financial year) be placed at the disposal of the Minister of Labour for the establishment of Juvordle Unemployment Centres on the lines of those established immediately after the WarR   In these centres physical and vocational training is given, and adolescents drawing unemploymont benefit in the area are required to attend We understand that for the sum proposed training can be given to some 50 9 000 ado lea cents- - or approximately 2!5% of the present number of adolescent unemployed0 -SB i&quot;* Housing. Lord st  LavidTa Committee has hitherto been unable to assist Housing Schemes,   Now that the State Scheme has coma to an end there -seems to be no- reason why housing should not receive grants from the Committee in the same way as other re\Tenue-&quot;producing schemes of Local Authorities,We/
we recommend that the present rule should he withdrawn.    it is estimated that possibly 3,000 houses may be built in this way involving 42,000 men-months employment.   there is of course the risk that any form of assistance to housing may tend to prevent the reduction of wages which otherwise would appear to be probable on 1st april next.   with this in view we recommend that only houses commenced before 1st april should be aided in this way.   we do not however think that with this limitation the risk is a.serious one.    no additional financial provision is required as the limits prescribed for the committee1 a operation of capital schemes appears unlikely to be reached^ I/. ( &quot;iies^g;) loans to guardians.    Finally we recommend the inclusion in the larger scheme&quot; of a sum of  600,;000 earmarked for the purpose of making Isans, on the same lines as are at present observed, to boards of guardians (in scotland parish councils) and other Local authorities in respect of current expenditure which cannot be financed from oywc:^ rates or by other lenders,These sums are additional to the sum of  800,00 which will require to be voted in this financial year to meet additional expenditure which is expected to be incurred, before the end of the year on services covered by the existing Relief of unemployment vote.   the Ministry of health have already requested authority for the submission of a supplementary Estimate for  600,000 for inclusion in the next estimates to be presented to Parliament,Although in accordance with the request mal5e&quot;&apos;to va wo ere now submitting alternative programmes on the basis suggested to us.  we desire to state that it is our considered op..n:&apos;.en that the smaller programme (for an expenditure of  1,000,000) will be effected neither in the relief of distress, nor as an answer to the critics of the government,   we are bound to admit that a very large immediate expenditure and theprovision/
provision of immediate employment&apos; on a very largo scale are not within the scope of practical politics at the present time. We feel however that the larger programme which we submit may effectively   demonstrate the desire of tho Government to relievo the situation, and by &quot;creating a suitable atmosphere,, may, small though the proposals really are;, relieve the tension arising from tho continuance of unemployment on a large scale. 6.
