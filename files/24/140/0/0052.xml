(Printed for the Cabinet.December 1922.)SECRET.CP. 4852.-3CABINET.I circulate to my colleagues a letter I have received from, the War Office regarding the proposed, changes in the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure.The Army Council understand that the Cabinet Committee, which was recently considering the proposals of the Government of India for changes in the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, has been dissolved without reporting on the application of any such change to the personnel of the British Army in India. This is a matter in which the Council have a great, indeed a predominant, interest, and I am accordingly commanded to lay the following observations before you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, who, it is understood, now has the whole question of the Indian Governments proposals under his consideration.The Council find that very important changes are contemplated. Under section 41 of the Army Act persons subject to military law may be tried by court martial for any civil offence, subject to the proviso that no such person shall be tried by court martial for treason, murder, manslaughter, treason-felouy, or rape in the United Kingdom, or in any place other than. Gibraltar outside the United Kingdom but within His Majesty \s Dominions, &quot; unless such, person at the time he committed the offence was on active service, or such place is more than one hundred miles as measured in a straight line from any city or town in which the offender can be tried for such offence by a competent civil court.&quot; This arrangement lias resulted in numerous cases being tried by court martial on account of the locality of the alleged offence being more than 100 miles from the Court; and even apart from that consideration, the High Court trials have been conducted by Europeans, and in an atmosphere no doubt free from any suggestion of racial feeling.The position would be entirely changed by the grant, under the proposed Code, to Sessions Courts of full jurisdiction in all criminal cases.&apos; The result would only be in out-lying frontier districts that persons subject to military law charged with one of these five major offences, will be triable by court martial, and normally he will be triable by a Sessions Court, frequently presided, over by a native judge. Moreover, the preliminary investigation of the charge will be conducted by a magistrate, usually a native, who will decide whether the accused is to be committed for trial or not.It. may be urged that the obligation to try these five major offences by civil courts, in the circumstances specified, is statutory and that consequently no dispensing authority exists. This produces a very curious situation, since under section 549 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a section which it is proposed to retain in the new Code, the Governor-General in Council is empowered to make rules as to cases in which persons subject to military law shall be tried by a Court under the Code or by a court martial. The Governor-General lias made such, rules, and under these rules the Commanding Officer of the accused has the power, except in the case of the five major offences barred by section 4.1. of the Army Act, to remove the latter from the jurisdiction of the civil court, whenever he sees fit, in order to bring him before a court martial. The result of these rules will be that in future a man charged with a minor offence may be removed from, the jurisdiction of a magistrate or Sessions Court, but. a man charged with one of the five major offences cannot be so removed and will be triable by a Sessions Judge and not solely by a High Court Judge as at present.Cases oi: treason and treason-felony are likely to be very rare, and consequently it is the effect of the new Code in tho case of charges of murder, manslaughter andPEEL.December 1922.Con lideiitial.105/Gen. No./3020 (A.G. 8).Sir,War Office, 24th November 1922.100   12.-22
rape which require most attention. These charges will in most instances bear a racial character and they will be brouglit most frequently during periods of. civil disturbance, that is at times when racial feeling is most, high and when there is a possibility of native judges being biassed against European troops, owing to the action which the latter may have been called upon to take. In these circumstances it seems to the Council that it. would be in every way preferable that such charges, if the offence had been committed without the radius in which they must necessarily be referred to the High Court, should be dealt with by courts martial, where the atmosphere is likely to be more tranquil than in a Sessions Court not far removed from the locality of the offence. They consider that in many cases there might be a very strong feeling among the troops that a fair trial was not,to be obtained diom ..a native Sessions Judge, even with the safeguards in respect to the colour of the jury in racial cases which is provided by the Code. Should such a feeling arise, the Council feel that it would be most prejudicial to the discijDline of the troops and might produce very serious consequences.The Council would consequently urge that the proposals of the Government of India should be amended so as to remove from the jurisdiction of Sessions Courts the offences of treason, murder, manslaughter, treason-felony and rape where the person charged is subject to military law.With regard to the minor offences which can be removed to the jurisdiction of a court martial under section 549 of the Code, the Council apprehend that the position Of the British troops in India is sufficiently safeguarded so long as the section in question and the present rules made thereunder are in force. , They gather, however, that it is open to the Indian Legislature to amend section 549, and also open to the Governor-General in Council to amend the rules which he has made thereunder. Were such an amendment to take the form, under pressure of native public opinion, of abolishing or restricting the power at present enjoyed by the military authorities of withdrawing cases to the jurisdiction of courts martial, the resultant situation would in the councils opinion be a serious one, and they will be glad iherefore both to learn whether the Secretary of State for India considers the risk of such a change to be practically serious, and in any case to be assured thai no proposals to make such a change shall be countenanced without reference being made to them at an early stage in the discussion.It is understood that the Government of India has been instructed to take no further action in the direction of carrying oat their proposals pending consideration by &quot;His Majesty;s Government.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State (Sd.) &apos;     1:1. j. Cueedy.for India.
