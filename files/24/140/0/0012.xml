No.&quot; rank of officers in the Navy, Army and Air Force, with a memorandum, CP. 4293,     7044 dated  6th October, in which he submits that the recommendations made in the draft report, although not accepted by the War Office and Air Ministry representatives on the Committee, should be approved.The difference of opinion has arisen on the question of the precedence to be accorded to Naval Captains, Commanders and Lieutenants.The present table of precedence of these ranks is : -Navy.	Army.	Air Force.Captain of 3 years&apos; seniority; Captain under 3 years&apos; seniority. Commander, but junior of the Army rank. Lieute nan t-Commandet&apos;. Lieutenant.	Colonel. 1       Lieutenant-Colonel. Major. Captain.	Group Captain. Wing Commander. Squadron Leader. Flight Lieutenant.The Chancellor and the Naval Member of the Committee recommend that the table of precedence as regards these ranks should be : 		Navy.	Army.	Air Force.Captain. Commander. Lieutenant-Commander. Lieutenant.	Colonel. Lieutenant-Colonel. Major. Captain.	Group Captain. Wing Commander. Squadron Leader. Flight Lieutenant.The Military and Air Force representatives on the Committee did not agree to any alteration of the present rules as affecting Naval Captains and Commanders ; but, if any change were to be made, they thought that, in view of the early age at which a Naval Officer usually attains the rank of Lieutenant, the Junior Officers of that rank, say, those with less than four years&apos; service as such, should rank one step lower than at present, i.e., with Lieutenants of the Army and Flying or Observer Officers of the Air Force.The Chancellors proposals have the merit of greater simplicity, and are also recommended on the ground that the present rule as regards Naval Captains and Commanders leads to difficulties when British Naval Officers meet foreign Naval and Military Officers ; but the Army Council cannot agree that these considerations afford(b22/294)   100   11/22   w.o.p.   514SECRET.
any justification for lowering the status of British Army Officers.   They urge that the responsibility of a Lieutenant-Colonel commanding a regiment of cavalry or a battalion of infantry is surely greater than that of a Commander in the Navy, and they see no reason for altering the table of precedence of those ranks, which has stood the test of time and experience, and has not given rise to any insurmountable difficulties.There is, further, an important financial consideration. It is true that the terms of reference to the Committee preclude any effect ,on pay, but in fact they offer no reliable safeguard on that point. At no very distant date, the simple fact would have to be faced that the junior Captain in the Navy is senior to the senior Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army ; and so on. Moreover, while the reference precludes any reopening of the scale of pay in consequence of the alteration of relative rank, it does not (even in terms) preclude the taking into consideration of relative rank in a general resettlement of pay arising independently, such as is now in prospect.The present table of relative rank, age and service being taken into account, is by no^ means disadvantageous to Naval Officers, and the Army Council can see no reason the raising their status.   They recommend that the present rules should be maintained.D.20th November, 1922.
