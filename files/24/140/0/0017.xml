i THIS DOCUMgljT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT ANNJVO MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.]SECRET. copy No.      C.P. 4317. CABINET,AGRICULTURAL,DEVELOPMENT IN ENGLAND AND WALES. Memorandum by the.. Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I circulate herewith a memorandum relating to the fund of  850,000 which was provided under Section 3 of the Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act 1921 for agricultural development in England and t4&apos;alea.R. A. S.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries 22nd November, 1922.
Negotiations concerning the Expenditure of the Special Fund provided for Agricultural Development.As part of the bargain made with the farmers when the corn guarantees were repealed in 1921, the sum of  850,000 was granted, by the Act repealing the guarantees, for agricultural development in England and Wales.   That sum was paid over to the Development Fund last March.On the 29th September 1921, a month-after the Act was passed, the Ministry of Agriculture wrote to the Treasury raising two questions of importance.    In the first place, the letter pointed out that it was clearly the intention of Parliament that the new fund should be in addition to &quot;normal&quot; expenditure for.such purposes as agricultural education and research, and the question therefore arose what should be taken as the &quot;normal&quot; expenditureo    Secondly, there was the question how long the new fund must be made to last.    Shortly after this letter to the Treasury was written, the Geddes Committee was appointed: and no doubt as a consequence of that appointment the Treasury did not reply for three months.    Oil the 21st December 1921, however.-, the Treasury answered to the effect that the figure of  400,000 per annum (practically the amount then being expended by the Ministry for purposes falling within the scope of the new fund) might be taken as the amount of the Ministry&apos;s &quot;normal&quot; expenditure, and that the new fund might be spent in a period of five years from the 1st April 1922.A month after this letter was received the Geddes Committee reported.   They recommended that the expenditure of the Ministry on education and research should be cut down to  250,000 per annum, and that on live stock improvement to  10,000 per annum.   The practical effect of this recommendation would have been to reduce the Ministry&apos;s existing expenditure from the basic figure of  400,000 per annum,      accepted by the Treasury a month before, to  260,000.   The reduction of
 14$,000 per annum thus-effected could only he made good out of the new fund,- which would therefore have been largely or entirely expended not in new work but simply in keeping alive what was already in existence.   The Geddes Committee further proposed, in direct contradiction of the Treasury letter of December 1921, that any expenditure Involving future commitments should be endowed for ever out of the fund.Sir Arthur Boscawen strongly objected to these proposals on the main ground that they were clearly contrary to pledges given at the time when the repeal of the corn guarantees was negotiated.   The Government adopted this view, and oh the 1st March 1922 Sir Robert Horne, then Chancellor of the Exchequer,&apos; made   a public statement in the House of Commons to that effect.     One sentence from his speech may be quoted -Mle were under pledge by the Corn Production (Repeal) Act not merely to give that grant to the agricultural industry of this country, but to give it in addition to what was already applied for the purposes of education and research.&quot;After this decision of the Government the Ministry of Agriculture put in hand the execution of a programme of expenditure drawn up on the authorised basis, namely, that the new fund could be spent over a period of five years on entirely new schemes, or extensions of existing schemes.    No question was raised during the summer: and the Ministry has of course made numerous arrangements with Universities, Colleges, Local Authorities, etc$, all through the country, upon this five years1 oasis. .   Towards the end of the summer, however, the Cabinet Committed on National Expenditure asked for the Ministry^ views on certain suggestions of the Treasury. These suggestions substantially raised again all the questions which the Ministry had thought were settled by the Treasury letter 0f December 1921, and the Cabinet decision of February 1922 upon
the report of the Geddes Committee.   The Ministry stood firmly &quot;by the arrangement approved in December 1921, partly on the merits of the questions involved   and partly on the ground that that arrangement could not now be altered without abandoning schemes to which the Government are morally committed.   The Committee in substance accepted the Ministry&apos;s contention on one point: but they coupled this acceptance with a recommendation which rendered it practically useless.   They reviued a proposal which was definitely rejected by the Treasury at the end of 1921 and again by the Cabinet in February 1922, that if the Ministry of Agriculture desires to set up a service which will not have terminated by March 1927 (the end of the five years period), the Ministry should set apart from the sum of  850,000 a sufficient endowment to provide for it.   The arguments against this proposal are set out in Sir Arthur Boscawen&apos;s Memorandum of the 17th October last.I ask that the Cabinet will definitely authorise me to proceed on the arrangement which was accepted by the Treasury less than a year ago, was confirmed by the Cabinet (after considering the report of the Geddes Committee) some nine months agoj and, v/ith. Treasury knowledge and acquiescence, has formed the basis of many engagements and negotiations during the last nine months between the Ministry and Universities, Agricultural Colleges, and similar bodies - engagements and negotiations from which the Ministry could not now recede without causing the greatest disappointment and incurring justifiable accusations of breach of faith.R.
