[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1922.SECRET.CP. 4320.CABINET.Proposed Legislation in India to amend the Criminal Procedure affectingthe Trial of Europeans.I have to invite the attention of my colleagues to a matter of great importance, involving considerable changes in the law of criminal procedure, and incidentally affecting the privileges of the European population of India in the matter of criminal trials.The Government of India wish to legislate, during the next session of their legislature (January to March 1923), with a view to minimising the distinctions which at present exist in the Indian law relating to the procedure applicable to the trial of Europeans and Indians, respectively, on criminal charges. The basis of the proposed legislation is the report (not yet published) of a Committee set up in December last, the recommendations contained in which the Government of India have so far proposed to accept without modification.2. Stated as briefly as possible, the history of the matter is as follows. The Indian law of procedure in criminal matters has from the earliest times, and for reasons which are closely connected with the history of the foundation and develop-ment of British supremacy in India, drawn a clear distinction between European British subjects and Indians, and has accorded to, the former a number of special privileges. An attempt was made by Lord Ripon&apos;s Government in 1883 to remove these distinctions, but the proposals which were embodied in the famous &quot; Ilbert Bill *&apos; of that vear aroused so much opposition on the part of Europeans that the Bill had to be drastically revised. The existing law is the*result of the compromise then arrived at a compromise which has never been acceptable to Indian opinion. The complaint which has been persistently pressed and which is repeated with increasing vehemence as the result of nearly every trial in which an European is accused of an offence is twofold; firstly, that racial distinctions, if ever defensible, are entirely indefensible in a matter of this kind, and, secondly, that the result of the existing law is that an European accused of a criminal offence is seldom treated in the manner that justice demands.On the 30th May, 1921, the Viceroy (very shortly after his arrival in India), in the course of a public speech, alluded to the question of racial equality in general terms, and stated his belief that there Avere &quot; certain questions .... in which there will be an opportunity for putting this equality on a firmer basis than at present exists.&quot; In a later speech (the 3rd September, 1921), with which he opened the first Session of the Indian Legislature to be held since his arrival, he was more specific, and said that his attention had been drawn to the differences in the legal procedure applicable to Europeans and Indians, that an opportunity would be taken in the course of that Session to lay before the legislature the proposals for his Government as to the steps to be taken for further examination of the question, and that he trusted that measures would be found to satisfy public opinion that justice will be done to both Europeans and Indians.It was to be expected that the creation of the new Councils would be seized without delay as the opportunity of pressing this matter to an issue, and in September 1921 a resolution was moved and carried without a division in the Legislative Assembly in the following terms : &quot; That in order to remove all racial distinctions between Indians and Europeans in the matter of their trial and punishment for offences, a Committee be appointed to consider what amendments should be made in those provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, which differentiate between Indians and European British subjects, Americans and Europeans who are not British subjects, in criminal trials and proceedings, and to report on the best methods of giving effect to their proposals.&quot;3. Anticipating that a motion in the Assembly in some such terms was inevitable, the Government of India had consulted all provincial governments on the5893   100   11/22   [9118]
question in the previous July (1921), and had asked for their views in time to enable them to deal with the debate. The first official intimation which the India Office received of the discussion was the receipt of a copy of this circular letter in August 1921. In view of the extremely difficult and controversial character of the issues involved, my predecessor, on receipt of this circular, telegraphed on the 1st September to the Government of India asking to be furnished with their views as soon as possible after they had received the local Governments&apos; opinions.4. Meanwhile, in replying to the debate of September 1921, the Home Member official of the Government of India, speaking oh behalf of the Government, stated that the sept0]s, 1921, Government of India had accepted the principle that it was &quot; desirable that there p. 377. &apos; &apos; should be equality of status in this country in the matter of criminal trials,&quot; and undertook to appoint a Committee to make recommendations to that end an under-taking which was fulfilled by the official announcement issued in December last appointing the Committee, in which the declaration was repeated that &quot;the Governor-General in Council has already accepted the principle that it is desirable that there should be equality of status for all people in this country, in the matter of criminal trials and proceedings.&quot; The Committee, which consisted of sixteen members, of whom seven were Europeans, was partly official and partly non-official in composition. It sat in Delhi in January last to take evidence, and later in Calcutta to confer with representatives of the European community. Their report was agreed upon in June, but, as already stated, has not yet been published.5. It is difficult to set out succinctly either the main provisions of the existing law or the recommendations of the Committee for its modification. In both cases details of considerable intricacy are the essence of the matter, and general statements are apt to be misleading unless qualified in detail.fhave prepared an exhaustive and detailed statement of this character, which I am circulating separately.The general effect of the Committee&apos;s proposals is (a) to &quot; level down &quot; in certain respects the existing rights of European British subjects and to restrict the classes of persons covered at present by that expression;(&amp;) to &quot; level up &quot; in certain respects the existing rights of Indians;(c) to provide a special procedure, not as at present for a special class of persons, but for a special class of cases, viz., those in which &quot; racial considera-tions &apos;&apos; are held to be involved. How precisely this class of case is to be defined the Committee have not recommended, beyond stating that the definition shall require all cases in which one party is an Indian and the other a European to be so treated.The main methods by which these processes are to be achieved may be summarised as follows : (i.) Under the existing law practically no serious criminal charge against a European British subject,* as defined in the Code, and no case whatever against a European involving the possibility of a death sentence, can be tried by any Court other than the High Courts of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Allahabad and Lahore, and the Chief Court of Lower Burma.Under the law as proposed to be amended a large number of Courts (known as Sessions Courts) which are inferior to High Courts, and of which there is one in each District of a Province, will have the same jurisdiction over both Europeans and Indians in all cases ordinarily triable by them.(ii.) Under the existing law no magistrate (other than a District Magis-trate or a Presidency Magistrate) has jurisdiction to try Europeans unless he has first-class powers and is himself a European.Under the proposals any first-class magistrate, whether he is an Indian or a European, will have jurisdiction to try Europeans.(iii.) Not only are the number of offences triable by Courts inferior to a High Court outside the Presidency Towns more limited if the accused is a European than if he is an Indian, but the degree of punishment which can be inflicted by any such Court is now much more limited if the convicted person is a European than if he is an Indian.It is proposed that the same powers of punishment shall be exercisable whether the convicted person is an Indian or a European.* The word &quot; European&quot; is used in this sense throughout this paragraph unless otherwise stated.
(iv.) While an Indian can be tried by jury in a Sessions Court only for a limited number of offences, a European can claim trial by a jury of which not less than half are Europeans for any offence; and this right is exercisable by a European even in a District Magistrate^ Court.It is now proposed that in both classes of Courts both Europeans and Indians shall be subject to the law at present applicable to the latter in the matter of the right to trial by jury, except in cases where &quot; racial considera-tions &quot; are involved. Eor these cases the right of both races to be tried by.a jury containing a majority of their own countrymen is to be affirmed.(v.) Under the existing law no appeal lies against a conviction in a trial by jury, except on a matter of law. The Government can, however, appeal against an acquittal on all or any of the charges framed by any Court except a High Court, both on facts and law, unless the trial was by jury, in which case an appeal against acquittal lies on a point of law only.It is now proposed to allow appeals against both convictions and acquittals and on both facts and lav/ in all cases other than those tried by jury. And even in jury cases it is proposed to allow appeals against convic-tion and acquittal on matters of fact as well as law if the jury was not unanimous, or if, being unanimous, the judge did not agree with them.It will be observed&apos; that this proposal, in its application to jury cases, practically abolishes the principle of the finality of a jury&apos;s verdict. The Committee observe as follows :  &quot; We recognise that this is an important alteration in the general law of the land, but we believe that it will receive considerable support from legal opinion in India. It has been pointed out to us that the English Act of 1907 does not recognise appeals against acquittals. But appeals against acquittals by the Local Government form an integral part of the Indian law and it would not be logical to extend appeals on facts to certain jury cases only in respect of convictions and not in respect of acquittals, especially as the chief complaint made against most juries is that they are too prone to acquit.&quot;(vi.) Under the existing law a European British subject for these purposes is defined as including persons born or domiciled in the Dominions and Colonies.It is proposed to confine the term to persons born or domiciled in the United Kingdom including Ireland, and to place &quot;colonials&quot; (other than those who are members of the British or Indian armies) on precisely the same footing as Indians.The &quot; colonials &quot; in India are believed to be few in number.(vii.) Under the existing law Europeans who are not British subjects, and Americans, though they have no special privileges as regards jurisdiction and powers of Courts, can. when triable by jury, claim a jury containing not less than one-half of Europeans or Americans.It is proposed to abolish this privilege, but I have ascertained from the Foreign Office that treaty obligations with certain States would make it necessary, if this proposal were adopted, to make an exception in favour of the nationals of those States. Such discrimination would clearly be impossible, and it is evident therefore that this proposal must be dropped.6. With the items in this summary numbered (vi) and (vii) the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office are respectively concerned. The War Office and the Air Ministry are concerned with the proposals as a whole, partly because so large a number of the persons potentially affected are men serving in the Forces, partly because the pro-posals in their effect upon the Army might conceivably affect security, and partly because the proposals affect that provision (S. 41) in the Army Act which gives a right of trial by Court-Martial to soldiers accused of certain offences which would ordinarily be triable by the Civil Courts, if there is no Civil Court competent to try them within a distance of 100 miles. Under these proposals there will be a &quot;competent court &quot; in every district of British India.7. The Viceroy personally and his Government press most strongly for permission to legislate in September on the grounds set out in the telegrams extracts from which are attached herewith.8. I have excluded from these telegrams passages relating to the proposal to legislate last September, as now being out of date. I have so far refused permission to publish the Beport or to introduce (or make known the terms of) any Government Bill based upon it until His MajestyV Government have been able to study the[9118] b 2
Apapers and define their attitude. The matter was brought before a Committee of the late Cabinet, but the case was then not quite complete. I have now received most of the local Governments&apos; opinions on the Committee&apos;s proposals, and I hope to receive very shortly the remainder and the Government of India&apos;s final proposals in the light of them. I also hope to receive shortly the official views of the War Office on the scheme as affecting the British army in India. These documents (or summaries of them) I will make available to my colleagues as soon as possible.PEEL.November 23, 1922.ENCLOSURES. I.Extracts from Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated July 7, 1922.Reference to Home Department letter No. 104, of 8th June : Racial Distinctions Committee.1. Copies of final report were forwarded with Home Department letter No. 43 of 22nd June, and printed copies were forwarded by mail of 29th June. Not necessary, therefore, to summarise proposals in final report. We note, however, that proposals in draft report were sufficiently modified as to enable Government Members to sign without general saving clause, and where report recommends immediate action, subject only to opinions of Local Governments regarding proposed extensions of rights of appeal in magistrates and jury cases. The subject bristles with difficulties, and we are of opinion that it is a matter for congratulation that, in a question where interests of two communities involved were so conflicting, Committee were able to reach conclusions so closely approximating to unanimity.3. Reference to proposals (a) to reduce the offences for which sentences of whipping may be imposed, and to provide that law in this respect shall apply to Europeans and Indians alike, and (b) to repeal Sections 30 and 34 of Code, Committee do not recommend immediate action, but enquiry. We are making separate references to Local Governments on these proposals and proposal in Mr. Carey&apos;s minute, that accused persons should have right to give evidence on oath. Meantime, we propose to retain law in these respects unaltered.4. As regards remaining proposals, we are making general confidential reference to the Local Governments and High Courts, in order to secure their opinions in time for early legislation. We are inviting their opinions particularly upon proposals to increase right of appeal in magistrates and jury cases, as they increase judicial work.As regards these proposals, we note following points for your information : (a.) Definition of European British Subject. Committee finally propose inclusion of persons specified in that Clause who are actually serving in India in His Majesty&apos;s British Army, Navy or Air Forces. As regards His Majesty&apos;s Indian Army, Royal Indian Marine or Indian Air Force, they only propose addition of such persons who were so serving at date of the adoption of the proposal. We note that the present definition contains serious anomalies; for example : European British subject domiciled in colony of the Cape of Good Hope is included, but not such a subject domiciled in East Africa. We consider it would clearly be impossible now to ask for any extension of the categories to which the proposed remaining privileges will extend. We recognise that the proposal will raise the Imperial question, but we do not think that it is of any great practical importance. No &quot;colonials,&quot; to use compendious term, resident in India, have come forward to indicate that they have any&apos;apprehensions on the subject. They are largely, we think, resident in the Presidency towns, where the procedure will be unaffected by the proposals. As I regards Colonial Members of the Indian Forces, it will be seen that those already in the Forces will continue to be entitled to the existing privileges, and we understand j that Indian opinion on the Committee was against providing careers in the Indian Forces for Colonials in the future. In these circumstances, we propose, for the present, to accept the proposals of the Committee.(b.) Jury Trials. The ultimate compromise proposed by the Committee was the extension for Indians of jury trials in all cases in which racial considerations are involved, and the reduction of jury trials for Europeans in cases in which racial
considerations are not involved. That is, in the latter cases Europeans will be tried by mixed juries or with the aid of assessors, according to the requirements for the district and for the class of offence concerned. Indians are triable by jury or with the aid of assessors. For both Indians and Europeans in cases tried with assessors,, it is proposed, if accused so claims, all assessors shall be of nationality of accused, and number of assessors shall be a minimum of 3 and, if possible, 4. As regards this compromise, we note that, so far as Europeans are concerned, the number of cases between Europeans is small, and we consider that the judge in the original trial, and the court of appeal, will necessarily attach great weight to the opinion of the assessors. We are of opinion that the compromise is suitable, and we propose to accept it.(c.) Summons Cases outside Presidency Towns. This is the main point in minute of dissent of Mr. Carey, who suggests that in such cases where racial considerations are involved, and punishment may embrace imprisonment or fine of over 50 rupees, same procedure should be adopted as in warrant cases. The objections in the minute to this proposal are not unreasonably expressed, but we are not greatly impressed by it. We do not consider European Community can raise any great objection to proposal, and we propose to accept it.(d.) Privileges of Europeans who are not British Subjects and Americans.  The Committee finally propose to repeal Sections 460 and 461 of the Code. These privileges are already very limited, as such persons are tried by jury or with aid of assessors, according to the law applicable to the district and the class of offence con-cerned, and accused persons are only able to claim, if practicable, not less than half the number of jurors or assessors shall be Europeans or Americans. We note that such persons had an absolute right to jury trial under Section 234 of Code of 1872,. and the jury had to consist of at least one-half Europeans or Americans, if such a jury could be obtained. This right was reduced to the present restricted right by Section 460 of the Code of 1882. We are of opinion that it may be claimed that, whereas formerly such persons might perhaps have been apprehensive as to justice which they would receive from judges and magistrates in Indian Courts, there is now less reason for such apprehensions, as Indian judges and magistrates have established their reputation. The provision cannot be retained, owing to the impossibility of justifying differentiation between these persons and nationals of other countries We suggest you should invite the attention of the Foreign Office to the proposal, but we propose provisionally to accept it.5. We desire to impress upon you the importance which we attach to the desirability of proceeding with the necessary legislation to give effect to the proposals wdth the utmost expedition. The Ilbert compromise of 1884 was always subject to opposition by Indians, and now that practically unanimous proposals have been made by a strong committee representing all classes, we think it of utmost importance to endeavour to enact the proposals forthwith.6. The following proposals of the Committee require your specific approval in Council before they can be carried into effect under Section 65 (3) of the Government of India Act: (a) The change in the definition of European British subjects in so far as it affects subjects of His Majesty born in countries in Europe other than the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the children of such subjects.(6) The extension of the definition of the High Court so as to include, with reference to proceedings against such European British subjects as are specified in Section 65 (3), the Courts of the Judicial Commissioners of the Central Provinces, Oudh, Sind and Upper Burma.(c) The proposal to empower judges in Sessions Courts to pass sentences of death on European British subjects.7. Mr. Carey&apos;s minute assumes there will still be special enquiry regarding extension of jury trials. We think it unnecessary now to come to any conclusion on this point.[9118]
Extract from Telegram from. Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated July 25, 1922.Your telegram No. 2778, dated 19th July : Racial Distinctions Committee.1. Confidential reference to Local Governments has issued, and we hope to receive their replies in time to enable Bill, to give effect to our provisional conclusions, to be introduced in Indian Legislature at an early sitting in September, and carried through the necessary stages in that month.2. In your telegram you refer to the expense involved by the proposals. This will in fact be confined to that involved by (a) The increase in numbers of appeals from Magistrates and in Jury cases.(b) The somewhat greater elaboration which will be required in summaryproceedings, because appeals will be admissible where they are not allowed at present, vide Section 264 of Code, and(c) The extra cost of the proceedings in cases in which racial considerations are involved.We do not wish to minimise this point, but we believe that the increase in expenditure will not be great. Under the head (a) the additional appeals which will affect first-glass Magistrates only will probably not be great or involve much labour. As regards Jury cases, the present proposals of the Committee only involve a very slight increase in the number of cases tried by Jury. It is true, however, that, so far as High Courts having original criminal jurisdiction are concerned, there will be an appreciable increase in the number of appeals. But this concerns only four Local Governments, Madras, Bombay, Bengal and Burma, and the increase in cost of allowing appeals on questions of fact in Jury trials must be accepted, at least, for racial cases, as accusations of failures of justice owing to acquittals of Europeans by Jury are gravamen of charge against present system. Under the head (b), the increase in judicial labour will be so small as almost certainly to involve but little increase in expenditure. Under the head (c) also, we anticipate that the number of cases in which racial considerations will be held to arise will be so small as to mean that the increase of expenditure under this head also will be inappreciable. We have particularly directed the attention of the Local Governments to the question of increased expenditure, and we have also directed the examination of statistics for selected areas, so as to indicate the number of cases in which racial considerations are likely to be held to be involved. We expect, therefore, to be able to give you by telegraph more accurate information as to whether probable increase of cost is likely to be appreciable or not, when the replies from Local Governments are received.3. We have stated already that we attach the utmost importance to the passing of the required legislation in September, and we believe that the best European and Indian opinion desire to see the question settled at the earliest opportunity. So far .as Parliament is concerned, we think it should be conclusive that the European Com-munity in India, represented in this respect by the European Association, is favourable to the acceptance of the recommendations, and anxious that this opportunity for settlement should not be lost.4. In conclusion, we note that it has not been an easy matter to reach practically unanimous conclusions upon this difficult question, and any delay now will, as we have indicated, seriously endanger the prospect of settling once for all this difficult question. It must be remembered that notices of motions for introduction of Bills to deal with the question have been received from non-official Members. If there is any -delay in the introduction of Government proposals, it will be impossible for us to prevent the Legislature from proceeding with non-official Bills to remove racial distinctions from Code of Criminal Procedure, and such Bills will certainly not be so favourable to the European community as the recommendations of the Committee.We recognise your Lordship must have time for consideration of the question, and we have therefore kept you au fait with developments in proceedings of the Committee as they occurred. We trust, however, you will be now able to expedite consideration of our recommendations, and that you will be prepared to sanction the specific recommendations made in our telegram of the 7th instant on an early date. We agree that, if you consider this necessary, your approval may be made subject to the issue of later instructions deferring any final action as to the Bill, if the reports of Local Governments are generally unfavourable to the main principles. But we beg of you most earnestly to accede to this request.
a &apos; [I .&quot;.jvIII.Telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, Home Department, dated 28th July 1922.2907. Your telegram dated 25th July. Trial by jury. Am I right in inferring from paragraph 3 that European Associations have seen whole scheme and concur in it, apart from Carey&apos;s signature of report ?IV.Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 31st July 1922.Your telegram of the 28th instant, 2907.   Racial Distinctions.1. Position as regards European Association is as follows: Carey and Gibbons, Advocate-General, though nominated at the instance of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, regarded themselves as representing European Association in proceedings of the Committee. After Committee had failed to come to an agree-ment in Delhi in March, arrangements were made for meeting of the Committee in Calcutta at beginning of May, when Committee could meet representatives of the European Association, including the President, Mr. Carr. These were the discussions in Calcutta referred to in paragraph 2 of our Home Department letter of the 8th June last.Previous to the discussions the European Association had consulted Mofussil Branches, and during the discussions the President of the Association, Mr. Carr, assisted by Mr. Ross Alston, a leading English barrister, met certain influential non-official members of the Committee and the Law Member. Result of the compromise then arrived at may be regarded as represented by draft report enclosed with letter of the 8th June. Then followed the meetings at Simla between 10th June and 14th June, when final report was signed. Carey attended those meetings, and was in telegraphic communication with European Association throughout their course. He signed the report on the 14th June, subject to a minute, and he left questions whether any minute would be written at all, and if written, form it should take, until he could discuss final conclusions with European Association in Calcutta. In order to assist him in such discussion he was supplied with a complete precis of the recommendations in the final report, but not with copy of the final report itself. Carey&apos;s minute and Gibbons&apos; signature to report and minute are believed to be the result of those final discussions between Carey and European Association in Calcutta. The European Association may therefore be said to have seen the whole of recommendations.2. We are enquiring from Mr. Carey as to whether this is accepted as a correct presentation of the facts, and will telegraph his reply later.V.Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 4th August 1922.Our telegram of the 31st ultimo. Racial Distinctions. Intimation received from Mr. Carey that presentation of facts in my telegram of 31st July is accepted by the President of the European Association as correct. The President of the Association further intimates that the Council of the Association are prepared to concur in legislation embodying the scheme in the report, and in Carey&apos;s minute of dissent, although it is not all they hoped for.VI.Telegram from the Bengal Chamber of Commerce to the Private Secretary to the Secretary of State, dated 5th August 1922. European Association and Bengal Chamber of Commerce press for early publication of Racial Distinctions Report, and in view of early retirement of Law and Home Members and their intimate knowledge of subject respectfully urge legislation September Session on lines of report and Carey&apos;s assenting minute as regards summons cases, which is regarded as essential.
Telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, Home Department, dated 4th August 1922.Racial Distinctions. Your telegram dated 81st ultimo. Letter dated 10th April from European Association to Air Ministry received here calls attention to possible effect of proposals on British soldiers, and states that Commander-in-Chief in India has been addressed on that subject. Have you received and considered such a reference &apos;? I presume you have considered independently effect of proposals on section 41 Army Act, though this has not been mentioned in report or correspondence.VIII.Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 9tli August, 1922.Your telegram 3011, dated 4th August.   Racial Distinctions.1. Communication in question was received by Commander-in-Chief and a note by the Adjutant-General and the Judge Advocate-General on the position of the European soldier which was based in part on the communication in question, was placed formally before the Government of India, and was considered. We think that there is nothing in the reference which makes it necessary, or even to any extent desirable, to defer action on the report. We note that His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief has throughout taken an active part in the examination and discussion of the whole subject.2. Section 41 of the Army Act provides inter alia for offences which may and may not be tried by Courts Martial. Section 549 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the Governor-General in Council to make rules as to cases in which persons subject to military law shall be tried by a Court under the Code or by a Court Martial. The rules&quot;:i:&apos; now in force are those printed at page 1408 of Volume III of General Statutory Rules and Orders, Edition 1915. None of these provisions is directly affected by the proposals in the report, as it is not proposed to amend Section 549 which is the only provision which can be amended by the Indian Legislature.It has never, so far as we are aware, been suggested that Section 549 is not an effective protection, and there is no reason why its effectiveness should be impaired in any way by the proposals in the report.3. It is true that the areas in which jurisdiction of Courts Martial is barred for five specified offences in Proviso (a) to Section 41 will be greatly increased by proposal to make Courts of Session competent Courts for the trial of European British subjects. For these offences also persons subject to military law will be triable by Court of Session, and possibly, if racial considerations do not arise, with the aid of assessors, and not by jury. These offences are few, and in cases in which death sentences are passed, the provisions as to confirmation, to which we referred in paragraph 5 (g) of our Home Department letter of the 8th June, 1922, will apply, and we would also invite a reference to our remarks regarding assessors in paragraph 4 b of our telegram of the 7th July. Other offences will continue to be triable by Courts Martial.In none of these respects, however, are provisions of Army Act affected, and the same applies to wives and dependents of soldiers who are, of course, affected by the proposals in the report in the same way as are other European British subjects in India.* Reproduced below.Copy of Rules referred to in the preceding Telegram.General Rules and Orders made under General Acts of the Governor-general in Council.The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (V of 1898).Trial of Persons subject to Military Law.No. 817-jF., dated the Z3rd May, 1902.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. &quot;J(Printed for the Cabinet.&apos;    &apos; November 1922.&quot;) P.L.I. 3.       &apos; &quot; . .   &apos;CABINET.Committee to consider proposed Indian Legislation to amend the Criminal Procedure affecting the Trial of Europeans.Statement showing the Privileges enjoyed under the existing Law by European British Subjects in the matter of Criminal Trials, and the Proposals of the Committee for alteration of the Law.(Unless otherwise stated, references to Sections are to Sections of the criminal procedure Code, 1898.)GENERAL EXPLANATIONS.A District Magistrate (who is almost always a member of the Indian Civil Service, but not therefore necessarily a European) is the executive head of a District-an area roughly analogous to an English County. He exercises a number of functions which are not judicial and can devote little of his time to the trial of cases. But he controls all the Subordinate Magistrates in a district, and can transfer cases from and to their files.Presidency Magistrates exist only in the three Presidency towns of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. They correspond roughly to Stipendiary Magistrates in London, and their duties are almost entirely judicial. They have slightly larger powers than the ordmary &quot; First-class Magistrate,&quot; and are usually recruited from the Bar. The number of salaried Presidency Magistrates is 6 in Calcutta, of whom 2 are now Europeans. 7 in Bombay, of whom 2 are now Europeans. 8 in Madras, of whom 1 is now European.But there are large numbers of Honorary Presidency Magistrates, most of whom are Indians.A First-class Magistrate is a Magistrate holding first-class powers. There are three classes of magistrates&apos; powers, which vary mainly in respect of the amount of punishment which may be inflicted. The bulk of First-class Magistrates are Indians, and members of the provincial Civil Services. The extent of their powers of sentence are explained under head B. of the Statement.A Sessions Judge presides over a Court of Session, of which there is one in each District. His full title is District and Sessions Judge, and as District Judge he is the highest civil judicial officer in the District : as Sessions Judge he is the highest Criminal Court in the District. He hears civil appeals from the Subordinate Civil Courts, and criminal appeals from decisions of Eirst-class Magistrates. He is himself directly subordinate to the High Court of the Province. The majority (but not all) of District and Sessions Judges are members of the Indian Civil Service, but are becoming increasingly Indian.Criminal cases, to reach a Sessions Court, must be committed thereto by a Magistrate. All trials in a Sessions Court are conducted either by jury or with the aid of assessors. A judge is not bound by the opinions of assessors. The extent to which he is bound by a jury&apos;s verdict is explained under head C. of the Statement.The High Courts of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay have original criminal jurisdiction which is conterminous with the boundaries of the Presidency town, and therefore act as Sessions Courts for these areas. A Presidency Magistrate who &quot; commits &quot; a case consequently commits it to the High Court Sessions.A (District) Sessions Court can pass any sentence authorised by law, but a sentence of death must be confirmed by the High Court before it can be executed.A High Court Judge sitting in Sessions can pass any sentence authorised bylaw, and there is at present no appeal against his decisions. In High Court Sessions all cases are tried by a jury of nine.5894      100   11.22A
A.-Jurisdiction of Courts.444.Existing Law.magistrates&apos; courts.The following only have jurisdiction over European British Subjects : (i) District Magistrates.(ii) Presidency Magistrates.(iii) European first-class Magistrates who have been appointed Justices of the Peace.(Justices of the Peace are specially appointed by the Governor-General in Council or the Local Governments under section 22, and, except in the case of Sessions Judges, District Magistrates and Presidency Magistrates, who are&quot; J.P.&apos;s ex-officio (section 25), only European British subjects can be so appointed.)sessions courts.The. Sessions Judge of the District, whether he is European or Indian, can try a European ; but no Additional Sessions Judge has jurisdiction unless he is a European British subject, and no Assistant Sessious Judge has jurisdiction unless he (i) is a European British subject ;(ii) has at least three year&apos;s experience as Judge ; and(iii) is  specially   empowered   to   try Europeans.Proposed Modifications.i.-as regards &quot;personal jurisdic-tion &quot; of courts.(i) To abolish the racial qualification for the office of Justice of the Peace, and to enable any Magistrate holding first-class powers to try a European.(ii) To enable any Magistrate of whatever class to try a European if the offence is one punishable only with fine not exceeding Rs. 50.(iii) To remove the racial and &quot; expe-experience &quot; bar from &quot;the jurisdiction of Additional and Assistant Sessions Judges.ii. special provisions as regards the forum of trial for &quot; racial cases.&quot;&apos; (i) To provide that when the case is punishable with imprisonment and is a &quot; sum-tnous case &quot; (i.e., punishable, with less than six months&apos; imprisonment), and one of the parties is a European and the other an Indian, or when both parties are of the same nation-ality but &quot; racial considerations &quot; are none the less involved, either party shall have the right to apply to the trying Magistrate for transfer to a special bench of two First-class Magjs-trat.es, one European and one Indian, and a right to appeal to the Sessions Judge against a refusal to grant such an application.If on such trial the two Magistrates differ in opinion, their opinions and the record to be laid before the Sessions Judge, to pass judg-meut in accordance with law after taking such further evidence as he desires.(ii) To provide that outside the Presidenc;i towns when an European is accused by an Indian (or vice versa), or when both parties, being of the same nationality, &quot; racial cp -siderations&quot; are none the less involved, and the offence is a &quot;warrant case &quot; (i.e., punish-able with more than six months&apos; imprison-ment) and would ordinarily be triable by a Magistrate, either party shall have the right to apply to the trying Magistrate for committal to the Sessions Court for trial by a jury pf which not less than half the members shall be of the nationality of the accused with a right of appeal to the Sessions against refusal of such an application.Note. Three European members of the Committee recommend that this provision should ajmly to &quot; racial &quot; summons cases also, instead of that proposed under head II. (i) above.B. Restrictions on Powers of Courts to sentence Europeans.presidency magistrates.No restrictions other than those applicable in all trials ; namely, they may pass sentences of imprisonment up to two years, of fine up to Rs. 1.000, and of whipping up to 30 strokes.It is proposed to enable all Courts %o exercise the same powers in the matter of sentencing Europeans as they can exercise in sentencing Indians, including (in the case of Sessious Courts) the power to pass   death
existing law.tie. district   magistrates cannot ordermore than six months&apos; imprisonment or Rs. 2,000 fine (as compared with two years&apos; imprisonment, fine of Rs. 1,000, or whipping, which they may order in the case of an Indian accused). If the District Magistrate considers the offence is not adequately punish-able within these limits, he must commit the m/r (l). accused to the Sessions.no. other    first-class    magistrateshaving jurisdiction&apos; cannot order more than three months&apos; imprisonment or Rs. 1,000 fine (as compared with two years&apos; imprison-tie. merit, or Rs. 1,000 fine, or whipping, which they may.order in the case of an Indian accused). If the Magi sir ate considers the offence is not adequately punishable within these limits, he must commit the accused to the Sessions.449 (i). sessions courts&apos; powers of fining are not limited, but they cannot order more than one 3^ear&apos;s imprisonment, nor can they pass a sentence of whipping. If they consider the offence proved, and that it cannot adequately be punished by one year&apos;s imprisonment, they must transfer the case to the High Court. 447(2). gut no Sessions Court can try a European on a charge punishable with death or transport-tation when a Magistrate commits on such a charge (a list of the offences involved is attached as an Appendix to this note), it must be to a High Court. And no alteration of the law in this respect can be made by the Indian Legislature without the previous sanction of the Secretary of State in Council (section 65 (3) Government of India Act). (This is the only case in which the Government of India Act specifically requires the previous assent of the Secretary of State in Council to the intro-cluction of legislation.)No restrictions.Proposed Modifications.sentences, subject to confirmation hy the High Court, except that-(i) for the present no Magistrate (other than a Presidency Magistrate, who has the power at present) nor Sessions Court shall have power to sentence a European British subject, as now to be defined, to whipping ;(ii) no Magistrate having the special (enhanced) powers conferable under sec-tions 30 and 34 is to exercise more than his  ordinary  powers  in   sentencing   a -European British subject. Further it is proposed that the expression &quot;High Court,&quot; which for the purpose of juris-cliction over European British subjects includes only the Chartered High Courts and the Chief Court of Lower Burma, shall be extended to include the Judicial Commissioner^ Courts in the Central Provinces, Oudh, Sind, and Upper-Burma.high courts.C-Special Provisions as to Juries.sr.50.(a) cases in which jury trial may be claimed.An Indian is triable by jury.

An Indian accused has no say in the selection of assessors.The provisions of law (which it is not proposed to change) in respect of the operation of a jury&apos;s verdict, should be noted.
