These conversations will be resumed in Paris at an early date.The task of restoring conditions favourable to economic stability in Europe continues to give Me deep concern. The difficulties are great and complex, and can only be overcome by patient and sincere co-operation between the nations primarily affected.Members oe the House of Commons,I thank you for the provision you have made for the public service.My Lords and Members op the House of Commons,I have given My assent to measures for the final enactment of the Constitution of the Irish Free State, and for the consequent necessary provisions. It is My earnest prayer that the passing of these measures may mark the inauguration of a period of prosperity and concord both for Ireland and for Great Britain.An Act has been passed to continue and extend the measures already taken for improving trade, and My Ministers will continue to examine with great care all possible measures for dealing with Unemployment.The condition of the agricultural industry, which is unfortunately passing through a period of serious depression, is receiving the careful consideration of My Ministers in the hope that means may be found to alleviate some of the difficulties confronting both farmers and labourers.I have assented to a Bill to give effect to the agreement entered into by My late Government with the representatives of the Government of My Dominion of Canada, for the amendment of the law with respect to the landing of imported animals in Great Britain.It is My earnest prayer that the blessing of the Almighty may rest upon all your labours.
