Hie &quot;International Eress Correspondence&quot;, whioh isone of the official organs of the Communist International&apos; and the English edition of which has, in the past, beenedited by Philips Price, contained on November 16th (He99)a report from a speeoh made by Zinoviev to the central committee of the International Communist Party on theI-ourth ?/orld Congress.    The following extracts are taken from this speeoh&quot;The communists form an international party. The task undertaken by the Communist International from its first foundation has been the creation of an international communist organisation, established on definite lines, and led from one centre on the plan of democratic centralism...&quot;When we review the activity of the Comintern In its relation to the coming Fourth Congress, wo can by no moans maintain that the Third International has already succeeded in fully performing the task set. The difficulties besetting the way are still enormous... .ni,..Experience has shown that the results of the activity of the Comintern are more successful from year to year.   And to-day, during the 4th year of existence of the Cc-mnrunist International, its executive committee is on the road to becoming an actual International Central Committee of the Communist Party, with organisations covering almost the entire globe...&quot;In the interval between the 3 and 4 congresses, that is, within 15 months, the Executive has held 30 sessions.   The total number of participators In these sessions (repeated participation being counted) is 1032. Those attending the sessions were approximately the same persons to the extent of one half.    The total number of questions treated at the sessions of the Executive was 144, of which 97 were purely political in character, and 47 were questions of organisation and administration.     The number of delegations appointed by the Executive for the various countries, in the name of the Comintern is 9.-,    (The majority of delegations were not appointed by the Executive, but by the Presidium;    delegations are only chosen by the Executive in especially important cases.)   During the period of which this report treats, 25 important resolutions were passed relating to the various countries. The most important proclamations and open letters confirmed by the Executive Committee itself amounted to 21.    31 commissions were appointed by the Executive itself.   Almost all these commissions consist of 7 to 9 persons.   Each one of these commissions forms in reality an actual international &quot;germ cell&apos;, comprising?as/
The following table shows the number of times the undermentioned countries were placed on the agenda:Germany............ 9France............. 9Poland............. north America..... . 5Czecho-Slovakia.... 5Italy.............. 4Yugoslavia......... 3baste.............. 3Spain.............. 3England............ 2Hungary............. 2Norway............. 2Bulgaria........... 2Roumania........... 2South Africa......* 2Austria............ 1South Amerioa...... belgium............ 1Canada............ o 1China.............. 1Russia............. 1Switzerland........ 1Finland............ 1Japan.............. 1&quot;It must further be added that during the period between the third and fourth congresses two sessions of the 2rtenfled Executive of the Comintern, at which all parties were doubly represented, were held,..     here Is no doubt whatever that the practice of holding enlarged sessions will take firm hold, and will prove of great utility...The number of sessions held by the Presidium between the third and fourth congresses was 75 (these data are not quite exact, the statistics having been worked through until 6th October only).     735 questions were treated at these sessions.    Hhe number of those present, including the specially invited representatives of the various parties, was 1152.   Here it must of course be recollected that several persons have been counted twiss, whilst the main body of the Presidium   remained unaltered.   The number of members of the presidency was 7 to 9 at most, but at the meetings 20 or even 30 persons were present, as when the qtaestion under discussion involved the party of this or that country; it was natural that comrades from the country in question were invited, so that the matter could receive enlightenment from all sides.n1!he questions treated by the presidency come under the following categories;United front tactics................... 22 timesProfintern............................. 10 nInternational Young People&apos;s Movement.. 21 n Preparation of questions for theExecutive of the Comintern......... 25 wQuestions of organization.............. 37 MPublication questions.................. 28 &quot;International Workers1 Relief.......... 15 &quot;international ional Women1s Soot ion.......... 6 &quot;Sport International.................... 4 nCo-.Kjperat.1yve Sec t ion. .................. 4 &quot;   Cont *d/as it does, alxao-et^ different parties.

Each of these commissions consisted as a rule of 3 to 5 eomrafles from the parties of the various countries, and also represented an important *germ cell&apos;.     Sisoh of these commissions is a small international in itself and at the same time a severe school.&quot;Hiese are most important figures characterizing the activity of the leading organ of the Comintern during the last 15 months.&quot;Our international organ was for the first time successful in carrying through 3 large and comprehensive international campaigns, in a more or less satisfactory manner:   1.    2he campaign associated with the united front
tactics;    2.    The campaign resultant on the SR. Trial and 3. &quot;Bib campaign for famine aid in Russia.   All this represents of course a mere beginning, a first hesitating step.   But it is of importance that the beginning has been made.    When it is added that the Executive of the Comintern is widely ramified, and that its activity is closely bound up with the work of the Profintern, the International Youth, the International Women&apos;s Section, the Co-operative Section, the International labour Famine Aid, the Sport Section, the language groups, etc, it will be seen that the work increases constantly in extent.&quot;Actual working practice in our International Central Committee has shown the necessity of some serious reforms. She fourth congress will devote attention to these reforms. It is probable that the Executive will have to create a number of sections:   for organisation, for agitation, etc after the manner of the sections of the central committee of the Russian Communist Party.    It is also possible that the Executive will find itself obliged to create an or-bureau and a pol-bureau, such as exist not only in the Russian (Xsmmunist Party but in the communist parties of many other lands.&quot;The Comintern does not regard its Executive Committee as a commission for making agreements only, but as a leading organ.   It is only natural that the Executive Committee should be obliged to &quot;interfere1 In the affairs of almost all the parties belonging to the International.     The Executive of the Comintern and its presidency have dozens of times treated in detail, the most important questions appearing on the agenda of the French, Italian, Czecho-Slovakian, and other great parties, during the year of this report.   The statistics above quoted demonstrate this clearly.   The &apos;record figures&apos; apply to just those countries in which the party has undergone arises and internal conflicts during this time.&quot;The Executive of the Comintern has taken active part in the preparations for every congress and conference of its largest parties.    She theses and resolutions intended to be laid before the congresses of this or that party have as a rule been first submitted to the Exeautive of the Communist International or to the presidium.     Representatives of the Executive Committee have taken part in nearly all Important congresses of the sections of the Comintern, giving spiritual direction to these congresses.    The Presidium of the Executive Comrj 2*rfcee has been enabled to gain a fairly exact knowledge of the personality of the leadership of our most Important parties.   The Executive Committee has been energetic in its endeavours to further the political initiative of those sections compelled to face particularly complicated situations.   Hie Executive and the presidency have devoted special attention to the young     j parties taking their first steps in the direotion of political: mass fighting.   With the co-*operation of the Bxeoutive fCommittee organized political parties and groups have been     ;! formed, within the last 15 months, in such oountries as Egjjpt Japan, China, Turkey, India and Persia, that Is, in oountries possessing only very small circles of followers at the time of the Shird Congress.    These parties are still weak in numbers, but the kernel Is at least formed.   In 1883the/
the group for *IdJberatlo^of&apos; Xahaor1 in Russia waa also only a very small one...&quot;The actual formation of the International Central Committee of the Coiamunist organisations of the world is a mighty evidence of progress.&quot;The international &quot;bourgeoisie cannot be conquered without the aid of a. united, organised, and systematically working international xoroletarian centra.     It is not even possible to take measures likely to succeed In any great   5 degree against the wild campaigns of the capitalists, or against the innumerable betrayals of social democracy, if the Comintern abandons any essential feature of the basic principles laid down in its most important programmatic documents.    The international cooatmist movement needs the support of a strong staff, of a mighty intei-nat ional central committee whose judgments are decisive.    The communist parties of the whole world will create this staff, and will establish it firmly.&quot;Boc100 of the &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot; alsodated November 16th was devoted likewise to the World congress and contained certain passages which appear worthy of quotationin that they are an accurate reflex of the bolshevik outlookon the international situation:fiffSKY &quot;On this anniversary of the Soviet Republic it is with Germany alone that the. republic holds normal relations.    All the other great powers have not yet recognised the Soviet government de ^ jure.    But the working class of all countries recognises&apos;and fraternally supports the Soviet power.    The bourgeois powers are holding back their recognition, for they still hope that even in Russia capitalism will return.    But they wait in vain.    Soviet Russia will hold out, and j^atiently await the development of. the world revolution.      The Russian workers, the army, and the peasantry are united, and work in common for the realisation of Socialism...07I2Y itjn England development Is slow.   England is not a country of great political organisations.    The lack of revolutionary experience In England is a ca se of great difficulty to our party there...&quot;In Japan a communist party has been formed.&quot;In India we have successes to record.&quot;Wo have also groups in Ugy.pt;, Persia, China.    This Is of the greatest importance for our fight against world imperialism. ..no..The English general election is being carried on with an incredible lack of ideas.    The struggle of the oolonised countries has reached a high level;    the liberation movement makes progress, despite the repressive measures taken by the imperialist governments.   this movement/
** &amp; *.movement is. not comnruniisrt^ &quot;but nonsthe less it is an influential factor in the proletarian s-fcruggle-f or freedom.&quot;Bourgeois democracy is in the process of decay..,&quot;These are however transition periods.    It is the duty of the communist parties to prepare the illegal period.    Such periods are no sign of a standstill in the world revolution.    On. the contrary, the effect is objectively most revolutionising.    The path described by the world revolution is not a straight line...&quot;.. * The workers1 government is the concrete application of the united front:    it will only be possible to realise it in exceptional cases,-    The workers1 government is not an essential organic period df transition;    it does not displace the dictatorship and cannot avoid the sufferings of civil war.    The communist * groups in the factories and workshops, and among the shop stewards, constitute the criterion for the influence of the Communist Party.&quot;Every labour government can become the transition point for the dictatorship.    It is not the form but the political content that oounts.    The most important thing is:    the bourgeoisie will not willingly resign its privileges.     Therefore the overthrow of the bourgeoisie must be   first brought about.. *&quot;We must combat every illusion that the labour government signifies a peaceful and painless transition. The labour government is no substitute for the dictatorship or for the civil war.v.&quot;colmttnstsThe outstanding events in the commmuaist world last week most    the sucoess of the candidates Ilewbold and    Saklatvala, the former tinder a communist label.It is reported that a Press representative who enquired at the Communist Headquarters as to whether ITewbold would take the Oath of Allegiance was informed that there would be &quot;no practical difficulty about the matter&quot;:   it w$s admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary that the Oath might not conform to the principles and aims of the Party but he added that &quot;it is all a matter of expediency.&quot;     In this connection it is of interest to note that it is a cardinal communist principle that no patrt or vow with or under any &quot;Capitalist&quot; Government is binding.NeWbold/

The sub-editors were Palme Butt, Holmes (&quot;Gadfly&quot; of the &quot;Daily Herald&apos;&apos;7)p Wintringham, Page Axnott^ McAlpine, Arthur Reads, former editor of the &quot;Fx-ee Oxford&quot; and Wo Paul.The Australian Government has requested that passport facilities be refused to Bora Montefiore, who wished to visit Australia for some months on account of her health: the refusal of the passports, however, does not necessarily restrict the movements of extremists, as Harry Webb and Jack Leckie have both reached Moscow without British papers.It is reliably reported that the interview with Benin published in the  &quot;Conrrainlst Bally&quot; and quoted in my last report was given to Harry Webb and sent over in the official bag of the Russian Trade Delegation.- 7 -

Various measures for raising money are contemplated including the sale of busts of Lenin and Trotsky by Clare Sheridan and of Russian postage stamps.On November 18th Paine Dutt was present at a meeting of group leaders in Barking Road and enquired if anyone had a wireless installation:    as no one possessed a set he said &quot;We must find new members in this direction and if any member cares to take up wireless and use it at times in the direction indicated, we will finance him up to 5$f0 of the costs.&quot;     One member was prepared to accept this offer and his case Is to be considered by Hoadquarters.Inkpln, Boll and Jackson   have had their salaries increased to  5 per week.Francis Meynell is reported to be In Russia:   in August last he applied for a passport for France and Germany, &quot;for the purpose of bibliographical research respecting in particular the 16th Century printers of Lyons.gHB HKD UraSRMATIOJSrAL OF LABOUR IMIOHiBAccording to a statement issued by Harry Pollitt this month the circulation of &quot;All Power&quot; is now 12,000 copies per month.

Northern and Midlands contingents total approximately 600 and are      rough       types:   more than half of them carry strong sticks when marching, sticks which are described as &quot;obviously too heavy&quot; for walking.tlhe Sovsh Yiiales and Plymouth contingents total 150: only a small percentage carry sticks and their general appearance is the same as that of the men who usually participate In London demonstrations:02ie Kent contingents, including men from Cr^yford and Erith now total about 350 and are men of a type far superior to that of the other marchers, many of them wearing war medals:   they have not so far carried stioks or any offensive weapons.On November 17th some 2,000 unemployed including the men from the provinces marched to Hyde Park where a crowd of between 6,000 to 7,000 was waiting for them:    short speeches were made by lie Hay (Manchester), Cttrrie (Dumfries) and Riley (Ramsgate):    all declared that they were determined not to leave London until the Prime Minister had promised work or full maintenance on a national scale.   Ewnnington said that the unemployed marchers would be instructed to stay in London until the Prime Minister had received a deputation and that a conference would be held at Headquarters on November 20th to decide what steps should be taken in the event of the Prime Minister&apos;b continued refusal to receive a deputation.Various comparatively small open-air and indoor meetings have been held during the last jfew days at which contingent leaders have spoken:   the main note of the speeches has been determination to see the Prime Minister.     On November 19th, however, about 3,000 people, half of whom were unemployed, assembled in Drsfalgar square and were addressed by their own speakers and Shapurji s&amp;kl^tvala, M.P.     3fce following are extracts from the more important speeches:-W. H^miingt on/
W. Hannlngton (London)&quot;Two letters have been received fromJBonarLaw -s-ta-ting.,- -that he cannot interview the marchers.   I am going to say r this, that Sonar Law will undoubtedly change his mind very considerably.   He has suggested that the marchers can see the Minister of Health and the Minister of Labour.   We are not going to be put off in that sort of fashion.    She nin-cum-poops of the Government are not sufficient for us to interview.   We want to get at the actual fountain head.   Bonar Lav; must remember this...   Let me say this also, that the Authorities have endeavoured to stop the marchers from the very commencement by all the means in their power.   One cowardly action has been the action of preventing the wives and kiddies of these men living or existing as they should exist whilst they are on the road. By that I mean, that they are going to stop, or rather they are going to endeavour to stop the benefit that is due to these men from the State Unemployment Insurance Scheme... These men are not leaving Lon; on until they have interviewed Bonar Law and they are going to see to it, going to use every power they have, to see to it that their dependents are not robbed of what they are entitled to because they have come on the march...&quot;f. McKay;(Manchester).&quot;We are not come to London for the purpose of sight-seeing, the only sight-seeing we are coming to do is to see Mr. Bonar La1;/ on Wednesday next, and a word of advice to Mr. Boner Law as to his future, might not be out of place. I oan tell Mr. Bor,&amp;r Law from this platform that the Manchester men at least, are determined that they have not marched to London and endured all the hardships without getting seme definite kind of promise...&quot;S. Saklatvala, (London)&quot;1 hope that the unemployed of this country will now make up their minds that they have great evidence of what the revolutionary members of the Labour Party have been trying to preach in vain.   Wo have been trying to preach for all these years that the happiness and success of mankind   ; does not lie in the improvement of wages or in our conciliation laws.   We have been telling you ever since the revolutions in Russia of 1917 that mankind has discOTered another cure for unemployment...    If it was a nation of any self respect and any imagination, last Wednesday when the nation had 600 soft jobs at  400 a year at its disposal, the nation with any live revolutionary spark in it would have put 600 unemployed in it, but they have not done it.    They have put some ha If-employed mugs like me in it...    I v&amp;nt you all to be the machinery, to be the teachers of the gospel of the revolutionary working olasB movement of this country...    You have come to see the Prime Minister.    Sao him.   What will you say to him?..Ask him if he is going to bo a conservative and conserve the condition of the unemployed as it is, or if he Is?oing to be a revolutionary and alter your condition of ife.    If he promises to be a revolutionary, then ask him to lead the revolution.... You must stick up for yourselves.   If you do not you are fools to yourselves.&quot;G. Garrett/
g. , arrgtt^ (Liverpool)*&quot;We qame here determined to see someone.   We are go ing,. to see that someone because we have the determination.   We realise the possibilities that are likely to arise out of a situetion of this description.   Dovaa the possibilities, we are prepared.   Only two thousand are prepared.   where is your preparation, where is your determination?...    I am a Communist, yes, and proud of it.   I am a Communist, not because I like being one.   Conditions have made me a rebel. Conditions are rotten.    Out of rotten conditions you get dissatisfied persons.    I have been thrown up.    Your conditions are bad.    Your place is with us.    In conclusion let me finish with the war cry of 1916 when Jin Connelly-put his name to that declaration, TUp uhe Rebels1.&quot;Gordon Currie (Dumfries)&quot;All I have to say is that the unemployed will not be side tracked, and they will insist in no uncertain manner to see Mr. Bonar L*:-w, and if we don&apos;t see him there will be rhe 111...     Wo are men and believe we have a grievance, not only against the Government but against Society...WG c&amp;U you to the Colours to fight against those things, and it is not merely a fight for 36/- a week, for the national demands, . In my estimation it is a fight for possession.    It is a fight for the workshops and the factories, for the land, for the things that go to make life worth living.    That is the fight j. the greatest fight. No matter how many doles you get, so long as Capitalism remains in existence, so long as a small class owns end controls everything, you will always be slaves.   Rally to the red banner of International freedom.    Gird on the armour and victory will be yours.&quot;H. Newbpld, (Barrow-in-Furness[)&quot;But the time has arrived when we as workers have to harness ourselves in order to &quot;bring about the complete destruction of the Capitalist system, in order to throw off our backs once and for all the parasitical class who are sucking the very life!s blood out of our cIbbb all over the world...5. Cooke, (iiltrlncham)&quot;We are informed at this juncture that Mr. Bonar Law will not see us, but we are determined that we shall see him, although No. 10, Downing Street is barricaded.     We are In London now and we remain in London until such times as Bonar Law will Interview the unemployed, and if necessary, I for one am prepared to walk back to Lancashire and bring up reinforcements, and I know we can get them...    75$ of the men who came on the march from Manchester are ex-service men and we came up in Military formation, all the way from Manchester with our commanding officer, our battalion sergeant-major, and we were so military disciplined that we were nothing short but ammunition, and I believe we can get the ammunition when it is necessary, and I do not give a damn whether we use it this next week or the week after...     Wo are going to see the premier whether it be in 10, Downing Street or in the House of Commons when Parliament opens.   Now then, you have said&quot;hear/
^ear, hearT, many of you.   I wonder how many of you will ho on parade when I give the word of command&quot; that we have to make an attack on the House of Commons...    We have marched from Manchester;    from Scotland;    from every part of the country, with a definite object in view, and that object is to place the case of the unemployed before the Prime Minister, and we are going to place that case no matter what obstacle they may attempt to put in our way*&quot;So far as I am concerned,  I do not care a damn if I gat killed in the attempt, because we may as well be killed outright as be allowed to die of starvation, and what is more if Bonar Law vvill not see us on Wednesday, we shall remain in London until he does see us.&quot;Over and above that I Qm. prepared to tramp bask to Manchester and bring another contingent of 2,COO strong, and we shall keep bringing our reinforcements. Wo would have brought with us from Manchester over 2,000 only we- realised that food and housing facilities would not be available for that number, but if the Government like to defy the Organisation, then we will defy the Government, and we will feed the contingents by force if necessary o&quot;I am informed that Dovning Streat is barricaded.    I don1-; care a damn as an individual for their barricades. In the war we used a tank to rright for small nations&apos;. In this was we are going to use our voices first.    If that brings no result there is only one course left to us and - God help the Authorities...&quot;If we are to have a fight at all, let us have a fight on the main issue, and not for the sake of a little policeman.    If our heads are worth batoning at all, they are worth it because of a big grievance, and I tell you definitely that so far as the marchers are concerned,  vne are prepared to stop in London sis months unless the Premier sees us before that time*..     When we were on the road we had occasion to put up for the night outside a small village, and they told us that they could not find us food,.   We simply told the men to go and get the food and they got it.    The same thing will apply in London, if necessary...&quot;J. Steele,  (London)&quot;You have heard the last speaker Comrade Cooke, and I think yon will agree with me that he breathes the spirit of-the true rebel, and that, in common with others of the Manchester contingent, he is prepared to demand and force the right to see Bonar Law.    If we cannot see him we shall see his relative Martial Law...&quot;j. Riley,  (Ramsgate)&quot;We of the Rtansgate contingent don&apos;t care a damn for Bonar Law or any other bloody law.    We are not going back to Hemsgate until we have attained the object for which we- marched to London.    If need, be, I oa prepared to go back to Ramsgate and fetch 500 other boys along/end we will get our grub, if not in the ordinary manner, then we will get it/
it in a way that some of you.know.   We oan tell Bonar Law that there is a greater power than any government... We will show the Bed Flag.    Fight on, fight on! and victory is yours.1     Be united, he solid;    the victory is won.    We will compel Bonar Law to listen to our demands. We don&apos;t care for the men in blue or the men in khaki. The time v/ill come when the workers will organise their own army, and God help thenu   We will be prepared to meet force with force, and we will fight on towards the goal that we are out for.&quot;T. Lingley,  ( Coventryj.&quot;Talking does nothing at all.   Action beats all lip service...    I ask you to get into the van of the revolutionary movement, break down the bai-ricade of the capitalist system and enter into the workers1 republic7&apos;.The following resolution was passed unanimously:-&quot;This mass meeting assembled together in Trafalgar Square, November 19th, 1922, hereby demands that the Premier shall meet the deputation of national hunger marchers from England, Scotland and. Wales, on Wednesday next, November 22nd.    We contend that the problem of unemployment Is of such a grave character that it necessitates the immediate attention of the Government and that the claim made on behalf of the unemployed by the N&amp;iiional Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee on the National Exchequer, is a justifiable claim and warrants the serious consideration of the Premier.&quot;On November 20th a conference of the leaders of the organised unemployed was held at the Brotherhood Church,Southgate Road:   Hogan (London) was in the Chair.    P. Haye,the national secretary of the movement, reported that thePrime Minister had definitely refused to receive a deputation and it was decided, in the event of the refusal being maintained, to march on Whitehall:   a committee of six was formed to decide ways and means, the members being:E.E. Newbold (Barrow^ McMahon (Barrow) Tudor (Lover) Lew -.r (Liverpool) Wilkinson (Lalton) lukeman (Inverness)It v^as arranged that this committee should selectez-U.C.0&apos;s. to take charge of the groups who were to attack the police and that   W. Harmingtcn, as &quot;Chief Marshal&quot; shouldnot be a member of the deputation, but should remain with themen/
men and direxrt- operations.     Htmalngfcon^stated that there was to he a fight if the deputation was refused a hearing and that if any man was not prepared to do this he had better stay home and not &quot;get hiding &quot;behind some monument.&quot;The deputation chosen to wait on the Prime Minister consisted of:P. Hayo, London) 6. Cocke, (Manchester) 6. Garrett,  (Liverpool) S. Ellas,  (Cardiff)G. Currie,  (Dumfries). T. Dingley,  (Coventry)H. Lawless,  (Walsall) J. Cameron,  (Newcastle)MeGinley, (salford) Tudor, (Dover) Rlley, (Eiimsgate) (?)       Eedsham,  (Leeds)With the exception of the last two, of whom nothing is known, all these men are communists.The meeting decided that the  39 obtained in Trafalgar Square on November 19th and all the collections taken by the marchers en route should be handed over to the National Administrative Council for organisation purposes:   20$ of the money taken at meetings in London was to be given to the .&quot; London District Council of the organised unemployed and the remainder divided between the various provincial committees.In   conclusion the Red   Flag was sting and every man was advised to &quot;take a day&apos;s rest ant! be prepared to fight&quot;.Owing partly to the intervention of George Lansbury and other Labour Members of Parliament, no effort was made to foroe a way to Downing Ssreet on November 22nd:   the deputation was received by the Minister of Labour and the Minister of   Health at the Ministry of Labour, but declined to discuss their oase in any detail.The main body of the unemployed, numbering about 7,000,assembled in Hyde Park, where speeches were made and theresult of the deputations interview announced:     the men thenreturned to their lodgings in an orderly manner: there seemslittle/
little doubt that many of them are discouraged and inclined to go home:   the more violent leaders still maintain that they will bring up Reinforcements&quot; to back their demand for an interview with the Prime Minister.A man named Henry Russell was arrested for obstructing the polioe and was fined 40/- at Bow street Police court on November 23rfi.IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINWhile the Irish in Great Britain generally approve the firm attitude of the Provisional Government in regard to armed rebels, they are anxious as to the outcome of it all.Art 0TBrien and his followers are very much upset over the turn of affairs.   0&apos;Brien says he fears it will smash the Republican Movement which, he admits, is losing in prestige all over the world.    He accuses the Free Staters of all sorts of crimes and says that as far as ho, himself, is concerned he will fight to the last.Art 0&apos;Brien recently sent a long report to Fshy at the Republican headquarters in Lublin.   He dealt with the work being done in Great Britain and said the machinery of the Republican Movement was again in complete working order. 0TBrien also supplied a number of extracts from the speeches of Mr. Bonar Law and Mr. Churchill dealing with the Treaty, which he said would be useful to de Valera as &quot;proving to the hilt that Ireland had been sold.&quot;A sensational story, printed in the Local newspapers, of Free State troops in uniform arresting &quot;Rebels^ in Birmingham has been enquired into by the Birmingham Police with a negative result.   A young man in uniform, believed to be that of the Irish Free State, stayed the night ofNovember/
