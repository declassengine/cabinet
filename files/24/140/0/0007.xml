&quot;The communist Daily&quot; of November 15th definitely claimed Philips Price as a CoramraiAst Party candidate.The results of Gallaohor1 s and No Ahold&apos;1 s candidatures at Dundee and Mctherwell are not yet known..(
THE COMMUNISMS&quot;The Qomrm.nl st-Dally&quot;, which first appeared onNovember 13th, has added very little to existing communist--   literature:   tlie Issue of November 14th, however, contained a &quot;Programme&quot; which bears quotation:&quot;      &quot;What is the Working Class Programme?&quot;The working class programme has to deal with something more than the mere election issues.    It Is only the capitalists who can confine themselves to the &quot;appeal to the ballot box&apos; once in five years. For the rest of the time they have no need of programme.   They rule.&quot;That gives the key to the working class programme.   As the workers, oppressed by the capitalists our programme must be &quot;our rule&apos;.&quot;What does our rule mean?&quot;It means the ending of exploitation and misery in every land.    The liberation of the toiling masses, and the millions of peasants in India and China.   It means the building of a workers&apos; society in which the wealth of all the world shall belong to the world&apos;s workers.    The coming of our rule ends the pre-historic period In the history of man.&quot;TMb is our programme.A HEAL CHANCE.&quot;Our programme cannot be achieved by the mere substitution of one set of persons at the top for another set of persons.   Such a process would leave untouched the capitalist army, the capitalist navy, the capitalist police, police courts, magistrates and judges - the whole apparatus of Government by which the workers are held down and terrorised.   It would leave untouched too, the power of the millionaires and their kept newspapers and their Tfreedom1 to poison line minds of the workers.   Therefore our programme goes I beyond the clamour of the elections.   We are not to ; be placated by the opportunity - once in five years ** of choosing &quot;His Majesty^ ministers and paying for this glorious opportunity by five intervening years ; of grinding wage-slavery.   Our programme must be the overthrow of the whole capitalist machinery of government, Not only Westminster, but Whitehall, and the Law Courts, and the barracks of the Guards.&quot;How are we to carry out this programme?   Is It something for the future?   No.   We must make a beginning now.    To-day we must resist the attacks of the capitalists.    To resist effectively we must unite.MUST ACHIEVE UNITY.&quot;They are beating us down in wages, in hours, in housing/
housing.   For two years now they have &quot;been forcing us back, casting us on the streets, robbing us and starving us.    The working class must unite to seize every point of attack and defence.&quot;We workers stand for a united resistance to the attack on wages.&quot;We workers stand united against longer hours.&quot;Two millions of us are unemployed, remorselessly flung on one side by the workings of capitalism. Employed and unemployed alike, we workers stand united in our demand for work and full maintenance.    By resisting together we can turn the defence into the attack.    We can press forward to wrest from the capitalists their grasp of the industries of the country and rule and direct those industries ourselves.&quot;We workers must stand together for nationalisation without compensation, and with Yvorkers1 control.&quot;These things in our daily employment we do.    But beyond that there is the menace the capitalists hang over us - the threat of war.CONSTANT WAR THREAT.&quot;The first great imperialist war ended in 1918. In the four years since the danger of another war has never been absent.    Only last year the war in the Pacific was nut off for a time until they could re-group their forces. This very Week war is hanging in the balance:    three days more and the workers may be sent to be slaughtered in the Near East.&quot;The workers have no enemies there.    Our enemies are in our own country.   We workers stand together against all imperialist wars.&quot;For this full stand, for this full attack, leading up to the overthrow of capitalism, the united working class is destined.    To fulfil this programme, to achieve this objective, there must be a lead for the working class.    Who is to lead them?&quot;The Communist Party alone stands for this full programme.&quot;The Communist party provides the lead for the working class.&quot;The first issue of &quot;The Communist Daily&quot; (November 13th) had a thick type heading &quot;LENIN ON THE ELECTION:    VOSE FOR A WORKERS1 GOVERNMENT&quot; toid an article written by one of the British delegates to the Moscow Conference in which it was stated that:&quot;Lenin is following the election in Britain withso/
so much concern that he readily granted an Interview,&quot;He considers the election of first rate importance, not onl?/ for the British working-class &quot;but also for the International proletarian Movement...&quot;The Communists, he thought, should tales the fullest advantage of the election to push forward the case for Communism, and, If possible, secure the return of a Workers&apos; Government.    Everything should be done, at the same time, to bring our Communist point of view before the largest possible masses of the workers by means of simple slogans and Soor to door canvassing. He is anxious that the party should enter into the election with practical and simple slogans and not make the mistake of stressing theoretical questions...&quot;Editions of *!he Communist Daily&quot; are being printed in London and Glasgow and 100 copies from the latter city are being sent to King Street each day, together with 50 copies of all election literature printed in Scotland:   the London issue bears the. imprint &quot;The Globe Rotary Press, Ltd., 367, Strand, W.C.H.&quot;:   R. Palme Dutt and William Paul are assisting in the editorial work and  J&amp;ckson has complained bitterly about the excessive rates demanded by printers: it appears that he is handicapped by the fact that the terms of the financial assistance for the paper stipulate that only a firm paying trade union rates shall print it.   It is reported that the distribution of the paper has been hampered by the fact that the organised unemployed committees have been flooded with free copies of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, which they were allowed.to sell after 10 a.nu, retaining half of the proceeds.On Hovember 10th the Communist Party sent another cheque for  100 to John Inches in Dundee and there appears to be no real shortage of money in connection with election propaganda.   A return of expenses incurred in connection with Newbold&apos;s candidature, made on November 11th, totalled  379.10.3. including  150 for nomination,  48.5.0. for hospitality,  80 for &quot;advertising bills, election address and Mrs. Hewbold&apos;a letter&quot; and  37 for halls.Gallacher/
&apos;%^allaofce^r^&apos;4^ think thathe has made progress and Ham Travers, the Glasgow Irishman, declares that he personally had &quot;a wonderful ovationT&apos;0   At a communist meeting in Aberdeen on November 12th Gallachor, in reply to a question as to whether, if returned to Parliament, he would take the Oath of allegiance, said that he would do so under protest and then break it if necessary.Jim Morton, George Ebury and Bert Joy were sent to Greenock last week to assist Goddes, who received from the Scottish Miners&apos; Federation Approved Society in Kirkcaldy  15 towards his depositsOrdinary communist activities have been more or less suspended during the election campaign but there seems no doubt that the systematic heckling and hooliganism in certain constituencies has been directly inspired from headquarters.Some progress is being made with the examination of the Central Training Group in London and special efforts are being directed to the capture of the Educational and Political Committee of the London Co-operative Society, which has about 100. COO members.&apos;Various branches are getting to grips with the work laid down in the Party Commission Report but there are indications that all members are not elated at the prospect of having to work harder in their leisure hours than at their regular employment.The following scheme for the reorganisation of the&quot;Party in Scotland has been drawn up by headquarters&quot;We are anxious to proceed as quickly as possible with the setting up of the new party organl-sation.    The first step is clearly the decision on the constitution of the districts:    the   next, the calling of special District Congresses to elect the new District Party Committees, which will take charge of the transition from the old to the new structure and the setting up of the new &apos;local organisations.&quot;In/
&quot;In Scotland, Glasgow is clearly-marked out as the centre of a district.    Edinburgh will similarly form the centre of a second district though the membership is here very small.    The question of the Eiie region is one of oenaiderable difficulty,  especially in view of the limited information available.&quot;31th regard to Glasgow., the Executive make the following re commend at ions *, A Glasgow district should be set up with centre in Glasgow,    We should like your opinion as to the best position for headquarters.    Glasgow Central is the strongest branch but has no rooms, meeting in the Scottish offices.    Glasgow Eastern has its own meeting roouu    The branches included in the Glasgow district would be as follows:-Centre;       Glasgow comprising the present branches of :-Glasgow Central         inning Park Glasgow Eastern        partick.Membership covered that of the above branches and also that of the branches:-PaisleyGreenockVale of levenKilmarnockTroonMilngavieAirdrieCcatb ridgeCambuslangChrystonMotherwellWishawSt one houseB o t hwe11haughDouglas WaterPlaintyreBeIlshillRenfrewC lei andClydebenk.&quot;The members of the District Party Committee would be drawn from the central branches and any of the members of adjacent branches who could fulfil the condition of being able to meet continuously at the centre.    The Branches of palkirk and Denny would not form part of the district.    The question of their future direction will be decided later..&quot;It is suggested that the District Congress for Glasgow should be held in Glasgow on December 23rd.    It is advisable to have this on a Saturday so that if necessary the Congress could continue in session on Sunday.    In any case, the new District Party Committee will have to hald a long session immediately following the Congress, and if, as is hoped, a representative from the Organising Bureau is present at the Congress he would attend the latter meeting also.    You should therefore try tq obtain a suitable room in Glasgow for the Congress meeting o December Zord, unless you feel that there are insuperable&apos; objections to this date in which case please communicate with us at once,,    The Congress can hardly be held earlier since a number of other districts are being set up in December and in each case the Executive-will have to go deeply into the question of local organisation so as to have concrete proposals for the new District Party Committee to work upon.&quot;We propose that the following further arrangements should /
should &quot;be made with regard to the Glasgow District cengrossIffl)     &quot;!Ehe Executive will send out, through you, a letter to branches explaining the new district organisation and instructing branches to elect representatives to the Congress at a specially sumiaoned meetings.    It is proposed that the basis of representation should be one lor every fifteen members, or part thereof, the number of credentials foiTTaab. branch to be determined by you according to your membership lists.(2)     &quot;The Divisional Executive should, if possible, be asked to elect a Chairman for the Congress.(3)     &quot;You should make arrangements to meet the expenses of the Congress by pooling fares or special levy.(4)     &quot;An -Agenda will be sent out with the Executive notice calling the Congress.    It will contain at least the following itemsa) b)0) d) e)f)g)(a)Chairman&apos;s remarks.Statement by Organiser and/or Executive representative.Discussion on district organisation. Decision on number of District Party Committee. Nominations for and election of District Party Committee.Nomination for and election of auditors. Discussion on maintenance of organiser and if possible decision on same.Discaission on setting up local organisations and further work required, e.g., completion of registers, preliminary to this.&quot;We hope shortly to send you as a guide a detailed memorandum on the Working of a District party Committee for the District.    &apos;Hhe question of local organisation and the setting up of local party committees will have to be taken up by the District, Party Committee when elected in conjunction with ths proposals which we will elaborate.&quot;With regard to the Edinburgh dig district, the Executive proposes the constitution&apos; to&quot; be as follbwsCentre:      Edinburgh with the membership of the Edinburgh and Ls ith branches.Membership covering that of the above two branches and also of the branches of:-Broxburn Tranent -Musselburgh.With regard to the Pife covered would be that of theBowhill Dochgelly Lumphinnans High Valleyfield Me thillNewton Pe no alt land Stoneyburndistrict the membership following branches:-Glencraig Cowdenbeath Dunfermllne E. Werayss Kirkcaidy.w*Jhe question of difficulty.   All thea District centre is branches are small.one of the utmost Eirkcaldy, the largest/
largest, has only 25 members-and is not centrally situated,,    Dunfermline Is the acting capital, the headquarters of the Fife miners and in close proximity to the naval hase at Rosyth, but on the other hand the branch there is very small and has no rooms.    Bowhill and Cowdenbeath presents a possibility as being centrally placed and containing members with the possibility of leadership.-Bit details as to to the membership of all the branches, and information as to the possibilities ol leadership and the character of the branches is so lacking that it is impossible at present to make any decision.     We should be glad if you could send us any Information available bearing on this question,   iit present it cannot even be . decided whether it would be advisable to take the lead for the district out of Fife and place it, e*g., in the hands of Glasgow.&quot;Dundee and Berth would certainly be excluded from the District.   As in the case of the Falkirk and Denny branches the question of their direction will have to be decided later.nA suggested grouping of the Lancashire division underthe new organisation is as follows:-Manchester DistrictManchester District Party Committee - Centre Manchester comprising the existing 5 branches:-Openshaw, Gorton,Manchester Central, levenshulme,Dukinfield (Ashton already absorbed by Openshaw).Membership of District to include the members of the following branches:-Openshaw, Gorton,Manchester Centre,Lovenshulme,S* Salford,Pendleton,Dukinfield,iiahton,Old ham,Rochdale,Bolton,Rawtenstall,Altrincham,Blah&amp;bum,Flixton, andWigan.Liverpool. DistrictLiverpool District Party Committee - Centre Liverpool comprising the existing three branches:-Central/
Central Liverpool. East Liverpool, and Edgehill.Membership of district to include that of followingbranches :Liverpool Central, Liverpool East,Edge Hill, Birkenhe ad, Wallasay,Garstcn,St. Holens, Warr ington, Earlestown, Leigh.With reference to Ty Ides ley and Accrington Branches these two branches are now defunct.&quot;Headquarters do not approve of all these suggestions andare likely to amend them on the following lines:&quot;Re suggestion to include Dukinfield branch in the Manchester Central region, there is no difficulty here as long as the comrades at Dv.ki.nfleId branch are able to meet at the district Hoedquarters with the noocscary continuity. But if they are included there seems no reason why Fondle ton should not, also be included.    Those branches were distinguished as central which would provide most of the District Party Committee and members able to work in the different departments at the district centre.    .4 member of the District party Committee may be elected from any branche in the district so long as he is able to satisfy the Congress as to being able to attend regularly at the district headquarters,  if necessary almost every day.    This applies,  of course,  to any comrade of any branch in the      : district, and he does not need to be a representative at the District Congress in order to be nominated and elected to the District party Committee.&quot;With regard to your suggested transference of certain branches from Manchester to Liverpool, you give no reasons &apos; for the proposal, aad as the organising bureau has carefully considered the position of each branch, it sees no ground for altering its decision.    Leigh is certainly In the Manchester District     Warrington is exactly half way, and as Manchester is the more important district centre and will have a larger District Party Committee, and a larger number of comrades available, it seems desirable to include Warrington ir. this district,    St. Helens and Sarlestown are both miring localities, while Liverpool Is rather a transport centre.    For this reason as well as the former, and the fact that the reliability of the Party lead from Liverpool is at the present moment much more doubtful than that from. Manchester, the Executive be Have that at present it will be best to attach both these branches to the Manchester District.&quot;I        A district congress will be held at the Socialist Hall, Margaret street, Openshaw on December 2nd in order finally tosettle/
to the following branches :-Openshaw Gorton Manchester Central LevenshulmePendleton LuklnfieldOldham RochdaleBolton RawtenstallAltrincham BlackburnFlixton WiganLeigh St. HelensAccrington HarringtonTyldeslffy BarlestownL.N. Larkin has resigned the secretaryship of the class War prisoners&apos; Release Committee and Harry Pollitthas taken his place:    the assistant secretary is W.T. Co Dyer,the extremist, who was deported from America a few months ago.COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSESThe &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot; for November10th contains glowing accounts of the opening of theCommunist Congress at Petrograd and Moscow.

On that day, at 2 p.m., in Hyde Park, there will be a great demonstration by the London unemployed to welcome their comrades from North, South, East and West.&quot;The London comrades have been busy making arrangements to house and feed the marchers during thoir ctay in London.   Large halls have been taken for them to stay in, and great efforts are being made to show appreciation&apos;of the courage of the marchers in as material a way as possible.&quot;On Sunday, November 10th, a mass demonstration will be held in Trafalgar Square,  and, the unemployed from all parts of London will march to the Square and there put &quot;forward the demands of the unemployed for work or full maintenance at trade union rates.&quot;A conference of all the contingents and London members will be hold on Monday, November SOth, to decide their future activities and the coming interview with the Prime Minister.    They would like the Prime Minister to meet them at the conference, but there is little likelihood that he would do this.&quot;The main purpose of the deputation, which the conference will appoint, is to show to the workers and the Government the desperate plight of the unemployed and the spirit which is filling them.On/- IS -

It is reported,    on the authority of a single informant that the organised unemployed in Canning Town are arming themselves with short sticks &quot;to protect themselves on November 22nd.nOn Armistice day about 1,000 women and children assembled ok the Embankment and marched to the Cenotaph where wreaths were placed:    the demonstration was perfectly orderly: some of the women and children were conveyed in dust-carts belonging to the Battc-rsea Borough Council and others in horse-carts and steam lorries belonging to the Poplar Borough Council.IRISH^KB.V0LUTI0NAHY ACgIVITJ.ES IN CLEAT BRITAINThe Irish have been so busy in connection with the General Election during the we ok that thore has been little time for other activities.Mrs. Barrett is reported to be going to Lublin this we^k with a message from Art 0&apos;Bricn In which he says that there is a warrant for hie arrest with the police.

This organisation is not to be associated with any political party and exists for the study of the Gaelic languages, games, etc. The objects of this new organisation are somewhat on the lines of the Gaelic League and those who know that organisation and the part it took in recruiting for the Irish Republican Irsry fear that the new organisation, if it ever comes to anything, will   eventually follow in the same footsteps.Before the S.S. &quot;Ardmorcbelonging to the City of Cork steamship company,sailed from Liverpool for Cork on November loth, 1,200 rounds of ammunition were found concealed amongst hay.A Republican Convention was held at 171, Renfield Street, Glasgow, on November   11th with Eamon Donnelly, Secretary to do valera and Director of organisation in Ireland, in the chair.
