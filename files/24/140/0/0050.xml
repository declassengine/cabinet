In connection with the Report of the Indian Military Requirements Committee, circulated as CP. 4810, I desire to invite the attention of my colleagues to the accompanying papers relating to a proposal to grant artillery to the troops of Indian Native States. My reason for bringing this matter before the Cabinet is partly that there is some divergence of opinion as between my advisers and the Government of India, but mainly that the acceptance of the Government of India&apos;s proposal must raise the larger issue of equipping the Indian Army (consisting of Indian troops) with similar artillery, which it does not now possess. I propose therefore to raise this question when the&apos; Report of the Indian Military Requirements Committee is discussed by the CabinetThe papers circulated are (1) the despatch which I have received from the Government of India on the subject; (2) a memorandum forwarded to me privately by the Viceroy on the general reorganisation of the Indian State Forces, showing its relation to the artillery proposal; (3; a draft which had been prepared for my consideration, giving reasons why the Government of India&apos;s proposals should not be accepted.In regard to No. (3) I do not wish, at any rate at the present stage, to commit, myself to the views therein expressed ; I circulate it as giving in a convenient form the arguments that can be staled against the Government of India&apos;s proposal.1 think it desirable to draw attention to the statement, and its development, in No. (2) to the effect that &quot;it would perhaps have been better if a fuller justification had been attempted [in the Government of Indians despatch, document No. (1)] in ATiew ot the two important facts : &quot; (1) that the whole doctrine of the &apos; ratio &apos;* was based on the assumption that the control of the artillery would remain in British hands ; and&quot; (2) that the grant of artillery to States was a departure from the cardinal feature of the scheme! which was similarity of armament between the State units and the units of the Indian Armv.&quot;PEEL.6th December 1922.* i.e., the ratio of British to Indian troops in India, now fixed at 1 British to 2&apos;41 Indians.t i,e., the scheme for reorganisation of the Indian State Forces, discussed in the Memorandum.(10,   -Letter from Government of India, No. 54, Foreign and Political, to Secretary of Statefor India, dated 14th July J921.Sir,We have the honour to address you on the subject of the supply of guns and artillery equipment to Indian States, to which brief allusion was made in para. .1.2 of our Despatch No. 62, dated the 24th June 1920, regarding certain proposals for the reorganisation of the Imperial Service Troops.2. In response to the invitation to the Ruling Princes to intimate the approximate number of troops they desire to maintain in such a condition as regards equipment and training as to be fit for active service, certain States, notably Bikaner, Patiala, In do re. Gwalior and Bharatpur, have already expressed themselves as desirous of maintaining artillery of modern pattern, and it is anticipated that a similar desire will be evinced by the Barbara of Rampur, Hyderabad and Mysore, as well as Baroda, should His Highness the Maharaja Gaekwar eventually decide to participate in the reorganisation scheme. In view of these aspirations, we are of opinion that the time has arrived for a careful consideration of the question.3. In dealing with the requests of Darbars for the supply of guns, we have hitherto generally adhered to the principle laid down in para. 4 of Lord Cross&apos;s-Political Despatch No. 28, dated the 30th April 1891, and&apos; have limited the supply to smooth-bore gnus in numbers not exceeding reasonable requirements for saluting purposes.    The only important departure from this principle  has been in the printed for the Cabinet.       December 1922.SECRET.CP. 1350.CABINET.
exceptional case of the Kashmir mountain Latteries, and was justified by the importance of rendering them thoroughly efficient for service on the Kashmir frontier.4. Although the invitation to the States contemplated consideration hy them of the number of troops they could maintain similar as regards arms and equipment to the various units of the Indian Army, we consider that, consistently with the policy of complete trust, which is the basis of the reorganisation proposals, there is no sufficient justification for refusing to entertain suggestions by States for the main-tenance of units of Horse, or Field or Pack Artillery, where it can be shown that such units are intended to he complementary to those of other arms, and with them will form a concrete fighting force, to be maintained in a high state of efficiency as regards organisation, training and equipment.o. We propose, therefore, subject to your approval, to consider all such appli-cations for the formation of Artillery units on their merits, and, in approved cases, to grant on loan to Darbars 13-pr. or 15-pr. or 2&apos;75-inch guns, as may be most suitable ; the proportion of artillery to other arms not to exceed the proportion adopted in the regular army. The supply of ammunition for these guns would be retained in our hands, and would be limited to a fixed quantity for each gun. We are convinced that the measure of trust implied by the loan of these guns will be most gratifying to the Darbars, and will be fully justified should an - emergency arise necessitating the co-operation of the State forces with troops of the regular army, in which contingency the State Artillery units would form useful adjuncts to our Artillery.We have, &amp;c.,READING, &amp;c.     &amp;c.(2.)Memorandum on the Reorganisation of the Indian State Forces.1. The main object of the reorganisation was the attainment of greater efficiency -by the removal of delects which had become apparent during the war.The main, defect (apart from inadequate training of officers and men) was that the Imperial Service Troops were not as organised on the same plan as ours. When required to work with our troops, consequently, the State units did not fit into the places they were to occupy in the way that one of our own units would have done. They were in a sense round pegs where square pegs were wanted and vice versa.2. The new scheme was much more comprehensive than  the  old one.    It -embraced not only the first line troops, but also the irregular troops and the State police.   The irregular troops were to be armed and organised in such a way as to transform them into an efficient reserve, while the police were to be given suitable weapons to enable them to cope with dacoits.3. The justification for a reserve was obvious, while it was difficult to defend a policy which restricted the State police to an armament inferior to that of the criminals with whom they had to deal.4. The despatch of the 24-th June 1920, in which the main reorganisation pro-posals were submitted to the Secretary of State, did not discuss in detail all the pros -and cons of the scheme. It did, however, suggest answers to possible criticisms based on (1) the effect of the proposal on the &quot; ratio &quot; ; and(2) the traditional view as to the undesirability of giving State troops a full up-to-date armament.As regards (1), the despatch pointed out that the addition to the strength of the State troops involved in the proposals was so small that it had no practical effect on the &quot; ratio.&quot;As regards (2), it was urged (1) that it would be a mistake to deprive ourselves of the benefit of the experience of Lewis guns, &amp;c , that the State troops had gained daring the war ;(2) that it was unreasonable to withdraw such guns from them as soon as peace was restored ; and(3) that if the Government of India was to get the full benefit of the scheme, a complete similarity of armament, as between State troops and British Indian troops, was essential.
Finally, great stress was laid on the importance of. inaugurating a more liberal policy and placing complete confidence in the Princes and Chiefs.5. The Secretary of State replied in his despatch of the 18th November 1920. He accepted the proposals of the Government of India and. expressed full concurrence with the view that a policy of trust was imperative in our dealings with the Indian States. As regards the &quot; ratio,&quot; he agreed that the new scheme was not likely to affect materially the existing &quot; ratio,&quot; but added that if the numbers should hereafter become unexpectedly great, it would be for the Government of India to consider what steps, if any, should be taken to deal with the situation thus created.0. Artillery. In their despatch of the 14th July 1921 the Government of India submitted their proposals in regard to artillery. They reported that it was anticipated that some eight or nine States would desire to maintain, artillery of modern pattern,, and they stated their proposals and the justification for them in paras. 4 and 5 of the despatch, which ran as follows :  &quot;4. Although the invitation to the States contemplated consideration by them of the number of troops they could maintain similar as regards arms and equipment to the various units of the Indian Army, we consider that, consistently with the policy of complete trust which is the basis of the reorganisation proposals, there is no-sufficient justification for refusing to entertain suggestions by States for the main-tenanee of units of Horse or Field or Pack Artillery, where it can be shown that such units are intended to be complementary to those of other arms and with them will form a concrete fighting force to be maintained in a high state of efficiency as regards organisation, training and equipment.&quot;5. We propose, therefore, subject to your approval, to consider all such applications for the formation of artillery units on their merits, and, in approved cases, to grant on loan, to Durbars 13-pr. or 15-pr. or 2 &quot;75-inch guns, as maybe most suitable ; the proportion of artillery to other arms not to exceed the proportion adopted in the regular army. The supply of ammunition for these guns would be retained in our hands and would be limited to a fixed quantity for each gun. We are convinced that the measure of trust implied by the loan of these guns will be most gratifying to the Durbars and will be fully justified should an emergency arise necessitating the co-operation of the State Forces with troops of the regular army, in which contingency the State Artillery units would form useful adjuncts to our artillery.&quot; The case for the new departure was not argued in detail. It was made-to rest, mainly on the new policy of trust, though reference-was made to certain safeguards which would limit the risks.It would perhaps have been better if a fuller justification had been attempted in view of the two important facts  (I) that the whole doctrine of the &quot;ratio&quot; was based on the assumption that the coutrol of the artillery would remain in British hands ; and(2) that the grant of artillery to States was a departure from the cardinal feature of the scheme which was similarity ol; armament between the State units and the units of the Indian A-rmy.7. Motor Machine Gun. Batteries. The circumstances under which the Govern-ment. of India asked for the approval of the Secretary of State to the supply of Motor Machine Gun Batteries to Durbars are explained in Foreign and Political Departments telegram of the 8th March ] 922. The Government of India had already committed themselves and, as the principle of allowing automatic weapons to Indian State troops had been conceded, it was considered that the States might be permitted, to maintain Motor Batteries of such weapons.8. The object of the scheme is improved efficiency, and it is clear that by increasing the efficiency of the State Forces we increase their potentialities for evil as well as for good. The Secretary of State has expressed&apos; anxiety about the risks involved, and it may perhaps be admitted that in our despatches we have laid more stress on the policy of trust than on the solid advantages both to us and to the States-ol: allowing them to strengthen their military forces to a reasonable extent.9. The risks may be considered first.   They may bs summed up as follows : (a) the disturbance of the ratio ;(b) the spread of disloyalty or Bolshevism among the State troops ; and(c) the special risks attending the grant of artillery.
10. The Government&apos; of India have already stated that the ratio will not be seriously disturbed.    Figures are given below in support of this statement: The number of first line troops in the States (including transport personnel) on 1st April 1914 was 23,000 ; on 1st April 1922 it was 21,000.We are not yet in a position to forecast more than very roughly the number under the new scheme, as very few States have formally submitted their proposals. The Military Adviser-in-Chief has visited practically all the States which are likely to come under the scheme and has discussed possibilities with the Durbars. If every unit they have spoken of comes into existence, there would apparently be a maximum increase of about 20 per cent, in the cavalry and 80 per cent, in the infantry. There are a few important Statesf which are still hesitating Baroda, Indore, Rewa and Udaipur, but they are none of them States which have shown much interest in the Imperial Service movement in the past, and it will probably be safe to allow for actual increases amounting to about half the maxima indicated above.In calculating the ratio it is customary to exclude from the account so far as State troops (Imperial Service troops) are concerned (1) non-fighting units ; (2) artillery ;(3) the troops of Kashmir and Rajputana. The Kashmir troops are excluded because of their isolation, and the Rajput troops because they are supposed to be more under the control of their own Princes than the &quot; mercenaries &quot; maintained by the other States.The authorised and actual strengths of the different arms in the Imperial Service Troops on 1st April 1922 were approximately as follows :  	Aii fcli orisecl.	Actual.	Estimated.Artillery Cavalry Infantry Camel Corps Sappers Transport	600 - 7,700 - 10,900 700 700 - 2,400	000 6,700 10,200 700 600 2,100	2,040f 8,500 ] 5,260 900 1,600 2,000Total	-   23,000	20,900	30,300In the last column we give the best estimate we can form of the strength of the different arms under the new7 system. In addition, there may be about 10 sections of machine guns mounted on light Ford cars, with a total personnel of about 270 men, allowing nine per gun.We are now in a position to show the effect of the organisation on the ratio. The figures supplied by the Army Department are based on the Budget figures of 1921-22,J modified so as to include new services (the Royal Air Force, educational establishment and mechanical transport). They show British personnel 63,843 and Indian personnel 154,110, giving a ratio of 1 : 2 &quot;41. The Indian personnel includes a total of 13,208 on account of Indian State troops, after making the customary deductions referred to above. Making similar deductions from the estimated total of 30,300, we must substitute a total of 17,560 for the previous total of 13,208, which will raise the ratio to just, over 1 ; 2&quot; 48. The extra 270 men required for the light Ford motor machine gun sections will raise it again to just under I. : 2&apos;50.The local troops of the States have not up to the present been included in calculating the ratio, but if 50 per cent, of the units the States have talked about materialise as working reserves, we should perhaps add some 6,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, but even so the ratio will still be under 1 : 2&apos;60.These figures seem to the Government of India to show pretty conclusively that so far as the traditional ratio of personnel is concerned, there is no cause for anxiety, but it will not be forgotten that the Military Requirements Committee has made recommendations with regard to the ratio as a gauge of safety.* Nabha too lias not yet indicated his intentions.I        the existing Kashmir batteries plus 10 new 4-gun batteries.X The figures for 1922-23 are not at pi&apos;eseiit available in tabulated form, but the General Staff Branch report that they hardly differ from those for the preceding year, and that the recent reduction -will not affect the ratio.
11. It is hardly necessary to deal separately with the second of the risks specified above. Our ultimate insurance against the effects of sedition and Bolshevism lies in the maintenance of a proper proportion&apos; of troops upon whom we can rely in any emergency. At the same time, if may justly be claimed that there is no more loyal class in India than the Ruling Princes and Chiefs. They are bound to the British Government by self-interest if by nothing else, while Bolshevism is radically opposed to the autocracy for which they stand. During the Mutiny not a single Chief of importance took part against us, aud Lord Canning&apos;s remarks as to the value of the States to us during that period are well known and often quoted. The improvement of the State troops increases the power of the Rulers to deal with sedition, and to that extent diminishes the chance of their troops becoming disaffected.12. The special risks connected with artillery deserve careful consideration. The doctrine of the ratio has always rested on the assumption that the artillery would be in British hands, and the present proposals are admittedly a new departure. It is, moreover, a departure which has no relation to the main object of the reorganisation scheme, viz., the urgent need for uniformity of organisation between the units of the Indian Army and those of the State forces which are intended to co-operate with them. The proposals in regard to artillery muse consequently be justified indepen-denfly of the general scheme.It is recognised that they are open to certain criticisms.In the first place, we cannot well allow the States to have modern artillery unless we are prepared to allow artillery in the Indian Army.Secondly, the States want artillery mainly as a mark of dignity. The artillery, if left to them, will probably he both expensive and inefficient. Funds will he diverted from the more useful arms, cavalry and infantry, and wo shall be encouraging the States to waste money on troops which are useless except for purposes of show, which is just what we want to avoid.It, is further possible that, the grant of artillery to a few of the largest States may cause apprehension to other States, but up to the present there have been ho signs of any such feeling on the part of those States -which will not qualify for artillery.Thirdly, the grant of artillery to States may put a new and dangerous weapon in the hands of the disaffected.As regards the first of the above criticisms, the question of creating Indian Artillery in our own Army will have to be faced. If we are to fit India for self-government within a. reasonable period, we cannot maintain our present position very much longer.The second criticism no doubt has a good deal in it, though it hardly amounts to a risk. But the basis of the proposals is efficiency, and if the concession is to be made, we must have some guarantee that the units will he efficient. This disposes of the spcond objection and we pass on to the third.Efficiency will no doubt increase the risks in some respects. So much is admitted, but it is an argument which applies to all improvements in the State troops.. It is, moreover, a double-edged argument, as if efficiency increaf.es risks, it increases-utility too. The fact is that risks must be faced. We shall have to give artillery to the Indian Army before long, and we cannot refuse it to the States. The mark of confidence in the Princes will be deeply appreciated, not only by those primarily concerned, but by a great number of others as well, and the British Government will acquire, if the proper conditions are observed, some useful auxiliary units. Our task should be to ensure the acceptance and observance of those conditions, and this we are now in a position to do. A reference to para. 3 of the Despatch of 24th June 1920 will show that consideration of the two important subjects of &quot;discipline &quot; and &quot; system of command in war &quot; has been postponed even in regard to the cavalry and infantry, &amp;c. What is now suggested, is that the Government of India should be permitted to proceed with their proposals in regard to artillery when a satisfactory arrangement has been arrived at in regard to these two points, and also in regard to the system of training. The Commander-in-Chief is of opinion that the arrangements in question should include provision (so far as the artillery at any rate is concerned) for the appointment of European officers to command in war, where necessary.13. As regards motor machine gun batteries, the proposal would be more accurately described as one for light Ford car machine gun sections. , There would be three guns in each section with a personnel of about nine per gun.The Secretary of State has already agreed to the arming of State troops with machine guns, and the further concession proposed is a very slight advance on what has already been sanctioned. There is nothing to prevent the State military autho-5929 A 3
rities in lime of emergency from putting their machine guns into light cars and running them out to the scene of action. All the proposal really amounts&apos;to is that the Stales concerned should be given a few machine guns in excess of the complement required for their cavalry and infantry units. The Government of India see no objection to allowing the same State to have artillery as well as these light car -sections, and, with reference to the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram, of 8th June, it may &quot;be pointed out that the supply of machine guns to the infantry is an essential feature of the reorganisation scheme, as without it the State infantry could not take their place in the fighting line alongside our own.It is hardly necessary to dwell on the value of these light car units for proposes of internal security. The States are now undertaking more extensive responsibilities in connection with internal security, and their duties will extend to the protection of strategic lines where these exist. The car units will be valuable alike for patrolling and for the rapid concentration of force at a particular point.14. The effect of the proposals on the considerations which may be summed up in the single term &quot; the ratio &quot; has not been reduced to terms of arithmetic, because, as we have said, it has been proposed that the &quot;ratio &quot; should be abandoned, but we have (so we claim) justified our proposals on other grounds.We have spoken of our new policy as one of trust. But it is and must be a policy of trust with limitations. We retain the supply of arms and ammunition in our own hands. We do not suggest that we should permit the States to have tanks or armoured cars or heavy artillery, and we should not permit them to set up factories for the production of high explosives. The Rulers of Slates for the most part under-stand these limitations as well as we do, and will in their hearts be grateful for the evidences of increased trust that we are showing them.15. In conclusion the Government of India desire to explain briefly their general policy in regard to the military forces of Indian States. They consider that a liberal policy in this matter will be advantageous both to them and to the States.The advantages to the Government of India are three-fold. financial, military, and political.We gain financially, because, if the States can maintain order within their territories, and can supply us with efficient troops for Imperial defence, we can reduce the number of troops we have to employ ourselves.We gain from the military point of view, as we obtain, a valuable reserve of strength for emergencies, and we are less likely to be called on to send out small detachments to maintain order in the States. We receive assistance, moreover, in the maintenance of order in British India. The States have given us most valuable help in this direction on several occasions in recent years. During the disturbances of 1919 the Punjab States provided troops for the protection of the railway lines which in several parts of the province &quot;were torn up by the insurgents. Bast cold weather the JVJaharaja of Alwar rushed out some of his troops to the assistance of some British Indian officials who were besieged at Firozpur Jhirka in Gurgaon District in the Punjab, and the Maharaj liana of Dholpur rendered some assistance at Aligarh. These were all cases of assistance rendered in British territory or along British railway lines, but during the Bhil troubles a few weeks ago the Jodhpur troops co-operated in the restoration of order in Mewar.Politically we gain, because when the States are strong there is less risk of serious agitation within their borders, and agitation may always react on British India If there are disturbances in the States, and the Durbars can suppress them without our assistance, we avoid the odium of having to interfere.The advantages to the States themselves are both moral and material.They gain morally, because heir dignity is raised in the eyes of their subjects and of the outside world, if it is known that they can deal with disorder themselves. They gain materially, because they are better able to maintain order in the event of .serioiis agitation and disturbance.(3.)Draft of a Despatch in rcpuj to the Government of India1.? Despatch of the 14i/i July 1921, prepared for consideration.My Lord,I have received your despatch in the Foreign and Political Department, No. 54, Internal, dated the 14th July 192J, in which you propose that, subject to certain conditions, you should in approved cases grant on loan to Darbars guns of
modern pattern, to enable them to maintain units of Horse, Field, or Pack Artillery as -&quot;Component parts of their reorganised State forces. .2. I regret that, after the fullest consideration of the very important questions involved, I find myself unable to approve your proposals. In order to set before you : as fully as possible the reasons for this decision, it is necessary that I should take a somewhat broad survey and touch on some aspects of the matter that were not mentioned in your despatch, and may not therefore have presented themselves in their full significance to the minds of your Government.3. The measures you propose involve, as I need not point out, a departure from what has for long been considered a vital and fundamental axiom of military policy in India, viz., that field artillery should be retained wholly in British hands. They obviously call for the most careful consideration, and they must, as it appears to me, be considered in three main aspects : firstly, the immediate and purely military, as measures for increasing the value of the State forces for the purposes for which these forces are, or should be, maintained ; secondly, and more broadly, in their bearing on the relations and inter-relations, present and future, between the paramount British Power, the Governments and peoples of the provinces of British India, and the Governments and peoples of the Indian States; and thirdly, in their relation to the course of world policy in regard to armaments and expenditure on armaments.4. To deal first with the purely military aspect, your proposals, if they are to have the military advantage attributed to them, necessarily involve the assumption that the State artillery units would, in common wdth other State forces, always be highly efficient, and would in an emergency form useful adjuncts to the artillery of the regular army. It seems to me impossible that field artillery forming part of the State forces could be used in conjunction with regular artillery unless it were equipped with similar armament and trained and commanded by artillery officers of the same degree of efficiency as British regular officers. There is no prospect of the Indian States possessing such trained officers in the near future, while it is well known that the States are averse to utilising the services of British military officers in executive positions. It cannot therefore be anticipated that, if your recommendations were approved, the artillery, which is an arm requiring a high degree of technical training and skilled supervision in action, would, in the forces of the Indian States, be even as efficient as their cavalry and infantry. The States artillery would therefore, in my opinion, be of no real value for the purposes cf military operations in co-operation with the regular army, and it can hardly be suggested that artillery is required for the purpose of maintaining order within the States. If other ways in which Rulers of Indian States might employ artillery are conceivable, they are not such as could be contemplated with approval by the paramount Power. I conclude, then, that if the question be regarded merely as -one of adding to the value of the State forces for legitimate military purposes, little advantage could be expected from the adoption of your proposals.5. This, however, it may be said, is not a positive objection; and I should not be influenced by it if in other respects the balance of advantage were in favour of your proposal. I recognise that it was to broadly political rather than to purely military advantages that you looked in formulating your proposals, the principal reasons underlying them being, as I understand, those indicated in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of your Despatch, viz., that a policy of complete trust is the.basis of the proposals for the reorganisation of the Imperial Service Troops, and that the evidence of trust implied by the loan of guns would be most gratifying to the Darbars. These considerations belong to what I have described above as the second aspect of your proposals, to which I now turn. If all relevant factors are given due weight, is it indeed clear that the balance of advantage in this sphere is on the side of your proposals? The argument on the point of trust in the Indian Rulers that you put forward, weighty though it is, really touches only one among the many questions that suggest themselves wdien your proposals are considered in relation to the complex and difficult subject of the future inter-relations of the paramount Power, the British provinces and the Indian States. This is not the place, and perhaps the time has not yet come, to enter upon any detailed discussion of these questions ; but I desire briefly to draw your attention to some considerations that cannot, it seems to me, be disregarded.0. 1 fully appreciate the weight of your argument on the point of trust, but I -cannot regard it as conclusive in the present instance.   I entirely agree in the view
expressed in ray predecessor&apos;s Despatch No. 16, Secret, of the 18th November 1920,. that a policy of trust is imperative in our dealings with the Indian States. Bat trust should be mutual, and should, on the side of the Indian Rulers, include recognition of the necessary retention by the paramount Power of the right and duty of setting limits to the military equipment of Indian States, individually or collectively, without any implication of distrust, where it considers this necessary from the point/of view of the interests of India.as a whole, of which it can alone be the judge. Some such reservation is indeed implicit in your proposals, which do not carry trust to the length of providing Indian States with the most modern guns or with unlimited ammunition. And if limits are to be set, it seems to me very questionable whether it would not be more conducive in the Jong run to good relations with the Indian Rulers, if not indeed easier also in the first instance, to take a stand at the outset on the broad principle that it is unnecessary and undesirable to supply the State forces with artillery, rather than to draw the line, and to keep it drawn (as I assume you would wish to keep it), at the point proposed in your Despatch. I therefore regard your argument under this head with some doubt.7. There are other considerations that appear to me definitely to turn the scale against your proposal. In the first place, the present question is in my view Jar less that of trusting the; Ruling Princes and Chiefs -although the risk of loyalty being, undermined, in individual cases, cannot be altogether ignored than that of trusting their troops. Instances have not been, wanting in the past of the Chiefs themselves being unable to control disloyal or mutinous troops. In times of internal disorder, or widespread fanatical or revolutionary movements, it might easily be -that- Princes of the most unblemished loyalty would again find themselves in this predicament. Even if it be assumed that the State forces are composed in the main of subjects of the respective Rulers by whom they are maintained, it must be remembered that the Princes and their people are not always of the same race or religion. In this connection I may call Tour Excellency&apos;s attention to the remark in your Finance Department telegram No. 201-F. of the 18th January 1921, that, while the Ruling Chiefs undoubtedly realised the importance to themselves of preventing the spread of Bolshevism there was no guarantee that a similar spirit would always prevail among their subjects. In the event of a Ruler&apos;s forces passing beyond his control, the fact, that they were armed with modern guns (however inefficiently these might be handled from the point of view expressed in para. 4 of this Despatch) might become a serious additional danger to himself and a source of embarrassment to the Govern--ment of India. While therefore the States Artillery would be unlikely to add greatly to the safeguards against internal disturbances, they might nevertheless contribute a very undesirable addition to the forces of disorder.8. A difficulty even more weighty, so far as field artillery is concerned, is that this arm forms no part at present of the Indian Army. The addition of field artillery units to the State forces would almost inevitably raise the question of a similar-addition to the Indian Army, and so long as this is held to be inadvisable very strong-reason exists for applying the same restriction to State forces. Differential treatment might easily give rise to discussions in the Legislature and in the Press which,&apos; apart from raising topics undesirable in themselves, might in the end compel, the Govern-ment of India to -make definite public pronouncements on questions which they would find it very embarrassing to deal with in this way. and perhaps even to introduce,, under political pressure, changes to which, their own judgment did not assent.9. Closely connected with this aspect of the matter is the bearing of your proposals on the question of the ratio between British and Indian troops. 1 need not here pursue this quest-ion further than to remark that any departure from the policy of keeping field artillery wholly in British hands would in itself, irrespective of the number of personnel concerned, wholly upset the basis upon which the ratio at present rests.10. The problems of the future relations of British. India with the Indian States,, and of the Indian States one with another, I will not discuss here. But my present feeling is, that if it were decided hereafter to abandon the principle of keeping field artillery in British hands the regular Indian Army should receive the addition of artillery units before the State forces, and that it would not even then necessarily follow that the State forces should include field artillery. From the point of view of tire-relations of States one with another, the possibilities of future danger involved in unnecessary additions to, and competition in, military equipment, are obvious.
11. The above considerations are reinforced by those arising on what I have indicated above as the third, and broadest, aspect of the matter. The whole trend of enlightened world opinion is now in the direction of the reduction of armaments. Financial difficulties, in India as elsewhere, are compelling action in the same direction. I do not wish to lay undue stress on these considerations, but it would be something of an anomaly, and might even become a ground of international criticism, to embark at this time on the creation of a new and exjjensive addition to the military forces of India.12. After considering your proposals in all their aspects, I am, as I have already stated, clearly of opinion that the objections I have indicated outweigh the arguments in their favour. At the same time, I feel strongly the undesirability of leaving the Princes and Chiefs concerned under the impression that the decision is due to lack of trust in them, and I hope you will make every effort to avoid this. The matter is, of course, a delicate one, but I trust to Your Excellency to explain confidentially to the Princes and Chiefs, as far as you may consider advisable, the reasons for not arming their forces with modern artillery.13. J have also considered the proposal put forward in your telegram, No. 301 S., of the 7th March last, that Indian States should be allowed to maintain motor machine-gun batteries as part of their State forces. The objections set forth above to the maintenance of artillery units do not apply in their entirety to this proposal, and 1 recognise that the addition of machine-gun batteries may, unlike the addition of artillery, be represented as a reasonable measure which would really strengthen the State forces for the performance of one of their legitimate functions, namely, that of dealing with internal disorder. At the same time I do not feel that it is necessary or desirable at the present time to agree to this further increase of the armaments of the State forces, in addition to the large number of machine and Lewis guns covered, by the sanction conveyed in my predecessors Despatch No. 16, Secret, of the 18th November 1920, especially as the equipment of the Indian Army in these respects is not yet complete.   I regret, therefore, that I am unable to approve this proposal.11. I have learned with regret that, as reported in your telegram, you have -already circulated to Darbars a list of units to be -maintained by States under the reorganisation scheme in which motor machine-gun batteries are included, but I do not feel that your action should preclude me from giving a decision on the merits of the proposal. If any Darbars have expressed a wish to maintain such batteries, I hope that you may be able to prevent their being left with any sense of grievance. :I trust that no similar steps have been taken, in regard to the cmestion of artillery. I should greatly regret to find that premature discussion or the holding out of tmauthorised expectations had caused the disappointment which must inevitably result in some quarters from my decision to be more acute or more widely spread than it need have been if due caution had been observed.
