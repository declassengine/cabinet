[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma,iesty&apos;s Government. 1      j j printed for the Cabinet.   November 1922.SECRET.CP. 4318.CABINET.THE MURDERS AT CORK AND MACROOM.Memorandum by the Secretary op State for the Colonies.THE attached letter, which I circulate for the information of my colleagues, relates primarily to Lieutenant Genochio, who was murdered in Cork, and to the three British officers who were murdered at Macroom. I drew Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s attention to the fact that my predecessor had caused an enquiry to be held into the death of certain Catholics at Cushendall alleged by Mr. Devlin to have been murdered by Ulster Specials, and pressed for a similar enquiry into these murders of British officers. Mr. Cosgrave replied that, while unquestionably these murders were perpetrated by Irregulars in rebellion against the authority of the Free State, his Government must consider itself bound to make such reparation as was possible for these flagrant and treacherous breaches of the truce. He could hold out no hope that an enquiry would lead to any tangible results, and, while feeling that no payment of damages could in any way compensate the bereaved parents for their loss, could think of no other form in which reparation could be offered.After further consideration he suggested the extension of the principle to the cases of all servants of the Crown (i.e., officers and members of the Royal Irish Constabulary) maliciously injured since the truce, provided that the British Government were prepared to deal in the same way with any outrages committed by servants of the Crown in violation of the truce. There are, as a matter of fact, one or two instances in which such outrages appear to have happened. After discussing these proposals with his colleagues in Dublin, he has written this letter on behalf of the Provisional Government.His Government is faced with conditions similar to those which the British Government was facing before the truce, when public enquiries into murders were not attempted and would have been useless. I am therefore disposed to agree that at the present time compensation is the only way in which reparation for crimes committed in breach of the ti*uce can be made. This frank acknowledgment of the detestable character of these crimes may be some comfort to the parents of the murdered officers, and I propose to send them copies of Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s letter, unless my colleagues inform me of any objection to that course.(Signed) DEVONSHIRE.Colonial Office, November 22, 1922.Rialtas Sealadach na Heireann(Irish Provisional Government), Your Grace, Baile Atha Cliath, November 19, 1922.We have had under consideration the matter of personal injuries, in some cases resulting in death, suffered by members of the British forces within the area of our jurisdiction since the 11th July, 1921, and which amount to breaches of the truce entered into on that date.In the first place I have to place on record my Government&apos;s detestation of these crimes and the deep sympathy of every one of its members with the sufferers and with the relatives of those who lost their lives.   I feel sure that your[9121]
Government views with equal abhorrence breaches of the same truce committed by its servants. It is pitiable that the opening of a new chapter in the relations of our two peoples should have been marred by such occurrences, and that hands on both sides, which had better have been turned to a noble task, were found to forge still more links of private grief into the chain of sorrow and tragedy in these relations. All our efforts to trace the perpetrators on our side of these crimes have failed up to the present. In all the circumstances of the time we have felt compelled to reject as impracticable the holding of any immediate enquiry into the circumstances of the individual cases. &quot;We do not, however, intend to lose sight of the matter, and when we discover, as we shall strive to discover, the persons responsible, it is our determination to bring them to justice.We have considered the question of compensation in the cases for which it appears that our nationals were responsible. We have decided that, the other parties being willing, the best way of assessing the compensation which we propose to pay is to submit the cases to Messrs. Howell, Thomas and Dowdall (members of Lord Shaw&apos;s Commission nominated by the two Governments), and (if this course be approved) to request them to enquire into the facts and to submit recommendations as to the amounts which ought to be paid.Very faithfully yours, (Signed) LI AM T. MACGOSGAIR.
