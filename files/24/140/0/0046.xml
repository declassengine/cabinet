PROPOSED LEGISLATION IN INDIA TO AMEND THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AFFECTING THE TRIAL OF EUROPEANS.I HAVE read the memorandum by the Secretary of State for India, CP. 4320. As Lord Peel says, item 6 on p. 3 is of interest to the Colonial Office. I find that the question involved was considered by the Cabinet Committee appointed by the late Government to which Lord Peel refers in the last paragraph of his memorandum. This committee, at a meeting held on the 28th August, 1922, considered the proposed amendments in the definition of &quot; European British subject,&quot; and arrived at the following conclusions: &quot; That the proposals of the Government of India on this point cannot be accepted, but that in view of the obvious necessity for amending the existing definition, it might provide a satisfactory solution to adopt the phrase &apos; a British subject of European origin,&apos; or, if this is unduly indefinite, the definition adopted by the Joint Select Committee for the purpose of the electoral rules.&quot;I concur in the general conclusion of the Cabinet Committee and also in its first suggestion. I should also be prepared to accept the second suggestion, on the understanding that the words &quot; resident in British India &quot; in the definition adopted by the Joint Select Committee for the purpose of the electoral rules (set out on p. 6 of P.L.I. 3), would include persons temporarily visiting the country.Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1922.SECRET.C P. 4346.CABINET.(Signed) DEVONSHIREColonial Office,December    , 1922.[9184]
