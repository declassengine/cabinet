Claims by the Government of India in respect of Indian Expeditionary Force Transactions brought to account through their War Stores Suspense Account.In the winter of 1920-21 discussion took place in the Cabinet on a claim by the Government of India for an advance subject to adjustment of 10,000,0007,. from the War Office in respect of certain expenditure during the war brought to account partly through their War Stores Suspense Account. Exception was taken to this claim by the War Office on the ground that they had agreed from the beginning of the war to make advances to the Government of India pari passu with the disburse-in ent by that Government of recoverable expenditure, that they had regularly made such advances to the full extent of the estimates submitted by India, and that the claim for 10,000,0007. was belated and quite unexpectedly large.My predecessor pointed, out. I understand, that the claim in respect of the War Stores Suspense Account had been foreshadowed by the Government of India in December 1919, and that there were two reasons for the delay in its presentation, viz. : (.1) that the process of clearing up the War Stores Suspense Account, a compli-cated and difficult matter in itself, had been much hindered by the Afghan and frontier operations (a purely Indian liability), which had occupied the attention of the military authorities in India and complicated the work of disentangling Imperial and Indian liabilities in connection with the stores provided for war purposes and charged to the War Stores Suspense Account, and (2) that until the position had been fully examined and cleared up the Government of India had not wished to raise any further claims in the matter against the War Office.It was finally agreed in the Cabinet that the desired advance should be made, on the understanding that the claim should be subject to- careful scrutiny, and provision for the advance was accordingly made in the Supplementary Estimates of the War Office for 1920-21.The item evoked unfavourable comment from Mr. Asquith in the discussion on the Estimates, on 20th December 1920, but the Estimates were carried after a speech by the Prime Minister, during which he made the following remarks in regard to the claim by the GoArernment of India : &quot; With regard to the 10,000,0007. that is a bargain which was entered into by the Government of my right hon. Friend (Mr. Asquith) in 1914 with India. I was a Member of that Government, but I think if we were to enter into that bargain at the present moment it would be rather a different kind of bargain. It was one of those bargains we had to make under the pressure of war, when there was not very much time, hut it was not the best bargain for the British taxpayer. It was a bargain whereby all stores over and above what were normally required for the Indian Army should&apos; be paid for by the British taxpayer. My recollection is, that India was practically to send in the bill, and as there was no means of investigating it by means of a system- of 593!)      100   12.22Printed for the Cabinet.

The&apos; correspondence shows that the circulation of the Memorandum was under discussion between the late Secretary of State for War and myself last summer; but owing to difficulties still felt by the former, I did not proceed with the matter. Since then I have been in communication with the present Secretary.of State for War, who has expressed his concurrence.PEEL.12th December 1922.
accountancy here, we were to accept the accounts sent in from India.   That is not a very satisfactory arrangement.   This claim was only sent in shortly before this Supplementary Estimate was put in.   It is in respect of expenditure claimed to have been incurred by the Indian Army for Mesopotamia, Palestine, Egypt and perhaps Constantinople.   (Mr. Bonar Law : &quot;Everywhere.&apos;)   Every-where.   We have not had an opportunity of investigating that claim at present. It only came in shortly before these Estimates were prepared.   We thought it right to inform the House and take full authority to deal with it, but that, does not mean we shall not look into the account and see what is fairly attributable to the British taxpayer and what ought to be paid by the Indian taxpayer. But we were bound to inform the House immediately the account came in, and claim the authority of the House to deal with it.&quot; The bargain referred to by the Prime Minister was one which enormously simplified the accounting transactions between the two Governments at a time of unprecedented  pressure.     No other, indeed, as he suggested, would have been practicable.   Instead of a hopeless attempt being made in this country to examine and audit the war claims of the Government of India, with its attendant interchange of correspondence and vouchers, queries and answers, backwards and forwards with India, and the inevitable delays in settlement of the accounts, a special machinery was set up in India for scrutinising the expenditure, and no final claims (as distin-guisbed from requests for advances) were submitted to the War Office except on a certificate of Indian audit that they were property so chargeable.. Whether the arrangement was equally satisfactory in other respects depended upon the good faith, care and skill with which it was worked by the government of India and their officers. The Secretary of State for India in Council gave particular instructions to the Government of India at the outset that, while taking steps to see that all rightful charges against the Imperial Government arising out of the despatch of the Indian Expeditionary Forces were duly brought to account, they should be at pains to conserve faithfully the interests of that Government. That the Government of India discharged this high responsibility with entire faithfulness I am convinced. The matter does not perhaps admit of absolute proof, but there are many indications that this was so. Unprecedented steps were taken to ensure the accuracy, so far as possible, of the accounts. The war accounting arrangements were centralised, in the handfi of a Controller of War Accounts, and the Government of India specially deputed for this important post a highly efficient member of their own Financial Department, Mr. B. N. Mitra, OLE., C.B.E. Clear instructions were given to all accounting-officers as to the incidence of military expenditure as between Imperial and Indian revenues. Doubtful cases were to he referred to Mr. Mitra. The Government of India have more than once informed the Secretary of State that, wdrere a case was brought before themselves and they felt the question of incidence to he in doubt but not to require reference to the Secretary of State, it was their practice to give the decision in favour of&apos; the Imperial Government. As illustrative of their attitude I may mention that in the case of railway expenditure in India the Government of India did not charge the Imperial Government with the extra cost of movements of troops and stores unless directly connected with the despatch of the Expeditionary Forces.   In a communication on the subject they said : &quot; e.g., (a) when an officer has joined a unit proceeding. On service overseas from another unit, his rail charges have been debited to the Imperial Govern-ment,but not any charges connected with the relief of the officer so transferred ; (b) when a consignment of stores has actually been sent from a station in India to an Indian Expeditionary Force or to the War Office, the rail charges have been debited to the Imperial Government, but not any charges of internal movements connected with (i) the redistribution of stock in India, or (ii) the despatch of stores (mainly Supply and Transport) to the supply depots at Bombay and Karachi for eventual transmission to the forces.&quot; I believe this instance to have been typical of the attitude observed by the Government of India.In these circumstances, the implied suggestion in the Prime Ministers words, an implication which I am sure he did not intend to convey, that the bargain made with India at the beginning of the war was an unfavourable one for the Imperial Govern-ment, would appear to have been without foundation. As indicated above, the reverse would appear to have been the case. In confirmation of this conclusion I would like to quote, with the permission of the Secretary of State for War, the following passages from the report of the special Mission sent out to India by the War Office in
February 1921, with the concurrence of rny predecessor, to enquire into the expen-diture charged to the War Stores Suspense Account in so far as the Government of India proposed to recover it from Army funds :  &quot; 12. It will thus be seen that when the time came to close these Suspense Accounts, charges were for the first time raised against the War Office for the value of Imperial stocks provided for the war, but still lying in India, also for the value of the initial equipment issued to units and drafts raised in India at Imperial expense. These facts, which apparently had not been realised at home, account for the terminal charges being so large.! &quot; 13. Incidentally, it will be observed that this deferred payment has led to charges for interest on the capital invested in these stocks falling on Indian funds. The amount of interest is estimated at about 2,0OO,000L, and is, in effect, a contribution by India towards the cost of the war.&quot; 23. ISIo claim has been made on account of transportation of stores other . than that directly incidental to final shipment overseas. The saving to the Home Government accruing from this procedure will be appreciated from the following figures, showing expenditure on railway transport, which appear in India&apos;s yearly financial statement, viz., 1913-14, 281,000L ; 1914-15, 324,COOL ; 1915-16, 389,000L ; 1916-17, 729.000Z.; 1917-18, 987,0001.; 1918-19, 1,690,0001., &quot;The growth in these charges was stated to be due mainly to services performed for the War Office.&apos; &quot; 34. As an offset to any loss due to delay in declaring surpluses it must be borne in mind that India has been living on surplus Imperial stocks (paying full price) for a longer period than would have been the case had prompter action been taken.&quot;41. Under the terms of the agreement India has to accept in kind equip-ment, &amp;c, up to the full quantity of her pre-war stocks, including any sent overseas with pre-war units. This arrangement has in effect been carried out, and further, India is taking over, at full book value, stores needed to meet her estimated requirements to the end of March 1922. Thus India is more than fulfilling her liability under the terms of her agreement with the War Office.&quot;48.....In effect India has taken over (for the Afghan opera-fions) about 2,000,000L of the surplus stocks of food and forage (which would otherwise have had to be sold by the Disposals Board for what they would fetch).&quot;49. In addition, considerable quantities of mechanical transport, signalling equipment, mobile workshops, &amp;c, were sent from Mesopotamia at India&apos;s : request, the total value being about 2,000,OOOL   These Avere taken over on .   : ,.repayment vouchers and adjusted by direct credit to War Office.&quot; 51.    .    .    .    .

In view of the information furnished by the Indian authorities, we -saw no reason to suppose that the surpluses which would be properly charge-able to the War Office would not reach the amount stated, and we therefore^ advised that the sum of 5,000,000Z. asked for by India&quot;]&quot; should be paid.,.i   : &quot; 72. In conclusion, we wish to record that while we have made no attempt :to analyse or audit the accounts, we are satisfied that in principle the scales , have been balanced evenly as between Imperial and Indian interests.

wan, when hundreds of millionssterling, were being expended on. behal ,p ;; &apos;       the War Office..  It therefore devolved on Mr. Mitra,, as Gontrollei;,.,o&apos;  f ai-Accounts in India, to allocate expenditure- between- the two countries&quot;., and in. ; the course of our investigations we have been impressed by the impartial attitude: he has maintained throughout.&quot;As regards the sum of 2,000,0007. referred to in para. 13 I would explain that as part of the arrangement agreed to at the beginning: of the war no ehawge was . made against the War Office in respect of clothing, equipment, guns aud-animals sent from India in possession of units and: drafts, deficiencies only being claimed for ow-the return of the troops.. The; idea underlying this arrangement was that as no fresh disbursements-: by India were required until the return of the troops,, there was no- occasion to&apos;, ask for any payment before that event. The circumstances: were entirely changed when.it became necessary to expand, those units, to-send large drafts to them to replace casualties, and toi raise, clothe and equip fresh units;, and if the Government of- India had claimed advances at once in respect of the disbursements so incurred,,, as in the case of their other disbursements in respect of the Indian Expeditionary Forces,: there:is no doubt that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have agreed to their request. The Government of India decided, however, not to do so-except in the- case, of clothing, as no final claims could, under- the terins-&apos;of the arrangement,, be included in- their own accounts until the troops had returned., with the result that the cost of providing the equipment in question had to. be met by them from borrowed money until the end of the war. Moreover, in. the case of stocks provided by them as reserves for the use of the Expeditionary Forces- they asked for advances from time to time in respect of specified portions only of the outlay.-: The estimated loss to Indian revenues resulting from these two causes amounted to about 2;000;0O07:. It might indeed be argued that an application to Idis MajestyY Govern-ment for a retrospective adjustment of the original agreement: so as to recoup India for&quot;this loss would not be unreasonable, but the Government of India, have not suggested this. . - .        &apos; .-In these circumstances it will be admitted, I think, that the Government of India have done their utmost to carry out their part of the bargain in the letter and in the spirit.     - - ...        ..1- trust that my colleagues will endorse my conclusion, and that.if any.suitable occasion should present itself, the opportunity may be: taken to- state in.

Office,My dear Secretary of State for War, 20th July 1922.In December 192.(1 your..predecessor and mine discussed at, some length an application from the Government of India for an advance of 10,000,0007. in respect of transactions brought to account partly through the War Stores Suspense Account of that Government.The case was brought before the Cabinet, as the advance- would&apos; necessitate corresponding provision in the War Office Supplementary Estimates for I:920-&apos;21.In. the upshot this provision was made after some-discussion1 in the Cabinet and in the House. The debate in the House was closed by the Prime Minister. In the course of his- remarks-lie alluded to the war accounting arrangements agreed to between the Imperial and Indian- Governments in. the- early.days of the, war as a bargain which the former were obliged to make; under the pressure of- war, when there was not much time, hut, which was &quot; not the best bargain for the british taxpayer.&quot; Be added that in. taking, power to make the advance the- Imperial Government proposed to look into the account and see. what was fairly attributable to&apos;the British; taxpayer and. what ougfit to be paid by the Indian taxpayer.Your predecessor accordingly- appointed a Mission to proceed to-India tio.in cp.iire into the War Stores Suspense Account. The result of, the Mission,, a copy of the report of which, was duly communicated to this Department, was not only to satisfy the. Army Council that the desired advance of I&apos;0,000;00Q7. was justified, but to Indicate in the most generous way the manner in which the Govern.meiH-of India had carried out their part&apos;of the &quot;&apos;.bargain &quot; referred to by&quot; the-Prime-Minister. It therefore seemed to my predecessor that a memorandum- on tire-subject-should be circulated toithe- Cabinet by ray Department, recalling., what, had been said by the Prime Minister and drawing attention to the findings of the Mission,.. This would-
have been done at an earlier date, but that my Department have thought it advisable to wait until it could be said that the closure of the transactions in regard to the War Stores Suspense Account appeared to be finally in sight. That position has now been reached, and the memorandum has accordingly been prepared. I should be glad to know that yon concur in what is said in it, and that it will Lave your support in the Cabinet.Yours sincerely,Peel.Extract of Letter from the War Office, dated 8th August 1922.The Secretary of State for War asked that Lord Peel should be informed that he is prepared to raise no objection to Lord Peel circulating the memorandum to the Cabinet. At the same time, on reading through the Prime Ministers remarks, the Secretary of State feels sure that what Mr. Lloyd George meant was not to cast any reflection upon the impartiality of the Civil Servant, Mr. Mitra, appointed by the Indian Government to audit the charges made against us, but simply to criticise the arrangement by which one Government spent, another Governments money and by which payment was made by the latter on the audit of the former. Such an arrange-nient was the only practicable one in the circumstances of haste and pressure during the Great War, but from a business point of view it is strictly not defensive, as no Government spending another Governments money under war conditions can be expected to exercise the careful thought that public opinion demands in public expenditure when the war is over and we are faced with demands for economy.Subject to this interpretation of the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks, the Secretary of -State for War raises no objection to Lord PeePs proposed action.
