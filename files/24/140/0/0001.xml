[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1922.SECRET.CP. 4301.CABINET.SPECIAL  REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 78.     Period ended November 3, 1922.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed on the 30th October was 1,387,186, an increase of 9,160 over the previous week.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.Coal-mining remains steady, but conditions in this industry are still below normal.The iron and steel industry shows some improvement generally, but suspensions and discharges are still occurring in certain districts.There is no evidence of any material improvement at the shipbuilding centres. Employment in the Furness district remains bad, but on the Mersey better conditions exist and the outlook is more hopeful.The engineering industry remains quiet, except in the Midlands, where some improvement has been recorded in the motor-engineering section.Both the spinning and weaving sections of the cotton trade are experiencing considerable under-employment due primarily to shortage of orders. Severe depres-sion exists in the lace trade in the Nottingham district. In Yorkshire decreased activity at the principal textile centres is reported.In the London area the building industry remains quiet, the anticipated improvement having failed so far to materialise. There is no change in the position of this industry in the Provinces.A better tone prevails at certain centres of the boot and shoe industry in the Midlands, but there is no change in the Northampton, Stafford and Norwich districts.The seasonal improvement in the clothing trades in the London area continues, but in the North these trades are somewhat slack.The Lancashire chemical industry shows some improvement, but severe depression still obtains in glass manufacture.(Signed) C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW.November 13, 1922.
I.-DETAILED UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES.1. General Percentage oe Unemployment.[Note. Down to November 1920 the only percentages of unemployment available are those derived from Trade Union returns covering roughly 1,000,000 workers. Prom November 1920 percentages derived from the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, covering 11,000,000 to 12,000,000 workers, are also available.]At the end of  January February-March April May June July August September October November DecemberJanuary February March April May June July August september the Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent. The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union figures, was 4-7 per cent.  It was as high as 7-8 per cent in 1908 and 77 per cent in 1909.

SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment. This Committee continued to function till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &apos;&apos; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.[9076]

Benefit paid2. Appropriation for administration (2 years)..(Up to April 1922, this is on the basis of 10 per cent, chargeable on the annual revenue under Section 12 of the Unemployed Insurance Act, 1920; from April 1922, the maximum charge was increased to 12^ per cent, by the Act of April 1922, and the actual charge representing the total cost of administration has been 11 per cent.).3.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 102,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are. assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the case of schemes assisted last year. All applications must, however, be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6).   County Councils were also circulated with regard to
schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme.SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN GREAT BRITAIN AT OCTOBER 27, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABO YE.Scheme.

Up to the 2nd November, 1922, grants had been sanctioned to a total of
 2,800,802. but the full amount of the grant indicated will not be earned in every case; No fresh applications for grants of this nature are now considered, but work is still in progress on a few schemes originally approved for assistance on this basis. For the purposes only of such schemes grants may be sanctioned on the old basis to a date not later than the 31st December, 1922.(B.) Grants towards Loan Charges. (a.) Winter Programme 1921-22.Under Ministry of Health Circulars 245 and 251, of the 22nd September, 1921, and the 12th October, 1921, respectively, the Unemployment Grants Committee were authorised to make grants in approved cases to Local Authorities in Great Britain of 65 per cent, of the interest and sinking fund charges on Loans raised to meet expenditure on non-revenue producing schemes for half the term of the loan, subject to a maximum of 15 years and of 50 per cent, of the interest on Loans raised to meet expenditure on revenue-producing schemes for a period of 5 years.Up to the 2nd November, 1922, the number of Local Authorities assisted on these bases was 562.
