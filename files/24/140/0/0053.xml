Most of the first contingents from Manchester and Barrow left this morning and the Warring ton men are leaving- later in the day.The unemployed leaders are in a very awkward position and are trying to arrange a &quot;strategic retreat&quot;:    they have spent a good deal of time in the House of Commons during the last few days.Plans have been made for processions to escort the body of the Luton marchers to the station to-day.Extracts from the draft programme of the Communist International are given in this report.There has been little surface activity among communists this
13 commuthst IMMMgliThe OomErunist Party of Great Britain did not consider its &quot;programme&quot; at the recent annual, conference as it had been decided that the Communist International should draw up a programme for Ccismunist Parties throughout the world:    the draft made by BuMiarin for the considelation of the Fourth Moscow Congress has come into my possession.     It is too long for quotation in extenso hut the following extracts cover the more important points:Capitalist Slavery&quot;The inevitable sharpening of the class antagonisms is accompanied by a simultaneous consolidation of the antagonistic class forces.     on the one side the capitalist &quot;bourgeoisie forms its associations, secures its state power, and organizes its armed forces;    on the other side the wording class, brought into one oamp and united by the mechanism of capitalist production itself, creates its own powerful organisations, which are sooner or later transformed into weapons of the proletariat in the war against the bourgeoisie and its main support - state :;power...The Emancipation of the Workers and the Ctosmiunist Order.&quot;The final aim pursued by the Communist International is the substitution of the capitalist order by the Comitrunist order of Society.    The Communist order of society, prepared by the whole course of evolution, is the sole means of oscape for humanity, for it alone is able to remove the fundamental defects of the capitalist system leading to inevitable and unavoidable ruin...The Pall of the Bourgeoisie and the Fight for Communis-m.&quot;Between the Capitalist and Communist systems there lies a long period of proletarian struggle, of its victories and defeats, a period of continuous decay of capitalist relations, of national wars, of colonial uprisings, of armed and peaceful&apos; warfare of capitalist states against the Socialist states coming into&quot;being - a period which comprises temporary agreements between social-economic systems contradictory to one another, and life and death struggles between such systems.   Finally* the complete victor?; of the proletariat, and the firm establishment of the power which it has gained through so much suffering and \ privation, will be followed by an epoch of accelerated development.    The multiplicity of the conditions of the revolutionary process, the variety of types of the new relations being formed - this will be the main feature of the tedious transition period of development,   lot until this epoch lias fulfilled its historical task will society begin to become a communist society....&quot;-an unavoidable premise for the transition from Capitalism to gotxraunxsm, - the starting point without which/
which tho further evolution of mankind is entirely impo-impossible is thus the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeois State and the seisure of power hy the working class, which has : to set itself the first and most important task of suppressing the enemy and firmly establishing the new regime.    Dj-cte tor ship of the proletariat     that is the most elementary premise   for social evolution.&quot;The seizure of power by the proletariat is nothing else than the destruction of the bourgeois state apparatus by the fighting organs of the proletarian class struggle, and the organisation of a new proletarian class power by the so organs...&quot;The Soviet State differs from Bourgeois Democracy in that it openly reveals its class character, And openlj? sets itself the task of suppressing the exploiters in the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population...&quot;An essential part of the seisure of power by the working class is formed by the destruction of the bourgeois monopoly of arms, and by the concentration of arms in the hands of the proletariat.   During the course of the struggle the main object in view must be the disarmament of the bourgeoisie and the arming of the proletariat.&quot;The further organisation of the armed forces, based on strict revolutionary discipline, must be carried out on precisely the same fundamental class principle;    it must correspond to the structure of the proletarian dictatorship, and to the principles assuring leadership to the industrial proletariat.*.&quot;The victorious proletariat utilizes the power which it has seized, first, to break the resistance of the enemy and to guard the continued rule of the working class against the attacks of the bourgeoisie, and secondly, it utilizes this concentrated power for the expropriation of the expropriators, that is, for the revolutionary transformation of the economic and consequently of all other social relations.   As &amp; rule this expropriation will assume the form of confiscation, that is, by the expropriation of the means of production without compensation, and the delivery of these means into the hands of the Proletarian Stats.&quot;In this regard the Communist International proposes the following fundamental measures:1.    The expropriation of the large industrial under-taklngs, of the means of transport and traffic (telegraph, telephone), electric works, etc.2.    She proletarian nationalization of large landed estates, which are to be given over to the administration of the organs of the proletarian dictatorship;    one part of the landed estates, especially that part being worked by the peasantry under lease,to be handed over to the peasantry. The extent of the ground area to be delivered up to.the peasantry is determined by economic expediency, and by the necessity of neutralizing the peasantry, that is, by the social-political importance of the peasantry.3.   Proletarian neutralization of the banks.   Delivery otf all gold reserves, securities, etc. into the hands of theproletarian/
*\ A 0O i O- S -Proletarian Stats.    Security of the interests of small depositors, centralisation .of the banks, subordination of all large banking concerns to the Central State Bank of the republic * ,t4,    &quot;Nationalisation and rminxcipilization (communal!-, zation) of wholesale trade. *5*   &quot;Annulment (cancelation) of state debts.6.    &quot;Monopoly of foreign trade.,7.    &quot;Monopolization of the most important printing establishments and newspapers-8.    &quot;In the execution of these measures, the following principles are to be observed:&quot;Nationalisation should as a rule not be extended to small and medium properties.     The first reason for this is that the proletariat which has seized power has not the required number of organising forces at its disposal, especially during the first daj/s of the dictatorship, to enable it not only to destroy the old order, but to bring about a union of the small and medium units of production* The second reason is that the proletariat should not provoke the intermediate groups against it.     The victorious proletariat must find the right coxtrse of action to be adopted towards those spheres of production which can be subjected to centralised and systematic management, and those which would only be cumbersome ballast.    The latter must be left to private initiative.&quot;The transition from Capitalism to Socialism cannot be carried out at one stroke.    Por this reason externally capitalistic forms and methods of administration and organisation, as individual stimulation to work, pieoe work, bonus systems,  calculation in money, capitalist forms of aocounting and book-keeping, etc., are thus not only permissible during the preliminary period, but unavoidably necessary.    The proletariat must devote particularly careful attention and the utmost precaution with regard to reciprocal relations between city and country, and set-up no barriers to. the individualistic working motives of the peasantry...&quot;The struggle for the expropriation of the expropriators, requires a most thorough study of all elements of this struggle.    The big bourgeoisie &quot;and the rich landowner, as well as that part of the officers1 and army staff subject to them, are the most consistent enemies of the working class, and a bitter struggle against them is absolutely inevitable. As a rule it is only possible to utilize the organized powers of these circles after the dictatorship has been established, and all conspiracies of exploitation and uprisings have been determinedly suppressed...&quot;One of the most important tasks of the proletariat is to train skilled technicians from the ranks of the working class, not only in the sphere of production (engineers, mechanics, organisers, book-keepers, etc.), but for scientific and military work, etc,     This is the only way possible, of enabling fresh groups of qualified workers to be continually added to the proletarian joower, bo that this may in reality become a power leading the development of society...&quot;Under/
- 4s &quot;*&quot;Under the Joe^ading of combatting bourgeois prejudices and superstitions, the first place is taken by the fight against religion, a fight which must be carried on with all requisite tact and all caution, especially among those sections of workers in whose daily life religion has hitherto been deeply rooted...&quot;The main support of the gigantic imperialist state were and are the artificially created relations between the colonies and half-colonies, and imperialist mother countries. The colonial and national questions thus play an exceedingly important role, not only from the viewpoint of the decay of capitalist relations, but also from the viewpoint of capitalist structure...&quot;The liberation of the colonies, and the support of all colonial movements against imperialism.    In the case of a proletarian state embracing former colonies, the latter-are accorded the right of separation...The Road to the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.&quot;The most important problem towards winning over the masses is to win over the trade unions, and to free these from the ideological and organisational influence of the Social Democracy.   Unless the majority in the trade unions is won over, the realization of the proletarian dictatorship is unthinkable.    In precisely the same manner, special attention if to be devoted to the working youth and women, for the attitude adopted by these during the first phase v   of the dictatorship, will largely determine the course of; events.&quot;The process of uniting the masses under the Communist flag must be developed in all actual questions of daily life.   Above all the fight against imperialism and militarism, the fight against the danger of fresh imperialist; wars, etc. *&quot;Other questions coming under this heading are those * connected with the struggle against the economic results of the war and post-war crisis.    (Fight against increased prices, against unemployment, against longer working hours, against higher taxation, etc)&quot;The support of Soviet Russia, as a means towards strengthening it and towards mobilizing the masses about this anti-capitalist centre point, constitutes the most powerful  I organizing instrument in the hands of the international working class.&quot;For the co-ordination of actions, and for the purposeful leadership of the same, the International proletariat requires an international class discipline, which must above all be strictly adhered to in the ranks of the Communist Parties. This international Communist discipline must be expressed by the subordination of all partial and local interests of the movement to its general and permanent interests, and by the unqualified execution of all resolutions passed by the leading organs   of the Communist International.*COMMUNISTSOwing to the continued absence of,the British delegatesin/.
in Moscow where the plans of the &quot;Third International for the coming year are &quot;being completed, there is a lull in the Aurfaee activity of oomm&apos;onists in this country.The Organising Bureau, however, is doing its best to give effect in the various districts to the Commission Report Branches have been instructed to compile a complete register of all members, as nin order to set up and direct new party organisation with its various groups, nuclei, local centres etc. it is absolutely essential that the -Party lead, both at the District Centre and at Headquarters should have detailed information of the activities of every member of the party &apos;.The Central Scottish Committee has decided to shoulder the financial responsibilities of the division until the end of the year &quot;but after that it wishes to be absolved from any further liability:   the question of maintaining the present premises at 196, St. Yiacent Street is to be settled &quot;by the District Conference.The Central Scottish Committee is prepared to start Partclasses on the following subjectsRise of Trade Unionism - J0R* CampbellCo-operatives - B.^?* Whit he adThe Labour Party - , A. RitchieA.B.C iii Communism - A. Ferguson.Further light is thrown upon the circumstances in whichthe &quot;Communist Daily&quot; was produced by the followingcommunication which emanates from the manager of &quot;TheCommunist&quot;:**** We can only say that jour branch cannot appreciate the great difficulties under which the paper was produced or dispatched, or it would not take up the attitude it does.    For 10 days previous to date of publication we unsuccessfully tried to get a printer, and after approaching 23 in all, we only eventually get cue definitely at mid-*day on the day previous to the d&amp;t of first dispatch,,   As previous to that time we had no idea what it weuld cost us for printing otc* we could make no decision about terms, and during the days vtdispatch/
dispatch we were so overwhelmed with work thai; it was impossible to get out a notice on the question of terms.&quot;Bven if every branch paid in for papors had at the rate of one penny per copy wo should still lose on the transaction; and in view of the political significance of the issue of the publication we think you should meet your obligation by settling up for actual copies sold without grumbling.&quot;On November 29th the Sto Pimoras Borough Council rescinded by 44 to 12 votes a resolution passed in September 1921 to accept a copy of &quot;The Communist international&quot; for use in the Highgate Library:   a further resolution instructing that &quot;no ccmnrunistie publications of any description&quot; shall he placed in the libraries under the control of the Council in the future was withdrawn by the proposer, who stated that she would Tfcring it up at a subsequent meeting.It is reported that two sailors in H.M.S. &quot;Dragon&quot; are prospective members of the Communist party:   they have applied to Tom Bell for full reports of Walton Newbold&apos;s speeches as he had &quot;aroused so much enthusiasm by his speech and actions in the House,&quot;L. Welsh has reported to his secretary that on December 1st he addressed the HarlesSen branch of the National Union of Railwaymon on the &quot;Industrial Truce&quot;:    there were about 50 members present who &quot;soemed interested&quot;:    &quot;the chairman MacLelland, agreed to Join the party a little later on-&quot;Robert Stewart has been put in charge of the Children&apos;s sido of the Workers&apos; International Russian Relief Committee in this county and, act lag on tho suggestion of Dr. polotsev fArcos) has asked Helen Crawfurd to come to London and assist him.On November 31st L.N.

Please increase cur number to 300 per w&amp;ek.    Well comrade three mere men are to be hanged.    We have been carrying cn a good deal of militant agitation and it is within the bounds of possibility that a general strike may take place. At present we are the only body carrying on the open air meetings.    We are about to re-organise the Party again.   A fair ncrber of ycung men are eager te join up, and are arranging a meeting at Jeppes town this week, at which I am invited to speak.    They are mostly members of the famous Jeppe Commands that took charge of the district during tho revolt.    They have already get busy selling the TDreadnought1. Communism Is gaining ground rapidly here.    Tom Mann is spooking well.     The Binoni branch of the Third International are having a social tomorrow.

PHILIPS PRICEThe following interesting statement regarding theposition of philips Price in relation to the BritishCormnunist Party was mado by Inkpin on December 4th:&quot;I understand that the application of comrade M. Philips Price for membership of the Communist Party is to corno before the meeting of the West Central Branch to-morrow.    The point may possibly arise as to the continuance of Comrade Price*s membership of the Gloucester Independent Labour Party, and it would be as well that I should make an explanation.     As a general rule, dual membership in the Communist Party and the Independent Labour party is not permissible, except in very exceptional cases that are sanctioned by the central executive committee.    In this case the central executive are of opinion that exceptional consideration is necessary, and they are agreeable that comrade Price&apos;a membership in the Gloucester Independent Labour Party shall be continued.&quot;TUB UieilPlOYEDThe position in regard to the unemployed marchers is that, on the one hand, many of those In London desire to go home and some have gone, while on the other, several contingents are marching to London and a few have arrived.Of the first category, it is reported that a petition has been addressed by many of the marchers to their leaders at Q.139en1 &amp; Square, asking them to arrange for their return home:   some of the men quartered in North London are reported to have asked the Guardians to pay their fares:   among the men themselves there is a good deal of friction:   the men from Barrow, for instance, are reported to be dissatisfied as they say they are not receiving their fair share of the money collected en route and they are not getting the same olass of food as their leaders.     Thay are reported to have collected  80 between Barrow and Lanoaster.The following is a summary of information regarding thesecond/

The unemployed petition was directed by the speaker to be brought to the Table onDeoember 5th. &quot;There has been some talk of the unemployed creating adisturbance in the Strangers&apos; Gallery but it seems thatthe wilder spirits have been persuaded to await the resultof more peaceful efforts.    Soderberg is said to haveinspired the feeble attempt to create a sensation in theCentral Hell on December 5th when a few communists refusedto remove their hats when the Spo^I;er&apos;s Procession passed through and sang the &quot;Red Flag&quot;:    among the men presentwere:Gunnar Soderberg, Torn Dinfjley, Gordon Currie, Rev. T. Pickering, G. Wheeler, Ton Cooper.The continued desertion of marchers is causing the gravest concern to their leaders and on December 2nd themarshals held a special meeting at which 33 voted for themen returning home and 29 for them remaining in London:    theScottish marshals said that they would sever theirconnection with tho National Administrative Council if themen/
c5^0men were sent &quot;back Immediately and efforts are now beingmade to find a way out which, will save the face of theleaders:    one plan is to persuade the leaders of the LabourParty to request the men to return home, thereby shiftingthe onus from the unemployed officials.    On December 4thHaye wrote to the Midlands organiser of the Communist party:&quot;With reference to your remarks concerning a strategic retreat., the question is &quot;being dibou-aded along these lines at this end.    Personally I aia not in favour, as considering the faces tha* there are 1,000 or more men on the road from diffsroxtt -Listriots, it is an item which has got to he -SeaIt w.it?*, a-if. if we are to tell these men they &quot;hare got to go hack after accomplishing half their journeys it; is just as lixely to cause disorganisation au anything else.,   At any rate things will soon sort themselves out, I suppose, and we must wait&apos; developments. &quot;The following extracts are taken from a document written by one of the Chief Marshals at the end of last week:&quot;As for the position down here everything would be alright but for the bad leadership of the National   [ &quot;limelighters&quot;.    The Corommists are in the majority. I maintain that if the right tactics had been used ithat it would not have been necessary to call for more reinforcements.   A great tactless blunder arose... Personally I don&apos;t think Lav/ will climb down now.    After all wo have got out of the march what we intended and expected.&quot;Several meetings have been held in London at which the general theme of the speeches has been reiteration of the demands to see the Prime Minister and the importance of the reinforcements marching to London.Under she Leading &quot;Sabotage&quot; it is indignantly related in the current issue of &quot;The Communist&quot; that one of the directors of the Victoria House Printing Company &quot;a subsidiary concern of the *Daily Herald1&quot; frustrated an attempt of the Communist Party to have 50,000 leaflets printed for distribution among the unemployed.    The text was accordingly given in &quot;Trie Communist&quot; and contained the/
- IS -&quot;Unemployed be on your Guard.&quot;The Government Is trying to triok you.   It talks big and makes fine promises about TRelief Schemes1 to find you work...&quot;There is no work for you.&quot;Representative capitalist spokesmen like Amery and Macnamara say there is no prospect of unemployment decreasing...    Capitalism has failed you. Are you to be merely pawns in this Imperialist game    &apos; of esrploitation?&quot;Why should you suffer?&quot;Your v.;ives and children cry for bread.    Those who form this Government are not hungry.   Will their fine polished promises fill your bellies?   You y/ould be oraven cowards, indeed, if you did not make a stand HOW th.ut you are assembled in your thousands.&quot;Be Man 3&quot;Accept the challenge of the well-fed and comfortable class which Bozrnr Lcav ropresents. -&quot;Hold tightJ   Reinforcements are coming to your aid.   Even now your brothers are marching from all parts of the country to swell your numbers.&quot;BONAR LAW MUST RESPECT YOUR CLAIM to be treated as human beings.   He will, if you stand firm.   Be not deceived by the gi^eat lying Press about Coraaunism or the Communist p..&apos;.rty.&quot;The Communist party is ever with you in your struggle for bread and work.    It will not fail you now.&quot;Remember, millions of your fellows are looking to you anxiously and hopefully;    your fight is the fight of those in work.&quot;You must see the Prime Minister.&quot;Demand that the Labour M.P*s. help you.&quot;Demand that the General Council helps you.&quot;Eee&quot; shoulder to shoulder:   Victory is yours.&quot;IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINIt may safely be said that more than 90$ of the Irish in Great Britain are in favour of the Pree State, and the remaining small minority are not among those who count socially, politically or in the commercial world.   They are mainly young men and women led by fanatics and intriguers.   Afew/
- 13 &quot; ...   3few may be dangerous &quot;but tbe-majority have neither pluck nor intelligence.   The potential danger here lies in desperadoes brought over from Ireland, who have been trained to commit&apos; outrages, and who see no danger owing to the practical immunity hitherto enjoyed in their own country.   They do hot. understand the difference between the attitude of the public in England and in Ireland where there is a general sauve qui peut as soon as the shooting starts.The current issue of the &quot;Workers1 Republic&quot;, organ of the Communist Party of Beland, published in England, is full of abuse of the Irish Labour party for their action, or want of action, in connection with the recent executions. It calls upon the Workers of Ireland to act at once and to force the representatives of Irish labour to call for general action by the organised workers to save the prisonersA correspondent who recently visited Manchester says the official British labour Party   is perturbed over the growing influence of extremists in England and Scotland and the friendship existing between them and the Irish Republicans.A Scottish correspondent also calls attention to this phaso of the situation.   Ho ccys that Robinson, the Irish Republican leader, and the Communists, are still discussing the question of arming.    The difficulty seems to be that the rank and file of the communists, unlike the irltsh Republican Army, cannot be depended upon to fight.Art CBrien1 s meeting to repudiate the Jii-ticl.es of Agreement, arranged to take place at St. P^acras&apos; Baths, on December 6th, a date fixed to coincide with the coming into existence of the Free State, has been widely advertised. Handbills were distributed at the doors of all Roman Catholic Churches on Sunday last.    Laurence Gianell and Mrs. Cath&amp;lBrugha/
Brugha are to be the principal speakers and no effort is being spared to make the meeting a success.     A special point will be made of the executions in Ireland and other alleged atrocities perpetrated ig the name of the Free State.Robinson, who has now changed his address from 10, Robson Street to 284, Crown Streetj Glasgow, has retired from the position of Republican Organiser and will confine himself to the military side of the movement.Robinson is still pushing the sale of the Scottish edition of the &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; chiefly through secretaries of clubs.   Hunan of 76, lieson Grove, London, sont Robinson  4.^.6., which shows that a good many copies of the paper are reaching this city.
