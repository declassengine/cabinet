This Document is the Property at His Britannic Majesty1 s Government) mCopy No.CABINET.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(1.   I desire to call the attention of my colleagues to the gravity of the financial position with which the Government is likely to be confronted in connection with the Budget for 1923/24 in order that they may realise hoW completely the policy of the Government must be dominated by the financial position * The best estimate of   the ordinary revenue in 1923/24 which I can frame at the present time, on the basis of existing taxation being continued, is  760 millions (Including  10 millions from Excess Profits Duty).     Against this it will be necessary to provide  400 millions in respect of the service of the National Debt and other charges on the Consolidated Pund*     At this date the provision for debt services Is most difficult to calculate in view of the uncertainty as to the provision required for payments to the United States of America, for short-term borrowings and for obligatory sinking funds, but I am satisfied that it would not be safe to allow any smaller sum than the above.   This leaves a balance of  360 millions to meet ordinary Supply expenditure which totalled over  444 millions on preliminary forecasts made by Departments last summer.2.     The late Government appointed two Committees to inquire into expenditure on (a) the Fighting Services, including the Middle East,   and (b) Civil Supply Services respectively.    ThefirstSECRET. .P. 4330.
first of these Committees was unable to complete its investigations and accordingly no reduction has yet formally been suggested in the estimates prepared by thte Service Departments which represented an expenditure falling on the Ordinary Budget of  131 millions,   apart from expenditure arising in respect of the Near East crisis, the late Government had approved an expenditure on expansion of the Air Force by 20 squadrons, and an anticipated reduction on the garrison of Irak from 9 to 4 battalions has not taken place.The Committee dealing with Civil expenditure was presented with estimates amounting In all to  305,830,659,, to which must be added a sum of  7^ millions, in consequence of the decision to postpone the reduction of war pensions which was to have been effected next April.The grand total of all estimates of ordinary expenditure thus amounted to over  444 millions.3*     The Civil Expend!ture -Committee made a report (CP. 4270) suggesting economies amoxmlJLng - to  l7,-44r4^ If these are adopted In their entirety the deficit of ^ver  84 millions shewn in paragraph 1 above would be reduced to about  67 millions but I must point out that some of these Economies have already been objected to by Departmental Ministers In the late and their successors in the present Government.4.     fith the prospect of a deficit of  67 millions on t^ie ordinary Budget for 1923-24 It does not seem to me t&amp; be possible to face an expenditure of  131,000^000 on the ordinary Services sf the Navy, Army, and Air Force;   and a reductionof
of this figure by  11 or  12 millions would still leave a deficit equivalent to an extra 1/- in the   on the Income&quot;Tax.5.     The preceding paragraphs relate to the ordinary Budget of the year;     on the extraoi&apos;dInary Budget, which represents the sale of war stores etc., less certain terminal! charges due to the war, there is a prospect of a surplus, but it may not exceed  20 millions.6.     The   figures I have given do not include any provision for extra grants for North, or South Ireland or for agriculture, unemployment, or any new or expanded services.(Intld) .
