The Empire Cotton Growing Corporation was established by Royal Charter in November, 1921, with the object of extending and promoting the growing and cultivation of cotton through the British Empire,   The Administrative Council of the Corporation consists of representatives of certain Government Departments, of Governments of the Overseas Dominions where cotton growing is possible, and various organisations concerned in the Cotton Industry in this country (including the Trade Unions) and other bodies interested, such as Chambers of Commerce.   The funds of the Corporation are under the control of a Board of Trustees of whom six are Ministers of the Crown or their nominees, and six are representatives of organisations oonoerned directly in the cotton industry, Including the Trade Unions.The Government have made a capital grant of  978,715 to the Corporation, subject to certain conditions, the chief being that the cotton industry should also contribute substantially to the funds of the Corporation.   Spinners owning 91 per cent, of the Spinning spindles in this country have agreed to pay a contribu-tion at the rate of sixpence per 500 lbs. of cotton consumed by them, on the assumption that this contribution will be made by all spinners,   *n normal times this should produce a sum of not less than  75,000 a year0   The Liverpool and Manchester Cotton Associations are willing to undertake the collection of the con-tributlons, but they have no power to enforce payment.   So long as the contribution is not enforceable there will be a certain number of spinners who will refuse to pay it, and this will affect the willingness of othe3^3, who will regard it as unfair that they should contribute whilst some who will equally benefit
by the work of the Corporation do not.     A proposal that the contribution should be made compulsory has been approved by the owners of 79 per cent, of the spinning spindles In the country;   It Is supported by the Liverpool and Manchester Cotton Associations, the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners1 Associations, the Cotton Spinners1 and Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Trade Unions engaged in the cotton Industry,A Bill making the levy compulsory, itea to make it re*. coverable by the Corporation from the cotton spinner as if the same were a contract debt due by the cotton spinner to the Corporation, was introduced as a private member^ Bill last Session,  supported by representative Coalition Unionists and Liberal members, Independent Liberals and Labour members.   It was blocked by one or two private members, and it was not possible for the Government to give facilities for its passage last SessionsThe extension of cotton growing within the Empire is a matter of urgent necessity;    the United Kingdom is at present dependent for Its cotton supplies almost entirely on Egypt for material for the spinning of the finer kinds, and the United States for the bulk of its requirements.   The Egyptian crop has declined and whatever recovery there may be in that direction in the next few years, It Is certain that the United Kingdom will In the future not be able to draw on the United States to any-thing like the same extent as in the past.   Further the work of the Corporation will be a most practical step towards the economic development of the Empire, especially in cur African possessions; and, in view particularly of the proposed Imperial Economic Conference, It is important to get it on to a satisfactory footing without delay.It is in my opinion most desirable that a Bill making the contribution compulsory should be passed as early as possible next Session,   There are two possible courses.    One is for the Bill to be introduced as a Government measure;    the other is for it to be introduced as a private members Bill, at the
beginning of the Session with an intimation that if any difficulty is experienced, such as arose last Session, the Government will take up the Bill and give all necessary facilities for its passage.    The second appears to me the better course,  since the Bill would then be clearly shown to be, what it is in fact, a measure desired by a great trade with practical unanimity;    and I am advised that if an announcement that the Government will give full support to the Bill can be made at an early date it is unlikely that there will be any dropping-off in the contributions which are now being made voluntarily by a large number of spinners in anticipation of the levy being made compulsory.As Chairman of the Trustees, I daall be meeting the Administrative Council of the Corporation within the next fortnight, and I should be glad to have the authority of my colleagues to assure them then of full Government support to the Bill, and also to state definitely that if the Bill is Introduced as a private member&apos;s Bill the Government will give it full facilities.(Initialled) P.LL-G.30.XI.22.
