SIS DOCUMENT lb THE PROPERTY Oi HIS BRITAliKIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.:oret ^Standing Joint Committee ior Ex-Service Questions. , p. ---.--------------------------------------------------373. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.      With regard to the memorandum by the Minister of Pensions (CP. 4372) as to the scope of the Standing Joint Committee for Ex-Service Hen&apos;s Questions:    the points at issue are shortly two:(i) Whether the Committee should have jurisdiction to deal with questions whioh affect pre-war men and post-war men, or whether their deliberations should be confined to questions affecting great-war mens(ii) Apart from the decision on jurisdiction, whether it is not possible and desirable to continue the work of the Committee on the compromise basis of July last which was aooepted by all Government Departments other than the Ministry of. Pensions  (see Appendix A).2.      Questions affecting all three classes of men have been the subject of discussion by the Committee for some time, but the War Office, when giving information regarding questions affecting pre-war men and post-war men, have generally stated that they do so as a matter of courtesy, at the same time expressing the opinion that strictly such questions were outside the scope of the Committee.3.      The number of such questions,  i.e.,  questions affecting pre-war and post-war men, have been relatively few, and. not infrequently, particularly in regard to questions affecting/post-war
post-war men,  it has appeared that indirectly the interests of great-war men are involved,  or that the particular question proposed could he put as a great-war case  just as properly as, say,  a post-war case,4.      The question of jurisdiction has been under discussion for some time,  the issue being first raised in July? 1921j    on this question of jurisdiction itself my predecessor expressed the view that he saw no objection to the fuller scope proposed by the Legion:      and in this the Admiralty in their letter of 16th 1&apos;obruary,  1922 to the Ministry of Labour concurred,  but the War Office and the   .aix- Ministry were against such an extension; and the Ministry of Pensions took up a position similar to that now outlined in the Ilenorandum CP,  4372.      The matter had therefore reached something in the nature of a deadlock so far as the Departments wore concernede    Meanwhile the Legion pressed for a decision and for a reference to the Cabinet if necessary. A good deal of correspondence passed on the subject in the early months of 1922e5.      In view of this difficulty tho Minister of Labour felt it was desirable to postpone,  if possible,  the question of jurisdiction;    and to arrange a working compromise for a time. The Cabinet was engrossed with much heavy business;    and in the meantime many great-war questions were getting, settled,  and the activity oi  the Committee was steadily dwindling. 6.      I therefore proposed in July 1922 on behalf oi the Ministry of Labour a compromise to Government Departments,  and especially the War Office, as a working arrangement  (a copy of which is annexed, A).    All tho Service Departments agreed to this for 12 months;    but to my surprise the Ministry of Pensions dissented from the idea of a compromise and pressed for a decisio on the question of principle as stated at the foot of the memorandum.    It is true that the Legion were also pressing for a decision on jurisdiction, but the Legion were also aware that/the
the Government Departments had expressed differences of view.In fact the compromise arrangement as outlined in the memorandum (Appendix a) has been in operation at recent meetings of the Committee and is proving not unsatisfactory.    It appears to me still desirable if possible to postpone a decision on the main issue of jurisdiction and to avoid raising a question which if decided definitely against the Legion, is likely to involve considerable and possibly bitter controversy with them. 8.     There is a special reason at the present moment for desiring to postpone a decision which, if pressed, may force tho War office (and as the War Office is the Chief Service Department concerned, possibly also the Cabinet) to take up a definitely &quot;non possumus&quot; attitude.      It will be rerembered that the Ministry oi Labour will bo closely associated for some time with the British Legion in carrying out the recommendations of the Select Committee on the Employment and Training of Disabled Men, particularly in connection with the work of local King&apos;s Roll Committees and the King1s Roll national Council.    I should be sorry,  therefore, if friction arose with the Legion at the moment. 9.     With these considerations in view, I suggest that the working arrangement outlined in the memorandum (Appendix A) should bo definitely accepted by all Government Departments,  including the Ministry of Pensions and should continue for a period of twelvo months;    but without in any way prejudicing tho right oi the Government at the end oi the period to reconsider the matter of jurisdiction.   During the period of twelve months, additional experience would be gained regarding the nature of the questions which the Legion would wish the Committee to discuss, 10.     Although the British Lcprion at the last meeting of the Committee stated they were unable to accept the twelvo months&apos;/proposal
proposal and asked that the broad question of jurisdiction might immediately be submitted to the Cabinet, I an hopeful that if Government Departments were agreed on insisting on the compromise ior another   twelve months, and the Cabinet so directed, the Legion would accept the status quo for the period mentioned.I therefore ask that the compromise should be continued for   twelve months and that if necessary the Cabinet should give directions accordingly.(Initialled) C.A.H.B.December 25th, 1923.
SIA^EIEG JOIfcT COLMITTEE I-OR EX-SERVICE QUESTIONSMemorandum regarding Scope of the Committee as circulated to the Government Departments represented on the Committee together with a Statement showing the present position,,h e u o r a    d u ii.The Chairman on behalf of the Committee has had further discussion with the Departments concerned on the subject of the position of the Joint Standing Committee in relation to questions affecting post-war ex-Service noneIt is clear that a question raised in connection with an ex-soldier may frequently have application to an ex-soldier of the Great War as well as to a post-war soldier, although the question may happen to arise first on a post-war case,    It has accordingly been proposed and agreed to by all Government Departments concerned that questions of such a character nay be raised and replied to by the representative of the Departments; including the War Office,  without specifying whether they arise in the first instance on a Great War or a post-war case.    If in the course of the discussion it becomes clear that the case in question is a post-war one,  ordinarily the discussion will not be pursued unless or until it appears that some Great War case is,  or may be, also involved.This arrangement will be adopted for the ensuing twelve months,, at the end of which jjeriod the position will be reviewed in the lirht 01 the character and extent of the questions that have in fact come up.G T A T r Li L h i.The position is that the above memorandum has been agreed by the War Office, Air Ministry and the Ministry of Labour./The
The Admiralty have also signified their agreement provided that &quot;soldier&quot; is amended to read &quot;service man&quot; and also pro-vided that some arrangement is made for allowing individual ex-Service men or ex-service associations not represented on the Committee to submit their cases to it.    In connection with the latter provision the lollcwing letter has been received from the Admiralty,Sir,With reference to Sir Montague Barlow&apos;s letter to Mr. Amery dated the 26th ultimo regarding the competence of tho Standing Joint Committee for Ex-Service Questions to discuss questions oi post-war pensions administration, etc., I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you for the information of the Minister of Labour that this matter has been reconsidered, and that they will raise nc objection to problems affecting men discharged from the service subsequently to the War being put before the Committee as long as it is in existence, or to the Committee being placed on a permanent basis, provided that there will be full opportunity for all ex-Service men to have access to and be able to lay their case before the Committee, and that some arrangement will be made for allowing individual ex-Servico men or ex-Service associations not represented, on the Committee to submit their cases to it.It should, however, be clearly understood that all questions concerning men actually serving must be treated as outside the scope oi  the Committee.I am,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) CHARLES WALKER,The Secretary,Ministry of Labour.The Minister of Pensions however, has stated that he is doubtful whether the procedure outlined in the memorandum would provide a solution oi the question   and wishes to consider thematter further:-er.
