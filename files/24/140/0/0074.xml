SECRET.CP. 4374.CABINET.GENERAL SMUTS AND IMPERIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues an extract from a private letter which I have received from the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa, dated the 28th November, 1922.DEVONSHIRE.December 27, 1922.J406&quot;The Prime Minister&apos;s active participation and interest in Imperial policy began for all practical purposes when he and General Botha visited England during and after the war. He consequently became very intimate with members of the late Government, many of whom were great personal friends familiar with his views in all subjects of common interest. Although he has naturally never given me any definite reason to imagine so, I think he may feel that, as he has not the advantage of personal acquaintance with many of the new Cabinet, they cannot be expected to understand his views so well, or be as sympathetically disposed towards them, as were the men he has known ever since he first went to England en political missions. It is quite possible that this feeling is shared by other Premiers, and it seems to me that the best way to dispel it would be to convene an Imperial Conference about the middle of next year. I can confidently assure you that such a proposal would receive the enthusiastic support of Smuts, who, on the other hand, does not think a purely economic conference would be of any great value. It is my own humble opinion that an early Imperial Conference would be most useful.&apos;&apos; From his experience of past conferences, the Prime Minister has come to regard the Secretariat under Maurice Hankey as a most valuable organisation, at any rate from the Dominions point of view. Without it, he is afraid that Cabinet decisions of Imperial moment may in numerous instances find a cut de sac in the one or more interested Departments. As a recent instance, he quotes the importance to this and other Dominions of the Imperial Governments agreement with Canada to relax the embargo on the importation of cattle into England. I think he feels, too, that Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s reported inclination to abstain from intruding into the spheres of other Ministers, however excellent in itself, would, in the absence of an efficient secretariat, tend to set up a Government of watertight compartments and deprive the Colonial Office and Dominions of much useful information which would formerly have been circulated to them. It is clear that the British Prime Minister cannot be expected to be familiar with everything that is going on, and General Smuts feels that the value of direct communication between Prime Ministers (to which Dominions attach so much importance) would be neutralised, or at least greatly depreciated, by the abolition of the Secretariat.&quot;Foreign Policy.&quot; What I admire most about General Smuts&apos;s foreign policy is his confidence in the strength of the British Empire. He considers we have emerged from the war as the greatest force in the world, and are entitled to follow an independent foreign policy of our own. He is of the opinion that the peace of the world can best be secured by co-operation with the United States in an effort to rescue Europe from the hereditary animosities that have devastated it for so many centuries. He accordingly[9274]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1922.
welcomed the announcement that the new Government meant to foster friendly relations with America, but, on the other hand, he is afraid they will incline too much towards France. In fact, I know he has a profound distrust for the French, and considers their present policy opposed to the best interests of the Empire. He is convinced they are aiming at the hegemony of Europe, and feels that, as far as we are concerned, the war will have been fought in vain if the removal of one military tyrant in that continent is followed by the instalment of another. He believes that the most important function of our foreign policy is its binding influence on the Empire. He is strongly in favour of our agreeing upon a foreign policy in Imperial Conference, and pursuing it thereafter in unison without relying upon the support of Allies who have no thought for anything but their own ambitions, and who have not hesitated to intrigue with our common enemies, and even to desert us in the field before the conclusion of peace.&quot;
