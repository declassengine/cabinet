The majority of the men are discouraged, and many are inclined to break: away from their leaders.Communist Party officials are devoting a good deal of attention to Parliamentary matters:   W. Gallacher ha3 been put in charge of this ph&amp;3e of their activity.A series of district? conferences are to be held to give jeffeot to the reorganisation necessitated by the application of the Moscow Theses.I1 Details are given of a &quot;State Guarantee Loan&quot; which is to fpe issued by the International Workers * Relief Organisation, . packed by the Soviet Government.It is requested that this document may be &quot;*        Treated as [ highly i conf ident xal.SECRET Special- Branch,Report No. 183.

THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONALOn or about November 15th Earl Rudek addressedthe Fourth Congress of the Third International on&quot;The Capitalist Offensive&quot;:    the following extracts from his speech are taken from the Supplement toNo. 101 of the &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot;:... &quot;After the Napoleonic wars, Owen pointed out that England&quot;a only salvation was her monopoly as an industrial state.     And now the sole possibility of salvation would be electrification for the purpose of increasing production.     This is, however, impossible,  as great sections of the world are impoverished end the markets destroyed. Therefore capitalism seeks to save itself at the expense of the workers only.      Stinxves1 pi en is to relieve the bourgeoisie and to shirt the burden on to the broad masses of the people.     In this, BtifSlish end French bourgeoisie alike are in full agreement, as well as the new Italian prime minister Mussolini.     Their plan is:    reduction of wages,  longer working hours, and the rendering of all socialization impossible...&quot;The import of our united front campaign is this.     We want to force a break with the coalition policy.     Up to now the united front agitation in the Ooa&amp;ranist Partlas has not been energetic enough-     The pressure from below must he increased^ but without abandoning negotiations with the heads*     Where demands for inox eased wages do not suffice,  questions of politics and organisation should be raised,&quot;The main watch-word should be the control of production.&quot;We must fight for the seizure of real values, and not only in Germany, but everywhere, and this is impossible without control of production.     We must also demand the t the armed forces consist of workers organised in the trade unions.     If the Social Democrats will break with the bourgeoisie, and fight for a real workers1 government and a real class policy, we are ready to support them...&quot;The slogan of the workers1 government is a positive one for the mobilisation of the working masses.     The bourgeoisie will combat the workers&quot; government, will have recourse to civil war, -by which the workers1 government will xn a sense be rendered a preliminary step to the dictatorship.&quot;A new offensive of the broad masses of the workers will begin -with the slogan:    fight for the control of production and for the workersr government.&quot;In view of the statements which have recently appeared in some newspapers it may be mentioned that RadekHas/i
has not &quot;boeir^-diMs-iJomr^^MB COMSUNISQBCommunist officials in London- axo-^l7iiX-dreTX*1rin^: much attention to parliamentary natters:   William Gal lecher lias teen put in charge of the Parliamentary work of the Party ana has stated that he has &quot;to prepare material and fashion questions for Newbold and Saklatvala and may possibly have to mate use of others&quot;:   referring to the &quot;field night&quot; of the &quot;Scottish crowd&quot; Gallacher   doubts &quot;whether they will be allowed to keep it up...if they keep on as they have started there will be a split In the Labour Party   sure and I don&quot;t think they&apos;11 have the courage to face that.    Of course I won&apos;t say that to them, Illl clo my best to strengthen them and encourage them for the struggle that lies ahead.&quot;Saklatvala, on the other hand, &quot;only hopes our King Street friends will not desire us to advertise programmes instead of quietly achieving results.&quot;It would appear that communist speeches made in the House are to be used for propaganda in the country, as Gallacher has sent Hansard to J.R. Campbell and has infoxmed him that the whole of Newboldle speech will be published in &quot;The Communist&quot;.The Scottish organiser is of opinion that the party should develop its Influence immediately in Hotherwell, Dundee and Greenock:   in Motherwell particularly he thinks that there are &quot;immense potentialities&quot; and suggests that the workers in the recent election, numbering about 200, should be given
a &quot;free social&quot; in order to rope them in to the Party.A secretary of one of the London tranches of the Conmiunist Party has asked the political seoretary for a ruling on&quot;the tactic of boring from within the labour Party&quot;: the points he raises are:1.     Should communists work as loyal members and slov,(ly gain influence and power? or .     Should they openly declare themselves communists,demanding their right to be within the Labour Party and advocate communism and &quot;be prepared to be thrown out&quot;?In accordance with the plans for the re-organisation of the Party on the lines of the Moscow Theses arrangements for the various Sistrict conferences are being completed.On November 25th sixty-one delegates, representing thirtyseven branches, attended the London District Conference ofthe Communist Piirty of Great Britain, (the first of the series):     among those present were R. Ptilme Dutt, R. PageArnot, G. Deacon, H. Pollitt, E.W.Cant .and Bacharach.     Therecommendations of the Central London Committee in regardto district organisation were accepted and a districtcommittee of the following members was elected:Rust,Irvine,Hawkins,Wall,Eerran,Savage.Mary Mo o rhouse. In addition to the above the Young Communist league, the Red Internetional of Labour Unions and the Womenls Section will each have one representative on the District Committee.     On the motion of Page Arnot it was resolved that should occasion arise this committee would be dissolved and one substituted by the national Executive:   Araot pointed out that, owing to the party&apos;s activities, a situation might /
might; arise in which, the committee might have to be underground.     0. Palme Dutt and Rowland Hill were appointed audito rs.She Manchester District Conference is to &quot;be held in the Socialist Hsll, Margaret Street, on December 2nd:    the scheme for local re-organ! sat ion was outlined in Eeport No. 181 but final instructions for the guidance of the conference have been sent from King Street:    in this document the functions of the Political and Organising Bureaux are laid down as follows:-Political Bureau&quot;The Political Bureau when in full order should comprise the following departments, each with a Committee:1.

On the whole, however, the response to Headquarters&apos; &quot;Oi.ll to Jetton&quot; has be em disappointing to the organisers.The Organising Bureau of the Communist Party has instructed Hannington &quot;to avoid any extreme measures whatsoever&quot; as it is thought that any riotous behaviour will have a detrimental effect on the communist movement. Hannington has been told not to call at King Street but to\ meet Bell and Cant at Gray&apos;s Inn Road.Although the communist character of the NationalI Unemployed Workers1 Commit tee Movement has been frequently indicated in these reports, interest attaches to thet corroboration provided by the following extracts fromproofs received this week: j 1*     Statement made by the Communist chief marshal of the Northern contingents to a secretary of a provincialbranch/
branch of the Communist party on November 23rd:&quot;I am very pleased I decided to take part in the great Hunger Trek to London.   Wc have done more propaganda by this march in 21 days than we could have done in 21 years through the usual channels.   And after all, propaganda and not alleviation of the terrible sufferings of&quot;TEe masses is our primary object.&quot;2.     On November 26th, Thomas Bright said at a meetingof the Communist Party in the Bull Ring, Birmingham:^Wo of the Communist Party are urging the leaders of the National Unemployed &quot;movement&apos; &apos;t&apos;o&quot; make a&quot; stand&apos;.     Your ^^^^^^^^he^^^e^^^jjjou t&amp;at the leaders ofi thaT&quot;Movement are Communisis. &quot;US course they are.&apos;      It is only members&apos; of ihe Communist Ptvriy who have the guts to make the fight. We realised some time ago that you were afraid of joining the Communist Party, therefore we commenced the National Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee Movement and the unemployed flocked into it in their hundreds. Therefore, comrades, the fight that is going to be made in the city which is the centre of wealth for this country is the fight of the Cormaunist Party against the Powers that be...   If you don&apos;1; want to go on the march as a communist then adopt the other name, that is as a member of the National Unemployed workers&apos; Committee.&quot;S.     On November 23rd the Scottish organiser of the Communist Party reported to Headquarters regarding the Party membership in Scotland:w3here is a most magnificent field to recruit from in the unemployed movement.    The le&amp;deruihip and domination of the unemployed movement remains for the most part in our hands.&quot;The extent to which the National Unemployed Workors&apos;Committee Movement represents the great mass of theunemployed may be gauged from the fact that one of their members said in the Bull King, Birmingham, on November 24th:&quot;I am ashamed to say we have only 34 members. Fancy 84 members and there is   84, 000 unemployed in this city.&quot;The unemployed marchers continue to hold meetings in various parts of London ana on November 27th organised a procession of sandwichmen which marched down the Strand: in so doing one   of their number, the Rev. T.E. Pickering, obstructed the policeman on point duty, for which offence hewas/
t)   awas bound over at Bow street on the following day in the sumof  5 to be of good behaviour for twelve months,   After his release some 300 unemployed, who had waited outside the PoliceCourt marched to Hyde Park, where a short meeting was held.!2he largest meeting held during the week was in trafalgar square on November 26th:   about 3,000 were present and wereaddressed by the usual speakers, whose remarks were similarto those quoted in last weekT8 report,   The followingresolution was declared oarried unanimously.&quot;This mass meeting of unemployed and employed workers assembled in Trafalgar Square, November 26th, emphatically condemns the attitude of Bonar Law in refusing to meet the elected representatives of the national hunger marchers.   We pledge ourselves to carry on a ceaseless campaign of activities until such time as we have compelled the Premier to grant an interview with the representatives of the Nfuional Hunger Mtmchers.&quot;On November 28th John Harrison and Thomas Henry Fieldingof the Barrow-in-Foxness contingent were charged at GreenwichPolice Court with being guilty, whilst drunk, of disorderlybehaviour at Beptford Broadway:   HarriBon was fines 7/6d. orsentenced to 6 days&apos; imprisonment In default and Fielding 10/-or 7 days.On November 29th, at Highgate Police Couit Ernest Gibson and Arthur Kirkham, unemployed marchers from Wuleali and Manchester respectively, were charged with begging.   Gibson said that when they reached London they found that the organisation was being controlled by communists and not by the genuine unemployed and so they decided to return home.   Gibson1 previous convictions, which Included a term of four yearsr penal servitude were proved:   both men were discharged.SHE BSD INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONSJ.R. Campbell is negotiating with Joseph Msrkevitch of the Lithuanian Printing Co., at Bcllehill for the printing of&quot;The/
&quot;The Worker&quot;:    the suggested terms are  16 for 5,000 copies: lie ike vi ten has also offered to place a small office at CampbellVe disposal for editing work anci states that his machines are t-t present standing idle.S. Lismer has expressed the opinion that the Minority Movement in the coalfields &quot;is n movement in name only at present&quot; and that &quot;it Ik- very evident that some damned hard graft will have still to be put in to get a move along.&quot;THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE!It is reported, on the authority of a single informant,that the Young Communist League has forwarded a report tothe Young Communist International in which it pledges itself:&quot;To support the Irish and Indian rebels and revolutionary organisations In every possible legal and illegal way.&quot;To fight legally and illegally against Militarism, Navalism, the Church of lin^land,  the Roman Catholic Church and the marriage laws.&quot;To assist in giving information about the United Kingdom, and to transmit, legally and illegally, news and intelligence passing to and fro between the various revolutionary centres and organisations.&quot;To form a Labour Defence Council.&quot;To disseminate revolutionary thought amongst the intellectual and official classes.     As a useful means to this end, apparently harmless societies, correspondence circles, etc., of intellectuals of both sexes will be formed.&quot;Tliers is evidence that the Young Communist Leagues in England and America are endeavouring to work in unison.Tiie Young Communist league does not appear to have received as yet the subsidy for which it sent an urgent appeal to Berlin a short time ago and has been forced temporarily to suspend the issue of the &quot;Weekly Bulletin.&quot;  SH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAIN,The execution of Erskine Guilders has &quot;caused very little. stir/
stir among the Irish of Great Britain; oven In extreme Republican circles the feeling is one of indifference. Moderate Irishmen are glad it is over, and look to the future with a much more hopeful feeling.Art 0&apos;Brien is continuing his efforts to keep the London Branches of the Irish SeIf-Dotermination League in existence.   At the McSwiney Commemoration meeting, on October 25th, an appeal was made for all branches to hold similar commemoration meetings, but the response was disappointing;.    (Shis appeal is new being renewed in the form of a typed circular issued from the headquarters of the League.At an Irish Self-Determination Lea^jae District Committee meeting held in Essex Hall, Strand, during the week, a communioation from the newly-formed Irish Republican Organisation in Scotland was read, asking the League to join with them in organising meetings on December 6th repudiating the Articles of Agreement, and on January 21st in commemoration of the Declaration of Irish Independence:&quot;   a reply was sent promising hearty support and instructions were despatched to branches accordingly.At a meeting of the Roger Casement Sinn Fein Club at 84, Bl&amp;ckfriars Koad on November 23rd, Mr. Saklatvala, M.P., lectured on &quot;Amritsar and its lessons&quot;.   During his address he dealt largely with the Irish situation and advised the Irieh here to form a Republican Labour Party.   When he referred, in bantering tones, to the meeting between Mr. Bonar Law and Mr- Cosgrave, there were cries of &quot;shoot them&quot;. Art OrBrien was not quite pleased with some of the references to Ireland, nevertheless he told one of his friends he Is prepared to Join forces with Saklatvala so as to do the maximum of injury to the British Empire.0.&quot;j. November 25th 0&apos;Brien had an interviewtfith/
S&amp;klatvala and Newbold in order to arrange for them to move the rejection&apos; of the Irish Free State Constitution Bill in the House of Commons*It is known to his friends that 0TBrien is worried over financial matters and the assumption is that the proceedings in the Dublin Courts to compel him to render an account of money in hand is troubling hinuEamon Donnelly, Director of organisation, is said to be dissatisfied with the way Robinson conducts matters in Glasgow and suggests Robinson should confine his activities to the Irish Republican Army side of the movement leaving Duggan and Hutchinson to conduct the political side,.    Persons arrested for political offences, Donnelly suggests should refuse to recognise the Court and no defence should be set up.   Any assistance given by the organisation should bo confined to the dependents of the men arrested.A meeting protesting against the imprisonment of Mary McSwiney was held outside Ss. AndrewTs Cathedral, Glasgow, on November 26th.    Short speeches were delivered by Tom Donnelly, Setimus Duggan and Einehley       A resolutionprotesting against the inhuman action of the Free State Authorities Is executing Frskine Childers and the continued imprisonment of Mary McSwiney was passed.    Copies were ordered to be sent to America and other countries and to the British labour party.    Damon Donnelly visited many of the Republican Halls in Glasgow on November 25th, and had special resolutions passed pledging support to the Republic.    Copies of these nave been taken by Donnelly to de Valera.
