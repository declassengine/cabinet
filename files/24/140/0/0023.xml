The estimated cost incurred by the Committee up to the date of this interim report is  120 15s. Oct., of which  4 15s. Od. is the estimated cost of printing and publishing the r-eport.Ministry of Health,Whitehall, S.W.I.19th October, 1922.The Eight Hon. Sir Alfred Mond, Bart., M.P. Sir,On the 25th July, 1922, we were appointed by yourself and the Bight Honourable Robert Munro, K.G., M.P., to be a Committee with the following terms of reference : To consider the operation of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest, &amp;c. (Restrictions) Act, and to advise &quot; what steps should be taken to continue or amend that &quot; Act.&quot;We were also requested to furnish, if possible, an interim report on the general question of the continuance or discontinu-ance of the main principles of the present Act in time for sub-mission to Parliament during the Autumn Session.We held our first meeting on the 2nd August, at which was discussed, among other things, what steps could best be taken, in view of the holiday season impending and the consequent diffi-cnlties in arranging for sittings and for hearing evidence, to prosecute such inquiries as would facilitate the submission of an interim report.It was decided to send out to a selected list of associations and bodies, which might be expected to have special knowledge of the questions at issue, a carefully devised Questionnaire form. This Questionnaire form consisted of 19 questions covering all the main points of difficulty and controversy which the correspondence received by the Ministry of Health had already shown to exist. The associations and bodies to whom it was sent were asked to treat these questions as the headings under which to summarise the evidence they wished to submit, and they were further asked to return their answers together with any statistical information in their possession by the beginning of September. In practically every case the Committee has received a reply to this request, and in most cases the reply takes the form of an elaborate state-ment of the experience of the body in question, and of the reforms suggested to meet the difficulties which have arisen.We have received similar elaborate replies from other associa-tions not directly invited by the Committee to furnish these statements.We are at the moment in possession of some 76 replies to this Questionnaire form dealing at length with practically every aspect of the problem from all points of view.
The replies received from all sources may be summarised from the point of view of the association making the reply as follows :  13 Associations of Property Owners. 9 Associations of Tenants. 4. Trades and Labour Councils. 8 Legal Associations.4 Technical Associations   (Surveyors,  Estate Agents&apos;  In-stitutes, &amp;c.).2 Government Departments.I Housing and Town Planning Association. 11 Local Authorities and similar bodies. 11 Trade Associations (including Building Societies). 12 Individuals or Firms (mainly Solicitors).1 Citizens&apos; Association.A careful and detailed summary of the bulk of these- 76 replies has been in the possession of all members for some time.We are also in possession of the views of the majority of the County Court Judges on several of the more contentious points of the Act, these views having been elicited by a circular sent out by our colleague, His Honour Judge Sir Edward Bray.In addition to the above-mentioned sources of information, we have received in answer to the published request of the Committee about 3,100 letters from various sources, including in many cases elaborate statements of experience by Estate Agents, Solicitors, Private Builders, Tenants&apos; Associations and individual Tenants or Property Owners.A full and detailed summary of the first 2,500 of these letters has been in the hands of the Committee for some weeks.You will, therefore, see that when we resumed our sittings on the 16th October we were in possession of a mass of evidence in itself practically sufficient to enable us to arrive at definite con-clusions on some of the main points at issue. We have, however, supplemented our information by oral examination of witnesses representing the views of. landlords and of tenants. We have heard evidence from the following bodies : (1) The  National Federation  of   Property  Owners   a-nd Ratepayers, represented by  Mr. E. J. Churchman, J. P. Mr. A. J. Williams. Alderman Cheverton-Brown. (2) The Property Owners&apos; Protection Association, repre-sented by Mr. Edwin Evans, J.P., L.C.C. (3) The National  Federation of   Property   Owners   and Factors of Scotland, represented by  Mr. William Murray Crone, F.S.I. Mr. William Forrest.   (Lord Dean of the Guild of edinburgh.) Mr. Stewart (the Secretary) Mr. Burns Petrie.
(4) The War Bents League, represented by  Mr. Dan Bider.(5) A conference of Owners of Industrial Dwellings, repre-sented. by Mr. Arthur Moore.&apos; (6) The Association of Women House Property Managers, represented by The Lady Selborne, and Mrs. &quot;Vernon Ley. (7)   The Scottish Labour Housing Association, represented by-Mr. Joseph. Sullivan, J.P. In view of the wide-spread anxiety regarding the future of the Act, we have thought it best not to wait until we might be in a position to furnish a more detailed report, but to inform you at once of certain definite conclusions at which we have arrived.We are of opinion that protection of tenants against eviction and unreasonable increases of rent, as afforded by the Increase of Bent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920, should not be withdrawn when that Act expires in June, 1923.We have, however, formed the opinion that in future legislation regard must be had to certain matters in the light of experience of the present Act. Among these are the questions of the further period of protection, of sub-tenancies, of the eviction of proved undesirable tenants, and of the owners of one house required bond fide for the owners occupation.Upon these and other matters time has not afforded us the opportunity of making precise recommendations.Some of our members desire for the present to reserve their judgment upon the point whether or not the upper rental limits of the houses to which the present Act applies should remain unaltered.We desire to express high appreciation of the value of the services rendered by our Secretary, Mr. H. H. George, M.C. Upon him has fallen the chief burden of the mass of our corres-pondence, and of the compilation of the. elaborate summaries of evidence. The efficiency with which he has carried out these onerous duties has greatly facilitated our task.We are, Sir,Your obedient Servants, (Rgd.)      Henry Norman (Chairman) Alexander Shaw . D. Watts Morgan. Harry Barnes. Aubrey V. Svmonds. Edward Bray. Theodore Chambers . Thomas White. P. B. Moodie. Duncan M. Graham.(Sgd.)      H. H. George (Secretary).
We regret that we are unable to sign this report. While the Committee has had before it a great volume of written evidence, we do not feel that such evidence can replace the oral examination of witnesses, especially in view of its very conflicting character. To this the Committee has not, in our view, been able to devote sufficient time to afford a basis for a decision on such an important matter.We believe that the wide-spread anxiety regarding the future of the Act would have made an interim report desirable not later than the middle of November, but we do not think that the action of a Committee like ours should be influenced by other considerations, however proper in themselves, and we therefore feel obliged to reserve our opinion pending the further proceedings of the Committee.I regret that I cannot concur in the recommeinda.tion of the Committee&apos; that the Act should not be allowed to lapse on its date of expiry in 1923. In my opinion the Act should be allowed to lapse. But if the protection afforded by the Act is to be con-tinued, then, in my opinion, material amendments must be made upon the present Act.(Sgd.)Eustace Percy. G. C. H. Wheleb.(Sgd.)A. S. D. Thomson.(89416-18).  Wt. 13313-396a/938   2000  11/22  H. St.   G 35
