A. S.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. * -    22nd November, 1922.
WAR CHARGES (VALIDITY) BILL. HOP CONTROL CHARGES.During the war brewing was severely restricted and the acreage under hops greatly curtailed by Order.   It became advisable in 1917 to set up the Hop Control for the purpose of ensuring an equitable distribution of hops at a fair price. Under Section 4 of the Ministry of Pood (Continuance) Act, 1920, the control will be continued up tc August 1925. The Hop Controller buys up annually the sentire English crop at a price based on an average cost of production and allowing a fair profit to the grower, and sells it to brewers at a price which includes the cost of administrative expenses.   To this there can be no objection, and no question is raised in connection with the handling of the English crop.. To preserve the Control, however, foreign imports were prohibited except under license issued by the Hop Controller.   For this license a fee at the rate of 5/- a cwt. was levied, In respect of which an aggregate sum amounting to  222,000 was received from the commencement of the Control In 1917 to.July, 1922.     This fee has now been abandoned, as from August last, in respect of consignments of foreign hops, when it was no longer possible to defend the validity of the charge, but it Is desired to obtain parliamentary sanction in respect of tho fees levied in the past..
