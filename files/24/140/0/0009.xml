[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government!Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1922.SECRET.CP. 4309.THE PROBLEM OF CONTINUED OCCUPATION OF, OR withdrawal from, IRAQ.I FORWARD a memorandum by the Air Staff on the military aspects of a curtailment of our commitments in Iraq, which I consider should be read in con-junction with the Memorandum (CP. 4303) on the political aspects circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.S. H.,Secretary of State for Air.Air Ministry, November 16, 1922.Memorandum by the Air Staff.1. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has circulated to the Cabinet a Memorandum (CP. 4303) on the political aspects of the evacuation of Mosul and its restoration to the Turks. On page 2 of this memorandum there is a paragraph which reads : &apos;&apos; It is understood that the Air Ministry y^ho are now responsible for the defence of Iraq consider that this plaee would be untenable on strategic grounds o^iHaHi Mosul passes to the Turks aftd it would mean leaving Baghdad.&quot;The Air Staff feel it desirable to expand this statement and to supply Flis Majesty&apos;s Government with a statement of what in their view are the military issues involved in the question (I) of evacuation from Mosul, and (II) of the further withdrawal from Baghdad to Basra which by necessity or by choice may be consequent on that evacuation.I. Evacuation of Mosul.(a.) The withdrawal from Mosul could be effected without immediate risk of military disaster as the garrison is small and the full power of the air squadrons at Baghdad would be available to cover the movement.(b.) The military situation would be unfavourably affected through the unrest and lack of confidence thereby created in the country generally. The withdrawal would have to be carried out by stages beginning with the withdrawal of posts north of Mosul held by levies. In view of the nature of the Turkish demands and the manner in which they are put forward, the withdrawal will be taken through the. length and breadth of Iraq as a sign of weakness and proof of indecision on the whole policy of occupation.(c.) The military problem will be complicated by the large number of Christian refugees who, as the Colonial Office point out, would come on our hands if the Mosul vilayet is given back to the Turks.The conclusions of the Air Staff are : The evacuation of Mosul would not neces-sarily imply a withdrawal also from Baghdad, but it would be necessary to provide an increased garrison at Baghdad and on the lines of communication south of that place, as a result of the lack of confidence engendered by the evacuation and of the fact that the Turks with a more southerly frontier would be a greater danger to our main positions.[9100]
ii.: -Withdrawal from Baghdad to Busra.A decision to withdraw not only from Mosul, but also from Baghdad, and to concentrate British forces on a position covering Basra and capable of supporting the Anglo-Persian oil-field in Arabistan, would probably permit of a considerable reduction in the total numbers of the garrison. Apart, however, from the political aspects of withdrawal, certain military considerations are involved in a a withdrawal under present conditions.(a.) Withdrawal from Baghdad, as the final stage in a cumulative process of retirement from all positions, beginning north of Mosul and extending over several weeks or months, would be a considerable military undertaking. The railway may be cut and 500 miles of river alone relied upon. It is not practicable to ignore the possibility of unrest among the Tigris Valley tribes, as the whole country will have been aroused by the withdrawal from Mosul. It would be necessary, therefore, to allow for the possibility of additional reinforcements being needed to safeguard lines of communication during the period of withdrawal.(&amp;.) Evacuation under present conditions will not be a question of the with-drawal of a compact force consisting mainly of trained military personnel. It would be necessary to evacuate in addition to the troops some 5,000 British subjects, including Indian works^- personnel, &amp;c, at present in Iraq. Provision would presumably also have to be made for the Christian refugees from the Mosul vilayet.(c.) Nor can the position of the local levies and of the loyal portions of the native population be disregarded Any expectation on their part of evacuation by us would be a strong inducement to them to save themselves by turning against us.(d.) It would be necessary to destroy or leave behind large stocks of supplies, equipment and military works. The present arrangements are governed by the Cabinet decision of the 18th August, 1921, which authorised the establishment of a strong fortified site at Hinaidi (Baghdad) where the major portion of the garrison should be stationed, including six squadrons of the Royal Air Force. In pursuance of this decision the construction of the defended cantonment has been pressed on with, large supplies of valuable aeronautical material have been accumulated, and in addition a six months&apos; reserve of foodstuffs for the whole of the garrison is being held.To bring all this material away as part of a scheme of evacuation would be impossible; to leave it behind or to destroy it would strike heavily at our prestige, and would add to the military risks of the evacuation.The Air Staff do not wish to be understood as suggesting that the military difficulties, which for the above reasons attach in their view to evacuating under present conditions, are permanent in nature. Withdrawal of the British forces by gradual stages to the point of complete evacuation, on the basis of a progressive stability of the political regime in Iraq and increasing efficiency of the local forces, should, from the military and aerial aspect, present no diflkmlties. To that end a firm peace with Turkey would greatly contribute, if reasonable time is given^ for the results of the peace to mature and for the present Government of Iraq to make good. Some further reductions to the garrison should, indeed, be immediately practi-cable if a satisfactory peace is obtained, as it has been the Turkish situation which has entailed the discontinuance of the reductions made in 1921.The Air Staff desire to make it clear that the above views have been formulated without express reference to the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq. The latest reports from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Colonial Office bear emphatic testimony to the success attained by the use of air squadrons on the northern frontier of Iraq, and the Air Staff gather from letters and telegrams received from the Air Officer Commanding that he is confident in his ability, with the resources at his disposal, to meet any scale of enemy, attack which would be possible on the assumption that the Turks&apos; primary objectives would be on their European front. This being so, the Air Staff consider that it would be unfair to ask the Air Officer Commanding to advise upon the method of evacuation unless, and until, it is clear that a policy of with-drawal is within measurable distance of being adopted, all the more so because any dissemination in Iraq of news that evacuation is being officially considered can only add to the difficulties of the British representatives there.Air Staff, November 16, 1922.
