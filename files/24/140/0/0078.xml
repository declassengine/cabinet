Printed fur the Cabinet.      December .1922;CABINET.1 circulate for my colleagues&apos;information the following appreciation of the political outlook in India which the Government of India have forwarded to me by telegram. The report brings under review a long series of events and contains a reasoned statement of the Government of lndia&apos;s policy in the past on whichT do not feel concerned to comment. As regards the future, the Government, of InchVs anticipations will, I hope, be justified, by the event ; but at the same time they appear to reflect a mood of optimism which I think it would be wise to regard with a. certain degree of caution.PEEL28th December 1922.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India., dated 6th December 1922.In view of publication of Report of Civil Disobedience Committee, and of discussions now taking place regarding its proposals, as also of the opening of new. Parliament, we think an appreciation by us of the present position of. non-co-operation movement, and of political outlook, may be of assistance. In the telegrams published in the White Paper issued in April last, we traced the genesis and the history of the movement down to the arrest of Gandhi; and in our telegram of 7th June we described the subsequent developments up to that date, and indicated the conclusions which material then available appeared to us to warrant. A further period of nearly six months has since elapsed, and we are now in a better position to estimate significance and character of the movement, to review its evolution and the policy adopted by us in regard thereto, and to forecast its future. For this purpose wcshall-not set out in detail the events already described in White Paper telegrams, but shall confine ourselves to the more salient aspects and considerations. *2. The non-co-operation movement was the outcome of a combination, of causes. The Morley-Minto Reforms had, for the moment, satisfied educated Indian opinion,, but. as time went on, disappointment at the smallness of the results achieved began, to-appear, and the demand for a larger measure of self-government, in any case eventually inevitable, was greatly accelerated and intensified by the war, and by stimulus to national aspirations which the declarations of the Allies supplied. As the struggle dragged on its course, the enthusiasm manifested, at its outbreak- waned, the irritation engendered by prolonged strain aroused suspicion and distrust, and fears were widely entertained that, after all her sacrifices, India, in the end, when England had secured her own aims, would be left in the lurch. The declaration of August 1917 was intended to allay these apprehensions, but was only partially successful in this respect, and the Montagu-Ghelmsford Report, when published in the: following year, met with a mixed reception, and was condemned by many as inadequate and unsatisfactory. Had it been possible to give immediate effect to its recommendations it is highly improbable that any large section would have stood aloof! from the elections. But the interval between its appearance and the passing of the Act:of .1919 witnessed two developments which profoundly stirred Indian feeling,, namely, the Punjab disturbances and their seqvelce, and the bitter resentment of, the Mohammedans over the treatment of Turkey ; further, high prices and general economic pressure began to get more acute. Even so, the issue was for a long time in doubt, and the final adoption by Congress of the policy of non-co-operation was largely determined by the personal influence of Mr. Gandhi and the remarkable appeal which his reputation for asceticism arid sacrifice made to Indian mind.3. The non-co-operationist campaign was thus the result of a concatenation of circumstances, of which some of the most important were of a temporary and exceptional character, and  our policy towards it has been largely shaped  and 5982      100   12.22SECRET.CP. 4378.;
determined ;lay this consideration. The fundamental problem, as we saw it, was to remove-distrust of the m.otives*and alms ot the British Government,&apos;which-underlay--and ; inspiretl,,the movement. Time Itself, we believed, - would- tend ^gradually. ,to mitigate the, resentment and, the irritation which exceptional: conditions had-given rise; to, but; only on the condition that, confidence in British, Government -were-restored-.; We spared,: therefore, no effort to bring home to Indian opinion the reality of the reforms and our determination to give them every chance of success, and we sought, by every means in our power, to reassure Mohammedan feeling, and to allay the bitterness left behind by the Punjab disturbances. At the same time, we were deeply impressed by the necessity, if these endeavours were to be crowned with success, of carrying with us Indian opinion in the measures which we employed in dealing with the non-co-operationist agitation. This agitation had its origin in feelings, sentiments and aspirations, which to some extent, were shared too by its opponents, the moderates. Its goal, the attainment of swaraj, was also theirs ; they too had been deeply affected by events in the Punjab, and the Mohammedans amongst them were in full sympathy with the aim; though not with the methods, of the Khilafat movement. While We never lost sight of paramount necessity for the maintenance of law and order, we were convinced that, in the long run, a policy combining patience, conciliation, and the firm suppression of violence and disorder would eventually defeat a movement whose impracticable character was realised by all sensible men. Accordingly, whilst, as the campaign developed, the stringency of our counter-measures increased, we refrained, throughout 1921, from prosecuting those of its leaders, and in particular Mr. Gandhi, who themselves were not guilty of direct incitement to violence.4. Given that we were able to carry Indian opinion with us in the action taken, we anticipated that, nou-co-operationist campaign would end in one of two ways : either, as a result of. its inherent weakness, the incapacity of its leaders to fulfil their promises, and excesses to which it inevitably led, it would gradually collapse, or its leaders would be compelled to bring into operation the last item in its programme, and to proclaim mass civil disobedience,1 in which event we were confident that we should iind a considerable measure of support in whatever steps, including arrest of Mr. Gandhi, we found it necessary to take. The non-co-operationist movement was based on a definite programme, which sought to bring about the complete paralysis of the Government by withdrawing co-operation from one sphere after another. Its leader had proclaimed that swaraj&quot; would undoubtedly be attained thereby, and had even fixed the.date by which this consummation was to be reached, and it seemed to us, therefore, inevitable that, sooner or later, he would be faced with the alternative of seeing the movement crumble away, as his followers realised his failure to carry out his undertakings, or of trying conclusions with the Government on an issue on which Government could count on sufficient support, if it brought all its resources into use.5. Despite the failure of various items of his programme, such as the boycott of schools and of the Councils, and the surrender by lawyers of their practice, the influence and fame of Gandhi continued to grow throughout 1921. In December of that year all executive authority was vested in him by Congress, and in January 1922, when he contemptuously rejected the advice of various politicians who suggested a conference with Government, his prestige stood at its highest. His followers were sustained by the belief that the final phase of the struggle with the Government was at hand, and that its victorious termination might confidently be expected. Even the Moderates, who&apos; haemal-ways been impressed by his personality, were, at the moment, to a large extent in sympathy with his attacks on the Government, in connection with measures taken against the volunteers. Nevertheless, the end was in sight. His attempts to bring about an ioipasxe, by filling the jails with prisoners convicted under Part 2 of tho Criminal Law Amendment Act, had failed The supply of volunteers began to fall off, and the growing impatience of his followers, who had been promised swaraj within a year, compelled him to issue his manifesto of the 4th February, in which, should the Government decline to accept impossible conditions formulated by him, he announced las intention of launching mass civil disobedience. The reply of the Government left no doubt as&apos;to their readiness to accept the challenge, and at the last moment Gandhi drew back, on the plea that affair at Chauri Chaura had shown that the country was not, ready for mass civildisobedience.6. The arrest of Gandhi within a few weeks of the Bardoli Resolutions, by which mass civil disobedience was indefinitely postponed, had lent colour to the suggestion, that the collapse of the non-co-operation movement was the consequence thereof.
&quot;This-, however; is, in our judgment, a misreading-of the sequence of ;evehhw&apos;:-&quot;The:&apos;:!;-arrest of Gandhi, and the removal of his disturbing influence, &apos; -was a necessary and important step, but the decline, both of the non-co-operation movement\&apos;, and &quot; of the-prestige of its leaders, dates, not from the-arrest, but;fi-pm&quot; the &quot;-issue&apos;of thef;i Bardoli. Resolutions, which left agitation without airy clearly defined &apos;&apos;an d intellig:iblo: objective.   From that moment disorganisation and disintegration set in; enthusiasm, evaporated ; disillusionment and discouragement prevailed in the ranks of the party ;-and the influence of Gandhi, which, at the date of the Bardoli Resolutions, stood, as we have already observed, at its&apos; highest, received a blow so immediate and profound that his arrest did not provoke a single demonstration ; at the same time, of course, it must be noted that the process of disintegration was very materially assisted by the fact that many of Gandhi s most active lieutenants had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment Tinder the Criminal Law.7. After the initial period of  despair and confusion following the   Bardoli. Resolutions, attempts were made by non-co-operators to reconstruct programme on; lines that would appeal to popular imagination, but the unity of the party had been vitally impaired ;   no effective substitute could be devised for  original  Gandhi-programme, with its clearly defined objective,, and eventually the plan was adopted of appointing the Civil Disobedience Committee, partly with the object of checking .the growing disintegration of  the party and partly in the hope that Committee . a night be able to formulate some plan, which would, rally the party to its support and -again enlist the enthusiasm of the masses.   The publication, after many postpone-ments, of the report has dissipated all such hopes, and marks probably another stage in the decline of the whole movement.   The report is unanimous.   In it, mass civil disobedience, the impossibility of which is recognised by all shades of extremist opinion, the boycott of schools and of courts, is practically abandoned, and half the Committee, including Mr-.-C. R. Das and Moti Lai Nehru, two of the ablest leaders in the Congress camp, have recommended that party should contest the elections and capture Councils.   It is not probable that so complete a voile face will he accepted at once.   The indications, so far, are that the opponents of the proposals, made up of men who have still a lingering loyalty to Mr. Gandhi ; of men who cannot stomach so open a confession of failure ; members of rank and file who fear that their own importance will suffer thereby, and of a section in Bengal which has been infected by Bolshevik propaganda, will have a majority at the Gay a Congress meeting.   But the movement in favour of entry into the Councils is now too strong to be suppressed, and, in the absence of any constructive alternative proposal, is sure to gather volume and momentum as the time for the elections draws near,    [t is an open secret that, if the views of its supporters are rejected at coming Congress, they will seek, a reversal of the decision at some later date, and the probability is that permission to contest elections will be accorded.8. The Khilafat agitation, in the meantime, has undergone a parallel and almost equally marked decline. In part this has been due to collapse (if the non-co-operationist movement, which, whilst drawing, from the Mohammedans much of its fighting elements, in its turn has worked hard to inflame Mohammedan feeling, to encourage an intransigent attitude, and to sow mistrust of British policy ; partly also to suspicions as to motives of Hindus, and partly to the growing realisation by Mohammedans that the Government of India have made earnest efforts to support their more reasonable claims, and, of late, to the belief that the Mohammedan demands are now likely to be satisfactorily met. The pro-Turkish sentiment is still strong, but if the Conference now sitting at Lausanne is brought to a successful conclusion, there is some hope we shall reach the end of an agitation which has for a number of years caused us anxietje9. Concomitantly with these developments, there has been a marked improvement in the general attitude of the masses of the population. This change has been greatly facilitated by the good harvests and lower prices, hut, in the main, has been due to the steady enforcement of the law by the provincial Governments. The strict realisation, as in Assam and Madras, of the Government dues in those areas in which organised attempts to withhold revenue were made, and, above all, to the manifest, failure of the non-co-operators to fulfil their promises, which have dissipated the-illusions fostered by the extremists, helped to restore the prestige of the Government. More friendly relations between the cultivators-and the district officers have now been, -or are rapidly being, re-established.
&apos;.-   10. Conditions among.labourers in the industrial areas are also somewhat better-There is among the extremists, more particularly in Bengal, a section which has been, influenced by the Bolshevik literature imported, despite constant iutercep.tiens, in the-post, into India, and by its policy of &quot; rousing the masses.&quot;   This, section will. doubtless endeavour to stir up trouble in the labour centres, and may even, perhaps,. attempt incitement to outrage ; on the other hand, attempts to promote class bias will arouse the opposition of the well-to-do classes, and labourers themselves will furnish&quot; less responsive material than they might have 18 months or year ago, now that, with falling prices, their real, earnings have been substantially increased.   Until Indian, labour has reached a higher stage of organisation strikes must be expected to be-fairly frequent, but, hitherto, these have never been more than, partial and, when unreasonable, they have been defeated.11. The services have naturally not been unaffected by these changes. Our officers, in particular the district officers, who now, as ever, are the backbone of the administration, have been subject, during the last few years, to an unprecedented strain; their work has in many places been carried on in an atmosphere of racial hostility ; they have been the object of constant and unscrupulous misrepresentations ;. suspicion and unrest were sown among the masses who had previously looked up to them as their protectors. Racial feeling is not so marked, but is still far from extinguished. Misrepresentations are less freely made, but the situation, as regards political conditions generally, has certainly been eased. Disturbances and disorders have, for the moment, ceased, as already observed. The friendly relations with the cultivating classes have been, in a certain measure, restored, and the prestige of the Raj has, to a considerable extent, revived. Vt hilst it would not be true to say that officers are now free from disquietude on the subject of the future, and the developments it may hold, we believe that the discouragement, which 18 months ago was widespread, has greatly diminished, and that, in general, a somewhat more hopeful view now obtains.12. The Moderates have naturally found in the collapse of the non-co-operation-movement the best confirmation of the soundness of their own policy, and their organs: in Press have not failed to emphasise the moral. They are somewhat perturbed in regard to the attitude in England upon Indian affairs, and have been inclined, to interpret the resignation of Mr. Montagu, the late Prime Ministers speech on the services, and the certification of the Bill for the Protection of Princes, as successive indications of a change in English opinion, inimical to the early realisation of constitutional developments, which they regard as desirable and necessary. It may he doubted, however, if they really believe that the Reforms are in any actual danger, or have any doubt that further progress towards self-government can be attained on constitutional lines.13. As we read the situation, for the present the outlook is thus more favourable than it has been at any time during the last three years. It is far from our intention to suggest that there are no clouds on the horizon. The financial position is full of difficulty, and the complete economic recovery of India depends on world conditions which admit only of slow and very gradual amelioration. The Sikh difficulty still awaits a permanent settlement, and, -until this has been attained, will continue to be a source of anxiety. The revival of the anarchical movement in Bengal is a factor to be reckoned with. More important, because more abiding in its operation, than any such temporary difficulties, is the change which the last six or seven years have produced in the general, feeling of Indians. Racial hostility is perhaps less acute, and is certainly less obtrusive, than it was a year ago, but we still have to contend with the tendency to subject the intentions of Government to criticism tinged with suspicion. We are fully conscious of the difficulties inherent in this situation; nevertheless, when every allowance is made for the impossibility of forecasting coming events, we believe-that we can reasonably look forward in the immediate future, at all events, to a period. :of peaceful progress and development.
