his document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.CABINET.Imperial Economic Conference.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesICRciilp.4332At the wish of the Prime Minister I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the draft of a message which he proposes to have telegraphed to the Dominion Prime Ministers and to the Government of India, inviting a full expression of their views upon the proposal to hold an Imperial Economic Conference in the early part of next year.After consultation with the Prime Minister last week, I arranged with the President of the Board of Trade for the appointment of an Interdepartmental Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith, to study the various aspects of the problem.   The draft is based upon the preliminary survey of the Committee, and has since been revised at a meeting between the First Lord of the Admiralty, the President of the.Board of Trade and myself, at which representatives of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for India were present. .I have arranged with the Prime Minister that, in the absence of any comments at tomorrow&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet, the telegrams will be despatched tomorrow afternoon.(Signed)   DEVONSHIRE.COLONIAL OFFICE,28th November, 1922
Draft Telegram.Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister beginsAs you know my colleagues and I are anxious to help the development of trade within the Empire in any way in our power.   The most promising method of securing this is in our opinion co-operation between the various Governments and we are therefore anxious to take counsel with them.A meeting of the Imperial Conference is due next year, and will, I hope, take place.   But it seems to us that there would be advantage in holding an Imperial&apos; Economic Conference distinct from and in advance of this, which could survey all the possibilities of joint and reciprocal action in the economic sphere.I should be grateful if you would let me know how you would view this suggestion and whether you would be prepared to send representatives to such a Conference if the idea commended itself generally.We have given some orelimina.ry consideration to the scope of an Economic Conference such as we have in mind and our tentative suggestion is that its general reference should be to study the possibilities of co-operation in the development of the resources of the British Empire azid. the strengthening of economic relations between its constituent parts.Among the subjects which suggest themselves as suitable for consideration would be those for the fuller development of natural resources and of inter-Imperial commerce shxppixig and communications generally as well as co-ordination ^ed action for the improvement of technical
technical research and the organisation of economic intelligence;   and also any proposals for the unification of law or practice in the Empire in matters bearing upon trade development e.g. Empire Patents, Bills of Lading, Enforcement of Judgments, &amp;c.   Not the least important aspect of development in this connexion, for some at any rate of the Governments concerned, is that of Oversea Settlement; and the progress up to date of co-operation in this respect on the lines laid down in the resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1921, and the possibilities of further progress, would naturally come under review.Certain organisations for economic co-operation have already been established on an Inter-Imperial basis. The work of such bodies would naturally come up for con-sideration as would also the recocmendations of Conferences and Commissions on special subjects which have met and reported in recent years.The Conference might also tfish to survey certain aspects of the external commercial relations of the Empire.   For example it might think well to consider the question of mutual co-operation amongst the various Grovernments to safeguard their economic interests in relation to foreign countries and any proposals for pro-promoting international arrangements for the more equitable treatment of commerce.   One or two subjects call for consideration as regards both their Imperial and.Inter-national aspects, for example the position of Govern-ment Enterprises as regards taxation and legal liability.We
We should be greatly obliged for full expression of your opinion after you have had time to consider suggestions outlined above and also for your views as to the best time for holding such a Conference if agreed to and as to the number of representatives. Tentatively we suggest that it should take place about April, 1923, and that there should be not more than three delegates from each Government accompanied by the necessary expert advisers.A similar telegram is being sent to the other Prime Ministers and also to India,   We contemplate of course that the Conference should include representa-tion of the interests of the Colonies and Protectorates.
