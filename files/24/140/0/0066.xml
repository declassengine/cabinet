THIS DOgjJMBM IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.OA 3 I -IT E T,REPORT OF THE COMMITTEEON EXPENDiTTJRE (0IV H DEPARTMENTS). MEMORANDUMJY,THE MINISTER OF LABOUR ON THE 1STIMATE3 FOR INDUSTRIAL TRAINING 1983-34,ORET On November 2nd,.  I circulated a memorandum supportingP.a recommendation made by Dr. Macnamara that there should be provided in respect of Industrial Training the sum of 54,691,500 for 1923-84, being the same figure as for&apos;1922-23, instead of the sum of  3,000,000 recommended by the Committee on Expenditure (CP.4288A) .I have considered the question further with particular reference to tile Chancellor rs memorandum of 1st December (CP,4330) as to the prospects of next yearrs budget.    In the circumstances I am prepared to acquiesce in the reduction of the estimate for 19S3-24 to a figure of about  3,000,000, provided that it is clearly understood that the Government must be prepared to face the criticism which will almost .inevitably be made that they are economising at the ex-Service man&apos;.a expense.The report of Sir John Davidson1s   Select committee will no doubt/ come up for discussion in the House next Session. Their expensive proposals for the prolonged retention of dis-abled men in Training Centres would,  if they were adopted, or if anything is done in that directions necessitate increased expenditure which would not be covered by the revised estimate of approximately  3,000,000.Accordingly,  if it is later decided to do anything further on these lines., a supplementary estimate will bo necessary,(Intd)    M. 3.I Ijth. December, 1982 .
