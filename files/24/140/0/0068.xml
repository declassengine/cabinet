Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1928.SECRET.CP. 4368.CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 81.     Period ended December 15, 1922.The number of persons registered at the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed at the 11th December was 1,388,641, a decrease of 1,253 over the previous week.COAL-MINING.The improvement in the Forest of Dean has been maintained, and there are signs of improvement in the Bristol area. The position continues good in the Midlands, but there is no change in the situation in the Yorkshire and Durham coalfields. The Lancashire coalfields show much improvement, while in Scotland a gradual improvement is occurring.   In Wales there has been little change.IRON AND STEEL.The position in the Midlands continues unsettled; while there is no marked change in the situation in the North of England and Wales, there is a steady improvement in Lancashire, and prospects in Scotland are hopeful.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Many large firms have received orders which may result ultimately in the absorption of additional workpeople. The Tyne shows a considerable improvement, and the outlook on the Mersey is hopeful. Employment in Scotland tends to improve.ENGINEERING.While employment continues to be sub-normal generally, there are signs of a slight improvement in the North of England. The situation in the textile and Marine sections in Lancashire is favourable, and prospects are brighter in the motor-engineering section in the Midlands. In Scotland it is expected that trade will improve in the New Year.TEXTILES.Cotton. Depression exists in both Yorkshire and Lancashire, and employment is very intermittent.Hosiery and Woollen Worsted. Trade in the Midlands is normal, but depression in the West Riding of Yorkshire continues. In Scotland, while the hosiery section is good, in the woollen and worsted branch there is a tendency in some districts to start &quot;short time&quot; working.Lace. In the Midlands there is no immediate prospect of any general improvement.Jute. A slight improvement is reported.BUILDING.Employment continues to be generally sub-normal, but there are prospects of slight improvements in the Home Counties, the Midlands and Lancashire.SUMMARY OF UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION.POSITION IN CHIEF INDUSTRIES.
BOOT AND SHOE.Trade is quiet in London and at Norwich. The improvement at Leicester has been maintained, while the position at Stafford is more satisfactory.CLOTHING.Depression continues, but at certain centres some improvement is expected in the New Year.POTTERY.Unemployment in the Staffordshire district continues to be abnormal, and very little improvement is expected before next spring.PAPER AND PRINTING.In the South-Eastern and South-Western Counties there is no improvement to report.TINPLATE.Employment in the Welsh tinplate industry continues good. TRANSPORT.Employment at the London Docks is moderate, but the situation at Bristol and Avonmouth is steadily improving. On the Tyne and Tees the supply of labour exceeds the demand, but on the Mersey, especially at Liverpool, there is a tendency towards improvement. The position is good at Swansea, Barry and Cardiff, but bad at Newport.C. A. MONTAGUE BARLOW, Ministry of Labour.I.-DETAILED UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES.1. General Percentage of Unemployment.[Note. Down to November 1920 the only percentages of unemployment available are those derived from Trade Union returns covering roughly 1,000,000 workers. From November 1920 percentages derived from the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, covering 11,000,000 to 12,000,000 workers, are also available.]Trade Union unemployment at the end of  Percentage.

On the 13th August, 1920, the then Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving&apos;unemployment. This Committee continued to function.till October 1922. The present Government appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee on the 1st November, 1922.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, [9276] b 2
which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants), and the Contributions during the period from the 8th November, 1920, to the 9th December, 1922. 1.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 300,000 men have had emplo&apos;ment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 109,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits Scheme.(C.) Recent Extensions of Remedial Measures.Some of the measures comprised in (B) above are still in operation, e.g., past sanctions of grants by the Unemployed Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport. The Export Credits Scheme continues, and schemes approved under the Trade Facilities Act are in progress.In June 1922. the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transport issued circular letters to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in their respective areas. Approved schemes are assisted by grants made on the same bases as heretofore. In the case of schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of grants already sanctioned are set out below.
In. September .1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circular letters to County Councils (except the London County Council) and Drainage Authorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land drainage which, if approved, might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those applicable in the case of schemes assisted last year. All applications must, however, be received in the case of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1, 1922, and in the case of County Councils (Agricultural Committees) on or before December 16, 1922. Particulars of grants sanctioned and of the number of men employed to date are shown below (see table 6). County Councils were also circulated with regard to schemes for the supply of water to farms, the conditions of assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter, with the exception that the Ministry, instead of advancing the whole cost ot any scheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will make grants to cover part only of the total cost of each scheme. Further circulars, issued to County Councils and Drainage Authorities on the 5th and 6th December respectively, notified the extension of the date up to which applications may be received to the 13th Januarjr, 1923, and invited the submission of additional schemes.In December 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee issued a further circular letter to Local Authorities inviting them to submit schemes suitable for assistance on the basis of 60 per cent, of the Wages Bill, i.e., works the cost of which is normally defrayed out of revenue and not by loan. The conditions under which grants may be sanctioned are substantially the same as those previously in force, except that in the case of Rural Districts the Committee have discretion to allow, where clearly necessary, a modification of the conditions regarding the giving of preference to 75 per cent, ex-service men and the engagement of labour through the Employment Exchanges.On the 30th November,. 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, outlined the manner in which measures taken by the late Government will be continued and extended. The additional sums promised in extension of existing funds are set out below :  Unemployment Grants Committee (for grants on the basis of60 per cent, of Wages Bill) ... ... ... ...        600,000Land Drainage....... ... ... ...        170,000Afforestation ... ... ... ... .......        100,000Acceleration of Government contracts Office of Works    ... ... ... 375,000General Post Office ... ... 946,000-      1,321,000It was also then announced that guarantees under the Trade Facilities Act Scheme would be made available up to  50,000,000 ( 25,000,000 extra); that the I Export Credits Scheme would be extended if necessary; and that the Local ! Authorities concerned would be asked to co-operate in putting in hand the I Manchester-Liverpool Road, which would involve an expenditure of about I  3,000,000, half of it from the Road Fund.On the 12th December, 1922, the Minister of Labour, in the House of Commons, I further announced that, in addition to the acceleration of contracts by the Post 1 Office and Office of Works, previously described, the Admiralty would accelerate S miscellaneous works to a total of about  365,000; whilst the Home Office would puL 1 in hand certain accelerated building work, together with repairs to buildings, I including Police Stations.On the 13th December, 1922, the Forestry Commission issued a press notice to I the effect that forestry grants are now available for the relief of unemployment on I the same general conditions as those applicable to grants made last winter. The 1 :sum set aside for this purpose is, as stated above,  100,000.
