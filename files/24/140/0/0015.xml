In this connection I attach a memorandum on the subject of the situation of our troops in the Irish Free State.(2) There are in Ireland, and also in this country, large stocks of surrendered amis and ammunition of all. sorts and descriptions, some of which were surrendered by the Loyalists. The arms, &amp;c, have been, held in Army custody for the past 2 years at the express request of the Irish Office, and are stored at Dublin and Woolwich at a cost of some  8u a week. I suggest that from. 6th December these arms, &amp;c, shall be handed over to the Government of Southern Ireland.(3) The question of the provision of arms and equipment for Southern Ireland will require revision. In order that the Cabinet may be acquainted with the position at present, I muse refer to the arrangements that have hitherto been in force.Mr. Churchill, after consultation with Mr. Cosgrave, agreed with the latter that the War Office would supply, as far as was possible, all arms, ammunition, &amp;c., on receipt of an order from the Colonial Office ; Mr. Cosgrave further agreed on behalf of the Provisional Government that, in the event of the Imperial authorities hot being able to supply the articles and his being forced to purchase elsewhere, he would at Ohice inform the Colonial Office of all such purchases. The reason for doing this was an excellent one. It was known that arms were being imported into Ireland from abroad for the use of the Rebel Army, and a difficulty arose in regard to stopping them, as it was not known whether the arms so imported were for the Provisional Government or the Rebel Army. The question of payment for articles supplied from Army stocks was to be left over until the final settlement of accounts between the Imperial Government and the Provisional Government. A limit was fixed as to the amouh&apos;t of arms, equipment and ammunition to be supplied from Army stocks-a limit which I regret to say has in many instances been largely exceeded but the War Office was informed by Mr. Churchill that, even if the limit were exceeded, the goods were to fie supplied, provided they were asked for by a fully authorized JDerson at the Colonial Office.When the Provisional Government assumes the status of a Dominion Government,, the question as to this supply being continued must be ; reconsidered. The present arrangement with the Dominion Governments is that the War Office acts as their purchasing agent. Where they cannot supply out of store, they purchase from army contractors, but in each case cash is paid by the Dominion Government interested.It would be quite impossible to treat the Irish Government differently from any other Dominion, unless the Treasury is prepared to lend the Free State funds with which to pay the War Office or contractors for the stores, as otherwise the cost of arms, &amp;c., supplied to Ireland would have to be borne on Army Votes, to which I could hot possibly agree.I wish,, therefore, to ask my colleagues&apos; assent to informing the Provisional Govern -ment that after 6th December they can only be supplied with&apos; warlike stores by the same method as obtains in the case of other, Dominion Governments. I would also ask whether there is to be any limit plabed on the amount which the War Office or other Service Department consents to purchase, acting as agent for the Irish Government.D.2UI November, 1922.(b22/297)   100   11/22   w.o.p.   522
MEMORANDUM ON THE SITUATION OF THE BRITISH garrison in DUBLIN.1. The British garrison maintained to-day in the Free State exclusive of the forts on the south and north coast which by a special clause in the Treaty are to be occupied permanently by British troops, is quartered in Dublin, and consists of 13 infantry battalions.4 batteries of artillery.1 armoured car company. Various ancillary units.This garrison is all concentrated on the western outskirts of the eitv, a location which was selected on account of its suitability for defence by the small force available.In addition, there is one battalion, at Collinstown outside Dublin which will be withdrawn as soon as the Provisional Government are in a position to relieve it by their own troops.2. The regular troops were retained in Dublin under direct instructions from the Cabinet, and it is understood that they are stationed there for the following reasons : (a) To keep a footing in the capital in case it becomes necessary  or a politicalreason (such as assumption of power in Dublin by the Republican section)to resume control of the city. (&amp;) To afford moral support to the Free State Government in their struggle to ratify and afterwards to implement the Treaty in face of opposition by the extremist Republican parties, (c) In case Dublin should be required as one of the bases for military operations ona large scale in Ireland.3. It will be convenient to deal first with the local situation at Dublin (cases (a) and (b) above). The strength of the garrison (about 4,000 rifles) is based partly on the number of units that were available from Great Britain, and partly on the numbers required to hold a small sector of Dublin, and/ maintain its communications with the sea at North Wall until reinforcements could arrive. The troops are, in fact, insufficient to dominate any portion of the city outside the limited area which they actually occupy. Should the Free State Government lose control in Dublin, the population would become actively hostile at once, and it has always been recognized that reinforcements of at least five battalions at peace strength would be required immediately to make the position of the British garrison safe and to secure the line of communication to the sea at North Wall. To- dominate the city completely and make martial law effective in the labyrinth of streets it is calculated that a total of at least two divisions at war strength will be required. There is no likelihood ol a force of this strength being available for this purpose ; and should a serious upheaval occur, there would be no alternative but to withdraw the garrison in circumstances which would probably involve heavy los.*. in material and lives, or to leave them to sustain a siege until reinforcements could be despatched.There was some justification at first in the assumption that the presence of a small British garrison in Dublin would give moral support to the Free State Government in its efforts to secure the ratification of the Treaty, but this object has now been attained. The British troops, however, have throughout been passive spectators of the disorder which has reigned in Dublin and the surrounding country, and it must long ago have become apparent in Ireland that they would be powerless to quell any serious disorder even if they were allowed to intervene. It must also be remembered that the feeling against Great Britain is still such that any active intervention, by British troops in the present internal struggle would convert great numbers of the present adherents of the Free State Government into Republicans and would certainly precipitate a crisis. For a long time past small parties of our soldiers have been, and still are, subjected daily to attack and insult, and although they have shown exemplary forbearance, the strain is such that a serious incident might at any moment bring them into conflict with some section of the population with disastrous consequences. To sum up, the British garrison does not to-day, and cannot in the future, fulfil either of the first two purposes for which it is stationed in Dublin.4. There only remains to consider the last argument for the retention of the troops, stated in paragraph 2 (c).We cannot foresee with any certainty the circumstances in which military operations
In Ireland on a large scale might become necessary, but the following are possible contingencies : (a) If the Irish Free State Government and their armed forces throw the Treaty tothe winds and side openly with the Republicans.(b) If the Irish Free State Government admit their incapacity to deal with thesituation and either ask for or acquiesce in the employment of British troops to restore peace throughout the country.(c) If the Irish Free State, although not acquiescing in the return of the Britishtroops, accept such intervention under protest as inevitable and do not openly throw in their lot with their Republican countrymen.Totally different plans would be required to meet each of these cases ; but it is certain that all would demand the employment of a large and fully-mobilized expedi-tionary force, which it would tax our resources severely to find. Also the principle governing the plan of campaign will probably be the same in each case, namely, to clear the country clean of rebels, district by district. So far as can be foreseen, the centres of rebel resistance will be in the difficult country in the west and south, it is important that these districts should be reached as soon as possible before the enemy have time to organize their positions and plans. Dublin is not well situated as the base for such an operation, and even if it were its occupation would lock up so many troops that the Commander-in-Chiefs hands would be tied for a long time.For these reasons it is probable that we should not desire to use Dublin as a base of operations in the early stages of such a campaign and that our first task, if we were already committed there, wrould be to disentangle our garrison and make a new beginning elsewhere. Operations would most likely be based on Ulster or on some port in the South other than Dublin, or on both simultaneously.5. In view of the above considerations (paragraphs 3 to 4 inclusive) the General Staff consider that not only does the retention of the British troops in Dublin serve no useful purpose, but that their presence provides a constant danger of collision ; they strongly recommend that the garrison be evacuated. The removal of stores and material which must precede the embarkation of troops will take about 19 days to carry out, and the General Staff recommend that instructions (which could be kept secret for a short time if necessary), be issued at once in order ihat evacuation of the troops may begin at the earliest possible date after ratification of the Treaty by Parliament.6. The withdrawal of the British troops in Dublin would probably effect a saving in. Army Estimates for 1923-21 of approximately  450,000.
