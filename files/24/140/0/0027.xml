IBQ A B I H E I,dimaffiloymbira? bbnbpit during the pouagh special, period of theUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACTS.MEMORANDUM BY 1&apos;HE MINISTER off LABOUR.?KET The provision already made with regard to unemployment138 7        benefit in the Fourth Speoial Period, extending from EndNovember, 1922, to 1st July, 1923, ia such that in the great majority of oases benefit may be granted for the full number of 22 weeks - expiring at earliest on 4th April, 1923.In all legitimate oases benefit may be granted for at least IS weeks - expiring at earliest on 24th January, 192a. The number of such oases in whioh the total benefit will be as little as 12 weeks will, however, be small.It is estimated roughly that 80 per oent of those now claiming benefit will be eligible for the full 22 weeks;    that a further 17 per cent will be eligible for between 16 and 22 weeks;    and that only 3 per cent will be eligible for less than 16 weeks.In other words, the number exhausting 16 weeks1 benefit at the end of February, 1923, cannot be more than about 40,000, and the number exhausting 12 weeks&apos;benefit at the end of January, 1923, must be appreciably less, and not more than a few thousands.Until early in the New Year when the present speoial period will have been longer in operation and I have been able to get experience of its working, it is difficult to form a clear view as to the proper policy to be adopted.     I propose early in the new year to oiroulate a memorandum on the policy I should recommend the Cabinet to adopt with regard to both (a)    The position of those who exhaust benefit before the end of the Speoial Period and (b)    She position when the special/period(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY os1 HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S ^VEBNM&amp;otI
period ends on July 1st 1983.     As to (a) it may then prove desirable to make all insured persons eligible for the full 22 weeks - a step that would require legislation.    The cost in additional benefit paid would not be large, probably not more than  2,000,000.     This would not involve any supplement-ary estimate, inasmuch as it does not entail any increase in the amount of contributions paid during the finanoial year, but it would toi course, add anything up to  2,000,000 to the outstanding debt.     The actual borrowing powers of  30,000,000 are sufficient to meet the proposal since the amount at present borrowed is less than  15,000,000.Having regard to the limitations and restrictions which would in the ordinary course be applicable, it is not likely that, if the extension referred to were granted, the Unemploy-ment Fund would be carrying many persons who are not really wage-earners In insured trades.I do not think we are at present in a position to come to a definite decision either for or against an extension of benefit such as that referred to, but during the Debate on the Address the Opposition may urge in argument that - in some (they will say many) cases - benefit will oease at the end of next January, and before the House meets again.       In reply, I think I ought to say -(a) That the Unemployment Insurance Acts are not a relief scheme but an Unemployment Insurance Scheme:(b) That the number of bona fide claimants without benefit at the beginning of February will be very small:(a) hut that the Government will keep a very close watch on the numbers exhausting benefit, and that, should it appear,/in
In tho early part of February, that there may be oases of hardship, we shall at once take into the most careful con-siderntion the question of the steps that may be necessary to deal with the matter and, in particular, whether an extension of benefit should be granted.     I ask for authoxity, therefore, (if I am pressed on the point but not otherwise), to make a statement on these lines,(IntdJ25th November, 1932.Ministry of Labour.
