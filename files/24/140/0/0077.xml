1.     Does the expression &quot;in general such other measures&quot; in paragraph 18 of Annex II to Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles signify any measures other them measures such as &quot;economic and&quot; financial prohibitions and&apos; reprisals&quot; which fall within the limits of the sovereignty of the individual govern-meats?I think paragraph 18 of Annex II to P&amp;rt VIII of the. Treaty contemplates action by an individual government only within itsown jurisdictions! limits.     The fact that each government is given a separate discretion as to the measures it may deem necessary in the circumstances indicates clearly to my mind an intention to restrict &quot;other&apos;measures&quot; to such measures as some within the above description-,8,      Is it for the reparation commission, under paragraph 18 of Annex II to Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles to inter-pret paragraph 18.of that annex?I think it is the duty of the reparations commission to interpret the provisions of paragraph 18.       I see no warrant for the view that there is a distinction for tho purposes of paragraph .12 between interpretation as against the Gorman government-ment and Interpretation as between the allied governments, The explicit language of paragraph 12 in giving the reparations commission authority to interpret the provisions of Par&amp; VIII appears to exclude tho possibility of a rival authority even in a case under paragraph 18 (if such could ever arise) in which the interests of the German government were hot affected.T.W.H, BISKIP.December 28th. 1922,(THIS OTCUMEBT IS TEE PRC-PETTY OF HIS BRIO?AM?IC HaJBSWS GQVEPJMM) .S E C R E T.&quot;* &quot; 0 A.B^I hit0,3?., 4Z7 7. &quot;&apos;&quot;Opinion by the Solicitor-General on the inter-pret&amp;tion of parfeg-ra.pl! 18 of Annex II to Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles.
