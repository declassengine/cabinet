REPORT.WE had before us the Report of Lord Esher&apos;s Committee on the Army in India, the Report of Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee on the Military Requirements of India, the Despatches of the Government of India, No. 11 of the 3rd February, on the Organisation of Military Commands and Staffs in India, and No. 12 of the 3rd February, 1921, on the proposed Organisation and Establishment of the Post-War Army in India, together with Memoranda prepared for our consideration by the Secretary of State for India, the General Staff, the Air Staff and others.2. A Schedule of the documents which were laid before us is printed as an Appendix to this Report, and a map of Wazirisfan is also annexed.3. In view of the mass of documents placed at our disposal bearing upon all aspects of the questions referred to us, we decided that it was unnecessary for us to call witnesses; but we had the advantage of the presence of General Sir Claud Jacob, Chief of the General Staff in India, at all our meetings up to the middle of February.4. We decided to deal first with the constitutional questions raised in the Report of Lord Esher&apos;s Committee on the Army in India, and afterwards to turn our attention to the other questions included in our terms of reference which bear more directly upon the military requirements of India.In the course of our enquiry we have examined into the constitutional questions and questions of general policy that have been referred to us, but we have not attempted to study in detail or to make recommendations regarding various adminis-trative questions, with which we consider that the Government of India must be better qualified to deal.(1.) Th&amp; Extent to which the Financial Resources of India are Capable of Bearing the Burden of a Large Military Expenditure.5. The question of the numbers and composition of the military forces required for the defence of India was reviewed by the Government of India in 1919, 1920, and 1921. On each of these occasions reductions in the strength of the Army were recommended mainly upon financial grounds.6. We are fully alive to the gravity of the financial situation in India, and we are impressed by the imperative need for making all possible retrenchments in every branch of the administration. We think it necessary, however, to observe that it is the primary duty of the Government of India, as of all governments, to make adequate provision for the defence of its territory and the protection of life and property within its boundaries. Moreover, the moment when India has been accorded..a new status within the Empire is not an appropriate time for her to ask for relief from the military obligations, which are inseparable from that status. We cannot, therefore, approve of a reduction of the Army in India to an establishment which would in effect throw upon Great Britain the obligation of providing reinforcements to meet such minor emergencies as must inevitably arise from time to time. On the other hand, the figures which have been put before us have impressed upon us the high proportion which the net military expenditure bears to the net revenue - and we recognise that a point may be reached in any country beyond which military expenditure cannot be increased without creating some of the very dangers it is intended to avert, and that when that point is reached the Civil Govern-ment may have to undertake the responsibility of over-ruling its military advisers.Conclusion.7. While the whole of the resources of Britain will in the future, as in the past, be available to support the Government of India in maintaining British supremacy in India if it is seriously threatened, it is the recognised duty of India to provide for her own defence against external and internal dangers in all but the gravest emergencies.[7984] B 2
(2). The Position of the Government of India vis-a-vis the Imperial Government.8. In the covering letter to their Report, Lord Esher&apos;s Committee stated that they were confronted with evidence of the reluctance of the India Office to relinquish into the hands of the Government of India greater freedom in the administration of the Army, even in cases where this could be done without compromising the adminis-tration of the Army at home or contravening the sound principle of uniformity in military policy. They were strongly of opinion that greater latitude should be allowed to the Governor-General in Council and to the Commander-in-Chief in India in matters affecting internal military administration, in order to secure greater efficiency and especially the greater contentment of the Army in India. They stated that in making that recommendation, they recognised that they should make no proposals which might hereafter prove inconsistent with the gradual approach of India towards a dominion status. They accordingly based their recommendations upon the following principles : (i.) The control of the Government of India of military affairs; (ii.) The giving to the Government of India a voice in questions of imperial defence; and(iii.) Allowing the Imperial General Staff through its Chief to exercise a con-sidered influence on the military policy of the Government of India.9. The recommendations of Lord Esher&apos;s Committee in regard to (iii) and other matters to which we shall refer later have caused serious misgivings in India, and have been subjected to hostile criticism. It has been assumed that the intention was to destroy the individuality of the Army in India and to place it under the control of the War Office.10. In order to dispel the misunderstandings that have arisen as to the nature and scope of their recommendations, we consider it necessary to state that Lord Esher&apos;s Committee did not contemplate any restriction of&apos; the control now exercised by the Governor-General in Council over the Army in India, and they did not intend that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should have anything but consul-tative and advisory functions in regard to Indian military affairs.11. The Secretary of State for India has informed us that since the Government of India. Act of 1919 was brought into operation great changes have been made in the. administration of the India Office in the direction suggested by Lord Eshers Committee; and it is now the practice to send to the Viceroy a weekly budget of important Foreign Office despatches and telegrams and other State papers of Imperial interest.12. We also understand that the Government of India have asked that before the Secretary of State in Council sanctions expenditure of considerable amount, the Government of India should be consulted regarding their ability to provide the necessary means for meeting such expenditure within the budget of the current year. The Secretary of State in Council has agreed, whenever possible, to make the refer-ence desired in any case in which (1.) The additional expenditure in question is of considerable amount, and (2.) The decision contemplated would involve expenditure in the current year.Conclusion.13. (a.) We are opposed to the transfer in any measure to the War Office of the control now exercised by the Governor-General in Council over the Army in India.(b.) We are of opinion that the Government of India should be kept informed of all matters affecting India directly or indirectly, and that the Government of India should be consulted in all cases regarding ability to provide ways and means before any expenditure against the Army Budget is sanctioned.(3.) Relations between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and theArmy in India.14. In the covering letter to their Report, Lord Esher&apos;s Committee recommended that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should be allowed to exercise[7984]
&quot; considered influence &quot; on the military policy of the Government of India and that be should be the sole responsible adviser to the Secretary of State for India. They recommended that he should be authorised; to attend any meeting of the Council of India at which military questions of first importance are discussed.15. These proposals have caused some misunderstanding in India. The Government of India entertain apprehensions that it is intended that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should occupy a position which would admit of his direct interference in Indian Army administration and would enable him to acquire so predominant a voice in deciding military policy as to render the statutory control of the Governor-General in Council over the Army in India purely nominal. We consider that there is no foundation for those apprehensions.Conclusion.16. We share the view of Lord Esher&apos;s Committee that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, with the approval of the Secretary of State for War, should be the supreme military adviser to the Secretary of State for India, as he is to other Ministers of His Majesty&apos;s Government on questions of Imperial strategy. We consider that neither the Chief of the Imperial General Staff nor the Army Council should be allowed to exercise direct influence over the military policy of India or to interfere in regard to the administration of the Army in India. The functions of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in regard to Indian military affairs should be purely advisory and consultative. The suggestions we make below as regards the relationship between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Secretary, Military Department, India Office, will in our opinion serve to ensure the mainten-ance of close relations between these two officers and at the same time to safeguard the constitutional position of the Government of India.(4.): Correspondence between Commander&apos;-in-Chief and Chief of theImperial General Staff.17. Lord Esher&apos;s Committee further laid stress upon the importance of establishing constant and intimate relations between the Commander-in-Chief in India and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in London and between their General Staff officers. They recommended that freedom of communication between the Commander-in-Chief and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should now be established as a permanent right on a regular official basis, subject to the condition that the Secretary of State for India should be kept fully informed of such communications.18. During the war, the rule under which all communications of a military nature between the Commander-in-Chief and the War Office were required to pass through the India Office was relaxed; and the Commander-in-Chief in India was allowed to communicate direct with the War Office in regard to certain matters. Briefly, the conditions under which direct communication between the Commander-in-Chief in India and the War Office was permitted were that such correspondence should extend only to minor matters connected with the administration and organisation of the.troops sent out of India. The control of troops in India and all&apos; questions of policy or principle were expressly reserved to the Secretary of State for India in Council and the Viceroy.19. The Secretary of State in Council has expressed the view that in order to safeguard the constitutional responsibility and control of the Government of India, direct communication should only be allowed subject to the conditions that it should be limited to communications regarding questions of intelligence, training, and preparation for war, and to routine matters such as those connected with the despatch of troops outside India, and minor questions of organisation and equipment. It should not extend to questions of principle or policy..    : &apos;      -
Conclusion.20. While we consider it desirable that the Commander-in-Chief in India and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should keep constant and intimate touch with one another by direct correspondence, it is essential that the constitutional responsibility and control of the Government of India should be adequately safe-guarded. We accordingly suggest that it should be definitely laid down that direct communications between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Commander-in-Chief should be limited to correspondence regarding questions of intelligence, training, and preparations for war, and to routine matters and minor questions of organisation and equipment. It should not extend to questions of principle or policy, but should include any military information required by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to enable him to discharge his duties to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Executive action should not be taken on such corre-spondence. Proposals or final instructions to the Government of India affecting military policy and the distribution, organisation and equipment of Indian troops or their employment outside India must emanate from the Secretary of State for India alone. Copies of all direct communications between the Commander-in-Chief and Chief of the Imperial General Staff should be furnished to the Government of India, the India Office and the War Office.(5.) Appointment of the Commander-imr-Chief.21. Lord Esher&apos;s Committee recommended that the Commander-in-Chief in India should be appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the recommendation of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.22. We consider that this proposal is not acceptable, not only because it is unconstitutional, but also because it has given rise in India to an idea that the War Office desires to assume the control over the Indian Army.Constitutionally, the appointment of Commander-in-Chief is now made by the King on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for War. In actual practice, however, the recommendation to the King is made on the advice of the Cabinet or the Prime Minister, and not on the sole advice of the Secretary of State for War. If any change in the existing procedure is made, we suggest that the recommendation to the King should be made by the Secretary of State for India after consultation with the Secretary of State for War. This change would remove the suspicions current in India with regard to the desire of the War Office to acquire control over the Army in India, and it would also remove the anomaly that the Commander-in-Chief is now the only Member of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council the recommendation for whose appointment is not submitted to the King by the Secretary of State for India.Conclusion.23. We suggest that the practice by which the Commander-in-Chief has always been recommended by the Secretary of State, for War for appointment by the King, after consultation with the Secretary of State for India, might be improved constitutionally if the actual recommendation to the King were made by the Secretary of State for India, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War.(8.) Appointment of Secretary, Military Department, India Office.24. In paragraph 3 of their Report Lord Esher&apos;s Committee recommended : &quot; In order to facilitate what we consider of primary importance, namely, the free and intimate relation between the Commander-in-Chief in India and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and in order that the Secretary of State&apos; for India should also be fully informed upon all questions of military policy affecting India, we recommend that the Secretary in the Military
Department of the India Office should always be an officer with Indian experience, of high military rank, appointed on the recommendation of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff by the Secretary of State for India. It would be convenient and desirable that this officer should be a Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff in order that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff may have the benefit of experienced advice on Indian matters. Furthermore, he should have the right of attending the meetings of the Army Council when questions affecting India are discussed. Although we strongly advocate that questions of administration regarding the Army in India should be mainly settled in India itself, and should only be referred to the India Office under the circumstances which we have previously noted, we are of opinion that the Secretary in the Military Department of the India Office should have attached to his Department two . officers specially conversant with &apos; A &apos; and &apos; Q&apos; questions, in so far as they affect India.&apos;&apos;25. The Secretary, Military Department, India Office, is from day to day the adviser of the Secretary of State for India on strategic and administrative questions affecting the Army in India. As regards the suggestion that he should be made an extraordinary Member of the Army Council, we understand that the Army Council does not normally discuss in Council strategic questions, but only administrative ques-tions affecting more than one Department of the War Office. Administrative questions affecting the British Army in India no doubt come under discussion; but we under-stand that the Army Council would raise objections to the presence of a representative of the India Office when questions at issue between the War Office and the Govern-ment of India are being discussed. In these circumstances we do- not support the suggestion that the Secretary, Military Department, India Office, should be an extra-ordinary Member of the Army Council.26. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and not the Army Council is the sole adviser of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Secretary of State for War on strategic matters, and we have stated in paragraph 16 above that we consider that he should be, with &apos; the authority of the Secretary of State for War, the ultimate and sole adviser of the Secretary of State for India on questions of Imperial strategy. There are, however, local strategic questions, -such as questions relating to the frontier of India in regard to which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff might not be so well qualified to advise as an officer of Indian experience holding the post of Secretary, Military Department, India Office, and we recommend that the principle should be established that the Secretary, Military Department, should be the adviser of the Secretary of State for India on such questions.We realise that there are difficulties in differentiating between imperial strategic questions in regard to which the advice of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should be sought, and purely Indian questions in regard to which the Secretary, Military Department, should be adviser to the Secretary of State; but we think that,&apos; in practice, no difficulty should arise. The recent Moplah rebellion, for example, was a purely Indian question in regard to which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff naturally did not intervene. Similarly, in the case of an expedition on the North-West Frontier, the military authorities in India would be the primary advisers; and the Secretary, Military Department, India Office, would be the adviser of the Secretary of State. But if the operations widened in scope, or the outbreak of war with Afghanistan appeared imminent, and reinforcements: from England were likely to be required, the advice of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff would naturally be sought. The essential condition is that the Chief of. the Imperial General Staff should be immediately informed of developments which may lead to a situation in which imperial interests would be affected. The Secretary, Military Department, will thus in effect perform the functions of a Deputy to the Chief of the.Imperial General Staff; but in order to avoid the risk of misunder-standings arising in India in regard to his position we consider that he should not be given the title of Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff. We note that that appointment of Secretary, Military Department, India Office, has always been held by an officer of the Indian Army, and we assume that unless some special reason exists to the contrary it would in future always be held by an officer of the Indian Army.27. In the preceding paragraphs we have laid emphasis on the need for ensuring that the Secretary, Military Department, India Office, shall maintain close relations
Department of the India Office should always be an officer with Indian experience, of high military rank, appointed on the recommendation of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff by the Secretary of State for India.

We note that that appointment of Secretary, Military Department, India Office, has always been held by an officer of the Indian Army, and we assume that unless some special reason exists to the contrary it would in future always be held by an officer of the Indian Army.27. In the preceding paragraphs we have laid emphasis on the need for ensuring that the Secretary, Military Department, India Office, shall maintain close relations
with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff; but it is no less essential that he should be in close communication with the Commander-in-Chief in India, and fully possessed of his general views. For this purpose, and in order that he may not lose touch with current developments, we think that he should visit India during his term of office: We foresee no difficulty in arranging for such visits, provided that suitable arrange-ments are made for the performance of his duties in the India Office during his absence.Conclusion.28. (a.) The Secretary, Military Department, India Office, should be the adviser of the Secretary of State for India on such local military questions as are described in the preceding paragraphs. It is his duty to keep in close touch with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and to keep him thoroughly informed in regard to all matters that may concern him.(&amp;.) To enable him to advise the Secretary of State for India on administrative and on local strategic questions, it is essential that the Secretary, Military Depart-ment, should be an officer of Indian experience, and that he should have recently served on the General Staff at Army Headquarters in India.(c.) In order that he may be fully possessed of the views of the Government of India and Commander-in-Chief, and in order that he may not lose touch with current developments, we recommend that he should visit India during his term of office.(7.) Appointment of Military Member of India Council.29. In paragraph 4. of their Report Lord Esher&apos;s Committee stated : . &quot; We are unable to see any advantage, from the point of view of India, in retaining upon the India Council in London the services of an officer of high military rank. It is undesirable that the Secretary of State for India should be left in any doubt as to the quarter from which military advice should be offered him. The principle upon which we think it important to insist is that the sole responsible military adviser of the Secretary of State should be the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. This advice could be tendered either through his Deputy Chief established in the India Office, or directly by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff himself, who should be authorised to attend any meeting of the Council of India at which military questions of first importance are to be discussed.&quot;30. We have stated in paragraph 16 above that we share the view of the Esher Committee that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, with the authority of the Secretary of State for War, should be the supreme military adviser of the Secretary of State for India on questions of Imperial strategy.31. While we do not dissent from the view that from a purely military point of view, there would be no objection to the abolition of the appointment of Military Member of the India Council, there are other important considerations which have led us to recommend its retention.In view of the dissatisfaction at the present prevailing among Indian Army officers it is specially desirable that any measure that could be regarded as showing want of consideration for them should be avoided. To deprive them of one of the most sought after appointments in the service would be regarded as a slight. Further, the presence of a soldier on the India Council is regarded by the Indian Army as a safeguard to their interests; for under the Government of India Act the Secretary of State in Council is ultimately responsible to Parliament for all administrative matters connected with the Indian Army. Another reason for the retention of the Military Member is that the India councils intended to be more or less representative of the various aspects of Indian life; and it is inexpedient that so important a section of the community as the Army should be excluded from it.Conclusion.32. .We recommend that, in order to maintain the representative character of the Secretary of State&apos;s Council, the appointment of a military officer of high, rank as a Member of the India Council should be continued.
(8.) High Command in India.33. In paragraphs 12 and 13 of their Report Lord Esher&apos;s Committee state :-&apos;: We recommend that in future the Army Department and the Headquarters Staff should be consolidated under one head, and with a single secretariat, which is hot at present the case, and that the Commander-in-Chief should be in that capacity considered to be the administrative, as well as the executive head of the Army, subject only to the Governor-General in Council, in whom the supreme, control of the Army is vested by statute. Every trace of the duality of functions resulting from the same officer being Commander-in-Chief and Member-in-Charge of the Army Department should be swept away.&quot; We are of opinion that the financial responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief should not be divorced from his executive responsibilities, and that, while his purely military status should be in no way affected, it should be recognised that he possesses a personal and professional interest in and responsibility for the economical administration of Army funds. We are in agreement with the view that the Commander-in-Chief should be looked upon by all His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects and feudatories in India as the depository and representative of a personal authority, second only to that of the Viceroy; and we are strongly of opinion that any change in the position of the Commander-in-Chief, which would have the effect of weakening that authority, is inadvisable.&quot;34. In paragraph 14 of their confidential despatch No. 10 of February 1921 the Government of India stated that they &quot; have been gradually but inevitably led to the view that the time is not far distant when the administrative control of the Army in India must be entrusted to a Civilian Army Member of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council, leaving the Commander-in-Chief an Extraordinary Member of the Governor-GeneraLs Council, but free to devote himself to the functions of tendering military advice to the Governor-General and of command, inspection, discipline and training.&quot;The Secretary of State in Council has also expressed the opinion &quot; that a Civil Minister of Defence should eventually be substituted for the Commander-in-Chief as a Member of Council, and that pending such substitution the Commander-in-Chief, while retaining all the rights Of a Member of Council, should, at the Viceroy&apos;s discre-tion, be excused attendance at the Executive Council, and that the necessity for his appearance at the Council of State or at the Legislative Assembly should, as far as-possible, be obviated by arrangements to secure the adequate representation of miitary-tary interests when necessary in his absence.&quot;35. During the brief period that the new Constitution established under the Government of India Act of 1919 has been in operation events have moved rapidly in India. The duties now falling to the Commander-in-Chief are, under existing condi-tions, too arduous for one man successfully to perform. He is a Member of the Executive Council and also a Member of the Council of State, with the right to speak in the Legislative Assembly. Neither the Chief of the Imperial General Staff at the present time nor the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in former days was placed in so difficult a position as a Commander-in-Chief in India is placed in to-day, and owing to the growing bitterness of political controversy his position is daily becoming more difficult.36. It has been suggested that the appointment of a Civilian Minister of Defence would be derogatory to the status of the Commander-in-Chief. We do not hold that, view. We consider that a Commander-in-Chief detached from politics would be in a stronger position than he is in at present, and that the Government of India could more confidently rely upon his advice on military questions if he were freed from the political duties that are now cast upon him.37. The Government of India, whose views on the question were, at our instance, sought by the Secretary of State for India, are, however, of opinion that in the present financial conditions it is impracticable to create the new appointment of a Civil Army Member.[7984] C    -
Conclusion.38. We do not recommend that any*change should be made at present, but we consider that as soon as the financial situation permits, the question of creating a new appointment of a Civil Army Member should be reconsidered.(9.) Status of the Air Officer Commanding Royal Air Force in India.39. The Secretary of State for Air has drawn our attention to the present position of the A.O.C. Royal Air Force in India. At present, the A.O.C. Royal Air Force in India is, under the general control of the Commander-in-Chief, responsible for the efficiency of the Air Force in India and for the administration of the funds allotted to the1 force.40. It is stated that this arrangement has proved unsatisfactory, even on the basis of the present strength of the Air Force in India. It has been suggested that, while the A.O.C. should remain responsible to the Commander-in-Chief (as Army Member of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council) for the efficiency of the Air Force personnel and materiel, he should be given the status of a Secretary to the Government of India, with the right of direct access to the Viceroy on air matters. It is claimed that this right of access is an obvious corollary to the existence of the air arm as an independent service, and it is suggested that the experience of the last three years has shown that the interests of the air service have been sacrificed to military requirements in a way which is seriously prejudicial both to the organisa-tion and moral of the Air Force in India. The Government of India, whose views on the question were, at our instance, sought by the Secretary of State for India, are, however, of opinion that the status of the Air Officer Commanding should remain unchanged.Conclusion.41. While we are of opinion that existing arrangements have not proved satis-factory, we consider that a decision on this point should be deferred until a report has been received from the Senior Air Officer, who we recommend should be sent to India&apos; to study, under the general direction of the Commander-in-Chief, the use of the Air Force in Indian warfare (see Section (21) of this Report).(10.) Organisation and Administration of the Army in India.42. The scheme for the organisation of the Army in four commands was submitted by the Government of India in their despatch No. 11 of the 3rd February, 1921, in which they explained that &quot; in view of the normal peace functions of the Army in relation to the Civil Administration, and the ever-present possibility of unrest of a varying degree on our North-West Frontier, we are of opinion that the organisation of the country into four commands, with one independent district for Burma, is the best method of providing for the requisite military co-operation and control, both during times of peace and during times of war. We also agree to the proposed sub-division of these four commands into thirteen districts (exclusive of Burma), and of the further sub-division of these districts into brigade commands, though the proposed geographical limits of the districts and brigade commands may require some modification after detailed examination by local Governments. We also accept the proposals of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief regarding the general principles on which the organisation and system of staff work in commands and districts should be based.&quot;In that despatch the Government of India also stated that the proposals had been examined by Lord Esher&apos;s Committee on the Army in India, who considered that the organisation was generally suited to local conditions.Conclusion.43. (a.) As the scheme was approved in principle by the Secretary of State for India in his telegram of the 29th September, 1920, we have not thought it necessary
to study it in detail. The principles on which their proposals are based are clearly set forth in the despatch of the Government of India, and we consider that the scheme pf organisation in four commands is well adapted to the local conditions of India.(&amp;.) In the interests of economy, the Army should be organised with strict regard to the limited nature of the duties that it may be called upon to discharge. We understand that that principle has been applied to the troops allotted to internal security duties, the organisation of which both tactically and administratively has been reduced to its simplest form. It may be that a simpler organisation for the higher tactical formation of the Field Army would meet the requirements of frontier defence. We recommend that the Government of India should consider the possibility of effecting economies by that means.(c.) We do not consider that we can usefully express an opinion as to the proposed terms of enlistment, rates of pay and conditions of service. Such matters must be dealt with by the Government of India.(d:) We are of opinion that the equipment of the Army in India should be thoroughly modern, and, with due regard to Indian conditions, should be in accord-ance with the present-day patterns and standards of the British Army, so that when the Army in India has to co-operate with the British Army there may be no avoid-able dissimilarities.(11.) Purpose for which the Army in India is Maintained.44. There is no difference of opinion as to the objects for which the Army in India is maintained. We consider that the resolution of the Legislative Assembly which is, in substance, that the purposes for which the Army is maintained in. India are (p.) The defence of India against external aggression; and lb.) The maintenance of internal order,states concisely and accurately the objects for which the Army in India exists.(12.) Employment of the Army in India Oversea.45. On the 28th March, 1921, the Legislative Assembly passed a resolution as-follows :  &quot; That the Army in India should not as a rule be employed for service outside the external frontiers of India, except for purely defensive purposes or with the previous consent of the Governor-General in Council in very grave emergencies, provided that this resolution does not preclude the employment on garrison duties overseas of Indian troops at the expense of His Majesty&apos;s Government and with the consent of the Government of India.&quot;46. In paragraph 3 of their confidential despatch No. 10 of the 3rd February, 1921, the Government of India claimed that they should be consulted on all questions-of foreign policy involving employment of Indian troops outside India, and that where such employment is found to be necessary a definite request should be made in advance to the Government of India, and their views on the subject should be fully considered by the Imperial Government. They urged that the principle should be established that Indian troops belonging to the Indian Army should not be employed beyond the confines of British India without the -specific concurrence of the Government of India. They recognised, however, that in a national crisis it might be difficult to maintain full compliance with that principle, and stated that as in the past they would be prepared to accept such directions issued by the Imperial Government as might be required in the interests of the Empire on occasions of exceptional emergency.. -&apos;- [79841    ^ C 2
47. Constitutionally, the position is governed by the Government of India Act, 1915-16, as amended in 1919, which provides that Indian troops can only be demanded from India by the Secretary of State for India through the Governor-General in Council. Section 22 of the Act provides that, except for preventing or repelling actual invasion of His Majesty&apos;s Indian possessions or under otner sudden and urgent necessity, the revenues of India shall not be applied to pay for any military operations beyond the frontier of those possessions without the consent of both Houses of Parliament. Hitherto, the demands of His Majesty&apos;s Government for Indian troops for service oversea have always Been made in a constitutional manner; and the Government of India have always readily complied with such demands.Conclusion.48. We recognise that the Indian Army cannot be treated as if it were absolutely at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government for service outside India. We consider that the principle should be generally accepted that, except in the gravest emergency, the Indian Army should be employed outside the Indian Empire only after consultation with the Governor-General-in-Council.(13.) Provision of Oversea Garrisons in Time of Peace.49. In a telegram, dated the 3rd September, 1920, the Government of India stated that they had evidence to show that the great bulk of Indian educated opinion was opposed to India undertaking obligations in regard to oversea garrisons. They stated that they looked with grave concern on what they held to be the inevitable consequences, political and otherwise, of an arrangement which would commit the Government of India to supply oversea garrisons for a prolonged period from the Indian Army. The Government of India stated, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government might rely upon their doing their best to endeavour to enlist men in India on their behalf for local forces maintained in Mesopotamia and elsewhere, and added that they would be glad to receive some definite statement of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to that matter.50. On the 28th March, 1921, the Legislative Assembly adopted the following resolution : &apos;&apos; That this Assembly recommends to &quot;the Governor-General in Council that the Army in India should not, as a rule, be employed for service outside the external frontiers of India, except for purely defensive purposes or with the previous consent of the Governor-General in very grave emergencies, provided that this resolu-tion does not preclude the employment on garrison overseas of Indian troops at the expense of His Majesty&apos;s Government and with the consent of the Government of India.&quot;Conclusion.51. We share the view of the Government of India that the Indian Army should not be required permanently to provide large oversea garrisons. We recom-mend that units required for such purposes should be maintained in addition to the establishment laid down for the Indian Army, and that the whole cost, direct and indirect, of recruiting and maintaining such units should be borne by His Majesty&apos;s Government, or by the dependency or colony requiring their services.(14.) Forces required for Maintenance of Internal Order.52. The views of the non-official witnesses who gave evidence before Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee on the question of the proportion of British troops required for internal security purposes vary between recommendations for the complete elimination of British troops and for the preservation of the existing proportion. The majority of the unofficial witnesses favoured a reduction of the numbers of British troops on grounds of economy and because they alleged that their presence
(15.) Proposal to raise Armed Police in the Provinces to replace Regular Troops.56. In paragraph 22 of the Report of Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee it is stated that local Governments have of late been in the habit of relying to a large extent on the employment of troops on what are strictly speaking police duties in connection with riots and disturbances on a large scale. They therefore recommended that, with a view to an eventual reduction of the number of troops that are earmarked for internal security, local Governments should be advised to undertake the development of properly constituted armed police battalions.57. It is a generally accepted principle that military force should be employed for the maintenance of internal order only when the situation has passed beyond the control of the civil authorities; and we consider that in India as elsewhere the Army should be relieved from such duty except in grave emergencies.58. We have considered the possibility of establishing armed police or gendarmerie, British or Indian, to replace in some measure the regular troops allotted to internal security duties.Small forces of military police are now maintained by the local Governments of Bengal and Behar and Orissa for the maintenance of internal order; and in Burma and Assam military police are employed in considerable numbers for frontier protection duties.59. At our instance the Secretary of State for India consulted the Government of India as to the possibility, financial and otherwise, of extending the use of such forces.  In their telegram No. 217 of the 10th February the Government of India setexcited racial prejudice and implied want of confidence in the Indian people on the part of the Government of India. All the official witnesses, on the other hand, are opposed to any reduction of British troops allotted to internal security duties. They pointed out that, although British troops are seldom actually employed, the moral effect of their presence acts as a deterrent to the ill-disposed. These witnesses further expressed the opinion that disturbances will be either of a racial or of a.religious character; and that in either case Indian troops must be biassed, whereas British troops are impartial and aloof from religious and racial disputes.53. Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee recommended a net reduction of one battalion in the troops allotted to internal, security; but they proposed that three British cavalry regiments and five British infantry battalions allotted to those duties should be replaced by three Indian cavalry regiments and four Indian infantry battalions. The proviso was added, however, that serious deterioration in the internal or external situations might necessitate modification or postponement in putting this plan into execution.54. The Government of India accepted generally the recommendations contained in the Report, but they stated that all the local Governments had taken strong exception to the proposed substitution of Indian for British troops for internal security, and consequently they had decided that no action in regard to that recommendation should be taken until, in their opinion, the political situation justified the carrying out of the proposals. When framing their budget, however, they proposed to give a year&apos;s notice to the War Office regarding the reduction of British troops mentioned in paragraph 53 above.Conclusion.55. In the face of the evidence given by the official witnesses who are responsible for the government of India, as well as by certain unofficial witnesses, we do not feel justified in recommending any reduction either in the aggregate number of troops allotted to internal security or in the proportion of British troops assigned to that duty.
forth their objections to the proposal, and stated that they had come to the conclusion that its adoption was inadvisable.Conclusion.60. We recognise that the Government of India must be the judge as to the practicability of establishing such forces; but we suggest that this proposal requires further and detailed consideration by the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India.       &apos; -(16.) Substitution of the Territorial Force for Regular Troops.61. In paragraph 25 of the Report of Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee it is stated:: &quot; In considering the various measures which might enable us to reduce the strength of the standing Army, several witnesses have suggested a possibility of reduction on the employment of the Indian Territorial Force for internal security duties. Even those who do not press this particular aspect of the question are unanimous in urging the necessity for pushing on with the organisation of this Force at the earliest possible date. They think that, given proper encouragement, there would be no lack of recruits, and that we should be able to raise 100,000 to 150,000 men, as the existence of an Indian Territorial Force would appeal strongly to the spirit of Indian nationalism. It is a feeling which we have found reproduced strongly in the debates in our Legislative Assembly and which we believe is wide-spread throughout the country; we have no hesitation in giving it our support.&quot; We are therefore strongly of opinion that this experiment should be given all encouragement; but, before venturing an opinion as to whether the Territorial Force could or could not be relied upon to replace regular troops in internal security, we think that it would be wise to await the response of the people as evinced by their readiness to join the Force, so as to enable our military authorities to judge of the degree of efficiency that the Force is likely to reach.&quot;62. The Indian Territorial Force was established in 1920. Its total strength is now about 4,000. The Force consists entirely of Indians and is recruited mainly from the rural areas. A battalion of Parsis has, however, been raised in Bombay, where there is also a University Training Corps of two companies..The Territorial Force cannot yet be regarded as a serious accession to the military strength of India, and we do not consider that in its present stage of development it can replace regular troops for internal security duties.In Section (27) of this Report, in considering the question of the Indianisation of the Indian Army,, we point out that in view of the unsettled state of public opinion in India, and of the doubtful measure of support upon which the Government can count at the present time, special caution is necessary in all that relates to the armed forces; and for the same reasons we recommend in Section (20) that no change should be made in the proportion of British to Indian troops.We cannot, therefore, contemplate with equanimity the prospect of the establishment of a Territorial Force of 100,000 to 150,000 strong, composed of Indians and commanded by Indian officers, as proposed by Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee. There is a grave danger that such a Force would come under the control of the extremists, and would be used as an instrument for gaining political ends.Conclusion.&quot; 63. We do not desire to discourage the legitimate aspirations of Indians -to take an active part in the defence of their country. We therefore recommend -that the experiment of creating a Territorial Force should be continued in selected localities, but that the number of units should be limited to twenty battalions with ancillary services, and that the maximum strength of the Force should not exceed 20,000 of all ranks. The movement should be kept under close supervision, and if there are any indications of an attempt to use the Force for political purposes or if a reasonable standard of military efficiency is not maintained the units affected should at once be disbanded.&quot;
siKuadxiwater^aee^i^^disbadided.(17.) Substitution of the Auxiliary Force for Regular Troops.64. The Auxiliary Force which was established in 1920 is composed entirely of Europeans and Anglo-Indians voluntarily recruited. It has taken the place of the Indian Defence Force raised on a compulsory basis during the war. It has a total strength of about 30,000, and is concentrated mainly in the centres of European business, such as Calcutta, Bombay and the planting districts.65. In considering the possibility of employing the Auxiliary Force to replace a part of the British garrison allotted to internal security duties, Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee pointed out that the Force is by law available for local service only. Whether called up at the request of a civil magistrate to disperse an unlawful assembly or embodied by order of Government in time of emergency arising out of civil disorder, it can only be employed within a restricted, area. The Auxiliary Force is thus really in the nature of a town guard composed mainly of local commercial and professional men. As long as the ordinary business life of the locality is maintained the units forming the Force could not be either moved from their own locality or embodied for military duty at their own headquarters for an indefinite period.66. Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee considered that after the individual members of the Auxiliary Force had arranged, for the protection of their homes and commercial concerns, a part of the force might become available for service with mobile columns, or to discharge military duties in Presidency towns; the Committee did not, however, find themselves justified in recommending that any portion of the force should replace regular British troops allotted to internal security duties at present.Conclusion.67. We share the view of Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee that from the nature of its terms of service the Auxiliary Force cannot replace regular troops for internal security duties, but we think that in time of internal disorder it will have consider-able military value.(18.) Policy in regard to Waziristan.68. Before 1917 Waziristan was held by irregular troops on two widely separated lines, Bannu-Datta Khel (Tochi Valley) and Tank-Wana. That plan of occupation proved ineffective, because it left uncontrolled the large inaccessible tract of country inhabited by the Mahsuds lying between those lines. In 1917 an attempt was made to maintain peace on the borders of Southern Waziristan by adopting an attitude of passive defence. Raids into British territory from across the border, however, became so frequent that&apos; a punitive expedition into Central Waziristan had to be undertaken that year. The expedition was successful, and the troops were withdrawn when they had achieved their object.69. In 1919-20, as a result of the Afghan War, there was a general rising of the tribes in Waziristan, and the Mahsuds were warned by the Government of India that if they did not submit their country would be permanently occupied. They did not submit, and their country was accordingly occupied. In March 1920 it was agreed that occupation of the Central Mahsud country was the best means of pacifying the country and protecting the frontier.   The military measures and road
construction necessary for such occupation were accordingly authorised, the question of eventual policy being reserved for later consideration. A few months ago an announcement was made to the tribes that the Government of India intended to remain in Waziristan as long as they pleased, and to administer the country on tribal lines in accordance with tribal usage and custom.70. In order to give effect to that policy, the Government of India, with the approval of the Secretary of State for India, decided to carry out an extensive road construction programme, &quot;and to occupy the country with a force of five brigades (to be reduced later to four brigades) together with the necessary quota of &quot; force &quot; troops, i.e., units not included in the brigade organisation. The programme included the construction of a motor road from railhead at Khirgi up the Takki Zam to Ladha, and a road from Ladha via Razmak to Idak and thence to Thai, affording lateral communication through the centre of the Mahsud country, and enabling reinforce-ments to be moved rapidly from north to south, without the long detour and expensive journey by rail which is at present necessary.71. Owing to the serious financial position of the country, the Government of India have considered it necessary to propose a change in the policy recently approved.  Four courses are open : (a.) Complete evacuation of &quot;Waziristan combined with economic and political measures.(b.) Partial evacuation of Waziristan coupled with the extended employment of tribal scouts.   (Scheme now recommended by the Government of India.)(c.) Occupation of Waziristan with a brigade of regular troops at Razmak and two battalions on the line of communications between Razmak and Idak. (Scheme (d) modified by General Staff.)(d) Continued occupation and control of Waziristan as at present approved, which includes the quartering of a brigade of regular troops in Central Waziristan.   (Scheme of Government of India, 1920.)72. The cost of (a) is estimated at 250 lakhs in 1922-23, 83-85 lakhs in 1923-24 and 48 lakhs in 1924-25 and succeeding years, so that from an economic point of view evacuation has primd facie much to commend it. Evacuation would, however, have serious consequences. It is probable that the withdrawal would entail difficult military operations and possibly heavy casualties. Experience shows that evacua-tion would expose British subjects on our borders to constant raids; and complete reconquest of the country would almost certainly be necessary in a few years&apos; time at a great cost. We understand that the policy of occupation has already had a salutary effect upon the Mahsuds. They have been told that we should occupy their territory. If we now withdraw the regular troops from the Central Mahsud country they will never believe again that we shall be able to enforce that threat. The policy of withdrawal would also have serious effect upon our relations with the Afridis and other tribes and also with the Amir of Afghanistan. Sir H. Dobbs has expressed the opinion that &quot; the first condition for the observance of the treaty by the Amir is a firm adherence to our present policy of dominating Waziristan and the Khyber.&quot; He believes that if we evacuate Waziristan Afghan agitators would lose no oppor-tunity of impressing upon the tribes that Afghanistan had caused the evacuation, and the Amir might be tempted to turn his attention to the annexation of Waziristan to his country. We concur in these views. The policy of evacuation is not recom-mended by the Government of India, and, for the reasons given above, it does not commend itself to us.73. Partial evacuation (scheme (b)) is now recommended by the Government of India as a measure of economy.  The scheme is briefly as follows : ;(1.) To retain the existing garrison of the Tochi Valley.(2.) To withdraw all the regular troops now in Central and Southern Waziristan to within our administrative border, five battalions, one cavalry regiment and one pack battery being located between Manzai and Dera Ismail Khan.(3.) To hold Razmak with 500 tribal scouts. (4) To grant increased tribal allowances.
74. The cost of this scheme is estimated at 273-4 lakhs in 1922-23, 95 lakhs in 1923-24 and 40 lakhs in 1924-25 and succeeding years. In this scheme the only road construction to be undertaken includes a mechanical transport road from Idak to-Razmak, about 40 miles, and a cis-frontier road from Draband to Ghazni Khel, about 50 miles. It is claimed by the Government of India that the scheme offers reasonable prospects of success. They state that it will give us a foothold in the country, and that Razmak will form an advanced base where a striking force can be assembled, and from which the more thickly populated areas of the Mahsud country can be dominated.75. The scheme has, however, serious drawbacks. We do not believe that it would give effective control over the Mahsud country. It would involve the abandon-ment of the Khirgi-Ladha road, on the construction of which 86 lakhs have already been spent. A further drawback to the scheme is that it would necessitate the quartering of regular troops in the unhealthy lowlands of the Indus Valley in makeshift and ruinous barracks. The estimates furnished for 1922-23 do not allow for the barrack accommodation required, whereas, under existing arrangements, the troops are living in comparative comfort in the healthy highlands of Central Waziristan. Finally, if the scheme fails we shall be again compelled to undertake-an expedition into Waziristan at a great cost both in lives and money. We are unable, therefore, to recommend the acceptance of the Government of Indians-proposal (b).76. The modified scheme (c), now proposed by the Indian General Staff, involves the continued occupation of the Tochi Valley, the location of regular troops at. Razmak, with two battalions on the lines of communication to Idak. The construc-tion of a road from Idak to Razmak, 40 miles, and a road from Draband to Ghazni Khel, 50 miles, would be necessary, but the Jandola would be held by scouts, regular troops being posted between Manzai and Dera Ismail Khan. The remainder of the road programme originally proposed would be abandoned. The cost of this scheme is estimated at 3-96 crores in 1922-23, 1-56 crores in 1923-24, 1-1 crores in 1924-25 and -83 crore thereafter. We consider that under this scheme the military occupa-tion of Central Waziristan would be effective. Its disadvantages as compared with scheme (d) are that more troops would be quartered in the unhealthy Indus Valley stations, and that important parts of the road construction programme would be abandoned. We consider that the construction of lateral communications in Waziristan, enabling troops to be rapidly moved from north to south, is one of the measures in which lies the hope of ultimate pacification and reduction in expenditure.77. Scheme (d), which includes the completion of the road from Khirgi to Thai,, is estimated to cost 4-68 crores in 1922-23, 3-98 crores in 1923-24 and 3-32 crores in 1924-25. These figures do not, however, present a true comparison with the cost of the other schemes; for if the programme of road construction, which is an essential feature of the scheme, is completed, we believe that scheme (d) will ultimately result in substantial economy and a reduction of the forces now necessary to maintain order on that part of the frontier.78. There are other considerations which lead us to the same conclusion. The present situation in the Middle East, the uncertain temper of Afghanistan and the general unrest prevailing among Mahommedans in India render it an inopportune moment to initiate any scheme for partial evacuation of Waziristan, which might be interpreted by the tribesmen as a first step towards withdrawal from their country. For these reasons we consider that the original scheme (d) of the Government of India for the control of the country should be adhered to and that the full road construction programme should be completed. We are also led to hope that in the future still further economy may be effected by the increased use of the Air Force (see Section (21) of this Report).79. We desire to explain that, in recommending the adoption of scheme (d), we aq not express a decided preference for Ladha over Razmak as a station for regular troops.   In the evidence laid before us opinion was divided as to whether, from a
ISpolitical and strategic point of view, the occupation of Razmak would be as effective as the occupation of Ladha for the control of the Mahsud country. We are inclined to think that a force at Razmak would be in a position effectively to control that country; but the decision between the two places must rest with the Government of India, who will probably be influenced by considerations of amenity and adminis-trative convenience, of which we have no knowledge.Conclusions.80. (a.) We are of opinion that at the present time it would not be safe to relax our control over Waziristan.(&amp;.) As at present advised, we are unable to recommend for acceptance the latest proposals of the Government of India. We should like to see scheme (d) adhered to and the programme of road construction recommended by the General Staff completed; but as communications are still passing between the Government of India and the Secretary of State on the subject, and other possibilities have, we understand, been suggested, we make no definite recommendations.(19.) Defence against External Aggression.81. In paragraph 14 of their Report, Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee expressed the opinion that -&apos;&apos; Ideally, of course1, our field Army should be in a position to occupy Kabul, the heart of Afghanistan, at the earliest possible moment, for this alone can insure our bringing Afghanistan to her knees. And quite apart from military and financial considerations, It is politically of paramount importance that an Afghan war should be brought to a speedy conclusion while there is still a united Afghanistan to treat with. The General Staff assure us that our field Army, as it is at present constituted, merely suffices for the occupation of either Kandahar or Jalalabad, and that for the ultimate occupation of Kabul we must rely on the Army we should have to begin to build up on the outbreak of war. Clearly, therefore, we are debarred from seeking a reduction of our military require-ments in any reduction of our field Army.&quot;82. In a telegram dated the 21st August, 1919, the Government of India stated that they did not consider that it would be legitimate on either financial or general grounds to maintain permanently as part of the peace organisation of the Indian Army the complete establishments and equipments necessary to ensure an advance on Kandahar and Kabul being undertaken immediately war is declared. They added that such a standard would not be necessary if reinforcements of aircraft, transport and equipment could be guaranteed from England within six weeks or two months. In a telegram dated the 27th September, 1921, the Government of India stated that to enable a simultaneous advance on Kabul and Kandahar to be made reinforcements of two cavalry brigades and three divisions would probably be required.83. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has satisfied us that the British Army is not at the present time in a position to furnish the reinforcements necessary \ to enable a simultaneous advance on Kandahar and Kabul to be undertaken within a brief period of the outbreak of war. The plan for such an advance must therefore for the present be abandoned.84. It has been urged that, in the event of a war with Afghanistan, an advance on Jalalabad is necessary to maintain our prestige, in accordance with the general principle that, in dealing with Asiatic races, it is always right to assume the offensive. That principle must, however, be applied with discretion. Our campaigns in the mountain borderland have not been so uniformly successful in the past as to justify the belief that our prestige would certainly Be enhanced by an advance to Jalalabad. Experience shows that, in maintaining lines of communication through the mountain valleys and gorges on the frontier, attacks on convoys and minor reverses are inevitable.   News of such incidents would be spread and their success
exaggerated throughout India. While the report of a serious reverse to British arms beyond the frontier might well have the effect of. precipitating a crisis in India. Under existing conditions, it is highly inexpedient that the Army in India should be committed to military operations on a large scale in the mountain region on our borders if such operations can be avoided. To entangle a large part of our military forces in the mountain regions beyond our frontier would greatly reduce our power of dealing effectively with an internal rising. We do not, therefore, consider that the military advantages to be gained by an advance to Jalalabad, in the event either of a war with Afghanistan alone or in conjunction with a tribal rising on a large scale, are, under existing conditions, sufficient to justify the undertaking of so hazardous a military operation.85. On the other hand, it is highly undesirable that the British forces should adopt a purely passive role. As, under existing conditions, a military invasion of Afghanistan cannot be contemplated, some other means of bringing pressure to bear upon the Amir or frontier tribes within their own borders must be devised. It appears that the use of the Air Force offers a possible solution. But the question of the use of the Air Force in Indian warfare requires much closer consider-ation than it has yet received. We make recommendations on this subject in Section (21) of.this Report.Conclusions.86.-(a.) In present circumstances, financial and military, it is not possible to \   base the defence of the frontier on any plan of campaign involving an advance in force to or towards Kabul.(b.) Our policy should be, as far as possible, to avoid committing the Army to military operations on a large scale in the mountainous border region, and to keep our Field Army concentrated and held in readiness either to strike heavily at the enemy&apos;s formed bodies as occasion offers or to turn and crush internal risings in India,(20.) Proportion of British to Indian Troops.87. When the Army in India was reorganised after the Mutiny, the ratio of British to Indian troops was fixed at 1 to 2 for the Bengal Army and 1 to 3 for the Madras and Bombay Armies: only cavalry and infantry units were included in these figures.88. In 1893, owing to the development of better means of communication in India, a proportion of 1 to 2-5 was fixed for the whole of India. Between 1903 and 1908 correspondence passed between the Government of India and the Secretary of State in regard to the ratio and the method of. its calculation. As a result of that correspondence a new basis for the assessment of the ratio was laid down and various changes were made by the inclusion in the calculation of the Indian totals of certain Imperial service troops and military police corps. The general proportion of 1 British to 2-5 Indians was, however, maintained, with the proviso that the question should be reviewed every five years. That was the ratm when the war broke out in 1914, the last assessment having been made in the previous year.89. In paragraph 38 of their Report, Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee stated  &quot;that the basis upon which the existing assessment of the ratio of British to Indian troops in the Army in India is founded is no longer applicable, nor is it acceptable to the people of this country. It has been repeatedly impressed, upon us by our Indian witnesses that the people whom they represent have a right to demand that the Government should trust them. They point out that such measure of self-government as they have already been granted is, in fact, an acknowledgement that they are worthy of trust, and that the extension of such confidence to matters dealing with defence is the natural corollary thereof. If this point is conceded, it follows that not only does the existing ratio of
British to Indian troops stand in need of revision, but that the assessment itself on which the ratio depends needs revision, if not complete abolition. In our opinion, the old method of assessment is radically unsound, and the only criterion of the necessity for retaining any given proportion of British to Indian troops is that of relative military efficiency. Improvements in armament, the introduction of new services such as the Royal Air Force, the Signal Service, and the Tank Corps, and the larger numbers of combatants now employed in the transport and other ancillary services, render any calculation, which is based solely upon a numerical computation, worthless when it comes to gauging the actual efficiency of the various parts of the military machine. We have endeavoured to analyse the proportion of British to Indian soldiers in the three different categories to which the troops in this country are detailed, and have found it impossible to reduce the factors involved to one common denominator, since the conditions governing the employment of the troops in each of the three categories differ so much among themselves. The proposition which we have to offer in this respect is that the problem should come up for periodical review every two years, that the duties of the troops in each of the three categories should be considered separately, and that increases or decreases in the British element should be recommended in terms of units according to the conclusions arrived at from time to time.&quot;90. At the present time, after allowance has been made for the inclusion of certain new formations such as the Royal Air Force and the Mechanical Transport Corps, the ratio for the whole army in India is 1 British to 2-41 Indians. The ratio varies in the different portions of the Army, and is dependent upon the nature of the duties assigned to them. In the covering force, for example, the proportion is 1 British to 6 Indians, in the Field Army 1 British to 2-5 Indians, and in the internal security troops 1-24 British to 1 Indian.91. Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee do not consider the existing ratio of British to Indian troops in the covering force too high. They point out that the low proportion is largely due to the fact that the conditions of life on the frontier are unsuitable for British troops; thev remark, however, that there are now, as compared with the pre-war period, two more battalions of British infantry allotted to the frontier, and they suggest that when the frontier conditions become more stable the question of retaining these battalions should be investigated.92. In the Field Army, the existing proportion is determined by the policy initiated by Lord Kitchener of providing one British regiment or battalion in each cavalry and infantry brigade. In France, it was proved that the British element in this combination was too weak, and it had to be strengthened; but in Palestine and Mesopotamia the proportion was found satisfactory for dealing with the Turkish forces. On the assumption that the primary duty of the Indian Army is the defence of the Indian frontier against an enemy whose organisation would not be superior to that of the Turks during the late war, Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee considered that the principle should be laid down that each brigade should contain one British unit; this, with the inclusion of the other combatant units, would mean in a division a proportion of 1 British to 2-5 Indians, so that this formation, which is generally regarded as the most suitable organisation for the larger tactical units, would not have an undue proportion of British soldiers.93. As regards the ratio in internal security troops, Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee, in view of the imperative necessity for economy in the Military Budget, recommended the replacement of eight British units by seven Indian ones, subject to the proviso that serious deterioration in the internal or external situation might necessitate modification or postponement in putting this plan into execution. They recommended, finally, that the question of the ratio generally should be reviewed every two years, and that the troops in each of the three portions of the army should be considered separately, and increases or decreases in the British element should be recommended in terms of units according to the conclusions arrived at on the review.94. The Government of India, while generally accepting the Report of Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee, held the view that no reduction in the numbers of British
(21.) Co-operation of Air Force.96. In paragraph 85 of this Report, in discussing the question of the defence of India against external aggression, we have suggested that extended use of the Air Force offers a possible solution of the difficulty of taking offensive action against Afghanistan. The Chief of the Air Staff has suggested that the Air Force in India should be strengthened in such a manner as to enable continuous bombing operations to be undertaken against the vital points of Afghanistan for a period of six months. The experience available of the effect of air operations against uncivilised races without the co-operation of land forces is insufficient to enable a confident opinion to be formed as to the effect of such intensive bombing operations. The offensive power of the Air Force is, however, developing rapidly; and under existing conditions it appeared to us that no other means of undertaking offensive operations against Afghanistan are available. &apos;97. We accordingly appointed a Technical Sub-Committee composed of Military and Air Force officers with Field-Marshal Sir H. Wilson as chairman to advise as to what increase of the Air Forces now in India would be necessary to enable effective bombing of vital points in Afghanistan to be maintained for six months. The Sub-Committee recommended that the present establishment (six squadrons) of the Royal Air Force in India should be increased by the addition of two bombing squadrons.98. The Report of the Sub-Committee disclosed sharp divisions of opinion between the General and Air Staffs as to the efficacy of the Air Force as an offensive arm in Indian frontier warfare. Our deliberations have also led us to the conclusion that it is of the first importance that the views of the Air Ministry on the use of the air arm in Indian warfare, based on the experience which has recently been acquired in theatres such as Somaliland and Iraq, should be fully explained to the Government of India. We accordingly recommend that an Air Officer of high rank should be deputed to India without delay for that purpose, and to institute under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief a scientific study of the problem, especially in regard to the defence of the frontier.99. If, as we think possible, the result of this study is to show that in present conditions the most effective and most economical method of defence lies in an increase of the offensive power of the Air Force, we should hope that that conclusion would be accompanied by a clear possibility of a compensatory reduction of military expendi-ture; and we should advise that the present establishment of the Air Force in India should be increased to enable effective bombing of vital points in Afghanistan to be maintained continuously for six months.100. Recent telegrams that have been received from the Government of India reveal that there is in the squadrons in India a serious deficiency of essential spares, and that the reserves of machines and engines, the establishment of which should be maintained intact, are heavily depleted. In particular, we are gravely concerned at the Indian Governments statement in their telegram No. 274 of the 22nd February, 1922, that the aviation stores at present held are only sufficient to enable squadrons to carry out operations for two weeks in the event of war. We are informed that this is now in course of being remedied. We urge that the remaining deficiencies should at once be made good.Conclusion.101. We recommend that the use of the Air Force in Indian warfare be  further  studied  under  the. direction  of  the  Commander-in-Chief  by antroops allotted to internal security could be made until the Government of India considered that the internal situation improved.Conclusion.95. We recommend that no change should at present be made in the proportion of British to Indian troops.
(22.) Proposed Re-establishment of Punjab Frontier Force.102. In paragraph 17 of their Report, Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee state :  -&quot; Frontier warfare is a specialised form of warfare, and given regiments recruited from races adapted to hill fighting (like cis-frontier Pathans, Gurkhas, Sikhs, Punjabi Mussulmans and Dogras), continuously trained on the frontier and thus familiar with the terrain and the ways of the Pathan, the taking over of the advanced posts vacated by the Khassadars in a time of crisis would be a much less serious matter than it would otherwise be. The truth of the frontier maxim that it is quality, not quantity, that counts is brought out very clearly in Sir Claud Jacob&apos;s evidence. In Waziristan, he said, &apos; we had to depend on quantity rather than quality. In the old days with picked troops and first-class officers we should never have required the number of brigades we actually did use.&apos; If this is true of actual warfare on the frontier, it is even more true of the workaday needs of the frontier. For there is no better judge of the calibre of the troops pitted against him than the frontier tribesman; nobody more alert to take immediate advantage of any defect; nobody more on his guard when he meets his better. We are convinced that even in times of peace the security of our frontier districts would be materially strengthened and the chances of the development of serious frontier trouble materially lessened, if we maintained a number of picked regiments fully equipped with the most up-to-date appliances, and ready to move out at a momenfs notice trained and permanently stationed on the frontier, brigaded with other regiments of the Indian Army who would be sent to the frontier in the ordinary course for temporary service. In advocating a reversion to specialised frontier troops, we are not unmindful of the reasons which led to the break-up of the old Punjab Frontier Force in the interests of the efficiency of the Army as a whole, or of the dislocation of the existing Army organisation that would be involved. But both systems have now been tried on the frontier, and that the older system is the best, and much the best, for the frontier there is no room for doubt. The stronger and firmer our hold on the frontier tribesmen, the less chance there is of Afghanistan being tempted to try conclusions with us, and of our field Army accordingly being called into action. The pressing needs of the frontier therefore should in our opinion prevail. Nor is it on these grounds alone that we advocate a reversion to the Punjab Frontier Force system; we advocate it also as holding out some promise of an ultimate and substantial reduction in our covering troops. In present conditions no immediate reduction appears to us possible.&quot;Conclusion.103. The question of the re-establishment of the Punjab Frontier Force is an administrative question which requires intimate knowledge of the Indian Army and familiarity with local conditions to enable an opinion to be formed in regard to it. We do not, therefore, offer any advice on the subject. The Government of India will, of course, consider the views expressed by Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee.(23.) Possibility of Reduction of Troops in consequence of Improvements in military equipment, &amp;c.104. In paragraph 23 of their Report, Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee state that it is too early to make a pronouncement as regards the possibility of effecting a reduction in the Army in view of modern improvements in equipment and mobility.   They stated that while they hoped that ultimatelyAir Officer of high rank selected by the Secretary of State for Air on the advice of the Chief of the Air Staff; for we believe that this arm contains the possibility of great developments, and should eventually render possible considerable economies.
the efficiency of the Army in India would be increased by the introduction of the latest engines of war, there are three important considerations which must be borne in mind :  &quot;(a.) The Indian Army is undergoing a complete reorganisation both in the cavalry and in the infantry. .....&quot; (b.) The only real improvement in equipment effected up to date consists in theissue of 6-in. howitzers and Lewis and Hotchkiss guns.....We havemodern armoured cars sufficient for only three out of our eight armoured car companies, and there is no prospect of our getting satisfactory tanks in India until 1923. As regards mechanical transport, we are still some 1,800 vehicles short of our requirements for war.&quot; (c.) Our enemies, whoever they be, will not necessarily wait to attack us until we have put our house in order.&quot;They pointed out that, in spite of that unsatisfactory state of affairs, combatant troops have been reduced appreciably below the figures at.which they stood in 1914. In effect, they say, a reduction of the troops has been made in anticipation of the receipt of modern equipment, the actual provision of which has been precluded by the shortage of funds. Until, therefore, they were able to equip the reorganised Army properly, they considered it premature to consider any further reduction in its strength.105. In paragraph 24 of their Report, they further stated :  &quot; In connection with internal security a further point which is worthy of consideration is that improvements in mobility and in armament, whilst undoubtedly increasing the military efficiency of an army for the performance of its legitimate functions, do not necessarily to the same degree improve its efficiency for the maintenance of internal law and order. The Lewis gun may be considered to be equivalent to ten rifles, and the Vickers gun may similarly represent the fire power of twenty riflemen; the armoured car and the aeroplane too are admittedly very powerful instruments of destruction. But, at the same time, the primary duty of troops told off for the maintenance of peace and order is to prevent bloodshed mainly by a show of numbers, which gives all the moral value of an exhibition of physical force. In other words, it is the man and not the machine which is the more valuable for maintaining internal order and in quelling disturbances.&quot;Conclusion.106. We share the view of Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee that there is at present no possibility of reducing the troops in consequence of improvements in arms and military equipment.107. In July 1914 the establishment of the cavalry and infantry of the Army in India consisted of Cavalry regiments : 9 British, 39 Indian. Infantry battalions : 51 British, 132 Indian.These units were allotted as follows :  Internal security Cavalry regiments : 1 British, 11 Indian. Infantry battalions : 24 British, 35 Indian.(24.) Strength of Army in India.Field Army  ,Cavalry regiments : Infantry battalions8 British, 28 Indian. 27 British, 97 Indian.j
The Field Army was organised in 3 frontier brigades, 8 cavalry brigades and 7-J divisions.108. In their despatch No. 12, dated the 3rd February, 1921, after an exhaustive review of the situation, the Government of India recommended that the post-war Army should consist of-Cavalry regiments : 8 British, 21 Indian. Infantry battalions : 45 British, 109 Indian.These are at present allotted as follows : Internal security- Cavalry : 3 British, 7 Indian. Infantry: 28 British,22 Indian.Field Army (including. Covering Force)-Cavalry : 5 British, 14 Indian. Infantry : 17 British, 87 Indian.The Field Army is organised in 5 cavalry brigades and 4 divisions, together with a covering force of 12 brigades.109. The establishment of all arms for 1921 is 227,901, and in 1914 it was 233,507. There is thus a net reduction in the establishment of 1921 of 5,606 of all ranks. But the reduction in the establishment of fighting units in 1921 is 14,466, while there is an increase of 5,786 in the staffs and ancillary services; and the Royal Air Force in India, which did not exist in 1914, has an establishment of 3,101 of all ranks in 1921. -110. In order to enable the Government of India to prepare their budget for 1922-23, we arrived at the following (id interim conclusion on the 23rd December, 1921, as to immediate further reductions in the establishment of the Indian Army &quot; No further reduction in the armed forces of the Crown in India, whether British or Indian, is immediately possible. We accept for the time being the recommendation of the Government of India as to the size of the Army in India as laid down in Enclosure No. 2 to Army despatch No. 12 of the (13rd) February, 1921, and amended as regards Artillery by despatch No. 70 of August 192R and in particular as to Indian Infantry and Pioneers, namely, 100 Indian Battalions and 20 Training Battalions Infantry and 9 Battalions and 3 Training Battalions Pioneers.&quot;Any troops required to be maintained for service outside India in time of peace must be additional to the numbers quoted above.111. In the course of our examination of this question, we have been struck by the extent to which the reduction of British combatant troops has been offset by the increase in the establishment of the ancillary services. We cannot examine in detail the establishment of those services or express an opinion as to whether any reduction of their number is practicable; but we recommend that the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India should carefully review these establishments, and that they should pursue every line of enquiry with the object of making further economies in military expenditure.Conclusion.112. We are of opinion that no further reduction of the armed forces of the Crown, whether British or Indian, is immediately possible. We accept the recommendation of the Government of India, contained in their despatches No. 12 of February 1921 and No. 70 of August 1921, as to the establishment of the Army in India.
(25.) Reinforcements from England.113. In their despatch No. 12 of the 3rd February, 1921, the Government of India state&apos; that the peace establishments have been fixed in the case of British troops so as to permit of war wastage being made good from within India for a period of from two to three months, and in the case of Indian troops so as to allow of the installation of the requisite machinery for recruiting and for the training of new recruits arid for the recall and training of reservists.114. The question of reinforcements to be provided from England during the first year of a war with Russia was discussed exhaustively by the Committee of Imperial Defence between the years 1904-7. A Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which Lord Morley was Chairman, considered the question in. 1907. Lord Morley&apos;s Committee recommended that the military organisation of Great. Britain should be such as to enable 100,000 men to be despatched to India during the first year of war. This recommendation was accepted in principle by the Committee of Imperial Defence.115. Since that decision was taken the situation has undergone great changes.. On the one hand, the menace of aggression by a formidable Imperial Russian Army has been removed. On the other hand, our relations with Afghanistan are now more unsatisfactory. The sentiment of Islam is hostile to the British Empire : Bolshevik propaganda is being actively carried on in Central Asia.116. In a telegram No. 22, dated the 7th January, 1922, the Government of India sent an estimate of the reinforcements which would be required from England in certain eventualities.   They visualised the possible&apos; contingencies against which provision should be made, as follows :   (1.) War with Afghanistan.(2.) Serious and widespread risings, of the frontier tribes.(3.) Sedition involving mutiny in portions of the Indian Army.(4.) Simultaneous and co-ordinated outbreaks of rebellion in India.The Government of India considered that if all the above emergencies occurred at the same time, reinforcements of at least 6 Infantry divisions and 4 Cavalry brigades would be required. They further expressed the view that though all these contingencies were not likely to take place simultaneously, a combination of any or all, with the exception of mutiny, might occur in the not distant future.As regards the question of mutiny, the Government of India considered that though the organisation of the extremist leaders had greatly improved during the past year, all attempts to interfere with the loyalty of the Indian army had, up to the present, failed. But in view of the virulence of the seditionist campaign, they considered it impossible to say if the Indian Army would remain unaffected in the future.117. As the result of the recently approved reductions on the establishment of the British Army, the strength of the forces maintained in Great Britain available for service oversea has been greatly reduced. The expeditionary force available for immediate despatch is one division and one cavalry division. A second division will be available after about two months, and a third and a fourth division after four months. It is therefore clear that the demands that the Government of India may make in certain contingencies cannot be satisfied-.118. In Section (19) of this Report we have discussed the question of the defence of India against external aggression.If the policy of concentration which we there recommend is approved, we consider that the Government of India&apos;s demands for reinforcements from England should be susceptible of amendment both as regards numbers and composition.119. Having regard to the improvement of communications by railways, motor cars, aeroplanes and telegraph and wireless, the power of modern weapons, and to the fact that practically all the artillery in India is manned by British troops, a mutiny of. the Indian Army in combination with an internal rebellion seems unlikely to result in military operations on such a scale as would call for the employment of a force composed of British divisions of all arms. Centres of [7984] &quot; E
rebellion would no doubt be formed and a rebel Government might be set up, but in the main it seems probable that the situation would be met by guarding the main railway lines and arsenals, and holding important centres from which mobile flying columns could operate to deal with bodies of mutineers and subjugate the surrounding country. -     -Conclusion.120. We recommend that the requirements of India for reinforcements from England should be reviewed. We suggest that they might perhaps more appropriately be calculated in numbers of regiments and battalions rather than in numbers of divisions. In view of the unmartial character of many of the races of India, battalions composed of ex-service officers and men specially raised for the purpose might be equal to all the demands that would be made upon our troops in suppressing a rebellion.(26.) Disbandment of Inefficient Battalions.121. In the course of our deliberations information was laid before us showing that certain battalions of the Indian Army are recruited from non-military classes, and are useless for fighting purposes. It was suggested that these battalions were maintained for political reasons, and that they threw a charge on the Army Estimates far in excess of their military value.122. We recognise that the question of the disbandment of historic regiments is one which requires careful consideration, especially as the history of India shows that the military qualities of the different races have varied at different periods, and that the efficiency of good regiments may be adversely affected by temporary causes which can be removed. We consider, however, in the present financial situation that political considerations should not be allowed to outweigh considerations of economy- and military efficiency.123. We requested the Secretary of State for India to invite the Government of India to consider again whether certain battalions recruited from non-military races might not with advantage be replaced by a smaller number of battalions raised from the fighting classes, and also whether certain other battalions of inferior value should be retained or reconstituted. The Government of India replied that they had recently considered the question of the disbandment of the battalions of one infantry group composed of non-military races and had decided against that course. They further stated that they considered it inadvisable to reopen the question at the present time.Conclusion.124. Having regard to the views expressed by the Government of India, we are unwilling to make a definite recommendation for the immediate disbandment of these battalions; but in view of the urgent need for economy in military expenditure, we recommend that the question should be reviewed again as soon as the political -situation in India improves.(27.) Indianisation of the Indian Army.   ,125. On the 28th March, 1921, the Indian Legislative Assembly passed the following resolutions : &quot; (a.) That the King Emperor&apos;s Indian subjects should be freely admitted to all arms of His Majesty&apos;s Military, Naval and Air Forces in India, and the Ancillary Services and the Auxiliary Forces. That every encouragement-should be given to Indians, including the educated middle-classes, subject to the prescribed standard of fitness, to enter the commissioned ranks of the Army.....
&quot; (6.) That not less than 25 per cent, of the King&apos;s commissions granted every year should be given to his Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.&quot;These resolutions were accepted by the Government of India.126. In paragraph 40 of their Report, Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee recommended that the Indianisation of the Indian Army should proceed by the following method : &quot; (a.) A gradual and prudent reduction of British units in the Army in India.&quot; (b.) The gradual Indianisation of the commissioned and other appoint-ments now held in the Indian Army by British personnel, and the rendering of India more and more self-supporting as regards all arms and services.&quot;127. In Section (24) of this Report we have dealt with (a). As regards (ft), Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee recommended that 25 per cent, of the vacancies for Indian Army cadetships at Sandhurst should immediately be thrown open to Indian youths, and that that percentage should be increased by 2l per cent, annually, so that m ten years&apos; time the proportion of British and Indians entering the commissioned ranks of the Indian Army would be equal. That Committee further recommended that commissions in the Ancillary Services with separate Indian cadres, such as the Supply and Transport Corps, and the Indian Ordnance Department, should be thrown open to Indians, and also that Indians should be admitted to commissioned rank in the Indian Artillery and Indian Sappers and Miners128. The Government of India made no specific recommendation in regard to this portion of the Report of Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee.129. In their despatch No. 74 of September 1921, the Government of India have asked that: -(1.) A limited number of suitable Indian lads may be sent home for training in the Royal Air Force with a view to their obtaining commissions as officers in the Royal Air Force for service in India;(2.) A limited number of suitable Indian candidates should be admitted each year into Woolwich with a view to their obtaining commissions in such units as the Indian Pack Artillery, the Sappers and Miners and Military Works Services;(3.) The number of cadetships at Sandhurst annually for Indians should be increased from ten to twelve or thirteen, this latter number being 25 per cent, of the number of commissions granted at present annually to the Indian Army.130. We have also had before us a scheme for Indianisation prepared in the Military Department of the India Office; the essential feature of which was that a Dominion Force should gradually be formed in India. It was proposed that that Force should be initiated by the formation of one complete military unit, such as abrigadeof all arms, with ancillary services outside the establishment of the Indian Army. It was proposed that further units should be raised as soon as the success of the experiment was assured, and that the strength of the Imperial Army should be reduced pari passu with the increase of the Dominion Army.The scheme provided for the officering of the whole Dominion Force by Indians holding Dominion commissions, but a few British officers were to be allotted to units of the Dominion Force on formation for the purposes of organisation and training.131. The Secretary of State for India referred that scheme, which seemed to us to have much to commend it, to the Government of India for their observations. The Government of India rejected the scheme on the grounds that it would establish a formation surplus to the minimum military requirements of India which the country could not afford, and that it would be unfit for service in the field. They further expressed the opinion that Indian sentiment would not accept such a scheme as an earnest of our intention to Indianise the Army.
132. The Government of India accordingly submitted another scheme, dated the 11th January, 1922, prepared by a committee of military officers in India, which provided for the complete Indianisation of the Indian Army (excluding Gurkhas) in three stages of fourteen years each commencing from 1925, with the proviso that the second and third periods might be curtailed if the first period proved successful. The main feature of the scheme was the complete Indianisation of one-third of the units of the Indian Army in each period by posting Indian officers at the rate of two a year to each infantry, pioneer and cavalry regiment in displacement of one British and one Viceroy&apos;s commissioned Indian officer. These Indian officers, who would hold King&apos;s commissions in His Majesty&apos;s Indian Land Forces, were to be obtained both from those Indian officers now holding Viceroy&apos;s commissions and from cadets from a new military college to be opened in India on the lines of Sandhurst.133. Under the scheme the annual entry of Indian officers would be about 110 during the first fourteen years&apos; period and 250 during the second period; while the total number of officers ultimately required would h* 6,864.No evidence has been laid before us to lead us to believe anything approaching that number of suitable candidates will be forthcoming. Under the system initiated during the war of granting King&apos;s Commissions to Indian cadets the supply of candidates is not sufficient to fill the small number of vacancies ten per annum  reserved for them. Nor have the selected Indian candidates shown themselves capable of attaining the educational and other standards required from British cadets, over whom they are given preferential treatment by being admitted to Sandhurst on passing a simpler examination.134. The security of India from* dangers without and within depends ultimately upon the efficiency and loyalty of the Indian Army. In the past the Indian Army has proved itself to be a highly efficient and trustworthy instrument for war. Its splendid record is mainly due to the ability and devotion to duty of its British officers, and to their extraordinary capacity for gaining the respect and affection of their men. We believe that the continued loyalty and efficiency of the Indian Army are, for the present, dependent upon the maintenance of the present proportion of British officers. This view appears to be shared by the Viceroy, who, in a telegram No. 22, dated the 7th January, 1922, informed us that, so long as the present proportion of British officers and the existing composition of regiments are retained, he had every confidence in the loyalty of the Indian Army.135. The latest scheme for Indianisation put forward by the Government of India is irreconcilable with that view. It aims at the total elimination of British officers from the Indian Army. We are unable to understand how the Government of India and their military advisers have been able to satisfy themselves that so revolutionary a change can prudently be introduced at the present time. We certainly cannot advise His Majesty&apos;s Government to take such a risk, nor do we think that it can ever be prudent to announce a programme requiring, even in the eyes of its supporters, 30 or 40 years for its execution. Much might happen in so long a period tonegative or change the conclusions so announced.136. Nor is the present moment well chosen for the announcement of so great a change. India is passing through a difficult period of transition. Public opinion is restless; and the measure of support upon which Government can count is doubtful. At such a time when the authority of Government is widely challenged, and sedition is openly preached, special caution is necessary in all that relates to the armed forces which are the ultimate basis of the authority of the King Emperor&apos;s Government, and of the safety of life and maintenance of order.137. The Indian claim has been that, as promised in Queen Victoria&apos;s Proclamation, there should be no racial discrimination against Indians. To this claim we fully assent; but that promise did not mean, and must not be interpreted to mean, that Indians are to be selected without regard to their fitness for the posts which they are called upon to fill. Until the capacity of India to supply a sufficient number of trained and suitable candidates has been proved, it would be extremely rash to embark on any large experiment or to pledge the future.
Conclusions.138.-(a.) We. are unable to approve the latest scheme of the Government of India. The most that we can recommend is that an experiment should be made by selecting four units of cavalry or infantry to be officered by Indians; and no promise should be made of further Indianisation unless and until that experiment has proved successful.(&amp;.) We concur in the proposal of the Government of India that a military college should be established in India for the training of Indian cadets destined for service in the Indian Army, in view of the admittedly unsatisfactory results of the experiment of admitting Indian cadets to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, without previous training.(28.) Contribution from Native States.139. In giving evidence before Lord Rawlinson&apos;s.Committee, several non-official witnesses expressed the view that the States should take a larger share in the defence of India, and should make larger contributions towards the maintenance of the Army. It must be borne in mind that we are under treaty obligations to protect many of the States in return for the cessions of territory made in years gone by. Moreover, several of the States at present make a substantial voluntary contribution to the defence of India by maintaining State forces numbering from 20,000 to 25,000, which will be. available for the defence of India generally in time of emergency.Conclusion.140. In these circumstances, we consider that the States cannot fairly be asked to make any further contribution towards the maintenance of the Army in British India.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.(1.) The Extent to which the Financial Resources of India are Capable of Bearing the Burden of a Large Military Expenditure.While the whole of the resources of Britain will in the future, as in the past, be available to support the Government of India in maintaining British supremacy in India if it is seriously threatened, it is the recognised duty of India to provide for her own defence against external and internal dangers in all but the gravest emergencies.(2.) The Position of the Government of India vis-a-vis the Imperial Government.(a.) We are opposed to the transfer in any measure to the War Office of the control now exercised by the Governor-General-in-Council over the Army in India.(p.) We are of opinion that the Government of India should be kept informed of all matters affecting India directly or indirectly, and that the Government of India should be consulted in all cases regarding ability to provide ways and means before any expenditure against the Army Budget is sanctioned.(3.) Relations between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and theArmy in India.-We share the view of Lord Esher&apos;s Committee.that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff with the approval of the Secretary of State for War should be the supreme military adviser to the Secretary of State for India, as he is to other Ministers of His Majesty&apos;s Government on questions of Imperial strategy; we consider that neither the Chief of the Imperial General Staff nor the Army Council should be allowed to exercise direct influence over the military policy of India or to interfere in regard to the administration of the Army in India.   The.
functions of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in regard to Indian military affairs should be purely advisory and consultative. The suggestions we make below as regards the relationship between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Secretary, Military Department, India Office, will, in our opinion, serve to ensure the maintenance of close relations between these two officers and at the same time to safeguard the constitutional position of the&apos;Government of India.(4.) Correspondence betiueen Commander-in-Chief and Chief of theImperial General Staff.While we consider it desirable that the Commander-in-Chief in India and the Chief of the Imperial General - Staff should keep constant and intimate touch with one another by direct correspondence, it is essential that the constitutional responsi-bility and control of the Government of India should be adequately safeguarded. We accordingly suggest that it should be definitely laid down that direct communica-tions between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Commander-in-Chief should be limited to correspondence regarding questions of intelligence, training, and preparations for war, and to routine matters and minor questions of organisation and equipment. It should not extend to questions of principle or policy, but should include any military information required by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to enable him to discharge his duties to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Executive action should not be taken on such correspondence. Proposals or final instructions to the Government of India affecting military policy and the distribution, organisation and equipment of Indian troops or their employment outside India must emanate from the Secretary of State for India alone. Copies of all direct communications between the Commander-in-Chief and Chief of the Imperial General Staff should be furnished to the Government of India, the India Office and the War Office.(5.) Appointment of the Commander-in-Chief.We suggest that the practice by which the Commander-in-Chief has always been recommended by the Secretary of State for War for appointment by the King, after consultation with the Secretary of State for India, might be improved constitutionally if the actual recommendation to the King were made by the Secretary of State for India with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War.(6.) Appointment of Secretary, Military Department, India Office.(a.) The Secretary, Military Department, India Office, should be the adviser of the Secretary of State for India on local military-questions, It is his duty to keep in close touch with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and to keep him thoroughly informed in regard to all matters that may concern him.(&amp;.) To enable him to advise the Secretary of State for India on administrative and on local strategic questions, it is essential that the Secretary, Military Depart-ment, should be an officer of Indian experience, and that he should have recently served on the General Staff at Army Headquarters in India.(c.) In order that he may be fully possessed of the views of the Government of India and the Commander-in-Chief, and in order that he may not lose touch with current developments, we recommend that he should visit India during his term of office.(7.) Appointment of Military Member of India Council.We recommend that, in order to maintain the representative character of the Secretary of State&apos;s Council, the appointment of a military officer of high rank as a Member of the India Council should be continued.(8.) High Command in India.We do not recommend that any change should be made at present, but we consider that as soon as the financial situation permits the question of creating a new appointment of a Civil Army Member should be reconsidered.
(9.) Status of the Air Officer Commanding Royal Air Force in India.While we are of opinion that existing arrangements have not proved satisfactory, we consider that a decision on this point should be deferred until a Report has been received from the senior Air Officer, who we recommend should be sent to India to study under the general direction of the commander-in-Chief the use of the Air Force in Indian warfare (see Section (21) of this Report).(10.) Organisation and Administration of the Army in India.(a.) As the scheme was approved in principle by the Secretary of State for India in his telegram of the 29th September, 1920, we have not thought it necessary to study it in detail. The principles on which their proposals are based are clearly set forth in the despatch of the Government of India, and we consider that the scheme of organisation in four commands is well adapted to the local conditions of India.(6.) In the interests of economy, the Army should be organised with strict regard to the limited nature of the duties that it may be called upon to discharge. We understand that that principle has been applied to the troops allotted to internal security duties, the organisation of which, both tactically and administratively, has been reduced to its simplest form. It may be that a simpler organisation for the higher tactical formations of the Field Army would meet the requirements of frontier defence. We recommend that the Government of India should consider the possibility of effecting economies by that means.(c.) We do not consider that we can usefully express an opinion as to the proposed terms of enlistment, rates of pay and conditions of service. Such matters must be dealt with by the Government of India.(d.) We are of opinion that the equipment of the Army in India should be thoroughly modern, and, with due regard to Indian conditions, should be in accordance with the present-dav patterns and standards of the British Army, so that when the Army in India has to co-operate with the British Army there may be no avoidable dissimilarities.(11.) Purpose, for which the Army in India is Maintained.We consider that the resolution of the Legislative Assembly which is, in substance, that the purposes for which the Army is maintained in India are (a.) The defence of India against external aggression; and (&amp;.) The maintenance of internal order,states concisely and accurately the objects for which the Army in India exists.(12.) Employment of the Army in India Overseas.(a.) We recognise that the Indian Army cannot be treated as if it were absolutely at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government for service outside India.(b.) We consider that the principle should be generally accepted that, except in the gravest emergency, the Indian Army should be employed outside the Indian Empire only after consultation with the Governor-General-in-Council.(13.) Provision of Oversea Garrisons in Time of Peace.We share the view of the Government of India that the Indian Army should not be required permanently to provide large oversea garrisons. We recommend that units required for such purposes should be maintained in addition to the establishment laid down for the Indian Army, and that the whole cost, direct and indirect, of recruiting and maintaining such units should be borne by His Majesty&apos;s Government, or by the dependency or colony requiring their services.
(14.) Forces required for Maintenance of Internal Order.In the face of the evidence given by the official witnesses who are responsible for the government of India, as well as by certain unofficial witnesses, we do not feel justified in recommending any reduction either in the aggregate number of troops allotted to internal security or in the proportion of British troops assigned to that duty.(15.) Proposal to raise Armed Police in the Provinces to replace Regular Troops.We recognise that the Government of India must be the judge as to the practicability of establishing such forces; but we suggest that this proposal requires further and detailed consideration by the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India.(16.) Substitution of the Territorial Force for Regular Troops.&quot; We do not desire to discourage the legitimate aspirations of Indians to take an active part in the defence of their country. We therefore recommend that the experiment of creating a Territoilal Force should be continued in selected localities, but that&apos; the number of units should be limited to twenty battalions with ancillary services, and that the maximum strength of the Force should not exceed 20,000 of all ranks. The movement should be kept under close supervision, and if there are any indications of an attempt to use the Force for political purposes or if a reasonable standard of military efficiency is not maintained the units affected should at once be disbanded.&quot;(17.) Substitution of the Auxiliary Force for Regular Troops.We share the view of Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee that from the nature of its terms of service the Auxiliary Force cannot replace regular troops for internal security duties, but we think that in time of internal disorder it will have considerable military value.(18.) Policy in regard to Waziristan.(a.) We are of opinion that at the present time it would not be safe to relax our control over Waziristan.(b.) As at present advised, we are unable to recommend for acceptance the latest proposals of the Government of India. We should like to see scheme (d) adhered to and the programme of road construction recommended by the General Staff completed; but, as communications are still passing between the Government of India and the Secretary of State on the subject, and other possibilities have, we understand, been suggested, we make no definite recommendations.(19.) Defence Against External Aggression.(a.) In present circumstances, financial and military, it is not possible to base the defence of the frontier on any plan of campaign involving an advance in force to or towards Kabul.(&amp;.) Our policy should be as far as possible to avoid committing the Army to military operations on a large scale in the. mountainous border region and to keep our Field Army concentrated and held in readiness either to strike heavily at the enemy&apos;s formed bodies as occasion offers or to turn and crush internal risings in India.(20.) Proportion of British to Indian Troops.We recommend that no change should at present be made in the proportion of British to Indian troops.
(21.) Co-operation of Air Force.We -recommend that the use of the Air Force in Indian warfare be further studied under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief by an Air Officer of high rank selected by the Secretary of State for Air on the advice of the Chief of the Air Staff; for we believe that this arm contains the possibility of great developments and should eventually render possible considerable economies.(22.) Proposed Re-establishment of Punjab Frontier Force.The question of the re-establishment of the Punjab Frontier Force is an administrative question which requires intimate knowledge of the Indian Army and familiarity with local conditions to enable an opinion to be formed in regard to it. We do not therefore offer any advice on the subject. The Government of India will,, of course, consider the views expressed by Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee.(23.) Possibility of Reduction of Troops in consequence of Improvements in military equipment, &amp;c.We share the view of Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee that there is at present no possibility of reducing the troops in consequence of improvements in arms and military equipment.(24.) Strength of A rmy in India.We are of opinion that no further reduction of the armed forces of the Crown, whether British or Indian, is immediately possible. We accept the recommendation of the Government of India, contained in their despatches No. 12 of February 1921 and No. 70 of August 1921, as to the establishment of the Army in India.(25.) Reinforcements from England.We recommend that the requirements of India for reinforcements from England should be reviewed. We suggest that they might-perhaps more appropriately be calculated in numbers of regiments and battalions rather than in numbers of divisions. In view of the unmartial character of many of the races of India, battalions composed of ex-service officers and men specially raised for the purpose might be equal to all the demands that would be made upon our troops in suppressing a rebellion.(26.)&apos;Disbandment of Inefficient Battalions.Having regard to the views expressed by the Government of India, we are unwilling to make a definite recommendation for the immediate disbandment of these battalions; but in view of the urgent need for economy in military expenditure, we recommend that the question should be reviewed again as soon as the political situation in India improves.(27.) Indianisation of the Indian Army.(a.) We are unable to approve the latest scheme of the Government of India. The most that we can recommend is that an experiment should be made by selecting four units of cavalry or infantry, to be officered by Indians; and no promise should be made of further Indianisation unless and until that experiment has proved successful.
(o.) We concur in the proposal of the Government of India that a military college should be established in India for the training of Indian cadets destined for service in the Indian Army, in view of the admittedly unsatisfactory results of the experi-ment of admitting Indian cadets to the Royal&quot; Military College, Sandhurst, without previous training.(28.) Contribution from Native States.We consider that the States cannot fairly be asked to make any further contribution towards the maintenance of the Army in British India.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN. WINSTON S.
