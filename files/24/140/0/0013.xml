[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.       November 1922.SECRET.CP. 4313.CABINET.I circulate to my colleagues the following telegram which 1 have received from the Government of India giving the views expressed by leading Muhammedans on the action ox the Angora National Assembly in depriving the Sultan of his temporal powers as Khalifa.PEEL.ISth November 1922.From Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India,liith Novendw 1922.There have not been published as yet, very many expressions of opinions by Indian Mohamedans. Uncertainty is still felt as regards the final intentions of the Angora Government and, until these have been placed beyond doubt, many Mohamedans are reluctant to commit themselves.As an illustration of this attitude we may mention that the Working Committee of the Jamiat-ul-Ulema (Council of learned men) at Delhi have declared their inability, in view of the suspicion attaching to news coming through foreign sources, to give a clerical view of the separation of the spiritual and temporal powers of the Khalifa, though trusting that Indian Muslims would remain unshaken in their support of Angora, and retain full confidence in the Kemalists.Of the opinions f,o far expressed the following appear to he the most important, but it is impossible at present to indicate the precise weight to bo attached to each of them :  (1) Hakim Ajmal Khan and Ansari (Muslim Congress leaders), in a joint manifesto just issued, while generally endorsing the Aga Khan&apos;s view, declare that the alarmist view taken in London, about the decision of Angora, did not deceive Indian Muslims, who, instead of regarding it with apprehension, would actually rejoice at the transfer of power from the Sultan Khalifa to the National Assembly, which would form the chief bulwark of the Khilafat and. strengthen rather than weaken its hands. The office of the Khalifa was never hereditary. They hoped that the proposed conference of the Islamic world in Egypt would place its seal of approval on the election of a Khalifa by the Turkish people,(2) Chotani, President of the Central Khilafat Committee, in an interview with the Associated Press last month, said that what the National Assembly at Angora decided must be conclusive for the Muslim world at large. He strongly opined that, according to Islamic law, the Sultan should be elected, and concluded by saying &quot; We have full confidence in the doings oi; Mustapha Kemal and the Angora Assembly.&quot;(3) Maulavi Wahed Hossain, Vice-President of the Khilafat Committee, Calcutta, has written that there is nothing in the resolution of the Turkish National Assembly which contravenes the principles ot the Shariat (Mahomedan law). The Khalifa of Islam has no personal authority ; his authority is derivative, and vested by the people who elect him as their Khalifa fcr protecting them and their religion. The present incumbent will, no doubt, be divested of the spiritual and temporal power ; but another worthy person would be installed on the Masnad-I-Khiiafat (Seat of the Khali ), and would be vested with powers by the Turkish people. The National Assembly vests the Khalifa with temporal power by its announcement that the Turkish Government will be the chief bulwark of the Khilafat.(4) Maulavi Abdul Majid Sherar, Vice-President of the Madras Khilaiat Committee, and editor of the Quami report, said in an interview, &quot; We have no quarrel with Mustapha Kemai or the Angora National Assembly for the innovations they have introduced, or are contemplating to introduce ; any Khalifa or Sultan can ,be dethroned ; but the question of the separation of the KhiJafat from the Executive Government is a question on which the Ulema (learned men) differ. The majority of the Sunni Sect hold that such a separation is not permissible; the history of Islam supports this contention.&quot; He suggested that the Angora Government might assist the Khalifa in the exercise of his spiritual powers, by establishing a Moslem League of Nations presided over by a Khalifa other than the Sultan of Turkey, and, whenever the occasion arose, the Khalifa would call upon the Moslem States to defend the Holy Places against aggressive, attacks.   As regards the hereditary principle,5ss7      100   11/22
their religion prohibited sudden departures from established practice, and a clear-case must be made out against the system. So far as he had studied the present situation, the Angora party could condemn the present Sultan, but not the present system.(5) Dr. Abdnlla Suhrawarcly, M.L.O., Bengal, who was formerly at Constanti-nople, said he did not believe that Kemal Pasha aimed at the severance of the temporal and spiritual powers of the Khalifat, but rather desired the severance of the rulership of Turkey (Sultanate) from the Headship of Islam (Khilafat). The Khilafat, liberated from the restraints and burdens of the Sultanate, would be-stronger than before, the Khalifa would be enabled to claim the allegiance to his spiritual suzerainty of other Moslem States, and would have the support of the Turkish State in his demands for the maintenance of the dignity of the office of the Khalifa. If the object of the National Assembly of Angora be to vaticanise, and to. make the Khalifa a captive in Constantinople and a puppet pontiff, then the Angora Assembly would be guilty of the very thing with which the Indian Moslems have charged the Allies.(6) Dr. Hussan Suhrawardy, M.L.C., Bengal, said that the consensus of Indian Moslem opinion required the Khalifa, in his person, not only to be a spiritual leader,, but also a strong and independent monarch, powerful enough to safeguard the prestige of Islam. Any attempt to dissociate the Khalifa from his temporal power would be regarded with a great deal of misgiving by Moslems.(7) Maulavi Ahmad Ali, Member of the Central Khilafat Committee, said that the Khalifa could not be shorn of his temporal power, and, if the Sultan would agree-to that the Angora National Assembly would be justified in refusing to recognise him any longer as the Khalifa. The appointment of the Khalifa by election had the sanction of the Shariat (Mahomedan law). Judging from the reports of the activities of the Angora Government, which had, up till now, aimed at elevating the dignity of the Khilafat, it would be too early to say whether there would be any necessity of convening a conference, representative of the Moslem world, for the election of the Khalifa ; further, it was doubtful how far such an action would be practicable.(8) Abdul Kassem, M.L.A., said that the Sultan is essential for the Khilafat ;. the Khalifa is Defender of the Faith, and, as such, should be possessed of full temporal power. The idea of depriving&apos; the Sultan of his temporal power is repugnant to Islam. He thought that it was the duty of the Muhammadan world to bring-the full force of its united opinion on the Angora Government to maintain the Khilafat in its present dignified position.(9) Maulavi A. K. Fazl [Jl Haq, while reserving his opinion until more infor-mation had been received, said that any interference by Non-Moslem powers, with whatever Kemal Pasha might be doing in Turkey, would be resented by Moslems throughout India.(10) KhWaja Hasam Nizami, of the famous Moslem Shrine of Nizani-ud-dih Aulia, Delhi, says the decision of the Angora National Assembly, to reinstate the elected Khalifa instead of the hereditary Sultan, is a most happy piece of news, and js in full conformity with Islamic Command men Is.Conservative Mohameclan opinion is undoubtedly perturbed at the idea that the Khalifa may be deprived of his temporal power. On the other hand, extremist Mohamedan opinion, and those Mohamedans whose real object has always been the maintenance of a strong Turkey as the bulwark of Islam are endeavouring to reassure Mohamedans in India on the subject of action of the Angora Government, and will work hard to reconcile Mohamedari opinion to whatever may be the ultimate decision of the Angora Government. Newspapers, such as The Independent and The Bombay Chronicle, are writing; from this point of view, and the Urdu Nationalist Press declares full confidence in Mustapha Kemal and the National Assembly, and welcomes an elected Khalifa. It is too early as yet to say what attitude will be taken up by the majority of Mohamedans should the intentions attributed to the Angora Government be carded out, but the tendency of Islam is to accept a fait accompli when it is the result of Moslem action, and, in. view of strong influences which, for obvious reasons, are working in this direction, it is probable that Mohamedan opinion will eventually find means of reconciling itself to the changes foreshadowed. The opinions quoted above, however, should be published without comment, for we feel sure you Avill agree that it is undesirable that anything should be done which might lend colour to the charge that the British Government is attempting to influence Mohameclan opinion in India against the Angora Government.
