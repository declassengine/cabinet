Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1922.SECRET.cp. 4351.CABINET.GOVERNOR-GENERAL  OF THE  IRISH FREE STATE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I circulate to my colleagues a copy of a letter which I received from Mr. T. M. Healy, K.C., two days before his name was submitted to the King for the appointment as Governor-General of the Irish Free State.DEVONSHIRE.Colonial Office,December 9, 1922.Grand Hotel, London,Dear Duke of Devonshire, December 2, 1922.In thanking you for the great courtesy shown me to-day, I think it right togive certain assurances which I think your Government might fairly look for.While I do not believe there is anyone of the existing Irish Executive who wouldhe a party to any breach of the Treaty, or who even in thought contemplates a I departure from it, still, as Ministries and Ministers change, it is my purpose to \ keep a watchful eye on Bills and Amendments or proposed Amendments to Bills \ which may in any way conflict with the Treaty, or may be such as may affect the i relations of His Majesty with foreign States or other parts of the Empire. My I plan would be immediately to apprise the Secretary of State of any such Bill or 1   Amendment, so that, if thought desirable, representations might be made to theFree State Government, or that instructions should be sent me for the reservation I of any Bill falling within the above categories in pursuance of clauses in the I Patent of the Governor-General, which your Grace was good enough to show I   me to-day.My hope and belief is that nothing will arise to call for such intervention. To borrow the Prime Minister&apos;s words, I shall strive to make the Treaty observed in &quot; letter and spirit.&quot;I remain, your Grace,Very faithfully, (Signed) T. M. HEALY.i iI   The Right honourable the Duke of Devonshire,Secretary of State for the Colonies.[9196]
