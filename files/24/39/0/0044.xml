rrflksPQfiJMKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC !L\JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET. 230 -                                   CABINET, ^uG.T. - 33^4THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. Observations by the Secretary.The creation of the League of Nations takes a prominent place in the war aims of the Allies, as. recently set forth by the Prime Minister and.President Wilson.     Up to now, however, no definite scheme for such a League has been put forward.     I venture tentatively,to suggest below the lines on which development might take place,2.    In his speech in the House of Commons on December 20,1917* the Prime Minister suggested that by the setting up of an Inter-Allied Council at Versailles, the Allies had, for the first time, treated the machinery of the League of Nations.     He pointed out that, at Versailles&quot;nations have come together to set up a complete machine which is a clearing-house, not merely in military matters and in naval matters, but for financial, for economic, for shipping, for food purposes, and for all the other things that are essential to the life of the nations.&quot;3*    It is a fact that machinery of the kind the Prime Minister indicated is in existence, and it.is clear that in the last resort where questions cannot be settled by the more detailed machinery, they will come up for decision at the Supreme War Council at Versailles.     As an example, it must be mentioned that, at the First Meeting of the Supreme War Council, the question of financial assistance to Greece, which was in a thoroughly unsatisfactory position, was raised, and the general lines of the settlement decided.     This is a precedent for probable future action of the same kind.4,   At the present moment, the standing facilities for con-ference among the Allies are as follows.     At Versailles reside the Permanent Military Advisers to the Supreme War Council.      In London there is to be a Supreme Naval War Council, which will meet for the first time next week, and provision has been made, for a permanent staff working in connection w:o.h it.     In London also there is the Inter-Ally&apos;Council established at the request of the Government of the United States of America to discuss and decide, so far as purchases in the United States of America arc concerned, upon the relative financial, supply, and transport needs of each cf the Allies, on which the British Government are represented by General Smuts, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, and Lord Buckmaster.     The Inter-Ally Council has held five meetings in London and one in Paris.     Also, in London there is the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement, where many details of Inter-Allied purchases in Groat Britain are arranged.   At the last groat Conference of the Allies, concluded in Paris on tho 3rd December, 1917, a new Inter-Allied organisation was decided on, with tho object of co-ordinating the action of their Allies in regard to means of maritime transport and tho use of tho supplies which they control in common for the pursuit of the
War, and steps aj*r new &quot;being taken for oarrying out this deoi At the same Conference it was decided to create a Permanent Ceimittee of Munitions and Aeronautics in Paris, composed, if possible, of Ministerial reprcsontatives of each of the large Allied countries.     In connection with this Permanent Comnu.;. Committee a Bureau of Statistics exists in Paris.     It is understood that thoro is no regular Blockade Council, hut the is very close co-operation &quot;between all the Allies in regard to blockade matters;     In London there is the Wheat Executive an* tho newly-formed Hitrates Executive, and similar organise tions arc understood to be in contemplation for other commodiProm the above short summary, it will bo cecn that p maricht facilities for consultation on practically all extern?, matters, exist between the Allies. Politics are dealt with a frequent Ministerial Conferences held in Paris, London, or Roi.er 1 Military matters at Versailles. Naval matter-: in Lt don. Finance, transport, munitions, and supplies ir London, Paris;, and at Wellington.6.     It ie suggested that this somewhat loose organisatic which has f*rown up to meet the needs of the   Allies first in one saatter, and then in another, contains the nuoleus of the machinery of a League of Nations.     In the Political Councils of Ministers is reproduced, as it were, a Cabinet of Eat ions. In the great Conferences, which mee&apos;t from time to time in Par there is some analogy, if rather a jremote one, to a Parliamer of Nations.     Possibly, however, the Parliament of Nations oould be better constructed out of some development of the International Inter-Parliamentary Association which has been fairly active;during the War. and has held some useful discussions.       In the several Committees referred to above are reproduced International organs not altogether dissimilar in their functions from the 0-jvt.orient Departments of the State,     The International Committee, like the Government department, settles matterB within its own orbit, but the moment any great question of policy is involved, or the roomer: the question overflows from the orbit of the particular Committee into the orbit of one or other of the Committees, i&apos; has to be brought to the higher Political Council.7.     The question arises whether the tjme has not now come to knit these organisations together more closely with a view to the formation of a veritable League of lTat.iens. The first step required would seem to be be airo-rge that all the Permanent Secretariats should sit in one place.     Where this should be would be a matter for some cor si delation,     Th: difforent organisations are at present divided more or less equally between London and Paris.     In neither city is it probable that any building could be found which would house the whole of these organisations.
231The palaoe at Versailles, owing to its size, naturally suggests itself as a possible centre, although it would probably require a good many alterations to render it suitable as the great Government Office of the League of Nations.8.     Supposing the whole of the Inter-Allied machinery referred to above were combined in one building, or in one place, the further development of the League of nations ought not to be difficult. Dur-lag the War it would become the meeting place for consultation between the nations on&quot; all matters relating to every branch of Inter-Allied war activity.   Although it would not be necessary for the smaller nations, or for those of the larger nations which are taking a less active part in the :7ar, to be represented on the same scale as the Great Powers, they would have to be called in when questions affect-ing them were under discussion, just as M. Venezelos, as already men-tioned, was called to the Supreme War Council at the beginning of December, and just as Belgium will presumably be represented there when the discussion of the re-organisation of the Belgian Army is brought up at the next meeting.9. Moreover, little difficulty should be found in compelling neutrals * to come to the League of Nations to discus-s their relations.    There is no reason, for example, why negotiations with the Northern neutrals in regard to supplies should not take place at the League of Nations, where all countries affected rsrould be^ represented.   If Chile requires shipping for her nitrates, or/irgentixe wishes to sell her wheat crop, there is no reason why the negotiations should not be entrusted to the League of Nations.   In fact, it should be possible to unite into the League of Nations not only those neutrals who ha^e broken off re- ations with the enemy, and who, therefore, have a common bond of union with the Allies, but even those nations who have preferred to remain entirely neutral.1-6. By such means there would be concentrated under the League of Na-tions the whole of the machinery of the economic offensive,,   The League of Nations might be used to conduct the eventual peace negotiations with the enemy, who -vould be told that if he wished to have access to the markets of the outer world, he must join the League of Nations which already controlled all trans-oceanic supplies and their trans-portation, and must conform to its tenets.11. It is, however, not from the point of view of it3 value as a war instrument that the League of Nations is generally advocated, but ra-ther as a means in the future of keeping the peace.    The transition of the League from a War to a Peace footing would be arranged by the incorporation of our present enemies&quot;&apos; and- of those neutral States which had not yet formally participated in its operations.    At first, there would be much business to transact in clearing up the detailed questions left over from the Peace Conference, and in allotting the comparatively limited amounts of raw materials and transport.   Grad-ually, however, it should be possible to concentrate many other in-temational matters in the League of Nations, such as, the reg-ula-tion of international postal, telegraph, wireless, railway, shipping, and aerial communications; mutual arrangements in regard to finan-cial and commercial matters, tariffs, aliens, education, and teeh-nical developments of all kinds.IS. It is suggested that very great advantages would be gained by the frequent meetings of Ministers of the various nations on such matters. In this respect^it is only necessary to recall our own experience in the present^War.    In the early days of the Inter-Allied Oonferenoes, business was handicapped by formality, by lack of personal acqualn&quot;^-ance, and, to some extent, by a sort of suspicion of the other natrons1

Without wishing, to exaggerate these factors,there is no doubt thai the atmosphere of these Conferences has gradually improved, and that business is easier to transact than-formerly.    The principal&apos; reason for this improvement .is that the Ministers and Officials con-cerned have got to know one another.   They have met, not only at the great Political Conferences, but at the innumerable technical and departmental Conferences that have taken place throughout the War, and at the. social gatherings arranged in connection with these Con-ferences.    The result is a much greater mutual understanding.   So it will be with the League of Nations.   If the Meetings only occur on those rare occasions when international crises of the very first im-portance arise, formality and mutual suspicion are bound to stand in the way of business.   If, on the contrary, the nations become aecustr. omed to transacting their business, not only on great, but on minor matters, at some common centre where there is a permanent Internation al Bureau, and where they constantly meet the Ministers and Officials of   fcther nations, a continuous personal contact will be established which will enable business even of the greatest magnitude to be trans acted more easily than it otherwise would.   In fact, the right at-mosphere for business on which so much depends will be created.13.   It is suggested, however, that if the scheme is to take shape there should be a Permanent Resident Minister, an actual Member of the Government of each of the Greater States at Versailles, who would represent the Prime Minister when questions of secondary importance were being discussed, and would join.in- the various discussions be-tween Ministers, at the Heads of tho Departments on matters of tsch-nioal policy, and would keep his Government fully informed of all that was going on, and would Head the Mission of each State.14.   Whether the above scheme Is a practicable proposition or not, it is suggested that tho Allied Governments ought, at least, to make up their minds as to what they do mean by the League of.Natiens. If they do not do so, it is very probable that, at the peace nogotia-tions, they will be presented with a Geiman-mads scheme, simple in appearance, but really designed to wreck the whole project.(signed) M.P.A.HANKSY.
