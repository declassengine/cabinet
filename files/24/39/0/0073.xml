His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)(This Document is the Property ofSECRETIntelligence Bureau Department of Information GDW/004New Peace Move &quot;by Danish Socialists.WEEKLY REPORT ON DENMARK,&amp;AN. 16, 191^.IVDuring the last week of November a leading article appeared in the&quot;Socialdemokratenrt entitled &quot;A new Danish Peace Initiative&quot;. It was stated therein that in order to accelerate the coming of a general peace the Danish Social Democracy had telegraphed to M, Troelstra, the wellknown Dutch Socialist, and simultaneously sent him a detailed communication by post, requesting the Nether--lands Members of the International Socialist Bureau to try to hasten the convocation of an International Peace Conference at Stockholm.    It transpired that the initiator of this step was Mr St aiming, one of the Ministers without portfolio now in the Danish Cabinet.    He is also Chairman of the Social Democratic Party.    In passing it may be remarked that the Socialist Party in Denmark has all through the war been notoriously pro-German. The reason for this is not clear, but it is by no means certain that some of the leaders are not in the pay of the International Jew financiers who, behind the scenes, have played so important a part in the war.     Mr Staining1s action met with strong disapproval at the hands of the Socialist Press in Sweden, notably from Mr Branting!s organ the &quot;Socialdemokraten&quot;.     This induced Mr Stanning to inform the Swedish newspaper that the Stockholm Conference has for object the making not of a separate but of a general peace. It is pointed out by a prominent Danish newspaper that it isintolerable that a Cabinet Minister should have a private
*r . 2. &apos;foreign policy.     It is indeed merely possible because the respon-sible Ministers do not dare to take measures against a member of theBo0ialist party.     It is noticeable that the German Socialist&quot;Vorwarts&quot; also warmly approves of the proposed Conference.     Havingregard to the notorious leanings of the Danish Social Democrats itseems more probable that Mr. Standing was incited to meve in thismatter from Berlin.     The incident furnishes yet another object lessonas to the origin pf these peace-kites.The Dispute between Denmark and Iceland.For some time it has been known that at a Crown Council held to-wards the end of November, Mr. Jon Msgnusson, the Icelandic Minister,submitted a claim, passed by the Alting (Icelandic Parliament) urgingthat the Icelandic Flag, the use of which was authorised in 1915  orIceland and her territorial waters should now be recognised uncon-ditionally as the Commercial Flag of the Island.     The publicationof a full report of what took place at the Crown Council was deferneduntil the return of the Icelandic Minister to Reykiavik.   It had nowappeared in the Danish Press.     It shows that the claim to fly theIcelandic Flag is supported by the unanimous desire of the peopleof the Island.     It seems unnecessary to jive the text of what passedat the Council, but the decision of the King of Denmark after hearingthe Prime Minister and the Minister for Iceland was as follows&quot;I am unable to grant the request submitted by the Minister for Iceland, but I wish to add that in cases where Icelandic and Danish views differ from each other a general discussion, no matter under v/hat form it takes plaoe, is more likely than a debate on a separate question to lead to the harmony which ought to be tha basis of the relations between the two Countries&quot;,.There seems little doubt that Iceland desires to break away fromDenmark, probably retaining a Common Monarch.     She has,accordingto the last available statistics a population of 85,188 inhabitants.Her imports (1914) amounted to  301,333 and her exports to  555,944.
- t? - -It is improvable that Denmark will take any steps to prevent Iceland attaining her independence should she desire to do so.     The question which arises is whether with a population smaller than say Bournemouth a separate State c&amp;n flourish.The Danish &quot;Socialderookraten&quot; think that an independent Icelandwould fall under the influence of Great Britain and maintains thatdeepthe latter has/designs in that direction.     As the newspaper in question is pro-German in tendency perhaps this extraordinary notion has been suggested from Berlin. Germano-Danish Trade Agreement.The negotiations which have lately taken place between German and Danish delegates with the object of arranging an exchange of neces-saries between the two countries have been Brought to a satisfactory conclusion.     Denmark is to be furnished with coal, lubricating oils, iron, steel, ship-building materials and salt, while Germany is to receive agricultural produce.     The arrangement is for four months.Early in the war, probably in 19&amp;5, the combined executive of theCopenhagen Trade Tfciion, and the Danish Social Democratic Union, ob-tained a special export license for coal from the German authorities.Eventually this developed into the Danish Workers Fuel Co. Ltd. inJune 1916, but delivery did not commence till early in 1917.   Theedcompany was administer/(under German supervision) by prominent pol-itical leaders of the Danish Social Democratic P^-rty including the Minister Standing and Mr. Carl F. Madsen.     The turnover is stated in one year to amount to  5,330,000.     In the Norwegian section it is noted that a similar concession was offered to       Norwegian Socialists, on condition that they would write favourably of the German Government, and try to get the British fish monopoly abolished, but the offer was refused.     What the &quot;quid pro quo&quot; in Denmark is, has not yet been revealed, but one may rest assured that it is something on
the same lines.     This dual was the work of Dr. A. Helphand whc would seem to he the same person as Herr Parvus, who wrote a new war pamphlet entitled &quot;the Balance Sheet of the War&quot;   which hast&quot;been translated into Danish and published in the &quot;Socialdemoferat&quot;. probably as as offset to the German action, America has released a certain amount of food stuffs for Danish consumption.
