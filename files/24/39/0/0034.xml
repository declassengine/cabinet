My dear General,*      *      *      *      *      *    .. 4      *      *.      *      *      *&apos; The papers, today say that an armistice has &quot;been concluded up till the 12th January.-on the Russian Pront,   The terms of this armistice, are not yet known for Trotski!s diplomacy is j)ust as secret as ours.   However we may he sure that the Bo die has walked round the Russian socialists in their gallery attempt to protect the Interests of the allies, for the Russian Delegation would not have dared to return t6 Petrograd without the armistice in their pockets.   They shriek about the rights of all peoples but they very well know that the animal element here simply insists on peace and does not care a damn for what other peoples think if it gets peace.   The one certain fact of the situation is that no one in Russia wiir fire another shot at the enemy. no-matter what we do.The French talk a great deal about support to the &quot;faithful elements in Russia&quot;.,   There are no faithful elements,;:&apos;   The Letts in the north are&apos; as much anti-war as the Russians.,The Poles have only some 12-000 men under Dovbor-Musnitski. They want to collect their nationals who are scattered throughout the army.   They say they could get 200,000 if we guaranteed financial support.,   I think they might get 50?000 but what use would 50,000 men be round Minsk with their right and* as I also believe, their left in the air,   Besides the Government has started a propaganda against the Poles as a counter-revolutionary organisation &apos;on the ground that they have no committees but are sane soldiers.   The unfortunate Dovbor-Musnitskr will have to give way.   Poles worry us to know what they are to do.   I will certainly not encourage them to any resistance for I try to see facts as they are and do not see how we can help them if they take up a strong attitude relying on our advice.The Poles might be some use if the Rada could do something but though the Rada sends sympathetic telegrams to allied Ambassadors, its members are quite powerless to make the animal elements of Little Russia fight.     The Ukrain units have not been really formed but like the Poles are scattered through the Russian army.   I think there are only some 5 Ukrain Regiments at Kiev which are hopelessly indiscipiined.   They consist of men who volunteered to join them in order to get away from their old unito in the fighting line.   The Ukrain programme is practically  &apos; Bolshevik, it is wholly Bolshevik as far as we are concerned.   The tRada itself has passed a vote by 25 to 0 to take part in the peace negotiations.,- The unfortunate,Rumanian army has had to join in the armistice,Kaledin has some of the best men in Russia with him on the Don.   He has Kornilov, Danikin. Alexyeev, Erdeli    the best of the generals,    He has the chief Kadets such as Milyukov and has Rodsianko and Guchkov, but he has very little real force.   It is-hard to say exactly what, but say about 5,000 infantry and some 10,000 sabres,&apos;  The Cossacks are rotten fighters but better than the Bolsheviks,   The South Eastern Alliance covers a wide stretch of territory as it includes the Ural, Orenburg, Don and Astrakhan Cossacks, the Kalmiks and the Mohamedan trSbes of the Caucasus together with the peasants of the Stavropol Goverranent.Kaledin
Kaledin will have eventually such force as is represented rby the Cossacks of these several &quot;armies&quot; hut he has to collect them from the front.   He has not tried to do so, so far from motives of patriotism not wishing to denude the front more than necessary.   There seems no doubt that in the next month many of the Cossack units will return to their homes, and such as are on the S.W, and Rumanian Fronts will probably be allowed to return with their arms,   1 am not so sure about the others on the Northern and Western Fronts, but the Bolsheviks will hardly be able to deprive them of their horses which are their personal property and arms can be had anywhere in the Caucasus for the buying,1 have met Kaledin several times,   I should imagine his policy to be to form a --nucleus of the decent elements in Russia to save the country eventually,&apos; out he is not going to make active war against the Central Powers,   I am not sure that he will be able to hold his own against the rest of Russia for many weeks, I am pretty sure he will not unress he gets allied money and above all   * allied direction and advice.   His present attitude is to defend his own country and in that the Cossacks are solid with him,Kaledin cannot get his Cossacks back till Russia has madepeace,X think he can be made of use to us to oppose complete German exploitation of the country,   I have said that I think the Germans will get very little supplies out of Russia for about 0 months after peaee and this is the opinion of nearly all the Russians I have been able to asko   But af the wa^ is going on till after the next harvest, Germany will get everything -she wants from Russia, unless we support our friends in the country.   Such support will have to be realfi   Our Embassies would have to be x^recalled from Petrograd and American and Japanese troops will have * to be pushed along the Siberian Railway,   If we took: decisive steps like this there would really be very little opposition,   Onc^e It was kno?m that v/e were helping the South Eastern Alliance, the Rada would come to terms with them and the feme together would very , soon starve out Northern Russia by shutting off grain and coal and oil.3   In this way we would once more get a solid Russia anti-German, I simply won!t believe that the Japanese have not their price and that they would not send 3 or 4 divisions for certain compensation in the Par Bast,   Amerioan troops should come with them.If some such pclicy as this is not followed, the Germans will restore order instead of us and having restored order they v/ill get all they require from Russia after a short interval and there is a danger of Russia becoming economically and politically, their slave after the war.It is impossible for us to support Kaledin and Go, as long *as we are here.   Without allied support Kaledin will lose all power,*      *      *      *      *      *      *     ,*      *      *      *      *Comrade Trotski wants a long ami it ice to prepare his universal revolution, but his army is melting away and the Boche can distate what terms he likes on the 12th January when the -armistice lapseat  He will not be very hard on him beoause he never knows quite where he is with the Russian and fears he might perhaps stumble on a strata of patriotism.

unfortunate Hofman sit down for three days between the Jews Yoffe and Rosenfeldt who represent all that he most detests.Of course Trotski may not last, but that does not make a bit of difference to use for no Government Kadet or otherwise will make Russia fight again in this v/ar.Well If we wait and see.   The armistice which lapses on; the 12th January will be prolonged for perhaps a week or two and will then give way to peace,-   Then presumably our Ambassadors will be recalled and most of us soldiers, hut we will have to work Russia as we worked Rumania when neutral to counteract the Boche influence and prevent hirn from getting supplies.   The question Is whether we do much good by remaining here these six weeks or so&amp; w*e cannot influence events in the slightest.   General Niessel says we must remain &quot;pour embeter les   russese,!   I think this is rot. Our remaining here delays any arrangement of a whole hearted character being come to with Kaledinc************Yours -sincerely j,(Sgd,)   Alfred Knox.
Hote on Colonel Langlois&apos; interview with D.M.I. January lltti.Colonel Langlois returned from Russia to-day and called to give D*M,I,. impressions of conditions&apos;obtaining there, 1 He consider that the situation is extremely bad and that there is no hope whatever cf Ru3siaTs failing to make a separate pea^Qw] He considers that the political conditions in Southern Russia  :; are as bad as in the North, and that there is very little likeli-j hood of our getting any assistance.   In his opinion. General Berthelofs knowledge of Russia is very limited and there is no cause for his optimistic reports.   He says that there are large quantities of supplies In South Russia and that If there should be some difficulty in reorganizing Russian railways, there would be none at all in shipping supplies from Odessa to the Danube or to Rumanian?psrts and thence sending it by rail te Germany and Aust ria-Hmigary.Colonel Langlois doubted Lenin and Trotski being ixk German pay.   Ha eosMders the former merely a fanatic with a very limited outlook and whose ambition it had always been to be the man furthest to the left of any in the world.   Trotski, on the other hand is, in his opinion, much more able, but his main aim also, is to produse anarchy in all countries.   All the hangers-on of these men are probably in German pay, and most of them are old employ^fOf the Russian Imperial Secret Police bought by the Germans.There is no forae in Russia at the present timo but a negative one,   No one wishes to light or indeed, to do anything elss.   The reports of the fighting between the Bolsheviks and their opponents have been grossly exaggerated.   When Kerensky took Tsarkoe only 6 men were wounded.   The defenders of the Winter Palase surrendered after 4 oazmon shots had been firod, of which 5 failed to hit the palace stall and one knocked off a chip from the Gorniue.   Colonel Langlois considered that the Germans were undoubtedly playing a dangerous game in supporting the forces of anarchy, but their own internal conditions were so bad that it was necessary for them to take any risk in order   &apos; to protect themselves from the side of Russia and if passible to draw supplies from thGrs.     They had susoeeded in destroying completely the Russian Army and they were now doing the same to Russian commerce.     There was no doubt that many people in Russia welcomed their coming as the sole way of ultimately , re-establishing the country.     Many o-f the Bolsheviks were working for the eventual re--establishment of the Monarchy a&amp;d Golonel Langlois had heard it stated that the Germans intended to put the Czarevitch on the throne with a German prince -probably Prince Leopold of Bavaria as Regent.
