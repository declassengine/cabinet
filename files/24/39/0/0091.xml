[This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Maiestys government.!Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1918.SECRET.\ NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 34. Week ended Y2ih January, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.The weather in the North Sea has prevented minelaying operations during the North. Sea. week.During the period 16th to 29th December, 1917, R.N.A.S. Squadron No. 8, attached Handera to the R.F.C. in France, has carried out 29 offensive patrols, 12 escorts to corps photo-graphic machines and 55 nights in pursuit of hostile artillery machines.   The work of yjance. the latter has been effectively hindered, the percentages of interference having risen from 41 to 71 per cent, of those observed.   Fifteen combats took place, in 4 of which the enemy machine was driven down out of control, in 2 cases completely.   We had no casualties.The weather has been generally unsuitable for flying, but a large number of patrols and reconnaissances have been carried out from Dunkirk.During the night of 8th-9th January, in heavy weather and snowstorm, the destroyer Casualties. &quot; Racoon &quot; ran on some rocks on the North coast of Ireland and was lost with all hands.During the night of 12th-13th January, in a Northerly gale with heavy snow, the destroyers &quot; Opal&quot; and &quot; Narborough&quot; are reported to have run ashore near the Pentland Skerries. Wreckage has been found in.Wind Wick Bay and 1 survivor has been rescued.Submarine &quot; G. 8 &quot; has failed to return from patrol in the Kattegat.The armed trawler &quot; Miranda &quot; has gone ashore in the Orkneys, but the crew were rescued.The armed drifter &quot; Girl Gladys&quot; has been lost on passage between Falmouth and Holyhead.The Geneva Red Cross report that they have received another list of 61 men saved after the naval action of December 12th. They belong to the crews of the destroyer &quot; Partridge,&quot; the armed trawlers &quot; Tokio&quot; and &quot; Livingstone,&quot; and the British s.s. &quot; Cordova.&quot;ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week 15 or 16 large enemy submarines have been located, from 7 to 11 Submarines of which were operating in waters to the westward of the British Isles.   Three of the operating, converted Deutschland type were amongst those at sea during the week, one in the vicinity of the Azores, one in the Atlantic outward bound and one off the African Coast south of the Canaries.The bad weather which prevailed throughout the week rendered attack difficult, whether upon submarine *or merchant ship, and doubtless largely accounts for the reduction in the number of attacks recorded.(C896)  Wt.     55  1/18  H&amp;S

This week&apos;s results following the comparatively heavy
losses of the two previous weeks demonstrate the necessity of taking a long view in regard to mercantile losses. Too great importance should not be attached to the figures for any particular week.The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and Losses of of losses by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British Merchant British. Steamships of over 500 tons gross register ; and the table in Appendix II shows by trades ^^g^3 as regards such ships the percentage of tonnage sunk by enemy action to tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last four weeks,.The percentage of losses to sailings this week as regards tonnage employed in Overseas trades is only .40 as compared with 1.09 last week: the corresponding figure for the week ended November 10th being .35. The losses during the week in Coasting and Cross-Channel traffic were very low, with the result that as regards all United Kingdom traffic the percentage of losses to sailings is this week .29 as against 1.33 last week, and .32 in the week ended November 10th.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British Merchant Vessels Areas in sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the which last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine classified according to areas. vessels lost.It will be observed that the area of greatest activity has again been the English Channel and the entrance to the Irish Sea, but losses heavier than of late have been experienced in the Bay of Biscay area this week.The average number of enemy attacks made upon British Merchant Ships of over Average 500 tons gross register in the period February to July, 1917, was 188 per month, and in monthly the period August to December, 1917,. was 121 per month, this reduction representing attacks in a decrease of 35.64 per cent.1917.The following table shows the average monthly losses by enemy action in the periods AverageFebruary to July and August to December, 1917, of British Merchant Steamships of over monthly500 tons gross register grouped as to Area and Trade :  losses ,0 . grouped asto Area andTrade.

Allied and Neutral losses, and showing separately the losses of the principal Allies and of Norway, who has sustained greater losses than all other Neutrals combined.The diagram demonstrates that the ratio of British to the sum of Allied and Neutral losses has remained almost constant throughout the period of unrestricted submarine warfare, while in the month of January, 1917, before the unrestricted warfare commenced, the. British losses were relatively less.It will also be noticed that the comparatively heavy Norwegian losses which took place during the early months of unrestricted warfare now show a tendency to decline, while the French and Italian losses are relatively larger. This is probably accounted for on the one hand by a considerable diminution of the Norwegian Mercantile Fleet and on the other hand by increasing submarine activity in the Mediterranean, where Italian and French ships are largely employed.Total losses      The total number of merchant vessels lost by enemy action since the outbreak of since out-   war down to the end of 1917 is 5,001, their aggregate tonnage being 10,124,451.   Of these, 2,501 (or exactly. one-half) with an aggregate tonnage of 6,100,314 (or just over three-fifths), were British vessels. :--break of war.

ENEMY MINES.The week under review has been remarkably quiet, the enemy&apos;s minelaying work Minelaying. having been temporarily suspended.   Such suspension has on previous occasions been -followed by the use of a new type of mine.   The mines swept up during the week belonged to groups previously recorded.tThe following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British Vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.

No convoyed vessels have been lost during the week.To the end of December, 1917, 26,404 vessels in all have been convoyed (exclusive of Mediterranean Local Convoys), the total losses in convoy amounting to 147 vessels, or .55 per cent.Thirty-three additional Merchant Vessels have been fitted to take primary Armament, J)efensive and 42 to take supplementary Armament. armament.The number of Howitzers and Bomb-throwers delivered to date is 536.1,136 Merchant Vessels have now been fitted with Otter equipment. Mine pro-tection gear.MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.Nine enemy merchant, ships have this week arrived at, and 10 have sailed from, Merchant-Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat.   None have entered or left Rotterdam, and only mea&apos; four are reported as having left Delfzyl with enemy coal during the week.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Portugal.The recent abortive mutiny in the Navy, of which the Government evidently had ample warning, never appeared to be very serious, and its organisers obviously had no settled plan of campaign.Russia.The negotiations between the German and Russian Naval officers on the armistice conditions in the Arctic have not yet been resumed.It is reported that only about 40 per cent, of sailors remain in the ships of the Baltic Fleet. .There is no news of the situation in the Black Sea Fleet since the report of a mutiny received oh 1st January, in which 60 officers, including 4 admirals, are stated to have been murdered.
Japan.The state of affairs in Eastern Siberia causes much apprehension in Japan, as it is realised that one of the first manifestations of a German-controlled Russia would be German Submarines in the Sea of Japan.A British Cruiser, an American Cruiser (&quot; Brooklyn &quot;) and two Japanese Battle-ships are all proceeding to Vladivostok, where the Japanese will arrive first. The order of seniority will be : U.S.A. (assuming that Admiral Knight continues to fly his flag in &quot; Brooklyn &quot;) Japan Great Britain.Naval Staff,nth January, 1918.[Appendices.
