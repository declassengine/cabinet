Seekly Report on Poland.   XXIII-(11th January, 1918.)The formation of the Polish Government was followed by con-flicte with the German and Austrian officials who are naturally unwilling to part with their power even within the sphere which has already been conceded to the Poles.    MoreOTer the question of the interned revolutionaries and of Pilsudski*s imprisonment continues to embitter Polish opinion.     The Regency Council and the Polish Government are at one with the public, but all alike are helpless; the decision rests with the Germans, and the Poles have practically no means of extorting concessions from them. About the middle of December the conflict over the position of the Legionaries was assuming an acute form, when all questions of merely temporary importance were relegated to the background&apos;x by the opening of peace negotiations at Brest.Some time about December 20   the Polish Government-,addressed a request to the Central Powers for the admission of Polish representatives to the peace negotiations.     In that connection, the Polish Premier, M. de Kucharzewski, went to Berlin and sub-sequently also to Vienna.     After conversations with the German Chancellor, Herr von Mhlmann, Baron von dem Bussche and Count Czemin, it was settled that the Polish delegates were to assist the representatives of the Central Powers, but it seems only in an advisory character.     During his stay in Vienna Kucharzewski was received also by the Bmparor Charles and conferred with the Polish members of the Vienna Parliament.About the same time, when the Polish Government addressedIntelligence Bureau.Department of IxdformsJLijytit
its request for the admission of Polish representatives to the peace negotiations, conferences of all Polish political parties with the exception of the Socialists were started at Warsaw with a view to gising joint support to the Government during peace negotiations.     Imperialist claims to Lithuanian, White Russian and Little Russian territories are foreshadowed as the common programme of the Polish bourgeois parties.     Of these only the claims against Vhite Russia have now any chance of success.    With regard to the Lithuanians Germany has got her own policy, whilst the Ukraine has by now risen to such importance that the Central Powers will hardly choose to estrange her for the sake of Polish Imperialism.    Even the idea of handing over East Galicia to the Poles seems by now to have been abandoned.The position of the Polish delegates at Brest will be anyhow very peculiar.    The Bolsheviks demand the immediate evacuation of the occupied territories and an honest plebiscite within them. If this proposal is put to the Polish bourgeois politicians they will not dare either to accept or to reject it*    The Bolshevik demand is a clear and clean assertion of the Polish national rights, and yet none of the Polish bourgeois parties, be they National Democrats, Realists or adherents of the late Council of State could calmly envisage such an eventuality.    An honest plebiscite in the Lithuanian, white Russian or Ukrainian territories would put an end to Polish imperialistic claims, and long before the plebiscite could be taken the withdrawal of German and Austrian troops would have put an end to the Polish gentry and nobility, practically the only important Polish element within these territories.    In the Ukraine the Rada has already con-fiscated all big landed estates (very largely Polish),and  the jaqquerie is in full swing.    But also in Poland itself the withdrawal of Austrian and German troops, coupled with the return of the Pclish soldiers, peasants and workmen from Russia would
no doubt be the signal for a Polish Socialist revolution.     The poles are playing a remarkable part in the Russian Bolshevik movement.     One of the most active units fighting on the side of the Bolsheviks against the Cossacks, which has been frequently mentioned in their bulletins, is the First Regiment of the Polish Fusiliers; this regiment has grown up out of the pro-Russian Polish Legion organised in 1914 by the $rational Democrats.     Also among the leaders of the Bolsheviks the Poles are prominent. Thus e.g. Kozlowski and Orlowski (at Stockholm) are Roman Catholic Poles, Radek a Polish Jew.     Even now, whilst the German armies are still in occupation of Poland and the &quot;trained&quot; Polish Bolsheviks are as yet on the other side of the front, agrarian unrest seems to be rising in Poland.     If the Bolshevik demand for immediate evacuation of the occupied territories were to be carried out, these would probably within a few weeks be in full revolution.This is one more reason why the Germans can never agree to Trotski&apos;s terms.     In a leading article in the ffremdenblatt of December 11 Count Andrassy hints at the common interest which is growing up between the Central Powers and the Polish propertied classes - and the point is obvious.     The Polish gentry and bourgeoisie require the help of the Central Powers to ban the spectre of a Polish social revolution.     The Central Powers require Poland as an insulator against the revolutionary movement from the east.   . Y/ere the Revolution to reach the coalfield of Dombrova and Tchenstochova, how long would Upper Silesia or Saxony remain at peace?     If the peasants round Kalisz   and Wloclawek rose up in revolt, how long would Ost-Blbien continue in obedience to the Junkers?The outbreak of the Russian Revolution has fundamentally altered the elements of Polish politics. We have repeatedly pointed to its effects in our reports^    ITow the development is
reaching its logical conclusion.    At such a time there are but two dominant interests, the oonserrativeaad the revolutionary, and each of them must sooner or later join hands with its oom-panioner outside.     Only under the wings of the Central Powers (provided of course that in these the counter-revolutionary elements retain the upper hand) will the Polish propertied classes find safety.    The greatest potential anti-German force in Poland and throughout the occupied provinces in the east is on the other hand the peasants and workmen, who gnash their teeth at the thought that they cannot hit their jsaetera- -over the.head becuase German militarism guards them.11.1*18*
