The extent to which the newspapers and the general public are affected appears from the following figures which have been given to me by Sir George Riddell on behalf of the Newspaper Proprietors1 Association:Estimated imports of paper &amp; paper-makingmaterials for the year ending Feb. tons28 1918...................................550,000which would be reduced by one-third leaving ....367,000Absolute priority for the Govt. of .............100,000leaving .........267,000Required in addition by the Government afurther.................................... 80,000Balance available for newspapers andthe general public..............u 187,000I am very much concerned at the large quantities of paper used by Government Departments:   I am told that several Depart-ments are publishing small newspapers.     I believe there are many publications circulated broadcast among Government officials the utility of which to any but those officials immediately concerned is very questionable; that the number of copies of documents circulated by Government Departments could be drastic-ally cut down without any real detriment, and that there is a great waste of paper in much of the material issued to Members of both Houses of Parliament,     It has also been suggested to me that if Government Reports and papers were printed in a type half the size commonly used, very nearly half the paper used for this purpose would be saved.   No doubt other economies of a similar character could be effected, if serious attention were paid to the matter.I am convinced that, if the newspapers are to be severely rationed, it is essential to be able to say that Government departments are economical in the use of paper.I recommend that a small Committee be appointed under an independent Chairman to examine the amount of peg? er required
for the various Government Departments, and the use to which it is put, arid that the Committee &quot;be further empowered to enquire into the possibility of establishing a system of priority in supplying the paper required by Government Departments for different-purposes.The Department of Information which is concerned with issuing propaganda publications for foreign countries is already conferring with the Newspaper Proprietors1 Assoc-iation, but this Department of course stands on a different footing to other Government Departments, since its business is essentially to issue publications, and a large consump-tion of paper cannot be avoided.     But % question of policy will arise as to how far supplies to newspapers at home and supplies for propaganda should be respectively reduced.I consider that the matter is a very urgent one, and that the Committee should bo set up at the earliest possible moment.Edward Oarson.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W, January.11th, 1919.
