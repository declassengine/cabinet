Colonel toes*SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.*yO  bitC. 15.31^MEMORANDUM ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE CAUCASUS,(16 January, 1918.)General Situation.Following the examples set by the Ukraine, Siberia and the South-Eastern Union or Kuban, Trans-Cauoasia has established acharge of affairs until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly. On November 7/20 the Executive Council of the Soldiers1 and Workers&apos; Deputies in Tiflis, which is Menshevik or Moderate Socialist in outlook, assisted by the Nationalist party leaders, formed Itself into a Committee of Public Safety with a view to saving the country from conditions similar to those which marked the Bolshevist access to power in Petrograd and Moscow.   To further the cause of Trans-Caucasia and the defence of the front, a further meeting of representatives of every political and nationalist party and industrial union took place on November 11/24 in order to recognise a central authority in Trans-Caucasia.   At this meeting the following resolutions were passed:(1) Until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly, to entrust the defence of Trans-Caucasia and the front to the Committee of Public Safety, consisting of representatives of the revolutionary democracy, public bodies and nationalities.(2) To settle problems of a local character alone.(3) To base their authority on the Soviets, cn QkC^^JJ^vous and public representative bodies.Two days later the three Special Commissioners for Trans-Caucasia were Invited to join this Government, of which Mr Gueguetchkori was elected President and Mr TchekhengeliRepublic and a Central Executive Committee to take over the
Commissioner for Home Affairs.   It has been chosen on a proportionate national basis from representatives of the proletariat and bourgeois parties.     Against all this procedure the Bolsheviks entered a protest.Information received at the beginning of the month referred to the gradual spread of anarchy throughout Trans-Caucasia, corresponding with an extension of Bolshevism.     The general situation had become alarming in the Southern Caucasus, and Turkish Kurds, Persian bandits, Moslem troops and Russian soldiers returning from the front were causing widespread destruction and loss of life.     We are not in a position to give the quite latest news;   but the situation is hardly likely to have Improved, whilst Turkish emissaries are stirring up the country and recommending a further massacre of Armenians.The results of some recent elections to different Councils of Workers&apos; and Soldiers1 Deputies show a decrease in the Henshevik or Moderate Socialist vote and an increase in favour of the Nationalist and Bolshevik parties.   Naturally, the latter are particularly resentful against the smaller nationalities making use of the Revolution to develop their particular national ideals. Particularly symptomatic in this respect are the results of the municipal elections in Baku.   The Socialist bloc obtained 25 places; Bashnaktsutiun (Armenian) came next with 17, closely followed by the Bolsheviks with 16;   thereafter came the Musavet party (14 places) and the Mussulman United Bloc (11 places);   the Cadets have only 6 places.   It should be noted that the two Mussulman blocs together polled a thousand more votes than the Socialists. Further   evidence of the intensity of national feeling may be gathered from the circumstance than when Bolshevik individuals of the demobilised Russian Tsaritsin Regiment began looting and
plundering in the town of Kutais they were promptly rounded up by Georgian soldiers, put into a train and sent out of Gecrgia.Allied Relations with the Caucasus.The following extract from Sakhartvelo, the leading Georgian newspaper, under date of October 25 (which has only recently come to hand), may be taken as representative of Georgian feeling.&quot;We are in possession of reliable information that the Baku Tatars are in constant communication with the Young Turks in Constantinople and are getting ready for the time when they can render assistance to the advancing Turks end the Germans.&quot;The Western Allies, Prance and England, are doing nothing at all to assist us beyond negotiating with some adventurous Armenians.   In this we are placing them in the position of representatives of the Caucasus.     Such an attitude on the part of England and France constitutes an Insult towards the Georgians and Tatars and is going to produce most deplorable efforts for the Armenians and themselves.   The Western Allies have always been late in assisting small nations;   we are sure they will be late also in our case, thus enabling Germany to enter into our country, where we have no ammunition and nothing with which to defend ourselves.    England and Prance have looked for decision to Petrograd, and for that reason endangered their own position and ours as well&quot;.The above is written from a keenly Nationalist point of view and has, therefore, to be discounted to a considerable extentj but it indicates elements in the situationwhich may be easily overlooked with unfortunate results.   The present Caucasian Central Government is international in outlook and worthy of all support, but it is not easy to suppose that the animosities and suspicions of centuries can be eradicated in the course of nine
months, and the cohesion of the Government may not be very great. On the other hand, each of the   three principal nationalities, Georgian, Armenian and Tatar, has its own National Council      which, with minor exceptional elements, they will at once fall back on the indication of any serious local trouble.   These National Councils at this stage therefore represent a more permanent element, and the Realpolitik of the Caucasus hinges upon them.    They cannot be ignored in view of possible eventualities.     The general tendency in Trans-Caucasia since the Revolution has been for the nationalities to increase in strength and to improve their organisation, while Non-National, All-Russian and Bolshevik organisations have not made a corresponding progress.If this is the case, however, it must be remembered that the Georgian and Armenian nationalities are on about equal terms, and in the event of the Allies entering into relations with them, preference for one or approaching one through the other, or indirectly, wsuld infallibly arouse the jealousy of the other, and lead to trouble.    It happens that, owing to their tragic history, the Armenian people has been brought into more direct contact with the European Powers than the Georgians, and they also have several very able, outstanding personalities both locally and abroad to represent their interests.    On the other hand, while the Georgians fail in this respect, they are much the more numerous people/ and; particularly since the Revolution, have made much more rapid strides than the Armenians in the consolidation of their national interests.   Further, in the years immediately preceding the war they had been gradually drawing level with the Armenians both in business enterprise and in political control, especially in Tiflisj   and they would probably be able to provide fighting forces on as great a scale as the Armenians if approached directly.    The
Georgians are gentlemen and good fighters, and are prepared to fight not merely in defence of Georgia, but against the possibility of Turco-German domination in Asia Minor.   They are prepared to fight for the existence of an autononous (late Turkish) Armenia, as, if they did not, it means that there would be further Armenian pressure on their own territory.   They are also prepared to fight in defence of the Trebizond vilayet in particular, and the country of the Lazis, who are Mohammadan Georgians.In order to keep a strong hinterland it is necessary that the nationalities should remain in harmony with each other and loyal to the central Government, which is largely composed of members of these different National Councils.   This, however, will not be easy, since their interests are conflicting, especially in the case od Armenians and Tatars, vhile the religion of the latter makes fchem definitely hostile to the Allies.   Turco-German propaganda has been at work   among Tatars and Georgians trying to make them fall out with the Armenians, and the conciliatory spirit which existed among them all at the beginning of the Revolution is, at the moment, on the wane.   The circumstance that the Tatars, who were not subject to conscription under the old regime, have also started to form an army under the leadership of their own Council at Baku is a serious factor in the situation, considering that the Tatar nationalities are anti-Armenians and pro-Turk.   All this means that the Georgians hold the key to the situation, inasmuch as disregard of them would drive them into neutrality.   This would imply the loss of a definite amount of hold on the Tatars and the certainty of renewed massacres of the Armenians by the latter.   Newspaper reports of trenches more or less thinly manned by the Turks may be a feint to cover an advance on Tiflis later in the spring.
. Georgian National Interests.These are being continmlly urged with very marked insistence. The Georgian demands are for tho observance of the ancient treaties with Russia, guaranteeing her (1) her own elected Government, (2) expedition of her own business affairs,   (3) Courts of Justice and the-use of the Georgian language for educational purposes as being the speech of the peasantry and industrialists, and (4) autocephaly of the Church and maintenance ^f a national army, (5) inviolability and indivisibility of treaty boundaries. The determination is expressed to defend these rights not merely before the Constituent Assembly, but at the Peace Conference. The present Georgian point of view may perhaps be given typically in a few sentences from the speech of Mr Chenkeli, Minister of the Interior In the present jL^iCtftBian^^v^nmen-tt before the Petrograd Preliminary Parliament in the end of September:tt... Russians do not seem to have any national self-consciousness at allf. and I am ashamed, as the representative of a small nation, to have to teach you a lessxm in that respect. ..... So far as theattitude of the Bolsheviks is concerned, I consider it absolutely ruiaous for Russia, as she is herself totally devoid of national self-consciousness. ....   Let us, on the other hand, beware of toomuch nationalism, as this is going to lead to our domination by Germany, in which case we shall be cursed by the organised democracy of the Western Allies.      We Georgians will patiently wait until the Russians recover their self-consciousnessj   should we be disappointed there is nothing left to us but to look after ourselves and defend our independent political existence&quot;.The consciousness of the national strength may be further judged by the calmness wHth which the Georgian press is regarding the Tatar endeavours from Baku to isolate the Georgian Hussulmans,
in particular the Adjartsi, and this in spite sf the fact that the latter revolted in 1914.     A Conference of Georgian Mussulmans was held in the town of Akhaltsikh at the end of October. The general feeling seems to have been that religion and nationality-ought not to be presented as two mutually exclusive elements, and that good Mussulmans could also be good Georgians.     The Christian Georgians have no fear of the movement, particularly in view of the general drawing together of Georgians and Tatars as against the Armenians in connection with the introduction of Zemstvos and other contentious matters.The Georgian nobility, having decided to acquiesce in the abolition of titles and ranks as proclaimed throughout Russia, have been faced with the question of the disposition of certain : lands and property amassed by the nobility as a class.     It has been decided voluntarily to surrender these in the educational interests of the Georgian people as a whole, a decision which is quite in accordance with the generous instincts of the Georgian race.   A special governing body composed of representatives of the towns, Zemstvos, educational institutions and political parties is to be formed to hold the property temporarily until the Georgian Representative Assembly can make some permanent decision.Introduction of the Zemstvo.The Armenian Dashnaktsutiun party have taken up the attitude that there must be no introduction of Zemstvos without a previous change of administrative boundaries in certain cases.   Their reasons for adopting this attitude may be summarised as follows:The last administrative changes of boundaries were made in the late sixties more in the interests of the bureaucratic desire to
break up the Armenian majority in certain provinces than on any sound economic or ethnographical lines.   The 1,700,000 Armenians of Trans-Caucasia are found for the most part in the Governments of Erivan, Elizabetpol and Tiflis, and partly in Baku and the districts of Kars.     In the 19 districts inhabited by Armenians, the latter form a majority in only 6, their minerity in the other 13 being due to the unnatural distribution of the boundaries.While the Armenian suggestions for readjustment are quite reasonable in general, they are open to serious criticism in some respects.   The most widely accepted Armenian proposal would give 15 Armenian districts where   60% of the population is Armenian, but where, by their scheme of distribution, they have arranged to seoure a majority for themselves in 10 of these districts.   They also make claims on the southern areas of the Government of Tiflis, to which the Georgians will never consent.The result of these claims is seen in the formation of a Georgian Mussulman bloc against the Armenians whenever the matter has come up for public discussion.    The whole question was referred to the Provisional Government last summer, which decided to introduce the Zemstvo at once in those provinces and districts about which there was no dispute and to postpone the introduction elsewhere until after the meeting of the Constituent Assembly, when an attempt was to be made to bring about agreement between the contending parties.   This decision was considered at a Conference of the different Caucasian parties held under the presidency of Chenkeli at the end of October.   The Georgians and Tatars supported each other and carried a resolution introducing the Zemstvo in Georgian and Tatar areas without redistribution and postponing the settlement of those areas which were under dispute.        The Dashnaktsutiun representatives left the meeting In protest.
Administrative Problems.There have been signed articles in the Kavkazhoe Slovo and Vozrojdenie drawing attention to the chaotic administrative conditions still prevalent in Turkish Armenia, in spite of the expenditure of 10 million roubles subsequent to the great loss of Rus sian lives in conquering the country.   The type of Official enlisted by General Pyeshkoff in the autumn of 1916 was totally unsuitable.   Many of the old &quot;administrative orders&quot; have remained in force.     The police were certainly changed and the Governor-Generalship was converted into a General Commissaryship, but the administrative organisation brought into being by the General Commissary has done comparatively little to relieve the distress, and left the vital issue of practical aid to local charitable societies.   Wandering Armenian refugees have been attacking Tatar homesteads in desperation, Tatars have retaliated en Armenians, and further trouble has developed from the steps taken to put matters right.     It is urged in the articles in question that even yet the &quot;old regime&quot; plan of setting nationality against nationalist is followed;   that c ompetent administration must be introduced at once, the whole administrative body reorganised and broad democratic elements of citizenship introduced.It may be noted that the Dashnaktsutlun party passed the follow ing resolution, amongst others, at their last meeting in Tiflis with regard to Turkish Armenia:&quot;Starting from the general position that the Turkish Armenian question has been an international one from the beginning, and that the independence and separate administration of the conquered provinces are secured by the enactments of the Hague Convention and that this situation is further acknowledged by a declaration of the Russian Democracy on April 14, 1917, and of the Provisional Government on July 8,. this session of
16.1.18ftashnakt&amp;utiun acknowledges the absolutely essential separation of the Commissaryship of Turkish Armenia and its direct relationship with the Central Government, and will determinedly oppose the proposal made in different Caucasian circles of an administrative union of Turkish Armenia with the Caucasus proper&quot;.
