REPORTED DISLOYALTY OF CANADIAN TROOPS.

London, S.W.

8th January, 1918.

Dear Lord Derby,

In reply to yours of yesterday I may say that, after writing you on December 7th, I wrote Sir Edward Carson asking him to be good enough to let me have some details or particulars which would enable us to locate the trouble. He replied on December 19th saving that he had made further enquiries but had not obtained anything more to add to the rather vague statement which was made to his Parliamentary Secretary by a lady at Shoreham who, on being communicated with, said she was unable to give any information for official use. I went into the question with Sir Richard Turner who tells me that, as far as he knows, this rumour is unfounded. We no longer have any troops at Shoreham and it seems hardly fair to our men that such a vague rumour should have been circulated by anyone there.

If you hear anything more definite on the subject I am sure the Military authorities will be glad to investigate it fully and in that case I would suggest your taking it up with Sir Edward Kemp for the purpose.

Yours sincerely,

(Signed). George H. Perley.

The Right Honourable

The Earl of Derby., K.G. 

War Office, S.W.1.
