(Tfo t s Doc ii m e nf of893323Intelligence Bureau,Secret.Department of Information. fIW/024.mWZZ   REPORT   OH,. ITALY, XXIV,(Jan 11th, 1918)The Orlando Ministry, its hands strengthened by Conference with the Allies and by the defeat and partial exposure of the Giolittian-Socialist conspiracy which was the most significant result of the recent Session, haB, it is satisfactory to be able to report, pcff-ceeded without delay t6 vigorous action.The thorough-going elimination of enemy subjedts so long clamoured for by the Interventionist Press and urged upon the Government by the representatives of the Allies has at last foeen undertaken.   The process of rounding up be&amp;an with the New Year and is still proceed-ing but already we hear of 1800 persons being interned in the pro-vinces of the extreme South and of 300 expelled from the country. Active measures are also being taken for the sequestration of proper-ties and businesses      It appears that the Bollati-von Jagotfagree-ment for reciprocal protection of German and Italian subjects resi-dent respectively in Italy and Germany, which was supposed to bind the hands of the Italian Government, was annulled some weeks before Italy&apos;s declaration of war on Germany. &apos;A further proof of the Governments determination to act with energy is the oreation, announced on Jan.1st of a War Cabinet, con-sifting of the President of Council, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Treasury, War, Marine, Arms &amp; Munitions and the Minister of Pensions, Signor Bissolati;   whose addition to the Council is regarded as a guarantee for the thorough prosecution of the war.A re-examination has beon ordered of the rejected recruits of the 1874-1899 classes (10-43 years of age)
In the important question of ?ood Control progress is also beingmade.     Rationing for sugar; cereal foods, butter and lately coalis being or has recently been introduced all over Italy, each cityor commune having its own system devised to suit its particularconditions.     Complaints of faulty working and bungling are ft^quent,but at any rate an effort is being made and exoerience gained.   Acensus of grain stocks has been ordered by the Commissary Generalwith a view to putting a stop to hoarding and a stirring and useful issuedcircular/to the provincial and municipal authorities pointing out to all citizens the duty imposed upon them by the situation and the best means of increasing production and diminshing consumption. The right of forbidding export of food-stuffs from one province to another, which had been too rigorously applied and had pro-duced unnecessary inequalities has been withdrawn from the Prefects and reserved to the Minister of the Interior.Telegrams to British journals show that the Lesgue of National Defence organised during the recent Session in opposition to the neutralist movement in the Chamber and Senate, has grown in num.. bers and influence and is undertaking a vigorous campaign in the country.     A great patriotic demonstration at Milan is being, arran-ged for Jan. 20th.     The demonstration      in honour of the 411ies, and in particular of the successful recovery by French troops *f the heights of M. Tomba on Dec. 31st, which took place in Rome on Jan. 3rd has been reported in the English press.  .veryMr. Lloyd George1s speech on War-aims has been/favourably received in Italy.   The Vatican organ, L&apos;Osservatore Romano, (according to a Times telegram) Says that Mr. Lloyg George&apos;s speech may be the beginning of the end since now it is officially known what Great Britain wants.     It reduces the aims of the Entente to certain points which admit of discussion by the enemy, and it now behoves the Central Powers to reply.
Another Vatican paper, the Corriere d&apos;Italia is even more enthuaiastic in its praises of the speech in which it finds the same spirit as inspired the Papal Note. Certain papers (Giornale d&apos;Italia, Messaggero, and L&apos;Idea Nazionale) while welcoming the speech as a whole find the reference to Italian aims inadequate. Mere recovery of the terre irredenta is not enough. Italy&apos;s position in the Adriatic must be secured.
