Memorandum by the President of the Board ,of Trade.The attention of the Board of Trade has been drawn, bothby the Ministry of Munitions, to the desirability of theco-ordination of various forms of horse and mechanical roadtransport so that more effective use can be. made of them.t7/0 meetings of representatives of the Departmentsconcerned have been held at the Ministry of Munitions.At the first of these meetings the view was generally expressedthat the Board of Trade was the Department that should becharged with the supervision of this matter, and I am prepared,should my colleagues so agree, to accept this view.    At thesecond of these meetings a suggested scheme prepared by theBoard of Trade and agreed to by the Ministry of Food was dis-cussed, with certain amendments suggested by the Ministry ofMunitions, and a scheme based on these suggestions met withgeneral acceptance.The principal ideas are as followsInat there should be set up a Road Transport Boardconsisting of representatives of each of the followingdepartments:Board of Trade (Petrol Control Dept.) Board of Trade (Horse Transport Dept.) Ministry of Munitions Ministry of Pood War Office Post Office.Of these Departments the Vfar Office was not represented at the meetings but it is understood that they would be willing to appoint a representative on the Board.      A number of other departments would be asked to nominate representatives to receive copies of the Agenda of the Board end extracts from the Minutes; the Representative of any one of these De-partments to be summoned to attend whenever a question affect-ing that particular Department arises: .
The terms of reference^to the Board would be:-&quot;To co-ordinate the work of the existing-Gorerrziment Departments in connection with road transport; to determine -what further measures are necessary to ensure the most economic use of road transport vehicles and their efficientmmallocation for meeting such requirements as may arise from time to time for the transport of food, munitions and other war material, and for the essential needs of the trade and industry of the Country; and subject to the direction of the Board of Trade, to give executive effect thereto,&quot;The Road Transport Board when constituted would take into consideration jjatsr alia the following proposals:-(a) The registration of vehicles, whether driven bypetrol, steam, gas, or electricity, or horse-arawn, insucn a way that any of them could be rapidly called upon in any district should emergency arise.(b) The preparation of a priority scheme for the useof such vehicles in emergency.(c) The preparation and putting into force of localscheme for co-ordination and economy in the use of horse and mechanical transport by traders, Government Departments and otters, whether by voluntary action or, if necessary, by compulsion, having regard to the necessity of not unduly interfering with any essential trade or industry.(d) Tlie regulation of rates cf hire for horses andvehicles (so far as not already regulated by any Public Authority).Horses and vehicles used mainly or entirely for agriculturalpurposes are excluded from (c) and (d) above.It is further proposed that the Board should exerciseits executive functions through Divisional Road TransportBoards set up in each of the 15 Divisional Arees of thePood Commissioners consisting in each case ofA Road Transport Officer(appointed by the Board of Trade). The Divisional Food Commissioner of the Ministry ofFood or his representative, The Local Transport Officer of the Ministry of Munitions-or hie representative, with Two representatives of local interests.The Chairman being the Road Transport Officer.
Sub-Committees would be appointed by the Divisional Boards to deal with sub-areas of their  Divisions.(E) The necessary powers of control are to some, extent possessed by the Board of Trade through the control of Petrol and of Horses and horse-drawn vehicles, but certain additional po?/ers would be necessary and steps would be taken to acquire them by an Amendment of the Defence of the Realm Regulations,(F) General instructions for the guidance of the Divisional Road Transport Boards would be drawn up by the Central Board and a general idea of the procedure of the Divisional Boards was drawn up at the second meeting at the Ministry of Munitions, to which I have referred.Unless my colleagues disagree with these proposals, I propose to take the necessary steps forthwith to set up a Road Transport Board as circumstances may arise which may necessitate the putting into force of schemes such as those fore-shadowed in paragraph (C).a. h. stanley.Board of Trade,18th January, 1918,
