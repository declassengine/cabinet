His Britannic *V1aje.rty&apos;s Government.)(This Document is the Property ofSECRyx&quot;.Intelligence Bureau, %Department of Information. CKW/036.WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   RUSSIA, XXXVI,(18 January, 1918).The Bolsheviks and the Peace Jegotiajbions.The latest reports show that there is another hitch in thepeace negotiations at Breat Litovsk and that the Bolsheviks end the Germans are no nearer an understanding on the questions of Poland, Courland and Lithuania.   Meanwhile the centre of interest is transferred to Berlin and Petrograd, where the effects of Brest Litovsk will he felt most acutely.Whether Trotski has been worsted or not by his opponents in the battle of dialectics at Brest, he has stood steadily fcy his principles and has not yielded to any of the German arguments in favour of a German solution of the question of &quot;no annexations&quot;, It Is probable that the negotiations have shown Trotski how impossible It is to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the questions of Eastern Europe by way of a separate peace.    One obvious example of this is the question of the demobilisation of the Russian and German armies.   The Russians naturally demand that the Germans shall demobilise at the same time as they do, but it is clear that so long as the war continues in the West the Germans can do nothing which might impair the efficiency of their armies. The difficulties of a separate peace have probably been obvious to Trotski from the beginning, and it may perhaps be argued that he has not made any very great efforts to secure it.   According to private reports which we quote with all reserve, Trotski himself expected the temporary victory of the German militarists as theresult of the negotiations.   If so, it would appear that the main
g idobject of Brest from the Bolshevik point of view was to stir up political trouble in Germany.   If we are to accept au pied de la lettre the statements issued by the Bolsheviks about revolution in Germany they are childishly optimistic, but it is diffioult to believe that they are such bad judges of events in Germany ae at first sight appears.    Through Stockholm they have been in touch with German Socialists for many months past, and Radek, Trotski&apos;s principal adviser on German affairs, has a thorough knowledge of German politics.    It is more likely that they are able to judge pretty accurately the real state of affairs in Germany, though their own idealism may sometimes lead them astray, and that their public statements about Germany are issued with an eye to their own position in Russia.   After all, the latter consideration is the most Important to them, aid every step they take must be guided by the state 6f feeling in Petrograd and elsewhere.Supposing, therefore, that Trotski is not anxious to hurry through a separate peace, aid that the main object of Brest is to cause a ferment in all the belligerent countries, how is his failure to secure peace going to affect his own position in Russia?    Or who could replace the Bolsheviks if they were new driven fam power?There is no doubt that the bulk of the Russian army desires peace at almost any price, and it is also true that any political party that could gain the support of the army could snatch the reins of Government out of the hands of the Bolsheviks.   But what party is there to gain the support of the army md how are they to make themselves its spokesmen?   These are questions which the Bolsheviks have undoubtedly faced and answered to their own satisfaction. We ourselves have loo little information about the present state of the army to form any opinion on the question of its allegiance to the Bolsheviks, but from various notices in the press it appears that
the Bolsheviks are trying to reorganise the army so as to make it a force upon *hich they can rely.   Ostensibly this is being done to meet a German attack, but in winter such fin attack is not likely, and it is more probable that the first thoughts of the Bolsheviks are for the home front.   They are perhaps trying to form a nuoleus in the army which will be sufficiently well-organised and reliable to oppose any efforts of rival political parties to use the army fox their own ends;   but in the hopeless chads into which the army has been allowed to fall it does not seem certain that they will be able to accomplish even that much.Guaranteed that the army does not desert them, the next factor which the Bolsheviks will have to deal with is the Constituent Assembly,   This body is to meet on January 18 after having been bullied and held up for more than a month.  Whether it is going to prove a formidable opponent or not, it as as yet impossible to say. The Social Revolutionaries have a large majority - 267 to 161 -over the Bolsheviks, but the Social Revolutionaries are not a united party.   They are now divided into at least three groups (1) Right, led by Avksentyev, Kerenski etc.   (2) Centre, led by Chernov.   (5) Left, led by Maria Spiridonova.   Of these groups only the Left will join the Bolsheviks, but as most of the leaders of the Right are either in prison or in hiding, it is probably only the Centre that will really count as regards opposition to the Bolsheviks.   Now the Centre party is singularly devoid of \ forcible political leadersj   Chernov has already been tried and found wanting, and an opposition led by him, even if successful for a time, could never cope with the present Situation for long. Without leaders, therefore, the Social Revolutionaries may not put up much of a fight when the Constituent Assembly meets.   If they do the Bolsheviks will resort to force and will certainly not hesitate to dissolve the Constituent Assembly;   if they do not the
18.1.18.Bolsheviks will force the Constituent Assembly to ratify their legislation and they will then reign supreme.    The chances are, therefore, that the Bolsheviks will continue in power and will weather this   crisis.Supposing, however, the unexpected happens, and the Bolsheviks are overthrown.   This cannot happen without a severe struggle which would still further aggravate the prevailing anarchy.    And even after the struggle was over the political situation would, if anything, be worse rather than better.   It is unreasonable to imagine that a Social Revolutionary Government which succeeded the Bolsheviks could simply dismiss the Sovyets;   yet as long as the Sovyets continue in opposition they can make any strong Government impossible.   We should probably witness a repetition of the last weeks of the Kerenski regime, viz. a weak Government and an active opposition in the Sovyete.   The result would be another Revolution and the return of the Bolsheviks.It is from considerations such as these that we venture to think the Bolsheviks are not so very greatly alarmed about their own position in Petrograd.   For   the present they seem to show that they have more backbone than any other political party, and so long as discontent is rife, it is only a party with backbone that can make any attempt at governing the country.
