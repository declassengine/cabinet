5 DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY5 S GOVERNMENT .)WAR CABINET. LIQUOR RESTRICTION AND CONTROL.Memorandum by Major Waldorf Aster, &apos;(.ff.Letters, resolutions and miscellaneous communications in favour of the rationing of drink are being received.   The word &quot;rationing&quot; is U3ed in vague and widely differing meanings; but the demand for something of the kind is likely to increase especially if a system of rationing bread by ticket is set up.Drink ( and particularly beer) rationing is being demanded on the broad principle that both bread and beer U30 grain and the drinking man is not entitled, as against the non-drinking man, to have a two-fold ration of cereal, i,e., in bread and in beer.Drink rationing, like bread rationing, must be complicated and troublesome, and is certainly undesirable if it can be avoided.   With all its disadvantages, however, it may be necessary in order to meet the difficulties enumerated.   It may not be feasible; but it should be carefully examined before being rejec-ted.   A prima facie! case for its possibility can be made on the following lines:-The manufacture of beer, stout and spirits, necessitates the withdrawing from human consumption of a known amount of grain, etcIf bread rationing (more or less on the present scale for bread and cereals) is adopted,  each person will presumably receive a ticket entitling him to a definite amount of cereals. This ticket might be so drawn as to show that a proportion of the cereals allowed for the holder might be taken out in drink Instead of bread.   Safeguards would have to be devised against a man under-feeding himself by drinking instead of eating bread. The rationing might take several forms, all involving, undoubtedly, serious difficulties; but it might be possible (to take a simple example) to enable every man or woman to have the opportunity of settling the question of &quot;beer versus bread&quot; for himself, by deciding - within prescribed limits -whether to take bread or drink in the proportions,  say,  of 12 ozs. of bread to eight half-pints of mild beer or four half-pints of heavy stout or six or eight glasses of whiskey or ei:dit glasses of wine.If drink rationing by ticket were feasible, it might be expected to have the following advantages(l) The rationing of intoxicants on a scale which was related to the official graduated bread allowance, must lead to the better distribution of liquor, as men engaged in the heaviest kind of v;ork would be entitled to a bigger beer ration than sedentary workers. Much of the industrial unrest would be relieved if such a scheme   were feasible.SECRET. S.T. 3375.
(2)   It wight go far to meet tho resentment fiaong the-working classes which is &quot;based on tho feeling that tho &quot;brovers and Whiskey distillers are profiteering, This feeling is natural when it is realized that a pint of tho Government ale which is sold at tho Government price   of od. costs less than 3d, to produce and retail, and that a glass of whiskey which is made for about 2d. is sold at 8d. or more.It is not possible to deal with profiteering by merely requiring prices to be lowered. If the retail prices ware reduced sufficiently to stop excessive profits without a system of rationing being instituted simultaneously, other troubles would arise which night create more irritation t3ian exists already. In short, profiteering in liquor must be connived at or authorised by the Government unlcsf3 rationing is adopted.(3)   Drink rationing would give an impression of fairness all round and would meet the grievance now felt by men who work their full time and then find the Pullic Houses run out of liquor, because other men leave their work or their hone early, and so gi.t not only their glass, but someone else&apos;s as well.   The problem of the night worker who may never get a fair chance for a drink and who now has a real grievance, night also be dealt with. Drink queues, concerning which there have been frequent references in the Pr^ss,  could be reduced or abolished by drink rationing if feasible.(4)   It night still further reduce drunkenness and go some way to meet t\c desire frequently expressed in tho Dominions and America for greater protection for Canadian and American soldiers and sailors in this country,(5)   It might effect c saving in cereals and sugar,(6)   It might diminish the agitation as to total prohibition, both  or and against.(Signed)   W, ASTOR.18th January, 1918.
