(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government).3 C R B TA WAR     CABINET.RUSSIAN CREDIT AMD TREASURY BILLS. Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I have to take a decision which is open to attack and will fibably he attacked whatever course I adopt.   The facts are as follows:-   -After the late Chancellor of the Exchequer had completed his al arrangements with the Russian finance Minister in 1915, the latter ill required an advance for purposes of the exchange and declared that ssia could not      without it.   As the Treasury were not willing to advance ey for this purpose, it was suggested that Mr. Bark should take it up 5h the Governor gf the Bank gf England.   He did so and the Governor conven a meeting with the Clearing Banks which was addressed by Mr. Bark,   The opting Houses, the Scottish Banks, and&quot;a large number of the Colonial Is were approached by tho Governor in the same way. The result was that eptances to the amount of  7,500,000 were arranged. Bow it is contended, undoubtedly with truth, that this money was provided not in the ordin-way of business but to please the Government and as they thought, since Spvernor of the Bank&apos;of England- took an active part in it, at the spec-request of the Government.    It is contended, therefore, that the Govern-t should bear the liability. .On the other hand, the late Chancellor of Exchequer, inasmuch as he did not accept definite liability on the part Eis Majestyrs Government, drew a sharp distinction between an advance this kind and one for which the British Government was liable. It is not Qssible that if we da accent liability Mr. McZenna himself may take the &apos;! in the House of Commgns that we ought not to have done so, and for tous reasons I have not thought it right to consult him in the matter.-the other hand, if. we do not accept any responsibility the whole of the of London will consider that they have been very badly treated by the lament..  Credit as a whole will be affected and the institutions which ?ted the Bills out of. a feeling of patriotism.......................will
will undoubtedly raise an outcry which will have far-reaching effect and it will be specially dangerous inasmuch as so   many of the Colonial Banks ere affected. Legal proceedings will be taken by the acceptors against the Russian Banks which were the drawers of the Bills and the Banque de l1Etat which guaranteedthem,, and any assets of these institutions in this country will be attached.On the whole, therefore, while we have no legal liability I think we have a very strong moral responsibility, but on the other hand I do not think that the whole of whatever loss may eventually beincurred should fall upon the Government.   I propose, therefore, to make the best arrangement I can with the firms which have accepted these Bills, subject toavoiding an appearance of treating them meanly, and the arrangement which I propose will be something in the nature of giving them the option of having an advance from the Government and taking the full liability themselves or of handing their claims over entirely to the Government receiving in exchange ten or twelve year Exchequer Bonds at 3 per cent., which would mean that the Government bought their rights at about  80 for the  100.&apos; -    - 71- V-]&apos;- &apos;  &apos; )$- - r&quot;: &apos; &apos;    &apos; -&quot; .&apos; &apos; &apos;    &quot; &apos;   :&quot; &apos;, /    . &apos;. : -   -&apos;   \      :     * -      :. -.     : .        &apos;        ... . &quot;   &apos; .    -     . .   :      .. .     :     -  .   &apos; -yThere is also an omount of  10,000,000 RussianTreasury-Bills issued by the Bank &amp;f tnglund on behalfof the Russian Government in regard to which it was.... &apos;stated in the prospectuses when they were issued.thatthe issue was made with the approval of His Majesty&apos;1 sGovernment. I would propose to adopt the same course in dealing with these.   As, however, the action takenis very liable to attack I would like the approval of. the Cabinet before I take a decision.A.Bonar &quot;-Law.Treasury, 14th January, 1918.-
