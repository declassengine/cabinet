E.   Conclusions.
-    1   -On the assumption that there ere certain terms which it is essential for the Allies to obtain from Turkey as conditions of peace, there appears to be two conceivable ways in which these terms might &quot;be secured;Either (1) we might improve our military successes against Turkey to a point which would enable us to take all we wanted from her by force.For this, our military position towards the other members of the5enemy alliance would also have to be 4o favourable that we should not need to bargain away any of our Turkish assets in settling accounts with them.In this event, Turkey would doubtless be ready to treat for a spearate peace, but that would be of little, importance, since by implication a general peace through a military viotory of the Allies would already be in sight.On the other hand (E) if our military successes did not reachthis *)oint, we could only obtain from Turkey the terms indispensableto us by making concessions on our part, in matters not detrimentalto our war-aims, which, in conjunction with the military advantageswe possessed at the moment of negotiation, would induce her to makeinthe sacrifices demanded ut   exchange for peace.This case might arise either (a) if Turkey desired a separate peace in the expectation that her Allies coulo not secure her her own war-aims by a general victory, but before a military decision had been reached in the main theatre of war;    or (b)   if negotiations for a general peace were opened at a similar stage of the military operations.     In the latter case Germany would in effect be negotia-ting with us ton TurkeyTs behalf as well as her own, and it would then make a great difference whether our indispensable demands from Turkey necessitated a coercion of Turkey on Germany;&apos;s pait, equivalent &quot;&quot;to
-   -the sacrifice of an ally and a st/ain on Germany&apos;s honour, or whether they could be obtained with Turkey&apos;s consent.Prom this point of view it is worth examining Turkey&apos;s war-aims, her present gains and losses in respect of them, and our own war-aims with regard to Turkey. .   Turkey&apos;s War* aims.(!) Negative;   To remove the danger from Russia.The C.U.P. were genuinely afraid of the Tsardomfs designs on Constantinople and the Straits. Armenia, Alexandretta, and the whole northern half *t the Ottoman Empire;   and they believed that Russia had been given cafcte blanche by the old protectors of Turkey, England and France, as a move in their larger polioy of insurance against Germany.     The C.U.P. inferred Russia&apos;s designs from her traditional policy, from the part she played in the Balkan War,      . from her advocacy of the Armenian Reforms in 1913, from her intrigues with the Kurds, and from her encircle-ment of Turkey through Persia.     They inferred the reorientation of French, and still more of British,policy from the Persian Agreement of 1907, the complacence of both Powers towards Italy in the Tripoli War, and their diplomacy in the Balkan settlement of 1913.Positive :   Sto turn the Ottoman Empire into a Turkish national State and an independent power.Internally :   by preserving its territorial integrity, and within these frontiers abolishing the capitulations,establishing an autonomous customs tariff, enforcing the use of the Turkish language for all public or legal purposes, supplanting foreign educational institutions and crushing the non-Turkish nationalities of the Empire (Armenians, Greeks, Arabs, Jews).
j(b)    Earternelly:   by increasing^ if possible, the Empirefs prestige and territory^    With this object the 0.0.P. ex-ploited the feelings of the enormous Moslem populations under European rule, who looked up to Turkey as the only Hoslem State whioh had preserves its independence, and as the one possible liberator of those that had lost theirs.    The Sultan^ title te the Caliphate, the Holy War, and the Ban-Islamic and Pan-Turanian Movements, were mobilised by the C.u\P* to this end.Turkey1 s  resent Gains and Losses.(l)    The menace from Russia has vanished with the fall of the Tsardom.    One of the chief issues on Whioh Kerenaky took office in succession to the Cadets was the renunciation of Constantinopl and the Bolsheviks, in their wireless of 6.12.17 to &quot;All the labouring Class Moslems of Russia and the Orient&quot; declare that &quot;-the treaty concerning the partition of Turkey and the separa-tion of Armenia from her is torn in pfteoos and destroyed&quot;, though they add that &quot;when hostilities cease, the Armenians will have the right to decide upon their own political future.&quot;On the other hand, though the War has already relieved Turkey of any danger from the side of Russia, it has created a danger for her from Great Britain which did not exist before, which is increasing instead of diminishing as the War continues, and which she will have to allay if her war-aim of &quot;security&quot; is to be attained in the peace-settlement,(2) Apparent progress has been made towards the internal aman-eipation and Turcifioation of the Empire. The abolition of the Capitulations has been recognised by Turkey1 s Allies, a new cus-toms tariff has been introduced, Preach and English railwayconcessions have been nationalised^-dras^io language ordinance
mm     ^    mm^pAls been passed, the French and American sohools have been closed, the Armenians have been almost exterminated, and the same is being done with the Oreeks.    The political control of the C,u,P. is more absolute than before, and they are making their fortunes (at the expense of all classes, nationalities and religions impartially) by the government monopolies they have established over the necessities of life.On the other hand, the area of Turkish sovereignty has been out down by the loss of Armenia, Irak, the Hejaz and Ju-daea.    In the Occupied territories Turoifioation has been stopped dead, and the Zionist, Arab, and Armenian national movements are having free play.    The half of the Armenian nation which lives in Russia has survifled and obtained greater power of initiative sinoe the Russian Revolution.     The triumph of Yenizelos and the intervention of Greece on the side of the Allies have raised once more the Greek irredentist question in Anatolia.Again, within the trrritory still held by Turkey, the results of emancipation and Turoification are largely illusory. The destruction of the Armenians and Greeks has ruined Turkey as a whole economically, without benefiting the Turkish element. The abolition&quot; of the Capitulations and the new tariff cannot save Turkey from being boycotted economically by England, France and the United States, if they choose to do so after the war. The German railway concessions, which are much more important than the French and English, remain in non-Turkish hands.     The language ordinanoe was so impracticable that it was whittled down by the Senate and even so has remained virtually a dead letter.    The French and American missionaries have gone, but more German professors and technical instructors have been im-ported.    And if Turkey were to Repudiate her pre-war debts
to the various states now at war with her (whioh Bhe has not yet been so rash as to do), she would s$rill be left with her huge war debt to the German Government.In fact, Turkey, even within the limits her armies stilldefend, is less independent and less national than she has ever been before.    Militarily, economically, financially she is in Germany^ hands;   the C.U.P. are only absolute because Germany supports them;   and Germany supports them beaause their policy suits her own interests.(3)    As for Turkey1 b external aims, the Holy War has been a fiasco;   the invasions of Egypt, the Cauoasus and Persia have broken down, and have lod to counter-occupations of ottoman territory.    The secession of the Sherif of Mecoa has been a deadly blow to the Ottoman Caliphate.It is true that the Russian Revolution has opened un-expected fields for Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turanian expansion,. But the Arab national movement, which disputes the right of Turanians to Islamic hegemony, is just as formidable a force on the other side.     Zionism, too, has acquired a practical significance by the fall of Jerusalem;   and the emancipation of the Jews in Bussia and the intervention of the United State; have given Zionism a powerful backing.Turkish ExpectationsIn the early summer of 1917, when Talafat went to Berlin and Vienna to discusB the situation created by the loss of Bagdad, he is reported to have been convinced of a general military victory for the German Alliance through the submarine campaign and a separate peace with Russia.    To insure itself in the opposite event, however, the Turkish Government is stated fin a report dating from August 1917) to have arranged with
Bulgaria for joint action in the aaaa af a defeat of the Central Powers.How that half a year haa passed, tha submarine campaign has on tha whola proTed a failure (as a means to a epoedy and deoisire ending of the War);   but on tha other hand a asparate peace with Russia aeems to ha practically in Bight.How much will a separate peaoa with Russia help (Turkey? Tory little directly, for military operations have he en at a standstill on tho Caucasian front sine e 1916, and almost the whole military effort of Turkey is now directed against the British pressure in Palestine and Mesopotamia.    It would Only help Turkey isHhe Central Powers sent the troops released from the Kussian front to the Turkish fronts and attempted to drive the English out of the oooupied territories.    But the Italian campaign, the omission to send reinforoements to save Jerusalem, and the rumoured intention to attempt a break through in the T/est, all suggest that the Gfarman Staff intends to leave Turkey militarily to her fate, and to use the forces made avail-able from Russia towards getting a general decision of the war an the main front 0The C.U.P, cannot liks this strategy, but it is probable that they have acquiesced in it.    T7hen Tala&apos;at left Berlin in June, he is said to have carried with him a signed agreement, in whioh Germany guaranteed that no peaco would be concluded by the Central Powers without securing the restoration of Tur-key^ territorial integrity.    Doubtless the German Staff re-present that a general military decision of the TTar on the Western Front is a more promising means of procraring the evacuation of Turkish territory by the Allies than a local effort to retake the territory by direct military operations; and Tala*at apparently believes in them sufficiently to wait
Q -7-for the result of their grand Western offensive before at-tempting to recover the lost territories by other methods.&quot;The men in power in Turkey&quot;, wrote the correspondent of the Yosslsohe Zoitung at Constantinople in a remarkable artiole dated mid-November, 1917, &quot;hold faat ta tha Alliance without reservations, reckoning with certainty upon the recon-quest of the lost provinces by the help of the Ally who has guaranteed them tha integrity cf their Empire......*&quot;Great importance should probably be attached to the Grand Vizier&apos;s pronouncement, recently published in Constant!-nople, that he is determined to win baok these portions of the Empire, by force of arms or else by political negotiation.&quot;This indicates that Talarat means to wait till he has seen what Hindenburg can do in a new offensive, and that he will not make any separate overtures in the meantime - for he would not mention negotiation publicly unless he were referring to negotiation in concert with Turkey^ allies.It may be taken, therefore, that Turkey, like Germany herself, is not now ready for peaoe until another attempt to obtain a general military decision has been made, and that she still hopes that, even if no decision is reached, the military situation will be so inclined in Germany^ favour that Germany will be in a position to insist on Turkey&apos;s integrity, in ad-dition to the demands that she will make on her own behalf (restoration of colonies, access to raw materials, eto).That Turkey is still determined to recover her terri-torial integrity can be shown from various recent offioial utterances, e.g.(a)      Tala,atls speech to the C.U.P. Congress in September1917:-&quot;Vte have repeatedly emphasised that we are only fighting
for our existence, our independence, our free develop-ment and our progress.    7e shall be ready to enter into negotiations the moment our enemies make it clear to us that they are inclined to aocept these principles.&quot;(b)     Turkish reply to the Papal Note (September)&quot;Wo have been compelled to fight for the sake of our existence, for our liberty, and for the free development of our country.    That is the ultimate goal, consisting above all in securing the rights of our complete sovereign-ty over the whole extent&quot;of our dominions, which we still pursue to-day.w. (o)      Speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Chamber on December 6th 1917:-&quot;Turkey harbours no aims of conquest, but is struggling simply to preserve her complete independence, in order to be able to advance rapidly along the peaceful road of pro-gress.&quot;These declarations are of course drafted in conformity with the diplomatic position at present maintained by the German Afiii^o Alliance as a whole, but they also express, with remarkable identfc ty of language, the original aims with whioh Turkey entered the War.    These aims, as announced here, may be analysed as (1) Internal independence;   (2) national development aa a Turkish basis;   and (Z) territorial integrity.At present they still hope to secure all three aims, but if Hindenburg^ ooming attempt to break through in the r:/est were to fail signally, gala?at might then be ready to negotiate separafc-ly with the Allies, getting what terms he oouldj   or Germany her-self might be ready to negotiate for a general peace, in which oase she would get the best terms for Turkey that she could with-out sacrificing vital interests of her own.
i273HTurkish Aims oompared with those of the Allies.Peace by negotiation means a comparison of respective aims, agreement where they do not clash, and sacrifice by one or ether party where they do.     The relative amount of concession on the whole depends, of course, on the reactive politico-military posi-tion of the two parties at the moment;   but at the same time there may fee individual aims on which each party is uncompromising, while on other points they may be all the more ready to make sac-rifices in ,order to purchase concessions on the enemy&apos;s part to-wards aims odf the first category upon which they cannot bring themselves t* compromise.It seems, therefore, worth considering whaae Turkish and Allied Aims clash, and which Turkish aims are absolute and which con-ditional.(1).   Turkish Internal Independence,The &quot;furks are determined to throw eff the control established in the past century by foreign powers (partly separately and partly in concert) over their justice, taxation, tariff, finance and education, and to make themselves as independent in these respects as European countries.This aim affects the interests of individual nationals of the Allied States - firms doing business in Turkey (through the abolition of the Capitulations) and holders of Turkish government bonds (in the event of the abolition of the &quot;Administration de la Dette Publique Ottamane&quot;).   But these private interests could be indemnified and the public interests of the Allied States would not suffer by the loss, of legal privileges and of participation in the Ottoman Debt on the part of their nationals, unless their mationals were discriminated against in favour of the nationals&apos;at present allied with Turkey,     If this happened, Germany, through the
(sDecial position of German private individuals, would gain apolitical advantage in Turkey over England and France.     But theCTJ.P. are as anxious to prevent this as we are, for they aregenuinely determined to eliminate all foreign influences over theirinternal affairs, and they have no partiality for Germans or forGermany in this respect.     There is no question of gratitude, sincethe CU.P. believe (or at least have persuaded the Turkish people)erthat Turkey has done great/service Sto Germany in the war than Germany to Turkey.     On the other hand they are seriously con-cerned about the financial hold which Germany had gained over them through their war debt to her;   and, it   may be worth considering whether if the Allies bought up &apos;xurkey&apos;s pre-war debt from their nationals and then remitted it, Turkey might not take occasion to repudiate what she owes to Germany, or at any rate compel Germany to write it off herself.It is thus in our pewer not only to tolerate but to further Turkey&apos;3 aim of internal independence, without injury to ourselves -and this offers us a leverage for securing concessions on other points, on which Turkish and Allied interests may be at variance.. National Develo-iment on a Turkish Basis,The Turkish national movement was started tfter the Revolutionof 1908, took root after the Balkan Vfcr of 1912, 7/hen it wasadopted by the C.U.P., .\nd hrs developed very rapidly during thesueechpresent war.     The following pc-.ssc-.gel in Tala&apos;atfs/to the C.U.**. Congress last September, referring to the Dardanelles campaign, is probably an expression of genuine Turkish public opinion at this moment&quot;A State reposing upon a nation which has given birth to such an army as ours, has secured Itself the certainty of immortality, and has earned to the uttermost its right to existence.     Our enemies must admit this, and if they carry their intolerance so far as to refuse to acknowledge our sacred right, we will &apos;   commend ourselves to the orotection of Almight^-od and compel them to recognise it by continuing the war until they are converted&quot;.
This new Turkish nationalism has two sides:    (a) there is the -Pan-Turanian idea of attracting towards Turkey the Turkish populations of Russia and Persia.     This is certainly intolerable to us, since it involves the breaTk-up of Russia and Persia territorially, and is a direct menace to the British Empire.     But it is an academis idea, and there is no evidence yet that-it has really taken hold of the Turkish people.     As a political waa aim, it does not represent a national purpose, but is a weapen designed by the Turkish Government for increasing the pewer of the Ottoman State, or even for bargaining with if they are reduced to negotiating for the integrity of Ottoman territory.(b)   The other side of the Turkish national movement is the idea of regenerating the Osmanli Turkish people in its national home. This aim, unlike the Pan-Turanian one, has undoubtedly taken hold of the Turkish population, of all classes and localities, in the Ottoman Empire;   and whether or not they may eventually compromise as regards the integrity of the Ottoman State, the Turkish government and people will certainly fight together to the last for the integrity *f the Turkish nation within its ethnographic frontiers.     They will reuudiate any conditions which seem to them incompatible with the nation&apos;s independence and honour.It is submitted that we are here confronted with a genuine national revival of the Turks, parallel to the successive revivals of the Creek, Serb and Bulgarian nations within the dead body of the Ottoman Smpire during the preceading cencury.     To do violence to this move-nent would be in contradiction to our principle of &quot;the right of nations to settle their own destiny&quot;, and would put negotiation ef &amp;ny kind out of the question.     But it .may be possible to respect this Turkish war-aim, which is &quot;intensive&quot; afed not &quot;extensive&quot; or aggressive -3 the Pan-Turanian idea is, without detriment to the interests of
The questions here involved are (a) the maintenance of Turkish sovereignty over Constantinople and (b) over Anatolia;   rnd (c) the status of the Straits, (a)   Constantinople.For the Turks the possession cf Constantinople is equivalent to their national existence, *.nd every Turk who counts politically ha3 &amp; house there, so that in demanding the cession of Constantinople to another State or even to an international administration we should be proposing to turn the men we were negotiating with out of their homes.Even the Turkish Liberal Party, who have been driven into exileby. the C.U.P. and are openly Entento-phil in their sympathies, wouldnot compromise   about Constantinople, as was shown by an open letterwhich their leader, Prince Ssbah-ed-Din, addressed to Prince -iveir,the moment the first coalition government in Russia after the Revolu-tion had stated that free Russia had no desire for domination overother neoples.     In this letter Prince Sabah-ed-Din implied that theintention to annex Constantinople had been an insuperable barrier toan understanding between Russia and any Turkish Party, and if the Xliberals felt this, it is safe to i fer that the C.U.P. felt it muoh more strongly.The Turkish Liberals have been left out of account in this Kemoran-dum - (a) because they are completely powerless and likely to remain so; and (b) because they are really less representative of the present Turkish national feeling than the C.U.P.   The Liberal Programme has been sketched out by Kemal Midhat Bey, a son or grandson of the famous Kidhat Pasha, and now an exile in Switzerland like the rest of his Party.   Eemal Midhat proposes to transform the Ottoman Emoire into a federal state, on a national-territorial basis, and to put the Eette Publique Ottamane in entire control of Ottoman finanoes.    This is a return to the ideas of the period before the Revolution of 1908 or rather before Abd-ul-Eamid, when Liberal Turks and Liberal Europeans both looked for a solution in the maintenance of Turkey^ territorial integrity subject to internal reforms under the supervision of the Powers.    But the new international situation and&apos; the new Turkish national consciousness have made this programme an anaorhronism.
* *^reat impression is certain to be created among all Turksby the Prime Ministers reference to Oonstantinopla in his speechof December 20th 1917, in which he said that &quot;the fact that Russiahas entered into separate negotiations absolutely disposes of anycriticism there may be about Constantinople&quot;.It is submitted that this declaration of desinteresseraent withXregard to Constantinople   on Groat Britain&apos;s part is the key to any eventual negotiations between ourselves and Turkey.Which may be presumed to oover Adrianople and Thraoe as well.
If 278Since the Turks were practically driven out of Europe inthe Balkan War, their attention has &quot;been concentrated on their&quot;national home&quot; in Anatolia.     The possibilities of the countryand the condition of the Turkish peasantry there have been muchdiscussed, and projects of economic and social reform have beenastarted.    There is/certain unreality about this movement; little has yet been accomplished, and the obstacles are formidable.    Sut the analogy of the national revivals of the Balkan peoples suggests that this aspect of Turkish nationalism should be taken seriously. At any rate it is sufficiently genuine to make Turkey uncom-promising on the question of any cession of Anatolian soil.The country for which the Turks have this national feeling comprises the whole mainland of Asia Minor at least as far east as the line 8amsun-Kaisaria-Adana*Meesina (inclusive of all these places).    Within these limits the vast majority of the population speaks Turkish, and the Turkish language is gaining ground among the scattered Armenians and Greeks.     By leaving this country to Turkish government we should not be abandoning more than that fractional minority of aliens whioh always has to be sacrificed in a territorial settlement; and we should not be exposing the British Empire to danger.A statement about Anatolia in the same sense as the Prime Minister&apos;8 statement about Constantinople, implying that Greek or Italian aspirations on the Anatolian mainland had been given up, would be an almost equally important step towards inclining the Turks to compromise about the remaining questions at issue. And Beeing that negotiation depends largely upon good-will, it might be worth while to go out of our way to speak sympathetically about the genuinely constructive side of the Turkish national movement, to off-set the absolute condemnation, which we cannot leave unspoken, of their conduct towards the non-Turkish nation-alities in the Empire.
(c)   The Straits.The status of the Straits became during the nineteenth century a test question of Turkey*s sovereignty as a state, and the Dardanelles campaign has bound this up with the TurkiBh national consciousness.Assuming that one of our essential aims is that the transit-trade through the Straits should not be left under Turkey*s ex-elusive control, it may be taken as certain that the Turks will never agree to foreign interference in the Straits as a speoial case of international regulation, applied to Turkey alone and therefore detrimental to her sovereignty and dignity.Such a proposal would in fact imply that the Turks were un-fitted by their character to hold in trust an important inter-national thoroughfare - a Tefleotion upon them which the old regime might have allowed to pass, but whioh will never be admitted by the new national spirit.    Moreover, the Turco-German propaganda has anticipated this argument for a special regime for the Straits by raising the question of the Suez Canal and arguing that the international agreements actually in existence with regard to this waterway have been violated by Great Britain during the V/ar.Unless, therefore, we were in military possession of the Straits at the moment of negotiation, it would probably be im-possible to bargain for any international control of them except as part of some general agreement establishing similar control over all &quot;narrow seas&quot; - for instance, the Suez Canal, the Kiel Canal, the Sound, the Panama Canal.In other words, it would be difficult to negotiate with Turkey about the Black Sea Straits without discussing the &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot;.(iii) Territorial Integrity.If we can agree to Turkey!s other war aims, about which she Will never consent to compromise, we shall be in a better position
to bargain with her on the point where our aims and hers are at present irreconcilable - that is, the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire.It must be repeated that at the present moment Turkey shows no more willingness to compromise on this aim than on the others, because she still hopes for a military victory on the main front by the Central Powers.     But if the prospect of this victory were to disappear; if the local military situation were to remain the same or to changej if anything,to Turkey!s disadvantage; and if the forcee set free from Russia had been used up in the weotj so that no forces Were left oyer, in the case of a failure in the West, for regaining Turkey&apos;s occupied territory by local operations in such circumstances the attitude of the Turkish Government and People towards the territorial integrity of the Mpire, might change, and negotiation with them on thin question might become possible.The conflicting aims to be reconciled may be stated briefly as follows, in their extreme form:-(a)   Allied Aim:-To detach from Turkey all Ottoman territories outside Thrace, Constantinople and Anatolia; or, more specifically, all territories east of the line Sam sun-Kai ear ia-Adana-MeS^s in a.Motives of this aim:-l)   These territories are inhabited almost exclusively by non-Turkish populations; the Turks have - treated these populations atrociously since they first conquered them; during the present war they have treated them worse than ever, and in the case of the Armenians and Greeks there has been an organised official attempt to exterminate them, while the Moslem Syrians, the Lebanese and the Jewish colonies in Palestine have been attacked, not less atrociously but less comprehensively.In bargaining for the liberation of these non-Turkish
rm 281nationalities the Allies would probably be especially insistent in the case of those especially badly treated during the War (i.e. those mentioned above).     And we should certainly make a distinction between those for whom we have publicly assumed responsibility (i.e. the followers of King Hussein and Ibn Saud. the inhabitants of the territory we have occupied in Mesopotamia and Palestine, the Jews in particular, and the Armenians), and those towards whom we are under no specific obligation (e.g. the Ottoman Greeks, or the Arabs of northern Mesopotamia and Syria).2)   The possession of these territories gives Turkey a central strategical position between Europe, Asia and Africa, with potential naval bases on the Red gea and the Persian Gulf, as well as the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.     In Turkey&apos;s hands these territories are thrust like a v/edge into the British Empire, and give Turkey a leverage for working upon the Moslems (and especially the Turkish-speaking Moslems) of the Caucasus, Persia, Central Asia and Afghanistan.    This is a direct military menace to Egypt and India.3)   These territories contain sufficient undeveloped resources, and are capable of supporting a sufficient population, to enable Turkey to recover her position as a Great Power, which she lost a century and a half ago, and which Abd-ul-Hamid and the C.U.P. have each tried, in their own way, to restore.    But Turkey as a Great Power with a Pan-Islamic or Pan-Turanian policy would be an in-tolerable agent of unrest among the Moslem populations of the British and French Empires and Russia.(b)   Turkish Aim:-To retain all these territories for the Ottoman Empire. Motives:-1) The Turks, with their tradition as a ruling race, will not submit to seeing their non-Turkish subjects taken from them by force
ai^annexed by hostile powers.2)   They will not eubmit to being hemmed in in the Anatolian Peninsula andLiaolated from other  Moslem peoples by a belt of French and British territory, just as we will net eubmit to the British Empirfe being prised asunder by an Ottoman wedge.3)   They cannot give up the role of being champions of iBlam, which was handed down by Mohammed the Conqueror and Selim I, and has been assumed in turn by Abd-ul-Hamld and the C.U.P.*     So long as subject Moslem populations under Christian Governments look towards Turkey for assistance, Turkey will feel the call to play the part of a Great Moslem power, and for this the poesession of these territories is essential.(c) Possible Lines of Compromise.1)   The question of territorial sovereignty cannot be circum-vented by the old expedient of national or provincial autonomy under Turkish suzerainty.     Autonomy&apos;, ranging in degree from the practically complete severance of Egypt to the comparatively modest local self-government of the Lebanon, was simply a conservative method of giving the Ottoman Empire a painless death.     But the C.U.P. and the newly awakened Turkish nation are determined not to die,    In the words of the Emperor Karl&apos;s speech to the Austrian and Hungarian Delegations, they intend to be &quot;masters in their own house&quot;; they repudiate the doctrine that the internal organisation of the Ottoman Empire is an international question; and if they grant autonomy, they v/ill only do so on their own terms and at their own discretion, without guarantees.     In fact, they are only likely to grant autonomy in any form in order to compete with us for the allegiance of some particular nationality - the Arabs, for example,- if they retain any important Arab populations by the terms of peace - so that this solution, under present conditions, would not only fail to secure the subject populations any permanent benefit, but would expose the British Empire to greater danger.
6 v i 233Complete separation from Turkey is thus the only solution that can be satisfactory to the non-Turkish nationalities and toOn the other hand, the Turks will hardly consent to these territories and populations being drawn, even indirectly, into the political orbit of Great Britain or France.    their attitude (and also that of the British, French and Russian Moslems) towards King Hueeein shows already that they would regard a nominal &quot; self-determinat ion *&apos; of Arabs, Armenians and Jewish colonists which would bring them de facto under French or British influence, much as we regard the &quot;self-determination&quot; of Poland, Courland, Livland and Lithuania, b  which the Central Powers propose to attach these provinces to Austria and Prussia.A compromise over these territories by negotiation seems only possible if both parties genuinely renounce all political control over them of any kind.
(:   &apos; 284tZ)    Accepting the view that the aim of each party in regard to these territories is essentially negative - in other words, that each is chiefly concerned to secure that they shall not be left in the hands of the other - the solution indloated is mutual renunoia-tion.     On the other hand, these territories oannot aimply be left to themselves.    His Exceliency Boghos Nubar Pasha, in a memorandum addressed to the Governments of the Western Allies, has convincing-ly demonstrated that after oenturies of misgovernment,,culminating in the rtvages end atrocities of the w*:r, they will need uctive assistance over 5. long period of yer.r3 if they are to recover. And this applies also to Persia, whose fate Is bound up with the fate of the Ottoman territories in question.The positive solution therefore seems to lie in the intervention here of some Power from outside which is both neutral and strong, and that Power can hardly be any other than the United States.The United States ha3 become our &quot;co-belligerent&quot; in the war, but but it has not ceased to be at peace with Turkey.     It has a t*ad traditional connection With these territories through the Evangelical and Presbyterian Missions, v/hich have established them-selves during the last century not only in Anatolia but in Armenia, Northern Mesopotamia and Syria, 3eirut, and Western Persia.     It has a clean record of humnaltarian work and political disinterest-edness.   In the Ottoman Empire the American Belitff Committee during the war hoe won the gratitude of all races and religions;   in Persia Americans are pooular on account of Mr. Morgan Shuster, who stood out against the Russian authorities when he tried to re-organise Persian finances under the Anglo-Russian regime.    And finally the American Government seems prepared to act.Dr. Barton, President of the American Board of Commissioners
3L1Qfor Foreign Missions ..nd Secretory of the American Committee fsr Armenian and Syrian Belief, wrote as follows to Lord Bryoe on Nov.5th 1917:&quot;The first point I will mention is the movement on the part of the  rmenirma, headed by Nubar Boghos of Paris, through whom they are appealing to our President of the United States to take over the control and suzerainty of the eastern part of the Turkish Empire and administer its government until it is able to become self-governing...&quot;I have suggested some modifications in their plan, especially that the twenty-five year limit should not be regarded as fixed, and also that any good administration would wish early to organise a kind of legislative body at least, upon which increasing responsibility would be placed from year to year.&quot;A few days ago I was in Washington and had a long talk with the State Department on this subject.     I told them that it was very probable that the proposition would be made to the United States Government to take over any responsibilities in the eastern part of Turkey. With maps we discussed the area that might probably be involved, together with the internal conditions of the country. et*.     No spirit of opposition seemed to develop...........It is submitted that the renunciation of these territories by Turkey and the reconstruction of them by the United States would offer as good security for the British Empire as if Turkey&apos;s plaoe here were taken directly by England or France;   and that the wider the field we are able to leave to the United States, the more dis-poaed will Turkey be to leave the field herself.3)    The last problem - which is not territorial, though it dependson the didposal of the territories in question - concerns the statusof Turkey as a Great Power.At present Turkey is determined to recover this status and weare determined to prevent her from doing so;   and the conflict ofaims arises out of our respective relations to the Moslem popula-2tions under Christian - and especially under British rule.   Turkey&apos;s motive for playing the part of a Great Power arises from her positi5nIThe bearing of Moslem opinion in Entente countries on the peace-3(?ttlement will be discussed in another memorandum.
it ^286as the Last remaijiing^ijide^^ ;   and our oppositionto this arises from our possession of Moslem subjects who wish to improve their pplitical condition.It is submitted that Turkey will be more disooscd to resign her position a3 a Great Power (a sacrifice involved for her in the cessien of the territories in question) if   this aot on her part were ooincident with some definite extension of political liberties, on our part, to our Moslem (and other Asiatic) subjects in Egypt, India etc.    The precedent has already been set by the emancipation of the nineteen million Moslems in Russia, who since the Revolution have-attained complete civil and political equality with their Christian fellow-citizens, and are organising themselves on deme-cratic lines.     This momentous event is bound in the end to influence our policy towards our own Moslems, without necessarily bringing us the-advantages we should gain if we took &quot;some such step on eur own initiative, in connection with the negotiation $t peace with Eurkey. If the Moslems of North Afrioa, Egypt and India were to receive seme definite share, however modest in the government of the Empires to whioh they belong, they would be less disposed to look outside the boundaries of these Empires for emancipation;   while Turkey would regard a Prenoh Empire or a British Empire in whose policy their Moslem inhabitants had some voice with less fear and more favour than she regards us at present, when we stand, both to her and to our Moslem subjects, for the Powers that have done most to bring Islam under Christian domination.In conjunction with the factors indicated already - a iofcally favourable military situation at the moment of negotiation, a willing-ness on our part to forego direct or indirect sovereignty in the territories to be ceded by Turkey, and the possibility of finding some third party like the United States to take these territories in tratst
a - 287the suggested concessions on our part to our own Moslem subjectsmight reconcile the Turks to retiring within their own ethnographicfrontiers.     For in these circumstances they need so longer $eelthat the future of Islam was bound up with the existence of Turkey.and that Turkey&apos;s existence was guaranteed by nothing but hermilitary oower.     On the contrary, they could look forward to seeingRussia, France end Great Britain take their place beside Turkey asStates that had Moslem interests at heart, and oould look for friendsand protectors where formerly they had reekonea on finding foes.The emancipation of the Russian Moslems since the Revolution hasalready begun to affect Turkey&apos;s attitude towards Russia in thisway;   though her feud with Russia was older.and bitterer   than herfeud with England and France.     This makes it more advisable for us tto imitate a policy in the same direction, in order to restore the traditional entente with Islam which we inevitably sacrificed in making our entente with pre-revolutionary Russia,
i ;^     &quot;Hi.   Conclusions..(i) The Turkic-Government     unlikely to -attempt .to-makc peace until the Germans have made another effort to obtain a general military decision on the main front in the West.    But after that, whether Turkey seeks peace separately or in con-junction with her Allies, the settlement will probably depend partly on negotiation, and not merely on the local military situation at the moment.(ii) With a view to negotiation, Turkish war-alma hare to be considered.    These are (a) internal independence; (b) national development on a Turkish basis; and (c) territorial integrity.At prestnt the Turks are unwilling to compromise on any of these aims, but they do not Bet equal value upon them all, and may compromise on some of them after the last bid for a military decision has been made.(iii) They are not likely to compromise on internal in-dependence either now or hereafter: on the other hand this aim does not conflict with ours, since they are as eager for in-dependence from Germany as from us.     The key to agreement hi.re lies in our power of lightening Turkey&apos;a financial burden.(iv) They are not likely to compromise on their national development either; but this aim is no longer in conflict with ours since Russia has renounced Constantinople.     The key to agreement here is a declaration of respect for their national territory within its ethnographic boundaries, coupled, perhaps, with some expression of sympathy for what is genuinely constructive in the Turkish national movement.(v) Over the question of the integrity of the OttomanEmpire in respect of its non-Turkish territories, there is bound to be a conflict of aims, since regard for humanity and for our
(c -Kown political interests alike force us to insist on the liberation of as large a part of these territories as, possible from Turkishrule.On the other hand, the Turks will be more disposed to corn-promise on this question than on the preceding.The extent of the compromise will largely depend on the military situation at the time of negotiation; but so far as it depends on bargaining and not on the war-map. we shall be most likely to obtain from the Turks the sacrifice we demand, by offering concessions ourselves on the following lines:-(a) The renunciation on our part, as well as theirs, of direct or indirect territorial sovereignty over the territories to be ceded by Turkey, and also over Persia;(b) The consignment in trust of these territories and their populations to some third party like the United States, on the understanding that after reconstruction they are ultimately to govern themselves;(c) The grant of political rights to the Moslem inhabitants of the British and French 3I.mpires, of the same kind (though pre-sumably not, to begin with, of the same extent) as those granted Bince the Revolution to the Moslems of Russia.In this way we should come to be regarded once more, by the Turks and by our own Moslem subjects, as the friends of Islam and not as its enemies.16.1.18.
