&apos; &quot;vtflilntfocument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1918.SECRET.THE NITRATE OF SODA SITUATION.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;^recirculate a Memorandum which has been prepared in the Explosive Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.1. British Position.From the early stages of the war, it has been the policy of the British Govern-ment to accumulate and keep a large reserve of Nitrate of Soda in this country.On the 31st December, 1916, the Government stock exceeded 325,000 tons. At the beginning of 1917, the Shipping Controller was warned that, owing to the largely increased production of explosives, it would be necessary to deliver to this country 50,000 tons per month of Nitrate of Soda from May onwards, but very shortly afterwards the Iron Ore situation became so serious that it was decided to reduce the amount of shipping in the Nitrate trade and divert some of the ships to the carriage of Iron ore, and for this reason the monthly demand was reduced to 40,000 tons. As a matter of fact, the Shipping Controller has not been able to deliver to this country even the reduced quantity of Nitrate of Soda arranged for, as appears from the following table: January  .February .MarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember .Sailings.

France as explained below, is shown by the following table, which gives the stock held by Government at various dates in 1917: 1st January 31st March Mid-November 31st DecemberTons. 325,000 257,000 133,000 115,000It should further be noted that although the very serious nature of the position has repeatedly been brought to the notice of the Shipping Controller, even now sufficient ships are not being provided to transport the 550,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda which represents the much reduced allocation for explosives manufacture during 1918. It is perfectly certain that if 550,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda is to arrive in this country during 1918 (even if the rate of loss does not exceed 10 per cent.), over 50,000 tons of shipping must leave Chili every month as against the 34,000 tons per month average above referred to.During 1917, the actual average monthly issues of Nitrate of Soda (represent-ing actual consumption and stocks at factories in course of consumption) have been 36,000 tons. During 1918 the average consumption, after allowing for the anticipated cut in the shell programme of one-sixth, is 50,000 tons per month, so that even if the full 550,000 tons were actually to arrive in this country, we should still have further to deplete the stock to, say, 65,000 tons. No account is taken in this Memorandum of the output of Synthetic Nitric Acid from the proposed new factory, as no reliable estimate of production can be made at this early stage.2. French Position.According to a statement furnished within the last few7 days by the French representatives, the average estimated consumption of Nitrate of Soda in France during 1918 will *be 37,800 tons per month, although it is understood that for January, at the special request of General Petain, an effort is to be made to increase the output of explosives involving a consumption of 50,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda for that month. The total quantities at present arranged to be imported into France, including the equivalent Nitric Acid made synthetically at the Government Synthetic Nitrogen Plant at Angouleme, are as follows: Tons.JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJune20,180 19,700 31,370 23,900 29,350 12,000136.500making a total in the six months of 136,500 tons against a requirement of 239,000 tons, without making &quot;any allowance for submarine losses.The stock in France on the 1st January, 1918, was 26,654 tons, so that, apart from the diversion of the ships below mentioned, by the end of January the French stock will be completely exhausted, and by the end of June there will be a deficit of 75,846 tons.Even the present position of French supplies, deplorable as it is, does not reveal the full failure of the French, because in October last the British Government lent France 40,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda, on the faith of most emphatic assurances from M. Thomas that this loan would be repaid during the first three months of 1918. In addition, during the last few days two further cargoes destined for this country have been diverted to France in order to meet the February deficit.Further temporary relief has been obtained by the diversion to France by the American Government of one steamer of 6,700 tons, and another will probably be diverted in the course of the next few days, making a total of 18,000 tons. It is understood that this Nitrate of Soda will be taken by France in part replacement of some Nitrate already borrowed by the United States Ordnance Department from France.
France as explained below, is shown by the following table, which gives the stock held by Government at various dates in 1917: 1st January 31st March Mid-November 31st DecemberTons. 325,000 257,000 133,000 115,000It should further be noted that although the very serious nature of the position has repeatedly been brought to the notice of the Shipping Controller, even now sufficient ships are not being provided to transport the 550,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda which represents the much reduced allocation for explosives manufacture during 1918. It is perfectly certain that if 550,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda is to arrive in this countrv during 1918 (even if the rate of loss does not exceed 10 per cent.), over 50,000 tons of shipping must leave Chili every month as against the 34,000 tons per month average above referred to.During 1917, the actual average monthly issues of Nitrate of Soda (represent-ing actual consumption and stocks at factories in course of consumption) have been 36,000 tons.

It is understood that this Nitrate of Soda will be taken by France in part replacement of some Nitrate already borrowed by the United States Ordnance Department from France.
4. American Position.The following statement of the stocks of Nitrate of Soda in the United States of America and the estimated requirements for 1918 has been handed in to the Nitrate of Soda Executive by the American Representative: Stocks at 1st January, 1918.United States Government ... Manufacturers of explosives Manufacturers of fertilisers Merchants ChemicalsTotal ...Requirements for 1918Munitions FertiliserSulphuric acid  ...Nitric acid and general chemicals ...Total ...This stock, though apparently fairly large, is in fact barely more than a work-ing stock, because not only is the rate of consumption by explosives manufacturers, who are largely working for the Allies, very high, but also the number of works amongst which it is distributed is very large.The above requirements are somewhat larger than was anticipated, owing to the enormously increased demands for munitions purposes, but, as pointed out below, the production in Chili should be sufficient to meet this and the Allied demands practically in full.5. European Position.The total stock of Nitrate of Soda in Europe on the 1st January, 1918, was: Tons.Great Britain     ... ... ... ...   115,000France ............    26,654Italy     ... ... ... ... ...    10,000Total ... ... ...   151,654The average monthly estimated consumption of Nitrate of Soda in Europe during 1918, based on the full demands of France and Italy, is 108,800 tons, so that at the beginning of the year the stock represented about six weeks&apos; consumption.Tons. ... 56,000 ... 122,000 ... 82,000 ... 41,000 ...     29,000330,000Tons. 1,250,000 300,000 100,000 150,0001,800,0003. Italian Position.According to a statement furnished within the last few days by the Italian representatives, their monthly requirements for explosives during the first six months of the year are 20,000 tons per month, and arrangements have been made to ship only 17,500 tons in all, to arrive in Italy during April and May. The stock on the 1st January, 1918, was 10,000 tons, so that the stocks are practically exhausted, and at the end of June 1918 there will be a deficit of 92,500 tons. In addition, Italy is in extreme need of about 30,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda for agricultural purposes. It should be noted, however, that this demand of 20,000 tons per month appears, on the information available, to be excessive, and it is thought that the true requirement is probably not more than 15,000 tons per month. In view of the seriousness of the position arrangements have been made to divert to Italy two cargoes in transit to this country, but this step will only afford relief for about three weeks after arrival.
This figure makes the position appear unduly favourable, as, in fact, by the end of February the available stocks will be reduced to 87,000 tons or three and a half weeks&apos; supply.It is understood from the Ministry of Shipping that under the present arrange-ment of a circular trip from Britain to the Mediterranean, from the Mediterranean to the United States, from the United States to Chili and back to this country, with Nitrate of Soda, the round voyage takes from four to five months, so that on an average a boat can only make two and a half trips per annum. It thus appears that on this basis, taking one ship as equal to 15,000 tons of Nitrate of Soda delivered per annum, it requires ninety ships to meet the European consumption of Nitrate of Soda during 1918, namely, say, 1,250,000 tons, allowing a further 10 per cent, for submarine losses.6. General Position.During the late summer of 1917, the position in Chili got very difficult, owing to rapidly increasing costs of production, difficulties in obtaining supplies of fuel, labour troubles, &amp;c, and it appeared as if there would be a serious diminution in output. As a consequence, it was decided that it was imperative to stop the then existing competition in the Chilian market between the various European Govern-ments, the American Government, and private individuals in America, and accordingly negotiations were begun for the formation of a joint Nitrate of Soda Purchasing Executive, consisting of representatives of Great Britain, France, Italy, the United States, and Russia. The negotiations were prolonged, owing primarily to the difficulty of coming to a settlement with the United States, and it was only in December 1917, that the Executive was constituted.The result of the constitution of the Executive has been to stop competition amongst the various buyers in Chili, and arrangements are well in train for securing to producers adequate supplies of fuel, bags, and other stores, while negotiations are proceeding with a view to reducing present market prices, or at any rate to prevent any further rise. Owing to these arrangements, it is not anti-cipated that there will be any serious falling off in production which is expected to reach three million tons during 1918.7. Conclusion.It is clear that unless immediate and drastic steps are taken to increase the number of ships allocated to the transport of Nitrate of Soda, the manufacture ot explosives in Great Britain will be curtailed, if not during 1918 then early in 1919, in France output will be reduced to about one-half almost immediately, and will cease altogether in Italy during the next few days. It is submitted that the European position must be considered as a whole, and that as Italy and France can-not arrange the necessary shipping for themselves, either Great Britain or the United States must do so/January 10, 1918.
