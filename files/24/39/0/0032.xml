/A   \ ^(This Document Is the Properv-HIS iHt&amp;nfclc t$ajesty*s CMifftffflfji 7/147Memorandum by the President of the Local Government Boa.rd.The memoranda which have been submitted on the subject of the Maternity and Infant Welfare have not hitherto been discussed by the War Cabinet though the subject has more than once appeared on the Agenda.On the 9th instant an important and influential Deputation came to the Local Government Board representing all the local authorities Of England and Wales - County Councils, Municipal Borough Councils, Urban District Councils and Rural District Councils - and on that occasion my colleague, the Minister for Reconstruction, was present to receive the Deputation with me.The representatives of Local Authorities were completely unanimous in urging the necessity for immediately passing a Bill to give them the wider powers in regard to Maternity and Infant Welfare Work which are possessed by Local Authorities in Scotland and Ireland.   They strongly pressed that the further powers would give immediate and tangible   r-resuits in the saving of child life, that the passage of the proposed Maternity Bill would in no way prejudice the establishment of a kindstry of Health, and therefore that the Maternity Bill should be passed at once.My own feeling is that if this urgently needed piece of legislation is longer delayed and the Public Health Authorities of the Country continue to be hampered in their work, they will consider themselves flouted, and 1 am con-vinced that nothing would be more prejudicial to that agreement which is admittedly an essential preliminary to the co-ordina-tion of health functions under one Minister, a principle which has my cordial approval.I again venture to urge that early consideration may be given to the request which I have put forward for permission to introduce the Maternity and&quot;infant welfare Bill, a draft of which has already been circulated to my colleagues.The responsibility of refusing to submit to Parliament this small and simple measure which on acknowledged authority will largely diminish infant mortality and assist motherhood is very great.W. HAYES irlSHiii.Local Government Board,Whitehall, S.V. 1.12th January, 19IS.
