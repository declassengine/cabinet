G.T.3331

WAR CABINET

LITVINOFF&apos;S PROCLAMATION IN "THE HERALD".

Memorandum by LOrd R. Cecil.

(Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 320, Minute 1).

I have seen the Public Prosecutor, Mr. George Barnes and Sir George Cave and the Public Prosecutor has consulted the Solicitor-General.

The Public Prosecutor and the Solicitor-General were of opinion that if the paper and press were seized there would be little or no risk of successful legal proceedings by the proprietors. On the other hand they thought that since the publication was merely the printing of a document issued Litvinoff, the case for drastic proceedings was not strong; particularly as no warning had been given and they added that the praise of the Bolshevists contained in President Wilson&apos;s speech made the position still more difficult. On the whole they strongly deprecated any action.

Mr. Barnes was very clearly of opinion that it would be a grave mistake to take proceedings against 

"The Herald" unless at the same time proceedings were takon against such papers as the "Daily Mail" or the "Dail News". Indeed he thought that it would only operate as an advertisement for "The Herald".

Sir George Cave was equally against proceedings, being of opinion that it was very doubtful whether this publication constituted a breach of the Defence of the Realm Regulations.

I venture to submit that this case makes it more than ever necessary for the Cabinet to have a definite policy with reward to the press. It is probably impossible to introduce a really effective censorship on 

continental lines. If that was to be done it ought to have been done on the formation of the first Coalition or perhaps when the present Government came into existence. That being so I doubt myself the utility of any political censorship, though it may be worth while to keep in existence the power of prosecuting any cases of very extreme breaches of the Defence of the Realm Act. Certainly I doubt the advantage of casual suspensions of telegrams from Russia, such as the Cabinet have ordered lately. The only result is that the documents are published a week or two later with rather added force and they are published only by the less well-disposed newspapers. If they had been published by all they would have been accompanied by comment and criticism, which would have gone far to remove their danger. I believe there ought to be freer consultation



 
with, and communication to, tho press by the various Depart-iiBnts particularly the foreign Office, the &apos; ar Office and the Admiralty so that the true facts are; always at the disposition of the newspapers and also the view of the facts which&quot;it is thought in the public, interest should be taken.     3oyond that I would rely very much on the good sonse sna enlightened self-inssrbst of the nevtspacers themselves and abandon sporadic efforts at coercion.     The only alternative to this policy seems to me to be relentless and iron control of the press, -hich Is 01 doubtful-advantage even in those countries where it could be applied end wultl in this country be quite i mpra o 11 c ab I o.As far as Litvinoff is concerned I would try privately to -yet an undertaking from him that he would not issue Inflammatory proclamations snd point out that if he did we should have to ask him to leave the country as we should in the case of any other representative of a Foreign Government.(Initialled)      R.C.January 11th, 1918
