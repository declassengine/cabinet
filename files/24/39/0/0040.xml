Intelligence Bureau,SECRETDepartment of. Information. P^l^^ GHW/006B T 33&quot; 7 *fW5EIClY   R5^0RT   91   HOLLAND.    VI. i&amp;W (Jan 14th, 1918)In the fourth weekly, reoort of this series attention was directedt2 the formation of a new political party viz. The Economic Unionunder the leadership of Professor Treub, the present Minister ofFinance.     The programme of the -oarty includesParliamentary contr-1 of International Affairs. Protection of labour in shops ana offices. Old age pensions and insurance. Woman&apos;s suffrage, Taxation in proportion to means. Increase in the salaries of Government servants.It may be said that the Economic Union is a party of reconstructionwhich will certainly play 8 part in the General Elections nextsummer,, when the party truce and show of national unity will in allprobability disappear and a serious struggle ensue.The new party has on the whole not been welcomed by the Press,especially by that section which supports the Clericals andSocialists.     By the.former at is held to be materialistic andanti-religious, while the latter consider that it has been createdto serve capitalism and that it is also imperialistic in its amms.The real reason that Tr^elstra and his followers oppose it is thatProfessor Treub has consistently discountenanced the supply of pro-visionH to the poorer classes at prices bslow the market rate -the National Treasury being left to pay the difference.   As Mr.Treub, who is a sound economist remarked in a recent speech, such apolicy teas not a strengthening but a weakening of the nations ^ower.&quot;Alms in disguise did not raise the workman, they only dragged himdown&quot;.   Another reason which leads the Socialists to suspect theEconomic Union, is the firm stand Mr, Treub has made against the
nationalisation of private businesses which is one of the demands of Social Democracy.     With regard to the criticism of the new party1s policy by the denominational bodies as being materialistic, Mr. Treub pointed out with some justice th*.t the consideration of economic questions had been forced into the front rank by the war which had modified these conditions all over the world.   The prominence given to economics in his programme ia no sense altered the fact that in the la^t instance the world is and always would be ruled not by matter but by the spirit.     Only the State should, in his opinion, not interfere in this domain, where full freedom from Government inter-vention should prevail.   All Catholics as well as Protestants were welcome in the Union as well as all other useful members of society, provided only that they did not desire to put the State in the service of a definite Church or sect.It is interesting to note that the !Telegraaf, one of the leading Amsterdam newspapers, has warmly taken up the case of Treub and the new oarty as a fresh and vigorous element much needed in Parliament, and especially as a force capable of coping with the extreme socialist programme.   . ,  . /r ^Meanwhile Mr. . Treub Ts principal rival in the Government, Mr.v fa      c-ttJjQjPosthuma, the Minister of Agriculture, hers -goo-frggga, It seems evident that the constant friction between these politicians rendered the ore-sence of both of them in the same Cabinet, an impossibility.It is   unfortunate that Professor TreubTs private life is not al-together satisfactory.     There is no doubt that he is a very able man and incidentally a thorough believer in the Entente cause.    It is also clear that the Dutch Parliament badly wants new blood and especially the presence of men who can efficiently guide the State during the very difficult time which is certain to follow the cessation of hostilities.
- 3The recent speech of the British ?ri$e Minister has caused bitter disappointment in Holland.    It is hardly to be wondered at that in a country situated *as she is between the German hammer and the anvil of the Entente peace at almost any price with a return to realtive plenty is the one desire of all parties.   It is not clear wh y general peace should have been expected to follow the negotia-tions at Brest-Litovsk, but the Dutch are catching at any straw which seems to float in the much longed for direction.As regards the &quot;Sand &amp; Gravel&quot; question neither side seems to show any tendency to give way.     As the effect of the stoopage of cables by Great Britain is felt in wider circles the support eriginal-ly given by the Dutch Press, with a few exceptions, to the atti* tude of their Cabinet, has been losing in vigour.     The idea Of an arbitration between Holland, Great Britain and Germany finds the moat favour, as which ever way the verdict went Holland would be safe, while a concession now made by Holland to Great Britain would only displace the conflict and raise trouble with Germany.The whole conflict has from the point of view of propaganda been most unfortunate, especially coming at a moment.when our cause was certainly gaining in favour in the Netherlands.     In the end the dispute depends on military considerations, which are assumed to be of greater importance than the trend of public opinion in Holland.
