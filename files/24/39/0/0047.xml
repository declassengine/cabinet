His Britannic&apos;wajesty&apos;s Government.)(This Documfnwis the Property ofSECRET.Copy No.143/408 c14,1.18.On the 13th ultimo the War Cabinet directed theFUTURE OPERATIONS in PALESTINE.297/27138/395308/11*General Staff to consider a project for an advance through Palestine and Syria to the vicinity of Aleppo, andj as an alternativeo a project for the conquest of Palestine0   On the 26th ultimo a Paper was accordingly submitted, in which it was asked that a decision should be reached at once in order that the necessary arrangements might be made.     No decision has yet been reached, but on the 31st ultimo the question of the &quot;Military and Strategical Situation in the Turkish theatre and South Russia as a whole&quot; was referred to the Permanent Military Advisers of the Supreme War Council for reportcthe Palestine project in which It will be seen that General Allenby estimates that with the division now arriving from Mesopotamia, making eight in all, he could clear by July next that part of Palestine lying west of the Jordan^ and .as far north as the line Tiberias     Acre (see sketch map attached), provided that his advance is not opposed by more thaii 60,000 to 65,000 men. . He further thinks that he could subsequently hold the Tiberias - Acre line, provided that the enemy could not deploy against him there more than 70,000 to 80,000 men, and that his own divisions are constantly kept up to strength.     He is at present about 20,000 men belew strength, and if he is to undertake the conquest of Pales tins these men should be sent to him at once, plus 9,000 men as the usual 10% additional drafts to make good casualties and wastage as soon as they occur, or about 29^,000 men In all. He also requires a considerable amount of railway materialsI attach copies of two further telegrams regardingIf
War Officer S.W.1.14th January) 1918.If on the other hand the offensive campaign is not to be proceeded with and a defensive policy is to be adopted, we ought to give priority as regards drafts to France, send one division from Egypt to France, and consider what further troops and artillery can be sent.I hope therefore that the War Cabinet will now at once give a decision as to the policy which they wish carried out, otherwise we may later on ,have troops and guns taking no useful part in the war either in Egypt or in France.     I feel sure that the War Cabinet will realise the vital importance of time, especially at this stage of the war.(sd.) W.R. ROBERTSON,C * I * G. S .
SECRET. OPERATIONS. From:- C.I.G.S., War Of floe.Despatched;- 6 p.m. To:-     G.O.C. In C.? G.H.Q., Egypt. 2.1.18,49150 cipher.Your E.A. 657 of 20th ultimo.     Question of future policy in Palestine has not yet been decided by War Cabinet but I hope for a decision before long.   Meanwhile, please send your observa-tions on following points (a) You do not say how far north of Nazareth - Haifa line you expect to be able to place your force by June or July.     Do you mean by this that you expect to be able to complete the effective conquest of Palestine by then, understanding the northern frontier of Palestine to be in the latitude of Banias and that country to include the ares: east of the Sea of Tiberias to about the longitude of Mezerib? (b) I presume you consider that the force at your disposal, in^ eluding the seventh division, would suffice to hold Palestine when conquered.&apos;   (c) As regards enemy&apos;s strengths a large part of his force has been badly defeated during past few weeks, its morale is probably low, it has lost large quantities of ammunition and stores difficult to replace, and it is apparently very short of transport.   Nevertheless we estimate that before long you may possibly be opposed by 60,000 combatants, including some 11,000 Germans, and that by middle of February this force might be in-creased to 70,000 or 80,000.   We are inclined to think transport difficulty would prevent a further increase and that In any case the maximum force the enemy could subsequently maintain in Damascus vicinity would be 100,000 combatants, but that he would have sufficient surplus troops to relieve some of these from time to time-You will understand that all above refers to conquest and retention of Palestine and not to alternative policy of further advance to Aleppo.
SECRET, - .    u 1Operations.From:-   - G.0.C in C, G.H4.,   Egypt. To:- Cl.Gr.So, War Office *Desp 4pic1916.Received 8 aom0 4cl.l9180Ed. 683. January 3rdoYour 493.50 cipher of 2nd.   Reference in my telegram No E.A&apos;o 657 cipher December 19th to &quot;north of Nazareth Haifa line&quot; : occupation of defensive line only far enough north to adequately protect the lateral road and railway. Say a line from Tiberias to just north of Acre and with&apos;the right flank refused and covered by the Jordan &quot;river against possible incursion from Deraa.      Even without making any allowance for the stoppage of railway construction in order to -conduct operations against the enemy1s line Nablus-Tul Keram it ?irould be May before my railhead can be sufficiently far north to enable me to operate in force against the enemy1s lines south of Afule Haifa,     It would therefore be well into June at earliest before I could have brought up all necessary material and have my preparations complete for an advance against Afule Haifa and it would be July before I could expect to reach a line Tiberias-North of AcreoAs regards (b) my present view is that I could hold Palestine up to the line Tiberias-Acre with the force now at my disposal if the 7th Indian division&apos;were added, provided my formations v/ere constantly kept up-to establishment and provided that the enemy, cannot deploy for offensive and maintain during his offensive a force of more than the 70,000 or 80,000 troops which you mention under (c)*With reference to your fc) however, I gather that 37-ou think it possible that in my advance I may be opposed northwards by a larger force than that on which I had been counting.       The question is mainly one of what the enemy canmaintain
maintain on his single metre gauge railway at various points. I h;.d reckoned that south of the latitude of Deraa he would be able to maintain not more than 6-0,000 to 65,000 fighting strength or say a total ration strength of 90,000 to 95,000. On the other hand if he can oppose me by the middle of February by a fighting strength of 70,000 to 80,000 : probably I shall not be able to make any effective advance from my present line without increase to my force.     By the middle of February my railway will be only just far enough forward to enable me to prepare for an operation against the Nablus-Tul-Keram line. My fighting strength in infantry and cavalry was on October 30th about 97,000: it is now 69,000.     Your expression &quot;combatants&quot; presumably includes artillery, but the difference between a combatant strength of 80,000 and my strength at full establishment would not necessarily be a sufficient margin in my favour for a general offensive.     Even if I had more troop I could not deploy them until my railway line is doubled. Progress with the doubling of the line eastward of Mazar Bir El has not been possible since operations began and while forward construction continues it will not be possible.     Wet weather has greatly delayed railway progress which is now much less than half a mile a day and wash outs, etc. have done much damage to the line now in use.In any case I consider it essential to consolidate my position on my present line and to secure my Eastern flank as far as the Jordan and to dislodge the Jericho garrison.
