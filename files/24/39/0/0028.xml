DETAILED REPORT ON BOMB RAID CARRIED OUT DURING THE NIGHT 3rd/4th JANUARY 1918 *Owing to the uncertainty of the weather and for the purpose of training new pilots a target in the French plan of bombardment was detailed.Ten machines left the ground at 5-30 p0m. to attack the factories and railways in the neighbourhood of Maizisres- about 8 miles North of Metz.   Owing to the intense cold a considerable amount of engine trouble was experienced^, and several pilots were forced to return and start again on new machines *   As tho temper-ature on the ground was minus 270Centigrade, engines became frozen up when they could not be started immediately.Weather conditions were not good, the night being dark and hazy and without moonlight, and the chief landmark, namely, the River Moselle, being completely frozen over and covered with snow.Eventually five of the ten machines crossed the lines and of these only two managed to reach the main objective, the factory *     This was brilliantly lit up and a very easy mark.   Metz itself -was also well illjjjaot.. inated, and the anti-aircraft defences were very active, but inaccurate.   The remaining three pilots who crossed the lines, being unable to locate the factories, dropped their bombs on railway communications North and South of M**tz.4 230-lb. and 20 25-lb. bombs were dropped from an average height of 2^000 feet as underMaizieres Factory   2 230-lb.

Number of searchlights working appeared to have increased since the previous night. Visibility on this side of the line was good, but without moon-light, and pilots encountered low heavy clouds North of Metz. Maizieres Factory Itself was completely covered by clouds, Several pilots flew over the objective, but being unable to definitely locate It dropped their bombs on other targets.The lighting of the district was greatly subdued in corn-par is on with the night of the 3rd/4th,No active enemy aerodromes were observed.Bombs were dropped from an average height of 1,000 feet, and a total of 1,300 rounds were fired at searchlights, trains and Maizieres Factory.All machines returned safely,(Sgd.)

DETAILED REPORT ON BOMB RAIDS CARRIFD OUT ON NIGHT OF 5th/6th JANUARY, 1918.Hine machines of No, 100 Squadron left the ground at 7,50 p,n, to attack the Railvray Junction at Conflans,   Of these, tv,To were forced to return owing to engine trouble, and one brought back his bombs being unable to find the objective.   The remaining six machines dropped a total weight of 2,260 lbs. Consisting of 6 - 230 lb., 32 - 25 lb., and 2 - 40 lb. (phosphorus) bombs.     Bombs were dropped from an average height of 1,000 feet.5 - 230 lb,, 26 - 25 lb., and 2 - 40 lb, (phosphorus) . bombs were dropped on the Railway Junction itself,1 - 230 lb,, and 6 - 25 lb, bombs on Mars Station. South of Conflans.Practically all the bombs burst on the objective.   One large fire and one large explosion were observed.   About 800 rounds were fired into searchlights, machine-gun emplacements, and one pilot attacked a car proceeding along the road.The first pilot to arrive at the objective found it well illuminated.   Lights were quickly extinguished after the bombs fell.     The majority of the pilots found no difficulty in picking up the objective, being guided there by AeA. Defences,     A barrage, consisting mostly of what appeared to be phosphorus shells was bursting at about 5;000 feet.     Pilots were thus able to get in under the barrage.Considerable engine trouble was experienced on the ground owing to the cold, and one machine was damaged through engine failure.      All machines returned safely,-Two machines of &quot;A&quot; Naval Squadron left the ground at 2,0 a.m, to attack the Factories of Maizieres.       One machine was forced to return owing to congealing of the oil owing to cold.   The remain-ing machine proceeded approximately as far North as Thionville, but could see nothing owing to thick ground mist.     Twelve 112 lb, bombs were eventually dropped on the Railway Junction at Courcelles from a height of 5,000 feet.     Direct hits were observed on the line 4During both Raids the atmospheric conditions were not very favourable,, there being a heavy ground mist and fog in places, and no moon until after 1.30 a,m.In the Field,6th January, 1918..(Sd.)
