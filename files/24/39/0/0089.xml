(This Document IsJheJ^p^^g [iAL^^^0n November 2nd 1917 the Ministry of Shipping called the attention of the War Qabinet to the fact that the estimated importing power of the ships available for 1918 was 8 million tons less than for 1917, and asked that the programmes of the. Departments should be cut down so as to secure a reduction of 8 million tans of imports as compared with 1917 from sources of an average distance from this country.A Committee was appointed under the Chairmanship of Lord Miiner,.and on December 1st presented an interim report shewing reductions as compared with 1918 amounting to 5,550,000 tons. A further allowance of 2 million tons&quot; was included as the result of a more optimistic view of the submarine position as given by Admiral Duff.    On December 15th, however, the Ministry of Shipping pointed out that owing mainly to the fact that the reductions were made disproportionately on imports from short distances, a further reduction of \% million tons was required even if the more optimistic view as to the submarine position proved to be justified.This further reduction has not, however, been made and K the consequence is that the Departments&apos; programmes as at present before the Ministry of Shipping are in excess of the estimated carrying power of tho vessels at least to the extent indicated, viz: %i million tons.Owinp- partly to this general deficit and partly alsoto the following particular difficulties in tho Atlantic which could not have been foreseen and avoided, the importation ofcereals now presents a problem of the greatest gravity(a) The congestion and dislocation of the imerican Railways partly caused by new movement of American supplies, but aggravated also by the abnormal frosts;(b) The shortage of bunker supplies in North America;(o)
1(c)    Ths Halifax explosion; fd)    The very abnormal ice which has delayed loading and in some cases imprisioned ships along the Nerth Atlantic coast;(e) In addition,it was not until the beginning of Januarythat arrangements to secure the Argentine wheat crop were completed to a sufficient extent to enable vessels to be diverted in considerable numbers to the Plate, and apart from the general shortage of tonnage the late notice reduced considerably the numbe vessels it was physically passible to send to the Plate in time to load not later than March.(f) A promise of over   million tons af American tonnage with indications of further assistance has not been followed by the expected ships.fg)    The shortage in wheat supplies in America in the last three months of 1917 has increased the quantities urgently requiring to be shipped in the early months of this year*The deficit in Allied cereals has to be considered in conjunction with the British deficit ,   On November 3rd 1917, t. British Government assented to the principle that the transport ef indispensable foodstuffs for France, Italy and Great Britain should be a common charge upon the transport of the three countries, and the Wheat Executive is in fact working on the basis of equal treatment for each country.    To the extent to which Italian.and French vessels are inadequate therefore to lift their minimum requirements of cereals, the deficit must be added to the British deficit.Immediate instructions have to be given as to the loading of cereals in relation to the other-imports in February.The&apos;Wheat Executive state that it is Of the utmost importance that the loadings of British and Allied cereals in North America and the Plate in February and March together should reach
Against this the tonnage at present nominated by the Allies and the British tonnage whioh oan be provided does not offer a prospeot of loading more than 650.000 tons in the Plate in the two mwiths, and as this is dependent largely upon the movement of Allied vessels and does not allow for losses, the figure must be regarded as doubtful.   This leaves 2,060,000 Una for the North Atlantic for the two months. \Of this quantity not more than 1,100,000 tons oan in any event be railed to the ports and loaded in Iflarch (apart from provision of shipping).    To reach this figure will mean giving priority to cereals sver other cargoes for March loading.Even if the above figures are reached, i,e. if 650,000 tons are loaded in the plate in February and March together and if 1,100,000 tons can be loaded in the North Atlantic in March, this still leaves it necessary to arrange to load 960,000 tons in February in the North Atlantic, any deficit upon this being a deficit on what the Wheat Executive state to be indispensable.   It is this 960,000 tons that has to be dealt with in the immediate instructions to North America *The tonnage available is as follows--British yessels  ,135,8004Allied vessels 20710001,342,800As against this are the following British require-ments in addition to the grain:-Munitions 252,000Ministry of Food (Bacon &amp;o) 93,500Lumber and Oil 20,000Fuel Oil 100,000Ootton 50,000Canadian Military Stores 6,400Miscellaneous essential cargo 40,000561,900This gives the following position:-Tonnage

(only a 17,000 deficit still remaining), hut this is without iliowance for losses, and On the assumption that 1,100,000 tans of lereals can he loaded in the North Atlantic in March.In the abpve circumstances, in view of the general priority siven to food, of the Agreement of November 3rd and of the necessity i giving immediate instructions, provisional orders have been cabled ;o arrange fpr loading in accordance with the above proposals.-.Nft orders have been, given -tg reduce Admiralty fueloil

If, however, he Cabinet decide that reductions amounting to the same total fluid better be made on some cf the other supplies indicated -We, substantial effect can probably be given to their decisions communicated within the next few days.It is also proposed to cable instructions that friority is to be given both on the railways and &quot;in theallocation
