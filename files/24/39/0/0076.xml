p f to the War Work of the Board of Agriculture for a for the week ending 16th January, 1918.... 3ritannlc Majesty&apos;s Government.)rhls Document is the Property ofColonel feee/3 *340JBQP PRQPUOTJQff:The severe wintry weather prevailing during the week has rendered ordinary agricultural operations impossible but the threshing of grain and the loading-out of farmyard manure have been proceeded with without disturbance.1* District Agricultural Committees.A representative of the Board has, in conjunction with the local Committee, dealt with numerous cases in Ayrshire where agreements had not eo fax been reached with farmers as to the extent of increased cultivation to be undertaken..2- Compulsory Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 M.Under Section (l) (e) of thie Regulation the Board hare issued t-r-o Orders during the week requiring the tenant of a farrr-in Linlithgow and in Stirling respectively to cultivate in accord-ance with a sttheme prepared by the local Committees.3- frotoj Ploughs and Trj^pjtorj,.With a view to facilitating the work the ?oard have issued instructions to all concerned as to the separate duties falling on Executive Officers, Engineers and Drivers in connection with the working of motor ploughs and tract ore supplied by the ?oard and have impressed upon them the necessity for close co-ojeration and the utilisation of tractors to the fullest extent in the interests of food production.   The duties, may be defined ae follows:-(l) Executive Offioers to be responsible for the examination of applications   from farmors, the seleotion of fields suitable for tractors, all technical advioe regarding ploughing and the certification of work done.(2) Engineers to be responsible for the working and repair of tractors and ploughs.(3) Drivers to be answerable to the Engineer for the work done, the keeping of time-eheete etc.4* Leases expiring at flhltounday 1918 z Dlgposal of Waygoing OrotsThe Board have had under consideration the o&amp;oe of farms which will change hands at Whitsunday next and on which it is desirable that more land should be broken for white crops this season than is permitted by the terms of the leases under which they are held.   The Board are aware that difficulties will be encountered by Committeoo in their endeavours to secure the breaking-up of additional areas,required on such f urns owing to the failure on &quot;the.part of outgoing and inobming tenants to come to an agreement in regard to the division of the crops.The Board have prepared a Memorandum (copy attached) suggesting certain arrangements with a view to overcoming diffi-culties in this matter, and copies have been distributed amongst Committees.   In oases whore the parties concerned are unable to aottle by mutual agreement aril where the outgoing tenant is un-willin^ to acoept the terms suggested in Paragraph 10 of the attached Memorandum, the Board will, on a recommendation from Committees, exercise their powers under Section (l) (a) of the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 M.

Growing of Strawberries and Bush Fruit.In connection with the question of the growing of the above varieties of fruits at the,present time, the Board are of. opinion that while every possible- acre should be .devoted to the production -pf corn and potato crops, it is undesirable, in view of the value of fruit for the manufacture of jam etc., that the acreage under strawberries or bush fruit should be reduced.   They consider how-ever that restrictions should.be imposed on the following lines in order to prevent an Increase.in the acreage under fruit and also to secure inter-cropping with&quot;vegetables where practicable:-(l) Ho grower&apos; should bo allowed to increase his total area under -strawberries or bush fruit beyond its extent at the presentmoment.(2) Where a grower grubs up any..&quot;part of his strawberries or bush - fruit, he- may plant with strawberries or bush fruit, as&apos; the case may be, an area equivalent to that grubbed up.(3) There new land is planted under Paragraph (2)&apos; two conditionsmust be observed.: -        the land from&apos;which the plants or bushes have been grubbed up must be planted with a food crop; (b) the-       land newly planted with strawberries-or fruit bushes must be in*oer*planted with.a&quot;,food crop.(4) The food crop referred to in Paragraph .(3) need not be a cropof corn, rboto or&apos;potatoes; any vegetable crop, such as carrots, which is of real value&apos;may be grown between the ro^s of straw-berries or bushes.(5) Ho objection should be taken to the planting of strawberriesbetween standard or half-standard fruit trees already existing as permanent plantations.    In such cases the direction in Para-graph (3)  (b) as to inter-cropping will not apply.A circular embodying these points has been iaeued to District Agri-cultural Committees in the country.6* Station for Testing and Registering Varieties of Potatoes..The Board consider it essential that every effort should be made to maintain the present high standard of Scottish seed, particularly of oats and potatoes, and they.have decided to take, steps to safe-guard this position by (l).stimulating the production of good seed of improved varieties   (2) encouraging the production of new varieties of high merit, and (3) protecting the raisers cf 6uch new varieties from being defrauded of the reward which their.efforts deserve.With theso objects in view they have framed a scheme for the establishment of an experimental farm for (l) testing new and oxist-ing varieties of grain arid potatoes for their exopping powers, and (2) testing new varieties with a view to determining and certifying whether in fact they are new or are only old varieties under a new name.   In the meantime negotiations aro being commenced for the acquisition of a suitable farm of about 200 acres in area for this purpose.FECFUITI23 Iff AGRICULTURE.- (a) Military Service Acts 1916.(a) The number cf certificates issued by.the Board in connection with the scheme for vouching, agricultural workers in terms of A.CI. 1175 (i.e. cases remitted by Recruiting Offioers) is as follows:-...

CROPS PIT FARMS, THE LEASES Off WHICH EXPIRE AT WHITSUNDAY 1918.It is undesirable that any farm, or any class of farms, should be freed from providing a just share in the general increase of cropping desired for season of 1918.A certain proportion of farms in every county comes out of lease each Whitsunday, and of these a number will change hands at Whitsunday 1918.There is also a considerable number of yearly tenancies which may be terminated at ^liitsunday 1918.According to almost universal custom an outgoing tenant retains possession of a certain proportion of the arable part of the farm until the &quot;separation of the crop&quot; of the year of his outgoing; that is, the &apos;waygoing crop1 belongs to the waygoing tenant, who is generally bound to sell the crop at valuation a3 the proprietor or incoming tenant is bound to buy.For their own protection proprietors usually make it a condition in the leases they grant, that not more than a certain area or pro- . portion of the arable land may be in white crop in the year of the tenants outgoing, or, that the farm shall be oultivated on a 5, 6 or 7 j^ears1  rotation (as the ftaee may be) which would mean that a certain specified proportion of the arable land, varying from one-third to one-half - no more and no less - should be in white crop in any year.Farmers have now freedom of cropping under the Agricultural Holdings Acts.   This, however, does not relieve a farmer from the duty to leave his farm in the rotation fixed by the lease, and ohould he fail to do so, the proprietor is entitled in his counterclaim to ask compensation for any los3 or damage whioh may have thereby been caused.The condition that a certain proportion of a farm may be in white cro at the termination of the lease is generally considered to govern the proprietor*s liability to take over the crop at valuation; that is, the proprietor would be entitled to refuse to take over any crop grown in excess of the stipulated area.The present urgent demand for increased cultivation make3 it necessar that every possible or available acre should be in white crop, but i is not equitable that the whole value of the crop grown on any area in excess of the area permitted by the lease should belong to the outgoing tenant.    If it did he would be securing a grain orop from a certain part or proportion of his, farm to which he was not entitled.In many districts in the North of Scotland the first, second, and third year&apos;3 grass is considered as a crop which the outgoing tenant sells to the incoming tenant.    In such ca3ea the outgoer pays the rent of the farm for the season succeeding his nominal outgoing. In the South of Scotland, on the other hand, the grass land, generally speaking, passes to the.incoming tenant on the term of entry, sub-jeot to payment of the cost of the seeds sown in the previous year.In suggesting what might be a fair division of the crop between the outgoing and incoming tenant the conditions prevailing in the North and South must be kept in view.   It is therefore suggested:-
I.   For the North:(a) that the outgoing tenant (who pays the rent of the land)should plough, harrow, and roll the land, and provide the seed, and at harvest be paid 65 per oent. of the value of the grain.(b) that the incoming tenant should harvest the crop, and becredited with 35 per cent, of the value of the grain and receive the straw.11 *   For V-e South:(a) that the outgoing tenant should plough, harrow, and rollthe land, and provide the seed, and at harvest receive 55 per cent of the value of the grain.(b) that the incoming tenant (who pays the rent of the land)should harvest the orop and be credited with 45 per cent, of the value of the grain and receive the straw.- In this oase the incoming tenant loses the summer&apos;s grazing.11. The value of the crop shall be ascertained in the manner provided by the lease of the farm.Board of Agrioulture for Scotland, .   EDINBURGH.   5th January, 1918..
