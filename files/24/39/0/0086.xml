Colonel Jones(ThiaDocumentls the Property ofHis Sritannic Maje^s Govern426SUMMiEY Off BLOQKiiBE IHFOFOHHATIQHJanuary 11th - 17th 1916The German Government are systematically attemptingto embarrass oar negotiations with the neutrals by offering to supply them with grain.     They recently offered to furnish 100,030 tons of wheat to Holland.   The offer was refused, whereupon the Germans intimated that they would hold the wheat at the disposal of the Netherlands Government for use if it should be required.     They have similarly offered the Swiss sufficient grain to carry them over to the next harvest.   Our Minister at Berne considers that this offer may produce a ser-ious effect upin Swiss opinion, if we should prove unable to satisfy the current needs of Switzerland within a reasonable timi The Germans are also reported to ha-ee offered 340,000 tons of cereals to Norway in exchange for copper and to have informed thi &quot;Swedes that grain could, if necessary, be put at their disposal.12. SOMDIHAVIA.      Both Sweden and lorway show, an increasing, reluc-tance to come to terms with the Allies.   Our own negotiations with the Swedes are at a standstill.   It is three weeks since they promised to make us an offer respecting Swedish shipping, the granting of credit facilities to the Allies and the limita-tion of their exports to Germany; but they have as yet given usno indication of their views,The lorwegians appear to be genuinely afraid of Germany. They fear in particular that if they accede to the demands of the United States and stop all Norwegian exports to Germany, other than fish, the Germans will concentrate their submarines for an attack upon Norwegian ships bringing supplies po Norway! from America.    The Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs in an interview with Sir M. Findlay made it fairly clear that the Norwegian Government do not intend to comply with the American
427demands as they stand.     He especially insisted on the di  L-eulty of prohibiting the export to Germany of Norwegian carbide.The sain points in dispute between the United States and Denmark are as followsW   Banish Produce.     The United States War Trade Board ask that the exports of Danish cattle to Germany shall be limited to 6,000 head per week and that the exports of liarses shall be limited to 2,500 head per month,     The Danes desire to export 8,000 head of cattle per week and 3,000 horses per month, plus an extra 15,000 horses in January and February,     She Danes proi pose to limit their exports to Germany of butter and bacon to 38$ and IS/o respectively of the exportable surplus.    The Araeri-cans have agreed to this, provided the requirements of Horway and Sweden are met before the exportable surplus is shared bet-ween Germany and the United kingdom.     The Danes still insist upon exporting a proportion of their hides to Germany and Sweden. The Americans ask that Danish hides shall be exported exelu-sively to approved destinations.W   Imported Commodities.      The United States have agreed to accept the revised estimates of their requirements submitted by the Danes but they demand in return   fl) that all goods imported into Denmark from the United States shall be reserved exclusively for Danish consumption and (g) that the exports to Germany of Danish manufactures shall be kept within the 1917 figures and shall contain no metals and no imported materials, and shall be of no military value.Shipping.   The Danes wish to retain 450,000 tons of their
4283.shipping for Danish services; the United States propose that they should retain only 350,000 tons, plus 500,000 tons engaged in tnt Anglo-Danish coal trade.   Of the remaining 265,000 tons of Danish shipping available the United States Shipping Board propose to put 35,000 tons into the Anglo-French coal trade to replace the losses in this trade by submarines.   This leavest4230,000 tons of Danish shipping still to be allotted, of which the United States will retain 215,000 tons.     The United States and British Shipping Authorities have agreed to share the total Danish tonnage available for allied services (430,000 tons) equally between them and to pdol their losses.     The British share includes the 165,000 tons already put into the Anglo-French coal&apos; trade under the Anglo-Danish Shipping- Agreement, the 35,000 tons which will be allotted to this trade under the above scheme, and an extra 15,000 tons for general services.The United States Government propose to requisition the 70,000 tons of Danish shipping in United States ports failing a satisfactory settlement of the points at issue within a reasonable time.   .tNETHERLANDS.    The Netherlands Government are not disposed to accept without modification the proposals of H.M. Government, noted last week, for a settlement of the transit question.   They refuse to prohibit the export to Germany of sand and gravel of Dutch origin. They intend to restrict these imports in view of Dutch domestic requirements;   but they will not proceed even with this proposal if it is a question of yielding to British pressure.   They also object to our proposal that a commission of Dutch and British lawyers should decide what are the legitimate civilian uses for sand and gravel passing from Holland to Belgium in transit from Germany.      They think that the Commission should be exclusively neutral.SWITZERLAND.      We have decided to stop all exports from the United Kingdom to Switzerland of raw cotton and cotton cloths and
yams until the Swiss hare agreed to limit still further their exports to Germany of Swiss cotton manufactures.    Under our Agrees ment with the S.S.S. we have hitherto sanctioned the export to Germany of certain classes of tissues and embroideries manufactured from imported materials.     The Swiss, under cover of this eonces-sion, have supplied Germany with tissues of potential military value.     Light cloths lightly embroidered are being expressly manu-factared for the German trade and are used, when they reach Germany, in making explosives.     In this matter we are cooperating with the French end Italian Government?; and we hope that the United States will take part in the negotiations.     By the economic agreement, recently concluded between Switzerland and the United States, this question is expressly reserved for future settlement. The French Government have agreed to stop the expert of cotton tissues from France to Switzerland if a satisfactory settlement hes not been reached by February 1st.HUBS IA.       Turkestan may for the present be regarded as economically independent of Russia.     The Interests of the Moslem population in Asia have been almost entirely neglected by the Russian authori-ties  for some time, and their grievances have not been remedied either by Kerensky or by the Bolsheviks.     A Separatist Moslem Party has now secured possession of the Government depots of arms and ammunition in Turkestan.     Its leaders have formed an army and severed relations with Petrograd.   The movement is headed by Djounayt Khan, who is believed to be in touch with the Pan-Turanian partyin the Ottoman Empire.Several attempts to obtain the release of the British vessels still remaining in the Baltic have so far proved unavai.1-ing and we are warned from Petrograd that farther efforts are not likely to be of any use until next season.   We have recently been negotiating with feeir owners for the purchase of a number of Russian vessels in the Baltic suitable for ocean services, and the contracts were successfully concluded.     The Bolsheviks now    I
state that the commissions which approved these transactions were not sufficiently democratic.     They have also withdrawn an offeit which they recently made to release the German shiros at Petrograd for general Allied services.    No useful purpose is likely to bfe served by re-opening negotiations for the release of any of these vessels.UNITED STATES.        The United States War Trade Board have nominated Mr. Sheldon to be their representative in London.   He will have a separate staff and an organisation distinct from the American Embassy.    He will be competent to conduct negotiations on behalf of the United States Government subject to instructions from Washington.There has&quot; been for some time an unfortunate difference of opinion between the United States and the British Shipping Auth-orities regarding the allocation of Norwegian shipping under the An^lo-Norwegian Shipping Agreement.      Under this   Agreement the Inter-Allied Chartering Executive are entitled to claim Norwegian ships of a certain class on the expiry of their charters to pri-vate companies.     The United States Shipping Board are unwilling that Norwegian ships chartered to American firms should be re-moved from American waters;   and they have in several instances detained ships which were liable to be withdrawn.   We have now agreed that the United States Shipping Board shall retain all Norwegian ships which were chartered to American subjects on November 23rd.      The United States Shipping Board have definite-ly refused to sanction the removal of any Norwegian ships from the Pacific on the ground that these ships are performing ser-vices of military importance.SOUTH AMERICA.       The Franco-British Convention for the purchase o  the Argentine cereal surplus, noted last week, was signed on January 14th at Buenos Aires by the French and British Ministers and l)y the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs.   The United
States Government have assured the Argentine Government inconnexion with 1Ms Convention that in allotting supplies ofof Argentina.G1RMills SUBMARINE BLOCKADE.
