j QBE T. ,I.-5555.WAR CABINET. THE USE . OF POTATOES. ,BL BREAD.Memorandum by the Ministry of FoodThe importance of securing a general u$e of potatoes in the manufacture of bread in order to conserve available supplies of cereal flour has for some months been recognised by the Ministry of Food.     It has not been found practicable to make the use of a definite percentage of potatoes compulsory by artier owing to difficulties in obtaining the necessary machinery, labour, -storage and accommodation etcIn October last, in order to encourage-the use of potatoes in bread mailing it was decided to reduce the price of potatoes to bakers, and the consent of the War Cabinet was olrtained to use part of the flour subsidy for this purpose.     It is not anticipated that this will&apos;result in any additional coat to the State, as the subsidy on the potatoes so used will probably be less than the subsidy on the flour-saved, while there is the additional advantage that the potatoes are purchased in this country and save flour which would have to be purchased in the United States by means of dollar credits.Early in October an order was issued malting legal the use to the extent of 12of potatoes In the manufacture of oread for sale, and a scheme was made for the supply of potatoes at a reduced price to bakers through Local Pood Control Committees.A, memorandum was issed to all Food Control Committees authorising them to receive orders for potatoes from bakers in their area, and either to purchase potatoes locally, or to indent on the Director of Vegetable Supplies under this Ministry; in the latter case potatoes are supplied through registered wholesale dealers.A leaflet was issued to ell bakers through Local Food Control Committees and i*rade Associations setting out how supplies of. potatoes at the reducedprice can be obtained.Extensive experiments have from time to time been carried out,and it has been ascertained that in the case of domestic baking a large percentage of potatoes can be used without materially alter-ing the nature of the loaf, and in the case of bread ma e .on. .....commercial lines a smaller but still appreciable percentage can be used with good results.Reoipes have been prepared and made available fer the Trade,. while the Food Economy Section of the&apos;Ministry have issued recipes suitable for domestic use and are at present conducting a campaign to secure a general use of potatoes by home bakers.k Priority Certificate for a large number of potato peeling,steaming and mashing machines has been obtained from the Ministry of Munition^ and bakers have been invited to apply to the Flour and Bread .Section ox the -Ministry, to; the necessary permit to place their orders with e;pproved engineers,1 &apos; A further leaflet for.the, guidance of bakers has been recently Issued, setting out the best methods to be aaopted for the use of potatoes, the type of machinery required for bakeries of different sizes, and stating that the necessary machinery is now available.     Some 1500 bakers have already placed their orders with engineers, -
- S -It is thought that with experience bakers will find themselvej able to use a larger percentage of potatoes than the first Order permits, and with a view to seeue the use of the largest percentage] that may be found possible, the Food Controller has now ordered that for the present there shall be no limit of the quantity of potatoes that may be used in the manufacture of bread.     A Press notice has been Issued drawing the attention, not only of bakers , but of all domestic bread makers to the fact that although the use of potatoes in bread is at present voluntary it is the intention of the Ministry, as soon as it is found to be practicable, to issue an Order making the use- of a definite percentage compulsory, and. advising all bread makers to make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible to enable them to comply with such an Order when issued.0Attached are copies of the papers referred to in the memorandijIMLNIST3Y OF FOOD.15th January, 1918,Not reproduced.
