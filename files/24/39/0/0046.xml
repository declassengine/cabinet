29 *\O.T.,-3346TURKEY IN ASIA ANI)^ ITS PROBLEMSL Note^by Sir-Mark?SyfcesN- ca-^t^^Memor8napm;-Dj ProfessorThis paper contains nothing really ne?/.     It is the work of a very fine historian who is equipped with a great deal of pro-war knowledge.   Obviously he has not had the opportunity of seeing either the text or the maps of the Anglo-French agreement which tally almost exactly with his views both political and geographical.    I should suggest it would be best for me to see Professor Oman.   When he learns that the whole of his hypotheses were taken into consideration, I think he will write another paper.     There is only one point cf importance that he does not take into consideration and that&apos; is the KIZIL BASH Kurds of the Taurus,     I would point out also that professor Oman is evidently not fully acquainted with the ramifications of the Arab Movement,  this however could not be expected unless he ,had had very exceptional opportunities.(Signed)       IU syzeso14th.....January^ 1916^
