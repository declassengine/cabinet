I CIRCULATE this Note which has been prepared by a Committee of the Munitions Council for information.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.[165-1]
ument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.  January 1918.SECRET.A  NOTE   ON  THE   EFFECT   OF  AN   ARMISTICE   ONMUNITION  SUPPLY.THE following three conceivable conditions under which an armistice might be declared need to be considered:- (A.) The total cessation of all manufacture of munitions or raw materials for the manufacture of munitions, and total cessation of all movement of completed munitions or raw materials for the manufacture of munitions.(B.) Freedom to manufacture munitions and to move raw material, but all movement of munitions towards the front to cease.(C.) Complete freedom as regards manufacture and movement of munitions.many processes connected with manufacture of munitions are continuous processes and if once stopped can only be started up again after the lapse of a considerable amount of time. This difficulty is so great that it is unlikely that any of the belligerents would agree to such a clause.2. .A further objection lies in the difficulty of defining &quot; munitions &quot; or &quot; raw materials for the manufacture of munitions.&apos;&apos; Under such a clause we could import large quantities of nitrate claiming that it was for agriculture, or we could make large stocks of steel claiming that it was to be used for domestic purposes.&apos;3. Submarine warfare would have to cease, and we should have presumably to raise the German blockade. During the period of armistice, therefore, we could import larger quantities of raw material, our ships being secure from submarine danger. Germany would not benefit.much from the raising of the blockade as it would be a g!reat risk to allow her ships to leave her own ports, and now that the United States have joined the Entente the Allies could prevent supplies being carried in any ships over which they had control.1 A final objection to any clause limiting the manufacture of munitions lies in the fact that it is almost impossible for any belligerent to see that the condition is actually being carried out.For these reasons it is highly improbable that clause (A) would be agreed to by any of the belligerents, and least of all by this country apart from the sole considera-tion at paragraph 3.1. We should stand to lose heavily under any clause which limited the move-ment of finished munitions. The Germans could pile up stocks at their railway bases and pour them into the fighting zone, if negotiations broke down. We could pile up our stocks at the ports, but subsequent carriage of the stocks across the channel would prove an almost insuperable difficulty. If the armistice lasted three months, and if our manufacture continued at its proposed rate, 600,000 tons would(B.)[165]B
(C.)It is inconceivable that Germany would agree to any clause which allowed total freedom as regards movement and manufacture of munitions and raw materials for munitions, and at the same time arrange for the cessation of all hostilities. Tinder such a clause we should be able to carry raw materials and finished munitions from overseas to this country, and finished munitions across to France unhampered by any danger from submarines, and no equivalent advantage would accrue to Germany by our raising the blockade.&apos; If these conditions are exhaustive we must assume, that in the event of peace terms being discussed, there will be no armistice, but that fighting will continue during negotiations.*The chief elements in this assumption, so far as the manufacture of munitions is concerned, are -(1.) The difficulty of starting again the continuous processes essential to themanufacture of explosives and other raw materials; (%) The difficulty of arriving at any definition of munitions or raw materialsfor munitions; and(3.) The difficulty of any belligerent satisfying themselves that the conditions imposed are actually being carried out in enemy countries;* It might be possible to arrange a partial armistice, whereby righting on land stopped, but hostilities on sea continued. In such a case, there would be freedom to manufacture and more munitions coupled with a truce on la,nd.be filled during , the. period if : the. armistice was arranged for the 1st April, and 420,000 tons if the three months fell before the. 1st,.April. The total stocks to be stored at home by the list July, would amount to 900,000 tons if the armistice started ,pnjthet, 1st,April.r; Assuming that negotiations broke down and fighting started again on the 1st July, it would be only possible to get about 175,000 tons out of the 600,000 tons filled and accumulated at home during the armistice across the channel before the end of the offensive period (15th November) in addition to the current output, even assuming that we could carry a total of 61,500 tons of ammunition per week across to France. If the armistice were declared on the 1st July, and fight-ing started again on the 1st October, it would not be possible to get across to France any of the ammunition filled during the armistice before the end of the offensive period (15th November). The total carrying capacity during the six weeks the 1st October to the 15th November, would be taken up in getting across the current output of filled shell, and the balance of the stocks accumulated during the winter of 1917-18. Germany would, therefore, have a considerable, and possibly vital, temporary preponderance of materials.2. If the output of filled shell were reduced during a three months&apos; armistice to (say) five weeks&apos; output, it would be possible to get to France before the end of the offensive period (15th November) 75 per cent, of the output during the armistice in addition to the current output and the stocks accumulated in England when the armistice began. But if Germany continued her output at a maximum we should be at a very great disadvantage as compared with her, taking both guns and ammunition into consideration, if hostilities broke out again.The only conditions under which we should find ourselves in relatively the same position compared with Germany, at the end of an armistice limiting the movement of munitions would be if the armistice started not later than the 1st April, and only lasted four weeks. In these circumstances, we could transport to the fighting zone before the end of the offensive period (15th November) all ammunition filled during the armistice, even if filling were continued according to the existing programme.3. For the above reasons it is most improbable that Great Britain would agree to a clause limiting movement of munitions towards the front during an armistice. But. if it were agreed, it would be sound policy to supply France and Italy with raw materials to be turned into finished munitions by them. Both these countries could - increase output very much if material were sent to them. In their case, there would be no difficulty in getting the munitions to the front if negotiations broke down.
(4.) The inequality in the position of the belligerents if any restrictions are placed oh the movements of munitions.But although it is probable that hostilities will not cease during the discussion of peace terms, we must be prepared for the possibility that serious offensives will be suspended by both sides during this time and that hostilities will be limited to defensive activities, keeping down aerial observation, preventing progress on works, &amp;c, iii fact the sort of warfare common to a defensive front. If, therefore, peace negotiations are started during the summer, the expenditure of ammunition will fall from the offensive to the defensive ration.If filling is continued at its existing level, this will involve the -storage of large quantities of ammunition in France. Assuming that negotiations started on the 1st April and lasted until the 1st July, a total stock of 965,000 tons of ammunition would be in existence on the 1st July, assuming that expenditure fell to the defensive ration.This stock should be divided between France and Great Britain in the following way to ensure that with existing transport facilities, the stock stored at home would reach France before the end of the offensive period (15th November).Stocks on the 1st July: France    ... ... ... ...      590,000 tons.Home     ... ... ... ...      375,000 tons.If hostilities started again on the 1st July, it would be possible to transport to France before the end of the offensive period 285,000 tons of the home stock in addition to current output, thus reducing it to the figure at present arranged for the stock at home on the 15th November, 1918.*According to this calculation, therefore, very large additional storage capacity would have to be provided in France. Should the armistice start on the 1st July, the total stock to be stored on the 1st October (after three months&apos; negotiations) would be 810,000 tons, and in order that home stocks should be reduced to the present esitmated figure by the 15th November, 1918, the allocation would have to be Stocks on the 1st October: France    ... ... ... ...      605,000 tons.Home     ... ... ... ...      205,000 tons.If, on the other hand, the filling during the three months is reduced to five weeks&apos; output there would be no need to provide any extra storage at all, as thirteen weeks&apos; defensive expenditure is slightly in excess of five weeks&apos; output of filled shell.Assuming, thus, that we have to legislate, not for a definite armistice, but for a period of defensive fighting with no restriction on munition activity, the first question to be answered is whether the Commander-in-Chief can find emergency storage accommodation in France, for, say, 48,500 tons a week, less, say, 17,000 expended for every week that negotiations last, or until either an arrangement about munitions is arrived at or it is sufficiently clear that fighting will not be resumed to risk reducing output, even without a definite agreement.1. If the answers of the military authorities to this question is in the affirma-tive, filling of - ammunition will continue according to programme; but it is possible manufacture might be modified. The conception of a snowball accumulation of finished munitions in France is forced on us by the possibility of the enemy being at a temporary advantage if this is not done; but if the period of slack fighting lasts, say, three months from the 1st April, it is exceedingly improbable that in fact the accumulation would be used in the remaining four months of the campaigning season. In short, the stock position of &quot; completed &quot; munitions would be so strong that we could afford to run fairly substantial risks at home in the way of weakening the second and third line of stocks, viz., unassembled components (shells, fuses, &amp;c.) and special materials (shell steel, brass rod, &amp;o), respectively. Stocks under both these heads are at present strong, and under the assumed conditions it would be safe* In the case of a pirtial armistice as suggested in the footnote on p. 2, accommodation would have ta be provided for an additional 220,000 tons. It is assumed that shipments to the East will continue, and that no storage difficulties will arise in this case.In this case it would be unlikely that the army in France would want this extra stock during the 1918 offensive, and it would be necessary either to store it in this country or to reduce filling as soon as it was-known definitely that consumption of ammunition was to be entirelv suspended.
to stop off as much material as could usefully be diverted at once to other uses, and in particular to those uses such as railway material, construction of power stations, &amp;c, which are of value for both war and peace.It is suggested that a reasonable working assumption would be that the army on the resumption of hostilities would only actually increase its proposed total expenditure for the remainder of the offensive period by 50 per cent, of the accumulated munitions, and if this were so it is proposed to stop off during the armistice 50 per cent, of the material going into munitions. During the succeeding period filling could be reduced and leave the position at the end of the year as originally budgeted.   This is set out formally in scheme &quot;A&quot; (see Appendix).If, on the other hand, all surplus was subsequently expended, the material held back from munitions would have to be replaced, and though this additional material would not become munitions for several months, output could be kept up by drawing on stocks far more than is proposed in the present programme or than could be contemplated unless an additional flow of material were in sight. This is set out in scheme &quot; B &quot; (see Appendix). Both these schemes would release during the armistice, in the one case permanently, and in the other case subject to replacement, a much-needed supply of material to repair depreciation and to relieve the acute shortage of material in Trance and Italy.The War Office should be asked to state their maximum possible expenditure of ammunition in the event of a resumption of hostilities in order that light may be thrown on the likelihood of scheme &quot;A&quot; or scheme &quot;B &quot; being the more probable.2. If, on the other hand, the Commander-in-Chief in France cannot store the extra accumulation in question, it should not be produced, as it cannot be stored at home, and cannot be transported across the Channel. If filling is cut 50 per cent, it can hardly be replaced in the next quarter: both because the factories would not carry as large an increase and because it could never be carried across the Channel. The latter factor admits of practically no variation above the summer average on account of port limitation. If, therefore, the Commander-in-Chief cannot store the accumulation in France, the army would lose the output permanently, and as in scheme &quot;A,&quot; material to the manufacturing shops should be reduced by 50 per cent. Under all these schemes, therefore, material and manu-facture (including explosive manufacture) should at the outset be cut 50 per cent., and filling would depend on the answer of the War Office as to storage.In any event, the manufacture of guns must continue at the existing level. The manufacture of guns makes comparatively little demands either upon materials or labour, and any chance of strengthening our gun position during the early months of 1918 would be welcome. Moreover, the guns would be required to fire the ammunition filled during the armistice sooner or later. If the return of worn guns from the front were stopped the factories should turn over to new equipments.When a precise scheme is agreed upon, the Allies, and particularly France, should be approached with a view to co-ordination of policy.When the general questions of principle are settled, it will be possible to work out a similar scheme for trench warfare output, which requires about 5,000 tons a week of shipping across the Channel.
