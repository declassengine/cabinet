IFORESTRY   ADMINISTRATION. g ^Memorandunr drawn up for the War Cabinet bj^      J^ya t* gj^r^gurjt^^ and Sir John Stirling Maxwell.The existing administrative machinery dates from 1909 when the Development Commission was set up with Forestry as one of its prime objects, the Boards of Agriculture in England and Ireland being retained as executive departments and similar functions bestowed on the Board of Agriculture for Scotland on its appointment in 1911.The result has been utterly disappointing.   No advancehas been made in the science or practice of forestry outsidethe Crown Woods which are under independent control, no coherentpolicy has been adopted, the work of afforestation has not even been begun.We attribute this failure, first, to the fact that the financial and executive control have been separated, and, secondly to the fact that the financial control has lain with a body possessing no qualification for dealing with forestry, and therefore commanding no confidence .   Only one member (now a salaried official) of the Development Commission possesses any technical knowledge of the subject , a retired Indian Official without experience of British forestry, and quite out of touch with British foresters .A third cause of failure is found in the fact that theexecutive department;: have regarded forestry as of small ImpoF-tance compared to agriculture , have paid! but slight attentionto it and never grasped its national importance .        Their atti-tude may be judged by their inaction during the war..     Inspite of the tremendous inroads made into the British woods,no steps have been taken to prepare for reconstruction beyondthe raising of enough young trees to replant 10,000 acres andthe survey of a few acres of afforestable land in Wales .     Thearea of British woodlands has never been accurately ascertained,nor has any record been kept of the war fellings -     No.preparation has been made for demobilisation.The /
%- 68The Arboricultural Societies which claim to represent forestry in England.-end. Sco^lBnd^are-unanimous in desiring that the adminlstxatioia should be re-cast, and the control centralised in order that the problem of providing larger supplies of home grown timber may be considered ex  ^ whole.These Societies with about   ,5000 members embrace practi-cally all those who take a practical interest in the subject,-owners of woods,  scientific experts, practical foresters, nurserymen and merchants of horn&apos;    grown timber., while the bulk of the literature on the subject is contained in their trans-actions and other publications.   Having done all the spade woE-k, while, the Government remained inactive, they claim some right to be heard regarding the future administration.   Their desire for a Central Forest Authority is not due to any neglect of the fact that agriculture and forestry touch each other at various points.    It is due partly to past expericve, which s&amp;ews that when the two are under-the same management forestry is sure to be overshadowed by agriculture; psxtly to the fact that silviculture is a special industry which can only thrive under the direction of suitably trained men;  and partly to the belief that a comprehensive and consistent scheme of afforestation for the whole country could be more advantageously worked than a number of independent schemes for the various portions of the United Kingdom.They therefore ask for a Central Forest Authority,-(l) dealing with that subject alone,(2) with sufficient knowledge and experience to command confidence,(3) free from party politics,  and(4) endowed with adequate powers and funds.It should be the duty of this Authority-(l) to formulate a comprehensive forest policy for the United Kingdom,.(2) to organise research,(3) to direct and co-ordinate forest education,(4) to allocate funds for schemes of afforestation,(5) to encourage and assist private enterprise.
The   present administration has failed in all these respects A comparison with Prance may illustrate the present confusion. France with 23 million acres of wood and a large -forest service has a single control (Dept . des Eaux et Forets) and a single training centre for forest officers at Nancy .   The United Kingdom with 3 million acres of wood and no forest service beyond a small staff attached to the Crown Woods and half a dozen advisory officers, has three separate Forest Departments and eight centres for the higher training.In France, working foresters are trained in numerous State forests managed on scientific lines.   In England, there are onl3r two schools for working foresters, and in Scotland no school at all .While a Central Forest Authority is essential to secure s coherent policy and prevent overlapping, It is equally essential that the executive work should be localised in the three kingdoms and also in.Wales which contains some of the best forest sites .   We should prefer to see these departments under the direct control of the Forest Authority.   If, however, it be found necessary to link them up with the Boards of Agri-culture , that arrangement is not impossible, provided -(1) that the Forest Authority is endowed with a real control of. forest policy as detailed above;,(2) that It hat  some say In the personnel of the forestry section of the Boards , and -(3) that the head of each forestry section has. direct access to the Secretary of State .. so that it may be impossible for the permanent officials to make forestry any longer the Cinderella of the departments .   In France the head of the Dept * des Eaux et Forets is a Conseillor de 1&apos;Etat .The princijRki objection to this arrangement lies in the opportunities of friction to which It opens the door.To /
To sum up.   We desire to see this great national under-taking approached from a national and not from a provincial point of view, and entrusted to men really competent to direct it.   Since 97 per cent of the existing woods are in private hands as well as the whole of the afforestable land, and thegreat bulk of the experienced foresters are in private employ-ment,, the success of any la^ge scheme of afforestationadmittedly depends on the co-operation of private enterprise .This cannot be secured unless the administration, commandsconfidence .To perpetuate the present inefficient administration and merely pour money into it -,o meet the emergency created by the war, would, in our opinion, be to steer straight for another and more costly failure .If this chance of basing the administration on right lines is lost, forestry will be thrown back for another generation and we respectfully think that the War Cabinet will incur a grave responsibility if it disregards the clearly expressed and unanimous advice of the Reconstruction Sub-Committee and of the Forestry Societies.(Signed)    LOVAT,Fresident, Scots Landowners&quot; Co-operativeForestry Society .
