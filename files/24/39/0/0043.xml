r/THIS DOCUMENT IS TILE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 uOyERNMMli &quot;I  sjLJS-S-UE&apos; 226!   iMj 3343* WAR CABINET.I   0.1 A 3 7/36 3. 15/1/1B.I PROPOSED EXTKK3I0M OF BEI^ISH FRONT.I I attach a Memorandum35 by the Field Marshal Commanding-^I in-Chief in France regarding this question.   I concur inI his views.I Sir Douglas Haig had already expressed his readiness toI expend his front to   Barisis.   The -French , it is understood,I wished him to extend it to Berry-au-bac, but I am not awareI that General Retain has ever asked for such an extension.I The Military Representatives recommend an extensionI to appoint some 14 miles;)beyond Rarisis.    They give no1 reasons for their recommendation-:.I It is now for the War Cabinet to decide between theA Military Representatives,  who have no responsibility for thei] security of the front,  and the Field Marshal Comraandtng-in-j-j Chief,  who is responsible for the front and for safe-guardingI . his communications with England^\ The following information may be useful:-.] (a)    Before the present extension to Barisis commencedj on the 10th inBtant, the British had 36 divisionsj] in the line and 23 in reserve, while the French hadI 64 and 41 respectively.[I (b)   If the further extension to the Ailette is made;j the &quot;British will have 40 divisions irv line and 19lj in reserve,  and the ^rench 56 and 49^ respectively.If (c)   One corps, of three divisions must be in reserve in[l each of the four Armies as a minimum, - 12,H leaving seven divisions only in General Reserve at[J the disposal of the Field Marshal Commanding-in-r] Chief,,  which is too small having regard to thelj length of front to be held.(j (d)   The arrangement under (b) will be very detrimentalII to the systematic training of the British divisions, if as the divisions will have to be in;the line forif periods of about two mnnths and will be out of thejj line but one month.1 xI Also please see his Memo forwarded by me on 17th Ult,I This figure may be slightly reouced by the placing ofI additional divisions in line  i.n the South, which is in1 contemplation.
-2-227(S)     At present about 350,000 French soldiers are onleave at one time, as against 80,000 British..   This means that there is the equivalent in persamfel/of 15 French divisions on leave over and above the British soldiers on leave.     The French soldier, serving in his own country, gets leave every four months; the British soldier,  serving abroad, once a year,  and even this has only just &quot;begun to take effect, ^(f)        farther, as the extension to the Ailette willhave the effect of makingthe hulk of the reserves on the West Front French,  it follows that the main control of the operations will he in French hands, as we can only make our influence felt &quot;by having reserves at our disposal..(Signed)    W.R. ROBERTSOU,C .I .G. S *War Office, S.W.(l). 15th January, 1918,
2283 ji! CR HI, O.A.I). 678/18- General Headquarters,British Army In the Field, 14th January 1918*The Chief of the Imperial General Staff.in reply to your letter llo. G.l/127/363 dated 13th instant, I beg to point out that the agreement between General detain and myself was that my front -should be extended to BARISIS, and that I should study the question of carrying out rapidly a further relief of French troops South of B/LRISI3 in the event of the development of s German offensive on a great scale against the French Army.      I considered, and still consider, that the extension to &amp;AKISIS is the utmost I can undertake unless some merked alteration should occur in the enemy1a dispositions and the general situation.!&quot;or the vorious reasons explained by me in reports already rendered any further extension under existing conditions would involve an unfair sacrifice of our men and a limitation of our training, defence preparations, and reserve power to a degreeewhich X hold to be dangerous and unsound, not only in the special interests of the British iumpire but in th&amp; general interests of the Allies.The following is &amp; summary of the main considerations which an extension youth of BARISIS will entail(a) Dangerous reduction of available reserves:(b) insufficiency of artillery (especially 18-pdrs.)for the adequate protection of the front:(c) &apos; Increased demands for construction and maintenancework in the following services, the resources of which are already strained to the utmostRoyal Flying Corps.Signal Service.Trans portation Services.Tho case against any further extension of the British front has become very much stronger within the last few days owing.to the decision to reduce my Armies by 2 Cavalry Divisions.;    the failure (now apparently beyond doubt) to provide the men required to maintain existing establishments; and the consequent decision to reorganise the whole of my Infantry.   To carry out such a great re-organisation of armies in the field at all at the present eric1b in face of an enemy who is believed to be preparing to attack on a great scale at the earliest possible moment involves very grave dangers.     To undertake a further extension of my front simultaneously would add very gravely to thoae dangers.whether
229Whether these considerations are known to or were fully considered by the. Military Hepresentatives of the Supreme V/ar Council I am unable to say, or whether these representatives calculated my Divisions at 12 Battalions or 9.    There is in fact nothing to show me on what data or arguments their recommendation was based, and so far as the document forwarded by you ^oes it has the appearance of a compromise between conflicting claims rather than a decision based on strong strategical and tactical convictions, which conviction is the only reliable basis of action in war.However that may be I beg to state that I am convinced that any further extension of my front under existing conditions would be unsound and unfair to our own Armies, and would involve such grave risk to the security of the British front that I strongly recommend the War Cabinet to decline to agree to it and I request that I may be relieved of responsibility for any unfortunate results which may folio?/ if my recommendation, is not accepted*Without reports made after a reconnaissance by my own officers I cannot say exactly what force would be required for this new front which is about 25,000 yards in extent. But it is certain that the extension would reduce my reserves to at most 19 Divisions and I must again point out that while my Infantry is being reorganised a considerable proportion of my reserve divisions, as well as some in the front line, will be in a state of comparative inefficiency and unreadiness for action.(Signed)     D* HAIGField-Marshal, Commanding-in-Chief, British Armies in France.\
