tfThis&apos; Document Is the Property ofIntelligence Bureau,Department of Information.SECRETAWG/035322WEEKLY   REPORT   OH   GERMANY. jgXV.(Jan. 17th, 1918)The negotiations at Brest-Litovsk have been resumed after an interlude which demonstrated the strength of the annexationist faction in,Germany and its ability in conjunction with the military leaders to disturb the orbits of German dipiomacy^K&amp;hlmann may or may not have desired annexations in the East.     It is more probable that he did not, as moderate patriots in Germany, like those for example, for whom Professor Hans Delbrtlck speaks, wculd. regard it as a very grave complication of German Imperial and Prussian problems, if, in addition to the Prussian.Pales, millions of other non-Germans were to be incorporated on the East ef the Kingdom and the Empire.    But the German Foreign Secretary has had a to yield to the outcry of the Fatherland Party, led by Tirpitzand Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He has been compelled to abjure the anti-annexationist Reichstag Resolution of July 19 befere it had so mush as done its work as a bait for the pacifists and Socialists in the countries of the Western Allies.This he has dene on the pretext that thr original German basis of peace was only to hold good if ,11 the Allies who are in the field acainst Germany joined in the present peace negotiations.This declaration and the peremptory rejection of Trotsky&apos;s pro-posal to transfer the scene of the negotiations to Stockholm is regarded by the Fatherland ^arty as a feather in their cap.     It is noteworthy that, in an aopeal which the Honorary President of the Fatherland Party, Duke Johann Albrecht, has addressed to the membersof the Progressive (Radical) Party, he states that large numbers of the adherents of that Party throughout the country have joined his
organisation.     There is no reason to doubt the truth of this stateT ment.     The Fatherland organisation like the Colonial Society and the Navy League befere it has evidently a great recruiting power and where it has attracted even a mere handful of people of local influence it can upon occasion preduce the effect of an imposing expression of Mpubltfc opinion&quot;.The proceedings at Brest-Litovsk have shown how nrompt German statesmen are in turning to account declarations by bodies which profess to be representative of nationalities without any popular mandate.     It is difficult to see what tactical plan, if any, Trotsky and the Bolshevik Government are pursuing at these con-ferences.     So far as the arguments which Trotsky has brought forward are concerned, it really looks as if they were designed to enable the Germans invariably to have the best of it.     It is true that we have solely German accounts of the latest proceedings, but as the Russians have succoeded in getting a written record of the main points drawn up, it may be assumed that the German re-port is substantially correct.     The German argument that owing to difficulty of communications Stockholm would not be so suitable a meeting-place as Brest-Litovsk was diifffcult to refute.     It w?.s r-lso from the Germun coint of view to be suspected that one of the objects of the Bolsheviks whs to bring Entente or neutrcl influences to besr at Stockholm uoon the course of the negotiations.   Liberal onin&amp;tfn in Germuny was, nevertheless, by no means uncompromising on this question,   as    *- leading article in the Frankfurter Zeltung during the interruption of the negotiations showed.Here as in other and more important matters, however, the declara-tion of the policy of the Government by Count Hertling and his reference to the military strength of Germany&apos;s position (unserc l^chstellung) at once won the assent of all parties in the Reichstag,
except the two sections of the Social Democrats.     It rallied to his support not only the mutually uncongenial National Liberals and the Catholic Centre hut also, as is expressly stated by their leading newspaper organ, the Progressives.The main controversy at Brest-Litovsk continues to turn ucon the right of the Diets of Courland and Lithuania to demand on behalf of these countries their severance from Russia and, in the case of Courland, the &quot;orotection&quot;of the German Empire,   General Hoffmann, the military representative of Germany&apos;s &quot;Machtatellung&quot;, was appropriately chosen to state the German case in this regard. It was that (e) On September 21, 1917 the Courland Diet &quot;which expressly described itself as representing the entire population of Courland&quot; requested the protection of the German Empire. Further on December E7 the Municipal Council of Riga made a similar request of the German Empire, a request which was suboor-ted by the Great Guilds, representatives of the rural population and 70 Riga societies;    (b)   that on December 11, 1917 the Lithuanian Diet &quot;recognised by Lithuanians at home and abroad as the sole representative of the Lithuanian people&apos;/ oroclaimed its desire for severance from ail constitutional connections which have hitherto existed with other peoples;   (c)   that in December 1917, &quot;representatives of the knighthood, the rural, urban and ecclesiastical communities on the islands of Oesel, Dago and Moon &quot;in vrrious declarations severed themselves from their previouscconnection.Trotsky&apos;8 challenge of the German position deals with two main points.     After long discussion he wos brought to admit that, failing any really representative body in the territories in question, the declarations made by Diets, Estates and so forth
might be regarded as a preliminary expression of opinion.     As to their absolute value, however, they could be admitted as the out nion of only those sections of the population which they represented, and not of the whole.     The final expression of the &quot;national^ coinion in the debatable territories must be obtained by the ver-diet of the whole population.These views ot the Bolshevik negotiations have found some support in Germany.     It may be taken that they roughly represent the cpin-iohs of both sections of the German Social Democrats.     They have-4/also evoked at least an outward show of acquiesence on the part&apos; of some of the Progressives (Radicals).    The leading Radical news-paper, the Frankfurter Seitung. says&quot;It is true that the National Assemblies (Landesver-sammlungen) in Lithuania and Courland, which each consist of 80 members and are in the main composed on the basis of Estates, cen only be -regarded as a makeshift.   But Germany is ready, under more orderly conditions than those which at present prevail, to have a popular vote on a braad basis taken at a later stage, and che is willing to submit to the result of this vote.     Where is the coercion in this?&quot;General Hoffman&apos;s reply to Trotsky on this point was certainly effective.   He said :-The Russian delegation demands for the occupied territories the applioatlon of a right of self-determina-tion of peoples in a manner and to an extent which its Government does not apply in its own country.     Its Government is founded purely on power which ruthlessly suppresses by force all who differ from it.     Everyone with different views is simply, as a counter-revolutionary and a bourgeois, declared to be an outlaw&quot;.The second point on which the Russian Delegation challengedGerman policy was the continued military occupation of thedebatable territories.     They did not consider that during theforeign military occupation there could be constituted in ^oland,Lithuania or Courland &quot;any democratically elected organs whichcould rightly lay claim to be considered as expressing the will oflarge circles of the population as regards the substance of any
declaration dealing with any effort to attain complete State inde-pendence&quot;.General Hoffmann&apos;s reply to these representations was categorical. He sAid:-&quot;Por technical administrative reasons the supreme German Army Command must refuse to evacuate Courland, Lithuania, Riga and the Islands in the Riga Gulf.     Hone of these regions have administrative organs, legal or judicial organs, reilways,telegraphs or posts.     All is in German possession under German management&quot;General   Hoffmann added that these regions would he unaale withinmeasureahle time, owing to lack of the appropriate organs, toestablish their own militia or soldiery.     This was a reply te theRussian suggestion that in these regions order could be preservedby a local militia until the vote of the population could be takenwith regard te their political future.In a word it seems as if the Germans were not going te let gotheir hold of the occupied regions of the former Russian Empire,and they are able to put forward very plausible reasons for thecourse they are pursuing.     As to their ultimate objects, theCologne Gazette   is probably near the mark when it says   &quot;Deedsand decisive blows which bring world-peace - these have htoughtus to meet the Russians at Brest-Litovsk, and we shall pick therethe fruit that is ripe,&quot;While this report is being written the news arrives of a fresh deadlock at Brest-Lit$vsk.     The Russian Delegation on Staurday January 12 formulated in a very rigid form their views whioh have been set forth in the foregoing pages on the sublet of the &quot;self-determination&quot; of the different nationalities in the West of the former Russian Empire,and the necessity of the evacuation of their territories by the enemy as a preliminary condition of a popular referendum.      &quot;The voting&quot; they maintain,  &quot;must take pl?ce after
wt    Q    mthe withdrawal of foreign armies and the return of fugitives and of the population removed since the beginning of the war.H     (The last clause refers mainly to the Poles, many thousands of whom have been deported and set to work in Germany.)     Further &quot;the final solution of the question of the State position of the territories in question and the form of their State organisation will follow by a.general referendum&quot;.     (This proposal is in direct contradiction to the German lSmperorfs New Year message to the Polish Council of State in which he already defers to the &quot;Kingdom of Poland&quot;.)Herr von Ktlhlmann thus found himself up against a solid obstacle to any real progress in the negotiations.     The Russian proposals had been put before the Conference in writing and thus constitute a record which the German accounts of the proceedings are unable to misrepresent.    Kflhlmann found this method very inconvenient from the German point of view and said so.     In vain did Trotsky urge that he did not desire to impose upon the other side a method of written declarations.     Hor did he desire to force an immediate discussion of the present declaration.     That could be reserved for a future stage of the negotiations.     Kflhlmann could not consent to this procedure.     The pressure which is being put upon him at home and by the military leaders is too grc-at.     He does not want to return once more to Berlin under the necessity of seeking fresh instructions on the plea that the Russians will not give way.
In Berlin and throughout Germany the agitation of theAnnexationieta hae &quot;been assuming extreme forms.     One of theirmethods is to send telegrams by the thousand to the Chancellor,Count Hertling, warning him against anything save a militarypeace.     It is believed that the profiteering backers of theFatherland Party and other associations are paying for thesetelegrams, some of which have lately been addressed direct to theEmperor.    The attacks of the annexationist newspapers uponiCuhlmann are of unexampled virulence.    The reports of Ludendorff *sresignation as a protest against the Christmas Day attempt ofKlhlmann to conciliate the Russians by general assurances on thesubject of the debatable territories are maintained long afterthis particular incident, whatever its precise nature was, hasbeen closed and the existence of Ludendorff&apos;s resignation officiallydenied.     One of the newspapers (the Deutsche Zeitung) goes&apos;so faras to announce:&quot;In political circles it is believed that the ^Imperial Chancellor, Count Hertling, also makes his continuance in office dependent upon the continued leadership of the Army by Kindenburg and Ludendorff.     The Ktfhlmann question would thus have become merely a personal question.&quot;This is nothing else than a conditional demand for theremoval of Mhlmann from office.*Another journal, Pan-German, asks:&quot;Y/ho i^ this Herr von KiJlhlmann who, for the second time, has conjured up a crisis, the consequences of which would be incalculable?&quot;and goes on to attack his career as a diplomat.     K&amp;hlmann isdescribed as having &quot;returned to Berlin with empty hands&quot; andas having &quot;failed to secure even the small military guaranteeswhich the Chief Command of the Army regarded as indispensable&quot;.Yet &quot;in the Council of the Crown he carried the day&quot;.It is not only in the press that the Annexationists havebeen making a display of violence.     Last week the Fatherland Partyconvened a meeting in Berlin to which they invited members of the
new League of men who fought and suffered in the war.     This League advocates an early peace and comhats annexationiet schemes which would delay it.     Its members were invited to the Fatherland Party meeting with the express assurance that they would he allowed to state their case.     But when they went to the meeting, wearing their iron crosses, they found that on the ground of alleged police instructions they were not allowed to take any part in the discussion.     They consequently indulged in what are described as &quot;quite parliamentary&quot; interruptions of the Annexation-ist speakers.     One of these, the National Liberal and Pan-German Deputy, Herr Fuhrmann, who happens to enjoy a dispensation from military service, retaliated by describing the interrupters as &quot;deserters who had abandoned the flags of Hindenburg and Luden-dorff, in order to stab in the back their comrades at the front&quot;. An invalid soldier protested against this calumny, whereupon he was beaten by the Annexationists and ejected from the hall.     A scene of general disorder followed, in which wounded and mutilated soldiers were called &quot;serfs of England&quot; and were 3truck with sticks and umbrellas.     Many of these old soldiers are so indignant at the treatment they received that they have collected the iron crosses bestowed upon them in the field and sent them to the Central Committee of the Fatherland Party.     This is an incident which has no precedent in German military hi story. 7,     The ranks of the Independent Socialists will probably be further recruited as a result of the promised impartial enforcement of the food requirements.     Hitherto the great munition works and other big industrial establishments have been buying food on a large scale direct from the producers in order to feed their employee   to the detriment of the food-supply of the poorer classes. In consequence of the revelations which were recently made on this subject by one of the Berlin suburban municipalities the Food Controller, Herr von V/aldow, lias announced that he will henceforth
Impartially enforce the law.    If he does, the workmen hitherto privileged in the matter of food will probably go over to the extreme Socialist opposition, led by Haase.    He has begun his campaign by instituting proceedings against the heads of the municipality, Neu-Kolln, which made the disclosures and which admitted that in view of the scarcity of food in that community it had endeavoured to secure a supply by direct purohaee from the producers.    But it appears that on one occasion a number of waggons of cabbage which 3feu-K811n had secured at fourteen marks per cwt. were directed to the firm of Krupp which had subsequently offered seventeen marks.     The Socialist press is now asking whether the Food Controller is going to prosecute Krupp.17.1.18.
