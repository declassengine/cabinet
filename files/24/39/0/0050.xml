Ash/ThJADr^u^ent is the PropertjMg^ ( His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)Maternity and Child Welfare BillMemorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction1.       I have read Mr, Hayes Pisher!s memorandum of the 12th January (C-.T.    3532)&apos;on this subject.    The details of the Bill which he is anxious to introduce were not discussed with the deputation from representatives of local authorities to which he refers.     I doubt whether the extension of new powei^s to the hundreds of Rural District and small Urban District Councils which he proposes will meet with the approbation which he expects from the larger health authorities, when they come to give a reasoned consideration to the Bill.2.       I am unable to agree ?/ith the Local Government Board and the representatives of local authorities (who are not familiar with the ramifications of Health Insurance on the existing confusion between central health, authorities) that it is by any means clear that the passage of the Bill &quot;will in no way prejudice the establishment of a Ministry of Health&quot;.3.       I should prefer to see Mr. Hayes FisherTs cordial approval of the principle Involved in the establishment of such a Ministry translated into action before we are faced with the health. problems, novel and urgent in character, which I believe must arise immediately upon the conclusion of the War.4.       But the War Cabinet are fully cognisant of my vie^s on the relation between the one set of proposals and the other, and I will content myself with adding that after talcing considerable pains to familiarise myself with the vie?fs of the representative a of Health Insurance organisations on the whole question, I believe that they axe genuinely convinced that the establishment of a Ministry of Health should precede or ^ccoiapaxty the introduction of any measure for the protection of the health of mothers andV
childron, and that the introduction of a Bill which Ignores their share in the health administration of the country, and postpones the establishment of the Ministry, is bound to arouse their opposition.5.       I do not believe this opposition to be factious, and I do not know how.Mr. Hayes Fisher would advise the Government to remove it or to over-ride it.   My own view is that, putting aside the possibilities of opposition from other quarters, the minimum amendments which the War Cabinet would do well to have inserted in the Bill, If they decide that it should be introduced In preference to a bolder measure, are as follows:(1)    Clause 1 should be amended so.as to make the localauthorities for the purposes of the Act at least as large as the authorities under the Education Act of 1902.(2)   Provision should be made for the co-option of persons, notbeing members of the local authority, with special experience of the administration of measures relating to public health, including national Health Insurance, on the Committees administering the Act.Clause 1 should, be amended to provide that the arrangements of local authorities under the Act shall be embodied in a scheme to be submitted for the prior approval of the central authority before It is put into operation.(4)    I understand from Mr, Hayes Fisher&apos;s memorandum of the5th November (G.T. 2514) that he is willing to exclude from thescope of a Bill for safeguarding health any provision fordomiciliary medical attendance,.    If so, the wording of the Bill,which at present clearly authorises such provision, should be soamended as to make this point clear.    If, however, Mr. Hayes Fisherdesires to Include some provision of this kind under the Bill, Isuggest that It must be limited to cases of emergency as definedby the Rules of the Central Midwives Board, I.e., certain difficultcases of confinement.     This limitation would, I hope, reduce tothe smallest limits the addition to the existing confusion in ourpublic medical services which, the Bill will make.C. ADDISON.
