I circulate to the War Cabinet the attached Memorandum prepared by Sir H. Llewellyn Smith, on the subject of the future status of Equatorial Africa from a commercial and industrial point of view.A,H. STANLEY.Board of Trade,11th January, 1918.
THU FUTURE STATUS 0? EQUATORIAL AFRICA.. (FR(T* A CaHIiuRCIAL fe INDUSTRIAL FOIMT OF VIlM.)The Board of Trade expressed their views as to theeconomic issues involved in the question of the future of theGerman Colonies in Africa in a Memorandum &quot;prepared for the-Committee or Territorial Changes and printed as Appendix F.(page 13) to their Fourth Report dated July 17th, 1917.In view, however, of the great amount of public attentionrecently given to the question, and in particular the pro-posals that have been made for establishing some kind ofinternational control in Equatorial Afrioa the Board of Tradeso far as concerns Equatorial Africa? have re-examined the     &quot;   probleni^with special reference toschemes of this nature.No doubt many people would prefer that the resultof the war should be that tho German African Colonies shouldbe simply annexed, partly by us and partly by Prance, andthat otherwise the status of Equatorial Afrioa should remainunchanged.      But whatever cur personal preferences -may beit is clearly desirable to face the probability that this maynot be the actual settlement arrived at, and to oxplore in goodtime the commercial and politioal consequences of variousalternative arrangements.. The practicability of intermediate solutions ontho basis of restoring part but net all of the German Colonieshas already been sufficiently examined in the Report abovereferred to.ItThe expression is used throurhout in the sense of the -Conv ntion&amp;l Basin of th; Congo&quot;.     It do a not includeGerman South    sx, Africa..
It remains to consider the consequences of a solution along the lines of *?hat is vaguely called &quot;internationalism&quot;, by which is understeed army regime involving a league more or less complete and more or le^s permanent among the European Colonies and Protectorates in Equatorial Africa (or more correctly among the European countries concerned in respect of those CoLnies and Prtectcrates)*      This &quot;international status&apos;&quot; has, already existed in germ in the rdgimo set up for Equatorial Africa by the Berlin and Brussels Acts, and it is conceivable that this regime should be developed up to any point which may be thought safe and desirable, cither with or with/ut the participation of Germany.       The immediate concern of the present Memorandum is with the c. meroial and economic aspects of such an arrangement, but in order to make such an oxaminati n possible it is necessary to consider one or two preliminary matters of a more general character.(1)     In the first plaoe, it is to be cbsnrYod that the question of returning the Gorman Colonies to German control, and the question of conferring a more or less complete inter-national status on some or all parts of the area of Equatorial Africa are not independent alternatives, but require to be studied as parts of the same problem.     If,&quot;for example, the war should end under conditions which make it impossible for us to resist the readmission of Germany to some share of Equatorial Africa, a system cf international safeguards - if a safe and practical form can be devised - may possibly prove the best, or even the only possible means of-guarding against, or cf at least minimising the dangers of suoh readmissisn.
If, on the other hand, Germany be definitely and finally excluded, the question of a league of Equatorial African States becomes purely a question of inter-Allied policy.(2)   In the second place; it should be noted that the term &quot;internationalism&quot; is susceptible to many widely different interpretations.   It may mean a system of joint sovereignty and divided administrative&quot; authority such as broke down so hopelessly in Samoa and the New Hebrides. On the other hand, it may mean (as already hinted) a development of the pre-war system of Treaty guarantees for equal commercial treatment, suppression of slavery, liquor traffic, &amp;c, without impairing the sovereign rights or administrative autonomy of the various colonies within the Conventional area.   Or it may be something intermediate between these two extremes - some league of Equatorial States which, while leaving intact the Sovereign control of the con-tracting Powers over their respective Colonies, may involve the temporary or permanent delegation by those Powers of some degree of control over certain crmmon services (e.g. Customs) to a federal authority created by treaty.In so unprecedented a. situation as that in which we are now placed it is most important not to be bound too rigid]/ by constitutional precedents. (Lord Cromer&apos;s invention of Anglo-Egyptian sovereignty over the Soudan had absolutely no precedent, yet it has proved eminently workable and suitable for its purpose.)   Her should, we assume too readily that the unfortunate but limited experience of certain definite experi-ments in international control is conclusive against the feasibility of any measure of the kind.
We need to examine all available historical cases, whether of failure or of success, of international action with an open mind with a wish to ascertain how far the observed results followed inevitably from conditions inherent in the very nature of international control, or how far they may have been due in each particular case to special and accidental causes, local, personal, or otherwise, of a character which may or may not be present in the case under consideration.   All that can be laid down at present, pending a more thorough investigation, is that, according to all experience, international control is most likely to be a success when it starts from the point of view of a common treaty code regulating, definite matters of common concern, but leaving local administration, so far as possible, intact; and is most likely to.fail when it attempts to set up a -&quot;condominium&quot; implying direct local administrative control through joint or divided agencies. .Certainly it would require very strong reasons indeed to induce us to surrender any part of our sovereignty in Africa to a new &quot;Sovereign&quot; State, but this should not prevent us from examining with an open mind the commercial and economic results of maintaining and developing the international system inaugurated by the Berlin and Brussels Acts.It will simplify the problem to assume provisionally that Germany will at all events at the outset have no share what-over in framing or administering the &quot;International system&quot; in question.    The con sequencer: of her possible future admission to the league will be separately examined Later.
The first and most essential economic feature of any- * league will naturally be a Customs Convention prescribing equalit/ of Customs,treatment and complete commercial freedom within the Conventional area, and equality of treatment in all respects of the trade and shipping of the Contracting States in Equatorial Africa.   Such a system is of course incompatible with any system of &quot;preference&quot; to the products of the other parts of the British Empire imported into Equatorial Africa, and we should therefore have to face the necessity of abandoning or at least postponing indefinitely any idea of applying Imperialpreference of this nature to our Colonies in Equatorial Africa,   v/e should naturally remain free to give in the United Kingdom or in other parts of the Empire any preference we please to the products of British Colonies in Afrioa though no doubt the absence of internal Customs barriers might present practical difficulties.There is nothing new in such a disability which has in fact been a cardinal feature of the treaty regime applic-able to Equatorial Africa.   Up to the present it has not been a matter of any practical moment, and for many years it will probably only have a sentimental importance, since in such markets as those of Central Africa our Traders find no difficulty in holding their own on equal terms, and their desire is not for preference but for the security cf the &quot;open door&quot;.    From a purely British trade point of view it will be of much greater value to us   to secure an &quot;open door&quot; for a period of years in the French, Belgian and Portuguese Colonies (not to mention the German) than to obtain preferen--tial treatment in British Colonies in Equatorial Africa. From a purely commercial standpoint therefore we should wel-come a Conventional regime prescribing the &quot;open door&quot;.This
This provision standing by itself is only a very small step towards International!sation.     A more definite step would be to prescribe not only equal treatment of the commerce of all nations, but equal rates of Customs duties throughout the whole area.A great approach to such a regime was made by the Brussels Declaration of 1890, which placed a limit of 10% on import duties.The practical importance to our trade of identical Customs duties tnroughout all parts of   Equatorial Africa is at present les3 than security for equal treatment in any given part of that area, because the undeveloped character of the country and the want of means of rapid and cheap communication make the imports at different ports largely . non-ccnpetitive.   Still, taking a long view, it will be to tne advantage of our trade in the future to have soourity for equal Customs duties throughout the whole area.     Customs duties in Equatorial Africa will for many years be imposed for revenue and not for protective purposes and it is almost certain that the rates which we should be likely to impose for this purpose in our own Colonies will be lo%cr than those imposed in the Portuguese and probably in the French Colonies.     Hence, a Conventional limit which our Allies would accept would be most unlikely to diminish our revenue below the requirements of our administration, while it would guarantee that the market for British goods in other parts of the area would not be restricted by Cus-toms duties fixed at rates too high for the trade to bear.
The real obstacle to a Customs Union in this sense will not arise from the interests either cf our Colonial administration or of British trade, but from the needs of the more backward Colonial administrations which may not be able to make both ends meet with import duties fixed at (say) 10 per cent.    It seems therefore necessary to contemplate the possibility cf some sort of &quot;equalisation fund&quot; which shall be administered by a common authority.     This leads naturally to the ques-tion of the possibility bf -    a full Customs Unionin the true federal sense, i9e. a Common Customs Board which shall collect as well as fix the duties, and hand over the quota-3 (after deducting for common expenditure)  to the respective local administrations.Such a step would of courec be a real measure of partial -&quot;internationalization&quot;, and it would involve a substantial delegation of administrative authority t.0 an international Board.     But before dismissing it on this account, the advantages and disadvantages whould be carefully weighed.- (l)   Prom a purely trade point of view the International adrndni -tration of Custom? throughout Equatorial Africa would offer the bent possible guarantee that the &quot;open door&quot; secured by treaty shall not be nullified by some secret system of re-bates or privileges,or by corruption of the Custom- officials, All who are familiar with Custom? administration in backward countries, and even in some advanced European countries, know what a formidable amount of discrimination between traders and countries can bo exercised by a Customs administration , which is itself corrupt or unscrupulous or which is under the power of unscrupulous industrial &quot;interests&quot;.    Against all thiv discrimination an International Customs Administration i* the surest safeguard, and if anything like the ImperialMaritime
/Maritime Customs of China could he reproduced for Equatorial Africa we might feel a great added security tha t our trade and shipping will in fact have fair play in future throughout this great area.It would also he desirable in the interests of Shipping that the suggested Customs Board should have control not only of Customs duties on goods but also of port and harbour dues, which should be fixed by international agreement at such rates as will suffice but only suffice for the maintenance and improvement of port works and sanitary administration.(2)    This of course is on the assumption that a really competent impartial and incorruptible Customs administration can be secured, but this surely is not an insuperable difficulty. The precise composition of the supreme Customs Board,  i,e. whether on the purely &quot;Federal&quot; basis of equal representation cf separate Colonies, or on the basis of proportionate in-terests measured by such tests as population,  area or Customs revenue would need careful consideration * especially in view of the suggestions made in later parts of this Memor-andunuThe formation of a common Customs service presents nc special difficulties of a kind which have not already bo- n successfully surmounted in such oas-^-s as the Chines.-Maritime; Customs or the Turkish Ottoman Debt administration.(3)    It will bw noticed that the formation of a Customs Union with a Federal Customs Administration provides a guarantee not only for the fair administration of the commercial policy prescribed in the Convention by ?;hich the Union is created, but also for the obs-rvance of all thu- other stipulations of the Convention, which (on the model of the Berlin Aot) will doubtlessD provide
provide for such matters as the suppression or regulation of the traffic in liquor and arms, the just and humane treatment of natives, respect for tribal customs and laws, especially those relating to land, and the restriction of any armed native or other forces maintained by the various States to the limits necessary for maintaining order and repelling outside aggression.     There would also naturally be provisions forbidding the creation of fortifications or naval or aerial bases, &amp;c, &amp;c.     Some cf these provisions (e.g, those relating to traffic in arms and liquor) would bo directly guaranteed by an International Customs administration, while the customs Authority would hold ample pledges for the observance of the remainder in the shape of control over the bulk of the revenue of the Colonies.It would for example he necessary to set up some arbitral machinery, c.g* the Hague Tribunal, for dealing with questions between States arising under the Convention, and it would be     possible to give this Tribunal the power of awarding damages out of the Customs Revenue.If a satisfactory central Customs Board can be created, it i? worth consideration whether it might not oxerciso wider powers than tho supervision cf the Customs and the Ports, eBgo whether it might not have delegated to it duties with regard to such vitally important economic matters as the granting of Mining and other industrial concessions.     tn these matters British policy has be..n and is likely to remain more liberal than that of our Allies, so that we have more to gain than to lose by the enactment of a common Mining and Concessions Code administered by an impartial authority, upholding native rights and prohibiting any discrimination direct or indireotwith
with regard to the nationality of enterprise, (other than such temporary penalisation of German controlled enterprise as it may be thought possible and desirable to stipulate for in the event of Germany being excluded from all participation in the control).  . Our difficulty here will probably be with our Allies who will not willingly give up thejr exclusive policy of granting concessions to &quot;nationals&quot;.     Possibly in the last resort some kind of priority on equal terms could be reserved for national enterprise within the respective Colonies, but even so there is very much to be said fpr an impartial adminis-tration of the laws with regard to concessions.The question is bound to arise whether the machinery above suggested could and should be used to enforce neutrality on the part of Equatorial Africa in the event of a future war in which two or more of the Contracting States are engaged on opposite sides,     This of course is far more than a commercial question, and its detailed discussion is outside the scope of this memorandum.     It would probably be n- cessary in order to maintain continuity of administration during any such war to provide that in such event tho representatives of belligerent Powers should cease for the time to sit on the Federal Board, but that they might entrust their interests thereon to repre-sentatives of neutral States designated by them for the purpose (perhaps the same neutral States that arc charged by the belligerents with their interests in the- other belligerent country).     Thus, during a war of this kind,,the whole of the common services of Equatorial Africa would be automatically &quot;neutralised&quot;, and the local Customs Officers wculd be directed to see that the obligations of neutrality were fulfilled in respect of ships and goods, and persons attempting to abuse hospitality of the ports.     But to enforce those obligations would no doubt need an armed force, and if perpetual neutralityis
is to bo one of the stipulations of the Convention (as is certain to be strongly pressed for) it would seem to - follow that the Federal Board must have under its command a certain police force independent of an in addition to the armed forces of the separate Colonies.      (The international status of such a force, seeing that the Federal Board would not pre-sumably be a Sovereign Power, would need some consideration.)The question of the status of the German Colonies in any such system depends of course on the terms on which the present war is ended.     All that need be said here is that the system sketched above is elastic enough to adapt itself to either -ilternative, i.e. complete retention or complete return, or to any intermediate solution between them.     If the German Colonies are not returned, the mode of administration of these territories will of course have to be settled.     They might, for example, be merely annexed to the adjacent Colonies, or their administration might be provisionally entrusted to some Neutral State with a &quot;mandate&quot; from the Contracting Powers. But whatever administration be set up it would have to be sub-ject to the fundamental laws enacted in the Convention.If, on the other hand, Germany be eventually readmitted she would have to come in subject to the same international safeguards, and the longer such readmission can be delayed the better, in order that passions may have time to cool, that the risk of vengeance? being taken on tho native population which sid d with the Alii .s may b: minimised, and that th&apos;  new int-r-national control mwy have full time to consolidate itself.In conclusion, it may b- . obs rv-&apos;d that while the present memorandum i? necessarily confined to the bearing of any pro-posod scheme on British commercial interests, the final test11. of
of its dopira&quot;bility ip wh-ther it would or would not conduce to the peaceful development and welfare of the native popu-lationp of this vast and little develop- d region.(Sd.) H. LLEWELLYN SMITH.7.1,18.1 0
