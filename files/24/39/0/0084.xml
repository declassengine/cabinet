AMENDMENT  TO  THE  LABOUR  PARTY DRAFT  CONSTITUTION.&quot; The Conference has considered the proposed new Constitution of the Party, and regards the scheme as unsatisfactory, inasmuch as it is complicated and inconsistent, and perpetuates the anomalies of plural voting and indirect central representation. The Conference believes that the welfare and strength of the Party depends cm its being such as will afford the fairest and most direct representation of the rank and file of the Party, aud therefore remits back the new proposals to the Executive, in order that the Executive may prepare a fresh scheme which will establish the Party on a sound democratic basis in accordance with the principles in --operation in Trade Union, Co-operative and Socialist organisations, and consistent with the democratic principles which the Party seeks to advance in the State. Such a scheme should embody primarily the following provisions : &quot; 1. That the membership of the Party consist of Local Labour Parties composed of local bodies and individuals at present (or in future) eligible to join the Party.&quot; 2.* That the Annual Conference consist of delegates directly appointed by the Local Labour Parties.&quot; 3. That the Executive be elected&apos; at the Annual Conference by the ballot vote of the assembled delegates.&quot; 4. That the funds of the Party be raised by per capita contributions as now, to be paid by the affiliated bodies and individuals through the Local Labour Parties.&quot;Independent Labour Party.&quot; That this Conference instructs the Executive Committee to advise and assist every local political Labour Organisation affiliated to the National Party to broaden its rules (where necessary) so as to provide for the admission (through Ward Committees or otherwise) of individual men and women who are willing to work for the objects and subscribe to the Constitution and Programme of the Party. Further, this Conference resolves to adhere to the existing Constitution of the National Party (except in so far as it may be modified by the adoption of any proposals on the agenda from affiliated organisations), but agrees to the affiliation fees of Trade Unions and Socialist Societies being raised to 2d.- per member per annum, with a minimum of 30s., and hereby authorises the Executive Committee to give effect to that alteration.&quot;The Eailway Clerks&apos; Association.&quot; That before proceeding to the detailed discussion of the new Constitution, a Special Committee be appointed to examine the whole of the suggested amendments and make recommendations thereon for the early consideration of the Conference. The mover of each amendment to be added to this Committee,&quot; -    - -Richmond and District Trades Council.
