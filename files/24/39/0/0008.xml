BOARD OP AGRICULTURE MO). FISHERIES. Report for week ended 9th January, 1918.Small Holdings Colonies.At both the Patrington and Holbeach Colonies the erection of cottagea continues. General repairs are also &quot;being carried out at the former.Steps are being taken to arrange for the cultivation of the land coming in course for spring crops on the Heath Hill (Salop) Colony, the Board no,r* being entitled to enter on such land.Applications for the Directorship of this Colony are under consideration.Ordnance Survey. 94,980 mans were sent to Prance and 4,825 to the Admiralty. -22 relief models were sent to Prance,FISHERIES DIVISION.Administrative Section.There has been an unusual amount of current administrative work and a variety of subjects have been dealt with such, for example, as questions affecting the relations between British and Paroese fishermen, the export of salmon in brine from Hew York, the food supplies allowable to boats leaving for the Stornoway grounds, relaxation of regulations closing fishing grounds, alteration of byelaws, etc.The Treasury have declined to relieve Belgian fishing boats from the payment of income tax payable in respect of their landings at British ports.     It is feared that this may result in the boats leaving for Prance, where they would be tax free.Facilities will be afforded for the insurance of Belgian and   Dutch fishing boats as against war risks when using a Br:.t5.rh port as a fishing base.     A Belgian boat fishing from lo^eecofl must have a British fisherman on board, but it is regretted tha-, fhn Board of Trade do not see their way to allow the British f:\sneriaen in such a case to avail himself of the Government scheme of insurance of his personal effects.The issue of Orders relaxing trawling restrictions on the I.E. and HJ, coasts is under consideration.The Treasury have been asked to sanction a grant of  250 in aid of the repair of Kousehole Harbour.Pexmit^Section.Thirty-six permits have been issued to fishing vessels and thirty-seven cancelled.
With, a 7iw to assisting Gravesend food supplies and the fishermen of the pert, a new area has been opened in the Thamesj in which a limited number of boats may fish.ffisherreg&apos;s Registration and Recruiting Section.The census of the Grimsby fishing industry as apart from the crews of vessels is nearly complete, and the analysis bids fair to be of service,     it has b^en decided to extend this enquiry to oth*r fishing stations, and lists of ports at which it would be of aervice have beon drawn up ^ith the assistance of the Board&apos;s District Inspectors.Mot^qr^ Loan Committee.The most interest ing fact to report this week is the phenomenal way in which repayments nre coming in.Up to the present tirart loans for which all formalities havrt b^n complied with hav^ b*en issued to the extent of about  7,900, thn total pay-^nts nad-3 by fish^rmon to date are about  3,500.S^v^ral loans, one of over  300 have be-^n completely paid off, in others men have paid both principal and interest 3 years in advance.The Committee had expected that there would be a lull in the amount of work to b^ ione during the winter months; this, however, has not oroved to b* the case since, for instance, there are 10 vessels waiting for engines at Brighton, while the mechanics havp -ore work than they can cope with in other parts of the country.A Brixham Dandy, one of the largest in tho port which has lately been engined by the Committee, on h*r travlin^ trials cleared  50.    A smaller B^ixh.im vessel, also engined by the Cormittee, in one week cleared more than three times as much aa th^ b-^st sailing v^ss^l in the port.Th&quot; Pool^ motor-boats havrt b*en consistently landing lar^ catch^g of sprats and cominto port some four or five hours b^for^ the sailing vessels.^y^sh JfoterPish.The Committee have issued a circular asking for particulars relating to waters containing or likely to be suitable for the cultivation of eels.The normal work of the Board proceeds on lines previously indicated.Secretary.h January, 1918.
