The Director General.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)16th January, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 15th January:-The Weather.Last weekfs weather was bad for farm work, heavy snowfalls and frost being general in the early part of the week.     As much as 24 degrees of frost were registered in the Peterborough district, and in Yorkshire the weather was as bad as any yet experienced this winter, roads being blocked in many places by snow drifts.     In the middle of the week there was a heavy thaw, and subsequently there was a small amount of ploughing on the lighter land in some of the counties.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. Buckinghamshire - At the request of the Executive Committee the Headmaster of Eton has consented to plough up 50 acres of Agar&apos;s Plough.     The Department have sanctioned the taking possession of 30 acres of common land at Eton Wick, which will be let to a tenant who has undertaken to provide an equivalent pasture in the autumn.Cambridgeshire - The Committee have ordered 82 acres of a private training ground near Newmarket to be broken up. Cumberland.- The Committee have arranged with the War Office Land Agent for the cropping of 250 acres of Government land at
Gretna and. Longtowm.Devonshire - The Committee have taken possession of a farm of 111 acres near Bideford which was in the occupation of the owner who lives at a distance and had neglected it so that the buildings are in ruins.     The farm will be let to adjoining owner s.Huntingdonshire - The Committee have taken possession of a farm (acreage not stated) on the Duchy of Manchester settled estate which had been left vacant since Michaelmas in view of the intended sale of the estate.     Such of the lands as are available for wheat have been sown by the Committee who propose to cultivate the farm themselves.Sussex, West - A scheme has been framed for the cultivation by the Committee of 717 acres on the Coolhurst Estata in St. Leonard&apos;s Forest, and the Committee have been authorised to take possession for the purpose of carrying out the scheme.     This estate had long been gravely neglected by the owner, but it is hoped to secure about 200 acres of spring oats.      It is proposed to establish upon this estate a school for ploughmen which is much needed in the county.     The Committee have also been authorised to take possession of a farm of 160 acres with 100 acres arable near Shipley, which was very foul;   the farm is let to the present tenant for 21 years, of which 13 years are unexpired.-MontgomeryshireThe Executive Committee have succeeded after much negotiation in making arrangements with the owner for the cultivation of the lellington Hall Estate, which comprises 12 farms containing in all about 1,000 acres.     Nearly the whole of the land was going out of cultivation owing chiefly to . &apos;. . difficulties which had arisen between the owner and his tenants. One farm of 200 acres will be left for cultivation by the owner;
and the eleven other farms will be let to tenants approved by the Committee at rents suggested by them, for terms of not less than 5 years unless any tenant shall prefer a yearly tenancy.Golf Clubs - In Cambridgeshire the Committee propose to take possession and to cultivate for spring corn 100 acres of the Gogmagog golf course.     In Kent the Committee have been authorised to take possession of 28 acres of the Westgate Course for cultivation.   The Leicester golf club have arranged for the feeding of cattle on their course so as to allow a neighbouring farmer to plough up 50 acres of land,     In Oxfordshire there are only three golf clubs with land suitable for ploughing up, and they have agreed that portions of their courses shall be cultivated.Offences against the Regulations - In East Suffolk Sir Ralph Blois has been fined  60 and costs on two summonses for failing to comply with notices to cultivate a farm which was unlet and a piece of land in his own occupation.     The Committee have taken possession of the unlet farm as stated in the weekly report for 28th November, 1917.     In Devonshire a land speculator who had allowed two farms near Honiton to become derelict has been fined  35 and 20 guineas costs on two summonses for non-compliance with orders of the Agricultural Executive Committee. Unfortunately for technical reasons, the only orders in respect of which it was found possible to prosecute were somewhat trivial;   otherwise the sentence might have been more exemplary.Drainage - The Buckinghamshire Agricultural Executive Committee are serving notices to secure the cleansing of the Colne Brook. Damage by Game - Action under the Rabbits Order is reported
from Bedfordshire (Everton Estate), Sssex, Somerset, Surrey, and Warwickshire.Cultivation of Lands Order. 1918. - Additions having recently &quot;been made to Regulation 2M to enable the Board to provide accommodation for labour, machinery and stock, to secure the repair of hedges and fences and of field drains, to make general orders prohibiting the growth of special crops, to obtain additional returns of cultivation and stook and so on, the opportunity has been taken to make a new Cultivation of &quot;Lands Order, revoking fchat already in force with regard to agricultural land as well as the Drainage of Lands Orders, so that the whole of the powers of Agricultural Executive Commit-tees to ensure the cultivation and drainage of land will be found in one Order.   The powers to issue general orders as to crops and to call for returns have not been delegated to the Committees.   The penalty provisions of Regulation 2M are csn-siderably enlarged by the recent Order in Council. Determination of Tenancies - During the week 13 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 350 acres, and 8 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 500 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Economy in the Use of Vegetable Seeds.   With the view of securing economy in the use of vegetable seeds, special efforts have been made to bring the pamphlets and leaflets dealing with the subject to the notice of cultivators and already 530,000 copies have been distributed.Fruit Bottling, Drying etc.   Arrangements have been made for a series of exhibitions to be held in different parts of the country, and during the past week, 29 lectures and demonstrations have been given,Basket Making.. An Instructor has been obtained for a centre which it is proposed to start at Otford, Kent under the auspices of the
Womens&apos; Agricultural Committee.   At Evesham, the Svesham LlarketGardeners&apos; Assoeiation are prepared to start basket making, andwill employ partly disabled soldiers for the purpose if theycan be secured.The services of a basket making instructor have beensupplied by the Department&apos;for the Cheltenham Market Gardeners&apos;Association, and a basket making shop is to be started with locallabour as a part of the Co-operative Society of the Association.Potato Spraying,   A conference with local organisations hasbeen held at Winchester and similar conferences are being arrangedin Wilts and Dorset.   The assistance of the&quot;Clergy is beinggenerously given in connection with the spraying campaign, andletters have been received from the Archbishop of Canterbury andfrom the Archbishop of Westminster urging upon the Clergy thevalue of this work.Provision of Land for Allotments.   Reports received by the Depart-ment show that in 1,104 districts 216,154 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, and 196,093 plots have been provided, containing a total area of 14,331. acres.As the result of visits made during the past week by the Inspectors of the Allotments&quot; Section, 107 acres of land, not Included in the above total acreage, have been or are about to be aoquired for the purpose of providing 1,500 new allotments in the following places:-Acres...

At Shildon it is estimated that tho number of allotment holders in the present year will be 1,500 out of a total of 3,000 householders, and at Aspatria, 650 of the. 700 householders will either be cultivating an allotment or a garden.At Frinton-on-Sea, where land is available, the local authorities have undertaken to make a house to house appeal in order to secure the cultivation of the land.   The Departments Inspector has recommended the County Borough of West Ham- to acquire. 27^ additional acres for sub-division into 400 allotments.TECHNICAL- DIVISION. &apos; - &apos;Seedi Testing Station.   Now that the Station is fully equipped and staffed, within&apos;the limits of the present accommodation, it-may be desirable to report rather more fully on the.work under-taken.   Although the demands on the station .have been very con-siderably in excess of expectations, the emergency measures taken to cope with the rush of samples have been so far successful that the testing of cereal seeds (to which special importance is -attached) ie;&apos;commenced as soon as they are received, and. as- -:... - .   -if&apos;-&apos;      . -regards other seeds the station is not more than 5 or 6 days, behindhand.   The present capacity of the station allows ..of -ger-mination tests on about 900 samples (i.e. 3,600 &quot;sets&quot;) running concurrently, and at the present time 733 samples are actually in the incubators, while purity tests are in hand on another large batch of samples.   The total number of samples received up to date is 2,172, and reports have-already been sent out in
respect of nearly half this number.   During the past week, samples have come in at the rate of over 80 a day.   Since the station was opened, fees amounting to upwards of  300 (including deposit accounts ) have been received.Bracken as a source of Potash.   A series of experiments made at the Department^ request jointly by the Rothamsted Experimental Station, the Glasgow and West of Scotland Agricultural College, the University College of North Wales, and in part at Long Ashton, into the amount of potash obtainable from bracken ash, is now concluded.   It is shown that the amount of potash in bracken depends on the stage of growth of the plant.   Thus the ash of the young shoots collected in May or early June contains as much as 50-56$ of potash (reckoned as KgO), but this proportion steadily falls off as the plant grows older, till in full-grown bracken the potash content of the ash may be below 30$.   The young shoots may yield about 20 lbs. of potash per acre; the old ones 200 lbs. or more.   The bracken that has lain out through the winter becomes very poor In potash and may contain only 2%. Assuming the potash to be worth 10/- per unit, the ash of the fully-grown plant collected (under ideal conditions) in July or August should be worth about  15- 20 per ton, and a ton of ash might be expected from about 4 to 8 acres of bracken.   It is concluded that the best way of utilising bracken is to use it as litter, but failing that it could be burnt.Methods of utilising Liquid Manure.   In view of the prospective shortage of quick acting nitrogenous fertilisers, it has become even more necessary than before to find means of avoiding loss of liquid manure, especially on dairy farms where considerable-quantities of cake are fed.   Investigations have, therefore, been put in hand:-   (1) to ascertain the best methods of storage in tanks, where these are available; (2) to study the possibility of absorbing the fertilising constituents from the liquid manure by some cheap material.   The latter method would be used where
there are no tanks.   Two types Of material are under investiga-tion:-   (a) those capable of entering into chemical reactions with the fertilising constituents of the liquid manure, e.g. burnt magnesian limestone, basic slag, ete.;    (b) those possessing high powers of physical absorption, e.g. peat, earth, straw, charred sawdust, etc.   In order to eliminate bacterial action in these physical absorptions, some of the experiments are being carried out in the presence of nitre-cake used as an antiseptic. Inspection of Land.   A dairy farm of 140 acres, at Southgate, near London, maintaining a fine herd of about 60 pedigree Jersey cattle, half of which are cows and heifers in milk, was inspected by two of the Advisory Officers.   Up to 1917 all the land was under grass, but last April a field of 8 acres was ploughed, and the owner has now been ordered to plough an additional 12 acres. Suggestions have been made for the cropping of the land, and if the Executive Committee agree to the proposals, the farm would provide a valuable demonstration of arable dairy farming in a suburban area.LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier Labour.   The total number of ploughmen who have arrived from overseas on two months1 agricultural furlough is now 1,393. Of these 158 are out in charge of Government horses, and the remainder, except for a few men sick or at the ploughing schools, are out with farmers on ploughing work.Exclusive of the men above-mentioned, 32,216 soldiers have been attached to Depots to date for the 1918 programme, of whom 22,445 are classed as skilled and 9,771 as unskilled.   The number of these men actually out on farms is 20,657 so-called &quot;skilled&quot; and 6,721 unskilled.An additional 136 men have been sent out for training as tractor drivers during the week, making a total to date of 2,288 men.
The Department were informed during the week by the Ministry of National Service that 11 soldiers of the South African Forces were available for a time for agricultural work and. these men were immediately placed.Horses - Orders for the issue of 212 additional horses have been sent out, making a total of 5,030 horses to date. Prisoners of War - Four additional agricultural prisoner camps were opened during the week, bringing the total number of agricultural camps up.to 36, comprising a total of 3,637 prisoners. In addition 1,008 combatant prisoners are employed from parent camps, and 1,463 interned aliens have been released for employment in agriculture.     The total number of prisoners engaged on agricultural work at present is, therefore, 6,108.     One additional scheme for the employment of prisoners on general agricultural work has been sent to the War Office, making the total additional prisoners now applied for up to 1,892,In connection with the prisoner ploughmen who are to be made available for agricultural work, 82 schemes for the employment of these men have now been sent to the War Office,Information has been received as regards 14 of the schemes that the premises have been approved and will be got ready for the reception of the men at the earliest possible date.Women&apos;s Branch, The arrangements between this Department, the Forage Committee of the War Office, and the Timber Supply Department of the Board of Trade, whereby women required for the work of the three Departments will be recruited into one Land Army are now complete, and a memorandum fully explaining the scheme, to-gether with the revised enrolment form and terms of service, are in the hands of the County Committees and the officials of the
Employment Exchanges of the Ministry of Labour in co-operation with whom the scheme has been evolved.The greatest difficulty appears to be that the two sections other than agriculture are able to offer greater advantages as regards rate of pay, the women in these classes being employed and paid by the Government.   This Department has been able to help both the Timber Supply Department, and the Forage Committee in the matter of outfits, the latter having had great difficulty with their supplies.   The Timber Supply Department only requires a comparatively small number and the Womenfs Branch has undertaken, therefores to supply their iteeds.Women are now employed on motor tractors in Buckinghamshire, Cheshire, Hampshire, Kent, Lancashire, Oxfordshire, and Wiltshire.   Twelve women have been placed during the past week and the vacancies in the training centres are being filled without delay.MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION. The following statement shows the position as regards the provision of tractors owned by the Department:-Consigned to Tractor Schools up toand including 8th January ...      ... ... 1,945Consigning instructions given duringthe week     ....      ...           ...      ... ... 44On offer to counties              ...      ... ... 20Consigned to Scotland....... ... 12711        &quot; Ireland ...     ... ...     _822,218While the weather during the past week has been unfavourable for tractor ploughing in the great majority of counties, it is reported from North Devon that the total aereage ploughed in the Division constitutes a record, being 28.5 aares more than the previous highest week.   The average per tractor shows an advance of 2.4 acres, and the paraffin consumption (5.2 gallons per acre) is the lowest on record for this county.
Many counties are stimulating the Tractor Teams by offering rewards for good work, and the effect will, no doubt,&quot;be increasingly reflected in future returns.y ; - .-. /.&apos;/ .&apos;.;v.--.., &apos;-&apos;:&apos;)y&apos;\--&apos;;-&apos;,Y.    &apos;&apos; &apos;i &apos; - ViV&apos;-1::- ,&apos; -   &apos; v&apos; &apos;.&apos;!&apos;!       &apos;! .\&apos;!&apos;.v.v v.v.        &apos;&apos;:. .&apos; &apos; - - t v&apos;  &apos;.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Supplies Sui)-Commi11ees.     Fifteen counties have been visited since the beginning of the year, and representatives of the Supplies Sub-Committees have been interviewed.   Generally speaking, the position appears to be fairly satisfactory, though there are numerous complaints as to the difficulty in obtaining basic slag. The demand for fertilisers is undoubtedly very keen, and farmers are evidently ordering appreoiab3.y greater quantities than In previous years.Sulphate of Ammonia.   The whole output of sulphate of ammonia up to the 31st of May next has been sold by the makers either to merchants or direct to farmers, with the exception of the comparatively small amounts sold locally by gas works.   The. Approved Agents have, therefore, been informed that the Sulphate.of Ammonia Distribution Committee cannot accept any further orders. Although the output has been sold, farmers will still be able to obtain supplies from dealers, as the whole of the production between now and the 31st May remains to be delivered, together with the stocks in the hands of Approved Agents and others.The quantity of sulphate of ammonia delivered for agricultural use during December was 23,500 tons as against about 6,700 tons in the same month in the previous year.   Production is being well maintained.   A satisfactory feature is that delivery from the works is proceeding regularly and that the stocks in the hands of makers are small.Superphosphate.   The production of superphosphate in December was 50,000 tons.   Several of the wcrks are short of labour, and a good deal of difficulty is being experienced by the Ministry of Munitions in meeting their demands-
Basic Slag.   The production for the four weeks ending the 29th December was a little over 32,000 tons, which was slightly below the average owing to the Christmas holidays.   Deliveries in the same period were 36,000 tons, and stocks at works were reduced from 16,000 to 12,000 tons.   Stocks on hand are comparatively small, only two out of a total of 26 works having any substantial supply. Lime.    The employment of German prisoners in lime works has proved satisfactory in a number of instances.    In one works where 10 prisoners are employed the weekly output has been raised from 97 to 390 tons, and very similar results have been obtained in another instance.Stable^ Manure.   Satisfactory progress continues to be made with the removal of the stable manure from the Eelmoor dump near Aldershot. Orders have been received for over 11,000 tons.   The War Office have now given authority for the purchase of 20 barges in all, with which it is hoped it will be possible to move about 1,200 tons a week.     The manure is at present being distributed at dumps along the Basingstoke Canal between Aldershot and Weybridge, but it is proposed in the course pf a few weeks to extend the distribution in the direction of Basingstoke.Seed Wheat.    The total quantity of wheat shipped to Prance amounts to 16,289 quarters, and the amount remaining in store to about 500 quarters.. Seed Oats.Oats - from the Isle of Man.     Samples of these oats have now been distributed to Storage Agents and- selected Approved Agents in the various counties, and a circular letter has been issued giving particulars of the method of procedure to be followed in obtaining supplies, together with particulars of prices.   The oats are being offered at a price not exceeding 65/- per quarter of 336 lbs., in returnable bags.   The latest reports indicate that many of the parcels coming forward from the Isle of Man are not likely to be suitable for seed.
(2)   Irish Oats.   The first cargo of Irish oats, which will consist of about 700 tons, is now being loaded.   Every effort will be made to distribute samples as soon as the cargo arrives, and a further circular letter will be issued to Agents regarding prices.No prohibition has yet been introduced on the export of oats from Ireland on private account.    Latest advices indicate that the total amount of seed oats available will be less than 20^000 tons, the figure first mentioned,(3)   Scottish Oats.   Negotiations are still pending with the Scottish Board regarding the proposed prohibition of the export of oats from Scotland on private account, and as to the methods to be followed in securing seed for English farmers.       This matter is being pressed by the Department.Seed Potatoes.   During the week ending the 12th January, 1,883 tons of seed potatoes were ordered and 153 tons were delivered from Scotland.   Out of the total of 17,000 tons already ordered, delivery instructions have been given for 4,251 tons and the total quantity delivered is 250 tons.Owing to the severe weather which has prevailed since the beginning of the year, several consignments of seed potatoes have suffered from frost in transit.   These cases are being investigated with a view to ascertaining the extent of the damage and the condition in which the potatoes were loaded.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
