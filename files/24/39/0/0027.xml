SECRET.Copy No.   170.1/155/388.   (T!-,&apos;-s 3ocument IS. 1.18.1wv^ / 7      American Battalions for British Divisions.    xjk4&amp;The war Cabinet will wish to know the result of my interview with General Pershing..    Apparently he had never seriously considered the proposal sent to Colonel House by the Prime Minister, although Colonel House had shown him the memorandumjon the subject.   The fact is, he does not like the proposal because,  (a) he is anxious to bring over his divisions, as such;  (b) he naturally prefers to preserve national identity and argues, quite rightly, that American battalions cannot be expected to do as well in British as in American divisions.   The result of the interview was that he will forward our proposal to his Government, giving it a mild form of support and telegraphing me a copy of the communication he sends.     I hope to receive this in two or three days1 time.     He wished to defer the despatch of the telegram to Washington until he had seen General Petain yesterday, as the French had made to him a proposal similar to ours.       As to this, M, Clemenceau told me he had no personal feelings in the matter, and was quite prepared to see-the Americans corae to us if they would but cone to somebody.   I have reason to think that General Petain will take the same line.General Pershing pressed, as I knew he would, for us to use any additional tonnage we can spare for the transport of American divisions instead of infantry reinforcements for our own divisions, and I. had repeatedly to remind him that whereas the tonnage we can find will bring over some 150,000 to 200,000infantryis
infantry (say 150 battalions) who can be fighting in 3 or 4 months, it cannot bring over more than about 3 divisions (36 battalions), who will not be fighting for at least 6 months.     Eventually he admitted the force of this argument.     I addod that the British Oove-m-ment could not, for the sake of these 3 divisions, run the great risks incurred in cuttInn; down our stocks of food and war material in order to provide the special tonnage, though they would do so for the sake of the infantry reinforcements.He made another alternative proposal - that instead of putting American battalions into our brigades we should take out all infantry from a certain number of our divisions, and he would put into the latter entirely American infantry.     To this I replied that as the change v,rould probably have to be made in the early summer it might not be feasible as we may expect to be fighting hard, then; that the change v/ould mean that the divisions concerned would be out of action for several weeks, that is while the newly constructed divisions are settling down, and that the divisions would still remain partly American and partly British.     He finally gave up this proposal also.I impressed upon him the vital necessity of getting additional men over, or American assistance might arrive too late.     I ascertained that there are 45 divisions in course of formation, of which 4 and a bit are now in   Kthese 45, and also said they contain all the battalionsFrance,is very averse from breaking up any ofat
at present raised.   I asked how many divisions he could bring to Prance by*midsummer.   He replied that no one In the world could even guess, as it depends upon the amount of shipping, rate of turning round ships      ^. (which appears to be very slow), equipment etc. etc     !-V\ On being further pressed he said that he hoped, as a maximum, for 15 divisions by the end of June,    How many by the end of the year he declined to estimate, but he agreed that the total would not exceed 30, thus leaving 15 in America,,    I pointed out the danger and uselessness of these 15 remaining idle till 1919, and told him that we, in forming our New Armies, had had to break up two out of six in order to send battalions, as such, to France in 1915, without which we could not have held our own as we did*Finally, he made his chief objection that of national sentiment, and to that I could give no reply except that while we fully appreciated the American point of view, it was a question of sentiment versus the possibility of our divisions becoming so exhausted and attenuated by this year/s fighting as to be of comparatively little use afterwards, in which case it might be difficult for the Entente to win the war,in the way they must win it if their aims are to be realised,   He admitted all this, and said that but for American feeling - which is very strong -to keep their men together and to produce a big Army of their own, he would not hesitate to accept our proposal, but that in the circumstances he could not take the responsibility and must refer to Washington, notwithstanding the telegram he had already received.  (Copy attached for reference)o
I nave never been very sanguine as to American assistance in any form this year, and I must tell the War Cabinet that I have returned still less sanguine. The raising of new armies is a tremendous task for any country, and although one might expect that America, -with her two previous experiences, and her supposed great business and hustling qualities, would do better than other countries, the fact is she is doing very badly.   She had, of course, very little to work upon in the way of cadres and officers;    she has never made any real study of war organization;    and there is no adequate decentralization.   The French have lost all patience, and their relations with the Americans are the reverse of good.   The French are always much too optimistic in such matters, but they may well be ,excused for being dissatisfied in the present case. The Americans are proceeding as if they had years in which to prepare.   They have laid out cantonment areas for 10 divisions, and are building the most luxurious huts to supplement billets;    each man has a bed and 3 blankets;   there are no fewer than 300 officers and 750 typists at their G.H.Q.;    they have as yet little or no rolling stock In the country (though they were to . supply their own) and are using ours which we want for ourselves and for Italy;   they appear to have omitted to take the most elementary steps to speed up disembark-ation at Brest where the big liners go;    and General Pershing tells me that ships are sometimes laid up for days in American ports for want of coal,   He, himself, is charged with all matters connected with the Army in France, such as contracts for aircraft, provision ofmunitions

In fact he is doing in France all the work done by all our different departments in London, with the exception of Finance and Foreign Office work.     There ought to be in France American representatives, other than him, to deal with questions of administration and supply, thus leaving him free to train and fight his troops. Isuggested this to him and he quite agreed, and told me that he hopes to ;ishove off11 some of his work on to General Bliss, who is being sent to Versailles (as an excuse, I understand, for moving him out of his present appointment). General Pershing is lookingolder and rather tired, and I doubt if he yet has an intelligent and considered viev of the nature of his task, or how to set about it.My general impression is that America^ power to help us to win the war - that is to help us to defeat the Germans in battle - is a very weak reed to lean upon at present, and will continue to be so for a very long time to come unless she follows up her words with actions much more practical and energetic than any she has yet taken.
SECRET.DECYPHER of telegram from Sir C. Spring-Rice (Washington).20th December, 1917.PERSONAL.My telegram of December 18*Following is a paraphrase of the telegram sent to Fershing on December 18 by the Secretary of War. which the Secretary of Stats has communicated to me for transmission&quot;President has been urged by both the British and French to accede to their desire to have year forces amalgamated with theirs by regiments and companies: both express the belief that a heavy drive by the Germany is impending somewhere on the line of the Western Front.   While the loss of identity of our forces is not (? desired), we regard that as secondary to the meeting of any critical situation by the use of the troops at your command in the most helpful manner possiblec   Where the drive or drives of the enemy will take place t it is of course diffi** cult to determine?     Any redistribution of your forces would be difficult in advance of some knowledge of that question.   How-eve r the President desires to accord you full authority to use the forces under your command as you may deem wise, after con** sultation with the Commanders-in-Chief of the French and British Forces o&quot;For your consideration it is suggested that it might possibly be well to select places for your forces nearer the junction of British and French lines, in order that you might be in a position to throw your strength in whatever direction it might be most needed.,    It is not the purpose of the President to press this suggestion beyond whatever merit it has in your judgment: his sole purpose is to acquaint you with the representations ?/hich have been made here and to grant you en-tire freedom of action in making the best possible use and dis-position of your forces to accomplish the main purpose in view.&quot;By your Conferences with the British and French Commanders it is hoped&apos; that complete unity and co-ordination of action can be secured in this matter.,&quot;Please keep me informed of the result of any Conferences you may have with the French and British Commanders, and of the line of action on which you may agreeB&quot;
