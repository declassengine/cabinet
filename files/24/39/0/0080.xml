Iw?CL I CtoloBe! Joneg- r 3 - *. 358C A P X Lfl T-PROPOSED   TAIIK  iSLHSS. ?Q^Sr-t by Sir ^ g.T.d^yycourt or Fpto, to -mmmMmiH i^f^uii. jSqq also g.j.. 94o).&apos;7ith refcrenco to the Ho to of the 23th ultimo by tho General Staff upon my memo, on Tanks dated the 10th ult., I note that the opinion expressed is generally in agreement with my proposals.In paragraph 1 the necessity for a lighter typo of Tank is referred to.   As regards this, the new Standard. Tank design will be much faster than those used hitherto, and except for the disa-bility of greater weight, which may prevent their crossing light bridges, they will/rT^b^liT5vi^sha.ve,j in addition to the advantages of the Heavy, all the qualities-required in a-Light Tank, though requiring r,bout double the crew.As regards paragraph 2 the question of the exact equivalent number of infantry to oho Tank is not really material.   It is ad-nitted that one Tank is equal to a very largo number.I quite agree that tho Tanks will be useful in defence as well as in attack, and this has already been proved, but the use of Tanks on tho defensive belongs rather to the question of minor tactics; and the point I wisnod to emphasise m recotxiending the Tank Armies was that, if possible, we should have an efficient striking force consisting of two or three Tank Armies, which could be hurled suddenly at one or other points of the Front, and so bring about a victory.   These Armies, as recommended, should if possible be in addition to the ordinary number of Tanks used for defensive and minor offensive operations: the general idea of Tank Armies being strategical rather than tactical.If we have such striking forces available, the enemy will nave to keep large forces moro or less evenly distributed along their line, on tne defence, to be ready for any attack which may occur at any part of their lino, and it would go a long my to preventing ohom massing their forces against us at any particular jooint for a great offensive, since wita a comparatively&apos;small Tank xirmy we should be able to move our striking force to any particular point more quickly, and with greater effect than the enemy can with-out Tanks.As suggested in the Note of the General Staff the French and Americans tould collaborate with us, end possibly one Tank Amy could bo British, one Frenoh, and one American, if this were tnought feasible.Possibly such operations as indicated cannot materialise for many months.   In the meantime nrobably the best tactics will bo to use the Tanks wherever possible along the Front for minor offensives with limited objectives, continually harassing the enemy, but not allowing the Tanks to go too far.These tactics will involve a large number of Tanks and great wastage; and the major operations with Tank Armies will require the further additional Tanks su^ested in my first Memo.Viewing
