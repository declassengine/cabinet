rMonel JonesI circulate to the Cabinet a note by the Timber Controller on the Memorandum on Forestry Administration drawn up by Lord Lovat and other gentlemen.   I concurMemorandum drawn up for the Iar-i2aMiifitJby-JiOrd Lovat, Major G-.L,OourthopeT Sir Andrew ..j\gnew and Sir John Stirling M&amp;SEaLUI have gone very carefully into this matter so far as I can and&quot;&quot;have studied the report of the Forestry Sub-Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction.    It appears to me from what I can gather that the suggestions recom-mended in the attached Memorandum-would put the matter on a better footing than has obtained in&quot;the past.So far as I can understand the position, the arrange-ments which have hitherto been in force have been allowed to drift&apos;through there not being one central body with sufficient authority to keep things up to the&quot;&apos;   mark and it appears at the present time to be drifting in the same way.It doos seem that the present conditions brought about by the War could, if properly handled, lead m the future to permanent -benefit to the country, and would in my -judgment, in a great measure retain a large proportion of the Timber Supplies required for the lining industry and other purposes.I am in full agreement-with-the Memorandum attached which has been drawn ue by Lord Lovat, Major G-.L. Court hope, Sir Andrew Agnew and Sir John Stirling Maxwell.in Mr. Ball!s note.16th January, 1918.A.H* STANLEY.miMSLJMMmmQLLJ.B.BALL14/1/18.
