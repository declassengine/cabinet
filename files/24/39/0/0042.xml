To the Right Hon. D. LLOYD GEORGE, M.P., Trime Minister.Sir,The Committee Las held 31 sittings. We have not found it necessary to examine witnesses. Large quantities of material were available, with regard to the position before the war, In reports of the Royal Commission and the five Government Committees which have investigated forestry questions, and in transactions of societies interested in forestry. With regard to the effect of the war on the forestry position, the facts were either within the knowledge of members of the Committee or were obtainable from Government Departments without taking evidence. Members of the Committee have, however, discussed matters which arose in the course of our work with certain members of the Surveyors&apos; Institution and with representatives of the Royal Institute of British Architects ; and memoranda have been asked for and received from the Royal English and the Royal Scottish Arboricultural Societies, the Hon. Secretary of the English Forestry Association, and the Scots Landowners&apos; Co-operative Forestry Society. These memoranda, which present policies largely in accord with that advocated by the Committee, are printed in the Appendices to this Report^&quot; The Committee desires to express its gratitude to the individuals and societies for valuable help.The interim report, submitted on November 21st, 1916, dealt with the principles and procedure of land acquisition. We were not able - to reach definite conclusions upon these questions, which seemed to require settlement, not in respect of forestry alone, but with regard to all land which might have to be acquired for national purposes. We therefore recommended the setting up of a special body to enquire into land acquisition problems, and made certain suggestions for its consideration, both with regard to the body which should adjudicate in cases of compulsory acquisition, and with regard to the procedure to be followed. We understand that our main recommendation is about to be carried out by the appointment of a special Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee, and we therefore consider it unnecessary to refer further to the subject in this report.The following is a suinmary of our main conclusions : Summary of Report.(1) The total area under woodland in the United Kingdom before the war was estimated at three million acres, the annual yield from which is believed to have been forty-five million cubic feet, or about one-third of what it should have been under correct silvicultural management. These figures indicate the unsatisfactory condition of British and Irish woods as at present managed, and prove the urgency of remedial measures in the interests of national economy.(2) During the five years preceding the war the average annual imports of timber similar in character to that produced in the British Isles were equivalent to five hundred and fifty million cubic feet of standing timber. The home production was therefore less than eight per cent, of the consumption. The imports of timbers of all kinds during the years 1915 and 1916 were respectively three-quarters and two-thirds of the normal pre-war imports, and their cost for the two years was seventy-four million pounds, or thirty-seven millions in excess of their pre-war value. These imports absorbed seven million net tons of shipping, equivalent to approximately fourteen million tons dead weight.^ (3) The area of land utilised for rough grazing, but capable of growing first-class coniferous timber of the same character as that imported, is not less than three and probably more than five million acres. Two million acres could be devoted to timber production without decreasing the home production of meat by more than 0-7 per cent., and if so used would ultimately afford employment to at least ten times the number of men now engaged on that area.(4) Dependence on imported timber has proved a serious handicap in the conduct of the war. The United Kingdom cannot run the risk of future wars without safe-guarding its supplies of timber as every other Power that counts has already done.(5) In order to render the United Kingdom independent of imported timber for three years in an emergency, it is necessary, while making due allowance for an improved yield from existing woods, to afforest 1,770,000 acres. . Taking 80 years as the average rotation, we advise that two thirds of the whole should be planted in the* Appendix I., p. 76.
first 40 years. We consider that the quota to be planted in the first 10 years should, in view of the initial difficulties, be limited to 200,000 acres, of which we advise 150,000 acres should be planted by the State and 50,000 acres by public bodies and private individuals assisted by grants, or by co-operation between them and the State. The area to be planted by the State in subsequent years may be reduced in the same degree, as private individuals come forward to undertake the work.(6) It is net proposed to plant arable land, but a limited area of arable land should be acquired with the forest sites, wherever possible, in order to provide small holdings for forest workers. Our proposals carry with them the important contingent advantage that they will cause large areas of the United Kingdom, now almost waste, to be put to their best economic use. They will also, if provision is made in time, afford the means for settling discharged soldiers on the land under healthy conditions.(7) Forestry demands long views, but the first fruits are not so long delayed as many imagine. The policy of State afforestation which we recommend will begin to provide pitwood, from the quicker-growing species on the better kinds of mountain land, from the 15th year onwards; by the 40th year the plantations made in the first ten years alone will contain sufficient timber to keep our pits supplied, in emergency, for two years on the scale of present consumption.(8) The first essential is a Forest Authority equipped with funds and powers to survey, purchase, lease and plant land and generally to administer the areas acquired, with compulsory powers to be exercised, when needed, after due enquiry and the award of.fair compensation. The care of forestry, now divided among several departments, should be centralised in this body.(9) We recommend that the Authority should be authorised to make limited grants for every acre replanted or newly afforested during the first 10 years after the war by public bodies or private individuals ; such plantations to be made in accordance with approved plans and conditions.(10) We estimate the cost for the first 10 years at 3,425,0001. It may be necessary to invest 15,000,000^. altogether in this enterprise during the first 40 years. After that time the scheme should be self-supporting. The financial return depends on prices, wages, bank rates, &amp;c, which are difficult to forecast. Forests are a national necessity; the country must have them even though they yield less than the current rate of interest on the capital invested. The whole smn involved is less than half the direct loss incurred during the years 1915 and 1916 through dependence on imported timber.(11) The above proposals are framed in the interest of national safety, which requires that more timber should be grown in the British Isles. There remains a further question. The United Kingdom derives more than half its imported timber from virgin forests in foreign countries, which are steadily being depleted. Canada contains the only large reserves within the Empire. Unless arrangements can be made with the Dominion Government for the effectual conservation of these reserves, it is inevitable that provision should be made within the British Isles on a far larger scale than is here proposed for purposes of defence. We consider that this question should be taken up at once with the Dominion Government.If the Government should desire to employ the maximum number of men discharged from the Services on forestry work during the period of demobilisation, the rate of planting may be greatly speeded up, provided the Central Authority is appointed at once, and charged with the duty of preparing schemes complete in every detail in readiness for demobilisation. In that case the area which could be planted within the first five years would only be limited by the number of British-trained officers who could be obtained for the preparation of working plans, by the supply of plants, the area available for planting by the State, and by the willingness of private owners to co-operate. Plans of mutual advantage to afforestation and demobilisation could be worked out without unduly interfering with our scheme as a whole (though the estimate of expenditure for the first ten years would require revision).. They depend, however, on the demobilisation policy of the Government, and it does not fall within the present terms of the reference to the Committee to prepare them. We are, however, as we have explained in the covering letter to our Report, prepared to work out the best methods to be adopted if we are instructed to do so, and receive guidance as to what the requirements of demobilisation will be.
PART I.   THE PRESENT POSITION.I. POSITION OF FORESTRY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.        ;;:1. Historical Note.In order.to obtain a clear idea of the condition of forestry in the United Kingdom at the outbreak, of war it is necessary to know something of its history during the last century, for it was chiefly within that period that the woods now. being felled were planted&apos; and tended. From the middle ages onwards the State attempted to promote the cultivation of timber by legislative methods, but contrary to the custom on the continent of Europe, a very, small proportion (less than 3 per cent.) of the area of woods in this country has remained under State control. The pre-war condition of British woods was therefore the result of the action of economic and social forces on which the State has had little direct influence. It had been profoundly affected by the fact that unlimited supplies of cheap imported timber were available during the greater part of the 19th century, while the steady rise in prices which marked its close had, when war broke out, only begun to affect-the management of our woods.  .Both&apos; English and Irish private woods of the early 19th century consisted mainly of hardwoods, remnants of the once extensive indigenous forests. In Scotland only were parts of the indigenous forests coniferous, but by the beginning of last century they had been reduced to an inconsiderable area. Private woods supplied the greater part of &quot;the material required for rural and general purposes, and owing to the demand for small ^ood and for oak bark for tanning purposes coppice woods were highly remunerative. It would appear that a considerable revival, of interest in forestry, pr6&apos;bably more from an aesthetic than a practical standpoint, took place towards the end of the 18th century and continued until the middle of the 19th century. -----&apos;- Towards the end of the 18th century the growing shortage of Navy timber Ted for a time to an active planting programme by the Grown. !- It was then determined to;. plant; with oak an area of about 100,000 acres, sufficient to meet&apos; the estimated requirements of the Navy. The work was entrusted&apos; to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, who were to find land for the purpose chiefly in the ancient Royal Forests. In 1823 the Commissioners were able to report that nearly 52,000 acres:were tinder timber, but although some planting and replanting went on steadily, the total area had not increased by 1848. A revival of planting took place in the New-Forest for a lew years after the Deer Removal Act of 1851, but thereafter, as interest in wooden ships declined, interest in the Crown woods declined also, and when forestry.again,began to receive public attention, about 1880, the importance of Navy timber ; had disappeared completely. In its place, questions hearing on the. more profitable management of the Crown woods, the utilisation of waste land and the production of coniferous timber became prominent. The operations of&apos; the earlier partt;of last, century have, borne good fruit, for although the Crown woods were formerly managed chiefly, with a view to producing hardwoods, and the more recent coniferous plantations are not old enough to yield merchantable timber, there have been,set aside,iin the New Forest and Windsor woods alone, since the outbreak of war, and are felled or in process of felling, some three and a half million cubic feet of large coniferous timber and approximately one hundred thousand tons of pitwood. i-.. / Statistics of the constitution and production of British woods from period-to period are wanting, but methods of management must have been influenced by the steady increase in the demand for coniferous timber. For, as the imports of this class of. timber steadily increased during the 19th century, the character of British woods suffered a corresponding but slower change. Hardwood areas were cut over and replanted with more remunerative conifers, chiefly with larch, of which the small thinnings * are extensively used for rural and mining purposes, or with Scots pine.. The. substitution, of conifers for hardwoods was occasionally on an extensive scale, but more, often the process was introduced gradually in the form of planting small scattered, areas of conifers in i larger areas of hardwoods or coppice. The change was apparently, slow until about 1880, when the steady fall in the value of small hardwood timber, and oak bark hastened it, but;it was very far from complete at the outbreak cf war. , .;     .        &apos; ... ../. m. Slow as the: change, in the character of woods has been, still slower has-been the eradication of old and unsuitable methods-of management which had become the rule during $ie time when prospects of profitable planting were doubtful, and it has only

The State has shared the owners&apos; indifference, for the periodic rendering of correct returns has never been made compulsory. This is quite characteristic of the. attitude1 which has generally been adopted towards forestry: &apos;        y ; &apos;As to changes in the area devoted to woods, all. that is known is that in Ireland just before the war the decrease was approximately 1,000 acres per annum, and that replanting was not keeping pace with, fellings in Scotland ; probably, also, the same process, was proceeding, -though, more slowly,, in England - and Wales. &apos;&apos;: - --&apos; i ,1 . Of. the&apos;total area of approximately three million acres under woods in the United Kingdom, some 65,000 acres in England and Wales, 1,000 acres in Scotland,-and 8,000 acres in Ireland, or 2:4 per cent, of the whole, were under the control of the Office of Woods in England, Wales and Scotland,; and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, while a few thousand acres in addition were in the possession, of the War Office, the .-;Ecclesiastical,Commission, and other public departments.;, . Production of Rome-grown Timber.-Th.e total annual felling of home-grown timber, including hedgerow timber, in the United Kingdom just -before, the war has been estimated at 45,000,000 cubic feet, of which 30,000,000 cubic feet were conifers, and 15,000,000 cubic feet hardwoods. On the basis of this estimate the yield was less than 15 cubic feet per acre per annum. As noted above, the annual incre-ment was probably somewhat less than the quantity used, so that the yield would havebeen within the last.lew years that forestry education has advanced sufficiently to irnpress. on owners the advantages of modern methods. In this respect the absence 61 well-managed State forests has proved a great drawback, since, the private owner has had no ideal towards which to work, and has had to seek, abroad his information oil scientific management. ^ , .&quot;Apart from economic considerations the condition of pur., Avoods has been greatly influenced, in England and Ireland at least, by sporting: and  esthetic, cbn-sideratiohs. Mixed open woods with good game cover have been preferred to dense clean-grown woods, with consequent loss in the quantity and quality of the timber produced. Furthermore, the abundance of ground game has rendered protection of young,plantations expensive, and has been a powerful deterrent to replanting.The result of all the conditions which we have mentioned was that just before the war the woods of the United Kingdom were generallypoorly stocked and producing in annual increment certainly less than a half, and probably not more than a quarter of the amount of timber which the same soil was capable of growing under systematic management upon proper silvicultural principles. It is important to remember, however, in considering the recommendations which are put forward later in this report, that the total stock of mature timber was considerably greater than the general state of forest management would have led the casual observer to suspect. This circumstance, which has proved fortunate in the present emergency, was due in the first place to the revival of planting which took place in the early 19th century, and in the second place to the low prices which certain classes of home-grown timber realised before the war.     &apos; .,\2. Area and Production. V &quot; .
decreased as time went on. As comparative figures it is interesting to note that the total yield per acre of all German forests in the year 1899-1900 was 27  cubic feet, whereas&apos; the production from State forests varied from 53 cubic feet (Prussia) to 90 cubic feet (Baden).Percentage of Woodland in the United Kingdom and some European Countries.  The.United Kingdom is, with one exception, the most poorly wooded country in Europe, with by far the least area per head of population and with the smallest percentage of woods under State control. The actual figures for 1900 are given in the table below for a few selected countries.* More recent data do not appear to be available.Country.Per Cent, of Total Area under Wood.Area of Woodland per head of Population.Per Cent, of Woods Belonging to State (Crown).England and Wales Scotland - . -IrelandUnited Kingdom -SwedenRussia in Europe -German Empire   -NorwayFrance-      -BelgiumDenmarkPortugalEurope (1900)Acres. 0-052 0-182 0-059 0 0679-41 4-6&apos; 0-62 7-53 0-62 0-20 0-25 0-161-953-3 0-12-7 2-433 66 33 28 12-04-8 23-880It is interesting to note that European countries with less than 0&apos;85 acre of forest per head of population are importers of timber, while those with 0&apos; 95 acre and upwards are exporters. On this basis the United Kingdom would require a wooded area of approximately 40,000,000 acres in order to be totally self-supporting, and it has been computed similarly that the German Empire would require 57,000,000 acres against an existing area of approximately 35,000,000 acres. Far greater quantities of wood are-consumed as fuel in Germany, however, and if allowance were made for this fact the area required for the United Kingdom would be reduced to about 16,000,000 acres.3. State Action in Regent Years.        &apos;., ., oocjSav&quot;We nowf&quot; record in outline the manner in which successive Governments have concerned themselves with forestry. It is an unsatisfactory record on the whole due to failure to grasp the problem as a whole, and its bearing on national safety and rural development.Committees and Commissions on Forestry, 1885 to 1908.Apart from public enquiries on the management of the Crown Forests held in 1833, 1848, 1854, and 1863, the Select Committee of 1885-7 was the first of a series which have&apos; considered forestry from a national standpoint. . We record in the first place their recommendations and then their results when any results followed. .The Select Committee of 1885-1887 dealt chiefly with forestry education; the establishment of a school for British foresters was suggested either on the lines of the newly formed Indian forest school at Cooper&apos;s Hill or in conjunction with it. The formation of a Forest Board on which societies interested in woodlands should be represented was also recommended. The function of the Board was to he wholly educational and it was to be placed under the control of some department of the Government.The Departmental Committee appointed by the Board of Agriculture in 1902 summarised their recommendations as follows! :  1&apos; &quot; (a) That two areas for practical demonstration be acquired, the one in England and the other in Scotland, of not less than 2,000 acres, if possible, nor over 10,000 acres in each case.   We suggest that the Alice Holt WoodsEndres &quot; Handbuch der Forstpolitik.&quot; Cd. 1319, pp. 9-10.The figures for the United Kingdom are more recent.
in Hampshire be made available as soon as possible to serve as a denioii-stration area in England; and that a suitable estate be purchased in. Scotland as convenient as possible to Edinburgh for the same purpose. These recommendations would have to be carried out by arrangement between the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and the Board of Agriculture ; and assistance should be looked for from local authorities, societies, and individuals interested in forestry and technical education. &quot; (b) That additional facilities for instruction be afforded by the appointment of a lecturer on forestry in connection with each of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and that example plots, as defined in para-graph 15,* be provided in connection with each of these centres and with Edinburgh.&quot; (c) That a good grounding in forestry form an integral part of the curriculum of the colleges providing instruction in agriculture in Great Britain; and that short courses of instruction suitable for the requirements of young foresters be also provided there.

After showing that the question of the preservation of Irish woods had reached an acute stage, the report goes on to state that an exceptional opportunity had arrived for acquiring waste land and depleted woodlands, and that the subject was one with which the State alone could satisfactorily deal. The Committee recommended a national scheme of afforestation for Ireland, involving the acquisition of some 200,000 acres of land and 50,000 acres of existing woods, assistance to private owners and increased facilities for instruction in forestry, at an anmial cost for the whole scheme of some 45,000i. for the first ten years and 67,000L for the second.The Royal Commission on Coast Erosion, after taking evidence from numerous witnesses, brought forward two alternative schemes for State afforestation, the one involving the acquisition and planting of 150,000 acres, and the other of 75,000 acres annually for 60 and 80 years respectively.In view of their conclusions the Commissioners recommended thatj :  (1) Parliamentary powers be obtained to (a) Appoint Commissioners charged with the duty of carrying out a nationalscheme.of afforestation. (.6) Vest in them power to survey and determine what land falls under astatutory definition of &quot;suitability,&quot; and to acquire such land asfrom time to time may be required for afforestation or purposesincidental thereto.* Forest Gardens.of 100-200 acres in extent.

;&apos;c) Equip the Commissioners with compulsory powers for the acquisition of such land on the precedent of the Small Holdings Act, 1907, so far as applicable, subject to reservation of certain rights to private owners.(d) Authorise the Treasury to grant the Commission an annual free loan for the necessary period.(2) .&apos; (a) The Commissioners should prepare a geueral scheme of afforestation forthe whole of the contemplated area, extending over the entire periodof the rotation.(b) An actuarial statement should be supplied by them to the Treasuryindicating when and in what manner the loan and interest would be repaid.(c) The afforestable area should be divided into convenient sub-districts.(d) Work should be commenced in each, or as many as convenient, of thedistricts in such a way as to provide that the earlier operations, which may be regarded as experimental, should be capable of deter-mination or of forming part of the complete forest scheme for each district.The last report received a good deal of hostile criticism, partly on account of the magnitude of its proposals, which were held not to be warranted by the existing state of knowledge of the timber productivity of the types of land which it was proposed to afforest. The report undoubtedly, however, was one of the factors leading in 1909 to the establishment of the Development Fund, which marked a new attitude on the part of the State towards forestry, and it is convenient, therefore, to pause and survey the actual progress achieved to that date.Progress Achieved, 1885 to 1909. .A. number of small changes fall to be recorded in this period, though the larger question of the nation&apos;s home-grown timber supplies was still left to chance.The recommendations of the Select Committee of 1887, regarding the establish-ment of forest schools, had been fulfilled. That dealing with the establishment of a Forestry Board finds expression in the Board of Agriculture Act, 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Viet, chap. 30), in which forestry is coupled with agriculture equally in defining the powers of the Board (sections 2 (2) and (3), and 4). In these sections power is given to the Board to undertake the collection and preparation of statistics relating to forestiy, the inspection and aiding of forestry schools, and the collection of such information as they may think important for the purpose of promoting forestry. Unfortunately the Board were given neither the freedom nor the funds necessary for effective action.Partial, though not complete effect had been given to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee of 1902, by the establishment of a school for woodmen at the Forest of Dean, by the preparation of a working plan for Alice Holt Woods, by the establishment of lectureships at various Agricultural Colleges and Universities, and by the Railway Fires Act, 1905. The suggestions with regard to the inquiry on the area of woodlands, and the afforesting of catchment areas had also received a certain amount of attention.The Agriculture and Technical Instruction Act of 1899, under which the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland came into existence, gave that Department full powers for the development of State afforestation in Ireland, but little progress was made for several years owing to inadequate funds. The earliest activities of the Department were directed to forest surveys with the object of collecting information, but in 1904 a school for working foresters was established at Avondale, County Wicklow, where an area of 500 acres was purchased and laid out in demonstration plots. Other small areas of woodland were purchased from time to time, the whole of the Departments operations being financed from its Endowment Fund. Following on the Report of the Departmental Committee on Irish Forestry in 1908 a forestry vote, of 6,0001. was included in the annual estimates, and has since been continued. The actual expenditure on forestry in Ireland, exclusive of advances from the Development Fund, between 1902 and J916 was as follows : From the Departments Endowment Fund, 44,679L ; from Parlia-mentary Vote, 36,0.261,; total, 80,7051. Some 8,000 acres of depleted woodland have been acquired and are being steadily replanted and managed in accordance with the principles of scientific forestry. The educational work of the Department has been successful in turning out the type of forester badly needed in Ireland for supervising

On the other hand, the demand for advice on forest management has been comparatively-small, owing to the fact that landowners in Ireland have been more concerned with the felling of their timber than the planting and improvement of woods. The acquisition of woods by means of the Parliamentary Vote has, undoubtedly, proved a most satisfactory feature of the Departments operations. Not only have the woods been cheaply acquired in conduction with the operations of the Lands Acts, but the financial results are likely to prove highly satisfactory.With regard to Great Britain, the late Sir Stafford Howard was appointed Commissioner of Woods in 1893, and from that time until his retirement in 1912 an increasing amount of attention was paid to improving the management and increasing the extent of the Crown woods. In 1899, the first academically trained forest officer was appointed to - the Crown service, and in the same year the Hafod Fawr Estate (1,180 acres) was purchased for afforestation purposes. In 1900 the Crown acquired the Tintern Woods (3,000 acres), and in 1907 the Inverliever Estate (Argyll, 12,600 acres) for afforestation.The acquisition of the Inverliever Estate was the only practical step taken to promote forestry in Scotland, but in 1911 the Board of Agriculture for Scotland was set up. The Board was equipped with an annual sum of 200,000L, including 15,0001. hitherto voted for the Congested Districts Board. This sum was described in the Financial Resolution as being for the use of the Agricultural Commissioners. Lord Pentland, Secretary for Scotland, made the following statement in the House of Lords on 27th November, 1911 :- .&quot; It is the intention of the Government that there shall be under the Board of Agriculture as an integral and vital part of its administrative machinery a department dealing with forestry, which shall be developed as the needs of forestry may justify in Scotland and which shall be equipped with competent and efficient advice in the matter.&quot; Notwithstanding this announcement, which was repeated in almost the same words on the 4th December following, the Board have refused to allow practically all schemes connected with forestry to be financed from their funds.   All applications connected with the development of forestry, except in one or two cases of minor importance, have been referred by the Board to the Development Commissioners.Progress since the Institution of the Development Fund.We now proceed to review the progress made since the establishment of the Development Fund in 1909. The Commissioners appointed under the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act were empowered to make advances for &quot;forestry including : (1) The conducting of inquiries, experiments and research for the purpose of promoting forestry and the teaching of methods of afforestation.(2) The purchase and planting of land found after inquiry to be suitable for afforestation.&quot;It was intended that the Development Fund should be devoted principally to afforestation and agriculture, and to a minor degree to other purposes. In practice the expenditure on forestry has been relatively insignificant, as is .clearly indicated by the statement below&quot;:i:&apos; :-Statement showing the Sum Total of Advances (from the Development Fund) recommended to the Treasury up to the 31st March 1915.&quot;
Out cf a total sum of 2,043,3221. recommended to be advanced from the Develop-ment Fund for all purposes therefore, 220,7822. or 10 &quot;8 per cent, is jto be devoted to forestry.The following statement shows as nearly as we have been able to ascertain the application of the sums made available from the Development Fund for forestry purposes: Table showinq the actual Expenditure from the Development Fund on Forestry toMarch 31st, 1916	England and Wales.

The area planted as parts of considered schemes of afforestation amounts to about 600 acres. It would be easy to point to cases in which better progress has been made on private estates in the same number of years.The Committee can not but view these figures as very disappointing from the point of view of the area actually afforested. The high hopes entertained by the present Prime Minister when he was in charge of the &quot;Development Fund Bill that the establishment of the Commission would result in a large and steady expansion of afforestation have clearly not been realised. Into the causes &quot;for this it is not necessary to go, nor into the question, whether, if the war had not supervened, much more would have been done in the last two years than in the previous five of the Commission^ existence. But it has been thought right to place on record in Appendix 2. a statement of their action in forestry matters which the Development Commission have been kind enough to furnish to the Committee.Forestry Committees of 1911 and 1912.Since the institution of the Development Fund it has been found necessary to hold two other inquiries into forestry.The Departmental Committee on Forestry in Scotland (1911) J recommended the setting up of a &quot; Demonstration Forest Area &quot;of at least 4,000 acres in Scotland for the practical training of University students and forest apprentices and for research, the creation of a limited number of State trial forests, following on a survey to determine the most suitable sites, and the appointment for Scotland of an advisory forest officer. In accordance with these recommendations an advisory officer was appointed. Three advisory officers were also appointed to the staffs of the three - Agricultural Colleges in Scotland. The Board of Agriculture for Scotland have made a general survey of about 250,000 acres in various parts of Scotland, but neither the Demonstration Area nor any area for State trial forests has been acquired. An Advisory Committee was subsequently appointed by the Secretary for Scotland to advise the Board generally as to their policy. This Committee selected and recom-mended the purchase of a Demonstration Area in Aberdeenshire. The Development Commissioners, however, declined- to recommend the Treasury to advance the necessary funds for its purchase on the ground that the area was not sufficiently central.   The Commissioners later suggested the leasing of an area in Perthshire,.* Including 1,034/. expended by the Office of Woods in 1915-16 in raising tree seedliDge. (&quot; It is understood that part of this sum has been devoted to education [1 (b)l. 1 Cd. 6085, &apos; .      .
bat the Board of Agriculture and the Advisory Committee were of opinion that the terms proposed were not favourable to the State, that the area was insufficiently stocked with timber, and that for the object in view the State should acquire land in perpetuity. The net result is that not more than 100 acres have been planted in Scotland.   This has been done by means of Development Fund money.The Advisory Committee on Forestry (England and Wales, 1912)* appointed by Mr. Runciman, recommended pushing on with surveys, to be followed by the establishment of a limited number of State forests each of 5,000 acres or thereabouts, the utilisation of the Forest of Dean as a Demonstration Forest, increased provision for the education of woodmen, and a definite scheme of experimental work. In accord-ance with these recommendations the Office of Woods has enlarged the Woodmen&apos;s School, and has erected a suitable building in the Forest of Dean to fit it for use as a Demonstration Forest- An experienced forest officer has been appointed as Deputy Surveyor of the Forest who will act also as Director of the Demonstration Forest. The necessary capital expenditure and increased maintenance charges entailed by adapting the Forest of Dean for use as a Demonstration Forest are being borne by the Development Fund.Bv means of the staff provided for the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries through the Development Fund some 500,000 acres of rough land have been surveyed and 35 experimental plots have been started in woods. On the other hand, no land has been acquired for planting.The schemes of research which were being carried out at Oxford, Cambridge and other teaching centres have been interrupted by the war. The system of advisory work has already yielded good results. Since the war the services of the Advisory Officers with their special local knowledge of woods have been placed at the disposal of the Home Grown Timber Committee.The Crown Woods.We desire to add, in conclusion, a note as to the work which has been done in the Crown Woods. The change which has come over their management during the last 20 years is not yet generally known. The Forest of Dean is fast becoming an ideal training ground for British foresters. The whole enclosed area, amounting with the High Meadow, Abbots Wood, Clearwell and Tintern Woods to over 17,000 acres, is being brought under systematic management based on a very careful study of local conditions. Twenty years ago little could have been learnt in these woods save what to avoid. To-day with thriving young plantations, which in accordance with a definite working plan are replacing half stocked woods, with fine middle-aged woods on areas recently purchased, and with the whole of the woods carefully tended, this is perhaps the most instructive area of forest in Great Britain. The conversion of poor woods into better is a problem the British forester has everywhere to face and nowhere else has it been studied as closely, or on so large a scale, or with such careful record of methods, expenses and results. The conditions are certainly good, but not better than those in many other parts of the United Kingdom, and the example set here especially at Tintern, where the working plan includes woods at elevations varying from sea-level to 1,000 feet, and the afforestation of waste land should be widely followed.The woods under the charge of the Department of Agriculture for Ireland, which members of the Committee also visited, afford similar evidence of the results of scientific management.For these improvements the late Sir Stafford Howard and the officers and woodmen in the public service deserve great credit. A visit to the woods which we have referred to should go a long way to disarm the criticism of those who doubt the ability of the State to conduct successful schemes of afforestation or provide effective management.Cd. 6713.
II.-NATIONAL REQUIREMENTS IN TIMBER AND PROSPECTSOF SUPPLY.1. Requirements.Our normal requirements before the war were met chiefly by imports. The consumption of home-grown timber, which has already been estimated at 45,000,000 cubic feet per annum, was relatively unimportant. In order to emphasise our very great and increasing dependence on overseas supplies of timber we record the development of timber importation.The Growth of Timber Imports.By the end of the 18th century timber imports, though small compared with present-day standards, were beginning to increase rapidly. It is not possible to make a strictly accurate comparison of imports at various points throughout the 19th century, as the bases on which statistics have been compiled have varied from time to time ; but certain descriptions of timber have predominated throughout, and these can be traced with fair accuracy. In 1790 there were imported into Great Britain approximately !5f millions of pieces of coniferous timber, 215,000 loads of pine timber, 6,600 loads of oak plank, and 3,394 loads of oak timber. The quantities of timber 8 inches square and upwards imported in stated years in the first five decades of the 19th century were: Year.	1801.	1811.	1821.	1831.	1841.Quantity in loads* -	162,000	279,000	417,000	546,000	745,000The total imports of timber increased on about the same scale.From 1843 onwards it is possible to trace the quantities for hewn and sawn timber and staves, which represent by far the greater part of the imports of unmanufactured timber.   The quantities and values are set out in the table below. 	Hewn.		Sawn.		Staves.		Total.	Average of 10-Year Period.	Quantity 000s of Loads.	Value 000s.  	Quantity 000s of Loads.	Value 000s.

In answering this we can exclude at once teak (3), mahogany (11), and the greater proportion of the furniture woods, hardwoods, and veneers unenumerated (12), which are mainly of tropical origin. Of the total imports of wood and timber these materials account for 3&quot;7 per cent, in volume and 8&apos;5 per cent, in value for 1915, and 3&apos; 4 per cent, in volume and 10*8 per cent, in value for the average of the five years 1909-13. Of the remaining &quot; wood and timber,&quot; oak timber is the. predominating import among hardwoods, and spruce and Scots pine timber among conifers, although a fair proportion of the pitwood is of maritime pine.. There is no necessity to labour the fact.that oak, spruce, and Scots pine grow admirably in this country, and when grown under correct silvicultural conditions produce timber which is quite first-class in the case of oak, and in the case of spruce and pine is second only to the best material which the slow-growing -forests of Northern Europe produce.-Considerable doubt had been cast before the war on the technical qualities and suitability, for general uses, of our coniferous timbers, but we are convinced that this was due to the timber having often been badly grown, to neglect of grading and seasoning, and to the custom, which we are informed has sometimes prevailed, of miscalling some of the best home-grown timber foreign, rather than to any essential defects in our power of producing good timber. It has been stated, in a memorandum placed before us by the Royal Institute of British Architects, that the use.of home-grown timber for building purposes before the war was almost impossible, &quot;owing &quot; mainly to lack of * availability&apos; due to defective organisation of the home-grown &quot; timber market, and to lack of ^reliability &apos; due to unscientific afforestation.&apos;&apos; On the other hand, individual architects, who have had considerable experience in the use of home-grown timber, are of opinion that first-class soft-wood building timber can be grown in the United Kingdom.- Probably the greater part of the timber used for &quot; wood manufactures &quot; could be produced in Great Britain, while &quot;pulp of wood&quot; is made chiefly from spruce and could consequently be made from home-grown material.&quot; Rosin and turpentine oil&quot; come chiefly from the United States and France, and it is doubtful whether our climate is sufficiently warm ever to make their productionB 4

France, Portugal, Spain, and Germany have found it convenient to send us certain classes of wood, but they are importing countries and we cannot count on the continuance of their contributions.Scandinavia.The imports from Norway and Sweden have fallen off very much in recent years. They dropped by 28 per cent, between 1899 and 1913. The high prices ruling during the war have led to anticipation fellings and increased the shipments for the moment, but this revival cannot be permanent since in Norway, and we believe also in Sweden, the annual cut has been in excess of the annual growth.The United States.Our imports from the United States are diminishing slowly and must con-tinue to diminish. According to a report^ made for the American Government in 1910, the annual cut removes three times as much timber as the annual growth can replace, while forest fires further hasten the depletion of the forests. It is difficult, in Europe, to grasp the scale of these disasters. In 1825 the Miramichi fire (Maine and New Brunswick) destroyed over 4,500 square miles of forest, or about the woodland area of Great Britain. In 1871, the Peshtigo fire (Wisconsin) destroyed 1,800 square miles. In 1894, 210 square miles were consumed in the Hinckley fire (Minnesota).   Much has been done to curb this danger, but it is not yet unders E. Zon, &quot; Forest Resources of the World,&quot; Government Printing Office, Washington, 1910. U  4656 0remunerative. Acetate of lime, acetone, acetic acid, wood tar, and methyl alcohol are the products of the distillation of wood, and are produced in Great Britain.Of the &quot;manufactures into which wood enters to a large hut varying degree,&quot; paper and articles of paper are made to a considerable extent from wood pulp, the British match industry uses both home-grown and imported timbers, while &quot; toys and games &quot; and &quot; brooms and brushes &quot; make use of white timber, such as birch and beech, which grow extremely well in almost all parts of the United Kingdom.We desire, therefore, in concluding this review, to emphasise the fact that the question of reducing our dependence on imports of timber and wood derivatives depends simply on the area of land which the country is able and prepared to devote to afforestation.2. Prospects of Supply.We have investigated the question of supplies after the war from two points of view : first, under ordinary trade conditions in time of peace, and secondly, under the conditions which will probably exist in a future war. We deal here only with the former aspect since the latter is that on which we have mainly based our recom-mendations and is consequently considered in detail at a later stage.In the year before the war (1913) the countries from each of which we obtained 5,000 loads and upwards of coniferous timber and pitwood were as follows : Coniferous Timber and Pitwood in Loads.

It has a Department of Forestry, with a staff of trained officers ; it publishes a series of admirable reports and &quot;surveys; it encourages planting by the distribution of large numbers of plants ; it has setits hand to the difficult task of introducing systematic management and checking the deadly fire evil. Provided these operations are sufficiently hastened and extended, there appears to be no reason why the Canadian forests should not supply the United Kingdom with coniferous timber and meet its growing needs for many generations. Meanwhile, the forest capital of Canada is growing less year by year. This, we submit, is an Imperial question of the first magnitude which deserves the immediate attention of the Imperial and Dominion Governments.Newfoundland has considerable reserves of timber, which, though under a separate Government, form part of the same Imperial question. . They illustrate* R. Zon, &quot; Forest-Resources of the.World,&quot; Government Printing Office, Washington, 1910. t Sir W. Schlich, &quot;Journal of Foresty, 1916.&quot;&quot;* Sir W. Schlich, in the &quot;Journal of Forestry, 1916,&quot; gives the figures 315,562 square miles, on the authority of Mr. Campbell, the head of the Dominion Forest Department. Sir Clifford Siftotf, Chairman of the Commission of Conservation, stated, however (Report for 1915) that there was &quot; strong reason for the belief that the forest resources of Canada had been much over-estimated.&quot;S Mr. 11. H. Campbell, Report for 1915 of the Commission of Conservation, Canada.II Ellwood Wilson, Forester, Laurentide Co., Ltd., Report for 1916 of the Commission of Conservation.anything like complete control. Only last spring (1916) over 1,000 square miles were burnt in North Carolina. The home consumption of the United&apos;States is the largest in the world, and has rapidly overtaken the production. The net exports of timber have, in consequence, sunk to less than 3,000,000. loads.&quot;:::&quot; The gravity of the position has been recognised, and great efforts are now being made to guard against a timber famine. A well-organised Bureau of Forestry, with a staff of highly, trained officers, is gradually introducing systematic management into- the State reserves and into private forests.j Though the American forests were, till lately, regarded as inexhaustible, and still contain larger reserves of timber than those of any other country, with the possible exception of Russia, it is evident that, after a limited number of years, we can no longer count on supplies from them. The United States already import from Canada more timber than they send to us. Their growing consumption, and the measures they are taking to bring the annual cut into conformity with the annual growth, will soon reduce their exports to nil.The British Empire.Canada, with some 315,000 square miles j of timber land of commercial value and a much larger area of scrub and waste land, has reserves of timber which rank after those of Russia and the United States as the third largest in the world. The survev of these forests is still in progress. The annual cut was in 1891 found to be well below the annual growth, but, unhappily, forest fires claim far more trees than fall to the lumberman&apos;s axe. The destruction by fire has been put by some authorities at several times the annual growth. In 1914, which was a dry year, it was estimated that 438,567 acres of forest were burnt and standing timber equal to 350,000,000 feet board measure destroyed.! In 1915 there were stated to be 10,000 square miles of land in Quebec burnt fifty to sixty years ago and producing nothing, jj The home consumption of the Dominion is at present comparatively small and the exports are larger than those of any country except Russia. The share of these exports coming to the United Kingdom has been rapidly diminishing while that of the United States has increased. The following figures relating to the exports of forest products from Canada illustrate the change which has occurred : 
incidentally, how rapidly forests which, at first.sight, seem vast may he absorbed. The Newfoundland woods cover 10,000 square miles, but more than a third has been taken over, by a single company. The produce from this area, nearly equal tc the whole, woodlands of Great Britain, feeds the pulp and paper mills of the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company and supplies the requirements of four British, news papers. * Newfoundland has assisted the United Kingdom during the war with supplies of pitwood.from.the three-mile belt round the coast reserved by the Colonial Government for the use of the Colony and not ordinarily available for export except in the form of pulp. Labrador, which is a dependency of Newfoundland, is believed to have considerable resources in timber suitable for pulpwood and pitwood.. India, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are already importers of soft woods, and no relief with regard to future supplies,&apos;but rather the contrary, may be expected from those quarters.,Russia.Russia, as will be evident from the facts already given, is now the crux of the whole question. She is, and has been for several years, the only source on which we could, under present conditions, rely to make good the decline in our imports of coniferous timber from other countries and meet our ever-expanding demand. She has accomplished this by increasing her supplies to us from 2,241,000 loads in 1889 to 5,401,000 loads in the year preceding the war. We have now reached the point when any check in the Russian supply would inevitably cause a timber famine in the United Kingdom. The Russian forests are something of a mystery, and. the reports which reach us are conflicting. The area of land classed as forest in Russia and Siberia is enormous, amounting to 1,260,000 square miles, of which by far the greater part belongs to the State. Much of the so-called forest is without commercial value. Of the million square miles belonging to the State less than two-thirds are true forest-land. Applying this proportion to the whole area, the total extent of true forest land in Russia and Siberia, is estimated at 814,000 square miles.&quot;!&quot; To this must be added 82,000 square miles of forest in Finland, making a total of 896,000 square miles for the Russian Empire. These forests, spread over a very wide area and in climates ranging from; temperate to arctic, vary greatly in the amount of timber they carry and in the rate of growth. The forests of Central Russia appear to be generally of poor quality, and with regard to Siberia, railway construction on a large scale would be necessary to make its timber available for export. Devastation by the inhabitants and fires, have, also deprived a great part7 of the Siberian forests of their value4 The timber imported into the United Kingdom has hitherto come from the virgin forests of Finland and the Baltic provinces and from Archangel. While the information at our disposal indicates that the timber produced by these northern forests could be very considerably increased without exceeding the annual growth, it is evident that the permanency of the supply must depend on the introduction of systematic management. The growth in the northern forests is extremely slow, and it will take a long time to replace the pine, spruce and. larch now being felled. It must also be remembered that the development of the Russian Empire is certain to be accompanied by an increased home consumption, which may, as in the United States, gradually curtail or even extinguish the reserves available for export. We have already indicated what this would mean for the&apos; United Kingdom.Summary.The position may therefore be broadly summed up as follows: The United Kingdom is dependent for more than 60 per cent, of its timber on the virgin forests of foreign countries which; are being steadily depleted. The proportion derived from sources within the Empire fell from 22 per cent, in 1899 to 10 per cent, in 1913. Every year we become more dependent on Russia, which in 1913 supplied us with nearly half our total imports. We have no means-of reckoning how long the virgin forests will last, but unless&apos;they are brought under systematic management their exhaustion can only be a question of time. The arguments advanced on this subject by competent students have been supported since 1895 by a steady rise in price. The only large reserves within the British Empire are those of Canada which are rapidly&quot; being* Sir Daniel Morris, &quot; Scottish.&quot; Geographical Magazine,&quot; August 1916. t E. Zon.; J Report.-of, Russiau Finance Minister, quoted, by Sir W. Schlich, &quot; Forestry in the United Kingdom,&quot; 1904.C 2
depleted by fire. The Dominion Government has initiated measures for their pro-tection, but the problem is both large and difficult. It is one in which the United Kingdom has a deep interest since the Canadian reserves are the only source on which the United Kingdom can fall back if supplies from Russia fail. The arrangement, prevailing before the war under which the exports from the Canadian forests were absorbed by the United States, while the United Kingdom drew its supplies from Russia, no doubt found much justification in economy of transport, but unless the Canadian forests can be adequately protected and made available in case of necessity for the United Kingdom, it is certain that the area of timber within the British Isles must be increased far beyond that recommended in the proposals made in the following pages. We commend this Imperial question to the attention of the Conference meeting in London. It is urgent because preparations made now cannot mature for many years, and unless provision is made now either in Canada, Russia or the British Isles, it is practically certain that the United Kingdom will find timber difficult to procure in sufficient quantities before such preparations can mature.III. EXPERIENCE GAINED AS A RESULT OF THE WAR.1. Consumption of Timber.It was our original intention to have set out as nearly as possible the relative amounts of timber consumed for military and for commercial purposes during the war, and to have ascertained the minimum amounts on which the nation could subsist for a limited period. With the progress of the war, however, the line of demarcation between military and commercial enterprise has become more and more indefinite. Industrial processes have been adapted to military ends, and the maintenance of our commercial exports has become an object of national anxiety since our credit and consequent power to maintain armies in the field has been partially dependent upon it. On the other hand, the desire to restrict imports, particularly those of a bulky nature such as timbers, has been general from an early stage of the war. During 1916, imports (such as furniture woods) which could be dispensed with were prohibited, and finally in February 1917 came the total, prohibition of timber imports except under license. At the present time it is the intention to supply the army in France with timber felled in that country and to meet the home demand for timber and for pitwood from stocks of timber growing in the United Kingdom.However successful this policy may prove, the fact must remain that our ability to carry on the war for thirty months has been due to the vast supplies of timber which have been imported from abroad. Timber has, in this respect, proved itself absolutely essential for the rapid construction of buildings, railways, and engineering works of all kinds, for packing cases, for coal mines and for a thousand miscellaneous uses for which no other raw material is so well adapted.We have already given on p. 16 statements showing quantities and values of imported wood and timber for the average of the five years 1909-13, for 1915, and for 1916. The broad fact emerging from these figures is that our imports in 1915 were approximately equal to 75 per cent, of our normal pre-war imports, and in 1916 to 63 per cent. Such reductions as have been designedly effected in furniture woods have not affected materially the percentages for other categories except in the case of converted soft woods which amounted to.81 per cent, of the pre-war amount in 1915 and to 66 per cent, in 1916. Unfortunately, the Board of Trade returns are defective as regards timber transported in vessels requisitioned by the Government. We have had enquiries made and have ascertained that in some cases the cargoes and vessels have been included in the returns both of trade and of navigation, and that in other cases they have not, and that in still other cases the cargo has been included and the vessel has not, or vice versa. We understand also that it is now not possible to give a correct statement. It is clear, however, that the Board of Trade figures are an under-statement of the actual imports and that the returns affected are chiefly those relating to converted soft-woods, including sleepers. It would very possibly be found, if an accurate statement were available, that the imports of those materials in 1915 were little below the average for the five years, 1909-1913. In any case the magnitude of the figure is very remarkable when it is borne in mind that the private building trade, which normally consumes the greater part of imported soft-woods has been very greatly restricted and that special efforts have been made to stimulate home production.Probably a very fair measure of the essential character of timber is indicated by the prices which traders have been prepared to pay for imported material.   The table
below states the price per load  or various classes for the average of the five years 1909-13, for 1915, and for 1916, and comparative prices for 1915 and 1916 on the basis of the 1909-13 prices being equal to 100.   It will be observed that the rise in. 1915 over 1909-13 prices was substantial, and that 1916 prices, excluding staves, mahogany, and furniture woods, averaged over 2\ times those of 1909-13.Table showing Average Prices of Selected Forest Products for 1909-13, .1915 and 1916, and Prices for 1915 and 1916 compared with 1909-13 Prices - 100.Description.Average Price, 1909-13. &amp;Average Price, 1915.Compared with 1909-13 = 100.Average Price, 1916.Compared with 1909-13 = 100.].

The time for compiling detailed statements of the. type which wre would have desired is naturally inopportune, and it is obvious also that in some cases large quantities of timber must have been used, without the direct knowledge of the central Depart-ments, by controlled firms producing munitions. The information which we have received, however, is sufficient to indicate with fair precision the huge quantities of timber required for the direct conduct of the war.We have not considered it advisable to give detailed figures. It may, however, be stated that the consumption of timberby the War Office alone, which in the year before the war was 10,500 standards, was for a recent complete period of a year during the war 600,000 standards, or approximately 100,000,000 cubic feet; and that the current consumption per month of the timber which was being supplied at the end of 1916, through the agency of the Office of Works, was equivalent to the yield of about 5,000 acres of the kinds of coniferous timber which have recently been felled in Great Britain for the purpose.2. Shipping absorbed in the Timber Trade.As timber is, for its value, one of the bulkiest articles which we import, it is of interest to ascertain what proportion of our shipping resources are employed in that particular trade and how far shipping would be available for other and possibly more vital needs if the United Kingdom could be made self-supporting in timber for a limited period of emergency.The total imports of wood and timber were, for the average of the five years 1909-13, 10,204,000 loads ; for 1915, 7,668,000 loads ; and for 1916, 6,319,000 loads.C 3
In the same respective periods there entered British ports from foreign countries and British Possessions the following net tonnage of shipping with cargoes : 1909-13, 43,858,000 ; 1915, 33,724,000; 1916, 30,059,000. If it be assumed that two loads of timber of 50 cubic feet correspond on the average with one net register ton of shipping-entered, then the imports of wood and timber for 1909-13 required 5,102,000 tons; for 1915, 3,834,000, and 1916, 3,159,500 net tons of shipping, and the percentages of the total shipping entered with cargoes become respectively 11 &quot;6 per cent., 11&apos;4 per cent., and 10 &quot;5 per cent.In addition to the imports of wood and timber, wood manufactures to the value of 2,695,000L and pulp of wood to the amount of 859,000 tons and the value of 4,058,0001. were imported annually on the average during the five years 1909-13. Probably that&apos; amount of pulp of Avood would consume about 500,000 tons of shipping. We have no ready means of estimating the space occupied by wood manufactures, but it would, probably be safe to reckon on a minimum of 150,000 tons of shipping The total shipping required for wood manufactures and pulp of wood would consequently become 650,000 tons, or 1&apos; 5 per cent, of the total shipping entered with cargoes. The total proportion for wood and timber, wood manufactures, and pulp of wood for 1909-13 then becomes 13&apos; 1 per cent.The average annual value of these materials for 1909-13 was 34,315,000L, or, on a 13 per cent, basis, 6Z. per net ton of ^shipping. The amount of corn and grain imported was 10,621,000 tons, valued at 82,032,000L ; and if 2 tons weight be taken as corresponding to 1 net shipping ton, the tonnage required was 12&apos;1 per cent, of the whole and the value per shipping ton 15L 10s. On the other hand, the total value of imports was 699,299,0001., or 161. per shipping ton. It would appear-consequently that our timber and wood-pulp imports consume as much smjyping as our grain imports, though the former are only about 40 per cent, as valuable, bulk for bulk, as the latter, and less than 40 per cent, as valuable as the average of our total imports.From the above sketch it is clear that we were dependent before the war and have continued to be dependent during the first two years of the war on from one-seventh to one-eighth of the commerci al tonnage entering our ports with cargoes being deyoted to the transport of timber and pulp of wood, and the question arises whether it would be possible in some future war, if adequate supplies of timber were growing at home, to cease timber imports altogether and to devote the tonnage thus set free to other more urgent purposes. The question is of more than usual interest because it is clear that with the development of submarine vessels and aircraft, the reduction of imports to a minimum bulk may become of the utmost urgency.We have already set out in the table on page 17 the chief countries from which our timber supplies are derived, and in this connection coniferous timbers and wood products form such an overwhelming proportion of the whole that hardwoods need not be considered here. For the five-year period before the war, 6,454,000 loads of hewn fir, pitwood and sawn, planed or dressed fir, out of a total of 9,240,000 loads came from Northern Europe, i.e., from Russia, Norway and Sweden, whilst Canada, U.S.A., France, Spain and Portugal furnished between them 2,595,000 loads. It appears from an examination of the Navigation Returns that normally the trade with Northern Europe is conducted largely in neutral bottoms, vessels entering with timber or other cargo or in ballast and clearing with coal, the clearances with cargo being- greater than the entrances with cargo. For instance, on the average for the five-year period 1909-13 there entered with cargo annually 5,886,000 net tons from Norway, Sweden and Northern Russia against 0,548,000 tons cleared. Of the shipping-entering from these ports, 1,492,000 tons were British, against 4,394,000 tons foreign. It is fairly clear, therefore, that although the State, if freed from anxiety with regard- to timber supplies, might make a considerable saving in freight by withdrawing its own shipping from, the North European routes, the economy is not so great as might appear at first sight. What has happened in the present war and may not improbably happen again is that we have been, as a nation, dependent on Norway and Sweden in particular for our timber and have been forced, in order to obtain it, to use our main -economic weapon, coal, with the result that we have been handicapped as far as power to negotiate for other necessary commodities is concerned. Our timber trade with France,&apos; Spain and Portugal has also been on this basis of exchange for coal. If, when we; are able to do without foreign timber, the coal export were maintained, our gain would be not only in shipping, but also in power to secure other imports, or in exchange, or in general power of negotiation. If the coal export were stopped, we should gain in labour supply and also in shipping, for though the ships liberated
wo aid no doubt have to seek coal eMewhere they would, except when bringing coal home, be available for relieving the freight position in general.It is not possible to determine from the Navigation Returns how far the timber trade with North America is carried in British bottoms. If the proportion is the same as. for the whole trade, in which British shipping is predominant, it should be possible to effect a considerable saving, although, as pointed out above, the bulk of the timber imports do not come normally from that continent.The following table gives an analysis of the shipping entering with cargoes in 1909-13 and in 1916 from the chief countries from which we draw1 our timber supplies: Table showing the Amount of Shipping entered, with Cargoes only, on the -Average for the Five Years 1909-1913 and for 1916.Thousands of tons net.Country whence entered.

The Organisation of the Home Supply in War.We proceed to give some account of the difficulties of improvising during the war an organisation for making our home supplies available for war purposes. The immediate effect of the war was to compel the wood-using industries of the country to draw larger supplies from home. This affected in the first instance chiefly the mines, the railways, and the box-making trade/With regard to the mines, imports of pitwood were, for a considerable period, fairly well maintained, and although a certain amount of anxiety was felt with regard to the position, and collieries in the early months of the war bought up areas of woodland, there was little real anxiety as to the position until 1916.- Even then coal-owners were reluctant to enter into long contracts, and felt fairly safe in relying upon the continued importation of the foreign wood, which was undoubtedly preferred. It was not until the recrudescence of submarine warfare in an aggravated form that real apprehension was felt, and urgent measures were contemplated for supplying the pits from home resources.As regards the railways, these had, to a large extent, drawn their supplies of sleepers from the Baltic, and practically all the railway specifications have in view the supply of sleepers cut from &quot;Baltic Blocks.&quot; The Baltic was, however, closed, and the White Sea trade had not hitherto supplied sleepers to any extent. The alternative foreign supply was the G-ulf of Mexico, but it&apos;became increasingly difficult to import longleaf pine, particularly since the Armies demanded large quantities of sleepers both for railways and for defence purposes. The home railways, though they had large stocks on hand and.renewals were very much cut down, soon sought to:buy largeO 4
quantities of home-grown timber at prices considerably above those obtainable under peace conditions, though much below what they had to pay for imported material.A certain amount of home-grown timber had always been used for box-making, particularly in Scotland, for such purposes as herring and soap boxes, and the stimulus given to the box-making trade by the demands of the war resulted in an increasing use of native timber for such purposes. It appears also that native timber was used to an increasing extent for building purposes, chiefly for temporary hutments, and cases are reported where native timber was sold as Archangel. Nevertheless, this period was marked by the frequent use, even for temporary purposes, of imported timbers bought and transported at very high prices, while local timber quite suitable for the work stood neglected in the woods.The increasing difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies for the Army brought about a new position, and led to the appointment of the Home Grown Timber Committee, which was charged primarily with the duty of obtaining supplies for Government Departments. The principal supplies for which the Committee were responsible were sleepers and poles for defence purposes, telegraphs, &amp;c. The scantling and boards which the Committee could supply were not regarded as entirely suitable for hutting purposes, although suitable for defence purposes, such as the construction of trenches. The hutments which have been put up in this country, particularly by the Canadian Forestry Corps, tended, however, to show that such timber is perfectly suitable for temporary purposes.When the Committee had to face the problem of increasing supplies they were met first of all by the fact that, for the most part, timber was only offered voluntarily in comparatively small lots ; secondly, that portable plant, which alone could be used for dealing with small lots of timber, could not be readily obtained in large quantities, and, further, that the labour accustomed to dealing with timber in the woods, and sawing round timber, had been seriously depleted.by the withdrawal of men to the Army. But for the existence under the direct control of the Crown of large blocks of timber in the New Forest and the neighbourhood of Windsor, production in the early stages of the Committee&apos;s work would have been even slower and more difficult than it actually was. To a certain extent the difficulty of acquiring large blocks of timber was overcome by obtaining compulsory powers under the Defence of the Realm Act. In all their operations, however, the Committee were limited by the fact that such blocks existed in a few districts only.As regards saw-milling plant, attempts were made to use estate plant to its utmost capacity, but it was found that such plant was rarely efficient. It has to be remembered that sawmilling in some branches is a highly skilled trade. If the workmen do not understand the engine or the proper care of their saws, good work is impossible. It was speedily found that very little help could be expected from estates, although in a few instances it was possible to enter upon contracts with them. Very little plant was available for hire, and what there was was not satisfactory. A certain number of contracts were made with contractors who supplied their own plant, and in a number of instances the Committee themselves supplied plant to contractors. After some time and trouble it was found possible to obtain all the plant required for the labour that was available in the United Kingdom.The lack of native labour forced the Committee to have regard to the possibility of importing labour. Belgian labour, from which much was hoped, proved to be disappointing in quantity and quality, and at about the end of 1916 the experiment came to an end owing to the withdrawal of practically the last of the Belgian workmen to join the Army. A more successful experiment was made with the importation of Portuguese labour, and this scheme was being developed when the Committee was dissolved. The most successful scheme was the introduction of Canadian lumbermen. These men were enlisted as soldiers and came over as a military unit. Other men, not fit for General Service were withdrawn from combatant units and drafted to Forestry Battalions which were ultimately constituted into a corps. The first equip-ment came from Canada, but to an increasing extent it became necessary to rely upon the manufacture of plant in this country, and ultimately a special machine shop was set up, and arrangements were made with certain firms to supply boilers and machinery to the specification of the technical officers of the corps. Meanwhile, the demands of the Army for men had increased the difficulties of obtaining native labour, although the Committee&apos;s direct operations showed constant expansion.Although production was developing constantly, haulage became an increasingly difficult problem.   There was an actual shortage of horses, and mechanical traction
was dime alt to get on account of the very large demands for military purposes. In addition, the labour required to look after horses and to drive mechanical tractors was very hard to find.Another difficulty in the way of transport was the state of the roads over which timber had to be hauled. These for the most part are light country roads, sufficient for the normal traffic, but quite unfitted to carry a continuous timber traffic. As a result, in practically every district of the country it was necessary to arrange for the making up of roads.Another aspect of the transport problem is presented by the inadequate facilities at most country stations to deal with any considerable volume of timber traffic. It was necessary to construct sidings in certain places, and this step has also had to be taken by timber merchants. The supply of timber waggons upon the railways was also found to be inadequate, although no serious difficulty was found in obtaining sufficient five and ten ton trucks to carry sawn timber. It was possible to do very little in the way- of water transport. A certain amount was done by sea in Scotland, and a certain amount by barging in England. The latter proved, however, to be expensive and was&apos;only advantageously adopted when it was necessary to deliver timber at a wharf.The war found the home timber market in an unorganised condition and con-sequently unable to meet efficiently the sudden and unprecedented demands placed upon it. The quantities of timber handled were relatively small and the plant and methods of dealing with them very imperfect. It has been suggested to us that the remedy lies in concentrating planting operations into large blocks so as to admit of the installation of permanent large scale conversion plants under normal conditions. -We are of opinion, however, that this method will not prove a complete solution of the problem. It is inevitable that there should be large numbers of relatively small, but in. the aggregate valuable plantations throughout the country, and, indeed, the proposals which we make at a later stage aim at increasing the stock of timber in such plantations. Even small woods have a great value when near to the place where the timber is required, since there is a saving in transport and local supplies of labour can be utilised. The problem appears to us to be not so much a question of scale as of methods. We think, therefore, that it is necessary to ensure that even under normal conditions the home market is organised on adequate and efficient lines, and we have given particular attention to this question at a later stage in our report.TV -THE CASE FOR ADOPTING AN ADEQUATE FOREST POLICY FORTHE UNITED KINGDOM.The facts marshalled in the foregoing chapters have shown that the forest policy of the State has hitherto been totally inadequate and have led us to two conclusions:-(1) That dependence on imported timber is a grave source of weakness in war. .(2) That our supplies of timber, even in time ot peace, are precarious and lie too much outside the Empire.To these must be added a third reason for extensive planting: (3) That afforestation would increase the productiveness and population of large areas of the British Isles which are now little better than waste.WTe propose in this chapter to summarise, under each of these heads, the argu-ments which convince us that an adequate forest policy ought, without further delay, to be adopted for the United Kingdom.1. National Safety and Efficiency in War.So far as timber is concerned, the surprises of the war have been the immense amount of wood consumed by modern military operations and the scarcity of ships to carry it. For lack of sufficient reserves of its own, the United Kingdom has been compelled to continue the importation of timber on a very large scale. It has done so at a heavy loss-(1) in prices, freight, and insurance, (2) in the absorption of tonnage urgently required for other purposes, (3) in cargoes sunk by the enemy, and (4) nTthe depreciation of the rate of exchange. We have, to speak plainly, run risks against which every other considerable country has long taken care to protectTJ  4656   &apos; &apos;J
itself, and have,, in consequence., lost heavily, in money and energy which would otherwise&apos; have been available for the prosecution of the: war. The prices and quantities oi imported wood and timber and pulp of wood have been set out on p. 16, and the enormous increase in the cost of these (materials during 1915-16 will be observed at a glance. We have estimated that the additional cost compared with the average value of the. same material for the five years, before the war was for 1915 13,0:0.0,0001. and 1910 24,000,0001, making a total loss for the two years, due entirely to the war, of 37,000,0001. This charge fell in the first instance on merchants and contractors, but as they were employed- almost exclusively oh Govern-nient work, the loss was borne in the end by the Treasury, with the partial exception of that incurred on pitwood. The increase has been.chiefly due to the cost of fheight.;a&apos;nd insurance, though the.prices at ports of shipment have also risen. An authoritative report circulated to the timber trade states that &quot;it would be no &quot; exaggeration to say that at least three-fourths of this extra outlay for wooden &quot; /goods has gone into the pockets of shipping owners,; - chiefly of Scandinavian &quot;nationality.&quot;:&apos;       ..... ..The timber purchased abroad by the Office of Works and other Departments: appears to be only partly included in the above figures. It has been transported by the Admiralty, and; we are unable to give any estimate of the cost of this operation^ Owing to the increasing deficiency in tonnage, freights for ordinary timber; traders have gradually stiffened with occasional fluctuations until, with the opening of the unrestricted submarine campaign, it has become necessary to prohibit the importation of timber.The Prime Minister in his speech in the House of Commons on limitation of imports (February 23rd, 1917) placed timber first as absorbing most of the tonnage. He described the situation as one &quot; which undoubtedly calls for the gravest uneasiness,&quot; and said of timber &quot; obviously if tonnage is to be saved this is the first problem to be attacked.&quot; The&apos; country has thus ultimately been thrown back on its own timber resources, and it can&apos;only be accounted as a fortunate circumstance, unlikely to recur in a future war, that the nation was able to draw for so long even at great pecuniary loss-on other countries for supplies of a material vital to the conduct of hostilities.; It is certain that these risks and losses will increase rather than diminish in any future war. In case of war with the northern timber-producing countries they might even prove decisive. They are not necessarily limited to war in which we ourselves take part or to war&apos;at all, since international disputes may be decided by commercial boycott. An adequate forest policy would guard against them by rendering imports unneces-sary during such emergencies. Timber, which on account of its bulk is in war the most inconvenient of imports, happens to be one of the few commodities which can be; held hi reserve with slight loss, and in time of stress utilised at almost any stage of its growth. The war has disclosed no demand which could not have been satisfied by timber grown in this country with its favourable Soil and climate and abundance of. waste land&apos;. :The cost of home-grown timber has risen above the very low prices prevailing before the war, but it has kept far below that of imported timber. In 1915 the Home-Grown Timber Committee was buying and manufacturing British sleepers for 6s. and less, while the railway companies were paying as much as 12s. for imported sleepers no better in quality. While the price of imported pitwood, which averaged 32s. in the 12 months ending July 1914, rose to 152s. in 1916, the average.price of home-grown pitwood has not risen above 65s. per ton. It is worth noting:.that the Welsh mines, which supply the Navy with coal, have been indebted for much of their timber before and during the war to the foresight of our French Allies this timber being derived from the Landes near Bordeaux, where the French Government between 1786 and 1905 had been instrumental in securing the afforesta-tioh of&apos; 1,760,000 acres of waste land.* If our statesmen, even 30 years ago, had shown equal foresight, most of the timber required for this purpose could have been grown on the Welsh hills.It is useless to speculate what will be&apos;the condition of our woods at the end of the war. . Serious inroads have already been made at the present time (April 1917) on;&quot;stocks.of mature coniferous timber, middle-aged woods and young woods fit for pitwood, and it is only a question of time before the whole of the country&apos;s growing timber which is fit.for commercial use must disappear. The result is a depletion which the Government cannot afford to neglect. This country, poorer in timber at the beginning of the war than any other European country except Portugal, will be;Vii,:  ,      - - i    &apos;      - &quot;: * See Appendix 3.
more destitute still at its close. Even if every acre felled is replanted it will be many years before the present output can be repeated. We take it for granted that the Crown Woods will be replanted and also those on private estates where forestry is systematically practised. We are equally certain that many owners will be deterred by heavy taxation and the high bank rate from sinking capital in work, which yields no return for many years, and that a large proportion of the area felled during the war will remain vacant for many years unless the Government adopt measures to promote replanting.In addition to the expenditure on wood, timber, and pulp of wood we paid in 1915 822,1961. for imported calcium acetate, acetic acid, and acetone. Any interruption in the supply of these materials which were essential for rnilitary purposes would have been a very serious matter. They could have been produced in this country though not with our present small area of wood, for they represent for 1915 an annual equivalent of about 800,000 tons of wood. Their manufacture might absorb the refuse of British woods which, owing to the small demand for firewood, is now wasted.2. Precautions against a Famine op Coniferous Timber.We have been dealing up to this point with national safety, but anxiety is by ho means confined to that side of the question. It is hardly less necessary to ensure ourselves against scarcity of timber in time of peace. We are speaking here not of hardwoods or of timber produced in tropical climates, but of the coniferous timber and pitwood of which 90 per cent, of our timber imports consist. The force of the arguments advanced on the subject by competent students for the last 30 years has been greatly enhanced by a steady increase in consumption and a steady rise in price. Our own imports increased between 1895 and 1913 at the rate of 100,000 loads a year, and the price rose during the same period by no less than 33 per cent. No substitute has been found for coniferous timber. Every year it is used for new purposes. The amount, for instance, now converted into pulp and substitutes derived from wood fibre, including paper, is very large and rapidly increasing.Even countries with large and well-managed forests, such as France, with 37,000 square miles, or Germany, with 54,600 square miles being in each case more than half an acre per head of the total population -now find it necessary to import con-siderable quantities of timber. The net imports of France were reckoned in 1910 at 880,000 loads, or 6 per cent, of her total consumption, those of Germany at 7,000,000 loads, or 27 per cent, of the consumption.0 These countries, though the proportion of their imports is still small and not such as to be a cause of weakness in war, spare no effort to increase their home supplies. For the United Kingdom, with less than 5,000 square miles&quot;!&quot; 0^ wood, being less than one-tenth of an acre per head, and imports amounting in the year immediately preceding the war to over 10,000,000 loads, or nine-tenths of the total consumption, the risks are many times multiplied, and the state of the world&apos;s reserves of coniferous wood becomes a very grave and very urgent consideration.These considerations, which we have dealt with fully on pp. 17-20, bring us to the conclusion that successive Governments would have done well to listen to the warnings addressed to them on this subject for the last 30 years by the Royal Commissions and Departmental Committees of&apos; their own appointment, as well as by. societies and private individuals who have studied these matters. We believe ,that the policy of neglect cannot be further prolonged without very grave risks, and. that no Government, once informed of the facts, will have any desire to prolong it.i - ....... -3. Social and Economic Benefits of Afforestation.We desire to record our convictions that, quite apart from the considerations already advanced, a policy of afforestation is justified by the great benefit it would, confer on the United Kingdom.&apos;  In Sparsely Populated Districts. The districts which would benefit most are; those which are now poorest and most backward, such as the hilly regions of northern England, Wales and Ireland, the Border Country and, most of all, the Highlands of Scotland;   No one disputes that large areas in these districts now devoted to sheep...  . - .   * Raphael Zon. .

or deer ought, if possible, to be put to more productive uses. In these tracts, now almost uninhabited, the cost of reclamation and equipment is such that no agricul-tural development is economically possible unless some other industry is present to help to bear the preliminary outlay on roads, bridges, &amp;c., and provide occupations to which the small farmer can turn in winter when he would otherwise be idle and to which his family can look for employment. In certain favoured localities, sea-fishing, mines or quarries may supply this want, but in many districts silviculture and the industries based on it are the only agencies that can do so. The economic contrast between a valley where the hills are under wood and one where .they are devoted to grazing or sport is little - short of amazing. A thousand acres of hill grazing require the services of one, or at most two, shepherds, and have even on the best land of that type an annual production per acre of less than ten lbs. of mutton and two lbs. of wool. The same area under forest requires the services of ten men, besides occasional labour in nurseries and young plantations, and labour employed in industries dependent on the forest, while its annual production is, at a low estimate, 1,000 loads (50,000 cubic feet) of coniferous timber. When the woods extend to several thousands of acres, the new values they create become a potent factor in the development of the district, justify the building of roads, railways, and telegraphs, and serve to support churches, schools, doctors, shops, and many of the coinforts and amenities of civilisation which are out of reach of the solitary crofter.Small Hold,ings.-Forestry opens a new vista for the small holdings policy. It makes the creation of small holdings not only possible but necessary in districts where the cost of creation would otherwise be prohibitive. The small holdings will be grouped together on the best land within or near the forests so as to economise labour in the working of the holdings, to afford opportunities for co-operation in buying and selling and to provide an ample supply of juvenile and female labour for nursery work. Families settled on new holdings in forest areas will be a net addition to the resident rural population. We believe that small holdings in connection with forestry will fulfil the following conditions which are essential to success : (1) The land being included in large areas acquired for afforestation can be provided at a moderate rent and free from claims for severance, &amp;c.(2) Sufficient land will be available for summer grazing.(3) The character and situation of the agricultural land will be such as to give special opportunities for initiative or co-operative effort on the part of the small holders.(4) Forestry fits in with farm work better than any other industry. The demand for labour is regular in amount and permanent in character, though sufficiently elastic to fit in with the demands of other occupations. It requires most labour in winter when the farm requires least.(5) Forestry provides suitable employment for women and children.(6) The holders will have opportunities of contracting for roads, fences, drains, &amp;c, and of hiring out their horses and carts on remunerative terms.We think that these small holdings should, in the first instance, be equipped with the necessary buildings at the expense of the State, that they should be of a size sufficient to keep the families in food, including milk, and to provide them with work during the periods when they are not required for forest labour. They should vary in size, so that some may be large enough to keep a horse for forest work and assist in the agricultural work on the other holdings, while others consist merely of a house with garden and grazing for a cow. The object of the Forest Authority should be to create as soon as possible an independent body of workers attached by habit and interest to forest work. It should, therefore, be made possible for the forest worker to acquire his holding at easy rates and become an occupying owner.or holder under crofter or other tenure should he be so inclined.In pointing out the dependence of forestry operations in mountain districts on the labour supplied from small holdings, we wish to emphasise equally strongly the dependence of the latter on forestry as a subsidiary industry in these districts. In the absence of other sources of employment, as in the congested districts of Ireland and Scotland, small holdings not only prove an economic failure, but have in some cases formed centres of poverty and distress, necessitating the employment of State depart-ments and the expenditure of large sums of public money for the provision of rebel In the Report of the Royal Commission on Congestion in Ireland, published in 1908, the Commissioners make the following statement, &quot; in very many districts the people
* See pages 65-68.D 3&quot; cannot live on the produce of the land, but have to depend very largely upon &quot; secondary sources of income of an uncertain and varying nature. They pay rent &quot; for a holding not so much for its agricultural value as because it furnishes a home &quot; for their family.&quot; A recent enquiry, conducted by Mr. Bryner Jones, Agricultural Commissioner for Wales, also indicates that the economic position of the average small farmer in the poorer hill districts of Wales is far from satisfactory. The earnings of tenants over the whole of one district investigated, and part of another, allowing for the value of farm produce consumed at home, ranged from 13s. Qd. to 21s. 6d. per week.Such instances prove the desirability in all, and the necessity in most, districts of inaugurating afforestation either before or simultaneously with the creation of small holdings, and we consider it should be the duty of the Forest Authority to earmark lands suitable for small holdings on any areas they might acquire, the number of such holdings being increased as the expansion of the forest requires.Increase of National Wealth. We shall investigate below&apos;* so far as it can be investigated while so many factors are uncertain the question, how far the planting of waste land is likely to prove directly profitable. WTe submit that this aspect of afforestation, though much discussed in this country, is not from a national point of view the most important, and that it has never been so regarded in the countries where silviculture has been longest practised and is most valued. The direct gain or loss is relatively a small matter compared with the new values created-these values being expressed partly in terms of population, and partly in terms of wealth. It is on such values that the strength of nations depends. In order to increase them it has long been the custom for the State in other countries to expend very large-sums of public money, either in planting for itself or in encouraging public bodies and private persons to plant. In some cases, as in the afforestation of the Landes in France, the sands and heaths in Denmark, and the high moors of Belgium, the hope of direct profit is very remote; but the fact that areas hitherto valueless have been rendered permanently habitable and productive is held to justify the initial cost, even though it may not be wholly recovered. The construction of forests is regarded in the same light as the construction of roads, bridges, breakwaters, &amp;c.? which are of definite national value, though the capital sunk in them may produce no direct return and cannot be recovered. Happily, in this country there lies between us and such difficult and costly problems a vast area of good forest soil where the results of afforestation, direct and indirect, promise to be far more encouraging.
PART 2-FOREST POLICY RECOMMENDED.V.-INTRODUCTION.The preceding chapters have established the facts that the timber position at home is bad, that prospects of supply from abroad are becoming doubtful, that ample supplies in times of emergency are a national necessity of the very first importance, that they can only be secured for certain if the timber be grown at home, and finally that it is essential for the State to take a very much more active part in forestry than it has been content to take in the past. We have now to consider the policy which should be adopted in order to deal with this grave situation.The State in Relation to Forestry and Agriculture.There is fortunately a very considerable amount of land in these islands not only suitable for timber growing, but more suitable for growing timber than for any other purpose of public utility. Part of the land is already under woodland,&quot;which is capable of very great improvement, while part is bare land used for grazing. We have therefore considered how far it is necessary to require the owners or holders to make the best use. of both types of land for timber growing. We have been helped in considering this problem by the Interim Report of the Agricultural Policy Sub-Committee,&quot;5 which deals with a similar problem from the point of view of food production. They have recommended that maximum agricultural utilisation shall be secured from all land which is more suitable for agriculture than for any other economic purpose, and in order to provide that this high standard of land utilisation shall be conducted on a reasonable basis of profit to those engaged in it, they have also recommended that minimum prices for certain standard crops should be guaranteed, as well as fair wages and conditions to agricultural workers. Their policy is based on the assumption that its establishment will induce owners and occupiers to bring the land which they control into maximum productivity, but if after full notice they neglect to do so it is recommended that the land should be temporarily taken over from the owner by the State without payment of rent, and that the profits which may be made should be handed back to him.. . We have considered whether this procedure, though applicable to agriculture, can properly be applied to forestry, and have come to the conclusion that it cannot. The general aim must be the same increased home production but the conditions are so different that the methods of procedure must also differ. In agriculture conditions can be so fixed as to ensure the earning of fair profits from any particular method of soil utilisation, within a few years, with a reasonable degree of certainty. The profitableness of forestry depends largely upon conditions and factors which it is quite impossible to fix in advance. The chief of these is the current rate of interest on money prevailing in the period between planting and final felling. Let us take as an example a timber crop 70 years old growing on land worth 3s. an acre which it cost 5Z. per acre to plant. A price of 74L per acre will suffice to repay the outlay on a 3 per cent, basis, but on a basis of 5 per cent. 2401. will be required. This illustra-tion shows sufficiently clearly the difficulty of applying the system of guaranteed minimum prices to forestry, and, even if it were possible to work out a system under which prices would vary according to the variations of the bank rate, the long delay of the return from forestry as compared to agriculture constitutes a fundamental difference between the two industries. For though it may be reasonable enough to require a man to do that which will in all probability bring him profit, he cannot reasonably be required to do that which normally will only bring a return to his successors. In another aspect, moreover, the forestry problem differs from the agri-cultural. The Committee on Agriculture recommend the greatest possible increased production by an industry already universally established, and being confident that whatever increase of production is achieved must be for the national benefit they do not attempt to define the exact degree of production which would ensure national safety. We, on the other hand, have to consider the development of an industry hardly yet established on a commercial scale, and we naturally aim first at developing it up to the point at which safety is secured. We find that it is possible to say with some degree of exactness what growth of timber in this country would at our present level of consumption make us independent of overseas supplies for a stated period.* Cd. 8506.
This being so, the situation, confronting us can be approached as a problem of insurance against emergency, and the steps necessary to secure adequate insurance can be proceeded with, without necessarily embarking on a general policy of afforesting all afforestable land.Both of these differences in the conditions of forestry and agriculture seem to us to point in the same direction. If the forestry problem is one of national insurance, of which the State is not justified in requiring private individuals to bear the burden, it follows that the. State must itself bear it. The State is justified in requiring the land belonging to private individuals to be used in any manner which makes for national safety; it is entitled to see that the most suitable land is so used ; but as the question of return which the land will give in national safety and not the question of return on money invested is the primary criterion which will determine its use, the State itself must be prepared to take the main risk of profit or loss. When, therefore, land is taken and planted by the State the returns must also go to the State, and the individual must be given a fair rent or purchase price based on the present value of his land. &apos; [Though we think it necessary that a definite scheme of national insurance with regard to timber supplies shall at once be undertaken by the State, this does not imply that the sole means of afforestation must be by direct State action upon land leased or purchased for that purpose. Such woods as we have in the United Kingdom we owe almost entirely to private, and in a few recent cases to municipal enterprise. The whole nation owes a great debt of gratitude to those who have planted in the past, often without hope of profit, still more often without any realisation of it. Their action has proved of ever increasing, and latterly of most vital, assistance to the nation in the present emergency. These men and their successors cannot, as we have explained, fairly be forced.to afforest their lands ; they can hardly indeed be expected to do so under the present conditions of high rates of return on money invested. But they can properly and rightly be encouraged to do so by financial assistance in planting, and by a steady effort to secure the best conditions as regards production and disposal of timber, so that the best prospect may be held out of a reasonable return on their enterprise. We feel certain that there will be a ready response to encouragement of this kind, and that it will be well worth while for the State to incur expenditure upon it in order that the national task may be shared as widely as possible.Two Aspects of the Forestry Problem.^ The problem of increasing home supplies falls naturally into two parts:-(1) The improvement of existing woods, which includes the replanting of areasfelled during the war ; and (2) The afforestation of land which is now bare.It will be necessary, as we show below, to solve both parts of the problem if the scheme of insurance which we have proposed is to be placed on a sound basis.We have first to consider what contribution can rightly be expected from our existing woodlands. At the time of writing (April 1917) it is impossible to foresee how far the war fellings of timber will be carried, but it is already certain that we shall have to face a period in which production will be much below even the low figure which it had reached before the war.* Not only have mature crops been felled in all parts of the United Kingdom, but thousands of acres of young or immature woods have been felled for pitwood and other purposes, or have been thinned to a degree which renders clearing and replanting absolutely essential. While it is possible that the annual yield of hardwoods especially oak of second quality may be maintained at its present level, the yield of coniferous woods is likely to be reduced during the next half century to a figure much below the pre-war output.It is natural to inquire, before estimating what area of bare land should be afforested, whether the existing woods could not be made to provide, under proper management, a sufficient stock of timber to meet periods of national emergency.- We have considered this question very carefully and have come definitely to the conclusion that they cannot. It is true that the existing area of woodland, which was returned at 3,043,000 acres before the war, was estimated to be producing only 15 cubic feet per acre per annum, or less than one half of. the amount of timber which it was capable of producing. The area includes, however; shelter belts, spinneys, ornamental and park timber and areas on groundI.. * The Government has recently placed the control of timber supplies under a new Directorate of :the War Office with a view to increasing feelings to a point which will render importation of timber unnecessary.D 4
above-the limit of- commercial production, on bog, swamp and other unproductive surfaces. We have found it impossible to visualise any practical scheme which would succeed in bringing and maintaining such areas, which may amount to one million acres, in the aggregate, under effective production. There remain perhaps 2,000,000 acres which, though freer from the above objection from the point of view of forest management, are still bound up to a considerable extent with property of other kinds. The problem of bringing woods in private ownership to a uniform state of high productivity has not yet been satisfactorily solved though many countries have attacked it energetically. We think, therefore, that any effective scheme for the intensive management of British woods would necessarily have to be based on State purchase and owing mainly to the high value of much of the land now under timber, and its close admixture with land used for other purposes, which makes severance a difficult matter, State purchase of existing woods must lead to far greater outlay than is contemplated under the schemes of afforestation which we recommend. We are hopeful that the production from British woods will ultimately be increased consider-ably, but we feel justified, as explained on p. 33, in counting on such increase only to the extent that it may meet the automatic increase which will have taken place in our requirements by the time that the woods have recovered from the war fellings now being made.The replanting of felled areas must, however, clearly be attended to from the first, and our whole policy rests on the assumption that this will be done. It is indeed with regard to replanting that there is the nearest approach of similarity of conditions between forestry and agriculture. We discuss the matter in detail below (p. 46), and give reasons for our belief that it would not be reasonable at once to require all areas felled during the war to be replanted. On the contrary, we think it right that those who will replant or turn waste or devastated areas into scientifically treated forests should for a certain period receive assistance similar to that which is offered to those who are willing to undertake fresh planting. But if land which has been timbered be not re-planted during the period in which the State is willing to assist, and be not used for any more useful public purpose, it will, we believe, be not only justifiable but right for the State to require its replanting under proper conditions, quite apart from the general scheme of insurance. The same thing applies to areas nominally timbered which are not producing anything like a full yield. With regard to both, the State may fairly expect that they shall grow, under proper silvicultural conditions, the crops which it is known that they are capable of producing.We proceed in the following sections to determine first the additional area which must be afforested in the interests of national safety and to compare it with the area available, and then to consider the best means of supplying our needs.VI. AREAS.1. The Area of Forest necessary to meet our Timber Requirements.The calculation of the area that should be afforested would be easy enough if we could proceed upon the two simple postulates that what we now consume we shall continue to consume, and that safety can only be secured by making this country self-supporting for an indefinite period. Both, however, require examination. The amount of timber consumed has, as we have shown, steadily increased more rapidly than the population, and we expect this increase to continue, though probably at a less rapid rate. This is all that can be said with anything like certainty about any period so far ahead as the period at which we could under any con-ceivable circumstances be self-supporting. It is vain to speculate whether war will require more or less timber than it does now or than is required in peace time, whether power will be produced without coal mines and their consumption of pit-props, locomotion be possible without railways and their consumption of sleepers, and paper-makers cease to consume woodpulp. We know that in all these departments consumption is increasing, and we must assume that civilisation will continue to be equally dependent on timber. We must be content, in setting before ourselves the aim of British forestry, simply to base our calculations on the present increasing consumption. It is not necessary, however, in order to be reasonably safe&apos; ^ in time of emergency that each year&apos;s normal crop shall equal eachyear&apos;s consumption. Timber stores itself. This is not true without qualification, for if the timber is left-standing too long it decays ; but felling can be so arranged that trees are normally left standing beyond the age at which they first come to maturity, so that in time of
Grand total conifers and hardwoods -        -        - 638,000,000* The following factors have been taken in converting quantities extracted from Board of Trade returns to the equivalents of standing timber : 1 load hewn softwood timber =   50 i 1   ,,   pit props -      -      - =   501 ,,   hardwood timber - =   40-       1 ,,   sawn or split   - .&apos; - -   601 ton pulp of wood   - - s 100 ju  4656f Cubic feet standing timber.Eemergency several times the normal annual cutting of mature timber may be made without seriously crippling the forests&apos; powers of producing a steady yield of mature timber. In the same way fellings may be regulated in the case of immature timber. Luckily, the relative amounts of large and small timber (including pulpwood) at present consumed in this country correspond approximately with the proportions in which they are produced in properly grown forests. We have then only to consider within what limits the forests can be made storehouses against periods of emergency, and the probable duration of such periods in the future. We have come to the conclusion that, taking account of the labour and plant that might be made available for a rapid expansion in production as well as of the actual supply of timber, five times the normal supply might be cut each year during any period of emergency which did not exceed three years. For timber grown on an 80-years rotation this means, if it is safe to assume that an emergency would not exceed three years, that an area one-fifth as great as would make us permanently self-supporting would give us reasonable security.The required area may be met from two sources from land already under woods and from land to be afforested. We think that our existing woods at the best may be made to produce an additional 60,000,000 cubic feet per annum of coniferous timber when they have fully recovered from the effects of the war fellings, which may be in 60 years. Before the war our consumption of timber was increasing at the rate of about 5,000,000 cubic feet per annum, and in 60 years, if the rate of increase were maintained,&apos; the consumption would be 300,000,000 cubic feet above the present level. These figures are, of course, conjectural, but the considera-tions which they involve have led us to the conclusion that it would be wise to off-set any probable increase in the production from existing woods against the probable increase in consumption and to afforest an area which will produce on the scale of emergency fellings referred to above, an amount of timber equal to our present imports.These imports reach our markets partly in a rough unmanufactured state, but also in various grades of manufacture, the tendency of recent years being for the more highly manufactured materials to increase at the expense of the unmanufactured. It is necessary, therefore, in estimating the area of forest required to replace such of the imports, as can be produced at home to use different factors for converting the various grades of imports into the equivalent of growing timber.&apos;::J We have investi-gated the average annual imports for the years 1909-13 inclusive in this way. It is not possible to set out the position with very great precision, but we believe that the figures stated below give a fair presentation of the case : Table showing the Average Annual Amount of Imports of Wood and Timber and Pidp of Wood (calculated as Growing Grops) which could be grown in the United Kingdom.Conifers.Unconverted timber  Cub. feet.        Cub. feet.Hewn, pit-props, &amp;c. - - 175,000,000 Converted timber Sawn, split, planed, sleepers, &amp;c. 360,000,000 Pulp of wood       -        -        -       85,000,000Total conifers        - 620,000,000Hardwoods.Unconverted (oak, &amp;c, unenume-rated, but not teak)      -        -       10,000,000 Converted -        -   . -        8,000,000Total hardwoods     --       -       -       18,000,000
We have now to translate these figures, both for conifers and hardwoods, into area. If we can determine the average annual yield per acre of afforested land in clear fellings and thinnings, we shall be able to state the required area.Conifers.Area to be afforested-We estimate the yield for conifers at 70 cubic feet (of which 40 cubic feet is large timber and 30 cubic feet pitwood and pulpwood) per annum per acre of afforested land. The area to be afforested is, therefore, ascertained by dividing 620,000,000, the number of cubic feet imported, by 70 to obtain the number of acres necessary for its production, and dividing further by 5 to arrive at the minimum area which would make us self-supporting during a three years&apos; war., The answer is 1,770,000 acres. This area, as we have explained, is additional to. the area of existing woods. ...     :It may be said, &quot;Why assume that we may have to depend; wholly on our own resources for three years ? &quot; The reply is that we do not assume that all imports would cease, but only that as timber bulks very large for its value, our national strength would be enormously increased if we were able to dispense altogether with its importation in favour of articles which had a greater value for less bulk.Our estimate has not yet taken into account the factor of time as having importance in this problem. We have answered the question, &quot; What area on the basis of present consumption will be necessary in order to avoid importation for a reasonable period ? &quot; but not the question, &quot; At what rate is it possible to plant in order to reach a point of reasonable safety in the shortest time ? &quot;Rate of Planting. The rotation of coniferous timber which would give such a margin of mature trees as would enable 15 years&apos; normal cuttings to be obtained in three years is, as we have said, on an average about 80 years. If the problem be regarded purely from the silvicultural point of view, it would be reasonable to plant up the area at an even pace, so that half would be planted in 40 years, and the whole not until the full rotation for the trees first planted had elapsed. But it is compatible with sound principles of forestry to plant a series of large areas much more rapidly without giving rise to serious fluctuations, either in the amount of timber produced, or in the number of persons employed. We consider it legitimate, bearing all the necessary factors of the case in mind, to aim at planting two-thirds of the required area in half the time of the full average rotation. This means planting 1,180,000 acres of conifers in 40 years. We think that this should be the practical objective which the State should keep in mind. At the end of this period a revised judgment can be formed of the dependence of this country upon timber, of the probability and conditions of future periods of emergency, and of the special demands that they may make upon our supplies. After this period, also, it will be possible to state with greater certainty the probable yield of timber from the land then afforested, and still to be afforested.No shorter view, however, than this would it be prudent to take. It may be argued that there may be such revolutions in industrial processes that wood will become imnecessary, both in war and- in peace; there may be such a revolution in human nature that wars or trade boycotts between nations will become inconceivable. There may be climatic or other natural changes which will either make the areas which are now afforestable unsuited for timber growing, or less valuable to the State for timber than for some other purpose which as- yet we cannot imagine. We regard all these possibilities as very unlikely to happen in forty years, and we therefore cannot too strongly emphasise our conviction of the necessity for steady, progress upon a definite plan for at least that time.Upon the basis then of planting 1,180,000 acres in 40 years, we have now to consider what should be the programme for the first 10 years. The arithmetical share for any decennial period would be 295,000 acres. - In view, however, of the fact that the Forest Authority which will be charged with the execution of the work must of necessity proceed cautiously during the earlier years of the scheme when it will be developing its machinery and adjusting its methods, we consider that the State should not count on securing the afforestation of more than 200,000 acres in the first ten years, exclusive of such replanting as maybe carried out under the system to which we refer below.   This we estimate may amount to about -50,000 acres, but, as we have
stated, replanting should not be reckoned in the forty-years&apos; total. Towards that total, then, 200,000 acres should be afforested in the first ten years, leaving rather more than 320,000 to be undertaken in each of the second, third, and fourth decades.Hardwoods.We have now to consider the question of hardwood supplies. Proceeding on the same argument as that adopted for coniferous timber, we find that the average annual imports for the five years 1909-13 were 18,000,000 cubic feet. It is reasonable to allow a production of 35 cubic feet per acre per annum for hardwoods, and if we may reckon on making five of the normal annual cuts for each year of emergency, the area which should be afforested is 18,000,000 divided by 35 and divided again by 5, or approximately 100,000 acres. The question of providing this area, however, stands on a different footing from the conifer question. Hardwoods as a general rule require a much more fertile soil than conifers, and apart from the area which is already under wood, there is little land save that devoted to agriculture which is really suitable for the purpose. A certain amount of hardwoods must always be grown in connection with extensive conifer areas for silvicultural and forest protection purposes, but the amount of first-class hardwood timber likely to be produced in this way will be relatively small. It must also be borne in mind that it is at preseni much more remunerative to grow conifers than hardwoods, owing to the more rapid growth of the former and the shorter time taken to reach maturity. The natural result is that private owners are gradually replacing hardwoods with conifers, and the actual amount of hardwoods replanted is practically negligible. The importance of a proper supply of hardwoods is apt to be overshadowed by the magnitude of our requirements in soft woods. This, however, is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs, as hardwoods are required for certain purposes for which conifers cannot be used.The chief way which we can see out of the difficulty is that the State should acquire woods, and especially devastated woods (to which we refer below), and manage them as far as possible for hardwood production. If the hardwood plantations were managed on an average rotation of 100 years it would be necessary to replant normally 10,000 acres in the first 10-year period, and we think that the State should observe that this quantity, at least, is secured, either by replanting devastated woods or by planting hardwood species also in the areas devoted mainly to conifers. We are unable to make a close estimate of the area of devastated woods which the State should acquire and hold for this purpose, but think that about 20,000 acres for the first decade will meet the necessity of the Case.We make further recommendations on p. 48 as to replanting felled areas with hardwoods.Hedgerow Timber. It is convenient at this stage to deal with hedgerow timber, which furnishes almost the whole of the elm timber used in this country and a considerable quantity of oak and ash. It is doubtful whether the supply from this source can be materially increased, but in any case hedgerow timber is so closely concerned with agriculture that we feel it should be left outside the sphere of an authority dealing exclusively with forestry. The growing of hedgerow timber is an old tradition in the country, and we are of opinion that while the Forest Authority should give advice if required, any questions of encouraging this form of silviculture should be left to the Agricultural Departments.2. Areas available for Afforestation Purposes.Thus far we have said nothing about the area of land in the United Kingdom available and suitable for afforestation purposes. We propose, in the first place, that no land which is arable, or can be reclaimed for permanent agricultural purposes, should be planted; in fact, we hope that as planting progresses and the need for small holdings in the neighbourhood of the forests increases, much land which is now too isolated to be put to immediate agricultural use will be brought under agricultural cultivation, so that forestry will increase rather than decrease arable cultivation.From the report of the Coast Erosion Commission we have taken the table below. Owing to the strain which the war has placed on public departments, it has not been possible to have the figures revised.E 2

On deducting all the land above 1,500 feet, above which elevation there is assumed to be practically no plantable land, there remain 12,784,480 acres (of which 9,957,878 acres are in Scotland) available for the selection of planting land. On the basis of a rough survey of Lanarkshire, where 50 per cent, of the land under 1,000 feet elevation was reported afforestable, the Commission assumed that 5,000,000 acres would be plantable in Scotland alone. To this area is. added 1,000,000 acres of poor tillage land, which, it was considered, would be more profitable under forest, making 6,000,000 acres in all for Scotland. It was further assumed for England and Wales that of the total area of 2,826,602 acres o  &quot;mountain and heath land &quot; lying below 1,500 feet 1,500,000 acres were afforestable; adding a further 1,000,000 acres of poor tillage, the total for England and Wales thus becomes 2,500,000 acres. The area of afforestable land in Ireland was placed at 500,000 acres, and the total area for the United Kingdom consequently at 9,000,000 acres.In view of what we have said above, it is necessary to deduct at once from this estimate of 9,000,000 acres the 2,000,000 acres of poor tillage which are included, but apart from this we believe that the estimate, except as regards Ireland, is too optimistic.We give below the results of some surveys conducted by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries during the last two or three years, from which it will be seen that in the large areas surveyed the proportion of land found to be afforestable ranged from 98 per cent, in Dorset and Hants to 25 per cent, in the Rhayader district of Mid Wales. In the latter case the percentage would have been approximately 50 if land above the 1,500 ft. contour line had been excluded.Approximate Results of Surveys conducted by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.District.Total Area of Uncultivated Land surveyed.Area of Afforestable Land disclosed.Percentage of Total Area Afforestable.I.

Commons and Forestry.On reference to the table on p. 36 it will be seen that the estimated area of Commons and Common Fields in England and Wales amounts to 2,632,772 acres. Much of this land is of too poor a character to be used for tillage, but a large area is suitable for growing timber and should be devoted to that purpose, if proper and equitable provision could be made for the preservation and adjustment of com-moners&apos; rights. One of our members, who has a close knowledge of the Welsh commons, is of opinion that afforestation presents the sole means of bringing them into a state of increased production and public utility. There are also extensive commons in the South of England which now produce very little, but are well adapted for growing coniferous timber, and at the same time increasing the general service which they render to the locality.We are aware that for various reasons objection may be taken to the enclosure of commons, but chiefly, perhaps, on the grounds that the public will be deprived of access and that small holders will be deprived of part of their means of livelihood. We believe that both objections are ill-founded. In the early stages of a plantation it is necessary to protect the young trees against damage, but there is no reason why woods should remain enclosed indefinitely. Afforestation can be carried on gradually, and it should not be difficult to arrange that the public should always have access to an area sufficient for its needs.The Crown Woods in the Windsor and Ascot districts may be given as instances of woods growing on land which was formerly heath and subject to rights of common.. In the. present emergency they have produced very large quantities of timber and pitwood, their utility in this respect being in striking contrast with the large areas of similar but unplanted heath land in various parts of the South of England. In normal times the woods are a favourite haunt of the public.With regard to the possible ill-effect on small holders, we desire to point out that the afforestation of commons and the utilisation in due course of the timber willE nSurveys of 81,000 acres of mountain land carried out by the Irish. Department showed 44,250 acres, or 57 per cent., to be plantable. In three areas actually purchased the percentage varied from 50 to 99 per cent.For Scotland, the surveys conducted by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland have not been worked out on a percentage basis; but the survey of Glen Mor, which was carried out by the Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society, showed that from one fourth to one fifth of the total area of land affected by the surveys was plantable. With regard to other extensive areas, mainly in the West of Scotland, one of our members who has made a close study of the subject has formed the opinion that 75 per cent, of the whole would prove to be actually plantable.These figures illustrate the extremely variable nature of rough grazing land from an afforestation point of view; but, generally speaking, the higher percentages are obtained on the flat, sandy heath lands, and hilly country, while in the mountainous districts the deductions which have to be made on account of peaty soil, even at low elevations, rocky surfaces and exposed positions, reduce the proportion of afforestable land very materially, even when the proportion is-worked out on a comparatively low upper limit of elevation. As the greater part of the waste land is actually situated in mountainous districts, we think that when a survey of the whole of the United Kingdom has been completed, it may be found that the total area of afforestable land in the United Kingdom is between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 acres. This estimate includes commonable land to which reference is made below.The outstanding fact, however, is that after allowing a very ample margin there still remains from two to three times as much afforestable land as is required to meet our scheme to afforest 1.770,000 acres in 80 years.There is one other point to which we desire to draw attention in this connection. For the purposes of our estimate it is necessary to make a definite assumption as to the proportions in which afforestable and unplantable land will be obtained on the areas acquired by the State for afforestation purposes. In view of the wide powers of selection which the State will be able to exercise in choosing areas during the earlier stages of its afforestation operations, we have come to the conclusion that it is not unreasonable to place the proportion at two-thirds afforestable to one-third n on -afforestable, and we have employed these figures in the discussion which follows.
provide the small holder with a steady source of employment. As we point out on p. 28 small holders and forests can be made of mutual advantage. -The experience of other countries, and of France in particular, where the question has been particularly difficult, shows that it is possible to adjust the varying interests in such a way that no hardship is inflicted on the commoners while rendering-scientific forest management possible. It should be possible, for instance, to arrange that while the worst land for grazing purposes was taken for planting, the best was improved as a common grazing ground.Under present conditions, however, it is rarely possible to acquire commonable land by agreement, and although the Development Act provides a means of com-pulsory acquisition, the present procedure is cumbrous and not wmolly satisfactory. We believe that equitable and more expeditious machinery could be devised, and are glad to see that the Sub-Committee on Agricultural Policy has already recommended that the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries shall appoint&apos;5&quot; a Departmental Committee to consider the whole question of dealing with commons. We are in agreement writh the recommendation, and, believing that it will often be easier to adjust existing rights to the use of commons for timber production than as enclosed agricultural land, we consider that the question of how best to make commons of use in afforestation should be carefully considered by the proposed Committee.3. Distribution of Areas in Afforestation.We do not propose to attempt to allocate between England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland the relative amounts of land to be afforested out of the total area to be undertaken. This is a problem with which the Forest Authority will be in a better position to deal than ourselves when it has before it the more precise data which a complete forestry survey will provide. But as our arguments for afforestation have centred chiefly round the defence question, we think it advisable to review certain aspects of the case.It is clear that in time of emergency the nearer the growing wood is to the place where the converted timber is consumed, the less labour and transport required and the less the risk of delay. It appears certain also that the present large manufac-turing and coal-mining centres will continue to be the chief consumers of timber, and we are consequently led to the conclusion that, other things being equal, the forests should be as near to them as possible. The same argument applies to the require-ments of armies in the field ; in France one finds at the present time sawr-mills at work wherever there is a sufficient quantity of suitable timber within reasonable reach of the firing line. M. de Lesseux, writing in the Revue des Eaux et Forets, after studying the matter on the spot, draws special attention to the enormous amounts of timber used in modern military operations and the desirability of having sources of supply as close to the front as possible. He adds that from this point of view forests as a general policy should be distributed as evenly as possible over the country. This suggestion is deserving of considerable attention in its application to the United Kingdom. It is quite possible that in a future war, communication between Ireland and Britain might be interrupted for a considerable period, in which case timber could not be moved from one country where there happened to be a surplus to the other where it was required. In the same way land communication between Scotland and England is narrowed down to a zone less than 70 miles wide, which might be rendered untenable.Even in the present circumstances, if the bulk of the timber which is being sent from this country to France could be drawn from the sandy heath lands of which there is so large an area in East Anglia, Surrey, Hampshire and Dorset, there would be a very considerable saving both in land and sea transport.The great value that has been proved to attach to forests as important elements of defence during this war should also be kept in mind.We desire, therefore, to suggest that the forests should not be concentrated too much in one country or in a very limited number of districts, but that they should be distributed as evenly as the occurrence of suitable land permits. The initial outlay may be increased somewhat under this procedure, but it does not follow that a financial loss will be incurred thereby, as the timber will presumably be close to its point of utilisation and will thus have a higher value.* Para. 60, Cd. 8506.:
VII. METHODS OF SECURING AFFORESTATION AND REPLANTING.Having considered the areas which we believe it essential to afforest, and shown that no additional areas need be devoted to hardwoods, we have now to recommend methods of planting the required additional coniferous area. The area to be afforested is, as stated on p. 34 , 200,000 acres in the first ten years, and. to this must be added. 50,000 acres of replanting. Our attention has been concentrated upon the first ten years, partly because we believe that very much will depend upon starting the scheme upon the right lines, but partly because it is essential that when Parliament is asked to approve the adoption of an afforestation policy they shall be given some fair idea of the cost for the first decade, and shall be asked to give general approval to this cost being incurred. For only if the Authority is assured of having the necessary funds for a programme of at least ten years can it embark upon a steadily developing policy. We deal with this subject further on pp. 61-65 where we consider the corn-position and powers of the Authority. Here it is only necessary to point out that if any useful estimate of expenses for ten years is to be made, a close examination of methods and procedure is necessary.The question, then, which we set before ourselves, is how to plant 250,000 acres in the first ten years of the scheme.In view of the urgency and importance of the matter, we consider that the State should endeavour by direct action to afforest in the first ten years an area of not less than 150,000 acres of land to be purchased or leased for that purpose.The afforestation of the remaining 50,000 acres and the replanting of an equal area should be the work of local authorities and private individuals.We have naturally been impressed by the fact that almost the whole of the afforestable land is in the hands of private owners and is frequently bound up with other property in such a way that owners may not willingly part with the afforestable land alone, or at least may desire for sentimental or other reasons .to retain some interest in it. We have consequently been led to consider schemes of afforestation based on a system of partnership between the owner and the State, whereby in broad outline the owner would provide the land for planting and the local management, the State would provide the money for afforestation and the control of management, and the net proceeds would be divided on an equitable basis as they accrued. We think that this system might provide 25,000 acres in. the first ten years. The remaining 25,000 acres would be left to the direct action of local authorities and of private individuals with the assistance of the State and under conditions to be laid down by the Forest Authority questions which we consider in detail on pp. 42-46. This mode of afforestation will be checked during the first ten years by the necessity of replanting the large areas cleared during the war. In future decades the proportion afforested by private enterprise may well be larger.We may now summarise our proposals, as far as provision of coniferous timber is concerned, as follows : Total to be afforested in 80 years, 1,770,000 acres. Total to be afforested in first 40 years, 1,180,000 acres. .To be planted in first 10 years : (1) Afforestation  Acres.(a) By direct State action   - 150,000(b) By proceeds^sharing     - -     -    25,000(c) By local authorities and privateindividuals     -     -     -     -    25,000---     200,000 acres.(2) Replanting       -      -      -     -     -      -     -      50,000   ,,Total in first 10 years -     -      -     -     -     250,000   ,,1. Afforestation by the State.We have stated that at least 150,000 acres of the initial 250,000 should be planted up by direct State action. If we had thought that private enterprise would undertake more than the amount assigned to it above, we should have recommended that the operations of the State should be correspondingly reduced, but we are sure that the only way of making certain that the full area will actuallv be planted is for the
State itself to undertake boldly at least the area we have named. In this matter the State cannot stand aside and wait for private individuals to act; it must give a lead. It must risk its own money if there is to be any real prospect of private individuals risking theirs, and bold action by the State in the early stages, if it be as wisely directed as we hope it will be, will be the best means in the long run of securing the active co-operation of private owners. The returns from afforestation are distant, and even if there is every prospect that profits will accrue, they are long-delayed. But the State can afford to take long views, and when private owners become convinced that the long view is likely to be justified by results, they also may not be afraid to venture if the State gives a reasonable amount of encouragement. We do not believe that State afforestation means expensive and inefficient action. On the contrary, we have the long experience of all the countries in which forestry has reached a high pitch of development, and the promising methods of management in certain of the Crown woods of recent years, to prove the opposite. The success of forestry depends very largely upon the continuity of methods of treatment over long periods, and upon the systematic collection and analysis of data over Avell-defined areas and under varied conditions.   This is essentially work for the State.While we think that the greater part of the planting in the early years of the scheme.must be undertaken by direct State action, we do not think it at all essential that the same large proportion should be maintained for the whole period of afforestation or for the whole area to be afforested. The adjustment of the propor-tions of the work which will fall to the State and Local Authorities and private individuals respectively, will take time, and it is a matter about which no one can prophesy with any sort of certainty. But while there will be at no stage any sudden abandonment of the State&apos;s operations, we shall expect to see a gradual reduction in the scale of State planting as knowledge and experience of forestry increase and more specially-trained land agents and foresters become available for employment on private estates.-The Acquisition of Land.In our endeavour to make some reasonable estimate of the cost of the first ten years&apos; work, we proceed to consider the methods under which the State should secure the necessary land in advance of actual planting operations. In order to lay out the plantations to the best advantage it is very desirable that the order in which the various years&apos; plantings are to be made should be clearly defined for at least twenty years ahead, and preferably for a longer period, but it is quite unnecessary to disturb the present occupation of the actual land to be planted more than a year or so in advance. In fact, it is usually desirable that land to be planted in the winter shall be closely grazed until the end of the previous autumn, as the growth of herbage and the work of planting, and subsequently of cleaning the young trees, is thereby reduced. On the other hand, it is necessary to know at least four years in advance the actual area which is to be planted in any one year, since it will take from three to four years to raise plants of the right species and age. Apart from these general considera-tions there are five principles which should regulate the State&apos;s action in securing land : (1) Self-contained subjects (estates or farms) only should be acquired. (2) The greatest possible proportion of the land acquired should be suitable for actual afforestation.(3) There must be the certainty of being able to secure sufficient land in adistrict to form a silvicultural and administrative unit. (4) Subject to (3) as little land as possible should be acquired in advance ofactual planting operations. (5) Advantage should be taken of offers of whole estates which are particularlysuited for afforestation and can be obtained on advantageous terms bycash purchases.We desire to add, in explanation, that the first principle above is intended to do away with severance values as far as possible; the second, third, and fourth are designed, while giving the State sufficient latitude to carry on afforestation efficiently, to secure the application of the maximum proportion of the funds and energy available for afforestation to actual planting operations. With regard to the fifth principle, it is only necessary to point out that prompt purchase may often secure estates which are in the market at prices well below a valuation based on the normal number of years&apos; purchase of the rental.
Purchase-It is probable that, in the state of national finances that may be expected after the war, purchase of land outright will only be justifiable when it can be shown that land can be obtained on much more favourable terms by purchase than by any method of leasing. There is likely to be a fair number of such cases,, but. they .will be generally cases in which whole estates come into the market of such a size that they must be treated as complete units for afforestation purposes. This means that they should be planted up in not less than twenty years from the time they are acquired. Assuming this to be the average rate at which purchased land is planted, and that the area planted steadily increases year by year in an arithmetical progression, we have had a table compiled (see p. 103) to show the probable progress of the scheme, and there give fuller explanations of its working.Leasing. Proposals for State leasing of land for afforestation are new, and as far as we are aware have not been put into practice on a large scale, if at all, in any country ; but the method presents two great advantages for this nation in its present position, first, that the initial capital outlay per acre planted is Very greatly reduced as against purchase, and, secondly, that the area of land which must be held in advance of planting operations is very much smaller than has been estimated to be necessary in the case of purchase. A leasing scheme would probably be arranged so that occupation should be taken of farms on an estate as leases fall in, or under some similar arrangement convenient to owner, occupier, and Forest Authority, and under this scheme we may assume that in favourable cases the Authority would not find it necessary to lease land on the average more than four years in advance of planting. We have explained and illustrated the probable working of this system on pp. 103-104.The terms and periods of leases present some difficulty. Short of ownership a perpetual lease is the only really sound tenure for a forest. If a terminable lease be for any reason necessary it should not be for a less period than a whole rotation. But it; ought not to be impossible in the case of a lease for a definite period to give the owner the right of taking over the management of the land with the Authority&apos;s consent at any period when a satisfactory valuation could be made of the work done by the Authority such valuation being then paid by the owner to the Authority. Similarly, under a perpetual lease, the owner or his successor in title might be given a right of pre-emption at a valuation if the Authority thought it right to part with its interest in the land.Proportion between Leased and Purchased Areas. For the sake of making our estimate of expenditure, and after weighing to the best of our ability the considera-tions set out in the preceding sections, we have assumed that during the first, ten years of the scheme one-third of the land to be planted will be acquired by purchase and two-thirds by lease.With regard to the actual terms to be offered by the Authority to owners, though the Department controlling finance may find it desirable to fix a price beyond which the Authority should not normally go in respect of any agreements which may be made, we trust that in cases wrhere it may be obviously advantageous to exceed the limit laid down, no difficulties will be placed in the way of exceptional treatment provided that the proposed terms of sale or lease were such as would be arranged in ordinary transactions between individuals.In the case of leases, the criterion will be the assured normal value in use, but the Authority should have power to offer a moderate increase provided it can be shown that this does not exceed the actual market value. The margin is required in order to give the owner some inducement to change the occupation of his land and to meet cases where the land is known to be under-rented or where large blocks of land possess a special silvicultural value. Where it is impossible to arrange leases by voluntary agreement within these limits, the Authority will have to choose between dropping the negotiations and initiating compulsory proceedings.Compulsory Aquisition of Land. So far we have dealt both with purchase and leasing on the basis that the contracts between the individual and the Authority will be voluntary. We consider this a not unreasonable assumption to work upon so far as relates to the vast bulk of the land required in the early years of the scheme, when the Authority&apos;s power of selection will be great. But powers of compulsory acquisition must be given to the Authority from the first, so that its choice of land may be unfettered, and that no single unreasonable owner may hold up the development of a scheme that has been undertaken. We recommend that these powers of compulsory acquisition should include leasing as well as purchase.   ByTJ   4656 &apos;&apos; v
compulsory leasing we mean the power of the State to compensate the individual by an annual instead of a lump sum payment. So long as the annual payment were a fair equivalent of the lump sum which would be judged, no doubt, by the ability of the individual to raise that sum on the security of the annuity we do not see that this method of payment would be at all unfair.2. Afforestation by Local Authorities.Within comparatively recent times many large cities have become the owners of considerable tracts of land which serve as the catchment areas of their water supplies. Usually the areas are situated in mountainous districts where the rainfall is high and the topographical relief is sharp, the land being consequently fairly typical of that which we have in view as suitable for the production of coniferous timber. In any case manuring and consequently arable cultivation of any land suitable for the purpose is, for hygienic reasons, not permissible and the land may then be used for grazing, as the least objectionable form of agricultural utilisation, it may be allowed to run wild or finally it may, where suitable, be put under forest. Timber production is undoubtedly the most sanitary form of soil utilisation, while forest growth has the further advantages of tending to equalise the run-off in times of excessive rainfall or drought and of fixing the soil so that the amount of silt carried into the reservoirs is reduced to a minimum.Certain corporations, such as Manchester and Leeds and Liverpool, which by a proceeds-sharing arrangement with the Development Commission has undertaken to afforest 4,000 acres of its Lake Vyrnwy watershed in 20 years, have displayed con-siderable interest in planting, but much remains to be done in speeding up and systematizing the work generally.^We consider it should be an invariable rule that on catchment areas all land which will produce a crop of marketable timber should be afforested. Many of the corporations are still engaged in meeting the capital outlay which their water supply-systems necessitated, and for that reason are unwilling to place further burdens on the present for the benefit of future generations. We have little doubt that when the necessity of increasing our timber supplies has been explained to Local Authorities much greater activity in systematic planting will be displayed, but in cases where they are still unwilling or unable to plant without assistance Local Authorities should be eligible to receive all or any of the forms of assistance to which we refer below.We desire to point out finally that there are on the Continent many well-managed forests belonging to corporate bodies, and we see no reason why the example should not be followed in this country. The value of forests as recreation grounds in the neighbourhood of large towns is there generally recognised. Epping Forest is the only large woodland so available in this country. The Foret de Soignes near Brussels, though not a municipal forest, is a well-known example of a stretch of woodland attached to a large town. It is not a natural forest, but has been created by artificial means. The younger and denser woods were kept fenced, but the older woods were open. The shade in summer and protection from the cold winds in spring and autumn rendered this forest far more serviceable than an open park, while its use by the public in no way diminished the large and steady income which it brought in to the Government. A forest, in fact, is the only kind of recreation ground which may be made to pay its own way.3. Methods of Assisting Private and Municipal Afforestation.As we have already stated (p. 39), we rely upon two methods of promoting planting by private owners and Local Authorities to supplement direct action by the State.   We shall deal with them in order :(i) Proceeds-sharing.Under the schemes of proceeds-sharing, or co-partnership, which we recommend, the State would provide the cost of planting and general supervision and would lay down the working plan ; the landowner would provide the land and the cost of local management. Accounts would be kept of the annual contributions made by each party, and on the basis of these, reckoned up at compound, interest, the annual receipts*fc See Appendix 4.
would be divided. This method seems rather complicated, as the ratio determining the division- of proceeds would vary from year to year, but no doubt a simple method of crediting proceeds during the early years and arriving at a fair average ratio as the basis of calculation when the woods become fully productive could be mutually agreedupon. -The advantages of this method from the standpoint of the State are : (1) It would entail less expenditure on the part of the State than leasing or purchase.(2) It would be cheaper than grants or loans below the current rate of interest because, while the latter would entail an inevitable loss to the Treasury, there would, under co-partnership, be. no loss &quot;unless the plantations turned out unprofitable.(3) The experience and local knowledge possessed by private estates would be utilised.(4) The number of men in the direct employment of the State would be reduced without any corresponding reduction in the area of wood under . State control.The advantages from the landowner&apos;s standpoint are :-(1) He would retain possession of his land and his interest in the woods. (2) He would feel that the Forest Authority, with its wider experience and expert advice, was really at the back of the venture.   This would incline him to take a risk which he might otherwise consider unfair to his successors.The advantage of proceeds-sharing schemes would be most felt in districts where the proportion of plantable land was comparatively small, and complicated questions of wintering, sport, &amp;c, arose in connection with the occupation of the unplantable areas. Such questions, though ill-fitted for the decision of a tribunal, may be decided by agreement where both parties are desirous of seeing them settled. Land might, therefore, become available for planting under this system which could not be made available by purchase or leasing on account of the reluctance of the State to make itself responsible for the unplantable hinterland attached. A proposal on very similar lines was promulgated by the Development Commissioners in November 1914, but the war was then already in progress, and we think the absence of result was due to this fact rather than to any inherent defects in their scheme.It would be necessary under the scheme which we have outlined to give the Forest Authority power as a precautionary measure to take the woods over on reasonable terms if they were not managed according to their plan and on correct silvicultural principles, so as to avoid all risk of the money spent on planting being wasted.(ii) Assistance by Grants.Any system under which Local Authorities and private individuals may be asked to take their share in the national task which we have described involves financial assistance from the State. Before determining what form that assistance should take it may be well to consider the object aimed at and the principle on which assistance is to be based. ; ..The object aimed at is clearly the provision of an adequate reserve of timber as soon as possible, and at the least expense to the State. To -attain this object, it will be necessary, to render the interests of the owner of timber-pro-ducing land and those of the State as nearly identical as possible in respect of the areas for which grants are given. At the present time, these -interests are not identical, as the owner regards his timber, apart from sentimental or  esthetic reasons, as material which he can convert into cash at pleasure, while the State, from the point of view of national safety, requires a stock of timber to be maintained in the country. It is evident that these respective points of view can never.be entirely reconciled, but by State assistance in planting, combined with a clearly defined control over the crops until they approach maturity, an adequate proportion of mature timber may in time be maintained on private estates, which can be drawn upon as required in periods of emergency. &quot; .The principle ^on which assistance is justified may be defined as compensation for personal loss sustained-by the private owner in carrying out work which is essential to national security, and directly increases the national capital. In.theory, the growing of timber may not differ from the growing of agricultural crops, but, while the profit
derived irom the latter is obtained in a year or two, that from timber-growing is deferred too long for the planter reasonably to regard planting as a personal investment, and too uncertain as an investment for his successors.We are agreed that forestry in this country cannot be considered to be established on a satisfactory basis unless private landowners afforest the parts of their estates that are best adapted to timber production, and subsequently maintain their forests under correct silvicultural conditions, and we consider that the sooner systematic afforestation of this kind is undertaken the better. But we fear that conditions during the years following the war will not be favourable for large undertakings by private landowners. There will be very great uncertainty as to cost and availability of labour, the burdens of rating and taxation, and the tendency of legislation ; and this uncertainty will undoubtedly discourage owners from locking up their money in an enterprise such as forestry, which, once entered upon, must be steadily pursued, and will not produce a full return for about two generations. For these reasons we think it essential that the State should assist owners who are willing to afforest systematically.Basis of Assistance. We recommend that the basis upon which the assistance should be reckoned should be a grant of up to 27. an acre towards the cost of planting conifers, and up to 47. an acre towards the cost of planting approved hardwoods. This might either take the form of a direct grant in aid of planting or one or other of the following alternatives.Loans. We have considered the grant of a loan at such a rate of interest as will entail upon the State the same expense per acre as a grant of 21., and proceed to give an illustration of how this system would work out. If 57. per acre were advanced and the State were prepared to lose 21. an acre, and repayments did not begin till the 11th year and were spread evenly over the next 30 years, the annual repayment would be 6s. 5c7. per acre if borrowing were at 5 per cent., and 5s. 2d. at 4 per cent. For planters who had no money at their command this method would have obvious advantages. They would be put in possession of the funds necessary for planting, and would, in favourable cases, be able to meet the instalments out of the sale of thinnings. From the point of view of the State it would be unadvantageous because it involves the finding in the early years of the scheme of larger sums than the system of direct grants. If it is objected that loans at a rate lower than the current market rate tend to obscure the actual financial position, 27. of the sum advanced might be allocated as a grant and 37. as a loan at the current market rate. We think, however, that this alternative method of assistance should be made available and have included a sum in our estimates to meet the necessary expenditure.Relief from Public Burdens. We have also considered whether the assistance given should take the form of relief from rates and taxes during the early years of the forest&apos;s existence in which it is unproductive or Unprofitable, recoupment being made to the owner of his expenditure under these heads. This scheme may seem attractive, for the burden of rates and taxes has always been felt in the past as a serious deterrent to afforestation, and its relief in the future might be a corre-sponding encouragement. The general question of rates and taxes is dealt with on pp. 55-57, where we come to the conclusion that the burden on land such as should be planted under our scheme should not, under the present law, exceed 2s. per acre. An initial grant of 27. is equivalent to an annual payment on a 5 per cent, basis of 3s. 2d. for 20 years or 3s. V)d. for 15 years, and is, therefore, con-siderably more helpful than repayment of rates and taxes over those periods. As it is the less valuable and, consequently, the lowest burdened lands which we hope to bring under timber, we are inclined to think that landowners generally would make a bad bargain if they elected to have their rates and Schedule A. Income Tax recouped even for a period of 30 years rather than get an initial grant of 27. per acre.We believe, however, that there are likely to be cases in which, even though an owner may very likely lose in the long run, he may prefer some measure of recoupment of rates and taxes to the payment of any fixed grant. It ought not to be impossible to provide for.cases of this kind. The State will know.the rateable value of the land ,which it is proposed to afforest, and can make as good an estimate as any individual of the probable amount of these burdens. This means that an initial grant of 27 . per acre can be expressed in terms of an undertaking to repay rates and taxes for so many years. If the State made a fair calculation, taking an equal chance of a loss if burdens increased and of gain if they were reduced, such an arrangement would be fair
to both parties, and we see no reason why an owner who prefers the removal of uncertainty as to prospective burdens to any other form of aid from the State, should not have the option of taking the State&apos;s help in this form.Annual Payments. A further point has been suggested to us. It is that the 21. grant should be given in the form of an annual payment for a certain number of years, and not in a lump sum. If it were spread over 10 years, the rate of calculation being 5 per cent., the annual payment would be approximately 5s. 2d.; if over 15 years, 3s. 10d., and over 20 years, 3s. 2d. Such a method of payment would have the advantage to the State that it would decrease to a minimum the amount which would have to be found in the early years of the scheme, and that if the conditions under which the grant was made were departed from by the owner before the payments were completed, there would be a less sum to be recovered. Perhaps, also, the owner would feel himself under a more definite obligation to adhere to the conditions under which the grant was made if the payment for each area planted up were continuous over a considerable period of years, and were a dependable, if small, source of income in return for his expenses in planting. Some owners may indeed prefer, in view of the possibility of their property passing to a successor soon after planting, that all the expense of planting shall have fallen on themselves, and that the successor shall receive the grant during the years before the woods begin to bring in income, in a form which will replace the grazing rental, or the other income which the land would have been bringing in &apos; had it not been planted. The question is hardly one of principle, and may not have very much importance, but we are inclined to think that the Authority should be able to adopt this alternative method of payment.Conditions of Grant. We now consider the conditions which should be complied with in order to secure the grant.First, the area to be planted and the working plan must be approved by the Forest Authority, and adhered to, or only varied with its consent.Secondly, in order to avoid the trouble of having to deal with small areas, a minimum area should be planted at a minimum rate per annum. We do not wish to lay down a hard-and-fast rule in this matter and think that discretion should be left to the Authority, but we think in normal cases the grant should only be given if at least 100 acres are to be afforested, and at least 10 acres planted up each year. An area of this size when mature would provide sufficient timber to feed a portable saw-mill for about three years. The area to be afforested need not necessarily all be on one estate nor in a single block, and neighbouring owners might, if in co-operation they could guarantee to observe the conditions, combine to submit a single scheme.Thirdly, the Forest Authority must be satisfied that the planting and subsequent care of the trees will be under adequately skilled management.Fourthly, the recipient of the grant must be bound, if he diverts the land to other purposes than the growing of timber according to the conditions laid down, or in any other way breaks the conditions, to refund the grant he has received with interest at current rates. We have considered for how long these conditions should be attached to the planted area, and are of opinion that 30 years would be a reasonable period. After this period has elapsed the timber will have attained a certain value, so that the State&apos;s expenditure will not be without result, and, as the plantation will by that time be a going concern on correct economic and silvicultural principles, the risk of its being mismanaged will be slight. It is hardly necessary to add that until the 30 years have elapsed the liability for carrying out the conditions would be transferred to the new owner if the land were sold.Method of Payment. We think if the system of the block grant of 21. or 41. per acre is adopted, that 75 per cent, of the grant for the year&apos;s planting might be paid immediately on completion of the work, and the remaining 25 per cent, when beating up has been properly carried out, say, in four years&apos; time from the beginning of the planting.We have considered whether, in addition to the conditions detailed above, the State, in view of the initial grant, could reasonably impose upon the owner any liability with regard to the price at which his timber might subsequently be taken for State purposes. Considering, however, that the State is certain in any future emer-gency, as it has done in the present, to requisition timber and to refer the question of price to a Commission, we consider any such stipulation superfluous.Effect of Grants, Our consideration of this matter has served to emphasise in our minds both the weight of the obligation under which a private individual placesF 3
himself by accepting State assistance under the conditions which have been suggested^ and the extent of the advantage which the State receives in return for its expendi-ture, quite apart from any question of appropriating any special share of ultimate profits. This matter is worth, a little attention, for unless the true position be realised it may be argued that as it has pleased people to plant woods in the past, so it will probably continue to please them to plant in the future, and that a little State assistance or advice or regulation will make no great difference to one side Or the other, and that, therefore, the financial inducement to plant might well be dispensed with. In practice the conditions imposed, though making for a better commercial return from the woods in about two generations from the time of their planting, will be felt as imposing severe restrictions upon that freedom which an owner has hitherto enjoyed. The condition will in particular be found onerous that, if during the first 30 years from the time planting begins the working plan be departed from, the owner for the time being must repay the grant given by the State with compound interest at the rates which have ruled since the grant was made. It should be noted that as the planting of a block will often be spread Over 10 years, it may not be free from the condition for 40 years from the time planting was started. This condition, though applying only to a small portion of an estate, will restrict the freedom of sale of the whole, which is an important consideration, particularly during a period of heavy taxation and death duties. Possibilities of development of almost any piece of land are most uncertain, for there are fashions in land utilisation as in other tilings, and an owner in taking help from the State for planting may be fettering himself and his successors so that they are unable to take advantage of some good offer for their land, except by repaying to the Government a sum which, though it seemed inconsiderable when given, has by the workings of compound interest become most burdensome to repay.What, on the other side, will be the State&apos;s advantage ? For a grant which will recoup about one-third of the cost of planting, the State will have induced a private individual to embark upon an industry which may well mean for the State in the future the difference between safety and disaster, and will normally bring in no profit whatever during the lifetime of the man who receives the grant. We feel, indeed, on considering the whole question, that so far from the grants to owners being an unnecessary national expenditure, the nation will seldom have made -a. better investment.4. Replanting.The subject of replanting, including the proper treatment of areas clear-felled during and before the war, the treatment of devastated areas, and the more general question of. improving the productiveness of our existing timbered area, is a subject -of the greatest importance, and we have also found it a subject of difficulty.Areas felled during the War. Part of the difficulty is due to the impossibility of obtaining accurate data either as to the pre-war timbered area and its nature and yield, or the amount of fellings during the war and their yield. We understand that the statistics compiled before the war were, to a considerable extent, estimates on account of the unsatisfactory nature of the returns sent in; and unwillingness and apparent inability to supply returns have been shown by those who have during the war been asked to give returns of sales and fellings. It is a great pity that difficulties of this kind should occur in a matter upon which national policy and national safety-may depend, and we recommend that as soon as possible it should be made compulsory to render returns which may be asked for by the Forest Authority or any other -responsible department. The best estimate that we have been able to make is that up to date (April 1917) not more than 100,000 acres have been clear-felled during the war, though it seems possible that there may be a great speeding up of felling during - the next few months.Compulsory Replanting considered. We have given much consideration to the question whether it would he justifiable to require as an immediate and special measure the replanting of all areas felled during the war. On the one hand, it maybe urged that their having been timbered indicates that they are more suitable for being promptly re-timbered than for any other purpose; that prices have generally been secured which were very much higher than pre-war prices; that these prices often showed on a fair basis of calculation a reasonable profit on the expenses of planting and tending; and that, therefore, it would be fair to require replanting to be undertaken within a limited period of the restoration of peace.
On the other hand, it would he equally true to say that many owners have offered their timber for sale during the war from patriotic motives, or have felt themselves compelled to take low Government prices. In this way they have received for it very little more than its pre-war price and substantially less than its open market value, and that the prices received have not made good the losses previously incurred or brought in anything like a normal return on the money expended. It could also be argued that it would not be fair to place one particular class of producers under special conditions as to the future carrying on of their industry, particularly when they have had no warning that any such policy was in contemplation, and have consequently already expended the money received, frequently in paying off death duties or other burdens on their property. It is also no doubt true that in practice it would be found impossible to compel an owner to undertake heavy expenditure on replanting his land, and that the alternative of taking over the land would have to be resorted to. The result of this would be that the Forest Authority, in the early years of its existence, would find itself encumbered with the duty, in the first place, of forming numerous compulsory schemes as to replanting, and then of taking over numerous widely scattered areas, generally of small size, and replanting them with its own staff. The Authority would thus fritter away its energy on work which in the aggregate would make no very great contribution towards the task which lay before it, and begin its operations by antagonising those persons whose co-operation in extensive planting is essential.It is also well to remember that in many cases it would not be sound policy to attempt to replant immediately the bulk of the areas from which coniferous timber has recently been felled on account of the dangers from insect pests, to which we refer on p. 53.But though for practical reasons we think it would be unwise to employ immediate compulsory methods with references to the areas felled during the war, it is clear, as we have stated above, that the treatment of areas which have in the past been timbered will come prominently before the State when it is considering the general question whether an owner is making the best use of his land in the national interest. If land previously under timber is not being put&apos; to any better use, the onus will be upon the . owner to show why it should not be again used for timber, rather than upon the State to show that it should be devoted to this purpose. The owner, in fact, who is neglecting to replant must expect to have this fact taken as indicative of a general inability or unwillingness to have his land properly developed, and will have no right to complain if this involves further procedure. This may act as an indirect compul-sion to replant all the areas most suitable for replanting, and may in the long run be far more efficacious than any measure imposing upon the Authority a special duty to see that all recently felled areas are replanted within a limited time.Assistance for Replanting.We have also had to consider whether grants should be given to assist replanting, and if so, upon what scale. Two views can be held as to this with equal reason, according as different types of felled areas are envisaged.Clear-felled Areas. With regard to Avell-stocked areas recently clear-felled, planting will be cheaper than elsewhere, as they may be clear of growth, drained, fenced and free from rabbits, and because, as their timber-producing capacity will be exactly known, few mistakes will be made in replanting. For planting such areas it would be difficult to justify the same scale of grant as is recommended for taking up new ground.Devastated Areas. On the other hand, the land which most requires replanting is of quite another type. It is either woodland that has been devastated by the gradual . removal of all marketable timber and though still technically timbered will not produce, unless replanted, a good marketable crop, or land covered with scrub or coppice of next to no value, and in either case can be classed only as wrooded waste. Probably well over a million acres of ground nominally under timber in the United Kingdom is of this character. The importance of dealing with this large area, which at present represents a dead loss to the capital of the nation, cannot be lost sight of. In the first place, the situations and the soils are superior to those of mountain areas, and the potential yield capacity is consequently higher. In the second place, its transformation from non-productive to productive land involves no disturbance of any existing method, of utilisation. A third point is the probability of much of this land producing a greater proportion of hardwoods and large coniferous timber than the mountain areas, on
which most of the new plantations may he made. The cost of clearing, planting and protecting from ground game land of this class may vary from 61. to 10L per acre, and the subsequent cleaning of the young crop must be allowed for. In view of this heavy expenditure such land has been neglected and in many cases cannot be reclaimed without assistance..Grants recommended. After careful consideration, we desire to recommend that schemes of replanting land of whatever description should be considered by the Authority on the same basis and under the same conditions as schemes for planting fresh land. Each scheme, however, will have to be considered on its merits owing to the great variety in the conditions which prevail; and where the expense of replanting will be less than that of planting up a new area, the full grant of 21. (or 41. in the case of hardwoods) should not normally be given. There are, however, two necessary qualifications to this recommendation. In the first place, only schemes of replanting which are begun as soon as possible after the Authority is established, and carried through speedily and steadily, should qualify for grants. The grant will in this way be an encouragement to that speedy development of our timber supplies which we consider essential in the national interest. Secondly, the area of land on account of which a grant can be applied for may well be smaller in the case of replanting than in that of fresh planting. As before, we do not wish to lay down a hard-and-fast line, but we think that schemes of replanting might well be considered for grants if the area was of twenty acres or upwards.It will have been noticed that though we estimate the cost of properly regenerating scrub or waste lands as running up to twice as much as planting fresh land an estimate for which there is ample warrant we recommend only the same maximum grant as for fresh planting. It must be remembered, however, that the fresh land to be taken up for afforestation will normally be a source of. income until afforested, and that when afforested the source of income will disappear for many years. The waste and scrub land, on the other hand, which we have in view, though often rated, produces no income at all. Under these circumstances, and also for the sake of uniformity and simplicity, we have thought it right to advise that the maximum grant should be the same in both cases.VIII. FORESTRY IN RELATION TO EMPLOYMENT ANDFOOD SUPPLIES.1. Employment.This question was considered in detail by the Royal Commission on Coast Erosion and Afforestation, which took much evidence as to the amount of labour absorbed in afforestation and by forests in full working order, and also as to the suitability of the unemployed for planting operations. We are in general agreement with the conclusions of that Commission which are set out in paragraphs 32 to 80 of their Second Report.^ We desire to point out, however, that while the Commission kept prominently before them the relationship of afforestation to employment, our point of view throughout has been to secure supplies of timber in the interest of national safety. The two points of view are normally not incompatible, as we hope to show below, but national safety requires that planting operations should proceed steadily on an expanding scale, involving schemes which have been carefully thought out in advance, and that object could not be attained if afforestation came to be regarded merely as a reservoir capable of receiving from time to time large masses of unemployed labour pending the readjustment of normal conditions.We may consider the question from two points of view; first, the amount of work which will normally be provided from the time the land is first acquired for planting to the time the first woods are mature and the scheme is a going concern, and secondly, the possibility of rapidly expanding afforestation schemes to meet temporary unemployment due to depression of the labour market.Amount of labour required for Afforestation Operations. We have estimated that 51. 10s. will be expended per acre planted, exclusive of local supervision and equip-meht, and of that sum about 51. per acre will represent labour employed on raising plants, fencing, preparation of the groimd for planting and planting itself. For every 100 acres planted, therefore, 5001. will be spent in wages, representing a full year&apos;s
Wages for rather&apos; less than eight men. If the land were covered with birch or other scrub, as is sometimes the case with the best land in Scotland, the number required would be considerably greater. Part of the work of afforestation, namely, planting itself, is of such a character that it must be done in the winter months, and part, namely weeding plantations and nurseries, in the summer months ; but apart from these operations, the remaining work may be distributed as found most convenient over the year. It is this elasticity which makes afforestation dovetail so well with agricultural work. The actual permanent addition to the population of an estate in process of afforestation would consequently vary with the facilities for providing small holdings. Given an adequate number of holdings it should be possible to settle at once twelve instead of eight men on the soil for a scheme which involved the planting of 100 acres per annum. The additional labour required would increase but little during the first 15 to 20 years of planting, by which time from 1,500 to 2,000 acres would have been afforested and diverted from its former use. The number of men displaced in consequence from sheep farming would vary greatly according to the locality, but might amount on the average to two or three.The scheme of State afforestation which we recommend begins with the planting of 3,300 acres in the second year and works up to 30,000 acres in the tenth year. Assuming that on the average 10 men will be required for each scheme involving the planting of 100 acres per annum, the number of men permanently settled on the land would be 330 in the second year and 3,000 in the tenth year. These numbers are exclusive of supervision.Amount of Labour required after Plantations are established. Apart from the cleaning which the young trees require for two or three years after planting and occasional repairs to fences and drains, plantations need little attention until about the 15th j^ear, when quick-growing species may require a light thinning. From that time onwards the amount of labour employed will increase steadily as the plantations have to be thinned a second and a third time. The preparation of the thinnings for pit-props, roadmaking and the haulage of the material to rail will all absorb increasing amounts of labour. By the 25th year all these operations together with planting operations should be proceeding. By the 40th year it may be found advisable to begin on a small scale the clear felling of the first-planted areas. Timber large enough for sawing should begin to be produced about the 50th year, and by the 80th year the forest should be in full working order. It will then require about one man per 100 acres for felling, replanting, repairs to roads and miscellaneous work not including the conversion of the timber. The last-named operation should give employment to about the same number of men as the forest work itself.As our scheme provides for the ultimate afforestation of 1,770,000 acres it follows that the total amount of labour required for running the forests will be about 17,700 men. Allowing for the displacement from sheep-farming of 2,000 men at the outside, the net gain would be 15,700 men. If account be taken of the conversion and manu-facture of the timber produced the net gain is upwards of 33,000 men. If account be taken further of the labour which will be required to supply the wants of these forest workers we think it is not unreasonable to assume that the scheme would result ultimately in the settlement on the soil of not less than 25,000 families, or, on the basis of five persons per family, of 125,000 persons in all. We are of opinion that the increase of population under such healthy conditions and with continuity of steady employment would in itself be a national asset of no mean value.The Expansion of Afforestation Operations to meet Periods of Unemployment.  As we have already indicated, we desire to see the afforestation scheme which we recommend carried forward steadily on a set plan, but it is possible to expand planting operations for a limited period without seriously upsetting the general arrangement of the work. For instance, the area to be planted could be doubled for three or four years, provided the right kinds of plants were available. Roads could also be constructed in advance of the time when they were actually required, though this would be an uneconomic proceeding. If, however, the forestry industry is to be conducted on a sound basis the extent to which it can be called upon to find employment in periods of general trade depression must be strictly limited.Settlement of Disbanded Soldiers.-Th.Q number of disbanded soldiers who can be permanently settled under this scheme is limited by its gradually expanding character, and will depend largely on the date on which the scheme is initiated and the period during which the men are disbanded. We have assumed that the Government will initiate the scheme without waiting for the end of the war, and that the first year willO   4(!5G a.
have elapsed before large numbers of men are disbanded, and possibly also the second and third, before complete demobilisation has been effected. The number of men required in the second year is 330, in the third year it will be 670, and in the fourth year 1,000 ; in the tenth year it will be 3,000. There is no reason why all these men should not be obtained from the disbanded troops, and we believe that the impetus which our scheme will give to private planting will provide permanent employment for considerably larger numbers than before the war.Although afforestation work should be very suitable for soldiers, our scheme has not been worked out with that object, but with a view to the larger issue of national safety. If it is desired to make more rapid provision for land settlement than is provided by our scheme, there would be no special difficulty in so doing, though rapid expansion would be accompanied by greater risk of mistakes, but it would be necessary to set aside funds at once in order to begin without delay the acquisition of land and the raising of larger supplies of plants.2. Food Supplies.The Royal Commission on Coast Erosion and Afforestation^ estimated the production of food from the kinds of land which would be afforested at 15 lbs. of mutton per acre per annum, and the loss on withdrawing 9,000,000 acres at 60,000 tons per annum. That amount was estimated to be equal to 2&quot; 67 per cent., of the current consumption of meat and to 4&quot; 81 per cent, of the home supply.The information which we have had before us - as to the production of mutton on hill farms leads us to the conclusion that the estimate of the Commission was somewhat above the mark. Judging from the information we have received as to the actual stock on sheep farms and - allowing for the fact that the land to be planted may have a grazing value above the average, we believe that the loss of mutton cannot exceed 10 lbs. per acre planted even on the best ground.&quot;)&quot; In the case of deer forests the loss of venison will not exceed 2 lbs. per acre planted. It would appear conse-quently that the total displacement due to the withdrawal of 1,770,000 acres, as recommended by us, will not reduce the home supply by more than two-thirds of 1 per cent, nor the total supply by four-tenths of 1 per cent. It should be remembered that the withdrawal will be gradual and will not be complete for eighty years. We are consequently of opinion that the nation will be Avell advised to sacrifice this relatively trivial contribution to its meat supply in exchange for the certainty that it would be self-supporting in timber in such an emergency as the present.IX. THE PROMOTION OF SILVICULTURE..1. Forestry Surveys.Surveys are a necessary and preliminary step towards the institution of schemes of. afforestation, and we are strongly of opinion that no time should be lost in pressing on with them. The three Agricultural Departments have already made some progress with the inspection and classification of uncultivated land from the afforestation pCint of view (see p. 36), but the work requires co-ordinating and speeding up. We append a joint report^&quot;, which has been prepared at our request by Messrs. Borthwick, Forbes and Robinson, and we have also brought their report to the notice of the departments concerned,&apos;with a recommendation that the work be begun by a joint survey party this spring. We understand that steps have been taken to give effect to our recom-mendation. We trust that it may be&apos; found possible to- make considerable progress with surveys in order that concrete schemes of afforestation may be worked out ready for putting into operation as quickly as possible after the cessation of hostilities.The method outlined in the memorandum referred to above will involve the inspection of a considerable number of woods, but we think that the survey should ultimately be extended to include all woods in order that there may be established a definite datum line, from which progress may be estimated. We have already referred to the unsatisfactory nature of the statistics relating to our woodlands. Such1 excuses for this state of affairs as existed before the war have been swept away, and now that the importance of maintaining stocks of growing timber in the country has been fully* Cd. 4460, paras. 78 and 79.I The farms from which we have actually received returns show a production varying from 10 lbs. to 2 lbs. of mutton per acre per annum, the latter figure being.not uncommon in, the north, and west Highlands of Scotland. : I Appendix 5.
realised, and -the stocks themselves are undergoing severe depletion, it is doubly necessary that the question should be dealt with in a thorough way and at once.We&quot; are not by any means the first body to recommend a stock-taking of the woods of the country. The Commission appointed in 1787 to inquire into the state of the Crown Woods,while lamenting the absence of reliable data, recommended a similar step. This recommendation has been repeated from time to time, especially in recent years, but apart from the voluntary returns, which are admittedly very incomplete, no survey has been undertaken to this day.&apos;, , 2. Provision of Plants.Owing to shortage of labour and to other causes very little planting has been done during the war. Nursery-men have had to destroy many thousands of young trees which had become over-grown, and have been unable to sow seed to replace them. A serious shortage of plants is consequently to be apprehended at the end of the war. The Office of Woods and the Boards of Agriculture, by means of funds provided by the Development Commission, have sown considerable quantities of seeds against emergency planting operations ; it is estimated that these sowings have produced plants sufficient for the afforestation of about 5,000 acres.We recommend that sowings should be continued on the same scale and that the land required for lining out the seedlings, amounting to perhaps 200 acres, should be provided.3. Education, Experiment, and Research. Education.Forest Officers. For carrying out the scheme which we recommend, three classes of officials will be required, namely, forest officers, foresters and foremen. The first class will consist of inspectors engaged in surveys, &amp;c, the preparation of planting plans, supervision of planting and replanting.and advisory and experimental work. We estimate that the- service will require 60 officers by the fifth year of operations. Probably 20 reliable men with a good knowledge of British conditions would be available at the outset, and recruitment would need to proceed at the rate of about 15 men per annum for two years, and thereafter 5 per annum for three or four years. By that time the greater part of the preliminary survey work should be finished, and the recruitment might fall to two or three men per annum. The men selected for this purpose should have passed through a two-years&apos; special forestry course at one of the recognised Universities, and their practical training should have been given a distinctly British bias, including a course of instruction in British woods and of surveying rough afforestable land; It would be necessary to conclude the training with a visit to France and Switzerland, during which a study of continental methods and results would be carried on.. It is obvious that special measures will have to be taken to ensure that in the next few years men of the right type come forward for this training in sufficient numbers. Special courses of instruction should be arranged at the Universities and supplemented with practical work in the Demonstration Area, and at centres where scientific afforesta-tion has been carried on for a sufficient length of time. Since the future of the movement will depend on these men it is necessary that they should possess a high standard of ability. The standard necessary is that represented by a good Honours degree in Science. Even before the conclusion of the war it may be possible to find some men Avho are incapacitated from serving in H.M. Forces, but are in every other respect fit to Jake this training and subsequently to carry out the responsible administrative work to which it will lead. Efforts should at once be made to find them. When men of the right type are selected the studentships given them should coyer a two-years&apos; course leading up to a diploma. The studentships should be of the same amount, namely, 1501. a year, as is awarded to the probationers for the Indian Forest Service, and this sum should cover fees and maintenance.We have referred above to courses at a University and in a Demonstration Area. With regard to the first, there were in existence before the war several academic centres - at which a high standard of instruction in scientific forestry was given. Their number was more than sufficient to meet the requirements which then existed. There is a waste of public money in this multiplicity of teaching centres. This want .of proportion is due to the fact that while attention has been given to education, the* llth Report, 1793.G- 2
practical side of forestry has been almost entirely neglected. None of the centres is really adequately equipped or staffed although the grants in the aggregate are sufficient for maintaining one first class school of forestry. We recommend that the State should definitely select at most two of them as those whose diploma in forestry candidates for the highest posts in the State&apos;s service should normally be required to obtain. Having selected them, it should be incumbent upon the State to see that they are sufficiently equipped for the work they have to do. This selection of one or more Universities for a special purpose would not interfere with forestry being taught at all Universities, as we think it should be, as part of the agricultural course. As to Demonstration Areas, at present the only area adequate for the practical instruction of University students is the Forest of Dean, and this should be used for the practical instruction of all the students whom we are considering until other areas can be efficiently organised. There is, unfortunately, no Demonstration Area in Scotland, and no Crown forest which could be utilised for that purpose. We think that students from Scotland should for the present make use of the Forest of Dean and specially of the Tintern Woods, where the management of coniferous woods can be studied under conditions very similar to those prevailing in a great part of Scotland. As afforestation proceeds in Scotland, an accessible area should be selected to take eventually the place of the Forest of Dean, as far as Scottish students are concerned.Foresters and Foremen. The Forestry Service will require two further grades of employees : (1) Foresters who would be locally in charge of planting operations. (2) Foremen, of whom there should be about four under each forester.Under ordinary circumstances these two classes should be recruited in the same way. Young men should be taken into the forestry schools at the age of eighteen or nineteen and it is desirable that they should have had some experience of woods. But the schools should also be open to young Avorkmen who after leaving elementary schools have continued their education at continuation schools, or passed through secondary schools. They would all enter the forestry schools as workmen, and would all perform the ordinary operations of forestry as workmen receiving Avages. They would also all attend the school for at least a six months&apos; course, and the more intelligent and energetic should be alloAved to attend further courses for eighteen months. Foresters and foremen would be produced by a process of selection. Some after the tAvo years course would be fit for immediate appointment as foresters, others would obtain such appointments after a feAv years&apos; experience as foremen, others would become foremen and so remain, others might be allowed to remain as skilled woodmen in the forests where the schools are situated.In the first ten years the service will require about 150 foresters and 600 foremen, and though no doubt some of each class will be attracted to the State service from private employment, this will hardly be a desirable method of recruitment at a time Avhen every effort should be made to develop afforestation by private OA\mers. Special efforts should, therefore, be made to secure the entry of young men of the right type into the forestry schools. Money spent in making these courses thoroughly attractive to men of the best type will be fully repaid in later years, for our knowledge of other countries convinces us that nothing has a closer and more direct bearing on the financial returns from State forests than the degree of trained intelligence and resourcefulness possessed by their foresters. It will be necessary to arrange that from. 125 to 150 students shall enter upon ti-aining every year for the first ten Arears in order to provide for the increased needs both of the State and private owners. For the first feAv years a considerable number of selected applicants should be given bursaries.The schools available for the type of training which we recommend are at the Forest of Dean, Chopwell Woods (Newcastle), and AArondale in Ireland. All three are now closed, but should be re-opened as soon as circumstances permit. There is at present no similar school for forest apprentices in Scotland. We think that such a school should be established at once in connection with an area of woods available for demonstration and work. The only area, as far as we know, at present available is that belonging to the North of Scotland Agricultural College at Craibstone, near Aberdeen. This would be an excellent site for such a school, as it lies Avithin the principal woodland area in Scotland. As afforestation develops, more than one school of this character will be required in Scotland. The northerly position of this site is, therefore, no objection.We consider that the Forest Authority should undertake, in addition to the training of men required for its own services, the general control of Forestry Education
in the United Kingdom, and we recommend that special attention he paid to the provision of short courses at convenient centres where a number of woodmen in private service can attend. We believe that in this way a considerable influence for good may be exerted on the management of private woods.It has been pointed out to us by the Scottish Landowners&apos; Association, and we are in complete agreement with the recommendation, that more attention should be given in all these courses to the. instruction of foresters in ordinary business methods.Research and Experiment.In beginning operations the Forest Authority will find itself confronted with many silvicultural problems which will be solved only after careful investigation conducted over considerable periods of time, and we consider that judicious expenditure on laboratory research and experiment in the forest will be amply repaid in due course by increased yield. The need for experiment and research have, in the past, some-times been put forward as an excuse for delaying planting operations, but while we believe the early development of research schemes to be necessary, we are satisfied that there is no occasion whatever to delay planting operations on carefully selected land. The parts which experiment and research have to play in the scheme which we recommend are the improvement of existing woods, the determination of the best and cheapest methods of forming new woods and of tending and protecting them to the best advantage.We do not propose to enter into this question in detail, which is a matter for the Forest Authority when constituted, but we may say that we are in general agreement with the programme set out in the memorandum on &quot; Experiment and Research &quot; appended to the Report of the Advisory Committee on Forestry in England and Wales (Cd. 6713) and with the steps which the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries were taking before the war to give effect to that programme. We desire to emphasise the point that by research we do not mean only the acquisition and formulation of new knowledge. The methods that have hitherto generally prevailed in British forestry have resulted in a great amount of experience being gained both of what to do and how to do it, and of what not to do and how not to do it. The careful examination and recording of this by men of trained scientific ability will make available a great deal of material which is now not widely known or, where known, is not wisely applied.4. Advice on Forest Management.We recommend as a measure for increasing the production from privately owned woods the continuance of the advisory system which has been carried out by means of grants from the Development Fund. The Board of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland has in part made use of its regular forest officers for the purpose of advising owners on the treatment, protection and utilisation of wood-lands ; while the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries appointed in 1912 five Ad visor v Officers, each with a specific district under his charge, for the same purpose. A similar step was taken by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland in 1917, when three Advisory Officers were appointed for Scotland.We think that the existence of an expert&apos;- body of advisers must necessarily have an excellent effect in promoting a wider understanding of the advantages of scientific forest management, and that the work which the Advisory Officers will be called upon to do will be especially valuable in guiding into the most effective channels the efforts which we trust private owners will make after the war in reconstructing then-depleted woods.5. Forest Pests.Insects. Fellings in coniferous woods have already proceeded far enough to indicate that a serious increase of destructive insects is to be apprehended. This is particularly the case where fallen timber is allowed to lie in the woods over the breeding season and where no attempt is made to destroy the debris. Shortage of labour has often rendered all except the most urgent work impossible, and the felling areas consequently present the most favourable conditions for the breeding of insects. The commonest insect pests in coniferous plantations are the pine weevil, Hylobius abietis, and the pine beetle, Hylurgus piniperda, though it is possible that other bark insects which normally do little damage in Great Britain may find conditions favourable for development. The pine weevil breeds especially in the stumps of pine and spruce and destroys young plants, while the beetle breeds in fallen or weakly trees andCr   3
destroys the smaller shoots of pine trees of all sizes. The weevil was familiar in British woods&quot;before the war, and did so much damage to young plantations on the site of old pine woods that it was usual to postpone re-planting for,several, years, at the end of which time the pine stumps were not so suitable to the weevil for breeding purposes. The pine beetle also did a considerable amount of damage, though the effects were not so noticeable. Instances are known on the Continent, however, where extensive areas of pine woods have been killed by it.We have drawn particular attention to these two insects for two reasons : Q) Because the pine weevil will render the re-planting of many areas a .   proceeding which should be undertaken with caution, and in many cases ! &apos; . postponed for some years.   The loss of time may be regrettable, but long experience has proved that it is often better in the long run to wait rather than to rush into re-planting. (2) Because the pine beetle may cause very serious damage to such woods as remain after the war; woods which, in the national interest, should be carefully protected.The whole question is ,one to which the Forest Authority should give early attention. It is not necessary here to enter further into details, but it may well be desirable for the Authority to issue and to enforce orders calling on owners of woodlands to take definite steps for dealing effectively with such pests.Rabbits. Rabbits, voles and squirrels are enemies of plantations, and of these the rabbit is the worst and the most difficult to deal. with. The existence of rabbits in large numbers in a great many districts suitable for planting is indeed a serious menace to economic forestry. Squirrels also are in some places a serious clanger, but they, are much easier to keep under than are rabbits.The expense of erecting rabbit-proof wire-netting to protect young trees may be estimated from a few examples. Assuming that the areas are square, a square being the cheapest rectangular area from this point of view, an acre block normally costs more to fence than to plant, a block of 20 acres may cost about lL15s. per acre, and on a 100-acre block, which is a much larger piece of ground than would generally be planted up atonce, the cost ofiwiring would amount to 15s. an acre. In addition to the cost of protecting artificial plantations, the damage which rabbits do in preventing the natural regenera-tion of woods is very great. We are agreed that it would be little short of disastrous if costs of this nature were to fall upon the Forest Authority in a large proportion of its undertakings. But .it is not,so,easy to suggest the right action to take. The rabbit question is primarily agricultural, and we think it very necessary that the State-should take it up from this point of view and pass legislation upon it. The general basis for action,is clear, namely, that it should be the duty of all who occupy land har-bouring rabbits to prevent them entering their neighbours&apos; land. If legislation on these lines were passed and strictly enforced, it would mean in practice that, except from enclosed warrens in which they would be kept on account of the definite contribution they can (under proper conditions) make to the food supply, rabbits would be exter-minated or kept down very closely indeed. Under these circumstances, if a person or public authority could show that he or they were forced to fence land in order to exclude rabbits, after due notice had been given to the persons responsible, it ought to be made possible to recover from them the whole or a great part of the cost. In our opinion, the duty of seeing that the law was properly carried out should fall upon the Local Authority, as it does in the case of insanitary buildings and nuisances; and if the persons responsible did not properly observe it the authority should be under the responsibility of carrying out the law on their behalf, recovering the.cost. If it were not possible to prove upon whom responsibility lay as regards any particular area, the cost of dealing with it should be borne on the local rates. The important thing from the point of view of the /Forest Authority is that it should not have to bear large expenses for extermination and for fencing. If a statutory duty was imposed! such as we contemplate, owners from whom land might be acquired would be expected! to see that their land was clear of rabbits before the authority took it over, and if: compulsory proceedings for acquisition had to be taken it would not be justifiable for the owner to have the cost of .so doing charged against the authority when the purchase price was fixed.It is often stated that rabbits cannot be exterminated, and this, is urged im particular by trajDpers to whose interest it is not to continue trapping operations when they become unprofitable and to leave a sufficient stock of rabbits to make it probable that trapping will again be necessary.  We have sufficient evidence to show, however,
that by systematic measures rabbits can be kept down so completely that even if they cannot be exterminated the actual damage which they do is practically negligible, and we believe that if the only alternative to extermination of rabbits which is allowed to owners and occupiers is to prevent them from getting on to neighbouring land by wiring, and this alternative is rigorously enforced, effective means of extermination will generally be discovered and applied.The great harm hitherto done to woodland by rabbits has often been caused by the separation which has existed between the duties of gamekeeper and forester in woods. It appears to us that in all State and State-aided woods the forester should be made responsible for the destruction of rabbits within the woods.X. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FOREST INDUSTRY.1. The Incidence of Public Burdens on Woodlands.It. has been strongly represented to us that woodlands are subjected to much-heavier public burdens than other forms of property and that in equity, if not for the purpose of encouraging forestry, their incidence should be revised. We have accordingly investigated the matter carefully ; examples of the actual payments made in respect of woods have been supplied to us through the Arboricultural Societies and direct by a number of estates, and the Local Government and Inland Revenue Boards have furnished us with information bearing on the present state of the law with regard to rates, income tax, succession and estate duties and excess profits tax.&apos;:;:&quot;Woodlands may be subject to one or all of the following burdens : -(a) Local rates.(b) Income tax (including super tax).(c) Death and succession duties.(d) Excess profits tax.(e) Land tax, tithe rent and similar charges.(/) Special payments in respect of extraordinary traffic.(a) Local Rates. Before the Rating Act of 1874 land used as a plantation or wood was exempt from rating, saleable underwood alone being rateable. That Act classified woodland under the following heads : -(1) Land used only as a plantation or a wood.(2) Land used for the growth of saleable underwood.(3) Land used both for a plantation or a wood, and also for the growth of saleable underwood.In the first case the Act provided that the gross and rateable value should be estimated as if the land, instead of being a plantation or a wood, were let and occupied in its natural and unimproved state. In the second case the Statute required that the value shall be estimated as if the land were let for the growth of saleable underwood. In the third case the land was to be rated either as in the first case or as in the second case.In 1910 the Local Government Board, on the representation of a committee appointed at the British Timber Trade Conference of 1909, issued a circular to Union Assessment Committees calling attention to the provisions of the Act of 1874. It appears that, in consequence, assessments have been reduced in a large number of cases, but the instances brought to our notice show that some assessments are still as high as 8s. lid. per acre exclusive of sporting value.In Ireland woods are assessed under Griffiths&apos; valuation of 1852-1864 which was based on the estimated agricultural value of the land at that time. The result is that woods on certain types of land, for example on demesnes, are assessed at a higher value than similar woods in Great Britain. Considerable discrepancy occurs between assessments in the North and the South of Ireland due to the fact that Griffiths&apos; valuation was begun in the South in the famine years and was completed in the North some time afterwards. In Ireland the unit of assessment is the tenement which may include both woods and agricultural land.The total of rates per   also varies very considerably in Great Britain. In the examples before us the range is from 8s. Id. to 3s. Sd. in the  , while the actual payments vary from Id. to 2s. 3d per acre.(b) Income Tax. Assessment to income tax generally follows closely assessment to rates. The OAvner of woodlands is liable to payment under Schedule A, and also under Schedule B, or he may now, instead of paying under Schedule B, elect to have.* See Appendix 6a.G 4
Woods which are to be managed on commercial lines taxed tinder Schedule 2), hi which case payment is made on profits only. The application of Schedule D to woodlands was explained in some detail by Mr. McKenna&apos;:::&quot; in the House of Commons on July 17th, 1916, and is explained further in the Memorandum supplied to us by the Board of Inland Revenue (Appendix 6a). These provisions if carried out in the spirit of these explanations and without undue delay ought, it appears to us, to remove any cause of complaint on the ground of hardship due to the double payment under both Schedule A and Schedule B. They are worthy of careful study, for we have evidence that there is at present considerable misapprehension on the subject.Owners of woods are also liable for super tax, but though this tax may unfortunately in some cases render profitable forestry impossible, we are unable to regard this form of taxation as other than a tax on the individual and not on a par-ticular form of property.Payments under Schedule A have increased greatly owing to increased taxation during the War, and most owners now pay at the rate of 5s. in the pound. The highest payment per acre brought to our notice was 2s. 3d. including sporting (assessment, 10s. Qd. per acre), and the lowest Id. per acre (assessment, 4cZ.), the rate being 5s. in the   in each instance.The table below shows for certain selected estates, including those making the highest and the lowest payments per acre, the incidence of rates, and income tax Schedule A. We have omitted payments under Schedule B, because, as we have stated above, payment can be avoided on that head by transferring the woods to Schedule D, in which case payment is made only on profits : Statement showing the Incidence of Rates and Taxes (Schedule A), on certain Woods.Wood.

It wilP be observed that the total payments per acre for rates and taxes under Schedule A, range for British woods from 2d. per acre to 4s. (Estate L); the pay-ment of 4s. Qd: per acre on Estate 0 includes shooting. In many cases of high assessment the remedy appears to lie with the owners, and although we are aware that owners may have other reasons for not wishing to raise the question of their present assessment, we think that where no appeal has been lodged the rating system cannot fairly be blamed. We think that if assessments were reduced, as they should be, to a&apos; maximum of about 3s. Qd. per acre there would be no further cause for com-plaint. The actual payment per acre, exclusive of payments on account of Schedule D, would then very rarely exceed 2s. per acre per annum, which we think would be reasonable in view of the present high level of taxation.In the case of Ireland we are of opinion that steps should be taken to place the assessment of woodlands on the same plane as in Britain, that is.on the natural and unimproved value &quot;of the land and not on its presumed value for agricultural purposes, and further that they should be assessed separately and not as at present included with agricultural land to form a tenement.(c) Death and Succession Duties. The present position as will be seen from the Board of Inland Revenue&apos;s Memorandum varies very greatly according to the time of death. Recent legislation, however, has improved matters very considerably. The value of growing timber is no longer taken into account in estimating the total value of the estate ; payment is made only as timber is felled and realised, and then only on the net value after deducting necessary outgoings.We are not concerned with the principle on which death duties are levied, nor as to whether the successor in title should pay more or less in respect.of a certain form of property, but we should welcome any form of legislation which rendered it obligatory for the new owner to maintain woods in a state of production at least equal to that in which they were handed over to him.(d) Excess Profits Tax. We understand that it is not the intention to levy this tax in respect of the large quantities of timber which have been felled during the war, and we are of opinion that such exemption is reasonable. The returns which have been secured by war fellings, at the prices which have ruled up to the date of writing, are in no sense excess profits, but merely the realisation of capital and accumulated interest which have been locked up for long periods of time.(e) Land Tax and Tithe Bent and similar Charges. Payments on account of land tax where still unredeemed are relatively small and do not call for special comment. Tithe rent and similar charges are payable in respect of a portion of our woodlands only. Frequently the charge has been redeemed, and in other cases the existence of the charge has been taken account of in changes of ownership. Further, tithe rent charges are private property, and for that reason alone the State can hardly be expected to intervene.(/) Special Payments in respect of Extraordinary Traffic have always been resented by the owners of woodlands, and it appears to us with justice. &quot;Owners have to pay rates over the whole lifetime of a wood, and except for the year in which the crop is felled make little or no use of the roads to the upkeep of which they have contributed. . .We recommend, therefore, that provided the haulage is conducted in a reasonable manner^ and that due notice is given to the road authority, it should not in future be permissible to require special payments towards the repair of roads in respect of the carriage of timber.2. Railway Rates.The high cost of transporting home-grown timber by rail has been the source of many complaints by timber-growers, and numerous attempts were made before the war, but without appreciable success, to secure more favourable terms from the railway companies.   The producer argued &quot;that timber, often an excellent freight,U   4650       &apos;-&quot; it
especially in the form of pitwood, -was deserving of a lower classification^ ; that it was not profitable to grow timber for any but local markets ; that imported timber received more favourable consideration from the railway companies, and generally that railway 3 rates -should be reduced to a level which would permit home-grown timber to compete in the open market with imported material. To these arguments the railway com-panies answered, as far as they replied at all, that home-grown timber was placed on rail in small lots intermittently, and in such a form that it takes up much space in proportion to its weight, rendering close supervision in loading and special wagons necessary; that, in any case, maximum rates which have not been exceeded had been fixed by Parliament; and, further, that the railway companies were not called upon to prove that their rates corresponded to costs of transit, as Parliament did not allow them to increase any of the existing maximum rates however far below costs of transit-they might be.We believe that the timber industry has been unduly hampered by railway rates, but we are not in a position to pjrove this in any particular case, for the simple reason that we do not know the working costs in dealing with native timber and we are unable, consequently, to state whether the margin of profit was excessive or whether a system of cheaper rates would have proved more remunerative to the companies themselves in - the long run by encouraging an increase in traffic. And though undoubtedly rates on imported timber are often more favourable than for home-grown timber, which has a less distance to travel, it is not possible to decide whether this preference is unfair, owing to the very different conditions under which the home and foreign timber supply is handled. We are certain, however, from the facts which have been brought to our notice, that normally a large quantity of valuable home-grown timber fails to reach its most useful market owing to the railway charges which have to be met. Without going into great detail we may, perhaps, illustrate the point by two examples. Attempts were made before the war to open a regular trade in pit-props between the South Wales collieries and the pine woods in the neighbourhood of Bagshot. Pitwood imported from France was then selling at about 25s. per ton at the mines, and the railway rate quoted was 15s. per ton. This left a margin of 10s. per ton to cover the value of the timber, the cost of felling, preparation, haulage to rail, and supervision. The margin was absorbed as to 7s. per ton by the last four items, leaving 3s. per ton to represent the value of the standing timber; which had taken from 30 to 50 years to grow. Under these circumstances, the attempt was abandoned. In the second example a proposal was under considera-tion for opening up a trade in the utilisation of birch wood in Scotland.&apos; The mateiial was worth 27s. per ton delivered, and the railway haulage by two routes was respectively 228 and 157 miles. The only quotation which was obtained from the railway companies concerned was 19s. -Id. per ton, station to station, exclusive of loading and unloading, a quotation equivalent to a penny per ton per mile if based on* It may be stated briefly that merchandise traffic is arranged in Classes A, B and C, and Classes 1,2, 3.4. and 5. In a general way Classes A, B and C refer to materials in bulk and Classes 1 to 5 to consignments in special packages. Class A contains raw materials such as limestone, coke and sand ; Class B, partially manufactured and bulky materials, such as bricks; Class C, bulky material in a further stage of manu-facture, such as acetate of lime. &quot; Timber &quot; is placed in Class C when carried by actual machine weight and in Class 1 when by measurement weight. Exceptional rates are charged on certain timbers, e.g., deals, battens and boards and pit-props not consigned direct to a mine ; while pit-props consigned direct to a mine are charged at 10 per cent, less than exceptional rates or, in the absence of exceptional rates, at 10 per cent, less than Class C rates. When timber is consigned by measurement weight 40 cubic feet of oak or other ]*eavy timber, 50 cubic feet of fir or other light timber, or 66 cubic feet of deal, battens and boards may be &quot;-Uarged for as one ton.Examples of the maximum rates for the conveyance of Classes A, B, C and 1 are shown in the table below.   The maxima differ to some extent with different companies.f-i.--   .

the longer route.. In this case there was no possibility of covering expenses, and the proposal was also abandoned. tUnder the exceptional circumstances due to the war railway charges on pitwood have been modified considerably, the higher rates being reduced appreciably, but rates: under 10s. being retained.   That for pitwood from Bagshot to South Wales is now about 12s. per ton.   In Scotland a maximum charge of 10s. is in force.   We have made inquiries as to whether the consequent increase in volume has rendered the traffic profitable, but the information is apparently not yet available.   It should certainly be a matter for enquiry after the war by the Government as soon as con-venient, whether the 10s. rate will prove remunerative.   The ready sale of thinnings as pitwood is of great importance when considering the financial side of afforestation and of even more importance than formerly, owing to the high bank rate.   Numerous similar instances of prohibitive rates could be quoted, but we are not concerned so much with making out a case on the basis of past experience as in attempting to formulate some arrangement by which forestry may be encouraged in the future.   It is essential, if forestry is to become popular with private individuals (who own 97 per cent, of our existing woods), that timber should be readily marketable, whether as mature logs or pit-props or in any other form which permits of systematic classification. The development of remunerative markets for home-grown timber appears to us. to be largely a question of organisation and co-operation between the grower, on the one hand, and the consumer on the other, and we are of opinion that where the two are prepared to co-operate with the object of building up a steady home industry the existence of prohibitive railway rates should not be allowed to remain an insuperable obstacle. &apos; We recommend, therefore, that the Forest Authority should be given power, in cases where it is satisfied that a primd facie case for a revision of rates has been made out, to demand a conference with the railway companies concerned in order that the difficulties on both sides may be discused and, if possible, a settlement arrived at.   In the event of the conference failing to agree, we see no alternative but for the case to go forward to a tribunal which should have power to settle the matter summarily.The two principles which, in our opinion, the Authority should be able to establish as a basis for action are, firstly, that rates should be granted between the main producing and consuming centres which would enable timber to be grown remuneratively for the supply of its natural market, and, secondly, that a re-classification of rates should be worked out in cases in which it can be proved that the existing classification is unfair compared to freight of a similar character. The object of the reclassification should be to encourage timber being placed on rail in bulk and with uniformity and regularity.3, Organisation of Timber Industry.In describing the difficulty of improvising an organisation in time of war to provide increased home supplies of timber, emphasis has been-laid on the unorganised state of the home timber market. This is a position into which both growers and merchants had drifted during the period when unlimited cheap supplies of first class foreign timber were available. It is an eminently unsatisfactory position and the rise in price of imported timber during the last 15 years has deprived it of any justification. If the future of forestry is to be stable and assured the timber industry must be properly organised. Should growers and dealers show a real disposition to take the organisa-tion of supplies seriously, the State should assist and encourage them in every possible way. Without a real will and an ability to organise among those responsible for growing and marketing, a proper organisation is hopeless, however much: the State may encourage it. This means that there must be close, systematic and constant-co-operation between those concerned. Of recent years a good deal has been done.in this direction by the efforts of societies, both in England and Scotland, which have worked hard under able and energetic direction, but much still remains to be done.Obviously two steps are necessary for the better utilisation of home timber: the-first is to place regularly each grade of timber on the market to which it is best suited, and the second is to seek out new and more lucrative markets for which the home timber is as well suited as the imported. Organisation should, from one point of view, be much easier after the war than it was before. The war has demonstrated to timber users the excellent quality of many kinds of British timber. If proper advantage is taken of the openings which have been made in this way) much permanent benefit both to producers and consumers may result. What is needed from the producers is that they should ensure regularity, continuity and^ uniformity^ ofII 2 &apos;
supplies, and this in the present state of our woods and forests can only be attained by the closest co-operation between them in organising their fellings. In supplying modern markets, a careful classification of timber is also most important, and much may be done in this direction by joint action. In the existing state of our woodlands, much of the timber will be of inferior quality, which renders classification the more necessary. The Secretary of the English Forestry Association and the Landowners&apos; Oo-operative Forestry Society, Limited, both draw special attention to this point in their memoranda. As woods come under more systematic management supplies will become less intermittent, and organisation should become easier.It seems to us possible that the best means of assisting this side of the work would be by giving Government assistance to a Forestry Organisation Society, which might be formed on much the same lines as the existing Agricultural Organisation Society. The owner of a small estate is in very much the same position with regard to timber as is the small holder with regard to the produce of his holding; and we believe that the, timber owner might be much helped, as. the smallholder has been, by the skilled organisation of co-operative societies on right lines, which would receive guidance and assistance from a central expert body.A good deal might be done by public departments such as the Post Office and Office of Works in making greater use of home timbers.We think that the Forest Authority should include in its organisation an Intelligence Branch, which would be concerned chiefly with questions relating to the organisation of the home timber trade, in devising methods of improving the utilisation of forest products, and generally in issuing information which would be helpful to owners of woodland and to users of wood and timber. To do this work effectively, the Branch would have to take stock periodically of the world&apos;s timber markets in relation to the supply of the United Kingdom, and one might expect to find that in the course of such reviews many additional or neglected uses will be found for home-grown timbers. As, if our scheme be adopted, the State will itself be a large grower of timber, it will be bound in its. own interest to organise the best markets for the timber which the State forests will produce, and money expended for the purpose may be expected to bring in a direct return. A proper scheme of organisation of markets must develop gradually as fully stocked woods are created and come into full yield, but the question of markets will be worthy of systematic and steady attention from the time when the Forest Authority is set up. This Intelligence Branch, if it kept in touch with local co-operative effort, might do much towards attaining the objects referred to in our last two paragraphs.4. Woodland Industries.While the main question which we have had before us is the provision of supplies of timber, and especially coniferous timber, we have also given some consideration to that of the better utilisation of the small wood growing in large areas of coppice-woods, and the waste of large trees which is produced in sawmill operations. There is no reason why almost the whole of these classes of wood should not be put to some useful purposes instead of being allowed to rotas is so frequently the case. It is clear that the close utilisation of the products of the soil is in every way an economic advantage, and if in the process the producer of timber can reap a part of the profit, the incentive to maintain woods in good order will be increased.We do not propose to enter exhaustively into all the uses which can be made of small and waste wood, but merely to indicate some of those to which attention has : been drawn during the war.   Probably the most important is the wood distillation industry which, as already mentioned on page 17, produces acetate of lime and acetone, charcoal, methyl alcohol and other by-products.   Acetone was essential for the manufacture of cordite, and charcoal for metallurgical processes, while the other products find very useful application in the manufacturing arts connected with military enterprise, in dyeing and in medicine.   The industry was existent in Great Britain : at the beginning of the war, and was consuming perhaps 20,000 tons of wood per -annum, chiefly in small old-fashioned plants.   Extensions and new factories have since raised the consumption to about 75,000 tons per annum, and there are a number ;of other, suitable sites where factories might have been installed had the necessary labour been available for manufacturing and erecting the plant.   The industry had -failed to develop in Great Britain, not because the raw material was not available nor too expensive, but. because of unscientific methods and lack of encouragement from the Government, which preferred to rely on Germany, Austria and the United States i for supplies: of acetone,   ; . .    .
202XL-THE FOREST AUTHORITY AND ITS FUNCTIONS.The Committee have given particular attention to the questions of the constitution of the Forest Authority, the method of providing it with funds, and its responsibility to Parliament.    All rural development is so intimately connected that it might seem* Further examples of the uses to which coppice material may he put are : clogs, chestnut fencing, piano keys, crate-making, ship-fenders, pencils.H 3There is in fact no reason why any woody material should be allowed to go to, waste in a highly industrial country like this, provided that the markets are: energetically organised and developed. We can perhaps best illustrate this contention by a brief description of the utilisation of the produce of some 2,000 acres of coppice in the Crown woods at Tintern. The coppice is of oak and beech and some ash, with a considerable proportion of inferior species such as birch, and scattered among the coppice are large-crowned oak standards. The best and straightest of the oak and beech poles are sold as pitwood and the short straight lengths of the crooked branches are cut up into &quot; cog-wood &quot; and sold with the pitwood to the South Wales mines. The birch and some of the oak and beech are turned up in simple lathes into chair legs, tool handles and similar small wood-ware. Ash poles are cleft into tool and pick handles, small hazel, ash, and oak into barrel-hoops. The turnings and shavings are burned and the ashes have found a ready sale since the war as a source of potash. After selecting all the wood which can be used for the above and similar purposes there remains only crooked wood, which is corded and sold to the Forest of Dean Wood Distillation Factory, or small sticks of an inch or so in diameter. From the last pea-sticks and bean rods are prepared to the extent of the local demand, and the woody material remaining to be burned in order to clear the ground for planting operations consists of small twigs only. During the war other small industries such as tent-peg and spoke making have also been set on foot. These results have been attained with very simple machinery provided by private enterprise, but with the encouragement of the Crown. With the expenditure of a small amount of capital on better machinery various other products, such as wood wool, for example, might be turned out. Industries similar in character to those mentioned above have been developed in other parts of the country. Home-grown beech and birch are quite extensively used in Scotland and in Lancashire for the manufacture of bobbins, thus reducing to some extent the import of birch bobbin squares. from Northern Europe, while in the South of England hurdles are also made from underwood.*In our opinion there is no adequate reason why industries of the type which we have indicated, should not be developed to meet at least the home consumption. The outlay on plant and machinery is low, the raw material is abundant and cheap, and the labour is light and not of a highly skilled character. In fact turnery work and toy making is an occupation admirably suited to disabled soldiers and their families. It is also true that local industries, if successful, soon begin to draw their raw materials from wider areas, and as in the case of the High Wycombe chair industry, which began on the beech of the Chiltern Hills, ultimately compete with foreign countries by drawing their raw materials from abroad.We have nowr to consider what active means the State can take to promote the development of such industries. We have already suggested that the Forest Autho-rity should maintain, in connection with the organisation of the Timber Industry (p. 60), an Intelligence Branch which would be concerned mainly with the collection, correlation and distribution of information relating to the utilisation of timber in general and home timber in particular, and we think that the care of woodland industries should be committed to the same branch. At the same time it is desirable that the Authority should be in a position to give more practical help and to assist woodland owners who desire to establish local industries, by advancing capital on partnership or similar terms, or even to erect and&quot;rnaintain small demonstration plants. We would suggest that the Authority should move in cases of this kind only when it has been ascertained, after careful enquiry, that an industry could be established on remunerative conditions, but that private enterprise was unwilling to undertake the venture; and further that the undertaking having been demonstrated a success, the Authority should dispose of this interest, if a suitable opportunity arise, leaving development on a large scale to private enterprise. We believe that it is necessary for the State to give a definite lead in such matters, but having done so with success not to enter into further competition with private traders.
that the same authority should be responsible for both forestry and agriculture, and that both should be financed and administered in the same manner. But there are three separate Agricultural Authorities in the United Kingdom the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for England and Wales, the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland   each independently responsible through a different Minister to Parliament. Forestry has been under these different Departments in the- past, and its neglect may be partly due to the fact that the primary duty and chief interest of the Departments lay in other directions. Any tendency of this kind may well be inten-sified in the future when there may be large new developments of agricultural policy which will absorb all the efforts which the Departments can exert. But it is not wholly or mainly this factor in the situation which has determined our opinion; we believe that the most essential condition, if there is to be success in develop-ing large schemes of afforestation, is single responsibility and centralisation of inspira-tion, direction and control. This condition of success makes it impossible, in our opinion, to divide the duty of afforesting the required area between three different authorities. There must be a central authority steadily working out a consistent and uniform policy, not representing any one part of the United Kingdom more than another, but having the duty of seeing that a great national task is initiated and developed in whatever parts of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland the conditions are found to be most suitable. Different methods will succeed best in different parts of the country, and the central authority will have to accommodate its methods closely to the widely varying systems of land tenure which prevail in the different parts of the United Kingdom. But however much methods may vary, however well they may succeed in taking account of national sentiment or local custom, it is only by unity of control and direction that the State will be able to establish in some particular persons a direct responsibility for carrying out the task to be accomplished. It is not possible to preserve this responsibility if it be divided. Even if the present state of our knowledge of afforestable areas permitted it, which it does not, no data could be collected now which would enable the Government to apportion the task fairly between different authorities, still less to apportion the available funds. The share that each part of the United Kingdom will take can only be ascertained as the work develops, for apart from the distribution of areas in relation to the question of defence, it must depend largely upon the willingness of landowners to co-operate, and this only experience will show. And the available funds must always be expended with a single eye to securing the greatest possible return of timber, and without any idea that any particular part of the kingdom is entitled to have any particular sum expended on it. We are aware that it may appear a more costly form of administration to set up a new central authority than to make afforestation a branch of existing departments of agriculture, &quot;but we are strongly of opinion that this cost will be saved many times over in the long run by the system suggested in comparison with any system under which funds were separately allocated to the different parts of the United Kingdom. A separation of authorities must inevitably mean that each will endeavour to obtain as much money as possible to spend in its own area, whatever schemes be made on paper to secure a fair allocation, and this must inevitably lead to a large proportion of the money being less well spent than if all of it were under single control.A considerable element of independence is almost as important in the Forest Authority as unity of direction and control. Though the afforestation of many districts must proceed hand in hand with their development for agriculture, afforestation cannot wait upon agricultural development. Agricultural policy and practice may vary, if not from year to year, yet from decade to decade, to the benefit of the industry ; afforestation policy must be uniform for generations. Nor can the progress of afforestation be made, as has been assumed in some quarters, to depend upon the state of employment, except for a limited period of time. We have shown in another part of our Report the extent to which it is legitimate to depart from the system of equal annual plantings spread over the whole area of each working section. To this very moderate extent, and in the construction of forest roads, afforestation may help in providing employment in periods of depression, but a general system which made progress in afforestation dependent upon the general condition of the nation with regard to employment would be fatal to a &quot;proper afforestation policy. Further, the&apos;afforestation policy of the State, once embarked upon, should be as little as possible liable to be disturbed by political changes or moulded by political pressure. We cannot, and do not, claim &quot;that it should be independent of Parliamentary control, but when Parliament has once adopted a policy of afforestation the decisions that have to be taken as that policy develops should not be taken by politicians, and if grievances and difficulties arise they should be adjusted
in an atmosphere in which forest policy and not. political expediency is the deciding factor. The last respect in which independence, is important is with regard to funds. An element of controlis, of coarse, essential, and it may well be strictly enforced. Parliament must be informed of the cost and result of each year&apos;s work. The public, in fact, will want to know, and will have a right to know, that they are likely to get value for their money. This, however, ought not to be incompatible with an arrange-ment under which the Authority will have, during its early years at any rate, a greater degree of certainty as to the funds which it will administer than is generally produced under the system of submitting annual votes to Parliament. If there were a power to pull up the Authority by the roots to see how it was getting on, the results might be almost as serious as if a similar process were performed upon the trees that it had planted. The Authority, like the trees, must have a chance of striking deep root, and must therefore be able to plan its work for some years ahead with the certainty that it will have funds to carry it out.But if a single central authority be set up possessing the independence which we have described above, it will be none the less most desirable that, in the actual execution of the work which it directs, the closest co-operation should be maintained with the departments of agriculture of the different parts of the kingdom, and that full advantage should be taken of such organised public opinion in favour of forest development as may be found to exist. This means that the executive work should as far as possible be decentralised, and that an organisation should be set up in each part of the United Kingdom which will bring to bear the knowledge and experience there possessed for the guidance and assistance of the controlling authority.We submit the following as a concrete scheme which will combine the principles which we have just mentioned : 1. Forestry Commission.   There should be set up a Forestry Commission consisting of a limited number of persons, of whom at least one-half should be salaried whole-time officers, who should be given complete responsibility for carrying out the task which the Government may assign to them, and a complete control over all the operations which may &apos;be necessary to bring it into execution. In the early years of the work, at any rate, the task to be accomplished will require the full time of at least three paid Commissioners. Not only will it be necessary to secure and&apos; afforest a steadily increasing area of land, but schemes of training, experiment and research, and the systematic collection and co-ordination of data will also have to be set on foot and carefully supervised, and schemes devised for the settlement of the new population and equipment of their holdings. This is a big work which will for a considerable number of years need the whole energies and the whole time of the best men who can be found.There should be associated with them as unpaid Commissioners one or more persons who, though they may not , desire to become whole-time civil servants, may nevertheless be willing to give to the scheme during the critical early years the value of their influence and experience. This element may be of the greatest value, but in order to secure that the Commission as a whole shall show a steady unity of purpose, and that the responsibility for its operations may be definitely fixed, the number of unpaid Commissioners should not be greater than that of their paid whole-time colleagues. The Commission should be represented by a Commissioner in the House of Commons appointed by the Government of the day in the same way as the Parlia-mentary Ecclesiastical and Charity Commissioners, lie would, as they do, answer any questions as to the policy or proceedings of the Commission. But as the Forestry Commission would be directly responsible for the expenditure of sums placed at their disposal by Parliament, as the Charity and Ecclesiastical Commissions are not, there should be an annual opportunity for the Parliamentary Commissioner to give an account in Parliament of the work of the Commission to which he belonged, and to present a forecast of their expenditure for the coming year. We are aware that there may be objection to adding another salaried member to the Government, and we recommend that the Parliamentary Commissioner should not be in receipt of a ministerial salary. Under these circumstances, the amount of time which he gave to the work of the Commission would be optional, and would no doubt vary with the person selected; but we think that, considering the great interest of the subject, there would be no difficulty in finding a good man to fill the post. We recommend, therefore, that there should be set up a Commission of six members, three of whom should for the first years of the scheme be whole-time salaried officials and the others unpaid, including the Parliamentary Commissioner. One of the Commissioners should be nominated on appointment as Chairman, and at least one of those in receipt ofH 4
salary should be a technically trained Forest Officer. Salaries depend, largely on the question of pension and on expectation of tenure of office, and this depends on age of appointment and retirement. On those questions we can make no definite recommendations, but we think that the position, prospects and salaries of the Com-missioners should be generally similar to those of Assistant Secretaries in public departments. In suggesting three paid Commissioners we are not contemplating their allocation to different parts of the United Kingdom, but we are of opinion that the work to be done will fall into several main branches, and that each of these should be allotted to one of the Commissioners.2. Assistant Commissioners. The chief executive officers of the Commission should be Assistant Commissioners, one of whom should be appointed for each of the parts of the United Kingdom which are independent units for agricultural administration. The chief duty of the Assistant Commissioners would be to execute the policy which was being initiated, directed and controlled by the Commission, and for this purpose they should be provided with the necessary outdoor and indoor staff.3. Consultative Committees.   There should be Consultative Committees for England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland to assist the Commissioners in their work. These committees should contain representatives of the interests affected by the work of the Commission, such as Societies connected with forestry, County Councils, and holders and owners of land. The Boards of Agriculture should also be represented upon them, and special means should be taken to keep them in close touch with agricultural development and policy. We think that a Welsh Consultative Committee upon which the Welsh Agricultural Council should be well represented would be useful in bringing Welsh national sentiment to bear upon the work of the Commission in Wales.4. Forestry Fund. The next question with which we are here concerned is that of funds. We believe that when the Commission is set up, its policy for several years should be carefully considered and determined, and funds should be earmarked for afforestation purposes sufficient to secure the execution of this policy for a definite period. An account of the expenditure of the past year and a forecast of that of the next year should annually be placed before Parliament, and the work of the Commission would, of course, also be subject to audit in exactly the same way as that of other Government Departments. But if Parliament were satisfied that the approved policy were being carried out, the Commission should have freedom to draw upon the fund allotted to it in any way that seems to it best. We recommend that a fund be allotted, in the first place, sufficient to cover the first ten years of work. If this were done the question of granting a further fund for a further period or of proceeding after the first period by annual estimate could be left open. The important point is that during the early years there should be a certainty of steady and systematic development, and that when the question arose of renewing its resources, the Commission should be able to show not only that schemes had been initiated, but that real progress had been made, and that its methods had become systematised and established.5. Powers and Duties of the Commission. It may be desirable, finally, that the powers and duties of the Commission should be defined a little more closely. Powers must obviously be taken to purchase and to lease land for afforestation and purposes connected therewith, to manage and develop any land so acquired, to dispose either by sale or lease of land not suitable or not required for the purposes of the Commission, and generally to do all things incidental to the business of forestry.The Commission should be the body empowered to make orders under the Destructive Insects and Pests Acts, 1877 and 1907, in relation to forest insects and pests, and there should also be transferred or provision made for transferring to it the powers of the Board of Agriculture and other Departments with regard to forestry statistics, education and research. In connection with the exercise of these powers, officers of the Commission would require wide powers of entry on land and inspection of timber.In order that the Commission may be provided as far as possible from the beginning with experience in the management of growing woods and with facilities for training competent foresters, the Commission should be in the position to under-take on behalf of the body concerned the charge and management for forestal purposes of the Crown forests and woods now under the Office of Woods and Forests, the woods and property acquired for afforestation purposes by the Department of
Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, and any other properties which belong to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners or to a Public Department, and are-mainly or wholly forestal in character.The duties of the Commission would consist, in the first place, in carrying out the schemes of afforestation which we have already outlined, and, in the second place, in encouraging and improving the management of existing woods. To these main duties must be added the collection and preparation of statistics relating to forestry, the utilisation of timber, and to forest industries in general. Finally, it should be part of the charge of the Commission not only to grow timber and to encourage its growth in the United Kingdom, but also to. watch and report on the general forestry position, so that the security of the nation, both as regards home supplies and imports of timber, may be properly safeguarded.Since the Committee agreed upon the preceding section of our&quot;Report it has been suggested to us that there is some possibility that a new Ministry may be formed which would embrace the existing departments of agriculture of England and Wales, and of Scotland, and possess wider powers on all questions of rural land development than are possessed by those departments. If action were taken on these lines, the views which we have expressed above would be to some extent modified. Though we should still be in favour of a single Forest Authority for the United King-dom, we think that a satisfactory basis for forest administration in Great Britain might be reached if a strong department in the Ministry were set up for forestry, responsible for all forestry questions in England and Wales and Scotland, and only responsible to the Minister&apos; in charge.XII. THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF AFFORESTATION.We have set out (pp. 25-29) the reasons why it is necessary to undertake affores-tation operations on a large scale, and we desire now to investigate the probable results which will be obtained if planting is regarded purely as a business undertaking.0!The profit or loss which is incurred in afforestation is clearly the difference between the cost of producing timber and the amount realised for it. The cost of production depends on the value of the land planted, the cost of planting the trees and the out-goings in rearing the plantation; while the amount realised for the timber depends on the volume produced and its value per cubic foot. Since a very considerable period elapses between the time of, planting a wood and the realisation of the timber, it is necessary to make all the calculations at compound interest and for the same time. The factors which enter into the calculations cannot aU be assessed with equal accuracy, and unfortunately, those which exercise the most potent influences, viz., the probable price of a particular kind of timber 40 to 80 years hence and the rate of interest which may fairly be used, can be determined with the least accuracy. On the other hand, the value of land will be known before it is planted and fair estimates can be made, on the basis of experience, of the cost of planting and tending the plantations and of the probable yield in volume of timber. We have stated the case in this way in order to show that emphatic.. statements that afforestation will prove, in the direct financial sense, highly remunerative or the reverse are to be received with caution.There is a further difficxilty which we have to meet. Yield tables (i.e., statements showing the production of timber for a given species) are, for technical reasons, compiled from measurements of comparatively small and selected crops of timber which have developed, in a normal way, and represent consequently an ideal which we cannot expect to see realised over large areas. Damage from fire, wind or insects is bound to occur in the best regulated forests, space is lost owing to roads, rides and unplantable patches, and similarly it is unavoidable in planting that the selection of the kind of tree: with reference to the silvicultural conditions is sometimes unhappy. The net result of . aU these factors, is that in practice the maximum efficiency of production as indicated by yield tables is not realised over large areas.We liaVe, therefore, attacked the problem in the following way : we have first drawn up for five kinds of conifers, which are likely to be widely used in afforestation, tables showing the production, in thinnings and final fellings, which should be obtained on land of average quality for the particular; species, if development wereTJ   4656 - 1
normal or equal to 100 per cent, efficiency. We have placed on the timber prices which&apos; have been realised before the war under proper methods of utilisation. Estimates were then made as to the average cost of planting and tending the woods, and the relation between the yield per cent, on invested capital and the price which can be paid for the land&apos;was determined. The estimates made and the methods of working out these results are set out in detail in Appendix 7.Having made the calculations on what may be called the basis of maximum efficiency, we have then proceeded to make a fresh calculation allowing for an efficiency of 70 per cent. It will be observed from the appendix that the average production of the five species taken is slightly over 100 cubic feet per acre per annum, and this figure reduced by 30 per cent, gives a mean production of 70 cubic feet per acre per annum, which is, in fact, the figure which we have taken (p. 34) for estimating the area which should be afforested.The results of the two sets of calculations are summarised in the table below.:     -:   &apos;     -----Table showing the Relation between the Price which may be paid for Land and the probable yleld per cent. on capital invested in afforestation.Return per cent, (on pre-War Values of Timber) when afforested withWhenthe LandcostsDouglas Fir.Larch.Sitka Spruce.   iCommon Spruce.Scots Pine.Average of the five Species.Return per cent, for Common Spruce (Timbervalued at Id.per cub. ft.above pre-War Prices).per Acre	100 per cent. effi-ciency.	70 jercent.	100 Der cent.	70 aercent. effl-ciency.	100 per cent. effi-ciency.	70   I   100 per cent.jper cent. effi-   !   effi-ciency. i ciency.		70 per cent. effi-ciency..	100 percent. effi-ciency.	70 per cent. effi-ciency.	100 per cent.	70 percent.	70 per cent, efficiency.		effi-ciency.	effi-ciency.										 													1	5-6	4-8	5-2	4-4	4-4	3-8	3-4	2-8	3-5	3-0	4-4	3-8	3-22	5-4	4-6	5-0	4/2	4-2	3-6	3-4	2-7	3-4	2-9	4-3	3-6	3-13	5-3	4-5	4-8	4-0	4-1	3-5	3-3	2-6	3-3	2-8	4-2	3-5	3-0i	5-1	4-3	4-7	3-9	4-0	3-4	3-2	2-5	3-2	2-7	4-0	3-4	2-95	5-0	4-2	4-5	3-8	3-9	3-3	3-1	2-5	3-1	2-6	3-9	3-3	2-86	4-9	4-1	4-4	3-6	3-8	3-2	3-0	2-4	3-0	2-5	3-8	3-2	2-77	4-8	4-0	4-3	3-5	3-7	3-1	2-9	2-3	2-9	2-5	3-7	3-1	2-6.   8	4-7	3-9	4-2	3-4	3-6	3-0	2-9	2 2	2:9	2-4	3-7	3-0	2-69	4-6	3-8	4-1	3-4	3-5	3-0	2-8	2-2	2-8	2-3	3-6	2-9	2-510	4-5	3-7	4-0	3-3	3-5	2-9	2-8	2-1	2-7	2-3	3-5	2-9	2-415	4-1	3-3	3-6	2-9	3-2	2-6	2-5	1-9	2-4	2-0	3-2	2-5	2-220	3-8	3-0	3-4	2-6	2-9	2-3	2-3	 	2-2	 	2-9	 	2-025	3-5	2-8	3-1	2-4	2-7	2-1	2-1	 	2-1	 -	2-7	 	 30	3-3	2-6	2-9	2-3	2-6	2-0	2-0	_	1-9	 	2-5	 	 The above figures, having been obtained by allowing compound interest on all returns and outgoings from the date when they would be received or expended, indicate that a reduction on the efficiency of production does not reduce propor-tionately the return per cent, with land of a given value. The average reduction all round produced by substituting the 70 per cent, for the 100 per cent, calculation of return is y^ths of one per cent., reducing the return on the average of the five species on 51. land, for example, from 3&apos; 9 per cent, to 3&apos; 3 per cent. Confining our attention to the 70 per cent, efficiency figures, we see that the maximum percentage is 4*8 with Douglas fir on land costing 11. per acre, and this suggests at once that profitable afforestation with the high rates of interest now ruling, if timber prices remain at their pre-war level, is likely to prove the exception rather than the rule. The figures with which we are more particularly interested, however, are those for land costing from 3L to 61. per acre. With 31. land Douglas fir should yield 4&apos; 5 per cent., common spruce 2 * 6 per cent., and the five species on the average, 3&apos; 5 per cent. On 61. land, the figures are: Douglas fir, 4&apos;1 percent.; common spruce, 2&quot; 4 per cent.; average, 3/2 per cent. It will also be observed that at such prices a change of 11. in the cost of the land makes a difference of about T]oth per cent, in the rate, of interest.
In order to illustrate further the relation between the price which may, oh the data we have taken, be paid for land for afforestation with the different species, and the rate of interest-which-may be expected on invested capital we have also represented graphically below the results of our calculations on the 70 per cent, efficiency basis. It will be seen from the curves that the prices which may be paid for the land diminish much more rapidly than the rates of interest increase, and that if the rate of interest is raised high enough, no one could grow trees at a profit unless he were paid to use the land.-5 0        4-5 10        15        20        25       30        35        40Price which, may be paid for the Land, in Pounds per Acre.Diagram showing the probable Rate op Interest obtainable on Invested Capital on Afforesting Land of different Values with certain Species.From the assumption as to yields of timber and timber prices which we have made, two conclusions may therefore clearly be drawn: first, that at pre-war prices no extensive afforestation policy can be carried out without loss on the high interest rates which are now ruling, and secondly, that if it were agreed that the work of afforestation should be governed by calculations based on a fixed rate of interest, that rate could not be varied by so much as one-half per cent, without altering radically the basis on which land was being acquired. There would arise, in fact, under a system of &quot;financial control of this kind periods of activity or the. reverse in planting operations, according as the rate of interest were low or high,&apos;:;:&apos; and similarly a variation in the kind of trees planted. It is hardly necessary to point out that such fluctuations would strike at the root of the system of progressive afforestation which we have in view, and we think it desirable to set out the reasons why we prefer a system of control for obviously there must be some control which should be placed on the operations of the Forest Authority as an alternative to a hard and fast requirement of a definite rate of interest on all sums expended.To illustrate the effect on the financial results even of a slight rise in prices we have made a second calculation for common spruce, increasing the prices of timber throughout by Id. per cubic foot, but leaving the estimated production in volume unaltered. Such an increase might easily be effected by improved means of com-munication or methods of utilisation as distinct from movements in general market prices. The result of this increase, which is indicated both in the table and the diagram! above, is to raise the price which may be paid for land on a 3 per cent, rate of interest from minus 10s. to 60s. per acre. This increase for spruce corresponds to an increase of 19 per cent, on its price. In the 18 years before the war the average increase in timber prices was 33 per cent.   The probability of a further rise* It is impossible to say wbat the rate of interest will be during a period of, say, 80 years. Towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars British Consols stood at 58, giving over 5 per cent, interest, la 1899 they stood at 112, giving barely 2\ per cent., and now they give once more close on 5 per cent. Similar fluctuations may again occur during the next 80 years.f In the diagram&apos;the firm line for Common Spruce has been obtained by making the calculations at pre-war prices, and the broken line by using prices Id. per cubic foot above pre-war prices,12
is an important point which should not be ignored in any discussion of the financial returns from forestry.But, apart from the question of the prices which are likely to be realised for timber some 80 or more years hence in an unrestricted market, our proposals are directed towards a much more important object, namely, national safety. We have already shown on p. 21 that the nation has paid for wood and timber during 1915 and 1916 some 37,000,000Z. more than it would have paid for the same material just before the war. Such a sum would cover several times over any possible loss which could be incurred on a well-conducted afforestation scheme, and since by hypothesis a great part of the mature timber which our scheme would provide would be utilised in just such an emergency as the present, it seems only reasonable that considerable weight should be given to this factor when scrutinising our proposals from a financial point of view, and in setting limits to planting operations.We have referred already (p. 27) to the indirect as opposed to the financial results of forests, and it is not necessary to go over the ground again beyond pointing out that such results are of national value and should also be brought broadly into account, although their value is naturally indeterminate.The only other control which is possible, in default of a strictly financial one, is to demand a minimum production of timber from the areas to be afforested. We are strongly of the opinion that this is the rational restriction to impose. If it is adhered to and our other recommendations are carried out, the country will at least accumulate the stock of growing timber which our inquiries have shown to be necessary for safety. On the other hand, a strict financial control will lead indubitably to uncertainty and delay.We recommend, consequently, that the Forest Authority should be guided in their general operations mainly by the following considerations : (1) The land acquired for planting purposes should (a) be uncultivated and incapable of economic reclamation for permanent arable cultivation, and (6) be acquired at a price which is directly related to its limited economic utilisation.(2) The land should be capable of producing a minimum of 40 cubic feet of coniferous timber, including thinnings, per acre per annum.We desire to point out, finally, that the greater part of our imports of wood and timber are Scots pine and spruce. These species give low financial returns compared with larch and Douglas fir, but the home production of them has been of outstanding value during the war, and any system of control which limited their use in afforestation would, in our opinion, be a very great mistake.XIIL-ESTIMATE OF THE SUM REQUIRED TO FINANCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE FOREST AUTHORITY FOR THE FIRST TEN YEARS.We have already stated on p. 64 the reasons why we think it necessary that the Forest Authority should be enabled to draw with certainty on a Fund sufficient to carry it over the first ten years of its operations, and we now propose to form an estimate of the amount which should be placed in the Fund.We have estimated in paragraphs 1-9 below the cost of the additional forestry work which our proposals entail, and we have then estimated the cost of the work which was being carried out before the War by those authorities who were concerned with forestry, and whose work, if our recommendations are followed, will be absorbed by the Forest Authority. We have assumed that the latter amount will be provided from the same sources as hitherto, and consequently have not included it in the total of the Fund.1. The Forest Authority&apos;s Scheme to afforest 150,000 acres with conifers by direct State planting. The total estimated cost is 2,245,000Z. The method of arriving at this amount, which includes 250,0001. for the purchase of sheep stock and acclimatisation values, is explained in Appendix 8.2. Advances to Local Authorities and Private Owners. The details on which the estimate is based are set out on pp. 42-48, and the financial provision which must be made is accordingly as follows : 
Total     -     -     -     -  45,0005. Research and Experiment. In addition to the provision which was made at the beginning of the War, we estimate that a further sum of 3,000Z. per annum will be required. In view of the extensive interests at stake this is not a large sum, but it should be sufficient if the work at the teaching centres is properly correlated and the miscellaneous field experimental work which has been carried out by different departments is centralised.The total estimated cost for the ten years is, therefore, 30,000Z.6. Establishment Charges. We have recommended on pp. 63-64 that a Forestry Commission should be set up, and have outlined the general constitution of that body. Under the head of &quot;Establishment Charges&quot; we include the salaries, travelling expenses, and administrative and executive charges of the Commission, exclusive of the salaries and expenses of the various staffs employed before the war on forestry business.Our estimate on the basis of the probable staff at the middle of the 10-year period is as follows : Salaries of Outdoor Staff: Per Annum.   3 Commissioners -      -      -      -      -      -,-   3,6003 Assistant Commissioners     -     -     -     -     -     -   3,00045 forest officers      -     -     ..     -     -     -     -     - 13,50020,100Salaries of Indoor Staff: &apos;.      ..... .. ....60 officials in all, including Secretary to the Commission,heads of branches and clerks -     -     -     -            - il&apos;nrnTravelling Expenses and Allowances    -     -     -     -     - 12,000Total     - V     &quot;     -     -     &quot;     &quot;  44,600 The total estimated cost for the 10 years is, consequently,  446,000.* See page 44.(a) Grants for re-planting 50,000 acres (at 21, per acre for 45,000  acres of conifers and 4Z. per acre for 5,000 acres of hardwoods) 110,000(6) Grants for afforesting fresh areas, 25,000 acres at 21. per acre - - 50,000(c) Loans&apos;&quot; for planting and replanting, 10,000 acres at 31. per acre 30,000(d) Proceeds-sharing Schemes: State&apos;s contribution towards theafforestation of 25,000 acres at hi. 10s. per acre    t     -     - 137,500Total   . -     -      -     -   327,5003. Purchase and Reconstruction of devastated Hardwood Areas, including cost of replanting and local management. It is difficult to make a close estimate&apos; on this head, as devastation is going on actively and may be accelerated with the progress of the war. As we have explained on p. 35, we have placed the area which the State should acquire at 20,000 acres. The clearing and re-planting of such woodland is likely to prove more costly than planting bare land, and we have, consequently, placed the cost of acquiring the devastated area, planting and local management at 15Z. per acre over the 10-year period.   The total outlay is, therefore, 300,0001.4. Forestry Education: The numbers of men who must be trained in each grade are given on p. 51, and the cost of training each officer is there placed at 150Z. per annum for two years. The net cost of training foresters and foremen, on the basis of experience at the Forest of Dean and Avondale Schools, may be placed at 351. per annum.The total additional cost of education may then be estimated as follows : (a) 45 forest officers at 300Z. each   -     - -     -     -  13,500(6) 150 foresters at 70Z. each - - - -. - - .- 10,500 (c) 600 foremen at 35 . each   -     - -     .  21,000
7. The Encouragement of Forest Industries.-As indicated on page 61, we have recommended that the Forest Authority should be placed in a position to give active encouragement to the development of forest industries ; we do not anticipate any very large expenditure under this head, and we have estimated the amount for the 10-year period at 25,000L8. Summary. The estimated total expenditure may now be summarised as follows : 1. Scheme for afforesting 150,000 acres by direct State         action  -     -            -     -      -      -     - - 2,245,0002. Advances to Local Authorities and private owners - 327,500 3.

Amount of the Forestry Fund. We recommend, therefore, that there be established a Forestry Fund, into which there should be paid either in a lump sum or by instalments, as may be found the more convenient, the sum of 3,425,000Z. to carry the Forest Authority over the first ten years of its existence. We have already referred on p. 64 to the general conditions which should govern the Authority in drawing on the Fund. This sum may appear large if considered only with reference to the area to be planted during this period, but it must be remembered that it includes the survey, the acquisition of land for planting schemes still in their infancy and the whole organisation of an undertaking which extends over eighty years. In future decades the cost will not be nearly so high proportionately to the results achieved.10. Estimate of the Cost of continuing Forestry Work on the pre-War Scale.  Forestry work before the war was financed from four sources : Direct from the Exchequer by way of Parliamentary Vote, from the Endowment Fund of the Depart-ment of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, from the Land Revenues of the Crown, and from the Development Fund.Omitting expenditure from the Land Revenues of the Crown, of which no useful estimate can be made owing to uncertainty as to the amount of replanting which will have to be done in the Crown woods, we estimate the annual expenditure as follows : Payments direct from the Exchequer :  England and Wales - 4,000Scotland - - - - - 1,000 Ireland        -      . -        -        -        -   6,000From the Endowment Fund of the Irish DepartmentFrom the Development Fund : England and Wales - 10,000-   Scotland..... 2,000Ireland         - 1,700Total annual expenditure   -&apos;On this scale the expenditure for 10 years would be 267,000Z. In addition the Treasury has sanctioned, on the recommendation of the Development Commission, certain forestry schemes which we estimate will involve an expenditure of approxi-mately 60.000L during the 10-year period.The total expenditure under this head may consequently be placed at 327,0001.11,000 2,00013,700 26,700
207We desire to express our warm appreciation of the services of our Secretary, Mr. R. L. Robinson. The work of the Sub-Committee has been in many ways arduous and has involved the collection, tabulation and calculation of a great number of figures. It would have been extremely difficult to have accomplished this but for Mr. Robinson&apos;s wide knowledge of forestry in the many different aspects which have presented themselves to us in the course of our proceedings.We desire also to thank Miss Baker King for help given in the preparation of minutes and memoranda, which has entailed a great deal of arduous labour.We are, Sir,Your obedient servants,(Signed)     F.

RESERVATION APPENDED TO HIS SIGNATURE OF THE REPORTBY Mr. L. C. BROMLEY.I am not convinced of the necessity for creating an entirely new central Department to control afforestation in the United Kingdom.Theoretically this might be the proper solution if forestry operations were now being started by the State ah initio. But there is already a Forestry Branch of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, while the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, which was constituted as recently as February 1912, was specially charged with the promotion of forestry in Scotland as one of its most important duties. The Depart-ment of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland has also acquired experience in forestry operations.While there are, of course, certain obvious advantages in the policy of concentra-tion recommended in the body of the Report, such advantages do not appear to me sufficient to justify a reversal of the policy of decentralisation which at present obtains, in regard to afforestation as a part of agricultural policy generally. A separate Forestry Department with a proportion of paid Commissioners and Assistant Commis-sioners at its head, a considerable:subordinate staff which is almost bound to expand rapidly, and a large new central office, is a costly matter, and a multiplication of departments is a thing to be avoided except upon the clearest evidence of necessity. It appears to me that the requirements of the extended afforestation policy recom-m ended which does not necessarily raise problems different in kind from those already presenting themselves to the respective Boards could be sufficiently met by-some further strengthening and improvement of the status of the existing Forestry Branches of those Boards ; with the addition, no doubt, of the requisite officers to control the actual field operations in the&apos; various countries, who would be equally necessary under either system.The difficulty of apportioning the yearly afforestation programme to be carried on in the various countries will, it appears to me, be by no means solved by the institu-tion of a single authority situated in London to control operations, for example, in Scotland. But I see no reason why, if the control of operations be left in the hands of the existing Departments, suitably strengthened for the purpose, the programme for each year should not be determined by means of a joint Committee consisting of the heads or selected representatives of the three Departments (say, the principal officers of the Forestry Branches). The amount of afforestable land in each country having been determined by the survey, it would seem to be perfectly feasible to work out in collaboration a rough scheme of the operations to be undertaken over a given period. And assuming that Parliament is prepared to vote an amount to cover afforestation operations over such given period, it ought not to be difficult to apportion for the purposes of an estimate the amounts which would be required by each Department for each ensuing year.Any amount which might be voted by Parliament to meet the needs of the Board of Agriculture (England), Board of Agriculture (Scotland), and Department of Agricul-ture (Ireland), over a period of years, would then be drawn upon by each Department to the extent recommended by the Central Committee and approved by the Treasury, any amount unexpended in any year by either- of the three Departments becoming available for redistribution.In any case, no step which would result in a further multiplication of departments a,nd the creation of a large and expensive staff should be taken without the most careful consideration.With regard to the rest of the recommendations contained in the Report, I agree that the scheme suggested would provide the best means of securing the conservation and development of the woodland and forestry resources of the United Kingdom (having regard more particularly to their importance as a safeguard in the event of a possible future war on a similar scale to the present), and have signed the Report accordingly. It must be admitted, however, that the expenditure proposed is very considerable and that the financial results are likely to be unfavourable to the Exchequer; and it is to be doubted how far the claims of afforestation are such as could demand priority among the many urgent claims which are likely to be brought against the Exchequer upon the conclusion of the war.(Signed)     L. C. BROMLEY.
208RESERVATION APPENDED TO HIS SIGNATURE OF THE REPORT BYLORD LOVAT.While I agree in all. essential particulars with the Forestry Committee^ Report which I have signed, I think it is my duty to insist, with perhaps more emphasis than my colleagues have seen fit to do, on the importance of a single Forest Authority for Great Britain.I consider it necessary to speak out plainly on this point, because I am satisfied that the methods of the past have failed either to meet existing Forestry requirements or to prepare the way for a policy of State afforestation, and because 1 see no reason, -with the existing machinery, why better results can be expected in the future.In looking over the last 20 years of inquiry and inaction, the three facts connected with forestry which stand out most prominently are: The absence of any recognised authority.to lead ;The blind groping after a settled policy ; andThe failure to tackle the larger issues on adequate lines.Inquiries and reports have been made, Royal Commissions and Departmental Committees have sat, money has been voted for Development Commissions, Boards of Agriculture, &amp;c, yet the position of Great Britain remains the same the only country in Europe without a forest policy, without a State forest, and, above all, without a Forest Authority.With no properly accredited body who could give authoritative rulings as to forest values, the spending departments in the different countries of the British Isles have taken ideas piecemeal out of Royal Commissions or Departmental Inquiries, not because they were valuable in themselves, nor because they were part of an ordered scheme of progress, but because either they were the: special hobby of an enthusiast, -because they met a section of hostile criticism, or because they could be carried out without political opposition.Forest officers have been trained without forests to put them into when trained. Surveys have been begun in one country and neglected in another. There has been no correlation of Jwork, no co-operation in research, no system of training tending to build up a SchooL of Forestry specially useful for the British Isles. ,It is with no wish to criticise what has been done in the past, but in order to point out the impossibility of progress under divided management that attention is called to the forest history of Scotland in the last 10 years. The example of Scotland is taken because from the forestry, point of view Scotland is important, as it contains some three million acres devoted to sport, and has more land suitable for silviculture than in the whole of the rest of the British Isles, and, according to the reports of the leading foresters of Europe (vide Transactions of the Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society, Vol. XXVIII., p. 183), can be regarded as an area second to none in Europe for forestry development.The sum total of work done in Scotland by the Development Commission and the Scottish Board of Agriculture, both of whom have moneys voted by Parliament and are especially charged with afforestation, amounts to the survey of a single county, the creation of two forest gardens, a little money spent on buildings, a few forest officers trained in forestry (few, if any, of whom are employed in the country), and trivial advances of money to public authorities for planting purposes. A proud record of achievement, and one which, taken in conjunction with the fact that many private owners have ceased to plant while all owners continue to. fell, leaves the country, as regards a timber reserve, considerably worse off than before the much talked of period of State forest activity began.It is not necessary to enlarge on the action of Departments in other parts of the British Isles. It is broadly true to say that under existing management the State has failed to stay the denuding of the forest resources of Great Britain, or to make methodical preparation for State afforestation in the future.The creation of a single forest authority for the British Isles is required Firstly, and principally, to make a definite break with the past, to get out ofthe welter of conflicting authorities and to escape from the arena of partypolitics, Royal Commissions and amateur inquiries. Secondly, to make it possible for an accredited authority not Only to draw up adefinite forestry policy for the British Isles, but also to set in motion themachinery for carrying it into effect.U  4656 fr
Thirdly, to constitute a body who can view the forestry situation in Great Britain as a whole, and decide on purely forestal grounds the conflicting claims of the various countries unbiassed by local or political pressure.Fourthly, to constitute a body who, in time of war, could act with the Military Authorities to exploit both State and private forests for the benefit of the country.The first three points have been dealt with in the Report. It is only necessary to say about the fourth point that in France at the beginning of the War a central Forest Authority existed, the resources of each forest were known; the transport facilities, railway sidings and light railways had all been studied in times of peace, with the result that the maximum.of production was possible with the minimum of effort.Forest utilisation in England at the beginning of the war presented a very different picture. It was twelve months before the Government improvised machinery to deal with the subject. By this time many of the skilled men had already enlisted. Mills were to be found without men, men were to be found without mills. Forest workers were badged and de-badged at uncertain intervals. Departments competed for labour, while German prisoners,. skilled in forest work, were unemployed for months, and, after their employment, tied down with such regulations as to make their work relatively unproductive.Even the responsibility for the organisation on timber production was never vested in one authority for many consecutive months, but changed from the Board of Agriculture to the Office of Works, from the Office of Works to the War Office, and from the War Office to the Board of Trade. The fault for all this is to be found in lack of organisation before the War. Nothing had been thought out, no authoritative body existed in whom the public had confidence. It was impossible to execute a survey of timber resources and build up an organisation once the War had begun.It is not, however, with the past but with the future that the nation is concerned. How to make a forest policy, how to carry it out, and, if the occasion arises, use the resources that the State has built up for the State&apos;s best advantage.Both in precept and practice the countries of Europe, the teachings of all recognised authorities and the findings of the principal arboricultural societies, not only in Great Britain but elsewhere, have agreed that a forest authority is a necessary part of State afforestation.It is difficult to see why Great Britain, who has her State forests and forest policy still to create, should be an exception to this generally recognised rule. It is certainly not on the experiences of the past that she can base any claim to be an exception from the methods that have been found to.be necessary elsewhere.(Signed)     LOVAT.

APPENDIX 1.MEMORANDA RECEIVED PROM SOCIETIES INTERESTED INFORESTRY.The Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society.Statement by the Council regarding Afforestation.The following statement contains the recommendations of the Council of the Royal Scottish Arbori-cultural Society regarding afforestation, in reply to a letter from the Secretary of the Forestry Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee, asking for an expression of their views on the subject.1. Need for Action by Government.After the reports of a Royal Commission on Forestry and of more than one Departmental Committee on the subject, it would be superfluous to :discuss either the heed for further afforestation, or the duty of the Government to assist in the work. The simple fact that we spent more than 40,000,0007. in 1913 upon imported wood, is sufficient to show, both the enormous extent to which the home-grown supply falls short of our requirements, and the impossibility of expecting private effort to make up the deficiency.The question has attracted a good deal of attention in recent years, and all who have studied it have been struck by the great loss which the nation suffers in paying away to foreigners immense sums of money which might be retained in the country for the benefit of its own people. And since the war began we have had occasion to feel that our reliance upon foreign countries for such a large proportion of our timber : requirements is not only a material loss but a source of danger.How dependent we are upon wood is, perhaps, not sufficiently appreciated. It is not too much to say that civilised life could not go on without it. The amount required by railways, collieries, and other vital industries is gigantic ; and to tnese must now be added the enormous consumption of wood in modern warfare. To induce the Government to embark upon a policy of afforestation stress is often laid upon the &apos; fact that national forests would prove a source of revenue. Judging from the published accounts of French ( and German forests, and from the experience of landowners in this country whose Avoods have been scientifically managed, there can be little doubt that this would eventually be the case. But it is not on this ground, that.the decisipn of. the Government should be based. The true justification for national afforestation is the well-being and security of the country. Wood is one of the prime necessaries of life. Next to food, it is the article of which an abundant supply: is most essential tp the nation. It is on this ground that foreign governments have recognised their responsibility in the matter ; and it is on this ground also that we hope our Government will decide to do the same.The country has been informed that it is the intention of the Government to make every available acre of land productive. This can only be done with the aid of afforestation. There are, no doubt, thousands of acres of agricultural land, now neglected, which are capable of being profitably cultivated. But beyond these, there are millions of acres of waste land capable of being profitably planted. Unless the Government will assist in planting them, one of the greatest natural resources of the country must remain undeveloped.The benefits of national afforestation may be summarised as follows : (1) It would turn many barren wastes into profitable woodlands.(2) It would retain, in the rural districts, thousands of men who now have to seek employment in the towns.(3) It would keep in this country, for the benefit of the country, millions of pounds now paid away to foreigners.(4) It would enable a large number of small holdings to be established on economic lines. (5) It would lead to the development of many new industries.(6) It would ensure such a supply of timber as would enable British industries to be carried on, without curtailment and without anxiety, in the event of another great war.2: Extent of State Afforestation.A preliminary point to settle is the extent of afforestation which would be required. It would be quite possible to make the country self-supporting in the matter of timber. The reports of the Royal Commission and Departmental Committees show that the amount of available land is more than sufficient for the purpose ; while competent authorities assure us that our soil and climate will produce every variety of timber in common use, and of a quality equal to that which comes to us from abroad.It would not be necessary, however, to make ourselves entirely self-supporting. It would probably be sufficient to make such an increase in our existing woodlands as would substantially diminish the amount which we now pay annually for imported timber, and enable us, in the event of another great war, to carry on for three years without unduly depleting our home supplies. To ensure this our present woodlands should be increased by two million acres. The wooded area of the United Kingdom is estimated at 3,000,000 acres : it should be increased to 5,000,000 acres.The annual consumption of timber in the United Kingdom before the war was about 650,000,000 cubic feet. Of this amount only about one-eighth was grown at home. Under an improved system of silviculture the existing woodlands in the country would yield fully twice their present output. The additional 2,000,000 acres, scientifically managed, could be counted on to yield 150,000,000 cubic feet. We should thus obtain from the afforested land in this country something over 300,000,000 cubic feet annually, or one-half the volume of present consumption instead of only one-eighth,
We do not say that an addition of 2,000,000 acres to the area now under timber would fully meet the needs of the country, especially when we remember how the demand for timber has steadily increased; but we consider that this is the lowest figure which should be aimed at in any scheme of national afforestation.3. Joint Action by State, and Landowners.Afforestation should be carried out, partly by the State, and partly by private owners of land. There is no doubt that the work would be more cheaply done if landowners were encouraged to take a part in it In the first place, where the work was done by landowners, the State would be relieved of all expense connected with the purchase or leasing of the land to be planted. And in the second place, owners already possess much experience in planting and managing woods, and they employ a large number of men trained in the arts of forestry. It would obviously, therefore, be an advantage to associate landowners, as far as possible, with any scheme of afforestation. The extent of afforestation contemplated is, of course, too large to enable them to undertake more than a limited share of it. But it would be worth while for the State to offer inducements to them to make the share as large as possible. These inducements should take two forms (1) the removal of discouragements to planting ; and (2) the offer of substantial encouragements.Discouragements.The chief discouragement to planting is due to the burden of Imperial and local taxation. These two combined always amount to a very large proportion of the annual value of the land. At the present rate of taxation they often exceed 20j. in the  , as can be proved by concrete instances. Such instances no doubt include super-tax ; but it must be remembered that super-tax will invariably be payable on estates where planting could be done on a large scale. Unless this burden were lightened, it would not be possible for landowners to take any considerable part in the work of afforestation.Local Taxation. In Scotland the local rates are paid partly by the owner and partly by the occupier. Where land is let for pasture, the owner pays one-half of the rates and the occupier the other half. If the land is taken for planting, the owner not only gives up the rent he has been receiving, buc he has to pay&apos; a double share of rates (as owner and occupier). As long as the land was in the farmer&apos;s hands, his rates were reduced by the Agricultural Rates grant; but the rates on the same land have to be paid in full as soon as the owner uses it for planting. These three things combined loss of rent, payment of double rate, loss of the benefit of the agricultural grant operate as a distinct discouragement to afforestation. In any reform of local taxation, the matter should be considered and set right. In the meantime this discouragement could be partially removed by putting silviculture on the same footing as agriculture, and making the Agricultural Grant apply to all land used for growing timber for profit.Income Tax. Similar discouragement is caused in the case of income tax. Where land is left in agricultural occupation, and let to a tenant, the owner escapes all income tax under Schedule B. But as soon as he takes the land into his own hands and plants it, he becomes liable in respect of it to both income tax and super-tax. It is obvious that, with income tax and super-tax at present rates, this is bound to be a deterrent to planting.To some extent the burden has been diminished by the provisions of Section 22 (I) of the Finance Act, 1915, which gives the owner the right, as regards existing woodlands managed on a commercial basis, to be assessed under Schedule D instead of Schedule B. The profits however, under Schedule D are to;be based on a three years&apos; average only, which is too short a period in the ease of timber crops : it should be at least five years.Under Section 38, Sub-section (2) of the Finance Act, 1916, the owner may claim to have all replanted or newly planted areas treated as &quot;woodlands ou a separate estate,&quot; and assessed under Schedule D. This clearly gives immunity for income tax (but only as regards occupancy) until such time as the crop of timber begins to be saleable. The concession is certainly a valuable one, provided that all the expenses of planting and maintenance are allowed to be deducted before profits are reckoned. Otherwise the benefit is illusorv. As there is some doubt upon the point, it should be cleared up without delay.Death Duties. Timber, like every other kind of property, is subject to the Death Duties, and, under ordinary circumstances, there would be no ground for seeking exemption from it. But the State never dies ; and if the State is to own forests, and to compete with private individuals in the sale of its timber, it will have au unfair advantage unless some change is made. It will therefore be necessary, either that standing timber should be exempted from payment of Death duties, or that the.State should cousent to be taxed for an equivalent sum every twenty or thirty years.Encouragements. The reasons for the encouragements suggested are : 1. That every acre of land planted is a gain to the country, and that this gain can be obtained more cheaply by inducing owners to plant than by the State buying the land and doing the-planting itself.2. That an immense quantity of timber has been felled to meet national requirements during the war, without any corresponding planting having been done; and that it is necessary to stimulate replanting.3. That many persons who would be willing to plant are not in a financial position to do so ; whilst others are not prepared to incur the whole loss of an outlay for which they cannot expect any return during their lifetime. . : ;4. That from 2\ per cent, to 3 per cent, is all the return that can be counted on for money invested in planting, and that for this return the planter must wait many years, whereas he cau obtain an immediate return of 5 per cent, if he invests his money in other ways. That, therefore, if the State desires him on national grounds to invest his money in planting, it mustvoffer him some compensation for doing so. -    &apos;*-&apos; &apos; . ;K 3
&apos;; The following are suggested as inducements which might prove effective ; aud they should be given equally for the renewal of old plantations and the creation of new ones : ]. A bonus of 11. 10s. per acre for every acre planted the only condition in this case being an undertaking on the part of the owner that the trees selected shall be suitable, the planting properly done, and the young plants protected against damage by rabbits. 2. A bonus of 31. for every acre planted.   In this case, besides the above-mentioned conditions, the Government would have, in the event of war, the first claim to the timber, at the average price .. of the three preceding years. 3. An advance of the whole sum required for planting, to be repaid, capital and interest, by annual instalments spread over a considerable period.   This method may be preferred by a certain number of landowners, though the number may not be great at present owing to the high rate of interest prevailing.4. Method of Acquiring Land.Where afforestation is undertaken by the State, the land required for the purpose could be obtained either by purchase or lease.   There is no reason why both methods should not be employed.Purchase would be the simpler and more natural method. It would allow the State an absolutely free haud in dealing with the property, and would avoid all possible disputes and legal complications. The chief objection to it would seem to be the large initial cost. It might also be argued that the money might be better employed in getting on at once with the actual work of afforestation.&apos; If land were leased by the State for afforestation, the lease should be a perpetual one, or something approaching to perpetuity. The land would then practically become the property of the State at a fixed annual rent, the sporting rights being reserved to the owner, unless the State should prefer to acquire them.The State should have the right to put an end to the lease at any time, if the land were to prove unsuited for profitable planting. In that event, the lessor should have the option of having the land restored to him, either with the standing timber, or with the timber removed.- : On the other hand, the lessor should also have the right to put an end to the lease at any time, on paying to the State the market value of.the standing timber.The question of giving the State compulsory powers for the acquisition of land need not be discussed at present. There will be no difficulty in obtaining, by voluntary agreements, all the land that will be required to start with. It will be soon enongh to consider compulsion when voluntary arrangements show signs of failing. By that time the nation will have become committed to the policy of afforestation, and will have seen the work in progress ; and the Government would find no difficulty in carrying public opinion with them in any measures that might be necessary.5. Small Holdings.Where the State acquires land for afforestation, it is desirable that there should be included in the area, as often as possible, a certain amount of land capable of being adapted to small holdings. It is generally admitted that the creation of small holdings, where there is a prospect of their being profitably worked, is an object of importance ou national grounds ; and we are of opinion that in Scotland small holdings would be most profitably worked in connection with afforestation. The small holder would then not be entirely dependent upon his holding, but would be certain of regular employment at good wages during the winter months, when his farm required little attention. Afforestation and small holdings should therefore be con-sidered together when land is being acquired. There are a great many farms in Scotland which contain a small proportion of cultivated land and a large proportion of unreclaimed grazing land. In such cases the joint purpose would be effected if the State were to acquire the whole farm, utilising the cultivated portion for small holdings and the remainder for planting.6. Surveys.As soon as afforestation is decided upon, the first necessary work will be a survey of the whole country. This at least will be the case in Scotland, where every county contains more or less land available for planting. There should, in the first instance, be a general &quot;Flying Survey&quot; of the whole country, indicating all the waste areas suitable for planting. This would be followed gradually by detailed surveys of selected districts, in which the flying survey had shown that there were suitable areas large enough to be included in a scheme of national afforestation. The Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society have published a detailed survey of the district of Glenmore, showing not only the land which might be profitably planted, but also the way in which such planting would affect the incidence of local taxation, the labour question, and all other existing interests. We consider that any detailed survey undertaken by the Government ought to deal with the problem on similar lines.7. Starting the Work.The immediate expenditure, when embarking upon a policy of afforestation, need not be formidable. As planting can only be gradual, the land need only be acquired gradually. It would not be necessary to have in hand more land than would be required for a few years&apos; operations. If the Forestry Authority made a point of always having enough for the operations of the succeeding ten years, this would probably be sufficient.The surveys, the selection of areas to start upon, the purchase or leasing of the land, the formation of au efficient forestry staff, would occupy some time at the outset. And the actual work of afforestation would be better done if not too much were attempted at first. Planting should be done on a moderate scale for the first few years, advancing in pace as experience was gained and as the supply of trained menwas inernaspriThere would be an advantage in fixing at once upon, a definite extent of afforestation to be aimed at and a definite time within which the work should be completed. The extent might be, as already suggested!
211Memorandum submitted by the Royal English Arboricultural Society/President:The Right Hon. The Lord Barnard, D.C.L.The Council of the Royal English Arboricultural Society has had under consideration the past and present position of Forestry in England and Wales, and the question of the future production of commercial timber.The following statement shows the position : 1. Before the War.The timber supply of Britain was almost entirely obtained from abroad; the price of imported timber Timberwas low and the cost of transport small.   Home-grown timber was generally in small request except for supplies.estate purposes, fencing and certain special or inferior uses.   When sold the prices realised were such that,in many cases, the timber did not pay to grow and the cost of transport was high.-.-.-.-.---* The Sub-Committee are informed that this Memorandum has been submitted, at their request, before it has been finally approved by the Society. \.     , , .....K 12 million acres, and the time 80 years. Planting might then start at the rate of 5 to 10,000 acres annually for the first ten years ; rising, as circumstances permitted, to a rate which would ensure the work being fully carried out within the prescribed period.8. Forestry Authority.If afforestation is to be carried out on a national scale, it will require to be placed under the control of an Authority whose sole business it will be to attend to it. The present position of forestry under the Board of Agriculture has proved unsatisfactory at least in Scotland for various reasons, and a change is urgently needed.We are strongly of opinion that the best policy would be to create a separate Forestry Department for the whole of the United Kingdom. This would ensure a uniform policy and system of management for all parts of the kingdom, and a fair allotment to each country of work to be done and grants to be received. The actual work of afforestation would not be large at first, and might seem insufficient for a State Department, but it would require much forethought and preparation ; and when once begun, it would grow rapidly in magnitude and importance.The work can only be properly planned and successfully executed under the guidance of someone who is himself an expert in forestry ; and you are seldom likely to be able to place at the head of the Board of Agriculture a man who is at the same time an acknowledged expert in farming and in foreetry. It would, therefore, seem more business-like to separate the two subjects, and to place forestry under a Department of its own, where it will be under the direction of men who have made it their special study. And we would add that, since the subject is such a technical one, those who are selected as competent to deal with it should be allowed a wide discretion, and not have their hands tied by restrictious or regulations beyond those that are considered necessary to ensure due economy.Since the conditions affecting afforestation are obviously different in the different parts of the United Kingdom, it would probably be desirable that the Forestry Department should consist of three branches, with offices situated in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and a small Central Controlling Authority.The duties of the Central Authority avouIu be : 1, To form a comprehensive scheme of afforestation for the United Kingdom.2. To allot to each of the three branches their separate shares in working out the scheme.3. To consider and sanction plans laid before them by the branches.4. To see that schemes were carried out in accordance with a consistent plan.5. To allot to the three branches the sums provided by Parliament in proportion to the work done.6. To authorise the purchase or leasing of land. 7. To have the direction of forestry education.8. To see that efficient steps were taken in each country for training a sufficient number of foresters.The duties of the Branch Departments would be :  1. To carry out the preliminary surveys.2. To advise the Central Authority on  questions  of purchase or leasing iu their respective areas.3. To prepare schemes for planting suitable fo the various areas selected.4. To carry out such schemes when they have been sanctioned by the Central Authority.5. To obtain and record all necessary statistics.6. To be responsible for the disposal of timber in the woods under their control.Should there prove to be objections of which we are unaware against the creation of a Stale Department for forestry, and should it be deemed advisable for forestry to remain under the Board of Agriculture, we consider it essential that there should be a branch of the Board dealing with forestrv alone, and provided with a separate staff and a separate fund. This point has frequently been urged in the past by the Eoyal Scottish Arboricultural Society, and a promise was given by the Secretary for Scotland, as long ago as 1911, that the desired change would be made, but the promise remains unfulfilled. Failing an independent Forestry Department, it will he necessary that some such change should be carried out.24dh February 1917.
English Wood-lands!.The Crown Woods.Private woods.The Society&apos;s work.State Affores-tation.v-ix The woodlands of England and Wales extended over about 1,884,000 acres. Had they been normally stocked they should have produced about a load of timber per acre per annum, but there being little demand for the produce the output was very small.The Crown Woods extended over about 64,000 acres. They were managed to some extent, for the production of commercial timber, but the management of the past had been such that the balance of annual income over anuual expenditure, if any, was trifling. The appearance of the woods and the results obtained did much to discourage planting by private owners. The management of the Crown woods was hindered by common rights and the New Forest Act, 1877.The woods in private hands extended over about 1,820,000 acres. They were partly the remains of ancient forests and manorial wastes, and were often hampered by rights of common and of way. Many areas were devoted to the growth of coppice, or coppice with standards, which, a generation ago, were lucrative systems of forestry, but are now no longer remunerative owing to the decay of rural industries and the lack of the demand for firewood, bark and other produce. This had a very depressing influence on forestry, and but for the value of the woods for game preservation, for shelter, and for ornament, much larger areas of woodland would probably have been cleared wherever the land was good enough for other uses. In many districts where the land was valuable for corn growing there was little woodland except on large estates.It. must be admitted that, in many cases, the production of commercial timber was neglected, in consequence of, amongst other reasons, financial stringency owing to agricultural depression : neglect, on the part of successive Governments to foster and encourage the industry ; ignorance of sylviculture! methods ; foreign competition ;,and above all, the poor prospect of a profitable return upon the expenditure involved.In other cases, although the process was unremunerative, landowners had spent large sums in planting their woods for the production of commercial timber, but they suffered great loss from rabbits, injurious insects and fungi, and from fire, gales, frost, drought, &amp;c. Private owners were also severely handicapped by the low price of the produce; the bad markets for British timber; heavy railway rates; the rings formed by timber buyers ; claims for extraordinary traffic in carting timber over the highways of the country ; and heavy taxation, especially in the form of Death Duties.The Royal English Arboricultural Society, since its formation in 1882, has endeavoured to represent the opinion of those interested in forestry in England and Wales. Without assistance from the Government the Society has continuously urged the importance of Forestry to the Nation, and has striven to revive an interest in the subject, to improve sylvicultural methods, to extend forestry operations, to encourage the growth of commercial timber, and to raise the industry to a position of gi-eater importance in the timber supply of the country. One of the main objects of the Society has been to do everything possible to establish forestry on sound business lines suited to the varied and peculiar conditions of England and Wales. The improvement of British Forestry is a slow and gradual process, but it will be admitted that in recent years the prospects were more hopeful, and there was a marked and progressive improvement in management. It is submitted that this improvement has been largely due to the work of the Royal English Arboricultural Society.It had been constantly urged that the State should afforest considerable areas of wraste Mountain and Heath land, so as to provide commercial timber and to demonstrate to private owners how woods on such land could be established. Over four years ago the Advisory Committee on Forestry recommended a survey of the country some steps towards making the survey have been commenced otherwise little or nothing has been done.The Demand for Timber.A Stock of Home-grown Timber neces-sary.Tresent time Unfavourable for Legislation., 2. The Present Position.The position of Forestry in Great Britain has been changed by the War. Foreign supplies of timber have been curtailed, and, though building has been stopped, heavy demands for timber have been made by the collieries and by the military suthorities. The demand has to be met by home-grown timber chiefly grown on private estates. It would appear that the stock of good-class ash timber is likely to be exhausted, the stock of conifers dangerously reduced, and other classes greatly diminished.The War has shown that a sufficient stock of home-grown timber is essential, and that a large increase in the production of commercial timber is highly desirable in the National interest. The necessity for large supplies of home-grown timber, and particularly of pitwood in cases of national emergency, has been proved. If foreign imports are stopped, without such home-grown supplies our collieries would cease working, our naval and military operations would be seriously hampered, and many of our commercial undertakings would be ruined. The present supplies have been created mainly at the expense of private owners, without any assistance from the State or encouragement from consumers, and such owners are now supplying their timber at low prices.   The nation is under a great obligation to the timber growers.It would obviously be impracticable during the war to put any scheme into practice, but it is desirable that arrangements should be made for starting operations as soon as Peace is declared. It is, however, essential that a thorough knowledge be had of what land is available for afforestation, so that it may be ready for preparation by demobilized soldiers, sailors, munition workers, and others, after the war, should work be required for them.Future Supplies.British Forestry3. After the War.Owing to the depletion of the stock of home-grown timber the United Kingdom, for many years to come, will be more than ever dependent on foreign supplies.The question of the future of British Forestry will need most careful consideration, but as it takes a long time for timber to come to maturity, there can be no need for hasty and possibly ill-judged action. The main questions requiring consideration will be : (1) The improvement of existing woodlands and the introduction of proper systems of sylvicultural management. .  (2) The re-planting of woods recently felled.(3) The afforestation of areas more suitable for sylvicultural than for any other purpose.
212Wheii the war is over there will be a unique opportunity for the introduction of improved methods for the production of commercial timber. The State should take the fullest advantage of it, by fostering forestry and giving every possible encouragement to the planting of land by private owners. The many serious handicaps to timber growers from which forestry has suffered must be removed before any improve-meut can be expected, measures must be taken to minimize the risk of loss from disease, fire, and atmospheric changes, funds for assistance in planting should be available, and a bonus for planting might be offered. The State must inspire private owners with confidence that their interests will be studied and guarded, and that at least a fair return for the money invested in planting will be assured. The inauguration of a broad and generous policy is essential to the welfare of forestry.The re-planting of the areas upon which timber has been felled both in the Crown Woods and upon private estates will be a matter of some urgency but will be only a partial remedy for the position.The re-planting of private estates, in many cases, will be impossible without financial assistance by the State, aud there must be confidence that planting will result in a profitable return.The afforestation of large areas will be desirable but will probably be difficult to private owners, and afforestation by the State may be necessary, but wherever possible private owners and municipal corporations should be encouraged to carry out extensive schemes as these methods are cheaper to the nation than afforestation by the State.There will be a lack of well trained and skilled persons available to carry out afforestation immediately-after the war, but useful work may be done by unskilled labour if properly directed.The Society, taking these matters into consideration, ventures to submit the following recommendations for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.improved Methods.State assist-ance to private owners.Ee-planting Felled Areas.Afforestation of Larger Areas.Private Owners.Recommendations,1. That the Government, so soon as normal conditions are resumed, should carefully consider methods Encourase. by which the production of commercial timber by private owners may be assisted and encouraged ; ment of0 particularly for ensuring the re-planting of woods which have been felled, the improvement of existing woodlands, and the utilization by afforestation of all land which is better suited for sylviculture than for aujr other purpose.   Among the many items to which attention should be paid the most important are : (a) Reduction of railway rates.(b) Making rings of buyers illegal.(c) Relief from liability for extraordinary traffic in carting timber.(d) Re-adjustment of rates and taxes, especially Death Duties.(e) The provision of a fund from which private owners may borrow money, for afforestation orreplanting, at a low rate of interest, subject to the approval by the State of the plans and management until the loan be repaid.(f) Generous grants for scientific research and supplying information to owners.(g) Making occupiers and occupying owners of adjoining land responsible for keeping down rabbits.(h) Freeing of woodlands and afforestable lands, as far as practicable, from servitudes and other rightsand customs interfering with forestry.(i) Readjusting the   rights   of tenants for life and remaindermen and the legal definition  of&quot; timber.&quot;Forestry Oounccil.2. That it is au essential preliminary to the extension and improvement of forestry that a Forestry Council (unpaid) should be appointed, to be elected by the bodies interested in the subject, and responsible solely to the Minister in charge.3. That a strong department should also be formed aud staffed by men intimately acquainted with English conditions. Such department should at once institute a survey of the country so as to be able to speak and act with authority as to laud suitable respectively for sylvicultural and agricultural development. In making such survey special regard should be paid to land suitable for demonstration areas, and for small agricultural and pastoral holdings iu connection with schemes of afforestation.4. That the Department should, with local assistance, mark out areas of suitable land for afforestation, so that in the event of work being required for demobilized soldiers and sailors after the war, the Govern-ment may be prepared to acquire the land by purchase or lease, and to commence work of reclamation preliminary to afforestation, such as clearing aud draining the land, road-making, &amp;c, for which labour skilled in forestry is not necessary.5. That in the event of a large scheme of State afforestation being decided upon, the Government should institute a more extensive system of education for all branches of forest service than is available at present.Q. That every encouragement should be given to municipal and other local authorities to afforest land, especially in connection with catchment areas for water supply schemes.7. That the State should lay out demonstration areas and generally carry out the recommendations of the Royal English Arboricultural Society dated 1910, which were embodied in the Report of the Advisory Committee on Forestry, 1913 (Cd. 6713).8. That Crown woods and forests should be so managed in future as to be a good example for the Crown Woods, production of commercial timber upon profitable lines.EDWARD DAVIDSON, Secretary.

33, Queeii Street, Edinburgh. - March 1917.Memorandum in reply to the Letter of 8th February 1917 received from the Secretary of the Forestry Committee of the Reconstruction Committee inviting the Society&apos;s views.In response to the request from the Forestry Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee, the Landowners&apos; Co-operative Forestry Society have pleasure in submitting the following Memorandum.The Society was inaugurated some years ago to meet the need felt by many proprietors of woodlands for the co-operative sale of timber and forestry products, and the purchase of plants, seeds, and all requisites connected with forestry. These objects have been to some considerable extent attained, and the business of the Society has grown enormously, especially iu the last two years.It may be desirable to explain the class of the work carried out by the Society in order that the Committee may know the nature of the information before the Society when making the following criticisms and recommendations.The Landowners&apos; Co-operative Forestry Society, Ltd., has a membership of over 400 landowners in Scotland, and the work undertaken for members is as follows :-1. Selection and purchase of plants and seeds.2. Advising as to planting and replanting of areas.3. Inspecting and reporting oh woodlands and advising as to selling.4. Marking, classifying, and counting of trees.5. Valuation of standing timber preparatory to selling.6. Sale of standing, manufactured and semi-manufactured timber.7. Generally to advise members on all questions relating to forestry operations.For this work the Society employ four experienced foresters and an office staff.While the Society&apos;s objective is thus mainly a commercial oue, it nevertheless claims to have kept iu view the best national interests in the management of existing woodlands and the extension of the forest area in Scotland. The inquiry from the Reconstruction Committee is for the Society&apos;s views upon &quot;the best means of conserving and developing woodlands and forestry resources of the United Kingdom.&quot; The broader aspects of the question so far as relating to Scotland have been already dealt with in a Memorandum submitted by the Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society. The Co-operative Society has seen that Memorandum and is in agreement with its terms, and it is not therefore proposed to traverse any of the same ground. Certain other aspects relating to practical forestry in Scotland present themselves more particularly to the notice of the Society, and it is desired to make some observations upon them.The markets for home-grown timber have materially altered since the commencement of the war, and this Memorandum covers chiefly the experience of the Society since the end of 1914. During that period the Society have dealt with lots of timber on 300 estates.In the first place the Society desires to call attention to certain defects in the management of woodlands which they have found prevalent in Scotland : 1. An absence of any settled policy in the management of woods. 2. A failure to put in force any consistent working plan.3. An absence of any system of classification, which is essential where timber varies so much in qualityas it does in many of our woods. 4. A lack of organisation and uniformity in the methods of selling timber.&apos; ;..   5. A practice of advertising lots of timber for sale, without the lots having been valued, and without thecontents having been even approximately estimated. , ;.6.; An absence of records of annual production of timber, and, where records are kept of timber sold, there is often no record of the quantity or value of timbers used for estate purposes.These defects arise mainly from waut of sufficient knowledge on the part of owners, and want of proper training on the part of foresters. Scottish foresters have the reputation of being highly skilled in their profession, and in many cases this reputation is well deserved. There is, however, even among those who are highly skilled in the management of growing woods, a considerable want of knowledge of the best methods of marketing timber, and a want of training on commercial methods of dealing with invoices, sale notes, and other particulars of a similar character.It is suggested, therefore, that the first requisite for an improved system of forestry is the provision of suitable education for various classes of foresters.There is the young forester who has been brought up in the woods from his boyhood, but who has had n0 scientific training ; and there is the young forester who has begun his training in college or school, but who has had no practical experience. Both of them should be given an opportunity of supplying their deficiencies.There is the forester already in charge of woods, who understands his outdoor work, but who is ignorant of bookkeeping, and has had ho training in the preparation of records or reports. Facilities should be given to men of this class to obtain the knowledge they lack ; and they should be trained to recognise that the principal object of their operation must be to obtain the best commercial value from the woods under their charge.Provision should also bel,made for giving a scientific training in the higher branches of the profession to men, whether already foresters or&apos;not, who are capable of profiting by it. Men with such a training are sure to be in demand whenever forestry becomes a national industry, and it would be advisable to lose no time in preparing a sufficient number of such men for the work they will be required to do.At the present time, when foreign timber is so scarce and high in price, there is no difficulty in disposing of any home-grown wood. When imports are resumed, however, on a normal scale, old difficulties may again arise, such as the prejudice of many wood-consuming industries against home-grown timber. This prejudice is often based on the irregularity and uncertainty of the home supply, and there has been some ground for it in the past. But many consumers go further than this, and consider that home-^rown timber cannot equal the foreign in quality ; though it is a fact, known to many, that home-grown wood has
frequently been purchased as foreign, arid the difference never perceived. Many architects have adopted this prejudice, and builders are generally compelled by specifications to use only foreign wood. If the State would insist upon British timber being used in all Government buildings, this unfairness towards home-grown timber would gradually die away. .The difficulty of marketing &quot;home-grown timber owing to the uncertainty of supply referred to will be o-ot over by better business methods oh the part of those who have the management of woods.As is known, large tracts of timber have beeu felled in Scotland since the commencement of the war, and the felling still continues. In anticipation of the replanting which must take place, it is desirable to see that proper precautions are taken so that the new plantations may be started at the lowest cost and with the best chance of success.1. Brushwood should be burned up immediately after felling, and under no circumstances should it be allowed to remain after Aprils otherwise it will not only become a breeding ground for beetle, but will get covered with moss and rough vegetation, and the operations of the planters will be seriously hindered thereby. The Society regret to observe that, in spite of warning, brushwood has been allowed to remain and litter the ground on practically the whole of the felling areas which are being worked under Government control.2. All ground to be replanted should, if necessary, be drained at least six months before the planting is to take place, so as to take the sourness out of the ground.3. The danger of vermin of various kinds should be guarded against. SquiiTels have become a danger in many places. Being driven off the older woods by felling operations, they are making their homes in the younger plantations, which are not being cut. During the summer of a bad cone year these squirrels maybe terribly destructive unless effective measures are taken to combat the pest. It is surprising to see from reports made by the Society&apos;s staff the number of young plantations the Society has recommended to be felled owing to their having been damaged by squirrels in their younger stages.4. There has been a tendency ou many estates for planting operations to be more extensive than the forestry staffs could deal with properly. This always leads to loss owing to want of beating up, thinning, &amp;c. Care should be taken that the forestry staff should not be overplanted in this sense.5. The old rule which was followed on some estates of the gamekeeper receiving first consideration must be discontinued. The gamekeeper should not be allowed in future to interfere in any way with the sylvicultural management of plantations of any age.When areas are being replanted, there should be kept in view the requirements of the local markets, both as regards size and species of timber. Thus Scots fir is required in Aberdeenshire for box boarding, barrel headings, &amp;c. Pitwood might be grown in the districts nearest to the coalpits, or in those districts where the transport to the coalfields would not be excessive. It might be advisable to have short rotation crops for pitwood in those districts.The present prices received for pitwood are such as warrant the sale of small trees and the cutting of immature crops, which have been squirrel-damaged or are growing on wrong ground, but previous to the war practically no home-grown pit props were sold in Scotland. The reason for this was that there was not only a preference lor the foreign timber as being cleaner grown and better prepared than home pitAvood, but the cost of transporting the pitwood from foreign countries to home consumers was in many cases materially less than the cost of working and transporting the home timber from the plantations to the pits. Unless home prices are to be kept up to something near their present standard, it is probable that home pitAvood will be again ousted from the market. This might be remedied by cheaper railway rates for home pitAvood. Maximum rates have been fixed for the duration of the war, but some permanent arrangement will be necessary if the home grower is not to be unduly handicapped in competition with the foreign producer. Failing a suitable adjustment of railway rates, a moderate tariff on foreign pitwood might answer the purpose.The above remarks apply equally to railway sleepers. . It may be of interest to the Committee to know the prices which are at present being obtained for home timber standing and delivered. It would be no criterion to give the prices of hardwoods, as hardwoods vary so much in price according not only to size but to quality. The timber merchant has to take a greater risk AArith hardwoods than with conifers, and he often obiains tAvice as much for one hardwood tree growing next to another one of the same species if it is snitable for a special purpose. The quality of hardwoods cannot generally be ascertained until they are felled.In considering the prices set forth beloAv, it must be kept in view that they are average prices. For standing timber the prices vary considerably according to distance from railway station, nature of roads, nature of ground, proximity to markets and districts being worked by large merchants. For the purposes of comparison, the prices which are quoted for pitwood timber are given at so much per tree. The prices of the measurable timber are given at so much per cube standing, and in the manufactured or semi-manufactured state.   The work on pitwood is not anything like so much as on heavy sawn timber.The present prices of standing timber show a substantial advance on pre-Avar prices, but they are not such as to justify the prevalent belief, either that the prices are extravagant in themselves or that they are responsible for the increase in the price of coal which consumers have to pay. Since the war began, the price of the best coal has risen about 10s. per ton ; but of this increase, not more than Is. per ton is due to the cost of timber. And though there have been some cases in which exceptional prices have been offered and accepted for Avood, it may be stated with confidence that in feAv instances do present prices yield more than 5 per cent, reckoned at compound interest on the cost of planting and subsequent outgoings.Pitwood.

Tbey are inclined to think that there are sufficient stocks of pitwood to supply the mines for some time to come, but the supply of heavy timber is more doubtful. In both cases, however, the most urgent question is an adequate supply of labour.If any further labour can be made available, the Society considers that it could be most economically used if it were placed at the disposal of timber merchants, who have the requisite experience iu getting work done speedily and efficiently.The prospects of replanting and new planting are dealt with fully in the statement of the Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society. The Landowners&apos; Co-operative Forestry Society is of opinion that unless some direct encouragement, such as a bonus, is offered, few landowners will be able to afford to replant after the Avar.The present burden of rates and taxes on woodlands is so enormously heavy that some remission is essential if an active forestry policy is to be fostered among private owners.Memorandum on Methods by which Forestry can be Encouraged (particularly dealing with Organization and Railway Rates).

Many of these are the result of a generation of unfortunate neglect by the State and the country generally, as well as of the depressing experience of the past forty years. Sad experiences and unhappy memories of a whole generation cannot be remedied by some brilliant stroke of a pen.Short of impracticable schemes for controlling the import of timber into this country, there is no &quot;five-minute&quot; solution to this problem; particularly in view of the exceptional variety and range of conditions, customs and also conflicting interests prevailing in England and Wales, as somewhat distinct from Scotland.Real encouragement lies in a steady, persevering and sympathetic general policy.The writer attaches even greater importance to the spirit and manner in which any scheme is launched than to the enumeration of details which, with a new policy entailing the reconstruction of the entire industry, can be decided only after full discussion with the various interests. It is yet impossible to decide what will be the actual position and national requirements at the end of the war, and these must, of course, influence and guide mauy details.The encouragement of forestry presents exceptional difficulties in comparison with other industries, since it seems impracticable to encourage production by guaranteeing a minimum price for native timber, as with native wheat. The &quot; compound interest&quot; argument will be very difficult to combat in view of dear money after the war, and it is important to foresee and try to meet these difficulties.The object of this Memorandum, therefore, is to suggest the basis of a broad and generous policy by which alone forestry can be encouraged in this country.It is impossible to deal with the matter concisely, and many points mentioned may be thought obvious and unnecessary. Their importance, however, cannot be emphasized too strongly, and they are invariably overlooked or under-estimated, in particular by those who are imperfectly informed on the rural history of the past generation or have not been in close touch with the actual and varied conditions and depressing influences.
214General Methods by which Forestry can be Encouraged.The three most important factors of an enlightened forestry policy may he summed up in the three words :&quot; Confidence,&quot; &quot; Capital&quot; &quot; Co-operation:&apos;To encourage and ensure confidence in the industry of forestry in the direction of markets and also in the production of timber, all interested must be assured that the unfortunate experience of ruined markets; unremunerative prices and lack of demand for the native timber will never be repeated, and this &quot; pall &quot; must be removed from the industry.Forestry must not be regarded as an expensive hobby, but rather as a practical and flourishing industry.The production of timber should be put at once on a proper economic foundation, so that either the State or the individual planting trees can be assured at least of a fair return from the investment in a like manner to a farmer who plants wheat or potatoes or a coal-owner who exploits his mines.Land settlement and other subsidized schemes are proposed for re-peopling the land. No doubt any large scheme requires an initial outlay of capital and systematic encouragement. Unless such schemes, however, can be rendered as far as possible self-supporting under average commercial conditions, so as to attract capital and labour normally, they cannot be on a sound and successful basis. With a prosperous industry capital and labour flow into it in a natural way, since a proper return is assured and confidence is established. It is absurd to talk of forcing people to plant unless they are convinced at the same time of a proper return from their planting.The unanswerable reply given by the land-owner, when urged to plant under existing conditions, might be expressed thus : &quot; Why ask me to plant when I cannot sell remuneratively what timber I already &quot; possess. If I am satisfied that I can obtain a proper market and return from my timber, then I will put &quot; my woods in order and maintain them properly.&quot;In view of this depressing effect on planting, the organization of existing timber supplies is therefore of at least equal importance to the organization of future timber-production. Confidence in a proper return is important, not only from a private land-owner&apos;s standpoint, but also to ensure proper encouragement to forestry by the State.It is also important to secure as far as possible interest in forestry by the small owner, or even the tenant farmer. Indications point to a further cutting-up of estates in the near future, and small freeholders and others should be encouraged to produce not only timber on short rotations, but particularly coppice and poles for rural industries and also for agricultural and other purposes.The most effective obstruction to forestry proposals will emanate probably from the agricultural interests, including the small freeholder and tenant &quot;farmer. The latter will obtain considerable sympathy in protesting against being deprived of laud which they have occupied for a generation, even if only as a sheep run. If, however, they can be led to believe the industry to rest on a sound basis, and that planting should be encouraged &quot; because it will pay,&quot; this will greatly help to reconcile all objections. Since forestry in England must in many counties be a question mainly of small areas and scattered supplies, this point is doubly important. Forestry can then take its proper place beside agriculture, particularly in furnishing winter work for agricultural workers, and in establishing rural wood industries on the countryside.If Confidence is established, then Capital will automatically follow, and Co-operation will be largely a question of organization and of securing the hearty support of all.Confidence must be created.Economicsecurityessential.Industry self-supporting.Existing conditions discourage planting.Organization of existing sup-plies important.Small owners encouraged.Objections from agricul-tural intersts.Create Confi-dence first.Organization of Markets and Demand for Native Timber.- The writer hopes that the importance of this question is now appreciated, and that he need not repeat arguments which he has so often advanced. They are summarized in the objects and work of the Association of which he is Honorary Secretary, and which was created to deal with this the commercial  branch of the subject.The commercial utilization of native timber, with which he particularly deals, might be divided into two parts : (1) Organization of Supplies. The most important step in this direction is to ensure joint action by Joint action all owners of woodlands.   The supplies of native timber in this country including the large quantity of important, hedgerow, park and &quot; spinney &quot; timber are unevenly distributed, and the timber grown exceedingly varied ; the local markets have disappeared ; the proper and best markets are now at a considerable distance, therefore the organizing of supplies and the creating and encouraging of demand are of vital importance.It is necessary also to encourage and organize by every means possible local industries and local demands.Joint action is doubly necessary so as (o offer or command a sufficient quantity of timber iu a district at Collecting sup-one time and to ensure regular supplies.   Merchants and consumers can then be induced seriously to consider plies, offers of native timber, and an organized supply and demand created between producing and consuming centres, provided that the cost of transporting the timber is reasonable.Classification in the marketing of timber is important in supplying modern markets, and with joint Classifying action much might be done in this direction, although, even under the most favourable circumstances, timber, classification of the existing native supplies must necessarily be limited.(2) Organization of Markets. This includes all forms of advertising and business-promotion, for want Advertising of which nearly all our native timbers some of them the finest in the world are undervalued and neglected, native timber. The Board of Trade Returns make it clear that there are unlimited markets in this country for all the timber we can offer, wherever we can compete with the imported timber.   An important factor is to select the most lucrative and suitable outlet for each variety, class or quality of our native timber.   These selected markets should be encouraged to demand the native timber by being constantly reminded of its existence and superior qualities, and by the consumer insisting and the architect and inspector specifying that only Cultivating native timber should be used where it is suitable and available for a purpose.   It is, of course, necessary special mar-that organized supplies should be available to meet any demand created. kets&quot;The consumer or others who use or specify timber should receive even more attention than the Educating the merchant, who unfortunately only caters for a demand which others have created.   Much can be done in consumer.L 3
reinovirg false impressions about native timber, and in advising what timbers to select for any purpose and 8   Advising the     whence they may be obtained.   Producers must be informed of the best or most likely uses for which their producer.        timber may be grown or offered, as well as kept advised of market conditions, requirements and prices, and of local demands that should be cultivated.To allow these important factors the Organizations of Supplies aud Markets to be fully appreciated, a few illustrations, out of many which might be given, will be found in Appendix A, attached hereto.Cost of trans-port vital.Present rates prohibitive.Correct basi? of rates.&quot; Class A &quot; rates wanted.Pitwood pm-duction import-ant.Rates for pit-wood.Generous and broad policy necessary.Importance qf organization.Existing bodies consulted and encouraged.Railavay Rates.A vital point naturally in organizing supplies and markets of native timber is the cost of transporting the supplies to their proper and best markets. To reduce this cost is probably the first step to be taken to encourage forestry in England. Until existing railway rates are revised in favour of the native supplies so that the timber no matter where grown can find its proper markets at reasonable cost, the progress of forestry will be greatly retarded. The unevenly distributed nature of the supplies makes it impossible to transport innch of the timber converted into plank, although more might be done in this direction if joint action can be assured, a proper demand created and encouragement given by reasonable railway charges.It is not proposed here to discuss rates in detail, since it is common knowledge that they are not only oppressive but even in many cases prohibitive. Rough and crooked timber and exceptional trees can be excluded from the argument, since special arrangements might be made for these classes of timber. What is needed Avith reference to English timber generally is to have only such rates as the timber will reasonably bear, having regard to the price obtained at the consuming centre, which is invariably fixed by thep rice of the imported^ timber.Pitwood in Hampshire should be able to reach its best market in South Wales or the Midlands ; Beech in Devonshire should be able to reach its proper market at High Wycombe, Birmingham, &amp;c.; Oak suitable for the building and other trades, should be able to reach its best market in London or other centres ;Ash in the Severn Valley should be able to reach its market in Londou or elseAvhere.In short, wherever the native supplies are grown, they should be able to reach the best or selectedmarkets in this country, na matter at what distance.This would probably entail a &quot; Class A &quot; rate, possibly adding a charge for the use of the trucks or wagons when these Avere the property of the railway company,The question of raihvay rates is a-ital to the production of timber on short rotations in the future for pitwood or pulpwood. This form of timber production undoubtedly will be of the greatest national importance, aud special inducements should be given to individuals to plant suitable land.Much of the best aud cheapest land for afforestation is naturally at a great distance from the industrial centres. Such land may be found on the Welsh hills, the Cornish and Devonshire moors, and includes also the sandy and poor soils of Hampshire, Norfolk, and other counties.Pitwood grown in Devon or CornAvall should be able to reach the Midland or any other colliery centre in England at a rate not exceeding 10s. per ton. For shorter distances the timber rate might be the same as the coal rate between the same two centres. This Avould be a comparatively simple arrangement, there being a coal rate for nearly every station in England. Since the timber is raw material for the mines, it is surely reasonable to give it the same transport facilities as the more valuable coal, for whose production it is indispensable.The question of Railway Rates is dealt Avith in more detail, and with suggestions for their revision, in Appeudix B, attached hereto.Organization of Timber Production.mOrganization in this direction must be taken in its broadest seuse, involving the co-ordination of machinery for the reconstruction of English forestry on broad and generous lines. As much interest and help as possible should be assured from every quarter, and all available knoAvledge utilized to the fullest extent.It will be also necessary to educate and give every guidance and facility to Avilling planters. The organization of forestry must be dovetailed in Avith its sister industry, agriculture, aud generally should be associated Avith rural development and reclamation. Moreover, it will be necessary to organize production of supplies of timber for : (a) National Industries ;(b) Special Markets ;(c) Local Wood Industries.Organization is important in every direction of forestry, and is absolutely essential Avhen starting a comparatively new industry Avhich may conflict with old-fashioned ideas or adverse interests.Full advantage must be taken of branches of local organizations connected with existing bodies and who not only monopolize expert knowledge of local conditions, but also possess special facilities&apos; and influence for securing local support. It is of the utmost importance that all bodies interested in forestry should be consulted and encouraged in every Avay, and that all efforts should be co-ordinated and a spirit of mutual sympathy and confidence ensured. Every advantage should be taken of the fact that industries like forestry and agriculture are fortunate in the manner in which they secure voluntary aid, and for the number of willing workers who enthusiastically come forward to help.In view of the number and diverse character of the areas to be planted and the numerous branches of forestry to be encouraged, it is particularly important to organize the production of timber properly with a vieAV to decreased cost of production and increased returns from forestry.It is obviously impossible to go into details of the organization of forestry. The important point is the general policy, and, again, the spirit and manner in which a scheme is inaugurated. Unless a generous attitude is adopted and the support obtained of the most enlightened and experienced representatives of the forestry world, any scheme will be seriously handicapped and the future of forestry retarded.
215Encouragement to Land-Owners for Planting.What further encouragement will be necessary to land-owners for planting apart jrom loans will Advantages depend entirely on how far the suggested general methods are adopted of encouraging forestry on generous oi Estate lines.   In view of the advantages enjoyed by private estates for planting small areas as compared with Foresfcr7-large-scale State afforestation, this question should receive very careful and sympathetic attention.One great advantage to the country of giving land-owners every encouragement and inducement to plant is that it is the cheapest manner of carrying out afforestation and creating supplies of timber. The matter, is admittedly urgent, and private planting should be encouraged by every means, so as to supplement State proposals.The following advantages, amongst others, enjoyed by private enterprise, emphasize   rhe   ireat importance of English estate forestry : (1) Small areas, spinneys aud hedgerows can be planted, whereas in many districts it will be difficult tofind areas large enough for State afforestation ; (2) Planting will be done close to towns, villages and industrial centres where housing and otherfacilities are available ; t(3) Better soils suitable for Ash and other important trees will be planted, whereas the large proportionof land in State afforestation will be suitable for coniferous timber only ; (4) Planting can be combined to a far greater extent with agriculture and rural wood industries andthe general development of the countryside.If all parties of the State would announce their intention to give every facility and inducement to plants Assurance of and an assurance that owners who did their duty would receive every protection and also special treatment security, in the future, this would give much encouragement to land-owners for planting.Private enterprise should be given reasonable time to do work voluntarily before the State intervened, particularly in the direction of timber for short rotations.The most effective encouragement that can be given would include : (1) Confidence in the future of General encour-the industry ; (2) Stability of capital; (3) Reasonable Imperial and local charges ; (4) Immunity from agement. risks and losses.The importance has already been emphasized of ensuring increased prices for the timber on the one hand and diminished cost of production and transport on the other.. . ,   . Special Forms of Encouragement.Alternative schemes should be offered, leaving the owner free to adopt either of these alternatives. The independence of the British character should be respected and private enterprise should be encouraged and not forced.Loans should be offered at nominal interest rate, and as long as a loan is outstanding the woods would be subject to Government supervision. The owner should have the option of paying off the loan at any time and the woods would then be free from supervision.Woodlands should receive special treatment as regards Imperial and local charges, since the long deferred nature of the investment differentiates it from other classes of property. All expenditure on woods managed on commercial lines and planting should be allowed as a deduction from the income tax payable on the owner&apos;s private income.   Woods and timber should be entirely exempt from death duty.A bonus for planting would be a welcome and useful stimulus, but the exact nature of the bonus or the basis on which it should be fixed must be left for discussion.It might reasonably be submitted that, since the timber is required for wealthy industrial undertakings such as collieries, a bonus should be given by the consumer, but the exact form of this bonus might be difficult to determine beyond guaranteeing a demand for the timber at remunerative prices.Replanting of Woodlands Felled during the War.Where large areas of timber have been felled during the war, and possibly increased prices obtained, it Area doubtful, might be argued that the replanting should be made compulsory.   It is impossible to decide until after the war what has been the total area felled under war pressure.   In England, at least, the area will probably be small as compared with the total area of woodlands, or especially, the total area required for afforestation.There are considerable difficulties first to consider such as the following :  Difficulties.(1) Hoto to define clear-felling. In some cases worthless trees and scrub might be left and the extentof the clearance will be difficult to define.   It would be putting a premium on bad forestry ifthese areas were not included for compulsory replanting. (2) Thinning only would have taken place in many cases, whereas clear-felling would have beensounder forestry.   In any case badly-grown and inferior trees have formed a large proportion ofthe timber realized. -(3) Sale of the area would be easy and so evade the liability, and again, a timber merchant or agentof doubtful standing might have purchased the woodlands. (4) The areas would be too small for afforestation by the State in the event of failure by privateenterprise.Any element of compulsion might wreck the whole scheme of afforestation and make the subject Objections, unpopular, on account especially of the following objections : (1) It would penalize the patriotic owner who planted timber for a national crisis without any encouragement by the State.  The investment in many cases would not have been remunerative. (2) It would penalize the patriotic owner who offered his timber when it was required in the national/crisis.,  :     _     : -        &apos; r- ; -    . \;.&apos;v. .. .&apos;      :     .  ;;\ -      &quot;   :(3) The price realized in some cases would be no higher than before the war, particularly with Oak, and in other cases the higher prices would have been for selected timber only.   In many cases it &quot; would be difficult to say whether higher prices had been obtained or not, since different trees or .1...... part;S 0f a tree are classified at different prices.L 4
(4) One class only of investment or ownership should not he penalized.(5) Some who had possibly made the most profit might escape, and in other cases compulsion might bear hardly on a man who had lost heavily in other directions. In a residue of cases the ground might be put to a better use, or be unsuitable for replanting.(6) It would fall much more heavily on owners of woodlands close to railways or in spots easily accessible, since woodlands with heavy transport cost have been comparatively free from felling.(7) Compulsion would exclude all pre-war cuttings brought about by the breaking-up of estates, and it is many of these areas which most need replanting. It would fall heavily on owners of coniferous woods, whereas owners of poor and badly-stocked areas of hardwoods and coppice would escape.The persons (if any) who should be penalized are those who did not plant previous to the war and create timber reserves for a national crisis.A policy involving compulsion would certainly clash with the policy advocated in other parts of this memorandum. It might be submitted that, instead of these owners being handicapped, they should receive a Ijoiius from their country for having created a reserve of timber for a time of emergency.Encouragement of Forestry by the State.It has been impossible to suggest in this memorandum the extent to which the encouragement of forestry should be left to voluntary aid and to existing bodies, or how far, and in what directions, the State can render valuable aid.Apart from State afforestation, the State can obviously do much to encourage forestry by private enterprise. Haviug regard to all the conditions riding in this country, to the unfortunate lack of encourage-ment from the State in the past, and particularly to the independence and sensitiveness of the British character, it would be wiser that encouragement in many directions should be principally of a general character.The powerful influence which the State can assert would be very valuable in many of the directions indicated, aud in assisting to solve some of the problems and particular^ to remove existing handicaps.Invaluable help could be given to native supplies in competing with the imported timber, particularly by publishing complete information as to foreign supplies of timber and imported wood manufactures.Encouragement of education and research and the distribution of knowledge will always be one of the most important and effective steps to encourage any industry.It is seldom fully appreciated what a deplorable influence the losses which have been experienced in planting in the past have had on the whole subject of forestry. No more effective steps could be taken for encouraging confidence iu planting than resolute State measures to deal with and do everything possible to prevent risk of loss from (1) Insects ; (2) Fire ; (3) Fungi ; (4) Gales ; (5) Frost; (6) Drought, &amp;c. There is an enormous field open for research and distribution of knowledge in these directions.Such questions as claims for extraordinary traffic to the roads in removing timber from woods on which highway rates have been paid during the whole rotation should also be dealt with effectively in the interests of forestrv.The State could do much to counteract adverse influences, and particularly silence unfortunate agitations and speeches which do so much to discourage planting by private enterprise.In all future legislation forestry should be carefully nursed and protected, aud members of both Houses of Parliament should be fully and correctly informed on all subjects affecting forestry and rural development.Conclusion.After many years of depression, apathy and neglect, there is now a great opportunity to establish forestry on sound lines and to ensure that it should at last receive the attention it deserves.When bringing out proposals very full consideration is necessary, so that they may be such as to meet with a favourable reception and not prejudice the Avhole future of forestry.Something more substantial than optimistic estimates of returns from planting is required to create confidence in the industry after the sad experiences of the past.Those who remember the glut of foreign timber of fine quality at prices ruinous to the home producer, and the days when even the best qualities of native Oak and other timbers were practically unsaleable, and when thousands of acres of coppice previously valuable could be had for the cutting, will want an assurance that such experiences will not be repeated.The defence of the realm now demands generous State aid to enable forestry to be taken up on an extensive scale, and generous encouragement to private enterprise, while sufficiently protecting the interests of the State.APPENDIX  A.The Importance of the Organization of Native Timber.Pitwood. The production of pitwood in this country is important to the defence of the realm, not only in time of war but also as an assurance against transport strikes, &amp;c. Foreign pitwood enjoys peculiar advantages of water-transport and organized production and marketing, and it will be necessary to give the native supplies special encouragement, particularly in reduced cost of transport.English Oak. Our native Oak is unequalled for several special purposes, and supplies of this timber are. abundant in the country.   Consumers such as builders, railway companies, &amp;c, who require annually
APPENDIX B.Railavay Rates on Native Timber.The charges imposed by British raihvays for the conveyance of the native timber have been a long-standing grievance to producers and also to the timber trade, but the cost naturally falls on the forme class.Agitations have been raised from time to time, and meetings and conferences have discussed the problem,, but all to little effect.The matter has become more urgent from year to year, and the grievance has increased, mainly OAving to the fact that Avhen these rates were imposed there was a far larger proportion of native timber consumed locally by wheelwrights and other small consumers. Year by year, however, a larger proportion of the native supplies has to find a market at a distance and in the large industrial centres, and these are undoubtedly where the proper markets for the timber are now to be found.Any number of rates can be quoted and any number of comparisons made Avith other classes of produce, but tAvo main points will be readily admitted by all who have gone into the question : (1) That the rates are far too high and in cases prohibitive.(2) That these high rates have a very detrimental effect not only on the markets but also on the production of timber.The question therefore arises Iioav this position can be remedied, but the problem is naturally difficult and involved.The rates Avere fixed by Act of Parliament, and it is impossible to compel the railways to charge less than they are authorized to do by this Act. The reply of the raihA&apos;ays naturally is that &quot; Parliament has ;&apos; fixed these rates,&quot; and they say they Avill not loAver the rates because lower rates would be unremuneratiAre. For the purpose of this memorandum it is unnecessary to discuss what might be a remunerative or an unremunerative rate.It is probably impossible even for a railway authority to prove that lower rate&apos;s Avould not be remunerate, since it is impracticable to take one item by itself and say Avhat is the exact remunerative rate for it. Producers contend that if loAver rates might not be remunerative it is because only a small amount of traffic iioav passes on account of the high rates, and the railways reply that lower rates Avould not pay them.To appreciate the position it is necessary to refer to the history of the subject. These rates Avere fixed by the 1892 Act, after a very long and careful analysis by Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Commission. This inquiry sat for two years investigating the Avhole question of rates, and as a result brought fonvard the Bill Avbich then became JaAV aud which amended the 1888 Act. Maximum rates were fixed, and, as might be expected, the large industrial concerns, such as coal, iron and other industries, having special facilities and unlimited funds for putting forward their case, naturally secured the best terms. Traffic from the rural districts, for Avant of organization and other handicaps, was correspondingly penalized.The rates being classified and maximum rates fixed, any alteration must therefore be downAvards, and this possibly is the Avhole secret of the question.The railways may not be satisfied Avith the Act and really Avould like to see it at least amended, if not repealed. Several classes of traffic possibly may be noAV carried at unremunerative rates OAving to changes during the past 25 years. Since a rate cannot be raised that now may be unremunerative, other rates have to suffer. The first remedy Avould be, therefore, to amend the Act of Parliament, which could probably only be done after much consideration and discussion.A step in the right direction, at least, might be an endeavour to assist the railways to make the rates more remunerative, especially by a better organization of supplies and demand. If special rates Avere offered between producing and consuming centres, serious attempts might then be made to organize special markets between the tAvo centres and a regular supply of timber.Special inducements to load timber to the best advantage might be given, and to secure larger loads on the individual trucks.If the rate on timber were further classified, this would undoubtedly help in some directions.   A really good freight, such as pitwood in short lengths, should receive special treatment.   Straight and clean U  4656 Mlarge quantities of Oak and other timber, naturally give little consideration to disorganized, unadvertised and uncertain supplies. Supplies could be classified and selected to a far greater extent to cater for particular trades, given business methods and reasonable railway rates. At the present time, owing to the unfortunate absence of organization, the consumer declines to entertain the native timber, the merchant refuses to stock it, and the land-owner from lack of demand finds it comparatively unsaleable.Joint action and organization should do much to remove so depressing an influence on English forestry.Elm. A native timber, possessing most valuable properties, but which is invariably put to inferior uses, is the common Elm, of which large supplies exist in all the hedgerows in this country. For Avant of organization and proper advertising, this timber is usually sold, with great difficulty, at a fraction of its proper value. If this timber grew in America, the Avorld Avould be taught to look up to it as a rare and handsome wood and of great value for uses where very hard Avear is encountered.Poplar. This probably is our finest tree for hedgerows, spinneys, stiff soils, boggy places, aud for planting over Alder or other coppice. For this timber there should be unlimited demand at remunerative prices for many special purposes. Owing to the low price obtained for small and odd lots of timber when offered, it has received far too little attention from planters. Owing also to the supplies being so Avidely scattered, only a few trees usually are offered on any one estate. The parcel is too small to be entertained by merchants at a distance, so that a proper supply and demand cannot be cultivated, while existing raihvay charges take far too large a proportion of the price obtained. By joint action in marketing sufficient supplies could be offered in one district to induce the merchant and consumer to consider the timber seriously, and a proper demand could be cultivated.
Larch-trees and other conifers, of AvhicbTlarge loads can be put on individual trucks, should also receive better treatment than rough and irregularly-shaped trees.Timber should not have to pay increased rates when it travels over more than one line.The most hopeful solution of the problem might be to represent strongly to the railways the extremely detrimental effect on the development of the country and the rural districts caused by the.prohibitive rates. The present position must not continue, and they should be told that, unless it is remedied, compulsory steps to secure proper treatment for rural produce will be taken by Parliament. The proper development of the country districts and of so important an industry as forestry, with its dependent rural wood industries, must be secured at all costs.Forestry cannot reach the satisfactory position all would like to see, and planting cannot be started by estates on a large scale, unless landowners are assured first that the timber which they are asked to grow will reach its proper markets and bring in a proper return.Failing a solution of the problem by ordinary means and by satisfactory arrangements with the railways, an alternative might be the creation of a tribunal which would inquire into the rates and say what was or what was not a reasonable rate for timber or other produce.It is possible that if these alternatives were placed before the railways and a really good case made 6ut; for the alteration of the rates, the principals of the railways would consider the question seriously and take the matter out of the hands of their rates department, which naturally tries to place every obstacle in the way of any alteration.Whatever is decided, something must be done in this important question, which in the past has had so detrimental an effect on forestry and rural development.APPENDIX 2.Forestry and the Development Commission.0General Principles of the Action.of the Development CommissionersIn their first Annual Report the Commissioners explained that on the subject of forestry development they had formulated for their guidance in considering British schemes and applications, the following principles : (a) That the first requirement for such development is effective education in forestry at suitable centres, regulated by organised research and demonstration.(li) That no scheme of State afforestation on a large scale can be considered until investigation has shown where State forests might be economically and remuneratively provided (regard being had to the interests of other rural industries), and until a trained body of foresters has become available.(c) That for the present applications for grants for the above purposes should include provision for the creation and maintenance of such staff as may be necessary to give practical advice and assistance to those who desire to undertake afforestation or to develop existing afforested areas.The action taken by the Commissioners falls into two main divisions ; (i) the creation or improvement of facilities for education, research and the obtaining of technical advice ; (ii) afforestation by the State itself or the grant of State assistance in money to bodies or persons in possession of land which they desire to afforest.(i) Education, Research and Technical Advice.Grants are made from the Development Fund to encourage and develop forestry research, education, and the provision of technical advice.England and Wales. England and Wales have been divided into five districts, the centre of each being a University or Agricultural College. Two of these centres (Oxford and Cambridge Universities) were to be equipped for higher education in forestry, and the other three (University College of North Wales, Bangor ; Armstrong College, Newcastle-on-Tyne; Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester) for forestry education of a less advanced kind. Before the war an annual graut was made of 2,5007. to provide for the salaries and travelling expenses of five Advisory Officers, one at each of the centres ; 500/. to Oxford and 500/. to Cambridge for the salary and expenses of a research officer ; 200/. to the other centres for research ; 1,000/. for minor forestry experiments mainly conducted by means of sample plots, vested in and under the control of the five institutions which are the centres of educational and advisory work ; and a sum for the salaries and expenses of the forestry staff of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. The staff included officers for the survey of afforestable areas, and progress was being made when the Avar broke out and interrupted the work.Grants amounting to 1*4,500/. have been made to equip the Forest of Dean and adjoining Avoodlands as a Forestry Demonstration! Area. No outlay Avas involved for acquiring the Avoods as they were already CroAvn property. The grants included provision for a forestry school, a forest garden, a Avoodmen&apos;s school, and for museum, library and laboratory. Sums are provided annually for maintenance. A grant of 2,5001. was made to Cambridge University in aid of the cost of erection and equipment of the eastern portion of the School of Forestry ; 1,060/. to Oxford University in aid of the cost of a research laboratory at the School of Forestry, and 285/. to Armstrong College (Newcastle-on-Tyne) in aid of the provision of a newr building in ChopAvell Woods to serve for purposes of forestry museum and of forestry instruction.... Scotland. In Scotland an annual grant of 1,500/. is normally made to meet the salaries and expenses of three forestry officers for advisory, survey and research work, one at each of the three Scotch Agricul-tural Colleges. In order to develop a centre for higher forestry education in Scotland, grants have been made available to Edinburgh University of 2,000/. for the establishment and maintenance for five years of a forest garden, 4,500/. to meet one-half of the cost of new buildings, museum and laboratories, 2,000/. for* Memorandum received from the Development Commission.
217equipment during the first five years, and 2,5001. to meet for five years the salary of an assistant lecturer, with demonstrators. Jn support of less advanced teaching and the technical instruction of working foresters, a grant was made to Aberdeen University of 550/. for the adaptation of premises at the University and 200/. towards the equipment of the building. An advance to the Aberdeen and North of Scotland College of Agriculture has been sanctioned to meet one-half of the cost of the purchase and equipment of Craibstoue Estate, acquired for the general purposes of the College. The estate included, however, 218 acres of woodlands as well as a suitable site for a forest garden. The advance of 750/. recommended by the Develop-ment Commissioners in aid of the establishment, and maintenance (for five years) of a forest garden at Craibstone has not yet been sanctioned by the Treasury owing to the financial stringency.In their second report the Commissioners stated that the main outstanding requirement of Scotch forestry education was a demonstration area, and they have always taken the view that the area should be in a central and accessible position in Scotland.Early in 1914 the Board of Agriculture submitted a proposal for the purchase of an estate in Aberdeen-shire on the representation that a suitable central area could not be obtained. The Commissioners carefully considered the proposal, but could not regard the locality as suitable for a National Demonstration Forest in view of the educational requirements to be fulfilled. Later in the year the Commissioners framed an alternative scheme, with a view to its adoption by the Board, for acquiring about 4,000 acres (including 1,000 acres of woodlands) near Dunkeld, which all parties agreed was the ideal centre, on lease for 150 years (with provision for further extension) on terms based on the existing rental value of the land. The pro-prietors had also agreed to make available for demonstration purposes, free of any payment, 5,000 acres of adjacent woodlands for 40 years, during which period they undertook that this further area should be managed under the prescription of a working plan prepared by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland. The Commissioners were willing to set aside a total sum of 150,000?. to finance the scheme if it were adopted by the Board. The scheme was not, however, accepted by the Board and the whole question is therefore at present in abeyance.Ireland. Advances are made annually to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland to meet the salaries and travelling expenses of additional staff to assist generally in their forestry work and particularly in the afforestation of areas acquired by means of advances from the Development Fund. A small grant of 1,385/. spread over five years was provided to assist the Kildare County Council in the maintenance of small woodlands on condition that they were made available for purposes of education and research, and that properly trained woodmen were employed and home nurseries established.(ii) Afforestation.The amount of the Development Fund has not permitted the Commissioners to contemplate afforestation upon any large scale unless it was possible to draw also upon other funds.   They proposed, therefore, so far as Great Britain was concerned, generally to restrict themselves, for a time at any rate, to two lines of action: -(1) The advance of loans to local authorities already possessing suitable laud, thereby avoiding thefinancial strain of purchasing or leasing all land afforested. (2) The purchase and planting of experimental areas of about 5,000 acres each iu perhaps six differeut districts in England aud Wales, one main object being to encourage private landowners to take up timber cultivation.(a) Afforestation by Local Authorities. In 1912 the Commissioners prepared a statement for the guidance of local authorities who might wish to apply for State aid in carrying out schemes of afforestation on water-catchment areas or other suitable areas under their control. This statement, together with the conditions which the Commissioners think ought to accompany any advance to a local authority for the afforestation of water catchment areas, will be found in the Commissioners&apos; Third Annual Report, pages 23-25. An agreemeut has already been made with the Corporation of Liverpool for the afforestation of 5,000 acres of their water-catchment area at Lake Vyrnwy, upon the basis tha au advance of 51. per acre for the initial expenses of planting is made from the Development Fund to the Corporation, and in return the Fund will receive one-half of the proceeds of the ultimate timber yield. In November 1915 the Commissioners recommended a loan of 7,962/. at 3 per cent, compound interest for the afforestation of 1,327 acres of the water-catchment area of the Lanark Middle Ward District Committee ; but, owing to the war, the Treasury have up to the present sanctioned a loan at 5 per cent, of 600/. only for certain purposes, the whole scheme to be considered after the war. Negotiations have been carried on with other local authorities, but schemes have been posponed until the war is over.(b) Afforestation by the State [[Ireland). It has already been explained that the general policy of the Commissioners has been to concentrate on effective education at suitable centres regulated by organised research and demonstration as the first requirement for forestry development. They considered, however, that State afforestation on a small scale might be started in Ireland immediately, and the special Irish circumstances which justified this departure from the general policy were set out in the Commissioners&apos; First Report (p. 26).The past history aud present circumstances connected with the ownership of laud in Ireland differ so widely from those in other parts of the United Kingdom that the Commissioners thought it useless to consider other means of acquiring reasonably large areas than purchase outright.Loans of 25,000/. to the Department of Agriculture were sanctioned several years ago for the purchase of afforestable land, but additioual loans of 21,750/. recommeuded by the Commissioners in September 1914 have not yet been sanctioned by the Treasury in view of the financial stringency. Forestry operations have been concentrated on the three centres of Ballyhoura, Co. Cork; Slieve Bloom, Queen&apos;s County; and Aughrim-Glendalough, Co. Wicklow. Working plans for these areas were prepared and approved, and instalments have been made annually on account of the following total sums estimated to be required for the period of the rotation in each case :  Ballyhoura area - 31,430Slieve Bloom area        - - - - . . - -   26,605Aughrim-Glendalough area       - - - - ... .   22,876Annual advances are made to the Department to meet the salaries and expenses of the forestry staff, whose appointment was made in connection with afforestation work financed from the Development Fund.
(c) Afforestation of Land leased by the State. It has already been stated that it was originally proposed to acquire land for the creation of about six additional forests (of some 5,000 acres each) in England and Wales for experimental purposes ; but since the war the Commissioners have decided that they will not recommend, except in special cases, advances for the purchase of new areas until a fuller utilisation has been secured of woodlands and afforestable land already in the possession of the State. The advantages and disavantages of the leasing of laud by the State have been set out in the Commissioners&apos; memorandum to the Reconstruction Committee. If the legal and other difficulties referred to in that memorandum are removed, the Commissioners are prepared to recommend advances to the Government Department concerned for approved schemes framed on the basis of the leasing of land in private ownership at an annual rent based upon the existing rentals, as an alternative to the proceeds-sharing proposals mentioned below.In 1914 the Commissioners made proposals for the afforestation of privately-owned land in Scotland, on the basis that the State and the owner share the ultimate proceeds. Under this scheme, which the Commissioners propose should be applicable also to England, Wales and Ireland, the land would be leased to a Government Department for an agreed term of years on the principle that nothing is paid for the use of the land until the proceeds of the forest begin to accrue. As they are realised they are divided between the Department and the owner according to the proportion which the rental value of the land bears to the sum provided from public funds for afforestation and maintenance. The leasing proposals would form an alternative to the proceeds-sharing scheme. An advance of 1,000/. to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland was recommended for expenditure during the year 1916-17 in connection with preliminary arrangements for leasing or other proposals for the afforestation of privately-owned land in Scotland, but it is not expected that much of. this sum will be spent. No proceeds-sharing scheme has yet been submitted to the Commissioners, and the leasing proposals are under the consideration of the three Government Departments of Agriculture.(d) Nursery Stock for emergency Afforestation Operations. Since the war the Commissioners have recommended a grant of 1,100/. to the Commissioners of Woods, and a grant of 1,270/. to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for the provision of nursery stock in anticipation of emergency afforestation operations at the close of the war.   Further grants for this purpose are contemplatedAPPENDIX 3.Note on the Landes of Gascony.The Landes are a classical example of successful afforestation work, and the resulting forests are of particular significance just now, since they are supplying the bulk of the pitwood used in the South Wales coal mines.      ,The Landes form a narrow strip of a total area of about 2,000,000 acres fringing the Bay of Biscay from Bordeaux to Spain. In the 18th century the Landes were a &quot;no-man&apos;s&quot; land. The moving sand dunes fringing the ocean where rapidly drifting over the interior plain, Avhich itself was a malarial swamp traversable by the few inhabitants only by means of stilts.Proposals for reclamation were first mooted about 1778, and the first State expenditure was in 1786 (50,000 livres), spent chiefly on drainage.Progress in expenditure is shown below :  Early 19th century -      -      -      ....      .      .      -,:     -    2,000 per annum.1808    - - .   - -     -     -     -     -     -    3,000 ,,     ,,1817    ----     - .     .      .      .     .    3,600 ,,1830 (about)-      -&quot;     -     - -     -     -     -      -      -      -   12,0001854    -&apos;     -      -      ------     -      -      -      -      -      -      -      --  16,000 ,,By about 1865 the total expenditure had amounted to 520,000/. (including 135,000/. on non-forestal work, e.g., roads, buildings and the construction of &quot; littoral dunes &quot;). The area afforested amounted to about 200,000 acres.    .By about 1850 the success of the work was assured, and by the law of 1857 the Local Authorities were permitted to dispose of part of communal lands to raise money for drainage and general improvement, purposes, while the State was empowered to create an extensive network of roads to serve the land so drained, and to place at the free disposal of the Local Authorities the services of competent engineers.The work of draining was finished in 1865, at a total cost of 36,000/. In one Department alone. (Gironde) 1,300 miles of drains were cut. To raise funds for this, and subsequent works, 162 Local Authorities alienated some 475,000 acres of laud. Between 18o/ and 1860 the State spent 256,000/. on the construction of some 22 roads (routes agricoles).The drained land was rapidly planted or sown with maritime pines. Of some 250,000 acres remaining to the Local Authorities, 185,000 were afforested by 1891, and the remainder was practically finished by 1905. Meanwhile private proprietors had afforested, at their own expense, practically the whole of their lands.The position, according to the decennial statistics of 1892, was as follows : Acres.

M. Huffel, writing in 1904, stated that the value at that time of the-Landes forests was, certainly over 20,000,000/., and contrasts the figure with the estimate of ^Eternal Sterility&quot; made little more than a century before. -The example of the Landes is interesting generally from the part played by the State. Originally the State was owner of all the littoral or moving dunes and an uncertain amount of the hinterlaud. The fixation of the littoral dunes, in itself quite unproductive, and a part of the drainage was undertaken by the State. Then followed drainage on a large scale by the Local Authorities, and subsequently the creation of a network of roads at State expense. The net result has been the creation of about 1^ millions of acres of forest by private owners, - th million acres by Local Authorities, and over ^-th million acres by the State ; the total area in fact corresponding very nearly with that which this Committee is recommending for the whole of the United Kingdom.In 1900 nearly 140 miles of littoral dunes were maintained by the State at an average cost of slightly more than 251. per mile per annum. ,Supplies of Pitwood from the Landes. In 1915 the Landes supplied just short of 1,000,000 loads to the United Kingdom, almost all going to South Wales. Since the war these forests have tided the South Wales mines over criticalperiods ; supplying from September 1914 to September 1915, for example, no less than 895,000 loads.It is worth noting, moreover, that the maritime pine of- the Laudes provides a timber of somewhat inferior quality, and that an amount equal to that imported during the war, but of better class, might verv well have been produced from the waste lands of South Wales itself, and the South of England generally.APPENDIX 4.Note on Afforestation by Local Authorities.Complete figures are not available of the total area of land held by Local Authorities in the catchment areas of their water supplies. An enquiry carried out by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1904 through the Local Government Boards for England and Scotland elicited the fact that there were upwards of 100,000 acres held for this purpose by 48 Local Authorities in England, Wales, and Scotland. Details were published in the Board&apos;s Journal for November of that year, from which the following approximate figures have been extracted :  0				Areas.		Country.	No. of						Authorities.

The Liverpool Corporation^ catchment area at Rivington, comprising some 10,000 acres, was omitted from the list, as were also the Glasgow Corporation^ catchment areas at Loch Katrine (23,200 acres) and the Gorbals Waterworks (2,600 acres). The Glasgow Corporation did not at that time own any of the land in its catchment areas except the sites of the reservoirs themselves and accessories to the waterworks, but, as was pointed out in the report, they had acquired the feuing rights over the whole of the Loch Katrine catchment area.The inclusion of the Rivington and Loch Katrine areas would make the total acreage approximately 134,000 acres.At the time of the enquiry little or nothing had been done by Local Authorities in the matter of afforestation, and the opportunity was taken.of drawing their attention to the recommendation of the Departmental Committee on British Forestry (1902) upon this subject.The enquiry was repeated in 1909 and showed that little progress in afforestation had been made. Reports received from fourteen Local Authorities indicated that altogether some 2,200 acres had been planted and that schemes were on foot for planting a similar area during the ensuing five years. It was evident, however, that with the exception of three or four of the larger municipalities the matter had been half-heartedly taken np. The cost of the work had also been very high in most cases aud there were indications that with one or two exceptions it had been indifferently carried out. Some of the planting had been hastily undertaken with a view to finding employment for men thrown out of work during the trade depression of the years 1908 and 1909, and generally without proper advice or expert supervision.Since 1909, a little further progress has been made. Liverpool Corporation has entered into a proceeds-sharing scheme which will result in the afforestation of 4,000.to 5,000 acres of the Vyrnwy area within the next 25 years. The Corporation of Glasgow has planted a small area on the Ardgoil Estate (14,740 acres), presented to it by Mr. A. Cameron Corbett, M.P. The Corporations of Leeds, Manchester, and Torquay have proceeded steadily with planting operations on a small scale.&quot; It will be&apos;observed that the total area in the occupation of Local Authorities is considerable. It is moreover increasing steadily ; for instance, the Corporation of Glasgow has recently extended its catchment areas, the total extent of the different areas (Loch Katrine, Loch Arklet, Glenfinlas, Loch Vennacher, and Gorbals) being now no less than 54,500 acres.   It is not &quot;possible to say definitely in the absence of a survey&apos;M 3
APPENDIX 5.Forestry Surveys.1. While afforestation has been strongly advocated in certain quarters during the iast century or so, there has been a failure to secure progress owing to no definite workable scheme having been adopted. With a view to formulating such schemes, surveys have already been proceeding in various parts of the United Kingdom during the last five or six years, and we understand that the Sub-Committee on Forestry desires to be advised as to the best methods of extending and standardizing them.We beg therefore to report as follows : 2. Definition. We define a forestry survey as an inquiry designed to afford as complete data as possible regarding the silvicultural value of our waste lands, and the economic condition of our woodlands. We have no hesitation in asserting that it is essential to extend and complete such inquiries without delay, because, until the information which they will afford has been collected, any large scheme of afforestation must remain tentative in character.The total area of uncultivated land in the United Kingdom has been returned at, roughly, 20,000,000 acres, and although various estimates have been made as to the proportion which could be planted with advantage, they must be regarded as purely conjectural, since they were based in no instance on adequate field work. It is a matter of common knowledge among foresters that a very large proportion of the 20,000,000 acres is not worth surveying, owing to elevation, exposure and unfavourable surface conditions, but the selection of 1,000,000 acres of plantable land distributed through the United Kingdom should not be a difficult matter, and would provide adequate data for the inauguration of a national scheme of afforestation.3. Classification. Surveys may be classified broadly into : (a) Preliminary surveys.(b) Special or detailed surveys.The former deal with the area and location of plantable land, and in themselves will enable a com-prehensive view to be taken of the whole afforestation problem as affecting the districts dealt with. The latter prepare the way for actual planting operations, and need not be carried out until a selected area is about to be or has been acquired. It is obvious that detailed surveys of areas which are in view for immediate planting need not be delayed until the Preliminary Survey of the whole country has been completed, but as we understand that we are not asked to report as to the selection of specific areas for planting, we have confined our recommendations to Preliminary Surveys only.4. Basis of a Survey. Obviously the sources of our knowledge as to the timber-growing capacity of waste land are the existing woodlands growing on land of similar character. Such woods are often of an unsatisfactory character, having been planted with unsuitable species or improperly tended ; but defective as they maybe, they still afford valuable. evidence. We are very strongly of opinion, therefore, that an essential feature of a survey of waste land is a thorough study of any existing woodlands, leading up to a reasoned statement of the silvicultural conditions in the district. Only when such data have been collected and correlated can the mapping of waste land be conducted on safe lines. From this evidence it should be possible to exclude with sufficient accuracy the types of land which will not produce a certaiu minimum amount of timber in a stated time. Taking all considerations into account, we suggest that a production of 40 cubic feet per acre per annum, including thinnings, would be a reasonable minimum to insist upon.We are particularly anxious that the bases on which a survey is conducted should be very carefully laid down and recorded, so that if afforestation is not carried out in the immediate future ou the land in question, the evidence on which the survey was based will still be available for future reference.Method of conducting Surveys.5. A staff of men trained in silviculture is required, and in order to ensure uniform results and methods of classification it is desirable that the same men should be kept more or less constantly on survey work. For field work maps on the 6-inch scale are perhaps the most suitable.There should be selected as units of survey fairly large districts with well-marked topographical boundaries, in which from a superficial examination a large proportion of plantable land appears to exist. The formation of units in this way will enable a comprehensive view to be taken of the agricultural, silvicultural and other interests. Suitable districts have already been noted by the forestry branches, and this will permit the early preliminary surveys to be directed to the best advantage.Each district should be divided into a number of &quot; divisions &quot; (not necessarily of equal area), demarcated by convenient natural boundaries, by unplantable or agricultural land, and forming compact areas of fairly uniform character. The divisions should be given each a separate number, the boundaries should be marked on the maps, and a brief record made of the silvicultural conditions.The first stage in the field work is, as we have already stated, the collection and correlation of silvicultural data from which the general limits of afforestable land would be determined, and broad instructions issued accordingly for the guidance of surveyors. In mapping mountain land the surveyors should, first mark, on the field maps the higher limit of afforestable land, and having done so should proceed to traverse the land below, which is potentially afforestable, recording on their maps as they go the localwhat proportion of the total area held by Local Authorities is afforestable. A survey made by the Board of Agriculture of the Birmingham Corporation^ land at Rhayader disclosed 6,000 acres of suitable land. After making deductions for altitude and exposure, unsuitable soil, &amp;c, it would probably be found that the total area fit^for afforestation is not less than 50,000 acres, and may be considerably more.
219conditions with regard to soil, exposure, soil covering, &amp;c, in so far as they affect timber production, and excluding areas which are unsuitable for afforestation, either because the productivity falls below the permissible minimum or because the land is arable, or for other reasons.Fair copies should be made of the field maps, and coloured to show plantable, unplantable, agricultural land and woodland. These maps and the divisional records should be bouud up in book form with cross references. It would then be possible to judge at any time, without further inspection, whether any of the land surveyed which subsequently comes into the market is worthy of consideration for planting purposes.Recommendations.6. We recommend that the survey should be begun as soon as the necessary staff can be organised. The field staff should consist of not less than four but preferably six officers, who, to begin with, would work together in a single district. We suggest that the beginning should be made in England and Wales in the spring, the party proceeding to Scotland in the summer and to Ireland in the autumn. In this wav a considerable area representative of the United Kingdom will have been surveyed by the end of 1917 ; survey methods will have been standardised, and the nucleus provided for rapid growth of the work.In addition to the field staff, the necessary clerical staff should be provided.From our general acquaintance with the United Kingdom we recommend that the first surveys be started in the following centres in which areas in addition to those already surveyed &quot;are likely to yield a large proportion of plantable land : (1) Border counties of England and Wales, Northumberland.(2) Aberdeen, Roxburgh, Argyllshire.(3) Cork, Waterford and Tipperary. ,We beg to recommend, finally, that the survey work be begun early in April next, and that proper provision be made for expenditure not already provided for in connection therewith.(Signed)      A.

Schedule D instead of under Schedule B.   In that case the profits from the occupation are calculated for assessment under Schedule D in the same manner as profits arising from a trade.5. Where an occupier of woodlands wishes to be assessed under Schedule D in lieu of Schedule B the Conditions to following conditions must be observed:  be observed.(a) A notice in writing to that effect must be delivered to the Surveyor of Taxes for the district either Notice to bepersonally or by registered post not later than the 5th day of June in the year of assessment given.

Basis of assess-ment.Schedule D.Date to which accounts are to be made up.Form of accounts.Appeals.Diminution of profit owing to the war.Bepayment of tax suffered on other income as against loss incurred in the occupation of woodlands.Information obtainable from the sur-veyor of taxes.(e) The election to be assessed under Schedule D in lieu of Schedule B not only has effect as respects the year of assessment for which the election is made, but is binding for all future years of assessment, so long as the icoodlands are occupied by the person making the election.6. The normal basis of assessment under Schedule D is the average profit for the three years immediately preceding the year of assessment, but in the case of newly planted or replanted woodlands (see paragraph 5 (d)) the computation of the profit falls to be made as in the case of a business newly set up,- no regard being had to the profits or losses arising from the land in question prior to the date of planting or replanting.7. The income tax year begins on the 6th April and ends the following 5th April. The yearly-accounts on which the returns for assessment is based are to be made up to the 5th April, or to such other date within the year immediately preceding the year of assessment to which the accounts have usually been made up. Thus for the income tax assessment for the year 1916-17, commencing on the 6th April, 1916, if the accounts are made up annually to the 5th April, the figures for the three years to 5th April, 1916, would form the basis ; if the accounts are made up annually to 31st December the figures for the three years to the 31st December, 1915, would be taken.8. Where woodlands are managed on a commercial basis but accounts have not been made up each year of any regular plan, no objection will be raised by the Commissioners to the profits being computed on the basis of cash accounts. A form of cash account for the use of occupiers of woodlands who are assessed under Schedule D can be obtained from the Surveyor of Taxes. A copy of the form appears at the end of this Memorandum.9. If an occupier of woodlands is dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment made on him under Schedule D, he may, on giving written notice to the Surveyor of Taxes, within the time specified by the notice of assessment, appeal against such assessment. If the assessment has been made by the Special Commissioners the appeal must be to them, but if the assessment was made by the General Commissioners, the appeal may be made either to them or to the Special Commissioners.10. If at the end of the year of assessment the occupier of woodlands, assessed under Schedule D is able to show that his profits during the year have fallen short of the assessment on account of circumstances attributable directly or indirectly to the present war, he may appeal for a revision of his assessment by bringing into the average the current year&apos;s figures, and omitting the figures of the earliest year in the original average. If the profit for the year of assessment is, however, more than this amended average, the reduction would be only to the amount of the profit of the year of assessment.If the occupier of woodlands is a person who, in connection with the present war, is or has been serving during the year of assessment as a member of any of the military or naval forces of the Crown, or in any work abroad of the British Red Cross Society, or the St. John Ambulance Association, or any other body with similar objects, the assessment will be reduced to the amount of the actual profit of the year of assessment, even if this be less than the average of the three years, including the year of assessment.11, Any person assessable under Schedule D for woodlands, mauaged on a commercial basis, who has sustained a loss in any year from the occupation of such woodlands, and who proves the loss to the satisfaction of the General or Special Commissioners, may apply for a repayment of so much of the sum that he has paid for Income Tax as represents tax upon income equal to the amount of his loss.Notice of such application must be given to the Surveyor of Taxes for the district within twelve months after the end of the year of assessment. After having made such an application, however, the applica?it is precluded from bringing into any future calculation of average profits for assessment purposes the amount of any loss on which he has been so repaid.12. Where any further information is required, application should be made to the Surveyor of Taxes for the District.Woodlands. Excess Profits Duty.No charge of Excess Profits Duty will arise in respect of woodlands which are not managed on a commercial basis, nor yet in respect of woodlands Avhich are managed on a commercial basis aud with a view to the realisation of profits if the Income Tax assessment in respect of the occupation is made under Schedule B.   See paragraphs 1 and 4 on page 95.Where a person occupying woodlands which are managed by him on a commercial basis, and with a view to the realisation of profits, has elected to be charged to Income Tax in respect of the occupation of the woodlands under Schedule D, a liability to Excess Profits Duty may in some circumstances arise. Where any information is required on this subject application should be made to the Surveyor of Taxes for the District.Woodlands.-Death Duties.The precise liability of woodlands to death duties depends upon the date of the death upon which the present owner succeeded, aud as claims for duty may mature by the sale of timber many years after such death, it is necessary to set out the liability under the various Acts operative in successive periods, which may have possible application.Succession DutyAct,lS53, s. 23; special provision as to timber.Succession duty on sales of timber.(A.) Deaths between Mat 18th, 1853, and 2nd August 1894.(Succession Duty, under the Succession Duty Act, 1853.)(1) Prior to the 2nd August, 1894, upon which date the Finance Act, 1894, came into operation, the only death duty payable in respect of timber was the Succession Duty imposed by the Succession Duty-Act, 1853. That Act, while imposing a duty upon real property, calculated upon the value of the net income of the property for the successors life, to which any person became beneficially, entitled upon a death on or since the 19th May, 1853, contained a special provision with regard to the Timber, &amp;c. growing ou such property.(2) That provision is to the effect that where growing timber, trees, or wood, not being coppice or underwood, are comprised in a succession, Succession Duty is to be accounted for and paid, not upon any

Assessment of Woodlands to Income Tax-Schedule D.Statement made by Mr. McKenna in the House of Commons, 17th July 1916.&quot; The Hod. Member was good enough to write to me aud to say that he desired to get a clear statement as to the effect of clause 38. As I admit that it is somewhat difficult to construe in its actual words, I have had prepared&apos;a statement which, if the House will allow me, I would like to&apos;read, as it sets out in a verv clear form what is the actual effect of clause 38. I propose to take a concrete case of a man, whom I will call X, who has lands which he proposes to plant or re-plant with timber. Within a year of the planting X satisfies either, the General Commissioners or the Special Commissioners that he is managing the newly pl an ted woodlands on a commercial basis,; he elects for Schedule D assessment and intimates that these woodlands are to be treated as a separate area a distinct unit for Income Tax purposes. . That is to say, these woodlands, which are to be managed purely on a commercial basis, are cut out for Income Tax purposes from, the rest of the estates, and are&apos;to be assessed on Schedule D basis. On the conclusion of the first year&apos;s operations X&apos;s accounts will show a loss, obviously. There will be an excess of expenditure over receipts because he does not cut his timber in.the first year-indeed, for some years there will be little or nothing to show in the way of receipts. X will.have paid Income Tax under Schedule A upou the rental value of the woodlands, and he will now come forward to invoke the aid of&apos; subsection (3) of clause 38. Suppose the net Schedule A assessment to be 500/., and the losses shown on the year&apos;? account to be 300/., without charging anything for rent. The Joss for Income Tax purposes will be 800/., and X will be repaid the whole of the Schedule A tax that is on .500/. and further tax on 300/. of his other taxed income. That is to say, where he has no profit, but a loss, he is repaid Schedule A tax, and he is repaid out of his other Income Tax the tax which he has paid in respect of a sum equal to his loss. This process will go on until the tide turns, and when profits begin to be realised X will be assessed for them uuder Schdule I) on a three years&apos; average, deducting, of course, Schedule A assessed value of 500/. as an annual working expense. In this way, over the whole period, from the, first planting until the final cutting, X will have borne Income Tax upon the actual profits realised from the woodlands, neither more nor less. I think that if we are to preveut discouragement of the planting of woodlands we ought to see to it that whoever plants woodlands is charged neither more nor less than any trader who is carrying on business. I have some further points here in the statement which has been prepared, but I think I have covered the whole ground and given a sufficient answer-to my Hon. Friend.&quot; ,,       ...APPENDIX 1.The Financial Aspect of Afforestation.In order to arrive at an estimate of the probable financial returns from afforesting a given area of ground, it is necessary to make estimates, ou the one hand, as to the cost of growing the timber, and on the other hand as to the yields aud values of the timber so produced and the times at which they will be realised.Owing to the long periods of time which must elapse between the formation of a plantation and the final realisation of the crop, it is necessary to make all calculations with compound interest.A. Conifers.1. The Cost of Production will include the cost of the land, of planting and maintaining the planta-tions, of the construction and maintenance of roads, and so on. We have estimated that (a) The cost of planting will be  5 10s. Od. per acre all round, including fencing, draining, beating up, &amp;c.(/)) The cost of administration and protection will be 4s. per acre per annum.(c) The construction and maintenance of roads and other improvements will be 2s. per acre per annum,Rates as well as shooting rents are uncertain items, and have been offset one against the other.* The initial outlay is therefore taken at  5 10s. Od. per acre, and the total annual outgoings at 6s. per acre per annum over the whole rotation.2. Returns. The quantity and value of the timber produced will depend on the kind of tree planted, and on the soil and other conditions, which are difficult to assess separately. We have therefore taken what we believe to be reasonable estimates of the production when grown under average conditions for each of the five species of conifers which are likely to be most widely planted. Those for&apos; Scots pine and spruce are based on detailed statistics collected in Continental countries, but modified by measurements and experience in this country : those for larch and Douglas fir are based on measurements in this country : those for Sitka spruce on. a comparison with common,spruce and on such meagre records as are available for the growth of the species in this country. It is assumed, of course, that when an area is planted the tree best suited to the varyiijg conditions will.be used.These tables represent, as we have explained on page 65, the normal production from relatively small selected areas and make no allowance for contingencies such as damage from wiud, fire, insects, &amp;c.The estimates of money returns given in the tables below represent the value of the standing timber, and the prices per cubic foot are such as were obtainable before the war under good methods of utilisation. It will be noted that the thinnings are recorded as taking place every 10th year. In practice thinnings are made at irregular intervals varying from 5 to 15 years, but no appreciable difference is made in the results when they are regarded for purposes of calculation as accruing every 10th year.* See para. 8, p. 105.APPENDIX 6b.

It may be remarked that the effect of including successive rotations instead of dealing with a single rotation only is comparatively trifling.0 2
APPENDIX 8.Details of Estimated Cost of Afforesting 150,000 Acres in 10 Years.1. Rate of Acquiring the Land. We have assumed on p. 41 that the area of 150,000 acres which is to be afforested by the State in the first 10 years of the scheme will be provided as to one-third by purchase and as to two-thirds by leasing.If an estate of considerable extent is purchased for afforestation it is necessary for technical and other reasons to extend the planting operations over a number of years. According to circumstances the actual periods may vary from as little as 10 years to the length of the whole rotation, which may be as much as 80 years or more. It may be assumed, however, that for the State planting schemes which we are recommending the period will range from 10 years for the small estates to 30 years for the large ones with an average of about 20 years. It follows then, with a steadily expanding plan of planting operations, that the area which must be acquired in the first few years will be much greater than the actual area planted.Where land is leased, on the other hand, it is not necessary to secure land so far iu advance. Advantage can be taken of breaks in the leases of occupying tenants to take over, at comparatively short notice, areas which are required for the development of a steady plan of planting in a given district. In this way it should not be necessary as a rule to disturb the occupation of more than one subject at a time, aud we estimate that, on the average, it will be sufficient to have in hand land sufficient for the next four years&apos; plantings.Next, it is necessary to estimate the rate at which the annual plantings must proceed in order that a total area of 150,000 acres may be afforested by the end of the tenth year. Having regard to the initial difficulties which the Forest Authority will have to meet and the great amount of preparatory work which will have to be done before planting operations can be got into full swing, we think that a steadily-expanding programme is required. We have, therefore, assumed that the areas to be.planted will increase in an arithmetical progression beginning with nothing iu the first year and ending with 30,000 acres in the teritb year. If the proportion of one-third ou purchased land to two-thirds on. leased laud is maintained throughout, the planting programme may be set out as in the table below : Planting Programme for the First 10 Years.Year.12 3 4i8 9 10Total11Area to be Planted.On Purchased Land.

The curves reproduced on p. 67 have been obtained in that way, and the values given in the table on p. 66 have been read off from the curves.After making one set of calculations with the yield tables set out above, we have proceeded to reduce the total volume returns for each.of the species by approximately 30 per cent, in order to make a fair allowance for contingencies such as damage by wind, fire, insects, which are liable, when working on a large scale, to reduce the actual yields below the returns to be expected on the basis of yield tables. The reduction has not been made uniformly on thinnings and final fellings alike. Usually the effect of unforeseen damage, such as wind, is to increase the volume of thinnings, at the expense of the final fellings. We nave, therefore, thrown the bulk of the reduction on to the final fellings. Thus, in the case of Sitka Spruce we have increased the thinnings and decreased the final fellings as follows : thinnings, 20th year, 100 (against 50 cubic feet) ; 30th year, 200 (150) ; 40th year, 400 (300) ; 50th year, 600 (500) ; 60th year, 700 (600) ; final fellings, 70th year, 4,000 (7,400) ; total production, 6,000 (9,000) cubic feet.The same prices for the timber have been adopted for both sets of calculations.B. Hardwoods.With the exception of ash, which on selected land should give returns equal to the average of the conifers with which we have dealt, hardwoods such as oak and beech will yield at pre-war prices as a rule uot more than 2\ per cent, interest on capital invested in afforestation. The reasons are that hardwoods require a better soil than conifers ; they do not produce so great a volume of timber, although the timber is more valuable per cubic foot; the thinnings are longer delayed and not so readily saleable ; and, finally, the rotation is longer. Broadly speaking, hardwoods will require from 100-120 years to reach maturity, against 60-80 years for conifers, and the.result of the 40 years extension in the rotation is to increase very materially the amounts to which expenditure grows under the working of compound interest.
223loaWith, the above programme in view the areas which must be purchased and leased respectively year by year can be worked out.2. Area to be Purchased. We have estimated on the basis : (a) That land must be purchased one year before planting begins on it in order that effective possession may be secured ;(6) That individual estates are planted up on the average in 20 years ; (V) That two-thirds of the land which is purchased is plantable ;In the table below column (2) shows the area which is to be planted according to plan and column (3) the area which must be held on the assumption that one-twentieth is planted )rear by year. Since, however, only two-thirds of the land i3 plautable, it is necessary to increase the area by half, and this has been done in column (4) to show the actual areas which must be held. In column (5j is stated the area which must he purchased to provide in the first year the area required for planting in the second year, and in the socorid and subsequent years the additional area required in the succeeding year on account of the larger planting programme. The remaining columns show what areas the annual purchases will provide year by year, and the area remaining to plant at the end of the tenth year.Table L Showing the Rate at which Land should be Purchased.Year.0)Area to be Affores-ted.(2)Area: which must be held on basis 25th plantedper Annum.on:12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10Total -Acres.

In addition there will be 25,000 acres of unplantable land already disturbed by afforesting 50,000 acres and 86,000 acres of similar land attached to the implanted but afforestable land.It may be well to give some further consideration to this fact. The total area to be afforested in the first 40 years is 1,180,U00 acres, of which 200,000 acres fall in the first decade, and consequently on the average rather less than 330,000 acres in each of the three succeeding decades. The area purchased in the first 10 years would provide, if the rate of. planting continues as in the 10th year, 100,000 acres in the second decade, leaving a surplus of 72,000 acres still to be afforested in the third decade. By the 30th year, therefore, 222,000 acres would have been planted on purchased land out of a total of 860,000 acres afforested by the State. It will probably be found that the proportion is not too large, and if it is not large enough, purchases in the second and third decades can be regulated accordingly.It will be- seen that the area of plantable land in hand at the end of the 10th year deoends upon the pace at which land is bought during the 10-year period, and the method of uniform purchase for each of the 10 years makes the area large. That method, however, has a very great advantage in practice, since it permits the Authority to work with a uniform acceleration and consequently to develop its operations in an orderly way and with least risk of failure in the early stages.The amount of land unplanted at the end of the 10th year would be reduced to a minimum either by purchasing in the first year all the land required for the 10 years&apos; planting, in which case the total area to be acquired in order to plant 50,000 acres would be 150,000 instead of 333,000 acres as in the table above, or by planting each estate during a shorter period than 20 years. The first of these two methods would practically be impossible and at any rate involve heavy expenditure during the first year of operations. The second method would create considerable difficulty in the management of the woods and produce uneven returns in the future.   Hence we cannot recommend either of them. .Moreover, it is impossible to say whether the Forest Authority will succeed in leasing a sufficient area to make up the total of 150,000 acres to be planted by direct action of the State during the first 10 years. For this reason also it will be desirable to provide for any deficiency by having a sufficient area of purchased land available.3. Area to be Leased. In the table below column (2) shows the area which is to be planted according to plan, column (3) the new areas which must be taken up year by year to provide in advance land for the next four years&apos; planting, column (4) the total area leased, and . column (5) the area (exclusive of unplantable land attached to the planted land) which is available for re-letting until required for planting operations.O 3

Cost of Acquiring the Land. We have estimated that, iu the case of purchase, the average cost of the land will rbe 3/. per acre, and that in the case of leasing, the average rental will be 3s. per acre per annum. On this basis the total cost of the land acquired by purchase in the first 10 years will be 999,000/. and the total outgoings in rents of the land leased will be 158,040/. Further details are given in Table III. below,5, Cost of Afforestation Operations. We have estimated on the following basis: (a) Cost of planting 5/. 10s. per acre including the provision of plants, drainage, aud fencing; (6) Equipment, including new buildings and repairs to existing buildings, 15*. per acre planted : ,&apos; (c) Local superyision*  1 per acre planted.General supervision and administration are provided for separately under the head of &quot; Establishment Charges.&quot;   (See p. 69.)To afforest 150,000 acres, therefore, will cost 825,000/. for planting, 112,500/. for equipment, and 150,000/. for local supervision, a total of 1,087,500/.6. Cost of Acquisition of Land and Afforestation Operations. The table below sets out the estimated expenditure year by year in respect of purchase and rent of land and of planting up 150,000 acres.

Purchase, of Sheep Stock and Acclimatisation Values.-\\\ connection with the purchase or leasing of:graziug:Tand provision must also.be made for the taking over of sheep stock and compensation for acclimatisation values. This is a matter ou which we have found it very difficult to make an accurate estimate owing to very great differences in practice in various parts of the country. It is sometimes the custom that the incoming tenant or the landlord purchases the sheep from the outgoing tenant at market... * In the. ^Financial Aspect of Afforestation,&quot; p. 100, the cost of supervision:-has. been placed at 4.9. per acre per annum which is equivalent&apos;to a capital sum of il. p&apos;er acre oh a 5 per cent, basis, or ol. per acre oh a 4 per cent, basis.: Tt&apos;is estimated above that iZ. per acre will be paid in the first year and&apos; the remaining 3Z. or 4Z., as the case may be, is intended to cover inspection and administration, and the local supervision which the plantations will again require when thinnings begin 15-25 years after planting. &apos; ,
value, plus some amount which represents or is supposed to represent the special value of the sheep from a climatic or local point of view in relation to the particular sheep ground. This additional payment varies greatly. It may be absent altogether or it may be from 10s. to 18*. per sheep. In the same way also the stock on the types of land which we have in view for afforestation purposes may range from one sheep per acre to 5 acres per sheep. In the absence of concrete examples for acquisition it is practically impossible to estimate for our proposed scheme with any pretence to accuracy. No doubt the Forest Authority would take due account of acclimatisation values in selecting land, but it will not be possible to avoid dealing with the subject altogether. Similarly the Authority will be unable to avoid purchasing sheep, but here also the custom as between outgoing tenant and ingoing tenant or owner varies widely. While the Authority will no doubt desire to dispose of any superfluous sheep stock which it may have to acquire, as rapidly as it can without incurring losses, it is clear that it may be forced for one reason or auotner te hold considerable numbers at any one time.In these circumstances we have thought it necessary to include a definite sum in our estimate and have calculated on the basis that on the average an outlay of IZ. per acre will be necessary for&apos;each acre of land disturbed, and that one third or 6s. 8d. per acre will, be recovered within the ten-year period. By the end of the 10th year some 380,000 acres will have been disturbed in connection with past, current and prospective planting operations, and the net outlay consequently becomes approximately 250,000;&apos;.8, Returns fvpm Land Acquired but not Planted. We have estimated above that it will be necessary to disturb the occupation of land four years, on the average, in advance of planting, that one-third of the land will be uuplaiitable and when separated from the plantable land will return a rent sufficient with shooting rents over the whole to cover rates. We have now to estimate the rents which will be received from all land which is acquired except that planted and the unplantable land connected therewith. The rents.will be obtained from land affected in two different ways by the afforestation scheme :  .(a) In the case of a purchased estate a diminishing area will remain quite undisturbed.   We haveestimated the rental in this case at full aralue, viz., 3s. per acre per annum.(b) In the case of both, purchased estates and leased land, subjects which are disturbed but notcompletely planted will yield a reduced rent on the implanted area.   We have estimated thisrent at two-thirds full value, viz., 2s. per acre per annum. The table below shows for each year the area available for leasing and the amounts which should be received. The total returns for the 10 years amount to 265,770/., of which 215,445/. is from purchased land and 50,325/. from leased land. We estimate that the cost of collecting these rents will be 5 per cent, of the gross rents and the sum of 13,288/. lias consequently to be deducted, leaving 252,482/., which we have rounded off at 250,000/.Table IV.
