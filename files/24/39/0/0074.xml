I .337I P ^ &quot;j TB       i     IT  i    * t-    st) P     V  &quot;D    T   TT TI SUPPLIES   TO   C^CJh.I Translation of Kemoraiidum from .the President of the1 Council of the French Republic to the Prime minister.I it the Inter-Allied Conferences concerning the re-or^anisa1 tion of the Greek Army, held in Faris on August 51 and Sept-f ember 5 last, it was decided that the material and supplies&quot;j necessary for the organisation and upkeep of that ArmyI should be furnished :.n part by France end in part by Great) Britain (see Statements:hA&apos;- and hB&quot; annexed).   It was alsoj decided that a certain number of commodities, the deliveryj of which neither of these two Powers could undertake, should1 be required of -America (see Statement &quot;CK annexed),At the present time France has delivered to Greece the larger pert of the supplies representing her share.   The whole would have been supplied&quot;but for insufficient shipping space.However, Id.Venizelos having expressed the intention of ordering general mobilisation in Greece at the beginning of February, 1918, our transport cervices have been asked to make en additional effort&quot;&quot;.   There is reason to hope that the supplies due from France, necessary for the equipment of the expected Divisions, will be sent off before that date.According to the information I have received, Great Britain has delivered to Greece the supplies mentioned in Statement &quot;B&quot;.   If the terms of this statement ere correct these supplies do not include wheat, and in respect to other foodstuffs these supplies would seem to represent one month&apos;s rationing of the Greek troops at this moment under erms in the interior of the country.In the course of en interview with General Foch II. Venizelos   during his last visit to Paris, ashed that stocks of food should be made ready at Port Said by January 1st, sufficient to feed all the troops mobilised in Greece (some 300,000/men) in order that he might order mobilisation at the beginning of February,   The estimated time necessary to snip tnese stocks to Greece, by means of the vessels left at ohe disposal of that Power,&quot;was about a month.After this interview General Foch drew the attention:: of the British Staff to the importance of this question, however, up to the present I have only been informed that the Britisn Departments concerned are doing their utmost to ensure delivery; I have not been able to get precise inform-ation as to the date at which we may expect the matter to be finally settled.
It follows that at this moment the Greek&apos; Government is S^Ul, unable to know at what date the provisions necessary for the upkeep of its mobilised Army will be at its disposal, Meanwhile the provisioning of the Greek troops on the Macedonian Front ( some 50,000 men and 10,000 animals) is still effected by the French Army in the East .Your Excellency will not fail to perceive that, in.the present state of our supplies and means of transport, this is a very heavy burden for   France which, according to the terms of last September , she should not be called upon to bear-.As to the United States , no reply has yet been received from them to the request of both our Governments , made on the 20th September last, concerning assistance to Greece.     The interviews our High Commissioner in Washington has had with the American authorities on this subject furnish little hope of a completely satisf*c*iJory solution.For these various reasons the mobilisation of the Greek Army may be delayed or even compromised ,   France is absolutely unable to deliver the goods that America has been asked to supply.   She is even forced to foresee the possibility fchat the situation of her own troops in the East may prevent her from continuing to supply the Greek forces on the Macedonian Front.I therefore ask you to be good enough to hasten the de-livery to Greece of all that the British Government undertook to furnish, especially foodstuffs.I trust you will also see fit to have a statement prepared, in concert, with our representatives, of the quantity of pro-visions which France has up to date supplied to the Greek Army, in order that the equivalent of these provisions may be included in the supplies to the French Army In the East.Finally, I should be greatly obliged if you would inform me in what manner you think further steps could be taken by our t;,-\ Governments to obtain from the United States a favour-able reply to the demands made on behMf of Greece .Relying on the declarations made by your Excellency at the last meeting of the Supreme War Council, and to the solicitude you then expressed on behalf of Greece, I venture to hope that the British Government will undertake to supply the Greek&apos;        with anything that the United States might fail to furnish.(Sd.) CLEMENCEAU .Paris .January 14th, 1S18.
