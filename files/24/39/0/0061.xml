Note by the Secretary.

With reference to War Cabinet 297, Minute 29, I an informed by the Admiralty that the present arrangement is as

follows :-

"Advice upon all large naval questions affecting military operations will be given to the Supreme War Council either by the Inter-Allied Naval Council, or by the Chief of the Staff of the Admiralty concerned, as the circumtances may require. The British naval officer who is at all times available for daily discussions of minor naval matters at Versailles, is Commodore Moston-Ellis, the British Naval Liaison Officer in Paris. 

This matter is, however, going to be discussed at the forthcoming meeting of the Inter-Allied Naval Council and in this connection the following appears on the Agenda for the Meeting:-

"Relations with the Supreme War Council and the desirability of the representation of the Inter-Allied Naval Council at the Supreme War Council".
