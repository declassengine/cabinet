REPORT  OF  THE  PRESIDENT . OF  THE   BOiRD  OF  EDUCATION.During the past few weeks I have received a number of Deputations from Educational Bodies, with whom I have discussed certain modifications in the Education Bill, in particular in regard to the Administrative Clauses.   A large amount of agreement has been reached on the various points at issue and in the result I have made certain amendments in the revised Bill which I introduced in the House of Commons on the 14th January.An important Conference of Government Departments has been held at the Board1s Offices on the question of the education of juveniles in their employ, as a result of which I hope it will be possible to improve and co-ordinate the facilities for continuing the education of the large number of young persons who are now in the service of the GovernmentI have also held a Conference with the Minister *f Labour on the relations between the two Departments* in regard to work under the Education (Choice of Employment) Act.The staff of the Department has been largely occupied in administering the new Regulations which have been issued during the past few months, in revising certain Clauses in the Education Bill, and in preparing for the developments which are contemplated under its provisions.
