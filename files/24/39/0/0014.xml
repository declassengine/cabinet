SUMMARY 01&quot; BLOCiCADJsi IMQ&amp;UTIQM4th - 10th Jan, 1918.1. PJBgMABg.   We have refused to pay the excessive prices asked byDanes have exported 400 tons of this butter to Norway and Sweden and propose to send another hundred tons to Finland,IQBffAY.   The Sorwegian Government apparently intend to postpone their reply to the American proposals for a general Agreement. They represent that the Storting is not in session and that many members of the Committee for Foreign Affairs are away. Meanwhile they ask for provisional supplies of American grain,petroleum and phosphates and offer in return to limit their exports of fish to Germany to 4,000 tons a month.   The United States have rejected this proposal and informed the Norwegiansthat in the circumstances they propose to publish their original proposals in the liorivegian press.Our Minister at Christiania is informed that the Germans have offered the lorwegians 240,000 tons of grain.3.   SWJSDISN.   The Swedish Government propose to export 15,000 horses toGermany in exchange for coal, salt, aniline dyes and lubri-cants.   It is believed that Germany may also send the Swedes some cereals.   We are urging the Swedes to delay the conclusion of this agreement until our negotiations with their delegateshave already granted licences for the export of 2,400 horses and have reduced the minimum age for horses exported to Germany4.   flBTHJSHLiBPSt   The heads of a draft shipping agreement between theDutch Government and the Allies were accepted by the Dutchdelegates before they left London last week. Under this agree-mentthe Danes for our share of the Danish butter surplus.Thehave resulted in a better understanding.   The Swedes, however,from eight to five years.
512.the Allies would secure for services in which they are directly or indirectly interested(a) All the available Dutch tanker tonnage except 34,000 tons deadweight reserved for Dutch requirements.(b) 85,000 tons deadweight of Dutch shipping for services between the United Kingdom, Prance and the Mediter-ranean.(c) 350,000 tons deadweight of Dutch shipping for services of interest to the Allies between the Far East, the United States and the British Dominions.(d) 600,000 tons deadweight of Dutch shipping directly time-chartered to the Allies, a small proportion of which would be held at the disposal of the Belgian Relief Commission.The Dutch would retain 340,000 tons deadweight of shipping for their domestic requirements and an additional 15,000 tons for their trade with Scandinavia.   The Agreement also safeguards Dutch colonial trade in various ways.   We are prepared to pay the Dutch shipowners 35/- per ton for services in the danger zone and 25/- for services outside that zone.Sir Eyre Crowe has discussed with the Dutdfo Minister in London the transit traffic in sand, gravel and other military materials from Germany to Belgium and the Western Front over the Dutch waterways.   iThis question is now complicated by a large increase in the exports from Holland to Belgium of sand and gravel of Dutch origin.   As a result of Sir Eyre Crowe1 s interview we have suggested to the Dutch Minister that the dispute should be settled on the following lines(1)   The export from Holland to Belgium of sand and gravel of Dutch origin to cease.(2) The Dutch Government to guarantee that no sand or gravel passing through Holland to Belgium will be used for military purposes.(3)   Two lawyers appointed by the British and Dutch Governments to decide what are the legitimate civilian purposes for which these materials may be used.(4)   3?he Dutch Government to set up a system of control
3. 52which will ensure that no sand or gravel will he used otherwise than according to this decision,RUSSIA, A Conference of local representatives has heen opened atArchangel to consider measures for securing the economic unity of the eight Governments of the White Sea basin.   The area con-trolled by these Governments is over 5,000,000 square miles and includes a population of 15,000,000.   Order will probably be maintained by a &quot;militia of supplies&quot;.     The movement is apparently supported by the peasants and is not opposed by the soldiers&apos; and iforkmen8s delegates.   The local Governments will control the timber resources of northern Russia.   They say also be able to secure important supplies of flax, rye and barley; and they have railway facilities for importations from Western Siberia.   They may also be able to secure an entry for British goods into the Russian market.   This local republic should be of some use to us in counteracting the German economic penetra-tion of Russia.SOUTH AMERICA.   The financial arrangements for the purchase of the Argentine grain surplus have now been satisfactorily settled and Sir R, Tower has been authorised to sign the Agreement on -   behalf of H.M. Government.   The British and French Governments engage to buy 2,500,000 tons of Argentine grain or other produce and to open credits in favour of the Argentine Governments of  20,000,000 in London and Fr. 500,000,000 in Paris.   The Argentine Government engage on their side to open a credit in Buenos Aires of $100,000,000 in favour of Great Britain and an equivalent credil in favour of France.   The credits in London and Paris will be used to meet Argentine drafts and Argentine debt services in France and Great Britain,   There will be a fixed rate of exchange as between London, Paris and Buenos Aires.The Chilean Government are apparently concerned for the future of the Chile nitrate industry owing to the extensive
534.development during the war of the trade in artificial nitrate. They have informed the French Government that, if the Allies will undertake to absorb fixed and regular quantities of Chile nitrate for a period of five years, they are prepared to seize the 350,000 tons of enemy shipping sheltering in Chile and to put the vessels at the disposal of the Allies for ten voyages.SUBM/OilM3 CAMPAlGi3.
