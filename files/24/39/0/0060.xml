For this purpose I would suggest that additional means of disseminating information are probably necessary.\ \At the present crisis of the &apos;.7ar it is above all things necessary that public opinion should be thoroughly well instructed and in close touch not only with the views of the Government but as far as possible with the information upon which those views are based, if it is to be kept sane and level-headed during the difficult period which lies ahead.     In fact, it is probably no exaggeration to say that the future destiny of the country depends on how far its people keep their heads during the next few months.Many of those in touch with popular opinion experience grave doubt as to whether the Government have succeeded in the task of naihtaining sympathy between the people and the  Government,, without which it is impossible to expect the former to obey cheerfully the restrictions and discomforts imposed on them by the latter.     To anyone who studies the London and Provincial fress attentively the reason for this is not far to seek.     The Press is, after all, the principal channel through which the Government is able to influence public opinion.     Speakers sent down by the War Aims Committee, pamphlets, and similar means of propaganda are all valuable in their way and much good has undoubtedly been done by them, but the effects which they produce soon pass away, whereas the whole essence of successful propaganda is   constant reiteration of a few fundamental truths through the newspapers which are read every day and furnich. a large part of the arguments which are used by speakers of all kinds. To neglect the Press, therefore, and. to rely principally on public speakers, &amp;o. is a suicidal policy.     It may be said that much has already been done to instruct the Press and to give them information. This is no doubt true as regards the London papers and the big Provincial papers such as the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, &quot;Yorkshire/ post
post&quot;, &amp;c. who have representatives in London,, hat these are not, broadly speaking, the papers whioh reach the homes of the working classes.   What is wanted is to make the best information possible available to the purely local press, especially the local evening papers which are usually bought by working men.   A constant stream of good information and instructed comment in these papers would do more to counteract pacifist activities than any other measure.   The present need for better instruction in the Press is sufficiently obvious. Tlrough sheer ignorance the papers, both London and Provincial, who undoubtedly want to influence public opinion correctly, are constantly playing into the hands of the pacifists either by giving unnecessary advertisement,   or by representing important questions in a false light, or by omitting matters with which the public ought to be ac-quainted.   For example, as-regards the first, quite disproportionate prominence was given to the Labour party War Aims proposals, and tho part played by the I.L.P. in relation to them was nowhere explained.As regards the second and third, there has been no attempt to explain the true situation in regard to the lZ^p advance except by the &quot;Morning Post&quot; and &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, which are largely discounted by their known antipathy to Mr. Churchill.   Similarly, it is quite clear that the Editors of the sound Provincial papers are quite in tho dark on the larger questions which are bound up with War Aims, the present military situation, the political situation in Germany and Austria, and the true nature of the present Russian Government.&quot;    Unless the Government can bring its1 views to the people on each of these questions it is hopeless to expect the man in the street to know where he is, and if his mind is in a state of ignorance and confusion he naturally falls a prey to thoso who try to misrepresent and malign the Government.If the War is to bo prosecuted successfully and the danger of a &quot;psychological catastrophe&quot; is to be averted, I feel that it is absolutely vital that tho Government should take this question in hand.      I understand   that the Foreign   Office
has established Press Afencies in sis of the principal cities in the United States.    It seems to me that at least erual arrangement is necessary at home.     If the need for propaganda in America which is still in the first flush of warlike enthusiasm, is so well-recognised, I submit it is even more urgent here, where the strain of war continued for three and...a-half years is very pronounced, and where every effort is needed -in., order to maintain the firmness and soundness of public-opinion.-I surest, therefore, in the first instance-that on organisation should be formed for giving-direct&quot;information to the Press in all the principal cantres in England and Scotland.-   What is naeded&quot;&apos;is -someone-well-acquainted with ,local., conditions and local people, who would be able to get into touch with the Editors of all the leading papers in the locality, and would supply them with first-hand information on any question which interested them or on which it seemed desirable to give further information.   They would, moreover, watch the pacifist propaganda in the district and apply to Headquarters for any facts which would enable them to refute the arguments which ?/ere being used locally.     Moreover, Headquarters would supply them every day with a summary of important news which might be given out freely to the Press, and also a confidential summary which might be given to the Editors for their confidential information.     In this way the Government would really ensure that important questions were presented In their proper perspective and proportions, and that an effective answer was always forthcoming to local pacifist propaganda.   Above all, it would ensure a continuous stream of the correct information which is essential to the success of any propaganda.There is one further condition of success and that is that there should be far greater frankness on the part
of all Departments in dealing with the public.     One of the&quot; dangers, for instance, which aopears to threaten us is an extensive Bolshevik propaganda in this country.     It has already been begun by Mr. Litvinoff and is bound to become more and more energetic as facilities for communication improve...   It seems to me quite useless to attempt, tc counteract this propaganda by expelling Mr, Litvinoff, by burning his literature, or by suppressing newspapers which produce it, or by any similar methods of violence; which only play into the hands of the extreme element and lend point to their argumentsThere is-, however, a very effective answer to Russian appeals based on a love of freedom in depicting the true state of Russia under the present regime, the massacres which have taken place, the wholesale anarchy, terrorism and barbarity.     It appears, however, that the Foreign Office who must be perfectly aware of all these things, have not taken the press fully into their confidence, and for the success of any propaganda in this country that is absolutely essential.     The same applies to other Departments, especially the Var Office and the Admiralty.     The public cannot&apos;be expected to take a sane view of the JSfaval and Military situation unless they are yiven the materials on which to form an intelligent opinion.     In all these matters it seems to me that the German methods have been far more successful than our own, for they have succeeded in instructing and deluding the public opinion to a degree which is really remarkable..      /hat we want to do is to imitate their methods   with the object of telling the public the truth about things instead of hiding it from them. That in the end would be the most effeotive answer to all pacifist and revolutionary propaganda.
If an establishment wag set up on the lines that I have suggested and given the freedom of excess to information whioh it would need I believe this oould be done with little trouble and expensej and I believe that there is no more vital matter for the Government&apos;s consideration at the present moment.Ministry of Labour. 16.1.1918.G H Poberte
