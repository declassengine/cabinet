flTRflULATED TO THE KING AND WAR CABINET^MEMORANDUM\Professor Oman,TURKEY IN ASIA AND ITS PROBLEMS,&apos; 8r   lr   1918r       .(Suggested by Krr Lloyd George&apos;s Recent Speech)The governing principle in any projected recon^ struction of the territories in Western Asia hitherto under Turkish rule or suzerainty must undoubtedly he that of *the emancipation of nationalities, and the formation of national stateSr    It is of paramount necessity that the accusation of &quot;annexationism&quot; or &quot;Imperialism&quot; now currently made against the Entente powers should he refuted by the programme of recon-struction which they must set forthr    This principle does not, however, make it impossible to recognise zones of special interest to one Entente power or anotherr    But crude partition schemes, such as those of 1915, should be avoidedr    The moral effect of them on public opinion all over the world has been deplor-ablerIt may be presumed that such schemes are now dis-&apos; avowed, when we see Mr, Lloyd George, undoubtedly with the cognizance of our Allies, disclaiming in his speech of January 5thr 1918 any idea of cutting up Anatolia - despite of well known Italian ambitionsr And still more is implied by the recent offer made to the King of the Hedjaz, that an Arab capital should beestablished
este bli6lle(^-a^^ State tobe ruled by his familyr    This State (with certain re-servations in Palestine for the Holy Places, and the projected Jewish national settlement) is of course in-compatible with certain French annexationist plans cur-rent for many yearsr    But nothing would prevent a legitimate French interest being recognised in certain parts of such a national State, just as similar legit-imate British interests would be recognized in. others* These two redent declarations show the principles on which the reconstruction should be carried outPTheir application presents many difficulties, ow** ing to the chaotic geographical distribution of natiorw alities in the North Eastern Section of the present Turkish Empire as shown on the mapr    Anatolias Syria, and the Southern two-thirds of Mesopotamia present only minor problems when the principle of nationalities is appliedr    In Arabia the difficulty is not that of nationality but that of ancient tribal particularism, which has proved fatal to any idea of Arab unity for the last twelfe hundred years, and is as virulent to-day as in any previous century..    But the difficulty which sur*-passes all others is-that of finding any rational solu** ticn for the future administration of the region which may in a general way be called &quot;Armenia&quot;   though it in-cludes much territory that is not peopled by Armenians, and extends over some regions which never formed part cf the Armenian Kingdom of the early Middle Agesr(l)    Armenia,-As Ethnologists are well aware there is no district from Sivas and Kaisarieh to Tiflis, going east, or fromTrebizond
&quot;^bl^mcr^oJU^ in which there isnot (or was not till the massacres of 1915-16) a strongArmenian percentage in the population    But on theother hand there are very few districts in all thatregion in which they form (or formed) the clearly pre**dominant section^    To draw the boundary of a newArmenia so as to include a population of which a major-ity were not Armenians hut Kurds, Turks, etc..,wouldobviously be a negation of the principle of nationalrightsc    The problem has become lamentably hardersince the wholesale massacres or &quot;deportations&quot; of theArmenians of many, districts in 1915-16,wh i chThe only solution of the question/would seem to be both honest and rational would be to throw the Eastern sections of the geographical Armenia into State-con-nexion with the Christian peoples of Caucasia, where there are already over 1,500,000 Armenians within the Russian boundary,.    These even when united to the sur-viving Armenians on Turkish soil would not suffice to form a State for themselves,    But along with the Georgians and other Christian sections of the popular jjion of Caucasia they.would form, the predominant ele-ment in the new State which is undoubtedly about to develop itself in that part of the world,Aether Caucasia in the present Russian chaos be-comes an autonomous State, containing many sectional nationalities, or whether it becomes a federal member of a Russian United State-s makes no difference to the solution suggested above.     It seems certain that Rus-sia will never again be a centralized non-federal State,And
And in most conceivable hypotheses the Armenians would be best placed as members of the Caucasian unit, which must of necessity be already sicP heterogeneous that one more national element in it can easily be accepted , And undoubtedly; this would be a valuable&quot; element in the matter of civilization, energy and businesslike abilitycSuch a solution would contemplate the drawing of the boundary so as to put Erzeroum, Van, Bitlis, etcr, into Caucasia, While leaving Samsun, Tokat, Sivas, Marash, etcr., to the Turkish State in Anatoliar    The boundary would roughly coincide with that of the, terri^ tory at present occupied by the Russian army of the CaucasuscIt may be objected that this leaves out of Armenia the Cilician districts in the far SrWrj (where down to the massacres of 1915 there was a strong Armenian settlement round Sus etcr,) and that Cilicia includes the very important harbour of Alexandretta (Scanderoon) whicfti seems destined in the near future to play an inv-portant part as the point where the Constantinople-Bagdad railway will tap the seaborne commerce of the Lev ant rTo this it may be replied (l) that to draw an Armenian frontier including Alexandretta, we should have to sin against the maihguiding principle of re-construction, as any line- however drawn in this region would throw six times as many non^Armenians as Armen-ians into the new State&apos;s southern extensionBut (2) nothing would prevent Alexandretta from being placed in the projected Syrian-Arabian StaterFor
For if it/separated from Syria by the main range of Mount Amanus, it is also separated from the great Cilician plain by four successive spurs of Amanus which run down to the sea, each with a defile where a bound-ary could be drawnr    Or if it were not wished to put a harbour of such importance into the Syrian-Arabian State it might be insulated with the few miles of coast around it as an international free portr    Either expedient would be better than an unnatural extension of Armeniac There remains on the Armenian side the problem of the Kurdsr     They are inextricably mixed up on the East with districts which can be rationally called Armenian,, They have often been disloyal subjects to the Turks, but they could not settle down as members of an Armenian States    Whether they could be more easily absorbed into a Caucasian State, where there would be several other Mohammedan racial units,, is quite problematical*. A certain amount of their districts could conceivably be left adhering to Anatoliar    But whatever solution is made to the problem, the production of an &quot;oppressed nationality&quot; is distressing?    The Kurds deserve little of their neighbours, and have always been an element of disorder and mediaeval rapine, and it seems hard to give them a rational destination^ ^Zr    ArabiarTribal disintegration has always been thi curse of the1 Arabs r    Bound together for a few generations by the first Mohammedan propaganda, they could not be kept united.    Already by the time of the Abbaside Caliphs great regions of Arabia had slipped out of the controlof
of the newly established central power,.   Arid there has never since been any Arab unity.    Indeed powers that   -have meddled with Arabia have always been able to count on the. particularism which makes one unit give benevolo ent neutrality or even active help to the enemy who at* tacks another unit.     It is sufficient to point out that to-day the King of the Hedjaz cannot knit up a practical alliance, with the Wanabi Emir at Riadh, though both of them are in arms against Turkey and her vassal the Emir of the Ibn-Rashid line in Northern Nejd,    Nor is it comforting to note&apos;that, a year, after the revolt of the Hedjaz the isolated Turkish garrisons in Yemen, com-pletely cut off by that revolt from any recruiting or mu-nitioning, still maintain themselves, and are almost, at the doors of Aden, though.surrounded on all sides by various Arab enemies who ought to unite against thenv Several units continue to give passive or active assist-ance to the Turk,    v7e dole out small supplies of money and munitions to our feeble allies, with apparently little effect in YemeniIt is evident that the predominance of the King of the Hedjaz as the centre of a projected Arabian federation must be supported.    Yet the stronger he is, the less will he be liked by the Wahabis, whom we used formerly to count upon as our most useful Allies in Ara-bia.    With the Turkish danger removed, and their neigh-bours of the Ibn-Rashid connexion depressed^,, the -Wahabis may revert to their ancient pose cf militant fanatics With their hand against every orthodox Arab,     It is notyet
yet a century--Since they sacked Mecca..:   Here is an op** portunity for skilled diplomacy;   hut the King of the Hedjaz seems little inclined to assistr    On the other hand his forces have made themselves very useful in an intermittent fashion-by raids on the Damascus Medina railway, which it may be hoped will continue on a larger sealer /3r    MesdpotamiarTempting asttihe idea of a British annexation, of all or the southern part of Mesopotamia appears, under the Indian Civil Service it would develop into one of the great graiiwproducing districts of the world - it is probable that the repudiation of &quot;Imperialism&quot; must necessitate the putting aside of the notionr    It would seem better to reorganise Mesopotamia as part of the Arab federation, with a definite understanding that it falls into the BrUtish zone of interest, as Syria does into the French,    Basra would probably be reserved as a free port in the same fashion as was suggested for Alexandretta, or given a special British administration The navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates would certainly be placed under British control by,arrangement with the newly created Arab authority,.    Like Basra, Koweit and Mohammerah- require special treatment owing to their existing relations with Great Britain,There will be special difficulties in drawing the Northern boundary of Mesopotamia in the direction of Kurdistan,    The attempt must certainly be made to fol-low the line of racial boundaries so far as is practice able.    On the North-West the boundary will certainlymarch .
march with that of the Syrian part of the Arab federa-tion along the Euphrates as far as the foot of the mountains.    Eastward from, that Joint it will be hard to draw, but will have to be drawn with the aid of the specialist,4,    General Observations,Innumerable problems suggest themselves when the idea of the projected Syrian-Arabian federal State is contemplated.If we judge of the  mentality of the King of the Hedjaz.from his celebrated proclamations against the Turks, and the details of his negotiations with British representatives of late, it must be conceded that the prospect of an Arab Court and Ministry of which he and his family would for, the centre, is not a reassuring one.    No doubt the guidance of such a state by the French and British delegates, who would.have to play the most important part in its organization, would pre-sent all manner of difficulties.    It would be beset by international &quot;concessionaires&quot; who would do their best to play off France against Great Britain* and would secure for themselves protectors among the Arab minis-ters.    Evidently the control by the two interested powers would have to be strict, and the observation of absolute loyalty to each other would be required.    Old Egyptian memories suggest ominous possibilities, ;What part in such a federation would be playi$ by those Arabian units which are at present under British protection, such as Muscat, Koweit,, and the various .
petty Sultans along the Hadramant coast?What will become of the Ihn^Raschid dynasty&apos;s Emirate in Northern Nejd?    Will it be admitted to the federation, or is it more likely to be overrun by the Wahabi power to its southeWill the Wahabis settle down to membership of any federation, considering the history of their rise and their religious propaganda?But these are details, if the Syrian-Arabian State or federation is to be formed, the difficulties must be faced,.   There is no use shirking their existence. However -perplexing they are..,probably--noii-dnsuperable-r .. (Initialled)      C,W,C,OrJanuary .8t u. ,1.918,
