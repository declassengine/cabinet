GOVERNMENT STEAMERSThe s/s &quot;WAR BARON&quot; recently &quot;built at Portland, D.S.A., was torpedoed and sunk on the 5th instant. NORWEGIAN TONNAGE REQUISITIONEDThe s/s &quot;RINGHORN&quot; has been requisitioned, and the &quot;EIDSIVA&quot;, which has been ashore since the 25th December, has now become a total wreck, REMOVAL OF VESSELS FROLI THE BALTICSince the last report the 3 steamers totalling 4,457 gross tons previously reported in Sweden   have arrived safely at Christiania, en route to this country.With regard to the Russian vessels for which negotiations were proceeding, a report has just been received that the Central Baltic Fleet Committee have definitely refused them permission to leave.     The weather conditions are now severe and it cannot be hoped to obtain any further vessels this season, but the Naval Transport Officer considers that there is hope of obtaining either the Russian vessels now refused, or the 8 British and 1 Belgian vessels still remaining in the Baltic on the reopening of navigation,With the addition of the 3 vessels referred to above the number- of British and Allied vessels safely broughyout of the Baltic during the past season-Is 52, with a total gross tonnage of 126,813;    and 4 vessels with a gross tonnage of 7520 have been lost on passage.
Carriage   of   Fuel   Oil in   Double Bottoms of   Liners andCargo   Steamers.   Since the last   report 55 additional   steamershave been fitted for tho above purpose, and 0 ships are   nor fitting.A further 76,76.5 Tons of   Oil   have been loaded, making a   total of 477,268   Tons.A further 79,655   Tons   of   Oil have been delivered,   making a   total of 411,728 Tons.Lost en   route   2552 Tons   making a   total loss of 7,082 TonsITALIAN   COAL SHIPMENTS   The final   figures   of Italian   Coal Shipments   in   December are now available.     The   tota1. was 436,000   tons.   It is feared that   a   considerable   lower figure will be   reached this month owing to the diversion of   so many steamers to   North and South America   to carry V/heat. -inU.S.A.   COAL POSITION      The   disorganisation   referred to/the last report is   apparently   a little   alleviated.   Arrangements have been made   to   send   two or three cargoes   of Coal   from this country   to   America, and bunker coal is being brought   from   Hampton Roads to New   York. *SHIPMENTS OF COAL TO   COLOMBO   The bunker   and   domestic stocks of coal in Ceylon have   recently   been giving   rise    to great anxiety.   To   meet   the immediate   situation   cargoes have   been arranged   by   prompt ships   from&apos; South Africa and   Bombay,   and as   soon as it is possible, to get Tonnage into position the Coal will be   brought   from Calcutta, the   natural source of supply for   Ceylon.MILITARY TRANSPORT. Stores   for American   Army in France.     It has been   arranged with the   American authorities that they should use Swansea   as a terminal port in this   country for the   shipping service   to France,Stores for the British Army in Franco The quantity of military stores, etc In France during the week ended 5th instant was 141,727 tons.
EXCKASGE OF   BRITISH_AND   GERMAN PRISONERS OF TvAR     Therepatriation of these prisoners of V/ar is proceeding, the numberslanded at Boston being:-Military 235Civilian 541Total 576of   which 33 are stretcher   cases and   19 mental   cases.1 civilian   was   lost overboard during the voyage from Holland.The   embarkation at Boston of the Germans   to be repatriated has been interfered with by   bad weather, but the first party of these embarked and sailed, from Boston on the 10th instant.RESULTS OF CONVOY SYSTEM   Mr. Elderton, one of the Statistical Advisers   to this Ministry, has recently made   an examination of the   results of the Convoy system,   /mmj^y mT n mrimui,iuih 1111=3335. fejagggjfcririacgabg^^ sggteseri fabbsfffesfc.   He   points   out thatany   comparison of the   delays under this system with pre-war voyages is entirely   fallacious, as serious   delays, and increase of the length of   voyages by   the adoption of   circuitous   routes, are of course necessitated   by the   submarine   danger, when convoy is not   adopted.   Comparing therefore the length of   voyages, under the convoy system,   not with pre-war voyages, but with pre-convoy voyages during the   war he finds that the   average increase on the round   voyage   i&apos;S   10 days in the case of Atlantic and Gulf   voyages, and   less than 3 days in the Gibraltar and Dakar routes.       Against these comparatively small extra delays he estimates that the losses on   the   round voyage (i.e. including   the   time when vessels were not actually in convoy) have been decreased under the   convoy system by more than one-half.
He   estimates   that the net   result   is that   over a year the vessels now   convoyed will bring in   at   least 1,000,000 tons of Imports more than they   would have   brought un-convoyed, and that at the end of the year   we shall also have more shipping   (probably over 750,000 gross   tons more) than but for the convoy system   would have been   available.I am, Sir,Your obedient   Servant, (Sgd.) GRAEME THOKSOff.
