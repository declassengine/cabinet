CONVOYS. .(a) Homeward Bound Convoys.   Since the last report 10 Convoys consisting of 123 ships (882,900 tons deadweight) have arrived.   Thore wore no casualties.   There are now on passage home 19 convoys consisting of 225 ships.(b) Outward Bound Convoys.   Since the last report, 6 convoys consisting of 53 ships (328,500 tons deadweight) have been oscorted through the danger zone.   There were no casualties of any description.    There are now in the danger zone 6 convoys consisting of 77 ships.2,    FINANCE.During the week ending the 12th instant the sum of  1,190,627 was paid for compensation in the case of total loss of requisitioned ships, making a total of  40,527,397 paid on thi3 account since the 1st April, 1917,3.

5.    CONVEYANCE OF POLES FROM THE UNITED STATES&apos; OF AMERICA.Throe Russian steamers - the s.s. &quot;CZAR&quot;, &quot;CZARITZA&quot; and $rDVINSK,? have been allocated to take Poles from America to France, and a number of the men arc shortly expected to embark at Halifax and New York.6c    EXCHANGE OF BRITISH AND GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR.No information is yot to hand as to the embarkation of the second party of British prisoners at Rotterdam, but this was expected to have takon place on the 16th instant.   It may have been interfered with by weather conditions.Tho German prisoners shipped from Boston last weekhave boen disembarked at Rotterdam, vis:-319    Officers 413    Other ranks 190    Civilians7.    REPATRIATION OF ITALIAN SUBJECTS TO ITALY FOR MILITARY SERVICEUnder the convontion recently concluded with Italy in regard to the liability of Italians in this country for . military service here or in Italy, these men must either be enlisted in the British Army or be repatriated to Italy for service in the Italian Army.    It is anticipated that about one-half of the Italians liable for service will go back to Italy, and the Home Office has approached the Ministry of Shipping in connection with the provision of shipping to repatriate these Italians (about 4,000 men).   The. Home Office has been informed that direct shipment to Italy cannot be arranged, but that small parties could be taken in the ordinary packet vessels from Southampton to Havre, or df that method did not suffice, shiploads could be taken from Folkestone to Boulogne, provided that in the latter case, the Home Office could overcome the railway difficulties at each end.
ffSPATBIATION QZ AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND INVALIDS.There are about 3400 invalids a month requiring - -repatriation to Australia and New Zealand.   These have hitherto been sent to Australasia via the Cape in vessels which, in viow of the present shipping situation, it is considered might be more economically employed in. service of greater urgency nearer at hand.    A conference has been held with the Australian and New Zealand military representatives, and proposals are now under consideration hy the Ministry of Shipping to readjust the shipping services in such a way that the vessels now engaged in making the voyage to Australia can be more economically utilised, the invalids being either taken to Durban in cargo carrying vessels^ or to California via Halifax or New York and conveyed on to Australasia in passenger vessels.mm QQAt m italy.It has been arranged with the French Government that 150,000 tons of French Coal should be supplied per month from South Franco to Italy to start immediately.   Of this quantity all but 10,000 tons will go by rail.This represents an immediate relief to British Shipping of about 100,000 tons per month.Later on, the French expect to increase the quantity of coal supplied from South French Mines to Italy to 350,000 tons per month and when this becomes effective there will be a saving to British Shipping of 250,000 tons per month.COAL POSITION IN PANADA.The shortage of coal already reportod as regards tho United States is also very serious now in Canada.   To alleviate the position, arrangements are being made to send coal from this Country in two or three ships which would otherwise go there in ballast.
UNITED STATES GOAL POSITION.There is apparently very little improvement as regards the supply of coal for bunkers and the American seaboard ships are still being held up owing to the shortage,COAL SHIPMENT TO SPAIN.In view of the completion of tho Anglo-Spanish Agreement it was hoped that Spanish Steamers would immediately be sent to the United Kingdom to fetch all the coal required by Spain in accordance with the agreement.   No such action has, however, yet been taken by the Spanish Government, the number of Spanish ships trading between here and Spain at present boing much too small to meet the Spanish requirements. The British Government is directly interested in the Spanish ships coming here in good numbers as so many Spanish firms are working for the Allies1 and a great part of their shipments of coal have to be made in British or neutral vessels.It is hoped that when the Spanish steamers do start coming here, these firms1 requirements can be met by them and not by British or neutrals. .RUSSIAN POSITION.There is very little alteration in the position since the last report.   There are now only six vessels with Coal and General Cargo at Murmansk and one of these, anc American vessel, may already have left for the United Kingdom to discharge her warlike cargo, having already discharged her non-warlike portion.   Of the other vessels, one is a British Collier, the s.s, &quot;ATLAS&quot;,, and the other four are Russian vessels.   At Archangel there are five Russian vessels, four are expected to leave almost immediately and the fifth, which is badly damaged, remains for winter.   One other vessel, theBritish
British s.s. &quot;ULIDIA&quot;, seriously damaged, remains for Winter.All the Naval Transport staff at Archangel have left and gone to Murmansk, and of these only 11 now remain there.One American vessel with non-warlike cargo and foodstuffs is en route from New York to Murmansk and another is loading.    One. British Collier is en route and another is loading but no General Cargo vessels are contemplated.The Food position in tho Murmansk region is reported satisfactory.i am,Sir,(signed)  John Anderson.
