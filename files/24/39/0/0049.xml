January 14th.CONFIDENTIAL.     Please deliver following:&quot;General Sir William Robertson, Chief of Staff, British Army:-1,     With reference to cur Conference in Paris I have forwarded by cable to Washington the substance of your Memoran-dum of Jan, 10th,My cable suggested that your request for battalions Of Infantry for service with British Army, three battalions for each of 50 divisions be given serious consideration, and if adopted that following points be carried out.   First that the plans be regarded as a temporary measure to meet a probable emergency.   Second that as soon as practicable the remaining troops cf our divisions thus temporarily disorganised be brought over and the divisions be reorganised for service with our own Army.     Third, that the division, brigade and regimental com-manders and their staffs of such Infantry be sent over for train-ing with corresponding British Units.     Fourth that the Infantry be taken from those divisions that could not otherwise be trans-ported until after June.     Fifth that only such battalions or . other Units be attached to British Army as could be provided with sea transportation by the British Government,     Sixth that the transportation of such battalions should in no way interfere with the present plans and means of transporting American Army to France,     Seventh that above proposition controllable entirely apart and separate from any plans for sending over our own Forces in our own ships through Brest, Southampton or otherwise. Eighth that battalions loaned to British are to be returned to the American Army when called for, probably when the remaining troops of the divisions to which they pertain are brought over.2t     Information has been received from Washington that two ships, the Mauritania and Aquitania, have been mentioned as available for transporting these extra troops.   It is my under-standing also that we may still take advantage of the offer made by the Commander-in-chief British Army regarding areas of train-ing for American Troops and their supply by British Army during periods of training and so forth as presented in the Memorandum by General Butler,3.     In view of the national sentiment in our Country against service under an allied flag at this&apos;time, it is deemed of the utmost importance, if the above plan is to be considered? by our Government, that the British Government state itsFrom:-. To:-Subject:-
purpose to exert every energy to keep its own Forces as strong in man-po^er as possible.     Only with this general understanding in America would the foregoing plans meet with approval there.    I have cabled the substance of this vievr to Washington and would request a full statement from, you as to British resources in this regard including those at present available and to become avail-able during this year-       This information is desired in order that our Government may have all the facts before making a final decision on the important question now under advisement.-PBRSRIriG.
C.I.G.S.0.1/135/388.SECRET.General J.J. Pershing,Commanding American Army in France.In accordance with your wishes I forward this memorandum explanatory of the request of the British Government that you will consider the question of supply-Ing some American battalions for temporary employment with British infantry brigades.     We have verbally discussed the matter at some length during the last two days, and as you are aware the present request is the same as that made to Colonel House by Mr. Lloyd George on 2nd December last, except that it now refers to battalions only and not, as previously, to companies or battalions.It is obvious that Germany may be expected to strive her utmost, if not to win outright to place herself at any rate in a winning position during the next 7 or 8 months.     Russia&apos;s defection enables her greatly to strengthen her forces on the West or Italian front or on both, and for the last 3 months German divisions have been coining over as quickly as they can be transported.     Italy is still weak and will probably continue to require British and French assistance.     The man-povrer of Prance is rapidly diminishing.     The British divisions are being reduced from 12 to 9 battalions because of the shortage of men and it will be difficult for us to maintain at strength even the 9-battalion division throughout the year.     There are already 28 more German divisions on the West front than a year ago; there are 11 fewer British andFrench
French divisions  (gone to Italy), making a net gain to Germany of 39 divisions; she can easily bring over 40 more divisions by May, as well as a large number of heavy guns; and as shown above, the British divisions will in future have 25^ less infantry in them than in 1917. The situation istherefore becoming very serious, and it is with considerable anxiety that the British and French authorities look forward to the summer, because even if we hold up the German attack, as we hope to do, our divisions may become so attenuated and exhausted in the process as to be fit for little employ-ment afterwards.     In other words, if France and England do not receive substantial American military assistance before the summer, the assistance America is now preparing may come too late to admit of the Entente securing the kind of peace for which they are fighting.I understand that you cannot give any definite, opinion regarding the amount of your assistance, owing to the uncertainty as to shipping and other things, but that the arrival of 15 divisions by the end of June is the most you hope for, while of course several of these divisions will not be ready to fight for some months later.       In view of probable developments this forecast is, in my opinion,, much too small tc ensure the hostile attack being adequate-ly met.     For this reason the British Government earnestly hope that serious consideration will be given by you to their request for help.The main difficulty in making your help available lies in sea-trans port, and from this point of view it is clear that to bring from America a given number of men with all necessary equipment, horses etc. as complete divisions means an infinitely greater shipping effort than to bring thesame
same number of men as battalions, and without transport of any kind - which could be found by us.     Having regard to the general critical situation and to the shortage of our man-power, my Government is prepared in order to secure infantry reinforcements immediately to run very considerable risks in the reduction of our present stocks of food and war material, in the hope that later on the American commercial fleet as it gradually increases may be abl9 to give compensation for cargo shut out by the carriage of the reinforcements.     All could be done without in any way interfering now or in the future with, the transport for the American Army as at present arranged, and it is estimated that 150,000 additional men (or 150 battalions) could be brought over within 3 or 4 months of the time it is decided to permit of their employment in the manner indicated.     Whether the battalions would be brought to England or to Prance for training, is a matter, with several others, which can be settled later,     They would in any case be trained under your officers, of course.     After being used by battalions in brigades for a sufficient time to become efficient they could, if you so desired, be used as brigades in British Divisions under their own Brigadiers, and later on, If and when required by you, the brigades could be recalled from the British divisions and go to form American divisions.     Everything possible would be dene to meet your wishes In this and all ether respects, although you will I am sure understand that it would net serve any very useful purpose to put these American units Into British formations unless they could remain there for a reasonable period of time - say 4 or 5 months.The great difficulty which confronts you in acceding to the above request is the very natural one cf national sentiment, and the desire to retain national Identity.This.
This is fully appreciated by the British Government, who feelthat if America can accept the proposal she will therebydisplay the greatest possible magnanimity and sacrifice,    Itis* however, a matter of national sentiment on the one hand, andon the other of Germany establishing herself in a winning positionif your assistance does not arrive in time.I understand that you have some 45 divisions in courseof formation, and that to find the battalions I have venturedto suggest you would have to break into these divisions.       Butit is practically certain tnat at least 15 of the 45 cannotreach France this year, and therefore they will be idle till1919 - if.the war lasts as long.     Farther,   I may say that we,vrtien raising our Ne?; Armies, were compelled to break up two ofthese Armies in order to send the battalions, as such to France.Had we not done so we could not have held our own in 1915,You have made two alternative suggestions :-&apos;a)     For us to bring over divisions in place of battalions,(b)     To ?;ithdraw all our infantry from a certain number of divisions and replace them with your battalions.I have already dealt with (a) in discussing transport, - and the 2 or 3 extra divisions which the available tonnage would bring would not, I feel sure, be deemed by my Government sufficient justification for the risks incurred in providing the tonnage.With respect to (b) the effect would be still to leave the divisions partly American and partly British; the change would involve the divisions being out of action for several weeks; and it would have to be made probably at the most critical period of the year.     In fact I do not think it would be possible to attempt making it at the time,
I trust that the above explanation makes everything clear, and I am sure that in the general interest you will give it careful attontion.     As you are av^are the French Prime Minister feels equally with the British Government the inestimable value of the proposal, and has no desire Yrtiatcver to raise difficulties in regard to its application to the French Army as well as to the British Army. .   His only wish is that you should do all you can to help either the French or the British.(sdB) W. R. Robertson,   General.C.I.G .S,PARIS,10th January 1918.
