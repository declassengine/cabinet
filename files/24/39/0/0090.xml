^Tlilg Document is the Property of     ///6 *SECRH*8 Britannic JV?aJ8sty&apos;s Co-.;--nment)Intelligence Bureau,  ^(JDepartment of Information, GHf/007.WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   NORWAY. 711, (Jan. 16th, 1918)The sale of the &quot;Kellner-Partinlon Cermany&quot; to a Horwegian syndicate is perhaps the most recent interesting fact to chrtniele on account of the importance of the &quot;deal&quot; from the financial and internetitnal stand-point.    It was stated officially in Parliament that guarantees had been received from Norway, that chemical wood-pulp should not be exported to ffermany.     The head Company gave orders to the Swedish and flerwegian Companies to observe the regulations binding on British firms trading with the enemy but the Swedish Co. objected, on the groT*nd that it was a Swedish Co, with Swedish Directors.    it was however  stated in Parliament that steps had been taken to ensure compliance with the wishes of the Government.     it is instructive to point out that during 1916 the output of sulphite of the Kellnar-Partington Co. alone was 40.000 - 50.000 tone, whereas the total import into Great Britain from all Swedish sources was inly 23.000 tons.Profeesor Franz Eulenburg, a German professor of Economics, stated recently in an article in the &quot;Welthandel&quot; that &quot;Germany had undoubted-ly received more goods from the Scandinavian countries and Holland than before the war&quot;.    In peace time, he continued, the imports into, as compared with the exports from, Germany were as 5 to 7 or about 4Q$ excess of exports.     This was reversed in v?ar-time in regard to food-stuffs, some of which were bought from Scandinavia but derived fromthe British Empire under the Government license to export.    Prominanother seuroe it is stated that/1916 Germany imported from Scandinavia 1,400,000 tons of food-spiffs, and Sweden is said to be supplying the snemy with no less than 4,000,000 tons of iron-ore a year.
** 2 -A compilation by the National City Bank of Hew York shows that American exports to ^candinavia since the beginning of the war have averaged about four times as much a year as in the years immediately proceeding the war, though imports from Scandinavia show no increase. The average export to the three countries before the war was  8,0C0,0Q0 a year.     In 1917 it was 637,000,000.&apos;     Some of the most remarkable increases were shown in copper and cotton.     It is difficult to determine to what extent these increasing demands on the United States were due to shortage of supplies from Kuxopean countries and especially from Germany.     In 1914 the total imports of the three Scandinavian countries from Germany, Great Britain and Russia were worth about  65 million, to which Germany contributed about half and Great Britain a third.     The average Norwegian imports from Germany and Great Britain are about equal to  8,000,000 a year, with this difference, that from Germany the imports are of manufactured goods, and from Great Britain raw material in the shape of coal.The mo3t astonishing &quot;boom&quot; for a country with so small a pooula-tion as Norway, is reported in the formation of new companies with a capital of about  20,000,000 sterling in 1917, which sum is about double that of 1916 for the same purpose.     In the latter year the capital was raised mostly for shipping companies but in 1917 for Banks and commercial undertakings.The Norwegian Borrd of Shipping hr.ve just issued a report of the Norwegian losses at sea from the commencement of the war to September 1917, giving a total of 646 steamers, of 946,486 tons lost, together with 696 lives.     Of these, 76 steamers of 121.000 tons, absolutely disappeared leaving no trace.     Thirteen Norwegian steamers were sunk on their way home from Argentina, where Count Luxburg was German Minister.
The official figures of the Norwegian Legation of losses at sea due to the war, for 1917 only, amount to 434 vessels of 686,8000 tons, so that about two thirds of the total have been lost last year. During last year also from the same causes, 401 Norwegian sailors were killed and 258 missing.The increase in the receipts of Norwegian owners apoears to be something fantastic.    The offioial figures, which ere probably below the mark, give seven million sterling for 1907, nine million for 1911, eleven million for 1914, twenty-six million fer 1915, and 58 million sterling ftr 1916J    It is not much wonder therefore thfet ship-build-ing of r11 sorts, even of concrete vessels, is being pushed forward, and that contracts for the building of 800,000 tons of shipping have been mode in England and a National Steel Works should be about te be started at Narvik in the North of Norway, where it is said that Spitzbergen coal will be used.On Jan. 14th very stringent food regulations were to come into force, with bread oards and cards for flour, coffee, sugar, etc., and a Conference on fcrade and commerce, in which the three Scandinavian Countties were represented, took place at Christiania early in the nonth, but as to the result of which no report is forthcoming.So much ill-feeling has been aroused against Germany by the sinking of ships and consequent loss of life;   by the discovery of bembs apparently left by Bar^n Rautenfele, whose opeertions extended all over the country, and by acts of espionage and inoendifirism,, that the &quot;Norwegian Waters Association&quot; has passed *: resolution proclaiming r. complete boycott of Germ: ny, German tr-.de, Ger- n shipping -nd Germ;n citizens in Norway.     The Ch-^rn^n si:id th&apos;.t if Ger : n ships were un-ble to lo? d or unload in Norw; y the prohibition -g inst ex-ports could be abolished, end if food -/ere refused to the Ger-^ns they would lecve the country;   r-nd it is authoritatively denied that
the Scandinavian-American Shipping lines will, as has been stated, join the German North Atlantic combine.Communication between Norway and Russia would seem to be absolutely lout off, for the Christiania bankers state that they have recently heard nothing from their branch managers or correspondents.     In future it is stated that no foreigner will be admitted to Norway unless on important business or on business connected with the countries1 supplies, snd private visits will consequently be prohibited.In political matters there is not much to report beyond the fact that emissaries of the German labour organisations came to Christiania and tried to negotiate an agreement for the supoly of coal to the Noimegian Labour Unions.     In return for this favour the Social-Democratic Press was to write favourably about the German Government and the party in the Storting was to get the Fishing Agreemment with England cancelled or modified.     The offer was refused, but the Germans would seem to have been more fortunate in their negotiations!If In Denmark.
