This decision has boon taken in view of.urgent representations from the Admiralty end the General Staff that a good deal of the information contained in the Report and Appendices...particularly the information relating to the problem of landing on       o en beach, might prove of value to the enemy.The war Cabinet are considering -That action is to he-taken - to obtain Parliamentary sanction to this:conclusion and, in the meanwhile, they would be glad if you would treat it as striotly confidential.Yours sincerely, (Signed)       M* Pe A * HAKK3Y *.II.Q.9J*Z.-Q&apos; ...

Valk,Ci . &apos;&quot;&apos;*     3 o10th January 1918,Dear Sir Maurice Henkey,I  in much&apos; obliged for your letter.    The question of publication of the report is of course one entirely for the Cabinet and I do not know- that I have any right to express an opinion.   I way, however, say thst my own view is and always has been that the publication during the war could not do any good and might possibly . do harm.     The only difficulty is the cuestion of the officers whose conduct was called in question but individual interests must give -ay to those of the public.Yours traly, (Signed)     &apos; W. PICIlF^I).
