a Government.SECRET._____s_^MINISTET  OF  FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, January 9, 1918.PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.On Thursday, January 3, Lord Rhondda opened the sixth communal kitchen which has been &quot;established hy the Corporation of West Ham. He expressed some disappointment at the progress made during the last six months in the establishment of communal kitchens throughout the country as he was convinced that they help to alleviate the distress caused by the actual and prospective shortage of food. Orders had been issued empowering local authorities to establish and control communal kitchens, and grants would be made to the authorities which advanced the money ; but the kitchens must be run on business lines and managed without loss.On Saturday, January 5, Lord Rhondda and Mr. Clynes received a deputation on the subject of the proposed Consumers&apos; Council. The following bodies were repre-sented: The Labour Party-Mr. W. C. Anderson, M.P., and Mr. Ben Turner.The Trades Union Congress Rt. Hon. C. W. Bowerman, Messrs. H. Gosling, L.C.C., and Fred Bramley. &apos;     The War Emergency Workers National Council Messrs. J. S. Middleton, secretary, and D. Carmichael.The Industrial Women Workers National Organisation Dr. Marion Phillips, ; Mrs. Hood, and Miss Macarthur.Mr. Clynes explained that the Consumers&apos; Council would act within the Ministry in the interests of the consumer.Representation would be accorded to such national but unpolitical organisations as the Trades Union Congress, the War Emergency Workers National Committee, the Women&apos;s National Industrial Organisation, and the Co-operative Union. The functions of the Council could not be precisely denned at the outset, but his notion was to classify the various Committees working in the Ministry in a series of groups, and that a member of the Council should have a place in every group so formed. In this way the individual members would gain detailed experience, so that when they met together they could offer definite and practical suggestions and advice.Lord Rhondda expressed his entire agreement and sympathy. The Council would not exercise administrative duties, but would have the fullest opportunities of advising him on all matters of importance.It was determined that the number of members, should not exceed 15, and that the Co-operative Union Congress, with whom Mr. Clynes was in communication, should nominate six, a similar number, of nominations to be divided between the Trades Union Congress and the.War Emergency Workers Committee.On January 10 a representative of the Ministry attended a conference held at the Food Production Department of the Board of Agriculture to consider what means could be adopted to remedy the.difficulties experienced by soldiers engaged in agri-cultural work in obtaining supplies of food. The difficulties chiefly affected (a) those engaged on such migratory work as tractor or horse-gang. ploughiug; (b) those engaged on ordinary farm work who are boarded and lodged&apos; either with farmers or in a neighbouring village. It was decided to appeal to the. Army authorities for assistance in the matter.A special branch of the Ministry has: been constituted under the charge of Lieut-Colonel A. .0. Weigall, M.P., as Surveyor of Food Consumption in Public Services, to deal with the question of consumption of food under Government Departments and. other, Public Authorities, and to secure economy in such consumption.a.

Control of Supplies and Prices. Allied Purchases-The following cablegram from Mr. Hoover was transmitted to Lord Rhondda by Mr. Sheldon :-&quot; As the result of our conservation measures we have our storage full of frozen beef, and unless we can get relief we will have to abandon our conservation.   I consider this would be a disaster to the ultimate needs of the Allies as it will greatly destroy the psychology of saving; it should be surely more advantageous to ship from these markets than the Argentine.   Beyond orders in hand for about twenty-five million pounds January and February loading, we should have additional orders of twenty-five million pounds for .-   January and February.   We can now also spare more pork products, and we suggest they should, in addition to. usual orders take one hundred and fifty million pounds in next two or three months to build up stocks in Allied countries.    After March our beef and pork production will decrease.   Will you. present this urgently to Lord Rhondda and other Allied Food Ministers.&quot; Mr. Owen Smith also cabled the text of a letter he had received from the Uuited States Food Administration, in which Mr. Hoover stated that, if the extra shipping facilities could be arranged, the United States Food Administration would give its support to such financial arrangements as might be necessary.After the matter had been discussed at the American Board and with Lord Reading, Lord Rhondda cabled as follows to Mr. Hoover : &quot; In consequence of your cablegram to Mr. Sheldon received January 7th, and after consultation with Treasury and Lord Reading, I have to-day informed Owen Smith that subject to concurrence of United States Government as regards finance we purpose to buy additional 35,000 tons frozen meat for January and February which Owen Smith informs us he hopes will be available ; also the 150 million pounds of pork products mentioned in your cable. I much appreciate your offer to give support to the financial arrange-ments necessary and I trust that no difficulties will prevent our contemplated purchases. I most heartily congratulate you upon the result of your conser-vation measures which comes at a moment when the meat and pork situation has never been worse.&quot;Mr. Owen Smith reports that Sir S. Hardman Lever, who had just returned from Canada, states that the Canadian Finance Minister believes that products to the value of eighty million to one hundred million dollars would be available during 1918 for export to England, exclusive of cheese, and that Canadian producers had declared that unless they could export up to that amount they would be compelled partially to shut down their plants. Mr. Owen Smith pointed out that if the finance authorised for January, February and March might be taken as a fair indication of the monthly credits available for Canada only about 50 per cent, of the exportable surplus of Canada&apos;s food supply could be bought.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. The forms in connection with the Distribution Scheme continue to come in and, though it may be found necessary to allow a short extension in the time permitted for submitting them, it is anticipated that the scheme will be brought into effect on the 1st February 1918.Further progress has been made with the proposal so to amend the Bacon, Ham, and Lard (Provisional Prices) Order, 1917, that each cut may reach all retailers at a uniform rate.&quot;A deputation representing the Food Control Committee and the Trades Unions of Ebbw Vale has been received. It was explained that additional allocation could not be made to districts suffering from an acute shortage until an explicit report on the situation had been received.Butter. A further purchase of 360 tons of butter has been made in the United States of America through the Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive Mission, bringing the total so purchased to 1,200 tons ; the prices range from 44 to 45 cents per lb. f.a.s. in New York. .The Butter (Ireland) Order was issued on 3rd January 1918, prohibiting the export of butter from Ireland except by licence of the Food Controller.The distribution of butter to retailers has been proceeded with this week; since sufficient butter was not available to warrant a special distribution, margarine was requisitioned from multiple shops and distributed with the available butter, in a proportion of 1 lb. of butter to 2 lbs of margarine.   The total amount of butter and
margarine distributed in this way was equivalent to one-eighth of the amount of butter applied for on the basis of supplies of butter in January 1916.Cocoa.-An Advisory Committee has been formed representing all branches of the trade, and will meet on Friday next. The first business is the question of fixing wholesale prices of the raw bean and of manufactured cocoa. A meeting has been held at the Colonial Office to ascertain what prices f.o.b. the various ports will be considered sufficient to ensure a fair return to the native grower in the various colonies, and the wholesale price of the raw bean will be built up on this basis as a starting point.Further inquiries are being instituted into the possible uses of cocoa butter, and the Belgian Relief Authorities have expressed a desire to make experiments with a view to purchasing some quantities of this butter.Coffee. A Sub-Committee to the Advisory Committee has been formed to tabulate and scrutinise the returns of coffee under the Raw Coffee (Returns) Order.Dried Fruits. The Ministry of Shipping state that a ship will be available to carry the balance of our December purchases of currants, and probably some small quantity in addition. The balance of the December contracts is 4,500 tons, and in addition 500 tons were purchased out of the January quantities before the Mission received our instructions to stop buying. If the capacity of the ship in question exceeds 5,000 tons, instructions will be given to the Mission to purchase sufficient currants to load the ship fully.The &quot; Sandon Hall,&quot; with 4,360 tons of dates,, has been torpedoed, and is a total loss. Offers have been received for Carton dates f.o.b. Basra, the buyers undertaking to provide shipment via Bombay. Inquiries are being made to ascertain the possi-bility of obtaining shipment from that port to,the United Kingdom.Two further ships have arrived with a quantity of 200 tons of sultanas, and a further allotment has been made to the Navy and Army Canteen Board.The Californian raisins purchased by this Ministry to replace the raisins taken over from the Swedish Government for the purpose of making plum puddings for the troops, have been sent to New York for shipment.Eggs. The purchase has been concluded of 11,000 cases of Danish eggs, which are now awaiting shipment. The purchase price was 285 kronen per case, and it is proposed to retail the eggs in this country at 35s. the long hundred.Feeding Stuffs. The Food Controller, with the concurrence of the Boards of Agriculture for England and Scotland, has issued an Order enabling farmers with cows in milk to obtain priorhVy in the supply of feeding stuffs for such cows over all other cattle. The Order applies to oil cakes, meal or millers&apos; offals, brewers&apos; and distillers&apos; grains and maize by-products: The farmer will make an application to the Live Stock Commissioner for his area, and, if this is approved, will receive in return a priority certificate to obtain from any licensed dealer up to 6 lbs. of concentrated feeding stuffs per cow per day in the case of rural, and 10 lbs. per cow per day in the case of urban, cows. The effect of this Order will be to earmark for the production of milk up to a maximum ration per cow such feeding stuffs as are available, in accordance with the recommendation recently published by the Astor Committee on the Production and Distribution of Milk.Intoxicating Liquor. The Whisky (Restriction on Sales) Order, 1918, dated 5 January 1918, prohibits sales of whisky by auction except under the authority of the Food Controller, and further prohibits wholesale sales of or dealings in whisky by persons other than manufacturers or licensed wholesale dealers. The expression &quot; wholesale sale &quot; is defined as a sale at any one time to one person of two or more gallons of whisky. The Order does not affect purchases for the purpose of retail sale, or for the purposes of any club within the meaning of the Finance Act, 1910, or a purchase by a person who proves that he is not buying for re-sale.Jam and Fresh Fruit.-A meeting of the Advisory Committee was held on the 8th January, when the prices, for. marmalade for the coming season were fixed, and these will be included in the amended Jam,(Prices) Order, which is expected to be issued in the course of a few days.Shipments of bitter oranges from Spain are now being landed,, and arrangements have been made to purchase the bulk of the crop of Italian bitter oranges.With a view to assisting the production of honey, 3 million sections for beehives have been ordered to be shipped pn: &quot;behalf of the Ministry of Food from,the United, StatCS. ,;:V. Cl &apos;   .-..&apos;-&apos;,:! -----  &quot; i -,.    .
Margarine.1-During the last fortnight there has been a falling off in the supplies of margarine, owing to the loss of two factory working days in Christmas week, and to the late arrival of Dutch convoys. It has been possible, however, to arrange for emergency supplies to be distributed in districts where serious disturbance was feared.   - .. .:  ,Meat.-The crisis in the meat trade, which began just before Christmas and is still continuing to a considerable extent, was caused partly by the actual shortage of supplies, but chiefly by the exceptional circumstances of the Christmas trade. In order to secure meat to satisfy the Christinas demand such excessively high prices were given for live stock that to sell within the maximum retail prices was impossible ; butchers threatened to close their shops unless the schedules were revoked, and in many cases Local Food Control Committees relaxed their scales of prices accordingly.It therefore.became necessary to control without delay the price of cattle sold for slaughter, and the Cattle (Sales) Order was issued on 24th December 1917, embodying a portion of the scheme for meat distribution which this Department is preparing. This Order fixed the live weight price of cattle sold for slaughter according to grade or estimated yield of meat. In order to obtain Government control over distribution, it was necessary to set up some machinery for grading, to reauire that all cattle should be brought to market, and to impose a flat rate charge per head of cattle sold.The result of this Order was practically to stop trade for the time being, because farmers were unwilling to send their cattle to market while they were uncertain of the conditions. In order to dissipate this uncertainty, farmers&apos; organisations have under-taken to circularise their members urging them to send cattle to market, and instructions have been issued from this Department to Deputy-Chairmen of Auctioneers&apos; Committees authorising them to employ the services of a dealer to assist in bringing in the cattle in their areas to the grading centres.In order to check the amount of meat which butchers may obtain for their trade, Local Food Control Committees have issued certificates to retailers to buy only up to 50 per cent, of the supplies they obtained in October; local purchasers have been given priority in markets after Admiralty and hospital requirements have been met, and buyers from outside the area can only obtain the surplus stock, if any.These priority arrangements necessarily make it difficult for large towns to obtain their supplies ; in the case of London special arrangements are being made whereby dealers authorised by the Caledonian Market Authority may buy direct from farmers ; the cattle so bought will be graded at special centres, the dealer will be paid the graded price, and the per head charge of oOs. wall be levied at the Caledonian Market where the cattle are allocated to butchers.As very high live weight prices are now being given for sheep, which are being sent to market in large numbers, it is intended shortly to issue an Order limiting the live weight price of sheep, on the same lines as the Cattle (Sales) Order.It has been decided to exempt male lambs bred from Dorset horn ewes from the Live Stock (Restriction of Slaughter) Order until 1st March 1918, as they will not be ready for the market as early as 1st February, which was the date originally fixed in the Order.Oil Seeds.-Steps are being taken to purchase the Indian crop of castor seed in order to provide castor oil for aeroplane engines for the requirements of Great Britain, France, Italy and the United States of America. An arrangement has been concluded whereby funds are provided in the Argentine Republic for the purchase of linseed ; buying will begin at once in quantities relative to the freight space likely to be available for transport to this country.. Steps are also being taken to buy in West Africa palm oil, kernels and ground nuts for the requirements^ of. this country, and application, has been made for freight space for all the West African produce likely to be available.The total of oils, nuts and kernels imported into the United Kingdom represents the following equivalents in tons of oils : 1915    -       ..-        -        -        -     513,380 tons. 1916    -        -        - -     579,690   ,,1917    -        -        -        -        -     368,009  ,,Rabbits.-Aiter January 14, under the provisions of the Rabbits (Prices) Order, the maximum price at which a wild rabbit may be sold will be 2s. if the pelt or skin
ois &quot;included, or Is. 9d. without the skin. For part of a wild rabbit the price will be at the rate of lOeL alb. skinned and cleaned. A Food Committee may vary the maximum price within its area, but may hot increase it without the sanction of the Food Controller. No additional charges may be made for packing, credit, or delivery. Every person selling rabbits by retail in any shop, stand, barrow, or other vehicle must&apos; display conspicuously a notice showing the maximum price. The Order does not apply to live rabbits or to retail sales of cooked rabbits in the ordinary way of trade.  It includes all rabbits whether imported or not, except those bred in captivity.Tea.-Negotiations are in progress with the wholesale trade on the fixing of rates .of profit and allowances for packing under the scheme for the handling of Government tea. The whole scheme is being submitted to the Tea Advisory Committee on the 10th January, and a small deputation will be received on the 11th January in order, if possible, to reach an agreement on the terms proposed.Negotiations are in progress for the purchase of China tea in China. As Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. have refused to accept the rate of commission offered by this Ministry, with the approval of the Costings Department, it will be necessary to enter into negotiations with another house.Local Authorities.Distribution.-Two Food Commissioners report that a serious condition has arisen in a number of areas within their divisions owing to the general scarcity of food which may possibly eventuate in strikes on the part of munition makers and serious riots. The shortage in food is stated to be due to the great increase of population in munition areas which will necessitate a change in the system of allocation and distribution of supplies.In the South Wales Division the continued shortage of margarine, milk, and cheese, and the dislocation of the meat trade appear to have led to unfortunate results. Men engaged in coal mines and steel and tinplate works feel the deprivation keenly and as they are strongly organised trade unionists are in a position to give strong expression to their feeling which at present is undoubtedly extremely tense.The Food Control Committees (Local Distribution) Order, 1917, has had an immediate and widespread effect.Particulars of about 75 schemes framed chiefly by Committees in the industrial centres of the country have already been received. Following upon a meeting held this week in London, a scheme under the Order is being prepared which is designed for general adoption by the Food Control Committees in Greater London and a number of conferences are being held during the coming week (7th to 13th January) by representatives of Committees in the Home Counties who desire to take action in uniformity with the London scheme.It is reported that the action taken in Birmingham is about to be followed by a large number of Committees in the West Midlands with the result that uniformity of procedure appears likely to be secured in a large industrial area with a population of nearly 2 million.A similar process is going on in the Tyneside and many other districts around Newcastle, and also in Manchester and Salford. It is anticipated, moreover, that in Lancashire in general co-ordinated schemes, will be put into force with little delay.Food Committees. The Committees (Disqualification for Membership) Order, 1918, dated 2nd January 1918, provides that conviction for any breach of the Food Controllers Orders shall operate by way of disqualification for membership of any Food or Feeding-stuffs Committee or Sub-Committee as therein defined : Provided that the Food Controller may, on cause shown, direct that such disqualification shall cease. . -Enforcement. The Food Committees have shown themselves increasingly alert in the enforcement of orders. Although in the more populous areas the penalties inflicted may now be regarded as adequate, a considerable amount of undue leniency continues to be shown. This is specially the case in Ireland, and the Irish Food Control Committee have found it necessary to publish a grave warning as to the dangers likely to be caused by the infliction of inadequate penalties.The following convictions may be noted :-Two firms of bakers (Clarks&apos; Bread Co., Ltd., and Gigins, Ltd.) were summoned before the Hove magistrates for selling flour by retail at a pricea 3
exceeding the maximum. There were six summonses in the case of Clarks&apos; Bread Co. and two in that of Gigins. . Fines and costs amounting to 170Z. were imposed on Clarks&apos; Bread Co., Ltd., and 100Z. on Gigins, Ltd.At the Inverness Sheriff Court John Cook, jun., was fined 201. for selling one ton of flour at a price exceeding the maximum.Isaac Alfred Russell, Peckham, Avas summoned at Lambeth by the Camberwell Food Control Committee for selling bread which. had not been made for 12 hours.   A. fine of 201. was imposed..A farmer at Uckfield was fined SOI. and 51. 5s. costs for contravention of the Wheat, Rye, and Rice (Restriction) Order.At Stratford-on-Avon Miss Marie Corelli was fined 501. and 20 guineas costs for hoarding 183 lbs. of sugar.At the same court Mrs. Cundy was fined 10Z. for hoarding 90 lbs. of tea ; the grocer who supplied the tea was fined 251. and costs.Lady Mabel Gore Langton was fined SOI. at Chertsey for having excessive quantities of food stuffs in her possession.At the Mansion House, Stanley F. Ward, of Mincing Lane, was fined 50L and 51. 5s. costs for unlawfully entering into negotiations for the sale or purchase of 500 boxes of dried figs without the authority of the Food Controller.Amedio Allegretti, ice cream manufacturer, was fined 10L at Newcastle Police Court for using 38 lbs. of sugar in excess of the permitted amount in the manufacture of ice cream. &apos;At Merthyr, James Evans, of Carmarthen, was fined 35L on each of two summonses for having bought butter from Cork at prices above the scheduled maximum.Wm. Johnson, Walthamstow, was fined 25L at Stratford for not exhibiting a price list for bacon.Edward Kingston,. butcher, and George Archer, his manager, were summoned at Lambeth Police Court for selling mutton at a higher price than the maximum.   Archer was fined loL, and Kingston 51. and costs.The Peterborough Co-operative Society were fined 150Z. and their three butchers&apos; managers 10c. at the Peterborough Sessions for exceeding the maximum meat prices.The Coalville Co-operative Society were fined 40L* PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION,The most important feature of the week has been the sudden shortage in the meat supply which has manifested itself since Christmas. This is dealt with in the following paragraphs, and figures illustrating it are given in the tables. It will be seen that the failure in the supplies of cattle at the markets followed upon a period in wmich the number,of cattle coming forward was considerably in excess of that for the corresponding weeks in 1916. The position has been considerably accentuated by the limited imports of foreign meat. The whole movement was greatly influenced by the apprehensions entertained as to the impending Cattle Sales Order which came into force on December 27th. The scarcity in beef was partially mitigated by the number of sheep entering the market., r - , , i.      .  Imports.     . .j. 1        .Imports show a considerable recovery over the low record of Christmas week, the aggregate for principal foods (including rice, and tea) being 1-17,000 tons (Table A) for the week ending January 5th as compared with 81*500 tons the. previous week.
	Dec. 9-Dec. 22.	Dec. 23-Jan. 5.	Tons.

Total      - /	-  242,400	.228,800.It will be seen that imports of meat and bacon have fallen off, and less sugar has been received. Butter and margarine have improved, and tea has arrived in sufficient quantities in the last fortnight to cover 3 weeks&apos; normal consumption, including the Army. Imports of oil seeds, &amp;c, in December was 15 per cent, below November, and only 4,700 tons of oil cake arrived.Consumption of Meat..The supply of meat at four principal markets (Table B) has been so much affected by Christmas week that no useful comments can be made on the week ending December 29th. The average weekly supply for December, 1917, of home-fed meat was 8 per cent, below that for December 19.1.6.The records of the supplies of fat stock at 59 markets in Great Britain (Table C) deserve careful study. For the five weeks ending January 2nd, the supply of cattle was 1^- per cent, less than in the corresponding period in the previous year, but the supply of fat sheep was 25 per cent, greater. The preliminary figures for animals slaughtered (Table D), which include, of course, the slaughtering of beasts bought privately, show an increase of cattle as well as of sheep slaughtered over the numbers in December, 1916. The supply of pigs, however, at the cattle markets was only 29 per cent, of that in the previous December, and the supply of foreign meat in December, 1917, was only 64 per cent, of the supply in December, 1916 (Table&apos;B). The index numbers in Table E, though not fully representative of the whole supply of meat, show that consumption of meat generally throughout 1917 has been lower than in 1916. In these figures pig-meat is included. No allowance is made in Table E for any diminution in the. average weight of carcases.If the statistics for December are analysed it will be seen, however, that the figures for the period up to Christmas were as follows : 	&quot;]917.		1916.

In the week ending January 5th, 1918, the supplies of home-fed meat and foreign meat at the Central Market, London, were each 38 per cent, less than in the corresponding week a year ago. Table C also shows a great falling off in the supply of cattle in the week ended January.2nd, but a compensating increase in the. supply of sheep. On the other hand, as shown above, the sales of cattle and sheep up to Christmas were excessively large. \ :,: ,A 4In the following table the imports in the fortnight ending January 5th are compared with those in the previous fortnight..

In the margarine sales are included 55 tons requisitioned by Local Food Committees. &apos;  The corresponding returns from co-operative societies have not yet been received.-i;o/ a Stocks.The stocks on January 1st, 1918, in the case of cereals partly produced at home should be considered in relation to the gradual use both of the home harvest and the stock generally. The following table shows a comparison of this and the preceding-harvest years.Reduction of Stock.	Wheat.

The estimate of the stocks of other cereals on January 1st, is not verified by actual stock-taking on the farms, as on December 1st, and contains, therefore, an element of uncertainty ; allowance being made for this, it is still clear that there has been a considerable saving in other cereals which tends to compensate the rapid use of wheat. .......The stock of maize has increased in December, but on January 1st, 1918, was only 21: per cent, of the stock on January 1st, 1917.When all cereals, including rice and meals, are taken together it is found that the stocks were: September 1, 1916 - 7,245,000 September 1, 1917 - 8,501,000 December 1, 1916 - 5,456,000 December 1, 1917 - 6,573,000 January 1, 1917 -   4,357,000     January 1, 1918 -  5,910,000The position as to cereals, taken together, still remains more favourable than it was a year ago, despite the rapid fall in wheat stocks.The aggregate stock of meat of all kinds on January 1st, was 102,000 tons as compared with 105,200 tons a month ago, and with-89,600 tons a year ago.. The stocks of butter, margarine and lard are unusually low. Of sugar the stock is nearly equal to that of last month and far above that of January 1st, 1917. That of tea is the same as last month.Prices.Retail prices (Table H) have increased slightly, but generally, during December. The prices of tea and of potatoes have fallen, while those of flour, bread, and cheese remained unchanged ; all other prices have risen by small percentages.-i.: Provisions.---Returns received- from the principal multiple shops as-&quot;to-the sales of provisions may be summarised as follows ;: &apos;
If we take July, 1917, as our starting-point and the average consumption of commodities in the autumn of 1917 as the basis, the following are the index numbers ofgeneral food prices :  $July 1, 1917 -     - - - - - - - 100September 1, 1917 - - - - - - - 98&apos;October 1, 1917    - - - - - - - -91 .November 1, 1917 - - - - - - 94December 1, 1917 - - - - - - 93January 1, 1918    - - - - - - - 93^Of the prices shown in Table K, those of peas, sago, tapioca and condensed milk have risen, but these increases are completely compensated by a reduction in the price of oatmeal.The wholesale price of imported wheat has risen 2s.
