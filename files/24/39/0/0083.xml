PARTY ADMINISTRATIONThe Party and the Coalition Government.(1) &quot;That this Conference is of the opinion that it is contrary to the interests of the working-classes for Labour Members of Parliament to remain members o. the Coalition Government.&quot;Manchester and Salford Labour Party.(2) &quot;That this Conference is of opinion that the continued inclusion of representa-tives of the Labour Party in the Coalition Government is a violation of the Constitution of the Party and is seriously detrimental to the best interests of Labour, and declares that in order to regain for Labour the freedom of complete in-dependence when dealing with the grave economic, industrial and social problems which must inevitably be dealt with in the near future, the Parliamentary Labour Party should at once take the necessary steps to withdraw from the Coalition Government, and that all offices held by Labour Party Members in the same be relinquished.&quot;Lambeth Trades Council and Labour Representation Committee.(3) &quot;This Conference of the Labour Party declares that the participation of Labour in the Government has not resulted in any tangible benefit to the people. It has not prevented the loss to Labour of its rights and liberties, but on the contrary has hampered the working class in resisting the growth of greater power in the hands of the capitalist and governing class. Neither has the association of the Labour Party with the Government assured that the coming Peace will be made by the democracy rather than by capitalist diplomacy&quot;Moreover, this Conference holds that the methods employed to remove Mr. Henderson from the War Cabinet when acting in perfect accord with the decisions of the Labour Party, prove that participation in the Government and fidelity to the Labour Movement are incompatible.&quot;This Conference, therefore, in the light of these facts, withdraws from the Govern-ment those members of the Party now holding office.&quot;British Socialist Party.(4) &quot;This Conference demands that all members of the Labour Party resign their Ministerial Offices under the present Government.&quot;Willesden Labour Party.(5) &quot;Seeing that the chief political function of the working class is the destruction of the ruling capitalist order, this Conference affirms that no Member of the Labour Party shall accept any position in any Government representative of the capitalist parties.&quot;Sheffield Trades and Labour Council.(6) &quot;That in view of the continued barefaced robbery of the people by the food pirates and the open support given by the Government to this action in steadfastly refusing to suppress the robbers and to administer the whole Food Supply of the nation in the interest of the people, this Conference calls upon the Labour Ministers to resign from the Government at once and constitute themselves into a vigorous Opposition Party, fighting profiteering and al! forms of robbery of the people, as well as for a restoration of liberty of speech, freedom of the Press and of publie meeting.&quot;In the event of any members of the Labour Party still continuing to accept oilier in cthe Government, this Conference demands their immediate expulsion from the Party  and public repudiation of their actions.&quot;East Ham Trades and Labour Council.
(7) &quot;Considering that the continued inclusion of members of the Parliamentary Labour Party in the so-called Coalition Government is seriously detrimental alike to the Industrial and Political interests of Labour, this Conference requests the present Labour Ministers to resign their positions in the Government; and declares that the time is now opportune for the embodiment in the Constitution of the Party 0f a clause to the effect that no member of the Party should accept office in any Government unless by the express authority of a specially convened Conference of the Party.&quot; Edinburgh Labour Party.Amendment.     -  -Line 4; Delete all &quot;after &quot;Government.&quot;Scientific Instrument Makers&apos; Trade Society.(8) &quot;This Conference declares that the will of the people could be best interpreted by a Government elected by the votes of the Members of the House of Commons and I calls upon the Parliamentary Labour Party to press for this Constitutional Reform.&quot;Edinburgh Labour Party.(9) &quot;This Conference declares that the time has now come when the members I of the Party should withdraw from the Government.&quot;Glasgow Trades Council.The Executive Committee and the Government.&quot;This Labour Party Conference declares that it is irregular and inadvisable that any member of the Executive Committee should retain his official connection with the Party upon the acceptance of an official position with the Government.&quot;National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union.Amendment.Line 1: Delete &quot;irregular and.&quot; The Workers. Union.The Executive Committee and Parliamentary Candidatures.&quot;That it be an instruction to the Executive Committee of the Labour Party, that in all,cases of a refusal to sanction a Parliamentary Candidature, a full statement of the reasons for such refusal be made to the local Labour Party concerned.&quot; Merthyr Boroughs Labour Party.Norwich Bye-Election.(1) &quot;That this Conference emphatically protests against the policy of the Executive, re the Norwich Bye-Election.&quot;Huddersfield and District Associated Trades and Labour Council.(2) &quot;That this Conference protests against the action of the Executive in support-ing the Candidature of Mr. G. H. Roberts, at the recent bye-eleotion at Norwich, which in our mind is a direct violation of the Constitution of the Labour Party, and urges that necessary steps be taken to prevent Mr. Roberts having membership of the Parliamentary Labour Party.&quot;Gt. Yarmouth and District Trades and Labour Council.Voting at Party Conferences.(1) &quot;That this Conference, believing that the present method of Unions voting on the Block System, is not sufficiently democratic, and does not give a true in-dication of the feeling^ of the members upon important questions, instructs the Executive Committee to consider the whole question and submit proposals to the next Annual Conference.&quot; Tyneside Labour Representation Committee.(2) &quot;That the Block System of voting shall be substituted by a system in which the votes of Minorities shall be recorded as well as Majorities and shall count in value in proportion to their number.&quot; Hucknall Labour Party.
Propaganda and Organisation,&quot;That in view of the creation of new Parliamentary Divisions, and the alteration in area of many other Divisions, the Executive Committee be instructed to prepare a scheme of propaganda and organisation in alF those constituencies where the general Trades Union and Socialist organisation warrants the effort. That Organisers be appointed from the Head Office to visit.such constituencies for the purpose of organising and strengthening existing political organisations, and to form such organisations where none exist at present; and that Local Labour Parties be encouraged and financially assisted to conduct propaganda and organising campaigns in neighbouring constituencies.&quot;Derby Trades Council and Labour Party Joint Committee.Amendment. Line 4: Delete &quot;the general.&quot;The Workers&apos; Union.Agents&apos; Conferences.&quot;That it be an instruction to the Executive Committee of the Labour Party to make arrangements for periodical Conferences of the Labour Party Agents.&quot;Wolverhampton Trades and Labour Council.Welsh Advisory Council.&quot;That this Conference is of the opinion that in order to co-ordinate the Political Labour Movement in Wales, and also to carry on Political Propaganda in out-lying districts, the time has come for the establishment in Wales of an Advisory Council on the same lines as that established in Scotland.&quot;West Monmouthshire Labour Party. County of Pembroke Labour Party. Merthyr Boroughs Labour Party. Cardiff Trades and Labour Council.Rhondda Labour Party. East Glamorgan Labour Party.The Parliamentary Party.(1) &quot;This Conference expresses its emphatic condemnation of the Parliamentary Labour Party for its inactivity against the capitalist food thieves and profiteers.&quot;East Ham Trades and Labour Council.(2) &quot;This Conference condemns the action of Messrs. Barnes, Brace, Hodge, Parker, and Roberts, in voting against the Party&apos;s amendment to the Corn Production Bill, moved by Mr. G. J. Wardle, M.P., fixing the minimum wage for agricultural labourers at 30s. per week.&quot; Manchester and Salford Labour Party.Overlapping.&quot;That this Conference views with serious apprehension the multiplicity of new national organisations which attempts to deal with Labour politics, also the repeated calling of Conferences by such bodies thus tending to divert the strength of the permanent Labour organisations and to create divisions in their ranks. This Conference therefore, in the interests of the unity of the National Labour Party, advises all its affiliated Societies to refrain from co-operating with any political or semi-political movements or organisations unless the same have been endorsed by the Party in Conference assembled or by the National Executive.&quot;Railway Clerks&apos; Association.
GENERAL RESOLUTIONSPeace.(1) &quot;That in the opinion of this. Conference the War marks the breakdown of t(,e old method of diplomacy which settled the international relations of the peoples ifithout consulting, or even informing, them ; it declares that in the past the failure das not been with soldiers, but with statesmen, who have used victories to impose [ernis of peace which left suspicion, hate, and resentment behind, which were followed by military alliances and armaments, and which violated the principles of self-government in order to satisfy military demands and imperialist appetites; it therefore calls upon the Government, if the sacrifices of the War have not been in vain, to provide for the direct representation of the organised democracy in every Conference which discusses the condition of Peace, tci reject war aims which gives tde War the character of an imperialist venture, and to use its influence and authority in, every possible way to remove the causes of war ; to this end, the Con-[erence declares that no obstacle should be put in the way of responsible representa-tives of Labour conferring together with a view to arriving at such an understanding upon the problems of Europe, as will receive the co-operative support of all the democracies, without which there can be no lasting Peace.&quot;Independent Labour Party.(2) &quot;This Conference of the Labour Party cannot fail to observe that during recent months those forces which, in all belligerent countries, resist the political and economic progress of the working class, have consolidated their opposition to a Peace settlement to be made by the peoples and in accordance with democratic demands. Maintaining that the durability of the Peace will depend upon the extent of the peoples&apos; participation in the settlement, this Conference instructs the Executive Committee to use its utmost power, in conjunction with the International Socialist Bureau, to secure an immediate conference of representatives of Labour and Socialist organisations from all belligerent and neutral countries, under conditions that provide for the free consideration of the essentials of a just Peace without in-demnities or annexations and ensuring the rights of nations to determine how and by whom they will be governed.&quot;British Socialist Party.(3) &quot;That this Conference, believing that the continuance of this War can only bring further disaster to the workers of the world, and to the countries involved, demands that the Government shall publicly use all its efforts and influence with ihe Allies and the Central Powers to bring it to an end by negotiation.&quot;Bristol Labour Representation Committee. Amendment.Line 4: Delete &quot;by negotiation&quot; and insert &quot;and shall accept the proposal of the Russian Government for an armistice to negotiate, a peoples&apos; Peace on the basis of &apos;no annexations, no indemnities, the right of the peoples to decide their own destinies.&apos; &quot;Ealing, Acton and Chiswick Trades and Labour Council,
(4) &quot;This Conference views with very grave alarm the appalling sacrifice of life and treasure in this terrible European War, and requests the Labour Partv to take such steps as may seem advisable to bring about Peace by Negotiation.&quot;Norwich Trades Council and Labour Representation Committee. AMENDMENT.Line 2: Delete all words after &quot;War,&quot; and insert &quot;but nevertheless recognising that the conflict at present being waged against the allied autocracies of Central and Eastern Europe is one in defence of civilisa-tion, liberty, and the rights of the smaller nationalities, reaffirms the declaration of Mr. Asquith when Prime Minister, &apos;That we shall never sheathe the sword until Belgium has recovered all, and more than all, that she has sacrificed ; until France is adequately secured against the menace of aggression ; until the rights of the smaller nationalities&apos; of Europe are placed upon an unassailable foundation, and until the military domination of Prussia is wholly and finally destroyed.&apos; &quot;National Union of Dock Labourers, &amp;c.(5) &quot;That this Conference resolves that the members of the so-called Pacifist Party, shall be given to understand that they are not to have any voice in the setting up of Peace Terms beyond their representative strength.&quot;Chesterfield Trades Council.(6) That in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable when representatives of belligerent nations meet to discuss Peace Terms, that a Conference of all sections of the International should also be convened, in the same city and at the same time, to discuss the questions of settlement from the standpoint of the International work-ing class.&quot;Bristol Labour Representation Committee.(7) &quot;That in the opinion of this Conference, the time has now arrived when an effort should be made to bring about Peace by Negotiation.&quot;&quot; v *Leicester Labour Party.(8) &quot;That this Conference welcomes the publication of &apos;Labour&apos;s War Aims&quot;, and especially those sections which deal with the future and with the demand for the establishment of a League of Nations, the Limitation of Armaments ami International Control over World Supplies, but urges that there should be added to the proposals a demand for the Abolition of Conscription in all countries.&quot;Women&apos;s Labour League.(9) &quot;This Conference of the Labour Party declares that the War has demonstrated the inability of Capitalism to preserve Peace among the nations ; the prolongation of the War only seems to complicate the issues involved and render more remote the possibilities of Peace; and this Conference therefore declares that the best interests of the working class will be secured by a speedy termination of hostilities and demands of the Government that it declares its readiness to enter into immediate negotiations for Peace.&quot;York Labour Party.
(10) &quot;This Conference sees no early prospect of the War being ended by Military action alone, and in view of the incalculable suffering entailed by an indefinite prolongation of hostilities, declares that every political means to secure Peace should now be employed and to that end declares that it is essential to the promotion of a democratic Peace, that the accredited representatives of the Labour Movement of all countries should meet in conference at an early date.&quot;Glasgow Trades Council.Amendment.To add : &quot;and that such representatives should be elected by a ballot vote of the members of all organisations affiliated to the National Labour Party, and that for the purpose of electing such representatives the Executive Committee be instructed to arrange for suitable divisions of the country into divisional areas; each divisional area to elect its own representative. In the event of the Government refusing passports for such a Conference, the Executive Committee be instructed at once to call a National Conference for the purpose of formulating a policy which will compel the Government to give way.&quot;Lincoln Trades and Labour Council.(11) &quot;That the Labour Party use every endeavour to secure adequate representation on any Committee set up to negotiate regarding Peace.&quot;Gt. Yarmouth and District Trades and Labour Council.Amendment.&quot;That this Party, being of the opinion that a declaration of the War Aims of this Nation&apos;and its European Allies is imperative to secure a &apos;lasting Peace, which shall provide for all Nations the opportunity of living as neighbours to each other, freed from the burdens of Militarism and with a right of free economic development secured to every Nation. This Party therefore, calls upon the Government to immediately make such declaration, and further requests the Parliamentary Party to take steps to impress upon the Government the urgent need for this course. Further, they press for adequate Labour representation upon any Com-mittee who meet to discuss terms of settlement.&quot;Coventry Labour Party.Abolition of the: House of Lords.&quot;This Conference declares that&apos; the House of Commons shall be the supreme authority in all matters of national legislation and finance; and declares that a hereditary chamber such as the House of Lords should be abolished.&quot;This Conference instructs the Executive Of the Labour Party to take such action as will ensure the carrying out of the above named proposal.&quot;National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives.Amendments. (a) Line 1: Delete &quot;supreme.&quot;Glasgow Labour Party. -(b) Line 2: Delete all after &quot;finance&quot; to end.Glasgow Labour Party.(c) Line 3: After the word &quot;abolished&quot; insert &quot;and expresses its con-firmed opposition to any form of Second Chamber whether elected by the House of Commons or otherwise.&quot;     eEaling, Acton and Chiswick Trades and Labour Council.
Food Supplies and Profiteering.(1) &quot;That this Conference&apos;protests indignantly against the shameless profiteerin which has been permitted in many directions since the outbreak of war, and especially in. the food supplies of the people; it deplores and condemns the weak vacillating policy of the Government which would seem to have been directed largely toward conciliating the vested interests; and in view of the increasing shortage of manv commodities, the high prices which place them beyond reach of the poor, the upset and dislocation which will have economic consequences for years to come, and the grave danger of approaching world famine, this Conference declares that the Govern-ment in its handling of the food problem should have regard only to the public welfare, should establish the distribution of available supplies on a family basis of share and share alike, should eliminate completely the taint of profiteering, should take full advantage of the services of self-reliant agencies like the Co-operative Move-ment, and should insist upon a real equality in sacrifice between all classes.Independent Labour Party.Amendments(a) Line 5: Delete all after the word &quot;interests&quot; and insert: &quot;ami recognising that the exploitation of the poor is certain to continue so long as the making of private profit in food is allowed, calls upon the* Government, in conjunction with the local authorities, to take entirecontrol of the food supply, to take over the import of food, the farms food factories, bakeries, and distributive agencies, and, under some sucli system as that organised by the Belgian Relief Commission, engaging where possible those already employed in the food industries to do the work at adequate salaries as servants of the nation, without any power to make private profit out of the food supply, and further to cope with the present food shortage by establishing the distribution of available-food supplies on a family basis of share and share alike without regard to the financial position of the families.&quot;Baling, Acton and Chiswick Trades and Labour Council. Amendment.(b) &quot;That this Conference, having seriously considered the question of food stuffs, requests the Parliamentary. Labour Party to urge upon the Government the necessity of rationing the whole nation.&quot;The Workers&apos; Union.(2) &quot;That in view of the scarcity of food supplies from other countries and the continued tendency of home traders to impose extortionate prices, this Conference-calls upon the Government to take more complete control of Food Supplies and their distribution, and urges that every available acre of cultivable land shall be utilised by the Government for increasing Food Production. The Conference further declares its profound dissatisfaction at inadequate representation given to the Trade Union and Co-operative Movement on Local Food Control Committees.&quot;Glasgow Trades Council.Amendment. Line 3 : &quot;Delete the word &quot;more.&quot;Barrow Labour Party and Trades Council.\
