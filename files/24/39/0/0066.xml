Have returned from Ekaterinedar where I saw the Vice-President of the Federation unfortunately (?) Kharlamoff had just left for a holiday at home on the Don. This is typical of the leisurely prooedure of the heads of this movement. The Kuban territory was always the best producing region here about and even now wheat is undoubtedly very plentiful but it is ? still held back on the (l group undecipherable) the station depositories being empty. The Kuban Authorities aver however that it would be easy te prooure wheat and sunflower oil in large quantities for Roumania: af oourse attempt must be made although I am practically certain that it will fail, besides which the authorities admit that actual shipment from Nevorssisk would probably be impossible. The Black Sea Government of which Neveressisk is the capital cuts off the Kuban territory from the sea; this Government is frankly Bolshevick and the federation officials complain that they cannot hope to reduce it for want of ammunition and on account of the attitude of the Black Sea Army. I am afraid however that no such action would in any case be possible on account of the dissatisfaction amongst Kuban Cossacks themselves who even in Ekaterinodar have been overawed by the presence of a Circassian Regiment. The Kuban Cossacks at the beginning of the war supplied the best troops of this (?group omitted) but for Decades past they have been the only ones that included regiments of infantry and it was this medium* that these particular Cossacks have unfortunately become more infected with Bolsheviek Propaganda than have the other all cavalry Cossacks.

On account of the railway having for some days been out by marauding tribes between Tiflis and Baou and also more recently at Gudermes Junction north of Baou the homeward flow of Russian troops from the Turkish front via Tiflis is now suspended, but a brisk repatriation is in progress from Trebizond by Black Sea ships to Novorossisk and thenoe by rail. The impression to be gathered in Ekaterinsdar is that the present spirit amongst Kuban Cossacks here is much less satisfactory that in the Doh and that matters are possibly just as bad in the Terek: all the leaders think that this can only be rectified by time, meanwhile they appear to place great reliance on the Circassian tribes of the Daghestan. At the moment these tribes are causing considerable trouble at .....sny and they are generally of an undisciplined nature: their political attitude however is good and it is claimed that useful units can be formed amongst them but time would be required for this also.   There is the same want of public spirit amongst refugee Russians in Ekaterinedar as elsewhere while the leaders there are behaving in a very leisurely way: they all seem to be simply waiting for a help from the outside and that more with the idea of securing ulterior benefits for their districts than for a prosecution of the war (1 group undecipherable) result steps were being taken in the direction of organizing the Government of the federation.

While I have been away Bolshevicks have made ? direct advances to the west of Don Headquarters whioh they have now out off from all Bituminous and most of Anthraoite.     In viev; of this and cf the other developments reported in Colonel Jaok&apos;s telegram 67 I am leaving for IJovooherkask where incidentally I expeot to meet French Intendant in oharge of Roumanian supplies. Jack is also enquiring into prospects of procuring fuel for Roumania whioh are most umpromising; such have been the disturbances in and around Caucasus petroleum fields that there is a shortage of oil even for the looal railways.
