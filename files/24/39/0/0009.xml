\:plon -Victoria 8240.Colonel *iones&quot;TilegPSms:-Gkowmore, Sowest, Lokdojt.lent.)BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.17To avoid delay, address all communications to :  She Director General.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)9th January, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of theFood Production Department for the week ended 8th January, 1918:-parts of the country.     In a few counties the frost was not sufficiently hard to prevent the plough working;   in Shropshire and Staffordshire, for instance, it is reported &quot;good progress was made everywhere.&quot;   In most districts, however, there was a considerable amount of frost and snow which brought ploughing, especially tractor operations, practically to a standstill.Department and representatives of the Army Council it was agreed that a scheme for increasing food production by the Armies in France which had been draan up by this Department should be&apos; discussed with the Army Authorities in France, and to that end Dr. Keeble, the Director of Horticulture, and a representative of the Army Council proceeded to France in order to lay the scheme before the Quarter-Mas-ter-General.     It was subsequently agreed that the whole of the cultivation to be carried out by the Armies in France, including both intensive cultivation in Army gardens and extensive cultivation in Army farms, should be put under the control of a Military Director of Agricultural Production who should be attached to the Quarter-Master-Genera35staff, and who should have at his. disposal a Headquarter staff comprising a Deputy Director and oneThe Weather.The weather last week varied considerably in differentFOOD PRODUCTION IN FRANCE.As the result of Conferences between the Food Production
or more Assistant Directors and a Staff Captain.      It was further agreed that one of the Head Quarter staff should be a Horticulturist with the duty of advising the Director on means for organising and extending Army gardens along the Lines of Communication. Army Farms,   The proposal with respect to Army Farms set forth in the scheme drafted by the Food Production Department (i0e. that 10 units each of about 5,000 acres should be cultivated) was agreed to,., and it was also agreed that the Army farm units should be lobated so far as possible in the barred zone, that is to say in the zone between the line drawn four miles from the front line, and that marking&apos; the limit beyond which French civilian population may not at present return.     A part of this zone was inspected by the Representative of this Department, and a large area of about 20,000 acres lying eastward of Peronne was found to be admirably adapted for the purpose of Army farms.     The ground thoiigh weedy is free from encumbrance of shell holes, wire and unexploded shells, and the soil in this region is a lightish loam overlying the chalk and is undoubtedly fertile.     The ground moreover appears to be admirably adapted to tractor cultivation,Negotiations have also been conducted in Paris with the French Ministry of Agriculture with respect to the tenure of the ground.     These negotiations are not yet concluded, but a series of suggestions have been made by the French Minister which the Army Council after consideration is prepared to adopt.     The Army Council is now in telegraphic communication with the French Government with the object of securing the ratification of these proposals.At subsequent Conferences in London between the Army Council, Lord Radnor, the Director of Agriculture appointed by the Army Council, and the Food Production Department it was agreed that the main crops which are grown in the Army farms shall be oats and potatoes.    It was also agreed that this Department should   SujLjL^
230 tractors,   with a nucleus of trained drivers to serve as instructors;    and should also provide other necessary agricultural implements not obtainable in France.    It was further agreed that the Department should supply 5,000 tons of seed potatoes, and that it should report upon the suitability of oats now held by the British Armies in France for seed purposes.Army Gardens.    Arrangements have already been made for the establishment of 4 Nurseries for the purpose of supplying trans-plantable seedlings, onions, leek, cabbage, savoy, &amp;c, to the Army gardens.    One of these establishments which are being organised by the French for the benefit of the British Armies, was inspected. Thi Nursery is on the outskirts of Arras and consists of 5 acres of well Y/atered and thoroughly prepared ground admirably adapted for the purpose of raising seedlings.   The French Officer in charge was enthusiastically devoted to his work and agreed that it would be quite practicable both to extend his Seedling Nursery and to add to it a Market Garden in which etny surplus plants not required for distribution could be cultivated.   With a small amount of labour it would be possible for him to make a large contribution to vegetable food supply.In all the arrangement for increasing the production of food by the British Armies there is the closest agreement and co-operation between this Department, the War Office and the Military Authorities in France.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Bedfordshire.   The Committee were already in possession of 30 acres of a farm at Tdbworth, the cultivation of which had been neglected by the owner-occupier and they have now found it necessary to take possession of the whole of the farm (74 acres).. Suffolk, West.    The Committee have taken possession of 56 acres
of land owned by the Hepworth Charity Trustees and let in small plots to various tenants.   Most of these plots are said to be in a disgraceful condition, but those few holders who are cultivating well will be retained as tenants df the Committee.   They have also been authorised to take possession of a farm of 178 acres at Whatfield said to be in a deplorable condition and to have been chiefly staffed.by farm pupils.Worcestershire.   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 106 acres of land at Ombersley owned and occupied by Lord Sandys.   This area consists entirely of arable fields and fruit plantations and is aaid to be some of the finest land in the county, but has been hopelessly neglected.   Proceedings are being instituted against Lord Sandys for neglecting to comply with orders to clean this land.Yorkshire, East Riding.   The Committee are about to take possession of derelict arable fields extending to 45 acres and forming part of the Hedon Race Course.Golf Courses.   In Kent the Committee are taking possession of and letting 29 acres of the course at Herne Bay.   In Surrey possession is to be taken by the Committee of 50 acres of the Bleak Down Course at Byfleet;   in view of possible claims for compensation it has been arranged to exclude most of the greens and bunkers.   In both cases the land will be let to tenants for cultivation.Drainage of Land.   In Kesteven the Pike Drain which drains a substantial area at the north of the county has been cleansed, and a weir which obstructed it removed by the owners at the suggestion of the Executive Committee without resort to compulsion. Determination of Tenancies.     During the week, 4 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 426 acres.
Provision of Land for Allotments.   Reports received by the Department show that in 1,102 districts 210,946   applications  have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, and 191,485 plots have been provided containing a total area of 14,006 acreseWhile there are no complete statistics as to the increase which has been effected in the number of allotments, throughout the country, striking evidence is received from time to time as to particular localities.    In the Borough of Luton, for example, there were before the war 126 acres of permanent allotments let to about 1,000 cultivators.     Since the outbreak of war 553 plots containing 37 acres have been provided for temporary cultivation, and no fewer than 952, containing 93 acres, for permanent allotments.     Out of a population which in 1911 numbered 50,000,  2^,500  persons are now provided with allotments.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Allotments Section.     The County Borough of Sunderland is acquiring the 40 acres of ground as recently recommended by the Department, and they propose to create on this ground 560 allotments.At Southwick-on-?/ear 7 acres, to be divided into 100 plots, have been acquired.As the result of visits to Coventry, 350 new allotmentshave been provided (25 acres).     New allotments have also beenprovided in other places as follows:-Hammersmith   140 allotments (10 rods each).Maidenhead    120 plots ( 8 acres -each ). figton               5 acresCarlisle 90 allotments ( 6 acres).Kingston-6n-Thames     168 allotments (12 acres).Basket Making,     As the result of a conference, the Kent
Growers are prepared to start the basket making factory, and the West Kent Womens1 War Agricultural Committee will undertake the establishment of training centres in Kent villages.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection of Land.   Harewood Downs Gdlf Course, in Buckinghamshire has been inspected by an officer of the Division.     The trustees responsible for the property have offered to break up all the land which could be cultivated without interfering with the play, and in view of the fact that the uneven nature of the course would render the cultivation of the v/hole area a laborious and expensive matter, the inspector considers that this offer should be accepted. Failure of Winter Wheat.   An interim report has been submitted with regard to the failure of winter wheat in the Wadebridge District of Cornwall, referred to in last week&apos;s report.     It appears that winter wheat has been attacked in the district during the last five years, but not until the present season have the attacks become so general as to attract serious attention.     Of the twenty fields visited on the 21st and 22nd ultimo eight fields of wheat have beeh practically destroyed, five badly injured, and four show evident signs of attack.     One field of wheat destroyed in November has been re-sown, and the resulting plant again almost ruined, In the past the injury has often been attributed to rabbits, but for various reasons this is considered improbable.     No insect pest is likely to have produced the special form of injury, with the possible exception of cut-worms, but the previous treatment of many of the fields attacked practically excludes this possibility, and the most likely pests responsible for the injury are slugs. Unfortunately, owing to severe frosts, the soil was frozen to a depth of six inches at the time of the Inspectorrs visit, and soil pests were not therefore in evidence.   It will not be possible absolutely to
identify the pest until weather conditions ere more favourable, but in the meantime the immediate re-sowing with wheat of badly damaged fields is not advised.     Spring barley and oats have never been attacked, and can, so far as is knoY?n* be sown without risk.Seed Testing Station.     The number of samples received during the week is 381, and reports have been issued in respect of 200. Additional temporary expert assistance has been secured in order to cope with the very large number of samples received during the past few weeks.     Nearly 500 tests are at present being conducted.LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier Labour.     During the week, 82 additional ploughmen have arrived from overseas on two months&apos; agricultural furlough, bringing the total number of these men made available to date up to 1,368.     The number of these men sent out in charge of Government horses is 152, and 1,105 are with farmers on ploughing work.     Any men remaining in Depots are being moved to counties where they can be Immediately employed.   Enquiries are already being received from Agricultural Executive Committees as to whether the leave of these men will be extended, and it Is represented that in view of the shortage of ploughmen it is most important that the men should remain for a further period.Exclusive of the men above mentioned, 52,212 soldiers have been attached to Depots to date for the 1918 programme, of whom 21,683 are so-called &quot;skilled&quot; men, and 10,529 unskilled. Of these men, 19,674 and 7,104 respectively are out on farms. Of the men remaining In Depots the majority are on the staff or under training either as horse ploughmen or for tractor work, and as regards the balance of men available, Committees have been urged to get them placed out for work such as hedging, ditching etc.An additional 127 men have been sent out for training
as tractor drivers during the week, making a total to date of .2,152 men.Horses.   Orders for the issue of 282 additional horses have been sent out during the week, making a total of 4,818 horses to date.In view of the additional supplies of horses required to work with the prisoner ploughmen arriving from Prance, the War Office have agreed to supply at once,2,800 horses on sale to this Department, and in addition they are prepared to lend 12,000 horses not immediately required for military purposes. Prisoners of War.    Only 12 additional prisoners of war were employed in agriculture during the week, these being added to one of the existing camps, bringing the total number of prisoners of war now engaged on work connected with food production up to 5,946.     A large number of schemes for the employment of prisoner ploughmen have now been sent to the war Office, but so far no information has been received as to which of these premises are considered suitable.Women1s Branch.Efforts are being made all over the country to estimate the probable demand for women&apos;s seasonal labour in the coming spring, as it is felt to be most important that adequate preparation should be made for possible sudden demands.The Group Leaders appointed in various counties are proving of great use in this connection.   They are visiting outlying districts and urging farmers to employ women, and are also impressing upon the local village women the great necessity for them to come out and give still further help in agricultural work.-A most successful ploughing demonstration has recently been held in the West Riding of Yorkshire.   The work of the women who entered was highly commended by the large number of farmers present, and it is hoped that the Demonstration may stimulate the demand for women labour in the county.
The number of women accounted for as members of the Land Army up to the present time is 7,029--In Instruction Centres............. 198On Farm Work . *..................... 5,778Employed by the Forage Department .. 485 Employed by the TimberSupply Department.................. 170Waiting to be placed inTraining Centres................... 75Waiting for.employment in depots  ... 67Waiting in their own homes  ......... 2567,029Women&apos;s Institutes. Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Nottingham and Shropshire have started the New Year with meetings to discuss the desirability of promoting the Women&apos;s Institute movement, and the formation of several new Institutes are reported.   So many applications are being made for Institute organisers that it is impossible to make arrangements to send speakers without long notice. The village people are realising that Institutes are a real need, and great interest Is being taken in them all over the country.&quot;MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shows the position as regards the provision of tractors owned by the Department:-Consigned to Agricultural Executive Committeesup to and including 1st January .............. 1,909Consigning instructions given during the week .. 36On offer to counties........................... 35Consigned to Scotland     127&quot;          &quot;   Ireland        82 2072,137Between 15th and 23rd November inclusive (Sunday omitted) an Overtime tractor, working in Gloucestershire, ploughed 41 acres in 80 hours.     This includes time taken for adjustments, replacements and meals.     The signatures testifying to the correctness of these figures have been   obtained from the farmers for whom the work was done.
The Tractor Representative for Wiltshire reports that a unit of 7 Titan tractors ploughed 117 acres on an average of 4 gallons 2 pints per acre.     Considering the character of the land ploughed, this is reported to be a record for low paraffin consumption.     Another unit of 15 Titans ploughed 297^ acres, averaging 20 acres per tractor per week, at a consumption of 4 gallons paraffin1 per acre.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Superphosphate.   The imports of phosphate rock imported on Government account in the five months August to December 1917, were 145,626 tons, or an average of 29,000 tons a month, as against the 50,000 tons a month which the Cabinet decided should be imported,     In addition 45,000 tons were on passage at the end of December and charters had been arranged for an additional 51,000 tons,   These figures are exclusive of certain quantities which were imported on private account, and when these are taken into account the total importation for the seven months of the present season (June - December 1917) amounts to 234,000 tons, or an average of 33,400 tons per month,,    It is important that the imports during the next three months should be kept up, otherwise the shortage of superphosphate consequent on the reduced importation of phosphate rock cannot fail to have a serious effect on food production this year.A conference has been held between the Scottish Super-phosphate Makers and the official representatives of the Phosphates and Potash Distribution Committee, with a view to meeting the needs of Scottish buyers as far as possible from stocks manufactured in Scotland, and thus avoiding unnecessary railway transport. Potash, The factory for the production of potash from flue dust which is being erected with Government assistance, is not yet working, though It is hoped that a start will be made, at any rate experimentally, by the end of this month.     The prospects of obtaining any serious supply of potash from this source during the present season are poor.
In order to meet the needs of the flax crop it was arranged that such quantities of high grade flue dust as could be obtained would be handed over to the Irish Department of Agriculture.     The quantity of such flue dust on offer is however small, and unless some definite action is taken with a view to supplies being purchased direct from the Blast Furnace Owners on behalf of the Government there is not very much prospect of any substantial quantities being obtained.     The Department is in communication with the Irish Department of Agriculture on the subject.A conference has been held with several firms engaged in the Fertiliser Trade, as to the deposits of potash in Abyssinnia, and the matter hvs been discussed with a representative of the Italian Company owning the deposits.   A proposal has been put -forward for consideration by the persons concerned, that an English Purchasing Company should be formed which would under-take to buy Potash from Abyssinnia over a period of ten years. Binder Twine.   A contract has been made by the Ministry of Munitions with the International Harvester Company of Great Britain, for the importation of 6,000 tons of binder twine from the United States and its sale on the same terms as the binder twine made by English manufacturers.Fencing Wire.     No complaints have been received recently as regards inability to obtain fencing wire or wire netting.     It is understood an allocation of 150 tons of steel per month for wire netting was made during October, November and December, and as the manufacturers have not made application for supplies for January, it is assumed that they still have quantities in stock. The importance of providing for a sufficient supply of plain fencing wire and wire netting during the coming months has been represented to the Ministry of Munitions,, with a view to sufficient netting&apos; and wire being made to meet requirements, in the Spring.
Seed Wheat.    It Is hoped that the shipment of seed wheat to Prance will be completed by the end of next week.Seed Oats. (1) Manx Oats,The first cargoes of oats from the Isle of Fan have been inspected at Liverpool) and one rarcel was found to be absolutely unsuitable for seed purposes. Of the other two parcels one was quite a good sample and the other will be held in reserve and only used in case of absolute necessity. Further shipments are advised this week, and It is hoped that the Department will be in a position to issue samples and make deliveries next week.(2)    Irish Oats. The arrangements for the purchase of oats in Ireland are now completed, and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction have consented to undertake the inspection and selection of parcels suitable for seed.     The fact that the prohibition of export from Ireland on private account has not yet been enforced is leading to very large exports at the present time. It is important that the prohibition should be introduced as soon as possible.(3)   Scotch Oats. It has been decided that, if the Board of Agriculture for Scotland concur, a prohibition on the export of oats from Scotland on private account should be enforced, and the Department are conducting negotiations with the Scottish Board regarding the methods to be followed in securing supplies of seed for English farmers.Seed Potatoes. During the week ended 5th January orders for 2,363 tons of seed potatoes were issued by the Section, of which about 1,700 tons were for Scotch seed.     The total amount of deliveries reported In that week was 96 tons 12 cwt.   Orders are being dispatched as quickly as possible and every effort Is being made to hasten delivery, but the weather conditions so far during the New Year have been adverse to the loading of potatoes.-12-
As a result of the Press Notice issued by the Ministry of Food regarding the guaranteed price for potatoes in 1918, and also as a result of the intimation that the Ministry of Food were prepared to enter into contracts in certain counties for the growth of &quot;second earlies&quot; on acreage in excess of that under potatoes on the farm or holding 1917, there have been a number of enquiries regarding the supply.of &quot;seed1 of second early varieties.   The Department still hold considerable stocks of these varieties, and if necessary the supply can be supplemented.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.I&quot; stem
