fiIS DOCUMEKT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS&quot; BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.)31S 1 CHIT.-  WAR CaxjINET.^6                      OATS FOR ITALY. G.T. --337Z---Memo: by Sir E* Wyldbore Smith.With reference to Minute No. 18 of the meeting of the War Cabinet held on the 14th November last (No. 273). on the subject of the supply of Oats to the Italian Army, it was arranged by the Ministry of Shipping with the War Office, in accordance with the decision taken at that meeting, to divert -to Italy three ships due in December carrying approximately 17,000 tons of Oats; while a further two cargoes of approx-imately 12,000 tons were transferred to Itaiy by.the French Government.     The position was thereby temporarily alleviated and, as will be seen from the statement attached, the arrivals of Military Oats in Italy for the last quarter of 1917 amount-ed to 71$ of their requirements.Fgr the first quarter of this year, however, and parti-cularly for the months of January and February, the situation has again become acute*     I attach a statement showing the estimated arrivals (military) during January, February and March, amounting to  0,303 tons, 15*171 tons and 41,850 tons respectively;   ine monthly requirements of the Italian Army, based on a very low ration, being 60,000 tone.It is understood from the Italian Delegation that endeavours are being made to obtain tonnage from America, but even if these efforts are successful, their effect will not be felt for some time to come, and in the meantime, the Italian Government are obliged to look to their European Allies for assistance      They accordingly request that in view of the extremely serious situation that threatens to arise in Italy in February, it may be found possible to afford them Immediate and substantial relief by the diversion to Italy of some prompt oats, cargoes already en route to France and this country.That this request is by no means unreasonable will be evident from the following figures, taken from returns issued by the Wheat Executive-,, showing the estimated deficiency in supplies of oats and oats substitutes (military and civilian) in the three countries^ named in January and February, 1918 :-United Kingdom.. France. Italy.January. 6.6, 5.8 51.9February 10.6 (excess) 3,7 54.5
In the case of France and Italy home-grown oats supplies are taken into account in arriving at the above percentages, but a3 regards the United Kingdom the figures relate only to importation requirements.It will be observed that the estimated arrivals in the United Kingdom in February exceed the importation requirements by 10-6 per cent,  representing about 20,000 tons.   In view of this, I would suggest for the considera-tion of the War Cabinet that some floating cargoes of oats en route to this country should be diverted to Italy and that representations should be made to the French Govern-ment with a view to their taking similar action.   I under-stand that the &quot;Kheat Executive are considering the allocation of 2 3teamers for prompt loading in the Gulf, but I fear that even if immediately allocated they could not arrive before March, while this assistance by itself would be insufficient.(Sgd.)
