Received 1.6 p.m. 14th January, 1918*1M.1.1.11552&apos; jl %J \s30From General Barter, Petrograd.To CI.G.3.1420.   January 12th.Yesterday I had confidential information that the Peace negotiations were about to be broken off and that staff with Krilenko were considering measures for the improvment cf the Army and for defence.     General Bonchbruevich asked me this afternoon to go and see him; he said it was practically certain that there would be no Peace. I asked what Krilenko had said on the subject and he replied that he was of this opinion.     Germans were making impossible conditions including payment of an idemnity in the form of war material; they were in fact acting as conquerers and dictating terms which the Government could not tolerate.The Russian delegates I am informed have been instructed to prolong negotiations as long as possible in order to gain time to make military dispositions to meet the new situation.     These dispositions include formation of a Volunteer Army on strictly revolutionary lines with revolutionary discipline which means none at all.     An order will be sent to all committees telling them to proceed immediately witfe the formation of this revolutionary Guard; only volunteers are to be accepted.     It is certain that this new appeal will result in the further denudation of the frontsA friendly Bolshevist brought me last night a which had been compiled by Krilenko which will be givenfor transmission.in a few days timecopy of order to the StaffRussian Troops leave Rumania.on the Rumanian frontthis order and ordersis addressed to them immediatelytoAny interference by Rumania is to be dealt with by force; supplies are to be requisitioned and paid for by committee, receipts.I cannot telegraph this information immediat ely to Jassy as cipher telegrams from Stavka are now forbidden, but have sent a copy of order to 1 of our officers .at Kiev for transmission to Geserai Bailard or French Mission.     General Bonchbruevich did not think Germans would attempt any offensive operations before the spring except possibly attack in direction from the west to the north front to out that the Russian Army could not essential the reach orders., effort into agree with thisof Revel.     He had ordered troops meet this possibility.     I pointed offer r b si stance and that the tiling was to get all possible stores and war material out of cf the Germans; he promised that he would issued the necessary He thinks that Russians may possibly be able to make some the spring if a new Government comes in.   . It is difficultThe
The above is the gist of a letter from Colonel Edwards at Stavka.    I may add that 3 weeks ago Roumanian military repro-sentative informed me the Ukraine troops 7rould shortly have ? replaced the other Russian troops on the Roumanian front.    I am however informing the Roumanian Legation here immediately.   You may consider it is desirable to warn Roumania by wireless also. Failure to secure Peace and issue of the instructions given above may do much to hasten downfall of present Government.   Once some sort of Coalition Government is formed much may be done towards the construction of new Army of Poles if they are well supported by .Allies by a Voluntary Army with Staffs composed Of Allied Officers by Ukraine and.by Don.;&apos;*C .
