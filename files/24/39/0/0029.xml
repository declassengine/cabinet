BOLSHEVIST PROPAGANDAReferring to Minute (l) of the War Cabinet held on the 11th instant, so far as it refers to the publication in the &quot;Herald&quot; of the proclamation of M. Litvinoff, I    e think that by publishing this proclamation the &quot;Herald&quot; rendered itself liable to prosecution or seirure.     The concluding passages of the proclamation, of which a co^y is annexed (marked A), would alone be sufficient for this purpose.The same issue of the &quot;Herald&quot; also contained a copy of the manifesto by Trotsky addressed to &quot;all the peoples and governments of the Allied Countries&quot;. This proclamation was cabled to this country on the 29th December; and although the first part of it, which appeared to be a complete telegram by itself and was comparatively harmless, was passed for publication, the cable as a whole was stopped by the Press Bureau by the direction of the War Cabinet.     It appears that the manifesto in a complete form has reached M, Litvinoff and has been given by him to the Socialist Press.     The character of this manifesto is illustrated by the annexedtextracts marked B.     The publication of this document also appears to me to render the wHerald&quot; open to prosecution or seizure.But there are considerable difficulties in the way of seizure or prosecution. Litvinoff&apos;s proclamation has been published, not only in the &quot;Herald&quot;, but also (with oertain excisions) in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot;, the &quot;Call&quot;, and the &quot;V/orkers 1 Dreadnought&quot; ; and parts of it have appeared in the &quot;VJestminster Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot;.    Trotsky&apos;s manifesto has also appeared in some of these newspapers. It would not be possible to seize the &quot;Herald&quot; without treating the other newspapers in the same way; and this would be a very serious business.    Further, it appears that Litvinoff has been welcomed by Mr.- Arthur Henderson, M.P. as a representative of the Russian democracy; and it seems probable that he will be received by the Labour Conference on the 23rd instant.     Mr. Wilson&apos;s reference to the Russian democracy also makes it difficult to treat the Bolshevists as enemies of &quot;this Country-I agree with Mr. Barnes and Lord Robert Cecil that it is undesirable, to seize or prosecute the &quot;Herald&quot; in respeot of this number.But it is necessary to define the course which should be taken in the future. The Bolshevist propaganda, if. not checked, may spread very rapidly and may have a serious effect upon morale in this Countrys it may algo cause trouble among munition workers and,even in the Army.     I do not think that   .. Litvinoff should be allowed on the ground that he c3.aims to be agent of the Bolshevist &quot;Government&quot;, to do that which no accredited ambassador and no alien in a private position would be allowed to do, viz. - to promote disaffection and strife in this country with a view to inter-fering with the prosecution of the war,1 should therefore like to have the directions of the War Cabinet on the questions - (l) whether a check should be put   upon M.    Litvinoff&apos;s correspondence, and whether he should be warned that if he pursues his propaganda it may be impossible to permit him to remain in this country; (2j) whether any newspaper publishing further propaganda of the same nature should be vigorously dealt with by way.of seizure or prosecution; or (S) whether the      Government prefers to rely on counter-propaganda.2th January, 1918.G. CAVE.
EXTRACTS FROM &quot;THE HERALD&quot; OF THE 12th JANUARY,1918.A.The Russian Revolution, with its dash and vigour, has become the focus of the hatred of international capitalism, and now the prolongation of the war, in addition to its former imperialistic aims, has another aim - to crush the Soviets and the Revolution.     And so the Russian workers are not only fighting their own battles, they are fighting your battles too, and they will succumb, they must succumb, unless the workers in other countries come speedily to their help.Realise this.     The further prolongation of the vt&amp;v must lead to the defeat of the Russian Revolution and to the triumph of militarism and reaction everywhere.     The Russian capitalists and landlords are hoping for developments which may make safe their opportunities to exploit the Russian workers.     German and Austrian capitalists are doubly anxious to crush the Russian Revolution, because they realise that it will call for emulation on the part of their own deluded and oppressed peoples.     The British and French oppressors of the working class would see the Russian Revolutionaries handed over to the tender mercies of the militarists of the Central Powers rather than that the Russian Revolt should be firmly established as a shining example throughout Europe.     Will the British workpeople stand idly by while these unscrupulous moves are proceeding to thwart Free Russia in her val\iant stand for peace and working-class emancipation?     Russia works for peace while Allied statesmen work for territorial and economic advantage.     The Peoples&apos; Commissioners, by restating the case for international solidarity, have reached the minds and hearts of the German soldiers.     German militarism is being undermined by the propanganda of our troops and by our statements of war aims and peace policy.     An immediate, just, democratic peace, on the principle of No Annexation - No indemnities, will&quot;spell the downfall of militarism in all countries.     This peace can be achieved if only labour will speak in full voice and act with all its might.Workers of Britain - Peace is in the balance!     The Russian workers appeal to you to join them in their efforts to turn the scale.  &quot; Labour -speak!     Join us in our fight for Labour1s solidarity!     Workers of Europe, unite!
B,The Governments of the Peoples in alliance with Russia have not joined in the peace negotiations up to the present, and they have sternly refused to state clearly their reasons for their attitude.     It is impossible to affirm that the war is now for freeing Belgium, the Northern Departments of France, Serbia, and so on, because Germany and her allies are expressing their willingness to withdraw from these territories if a general peace is concluded.Now that the enemies have declared their peace conditions it is impossible to solve the existing difficulties by general expression as to the necessity of carrying on the war to the end.     It is   necessary to state clearly what is the peace program of France, Italy, Great Britain, and the United States.   Are they asking, like ourselves, that the right 01P determination of their own destinies should be given to the peoples of Alsace-Lorraine, Galicia, Posen, Bohemia, and South-Slavonia?     If they are doing so, are they willing also to recognise the right to self-det?rmination of their own destinies in the case of the peoples of Ireland, Egypt, India, Madagascar, Indo-China   and other countries, just as under the Russian Revolution this right has been given to the peoples of Finland, Ukrainia, Tflb.ite Russia, and other districts?3JC AfC 3(C SyC J^C *jCThe success of our programme will depend upon the degree in which the will of the Imperialistic classes will be paralysed, by the work of the Revolutionary proletariat in every country.     If the Allied Governments, with the blind tenaci which is characteristic of decadent perishing classes, again refuse to take part in peace negotiations, then the working classes will be placed under the iron necessity of grasping the authority from the hands of those who cannot; or will not, give peace to the peoples.In these ten days the destinies of hundreds of thousands and of millions of human lives will be settled.     If on the French and Italian fronts an armistice is not concluded before there is a.new offensive - irrational, pitiles; and useless, like all those that have preceded - new and incalculable sacrifices on both sides will be demanded.     This war, begun by the dominating classes, logically is leading to the complete destruction of European nations *     But the people will live^and they have the right to live.They must overflow all those who are not permitting them to live freely. Addressing the Governments with the present proposal to take part in peace negotiations, we promise everjr support to the working classes of every country which will rise against their own national Imperialists, chauvinists, and . militarists, under\fhe banner of peace, the brotherhood of peoples, and the Socialist reconstruction of society.(Signed)   L. TROTSKY,People&apos;s Commissioner for Foreign Affairs.
