This Meeting was held to consider the question of Chinese Labour Organisation in Northern France which had previously been discussed at the ? Cabinet on January 17th, War Cabinet 324, Minute 16).

LORD DERBY said that he had succeeded in obtaining the services of an Engineer, Sir E. Pearson, a brother of Lord Cowdray, who,  with the full concurrence of Sir D. Enig, was proceeding to France to undertake an inquiry into the whole question of Labour organisation, and report.

GENERAL TRAVERS CLARKE explained the present system of Labour Control at the ports. At each port the supply of labour is, as regards discipline and organisation, under the Base Commandant, who allocated the labour according to the demands which he receives from the different departments. If, for instance the Director-General of Transportation requires a certain number of men, he puts in a requistion to the Base Commadant. The man are then allotted out of the Base Commandant&apos;s Pool to the Director-General of Transportation, who, however, is not always possible to allot the same men continuously to the same class of work.

SIR E GEDDES said that his experience in France had led him to be entirely opposed to this system of supply and control of labour. He was in favour of allotting a reasonable minimum number of man to each of the Departments that required labour for various purposes, such as, roadmaking; docks; workshops; stores; ammunition depots. The number of men allotted permanently to each Department should be the minimum requirement, but it should not be an absolute figure; there should be a semi-permanent allocation behind it; and a pool of labour at the back of all.

In this way the obb and flow of busy and slack times would be provided for, but more especially the men, by being the main allotted permanently to the same job and under the same gangers, would take an increased interest in their work; their officers would get to know them; they would become more expert, and there would be an all round increase in efficiency.






This system has been tried in the Department of Transportation im franco in the case of the first 7,000 Chine se trough t over by the lirector-General of Transportation, and had proved a great sucoosa. Tke problem involved was the one familiar  to all of us in civil life of the efficiency of the permanent man against the inefficiency of the casual.    The system in force in France gave the maximum of casual labour.GENERAL TRAVER3 CLART3) said that he concurred generally in the desirability of keeping the same men at the same job; an&amp; i* ^8 *on* now to a considerable extent, but, on tho other hand^ if the men were allottei permanently to all the many departments such as those above-mentioned as well as to agriculture, salvage, and ordnanoo, tho fluidity of labour, which ezistod under the present system of the Pool, would disappear and control would cease.     The principle, how-ever, was that labour should so far as possible be employed on the same type of work and be changed as rarely as was compatible with the general demands for work,SIR ERIC GEDDFS contended that at present lEbour was &quot;nobody^ Child&quot;,, whereas if departments had a miiiimTim number of men permanent-ly allotted to them they could put in their interpreters and N.C.0Ts, and control would increase rather than diminish.SIR JOSEPH MACLAY and SIR GUY GRAKET said they concurred in the views oppressed by Sir E. Geddes.COLONEL MCLAREN BRO^E referred to the organisation of Chinese Labour on the Canadian Pacific Railway? durirf; construction period, with which he was acquainted-     There the system was different because the recruiting and control of the Chinese f:as kept in the hands of the Compradors.    The Railway Company dealt only with and through the Compradors.     The Chinese xaiderrtocd the system and it worked well, hut in the case of the Chinese in Northern France they had been recruited on a different basis, and under special conditions.TEE PRIMS MINISTER pointed out that in view of tho difficulties that were arising in Labour circles in this country in regard to the question of Man-Power, it was essential, that there should be no idle men in France such as those seen and described by the Shipping Controller.THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL proposed that, as a new scheme of Labour Organisation was on ite way from France, drawn up by Lieut.-General Travers Clarke, who has only boon Q.L.G. for some three weeks, it should be allowed a fair trial, and the question remain over for a month in order to see tho effect.LORD DERBY urged that the importation of Chinese should not be stopped.     The Army in Franca had recently undertaken numerous obli-gations of different sorts, all of which would require labour. There were the schemes for&quot;salvage; for agriculture behind tho linaa to the extent of some 50,000 acres; for timber-feliing. and for re-pairing ammunition.    All of those undertaking^ were intended to Save tonnage and make the Army more solf-con-^ined. -  If the supply of Chinese Labour were now. stopped, he feared iu oouid not be brought on again.TEE SHIPPING CONTROLLER said that he was submitting a Memorandum to the War Cabinet on the whole tonnage position which revealed a most serious situation, and he hoped that when It had been considered by the Cabinet the importation of Chinese Coolies might be entirely 3toppad.^itehall Gardens, S.7. 18th January,, 1918.
