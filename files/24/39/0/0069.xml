[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]308Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1913.SECRET.G.T.-3369.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the Week ending the 16th January, 1918.Part I: General Remarks.The serious situation on the Clyde is again examined.Part II: Press Opinions.Man Power, Pacifist Propaganda, War Aims, the Reconstruction Programme of the Labour Party, and the Subject of Food are the questions most frequently discussed in the Labour press.Part III: District Reports.In many parts of the country unrest has been caused by the food situation and the 12^ per cent, award. Opposition to the proposed comb-out is making itself heard, specially in London, Barrow, and on the Clyde.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving Stoppages. The strikes on the Clyde are the only serious cases under this head.(b.) Not involving Stoppages. The East Hope Street dispute on the Clyde, a dispute at the Austin Motor Works, Birmingham, and a question of the application of the 12^ per cent, to the Ironmoulders on the Tyne are the three more important disputes in progress.A distinct aggravation of the serious position on the Clyde has to be reported this week. At the present moment not less than 10,000 employees of the various shipyards are on strike, and it is anticipated that the number will increase. The nominal reason for direct action is a demand for extension of the 12^ per cent, advance to all piece-workers, and dissatisfaction at the withdrawal of an offer of 65. 9d. to them on the part of the employers.As was suggested in this report for last week, however, there can be little question that other factors are at work, which tend to intensify and embitter the general unrest. Of these the most important probably is the food position. As to this the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee, at a meeting held on the 8th instant, considered tjie Report of a Delegates Conference, at which it was resolved to recommend a general strike unless the Government handed over to co-operative and kindred societies for distribution &quot; the foodstuffs that are now held by the profiteers.&quot; This aspect is also emphasised by the Director of Shipyard Labour, who suggests that it would be possible for arrangements to be made whereby the food supplies for the men and their families might be sold in the canteens.Summary.I. General Remarks.The Situation on the Clyde.
Another cogent factor in the industrial unrest on the Clyde is the pacifist propaganda, combined with the man-power proposals now before the country. The activity of the pacifists in Glasgow has been the subject of frequent reference in these reports, and there can be no question whatever that their efforts have resulted in wide-spread sapping of the loyalty of the working men.&apos; A report in &quot; Forward &quot; describes Mr. Ramsay Macdonald&apos;s meetings at Rutherglen Town Hall and the Metropole Theatre on Sunday the 6th instant. The halls were crowded-thousands are stated to have been turned away, among them being individuals who offered a sovereign, for standing room. At the theatre Mr. Macdonald made a powerful pacifist appeal, supporting the Russian position, and expressing his belief that the German Social Democrats would see that the Russian: Revolution was not allowed to go down. A practice has now arisen of holding pacifist meetings outside the shop gates during the dinner hour, while literature has been systematically distributed among the men.Against this intelligent campaign, the only antidote has been a public meeting addressed by the Right Hon. G. N. Barnes. There has been no methodical loyalist campaign, as far as is known. Until definite and continuous steps are taken, no improvement in this respect is probable, and the loyal element must continue dis-heartened and apathetic.The man-power proposals have roused the keenest resentment among the extremists. A conference of representatives of the Clyde District Committees of societies affiliated to the Engineers&apos; and Shipbuilding Federation was held in Glasgow on the 12th instant, to discuss these proposals. After a debate extending over four hours, it was resolved that the meeting intimate to the Federation and to the Government, that unless the Man-Power Bill were withdrawn before the end of January, the delegates would advise their members on the Clyde to down tools. A further resolution called upon the Government to call an International Con-ference to discuss terms of peace.It is thus obvious that the unrest on the Clyde is mainly political and only partially industrial. The shop steward leaders, of whom William Galiacher and Arthur McManus are the most prominent, are a group of men of revolutionary ideas, who contemplate nothing less than a social and economic upheaval. In one of his speeches Gallacher plainly indicated the futility of relying on the ordinary political methods, while McManus on another occasion exhorted his headers to make Glasgow &quot;the Petrograd of Great Britain.&quot; To ensure their aims they are prepared to use every possible means to embarrass the existing Government. The food question and man-power are essentially favourable subjects for this policy. By their use they are able to secure support from men who hold entirely different economic and social views, but who are affected by food shortage, who desire to escape from military service, and are therefore willing to support any movement promising to improve the food supply, or to compel the Government to abandon its plan for increasing the man-power available for the army.It is very difficult to estimate the following which would support the extremists in their threat of a general strike in the event of Government maintaining its intention on the man-power question, or to make any prophecy as to the course which events are likely to take.It is believed that the shop stewards over-estimate their power even on the Clyde. It is true that, where the basis of the struggle has been of an industrial character that power has been successfully demonstrated. On the other hand, there is reason to doubt whether success would be certain if the ground of dispute were political. An attempt will very probably be made to produce a general strike on the wages question and to continue it on man-power. If, however, the man-power question could be isolated and could be brought home forcibly, there is reason to hope that the leaders would be discredited and their following very largely reduced. There is all the difference between a war on the capitalist employer and treachery to the army at the front, and it should be easily feasible to emphasise the fact.A further question on which it is impossible to venture any opinion with con-fidence, is the amount of practical sympathy which the Clyde would receive in a general strike on the man-power question. It is true that in Manchester, Barrow, Sheffield, and other places &quot;the shop stewards have passed resolutions similar to that referred to above, and that similar resolutions have been accepted at meetings of trade union branches in various parts of the country. There can also be little doubt that the spirit which animates these resolutions is anything but uncommon, and that many of the workmen, either through fear of the army or for pacifist reasons,
would bs glad to see the Government compelled to withdraw the proposal. It is not, however, thought that an attempt- at a strike on these grounds alone would be generally successful.The main point seems to be that the political and the industrial factors should respectively be isolated and the fight, which is bound to come, be fought on the political issue, unobscured by any question of wages or food: This is no doubt (difficult, but should not prove to be impossible. If it can be ensured, there is ever]?-probability that the loyalty of the great mass of the nation will support the Govern-ment, and make the position of any section which decides to strike untenable, but it would be folly to disguise the ugly possibilities of the situation.II. Peess Opinions. Man Power and Pacifist Propaganda.The occasion of the necessity for a further comb-out for the army has stimulated the pacifist portion of the Labour press to extraordinary exertion.The &quot;-Herald &quot; is frankly hostile to the proposals made by Sir Auckland Geddes, and Robert Williams uses its columns for a contemptuous article on the proceedings at the Conference. He advises Labour to refuse any further concessions.&apos; It is noticeable that the &quot; Labour Leaderonly mentions this matter in its editorial notes, in which it remarks with approval on hostile resolutions which have been passed in certain quarters. The &quot; Call&quot; insists on the power of the working classes, in combination with those of other lands, to stop the war. The &quot; Leeds Citizen &apos;&apos; advises the shop stewards to insist upon conscription of wealth before any further comb-out is even discussed.The pacifist agitation is taking the form of a demand for British Labour to identify itself with the Russian position, and to compel the Government to recognise that of Russia and to join in the peace negotiations. In this effort the pacifist papers print M. LitvinofPs appeal to the workers of Great Britain, and the &quot; Call &quot; publishes in full Trotzky&apos;s wireless manifesto of the 29th December to the peoples and Governments of the allied countries. The idealism of the Bolsheviks receives the most blatant adulation, and in certain quarters (as, for instance, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot;) the fiction is maintained that Germany still adheres to the formula &quot;no annexations and no indemnities.&quot; The &quot;Herald&quot; commences its article &quot; Now or Never a People&apos;s Peace &quot; with a statement that the idealism, the courage, and the statesmanship of the Bolsheviks have forced an international situation in which peace seems imminent, and calls upon Labour to support the attitude taken up by Russia.In the &quot; Labour Woman &quot; for January, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald has an article which discloses a number of the difficulties attendant on a League of Nations, a policy of which he is clearly not enamoured, and which he hedges round with impracticable conditions.War Aims.The speech of the Prime Minister to the representatives of Trade Unions on the subject of War Aims has been discussed at great length in all journals, and this not so much on account of its terms, as because its. occasion was a private meeting with official Labour, and because it is held to be a milestone on the road to ultimate peace. These aspects are specially stressed by the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; which contends that the statement as to Alsace-Lorraine does not prevent negotla-tions on that point, and the &quot; Call.&quot; The &quot; Herald &quot; adopts an attitude of solitude and hostility, analyses the speech much to its detriment, though illogically if the Russian formula of self-determination be accepted, and concludes that the Central Powers cannot combine maintenance of their legitimate dignity with acceptance of the terms indicated by Mr. Lloyd George. On the whole it may be said that the pronouncement has a good press.The LLP.The phenomenal growth of the LLP. during the past year, specially in Scotland, where its branches are stated to have increased by 50 per cent, and its
numbers by 300 per cent., is discussed by the party papers on the occasion of the Annual Conference, with much self-congratulation. There can be little doubt that, both in Scotland and in many parts of England, the power of the party has increased even more than the reported figures of numbers would indicate.The Labour Party&apos;s Reconstruction Scheme.The drastic scheme of reconstruction outlined in the pamphlet lately issued by the Labour Party with a view to its adoption at the forthcoming Conference has been accepted by the Labour press generally as a statesmanlike document. It is ascribed by the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; to Messrs. Sidney Webb and Ramsay Macdonald. The possibility of the programme proving a disruptive force is indi-cated by the &quot; Call,&quot; which considers that its object is amelioration rather than abolition of the wage system, while its nationalisation proposals are likely to evoke opposition from the Guild Socialists.Food.Every paper deals at length with the food question, all being critical of the action of the Food Controller, with the exception of the &quot;Clarion,&quot; which voices a realisation of the difficulties under which he labours. Several papers warn the -Government of the danger to be anticipated from a continuance of the queue system, for which the general remedy proposed is &quot;commandeering of all supplies and subse-quent distribution by Government agency. The &quot; Call &quot; questions why workers give their lives on the battlefields and yet allow their women folk and children to starve at home, while the &quot;Herald &quot; continues its campaign against the provision of supplies to hotels and restaurants. Compulsory rationing is anticipated for April the &quot; Clarion &quot; suggesting that the 1st of April would be a suitable date for its commencement.III. District Reports.London.The situation in this district continues to be unsettled, owing chiefly to the shortage of food and the impending comb-out.It is reported that the London District Vigilance Committee of the A.S.E. have put forward a resolution to adopt a national &quot; down tools &quot; policy unless a considerable improvement in the food situation takes place. They are said to be asking for the support and the co-operaition of Trades Unions comprising the Industrial Triple Alliance, and have been circularising working-class organisations in various parts of the country.Rioting is reported to have occurred at a butcher&apos;s shop at Woolwich, necessi-tating the calling up of mounted constables to restore order.Branches of the A.S.E. throughout the London area are bitterly opposed to the comb-out, and it is s stated that a mass meeting will be held on Sunday, the 27th January, to discuss the resolution, passed at Manchester, against the man-power proposals.It is perhaps significant that the Woolwich Shop Stewards Committee have joined the National Shop Stewards Movement.At Messrs. Cubitts, members of the A.S.E. maintain that the Government have broken their agreement, and that if any of their members are claimed for the Army a general strike will follow.The following resolution was passed by the Erith District Committee of the A.S.E.:  -&quot; That this Committee pledge themselves to resist by all possible means any further call upon the man-power of the Nation unless the Government immediately intimate their willingness to adopt the war aims of the Labour Party, permit and facilitate the holding of an international Conference, and agree without delay to conscript wealth.&quot;Much grumbling is reported amongst operatives at the light machine shops in the laboratory department, Woolwich, where the authorities are stated to have
cut down the working hours to 48 hours a week. Trouble is anticipated because of the abolition of overtime. The men say that they cannot live on a 48 hours weekly pay.West Midlands.Apart from the increasing agitation over the Food question the situation in this area appears easier.There is much grumbling about the shortage of meat, butter, margarine, and sugar, and it is reported that the workers do not appear satisfied that any real attempt is being made towards a fairer distribution of foodstuffs. .The shop stewards at Coventry are endeavouring to bring about the abolition of overtime in all local factories. It is alleged that the old hands are put on &quot; short time;&quot; and that the recent recruits to munition factories reap the benefits of the extra time that is worked.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Matters in this district are now practically normal. Sheffield workers are reported to be thoroughly satisfied with their recent success over the 12^ per cent, bonus. The following suggestion which has been made by certain Sheffield workers is interesting. They think that the Government would do well to deal with Trade Union representatives in a body and not sectionally, and that this procedure would command respect from all workers.The Sheffield shop stewards have decided to stand by Glasgow and Manchester in oposing the comb-out.The suggestion of a patriotic Sheffield workman that if the movement were to receive full and ungrudging recognition it would, by becoming more constitutional, become more moderate and be willing to work in greater harmony with the Govern-ment, is worthy of note.North-Western.The situation in this district is quiet, though at Barrow the food question continues to cause unrest. Barrow shop stewards are making the most of this question, and at a recent meeting Tom Mann said that unless matters improved there was something in the nature of a revolution in store for the country. A deep-seated economic change was necessary, and the Government were playing up to make such a change. Whatever the reasons may be, the difficulties in the way of obtaining foodstuffs would appear to have been more serious in Lancashire than elsewhere during the last few weeks.No improvement has taken place as regards the queues, and a serious strike had occurred amongst coal-miners near Burnley (Section IV).The Barrow shop-stewards have decided to hold a mass meeting at the Town Hall next Sunday to discuss the man-power question., They have been refused- the use of the Town Hall, and are now threatening to declare a one-day strike unless their demand for that building is met.At Liverpool the position is much better, and a meeting on the subject of man-power, held on the 14th, though poorly attended, refused to agree to the shop stewards&apos; proposals to veto any further comb-out. These proposals are expressed in the following resolution passed at a meeting of Liverpool shop stewards on the 13th:-&quot; . . . . This Conference of shop stewards of the Liverpool district strongly protests against any further combing out from the work shop, and further demand.that all the leisured and propertied classes shall be treated in like manner to Trade Unionists.&quot;A rider was added by Mr. Bell and adopted, that a referendum of the fighting forces should be taken as to whether the war shall be carried on.The employees at Messrs. Graysons, who employ 5,000 men, are irritated by the absence of proper travelling facilities; and threaten to strike on1 the 6th February as a protest.Traffic facilities in Liverpool are stated to be unsatisfactory, and a suggestion has been made that additional trams and trains should be put on early in the morn-ing and in the evening. , :
North-Eastern.Although there is still some dissatisfaction among moulders on the East Coast on account of the alleged refusal of certain members of the Employers&apos; Federation to pay the 12^ per cent, advance, this area is much quieter.Scotland.The situation on the Clyde is dealt with in Section I. South Wales.From an industrial point of view the situation in South Wales continues to be fairly satisfactory. The men are, however, concentrating on the food question, which affords a ground on which the patriotic workman can work in harmony with the pacifist.At Neath on the 12th there was some danger of a riot outside a grocer&apos;s shop, and stormy meetings, held for the most part under the auspices of local Trades and Labour Councils, have occurred in various districts. The most important of these was held on Sunday last at Porth, and representatives of a large section of the miners in the Rhondda Valley were present. The following resolution was passed:-&quot; That this joint meeting of Nos. 1 and 2 Rhondda Districts of minersprotest against the inadequate supplies and distribution of food-stuffs, andunless this is remedied within the next 14 days, 40,000 of the South Walesminers will stop work for 1 day to show their sincerity.&quot;It is feared that should this threat be put into practice a district much wider than the Rhondda Valley would be affected.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a stoppage of work.The situation is not accurately reflected in the number of strikes and disputes which have occurred during the past week; as has been demonstrated in Part I it is very serious.The Burnley coal strike, affecting 3,000 miners, was, perhaps, the most significant-strike of the week originating as it did in the Food Question, which continues to be the main underlying cause of industrial unrest. Equitable distribution was the demand put forward by the miners, but as soon as it was clearly demonstrated to them by the Local Food Control Committee that the Government were indeed distributing foodstuffs equally the men realised that there was no reason for prolonging the strike which had lasted two days.Although there are only four new strikes reported during the week ending the 12th January by the Shipyard Labour Department, and none of these in the Glasgow area, the position on the Clyde is very unsatisfactory. During the present week the strike of boilermakers employed on piece-work at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s has spread to other firms.This strike, which has been described in a- former report, commenced on the &apos;26th December last, when 3,198 boilermakers employed by Messrs. Beardmore, Yarrows, John Brown, Harland and Wolff, Simons and Scotts, ceased work, demanding the extension of the 12  per cent, advance to all pieceworkers. Practically all work has been suspended at each of these yards owing to the new year holidays.In addition to those mentioned above, the caulkers employed by the following firms also ceased work: Barclay Curie and Company, Brys and Glysen, Fairfield Shipbuilding . and Engineering Company, West Yard, and Whit-einch. Stoppages have also taken place at eleven other firms. A total of 7,770 men were out on strike during the week, but it is stated that the Clyde Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation have offered to premium bonus and pieceworkers the equivalent of the 12^ per cent, war advance. The men are now considering the offer. The Department further state that the press announcement by the Ministry of Labour regarding the 12J per cent, advance to pieceworkers has not been well received, the men and delegates taking the view that to attempt a revision of low piece work rates at the present time will cause trouble.Strikes, no one of which is individually serious though in the aggregate they represent a large cessation of work, are reported from various districts as having originated in the 12  per cent, award.In the Manchester district, for example, several stoppages have occurred, at Partick 300 unskilled workers are out, and at Jarrow there has been a strike of bricklayers.
The Ministry of Munitions report considerable unrest among bricklayers in all the iron and steel trades in South Wales.Becently a short strike occurred for a flat rate of Is. 6d. per hour, but the men were induced to return pending a reference to the Committee on Production.The Committee decided against the claim on the ground that the notice required under the agreements had not been given, and awarded them in the meantime a war bonus of l d. per hour. This award has given great dissatisfaction, and the strike is beginning again. The Swansea men stopped work on the 9th January, and the Llanelly men had decided to do so on the 11th January. It is feared that the whole of the building trades may join in sympathy.Two new disputes involving a stoppage of work are reported by the War Office Contracts Department.A short stoppage occurred in the factory of Messrs. Dent Allcroft and Company, Worcester, on account of the workers refusing to accept the district rate of 8/6 per dozen for making aviators&apos; leather gloves-; they demanded 12/-. However, the operatives agreed to give the work a week&apos;s trial at the price of 8/6 per dozen.The Coal Controller reports four new strikes for the week ending the 15th January. In addition to the strike at Burnley, which has already been discussed, a somewhat serious strike occurred for three days at a Lanarkshire Colliery ron account of some small disputes in which the county officials of the Miners&apos; Union had not been consulted. One of the county officials was communicated with and the strike settled.The miners involved in the strike at the Staveley Coal and Iron Company&apos;s Works have now been able to resume work, the Staveley engineers having been granted the 12\ per cent, advance. As stated in last week&apos;s report, in consequence of the engineers of the above-mentioned firm striking over the 12^ per cent, bonus, four collieries were compelled to close down, and several thousand miners were thrown out of work.(b.) Not involving a stoppage of work.Although the unrest among Clyde workers regarding the 12^ per cent, bonus is still serious the dispute at the factory of Messrs. Beardmore and Company, East Hope Street, which at one time threatened to bring out the whole of the Clyde district, has (as was mentioned in last week&apos;s report) been settled.Sir George Askwith, who personally investigated the case, found that the accusations of deliberate reduction of output were well founded, but that the four women who had been dismissed were not particularly to blame. Messrs. Beardmore have offered to find work for these women, and it is hoped that the trouble is now finally settled.It is reported that if a settlement is not arrived at shortly regarding the district rate of the Barrow and Furness Bailwaymen the shop stewards will endeavour to promote a strike immediately. It is believed that the Barrow workers will be only too glad to seize the opportunity of striking in sympathy with the railwaymen, rather than to make it obvious that they are opposed to the comb-out.A representative of the Ministry of Labour has proceeded to Barrow and is meeting the men.The Ministry of Munitions reports that the Edinburgh joiners working in the building trade demand a provisional advance of 2d. per hour, to run until their agreement with the Edinburgh Master Builders&apos; Association expires.This demand has been rejected, and the men&apos;s union has sent to all firms in Edinburgh a letter stating that unless the advance is paid immediately they &quot; will look for higher rates elsewhere.&quot;Woodworkers in the London district are growing more restless regarding the employers&apos; delay in signing the agreement in respect of their increase in wages. The men &quot;still threaten that if this agreement for the payment of the l/3id. is not signed in the course of the next ten days work-will cease.A serious dispute is in progress at the Austin Motor Works, Birmingham, owing to a demand that a 50 per cent, increase should be granted in lieu of the existing war bonus which is paid monthly on output. Eepeated attempts have been made to settle this matter, but without success, and the men threaten to come out in February if they are not met.   A strike would involve more than 10,000 men.The Coal Controller reports five new cases of dispute. It is stated that trouble in connection with the shortage of food is threatened in the Walsall district. No organised stoppage has taken place, but it is understood that the output is suffering on account of an increasing number of workers being absent from their work, presumably in order to secure their share of food.It is believed that the inter-union dispute at the New Shorlston Collieries will be settled as the result of an interview which was arranged locally between the president of
the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association and the, secretary of the Local Surfacemen&apos;s Union. . It will be remembered that the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association have for some time urged that the surfacemen should join their union.Eleven new cases of dispute are reported by the Shipyard Labour Department. There is considerable unrest amongst the ironmoulders in the Newcastle area regard-ing a 12^ per cent, advance.In this district the men are agitating for an extension of the bonus to pieceworkers, and a ballot is being taken by the Friendly Society of Ironfounders as to whether they will &quot; down tools &quot; to-day if the increase is not paid. The moulders at Messrs. Palmer and Company, Hebburn, have given seven days&apos; notice to cease piecework and overtime. The notices have expired,- and piecework and overtime have ceased. The representatives of the Employers&apos; Federation and the firms are dealing with the matter.The War Office Contracts Department announce four new cases of disputes not involving a stoppage.An application: for an advance to leather workers in the Leeds district has been submitted by the National Leather Trades Federation, and it was not until recently that it was agreed, to refer the matter- to arbitration. In the meantime, however, the employees of1 one firm have handed in a week&apos;s. notice and have refused to await the arbitrator^ decision; it is understood that their demands are in excess of those made by the union. The matter has been referred to the Chief Industrial Commissioner^ Department, and the secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Leather Workers have promised to try and effect a resumption of work immediately.Eighty-five new differences were reported to the Chief Industrial Com-missioner&apos;s Department during the week.Eighteen of them are in the engineering, shipbuilding, and other metal trades. It is noteworthy that the number of cases reported during the week is smaller than during the immediately preceding week.Attention may be called to the agreed decision by Sir George Askwith in respect of the Master Carters&apos; Association of Great Britain and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, the general effect of which is to give a war wage advance of not less than 20/-per week to commercial drivers, stable and garage hands and mates, and trailermen in the carting industry of Great Britain.The Committee on Production during the past week heard forty-one. cases, seventeen in London, and. twenty-four in Scotland. In addition the members of the Committee sat as a Special Arbitration Tribunal under Section 1 (2) of the Munitions of War Act, 1917, and heard three cases that had been referred to them arising out of the 12^ per cent.
