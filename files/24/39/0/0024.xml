tThe formula of &quot;the Self-Determination of Peoples&quot;-and the Moslem World.A.   Situation before the War.Before the VTar a very large majority of the Moslems in the world were under the   government of the most advanced democracies in Europe - England, France and Holland.     Public opinion in the ruling countries took for granted the contrast between the free institutions which they had established for themselves and the bureaucratic government, resting in the last resort on military power, which they had imposed on their Oriental subjects.   Long contact, with these subjects had made them believe that Europeans and Orientals were far apart in political capacity, and were there-fore not entitled to the same political rights.     Y/hen individuals or parties among the subject populations, inspired through contact with Europe with European ideas, treated the rights of Orientals as though they were on a^ European footing,  and demanded corresponding political reforms, their activities were commonly regarded by their rulers as being merely imitative, and were resisted uncompromisingly in so far as they appeared to endanger the good administration which European rule was giving the country, and of which the rulers were justly proud.     The ruling peoples admitted that their subjects might develoo in the end the real qualifications for self-government, as well as the desire for it, but they regarded this development as almost infinitely remote, and as only attainable through the continuation of the existing regime.Ther European democracies therefore maintained their system of government in their Oriental dependencies as it was, with a perfectly clear conscience; in this they were supported by the general public opinion of Europe, including European peoples that had no Oriental subjects of their own; and the great mass of the subject Orientals, especially the peasantry, &quot;-were evidently contented j
ewith the situation on the whole.Ho one in Europe before the War honestly thought of the question of Ireland and the question of India as being the same in kind, or regarded the French conquest and domination of Algeria as on a par morally with the German conquest and domination of Alsace-Lorraine.B.   The iGerman War Propaganda&apos;To obscure this distinction has been one of the chief aims of German Propaganda since the War began.The right of nations to determine their own destiny, which the Entente has proclaimed, strikes at the basiB of German Imperialism and Militarism in Europe, but it is not easy for Germany to parry the blow.    This right is regarded as the birth-right of Europeans by European public opinion; and the Entente is fighting to defend it and ex-bend its range, while the Central Powers are fighting not only to withhold it from the nationalities previously subject to them, but to take it away, whether openly or indirectly, from Belgium, Serbia, Rumania, Montenegro, which have enjoyed it hitherto.    Ho formula reveals so clearly the justice of the Allies1 cuaee and the injustice of Germany&apos;s, and no programme will be so fatal to Germany * s aims as this,, if it is carried through.     Yet Germany cannot declare herself against self-determination without exposing herself to condena-ation and alienating the world&apos;s sympathy altogether.     She has accordingly pursued her regular tactics and defended an   in-defensible position by an offensive of her own.    She has tried to divert attention from the fact that she is the arch-enemy of self-determination in Europe by constituting herself the champion of the same principle in the Oriental World, and challenging &quot;the accepted view about English, Prench, Russian and Italian government in Mohammedan countries.The German Propaganda has been extraordinarily active in this
direction.    The domination of Turkey. i&amp;mgary and Anetria over, jBugCE+ag nationalities has been cowed by raising the question ofthe Moslems 4n-Jtuae4jr.

Delegates, or self-styledrepresentatives, of the Egyptian nationalists, the Indiannationalist Committee in Europe, the Kirghiz, the. Moslems ofTrench North Africa, the Persian People, the Chagatal Turks ofRussian Central Asia, and the whole body of Turee-Tatar Jktosls&amp;gin Russia, sought an audience at Btockhola-TFith/-the Dutch-*Soandiiwim^lntwn^li^3 BoclaJ 1st Qoamittee; and theirmanifestos were published in extenso in a special supplement toone of the numerous German periodicals that deal with Oriental(x) affairs,The most aggressive use of this treapon was made by the German Majority Socialist Party, In the memorandum they-pr&amp;eeated to the Stockholm Committee on the-same-occasion.&quot;By national^3l^l^rmiaation,&quot; they here declare, &quot;we understand the right of nations to maintain or get back heir political independence;&quot; and they endorse the application of this formula to nations which have lost their independence during the Var or recovered an independence denied them under the statue qgc ante (Belgium and Serbia being in the first oategory, Finland and Russian Poland in the second).&quot;A third group of ancient independent nations,1&apos; the memorandum continues, &quot;which have become the Tictims of(x)   &quot;Der ffeue Orient&quot;, Band I, Heft 11/12: 15th Sept.. 1917.r
imperialistic oppression, consists-&quot;of Ireland, Egypt. Tripoli, Morocco, India, Tibet and Korea.     German Social Democracy prc-^ nouncee the greatest sympathy with the efforts of all these nations to reestablish their national freedom......&quot;The Memorandum goes on to refuse anything more than &quot;cultural autonomy&quot; to &quot;German citizens who speak Danish, polish and French as their mother-tongue&quot;, and passes over the oppressed national-ities of Turkey. Hungary and Austria in absolute silenoe.This memorandum overreached itself by its gross hypocrisy. The German Majority Socialists1 attitude was severely oritioised by the Dutch-ScandLinavian Committee; the Oriental delegates met frith a oool reception; and on the whole it may be said that this branch of German Propaganda has been a failure.     In the United States, for example, (which was the main testing-ground of propaganda in the early stages of the lifer), the Germans did not succeed in transferring the stigma of Imperialism from themselves to the Allies, though they had the Irish&quot;Americans to back them and oould dispose of such weapons as the Hon. William Jennings Bryanls book (written before the T?ar) against British government in India. It was always possible for us to convince American public opinion about Egypt and India on the merits of the case; and the Acting Consul-General at Moscow states that even in Russia since the Revolution this is still so, whenever there is an Englishman on the spot to challenge the German contentions.The eagerness displayed by German professors in writing up Turkeyfs &quot;Holy \7ar&quot; has also produced an adverse effect on European and American public opinion - especially among the Dutch, with their large Moslem population   in the East Indies.     the &quot;Holy Y/ar&quot; propaganda has been shown up, as the unscrupulous and anarchic manoeuvre that it is, by such distinguished Orientalists as Professor Snouck Hurgronje.On the whole, then, the relation between European States
and their Moslem subjects has not been affected by German Prop-aganda.    But it has been, on the other hand, by the oourse of events in Turkey and Russia.C.    The Bridge between Europe and the East.It has been pointed out that in the empires belonging to the democratic peoples of Western Europe, the distinction between the European and Oriental parts of the State is clear.     Great Britain and Ireland, for example, are separated from India by a three-weeks * sea voyage, they have a different climate and vegetation, a differently coloured population, different history, tradition and civilisation.    It is the same with the empires of Holland, France sad Italy.    But there are two great states, Turkey and Russia, which occupy between them the land-bridge between Europe and the East, and embrace Europeans and Orientals in one political body without any clear-cut division between them.In Turkey and Russia, Europe and the East merge into one another by an unbroken transition, and the politioal philosophy of the different rights of Europeans and Orientals, based on the structure of the West European colonial empire, breaks down. Before the War, however, the relations between European and Oriental were regarded solely from the WeBt European point of view, because Turkey and Russia were both for various reasonsraled out of count.In Turkey, by a curious anachronism, a Moslem State was ruling - and ruling atrociously - over Christian populations; and this half obscured and half justified, in the eyes of Europe, the fact that in the rest of the world the rfcles of ruler and ruled had long been reversed.     In Turkey the immediate problem was to liberate European nationalities from an unnatural domination.   It was an axiom that the Turk was unfit to rule others, but the question had not arisen whether he was capable of ruling himself -that is, whether he, as an Oriental, had a claim to the right of
self-determination, like the European peoples Who were success-ively freeing themselves from his misgovernment.In Russia the transition between Europe and the East was, and is, more gradual still.    $he most Oriental Europeans in the world and the most Buropeanised Orientals are both to be found in Russia, not separated by geographical barriers, but inter-mingled in the same provinces and even in the.same towns; and these shade off in either direction into an advanced Western society towards the Baltic and into a practically pure Oriental society in Central Aaia.    Petrograd and Bokhara are linked to-gether by Koocow, Kassa. Baku, Orenburg, Tashkent and not separatee&apos;   by an ocean IfMi London and Dslhi.But before the $for the natural operation of Russia as a political conductor Wbweon Europe and the Bast was prevented Jby the Tsardom, which arrested the current of political life in every element of which Russia was composed.    The underlying tendencies could not come to light, and the Teardom itself* which. stood between Sussia and the out or  world, Was&apos; regarded by European public opinion as something scandalous., exceptional and transitory - certainly not as a guide to the proper relations between the European and oriental worlds.Thus it happened that before the War conditions in Russia or Turkey had practically no influence over the relations between, Europe and the East, and that these were shaped entirely by the structure of the British, French, Dutch and Italian oriental empires, and by the political philosophy that structure suggested.Meanwhile, however, there have been changes in&apos; Turkey and Russia which seem likely to give them a determining influence over the problem.
Turkey practically ceased, after the Balkan V/ar, to rule over any European nationalities - with the notable excep-tion of the Armenians - and at the same moment the Turkish population of the Ottoman Empire began to acquire a national consciousness of its own.     This new Turkish national movement has been discussed in two previous memoranda - on &quot;the Pan-Turanian Movement&quot; and on &quot;the Turkish Attitude towards Peace&quot;. Its aims are (a) internal independence and fb) Uurcification within as large a territory as it oan secure, if possible up to the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire as they existed before the War.This Turkish movement appears to be a genuine as the national movements of the European peoples - Serbs, Greeks, and Bulgars - who have thrown off Ottoman rule during the last oentury;   and it has obtained recognition from Germany as the main condition of Turkey1s alliance with Germany in the war. Germany has bad to renounce all prescriptive rights, and acknowledge Turkey&apos;s complete sovereignty, in the abolition of the capitulations, revision of the tariff, penalisation of non-Turkish languages, massacre of Armenians and Greeks, and other &quot;internal measures carried through by the C.U.P. during the War.     Her homage to the Turks1 &quot;right of self-determina-tion&quot; may be largely superficial.     She has succeeded in re-placing the Capitulations, for instance, by a reciprocal treaty securing mutual privileges to the nationals of either state residing in the territory of the other, and these privileges will benefit Germany almost exclusively, since there are many Germans in Turkey and very few Turks in Germany.    She has also gained a greater potential hold over Turkey - militarily, economically and financially - than any single Power ever gained in previous periods.     But it remains to be seen whether

She has also gained a greater potential hold over Turkey - militarily, economically and financially - than any single Power ever gained in previous periods.     But it remains to be seen whether
she can use it, or whether the principle of equality and reciprocity, which she has admitted, as the price of it, in her dealings with Turkey, will not prove a more effective factor in the situation that the paper contracts by which the German loans and concessions are guaranteed.At any rate Germany, in her attitude towards the Turkish national movementj has set a new precedent in the relations between European and Oriental peoples;   and Great Britain has responded to GermanyTs equal alliance with the Turkish nation by supporting a movement for national self-determination among the Arab populations of the Ottoman Empire and cooperating with them on a similar footing.It may be argued here again that the self-deter-mination is only nominal;   that the revolt of the Heiaz was initiated by Great Britain, and has all along been dependent on British military and naval power, while the &quot;liberation&quot; of Mesopotamia is simply another name for the British military occupation.of it.    This view is taken, indeed, by most Moslems under European rule - in Russia, India, Egypt and French North Africa - who regard the King of the Hejaz as a British agent and the Arab movement as a betrayal of Islam which has broken up the last independent Moslem Great Power; so much so, in fact,.- -t.hat all mention of the movement of of King Hussein has to be avoided in our Moslem propaganda. But this has driven us all the more to proclaim the absolute independence and self-determination of the Arab nation in principle.&quot;The Hejaz&quot;, King Hussein declares in his pro-clamation of June S7tb, 1916, &quot;stands quite apart and diB-tinct from countries that still groan under the yoke of the O.U.P.     She is independent in the fullest sense of the word, freed from the rule of strangers and purged of eves^foreign influence......&quot;
&quot;In Hejaz&quot;, it was announced in General Maude1s proclamation of March 19tjr, 1917, after his entry into Baghdad, &quot;the Arabs have expelled the Turks and Germans who oppressed them and proclaimed the Sherif HuBsein as their King, and His lordship rules in independence and freedom, and is the ally of the nations who are fighting against the power of 2urkey and Germany;   so indeed, are the noble Arabs, the ^ords of Koweyt, Nejd and Asir.&quot;It may be said that in these phrases King Hussein is implicitly equated with chieftains who are under various degrees of British suzerainty, but it is equally true that these are raised to a level with him.    King Husseinfs roal independence is guaranteed within eertaln limits by his possession of a holy oity which no European may enter.    To this extent he is essentially beyond our political control, and to be mentioned in the same terms aB the Lord of the Kaaba must heighten the sense of sovereignty in our protege the Sheikh of Koweit, and indireotly in the Sheikh of Moham-mera, the Sultan of Oman, and every native prince in India.&quot;It is the hope end desire of the British people and the nations in alliance with them&quot;, the proclamation oon-tinues, &quot;that the Arab raoe may rise onoe more to greatness and renown among the peoples of the earth, end that it shall bind itself together to this end in unity and concord......&quot;Therefore I am commanded to invite you, through your nobles and elders and representatives, to participate in the management of your oivil affairs in collaboration with the political representatives of Great Britain who accompany the British Army, so that you may be united with your kinsmen in North, ^ast, South and &quot;nest in realising the aspirations of your race.&quot;
-10Why should this union of the Arabs be confined to those who live easi of the Suea Canal?    And why should not Arab representatives participate in the management of civil affairs in Egypt, Tripoli^ and Jfrencb North Africa, where the Arab tradition is as  aoient and contemporary Arab sCoiety as progressive as i^n the province of Irak? These questions are bound to be raised in Arab minds by the wording of the proclamation.In the Ottoman limpire, then, where the principle of self-determination for Orientals was unheard of a few years ago,, it has now been asserted by the two chief Moslem peoples and solemnly acknowledged in each ease by a Great^uropcan Power.    This will have its effect on the vast(i)Turkish1    and Arab populations elsewhere under European rule, however much they may deprecate one or other movement on grounds of policy;   while the acknowledged sovereignty of the C.U.P. end king Hussein will be the envy of every &quot;native&quot; ruler at present under a European protectorate.But tho change in the Ottoman Empire is sur-passecl in importance by the ohange in Russia.102(1)    Several of the leading nationalists in Turkey are  uroo-Tatars from Russia.
The Change in Russia. The existence of the Russian State creates pclitical uniformity among European and Oriental populations who differ extremely in culture and are spread over a vast area, while its frontiers cause a sharp break in political regime between pooulations culturally and racially akin.    Across the artificial frontiers where this breafe occurs under whatever regime prevails in Russia at the time, that regime with the huge mass of Russia embodying it, exercises a formidable attractive power.Before the Revolution the Tsarist regime was carried byHRussia into the heart of Europe - to Melsingfors, Riga and Warsaw - and its reactionary influence was felt by Europe as a whole.     Ind now, since the Revolution, the Socialist-natonalist regime derived from Europe is being carried by Russia into the heart of the East - to Samarkand and Bokhara.     The break new occurs at the Asiatic instead of the European frontiers, and the new political current in Russia is likely to be conducted acroad these frontiers into Persia, Afghanistan, India, China, attract-ing the oriental populations of these countries, and especially the Moslems, towards the &quot;self-determination&quot; which the Russian Moslems have been securing for themselves.The Russian Moslems began to &quot;decide their own destiny&quot; the moment the Revolution began, and as the Revolution has advanced they have obtained a constantly fsseer hand.TMs movement is being led by the Kazan Tatars - who have been a centre of Moslem culture for a thcnscnd years and members of a European State for more than three hundred, a. larger period than any other Ltoslc-ms now under European rule - and by the Baku Turks, who have been introduced to modern industrialism by the development of their Ail-fields and have produced a powerful little   group of capitalists and men of affairs.     Their object
is to organise politically the nineteen million Moslems scatteredover the territory of Russia, who numerically are the strongestnon-Russian element after the Ukrainians, but have hitherto beenhandicapped by disunion, conservatism, and the deliberate penal-isation to ?/hich they were subjected by the Tsardom.     They haveheld a series of congresses - a Pan-Caucasian Moslem Congress atBaku in April 1917, a Moslem 7omen&apos;s Congress at Orenburg in thesame month, an All-Russian Moslem ^ongress in May, another All-Russian Congress at Kazan at the beginning of August, and a xMilitary   and Ecclesiastical Congress at the same place and date. The May Congress appointed an All-Russian Moslem Ctuncil, in which the local groups were represented in proportion to their numbers, and this Council has elected a standing Executive Committee, which sits permanently at Moscow and publishes a weekly bulletin there.The watchwords of the leaders are democracy and unity.   They have taken up higher education and the emancipation of women; unified the ecclesiastical government of the Moslems in Russia, and democratised it by making the new ecclesiastioal authorities elective on the basis of universal Moslem suffrage;   secured co-operation between Sunni and Shia, and taken steps towards common action with other non-Russian elements in Russia, especially the non-Foslera Asiatics.     In June 1917, for example, the All-Russian Moslem Council conferred with representatives of the Kalmucks1 Under the Tsardom the Kazan (Volga and Ural) Tatars were the only Moslems in Russia subject to conscription - less than five million out of the total nineteen.     But volunteer cavalry regiments were raised for the 7ar from the Horth-Caucasian mountain tribes, who supported General Kornilov and have since returned to their homes; and the Trans-Caucasian Moslems are now privately arming themselves too .
%Buriats and Yakuts, and proposed the appointment of a mixed corn-mission to attend to their common interests.     And local Moslem groups have made similar^aaa^^&amp;ss. of their own - nstably the Crimean Turks with the Ukraine.In all these points, and especially the last , the Ail-Russian Moslem Movement. .shows a remarkable similarity to the activities of the All-India Moslem League.     In 1965, for the first time, the League met at the same place and date as the Hindu National Congress, and appointed a Committee to draw up a programme ef re-forms &quot;in collaboration with the representatives of %&amp;&amp;kt organi-sations&quot;.     In the course of the next year they arrived at an agreement with the Hindu leaders, and the two organisations again met at the same place and date at the end of 1916, made speeches on each other&apos;s platforms, and promulgated their joint demands to-gether.     The pace in India is bound to be quickened by the Russian developments.   The Russian Moslems have made more progression months than the Indian in years, yet of the two the Indian Moslems have the stronger claim to self-determination. theirsixty-seven millions they number 21 per cent of the population of India, while the nineteen mill ion Russian Moslems amount to only 12-J- per cent, at most, of the population of Russia.    And the average level of civilization among the Indian Moslems is higher; for though their leaders hardly compare with Moslem Europeans like the Tatars of Kazan or twentieth-century industrialists like the Turkish leaders of Baku, yet the Moslem villager   of Bengal has more capaoity for political life than the nomadic Kirghiz and Turkmens of the steppe-oountry.The Russian and Indian Movements   will doubtless react on one another in the future, and the more so since the parallelism between them has not been due to mere chance.     Their tendencies
ars similar because they are both manifestations of a general move-ment pervading the whole Moslem world.Their most striking common characteristic is a growing sensi-tiveness to the fate of Moslems outside their own countries -especially of those Moslems who have not yet come mder Eurooean rule.     During the Balkan Wax they both showed their sympathy for Turkey by subscribing to the Red Crescent and sending medical missions;   and they both protested in their press against the annexation of Ottoman territory by the Balkan States.   The British and Russian censorship hindered them from expressing their feelings aboit the present war through the same channel;   but what the Indian Moslems fe*l may be inferred from what the Russian Moslems have said and written since the Revolution has made the press in Russian free and oublic meetings possible.The Moscow Congress in May,&apos; in a sitting devoted to the discussion of its attitude towards the War, passed the following resolution :-&quot;Peace should be concluded without annexations or indemnities, on the basis of the right of selfedetermination for all nations living in Europe, Asia and Africa.   All secret treaties and con-ventions signed by the Allied Powers should be made public.   All treaties founded on the division or occupation of any territory in Europe, Asia or Africa must&apos;be cancelled at once&quot;.Injpther words, the Russian Moslems endorsed the peace-formula of the Russian Revolution on condition that it should be applied not only to Europe but to the East, and they fell out over this with Kerensky&apos;8 Government.     After the proclamation of an Italian protectorate over Albania, the Moslem Executive Committee at Moscow published in the Russian Press an open letter to It. Tereschenko, at that time Russian ^Sinister for Foreign Affairs :-
&quot;The fate of Albania recalls that of Algeria, Tunis, Egypt,Morocco, Afghanistan and other Moslem countries....... whose historyarouses a strong sentiment of sympathy in the hearts of the many millions of free Moslems in Russia.......&quot;The fate of Albania is a new illustration of European robbery in the history of Imperialism, and again the victim is a mainly Moslem people.......&quot;The Executive Committee expected from you a definite and un-compromising policy towards the Albanian problem.     But, alas, that hope has not been fulfilled.......&quot;The Russian Democracy was entitled to expect from you a declara-tion of the Albanian people!s right to political self-determination in such a way as not to leave any occasion for doubt.&quot;Only such a policy could insoire the Ail-Russian Moslem Council with confidence that the men responsible for the high authority of the Russian Revolution correspond to that great formula in problems of foreign as well as internal policy,&quot;Your dubious and indecisive attitude towards the Albanian problem rouses suspicion and doubt among the Moslems of Russia, particularly in consequence of those bitter experiences of centuries past, during which Moslems all the world over have learnt the meaning of what is called European justice&quot;.Still fiercer resentment was aroused by the Entente policy to-wards Turkey, for though Kerensky&apos;s Government had renounced this policy on RussiaTs part, it had not, in the opinion of the Russian Moslems, exercised sufficient pressure in this direction upon the Allies.     The Russian Moslems, quite correctly, regarded -Great Britain as.being now the chief menace to the integrity of the Ottoman Empire.     Their anti-British feelings were revealed, in August 1917, in an article published in a Tatar paper at Kasan and reproduced in the Baku press.     The occasion was a rumour that the Turks had
inflicted a crushing defeat on us and retaken Baghdad and Kut.   The comment was as follows:-&quot;With the fall of Baghdad, the Turks were in danger of being cut off from the rest of the Moslem world, and the prestige of Turkey suffered greatly in the eyes of Moslems.   The event produced a formidable echo, in India, Persia and Afghanistan........&quot;It wes very desirable for England, who dominattsjthe world, to swallow this delicious morsel too.   England was vitally interested in keeping Mesopotamia in her hands, in order to protect India against Turco-Oerman attacks and prevent the reorganisation of Turkey .as well as that of Persia.......&quot;This Turkish success in Mesopotamia will cost England dear.    It will strengthen the political position of Turkey in 2urope and the East, and will have a reaction upon India and Egypt in particular&quot;.The dissatisfaction of the Russian Moslems found its most conscious expression in a speech delivered by Ahmed Tsalikov (one of the mod-erates, representing the point of view of Kazan) at the Conference of Nationalities which met at Kiev in September 1917 under the auspices of the Ukrainian Rada.   TsalikAv began by reading a telegram of con-gratulation to the All-Russian Moslem Council from the Stockholm &quot;Indiska National-Komitteen&quot;.   He reviewed the relations between the Russian Government and the Moslems since the Revolution, and the grie-vances of the latter.    &quot;Although&quot;, he said, &quot;it is not yet clear what face the Revolutionary Democracy will show towards the East, its atti-tude towards us at least is quite clear, and that is a negative attitude&quot;The Revolutionary Government&quot;, he continued, &quot;is not frvourable to the Moslems, and the Moslems, like the Parties of the Eeft, demand the transference of supreme power to the Soviets,because they are convinced that in the provinces the Moslems have only one ally, and that is the Proletariat&quot;.A few weeks after this declaration the Bolsheviks came into power.
?.     The Russian Moslems and the Bolsheviks.The Bolsheviks began to bid at once for the support of the All-RuBsian Moslem Movement.This was an obvious step from the point of view of Real-Polltik.     Finding the Ukraine against them, it was essential that they should win over the next strongest non-Russian Q:roup in Russia to their side.     And from the gro-graphical-strategical point of view it was important to isolate their southern opponents - the Ukrainians, Don, Kuban and Terek Cossacks, and Armenians *- from the Orenburg Cossaoke and the Siberian Provisional Government, who are opposing their authority in the north-east.     If these join faroee, the Bol-sheviks will be cut off from all souroes of supplies;   at present the Bolshevltos divide them by maintaining a preoarious hold on Astrakhan and Baku, which at any moment they may lose; but if the Moslems throw in their lot with them they oan save the situation, for the bulk of the Moslem population in Russia lives between the two rebellious areas, and the trunk lines Rostov-Baku, Samara-Tashkend and the Irans-Siberian Railway pass at vital points through the Moslem territory.But the entente between Moslems and Bolsheviks is founded on something more than opportunism.    The Bolsheviks act in the name of the European labouring class, which has everywhere been ruled from above, until it became &quot;self-determining&quot;, and even dominant, in Russia, under the Bolshe-vik regime.     The Bolshevik policy is to bring about the sameorrevolution in other countries too, and naturally the wakers in these oountries - in Germany and elsewhere - feel a oertain sympathy with Bolshevik designs.    This vast, instinotive, hardly formulated international support is the Bolsheviks1 strength.    But the Islamic consciousness behind the All-Russian Moslem movement is a force of precisely the same kind.     The Moslems of Russia, like the Russian labouring class, are anxious to &quot;make Russia safe&quot; tor the rights they have won and to win the same rights for their brothers in
\J   .     .     ... - - -    -the rest of the world.    And what is more important, they believe themselves to be face to face with the same enemy -namely, &quot;Capitalism&quot;, or in other v/ords the European kiddle Class/1^ which they regard as the exploiter of the labouring class in jjurope and of the Moslems in t e East.     Scratch the Tartar and you find the Bolshevik,    The entente between these two for- oes in Russia is likely to be a lasting phenomenon, which will have an effect outside the Russian frontiers.The Bolsheviks have already done almost everything that the Russian Moslems demand,(a) They have published the secret treaties, particularly those relating to the acquisition of Constantinople and the Straits by Russia and the partition of Asiatic Turkey and Persia.(b) On December 6th, 1917, they sent out a manifesto by wireless &quot;To All the Labouring-class Moslems of Russia and the East&quot;, to the following effect&quot;At the head of the devolution is the Workraen&apos;s and Peasants1 Government of Russia, the Council of the people&apos;s Commissaries.     All Russia is covered by Councils of Workmens&apos;, soldiers1 and Peasants&apos; Deputies.     The authority in the ooun-try belongs to the people.    The waking-people of Russia are animated by the desire to secure an honest peace and to help all oppressed peoples in the world to obtain their freedom.&quot;In this holy undertaking Russia is not alone.

In this work of worl^trenovation we are expecting your sympathy and your help&quot;,(o)     fc Article      of the armistice concluded on December 15th, 1917, at Brest-Litovsk, it was declared that, &quot;starting from the principle of the freedom, independence, and terri-torieA integrity of a neutral Persian Empire, the Supreme Army Commands of Turkey and Russia are ready to withdraw their troops from Persia, and will shortly enter into communication with the Persian Government.&quot;(d)     In Article III. of the proposals presented by the Russians as a basis for peace-negotiations, it was laid
9o.ll2odown that &quot;Peoples not independent are to have the right to decide their future by means of the referendum.     This right is to be granted to all small weak peoples, apart from any question of the date of annexation, the degree of civilisa-tion of tho nation annexed, or the position of the territory in or out of Europe&quot;.In these acts and declarations the Bolsheviks have responded literally to the demands formulated by the Russian Moslems in the Open Letter to Teroschenko and in Q?salikovrs September speech at Kiev.     And the Islamic consciousness, hard-ly articulate and almost impotent hitherto, has noe behind it the force of the Bolshevik Government, to give it expression and effect.
The Islamic Consciousness.In one sense this Islamic consciousness is no new thing.   Islam - a simplified version of Christianity lagging half a millennium behind its prototype - is still in the stage of Christianity in the Kiddle Ages, when it was the strongest bond of union between.those who professed it.     In this sense, Islam has never ceased to create a personal religious fellowship between Moslem and Moslem, whether White or Black, Arab or Turk. But this religious fraternity is only the raw material of the political consciousness here in question, and that consciousness is a recent growth.   Its ap pearance can almost be dated.     In 1882, for example, when England occupied Egypt, it was a question between a discredited Oriental autocrat and an Oriental military usurper of the old type, the political parties in England, and the European Powers.     Islamic public opinion, if it existed, was not strong enough to be felt as a factor in the case. But when Great Britain concluded the Persian Agreement with Russia in 1907, a conscious wave of resentment ran through the Hoslem world, which was more effective, on the whole, than the dissatisfaction of Germany in preventing the ultimate partition of Persia from being accepted as inevitable.     It was remarkable, too, that this Islamic feeling overrode the difference between Sunni and Shia, which previously had rather isolated Persia from most other Moslem countries.    It may be said, then, that the Islamic political consciousness came Into existence during these twenty-five years.Its manifestation at the time of the Balkan War has been referred to already.    It was next put to the proof in the present war by the Intervention of Turkey, and some people have questioned its seriousness on the ground that the &quot;Holy War&quot; proclaimed &quot;by
(- r.&quot;the Ottoman Sheikfc-ul-lelam In the Caliph&apos;S name has been a fiasco among the Hcslem populations under European rule. Yet their failure to take action does not prove absence of feeling, and even violent feeling&apos;, on their pact.   Documents like the Allies^ answer to President Wilson&apos;s Note at the end of 1916 did not produce action among the European nationalities subject to Austria-Hungary, though they are indisputably anxious to escape from Austro-HungarlajLJ?ule.   In each case, no deubt, inertia, established pelitical tradition, and certain evident merits-^f^iJae--eoeieting regime are c^tri&amp;utorr-motives, but the main deterrent in both cases is rn^ro likely to be the overwhelming power of the Government in possession, the distance from any of the war-zones, the impossibility of obtaining material help from outside, and the consequent hopelessness of ,armed rebellion.It is not, indeed, likely that the Moslems under European rule will at any proximate date demand absolute self-determination for themselves.   The two most important sections of them, the Russian Moslems and the Indian Moslems, are both minorities scattered among a much larger non-Moslem population, and geography in their case precludes a programme of territorial independence.     The Russian Moslems, who are their own masters now, are not claiming this, but only relative self-determination within the Russian State, and the Moslems In India, Egypt, Tripoli and French North-Africa, though they will almost certainly raise their demands to the Russian level, will hardly go beyond.But though they are not inclined to be revolutionary in their interpretation of self-determination in their own case, they are as little prepared to compromise In the oase cf Moslems who have hitherto been exempt from European rule,   When their Islamic
consciousness has been roused, as it was in 1907, 1911, 1912-3, it has not been over internal questions between themselves and their European Governments, but over the addition of further territories inhabited by - or ruled by - Moslems to the European domain.Since the conclusion of the Anglo-French and Anglo-Russian Ententes the &quot;enclosure&quot; of free Hoslem lands by European Empires has proceeded at an accelerated   pace, and at the out-break of war the only independent Moslem countries left were Turkey, Afghanistan and Persia.   Of these Persia and Afghanistan were already on the road to absorption by the British Empire and Russia, and had not the vitality in themselves to resist the process.   Turkey alone was in the true sense an independent &apos; Moslem Power, and the War now threatens Turkey&apos;s integrity and independence as well.Islamic public opinion passionately demands &quot;self-determination&quot; for this last independent Moslem area.   That means in the first place that the European control in process gf establishment over parts of these territories must be given up, and that no portion of what now belongs to Turkey, Afghanistan and Persia must be added - by annexation, protectorate, or nominally equal alliance - to any of the existing Oriental Empires belonging to European Powers.   Moslem opinion is most in earnest about this negative side of its demand, but it also has decided views about the positive political organisation of these countries if the negative condition is secured and their immunity from European penetration guaranteed.   There is little doubt that It is in general sympathy with the C.U.P.Ts war-aims of internal independence and territorial integrity for the Ottoman Empire; that It wishes to see Turkey emerge from the war as a Great Powerj   and that It would like to see Turkey1s power extended, and
the exclusion of Europe frem Persia and Afghanistan confirmed, by an entente of the two latter States with Turkey that would virtually place them under Ottoman hegemony.It may he objected that this would not be &quot;self-determination&quot; at all;   that Persia would sink into the same relation towards Turkey as Austria-Hungary towards Germany;   and that the third war-aim of the C.U.P., which is &quot;Turcification&quot; within the Ottoman frontiers and the attraction towards Turkey of &quot;Turanian&quot; populations outside, is a direct negation of &quot;self-determination&quot; for non-Turkish Moslem nationalities.   It would, in fact, expose the Ottoman firabs to the same fate as the Armenians and Greeks, and crush the Persians between the Turanian masses in Anatolia, Central Asia, the Caucasus and Azerbaijan.   But Meslem opinion is not affected by this argument.   It is idle to explain that its programme implies racial war in Turkey and anarchy in Persia, and that it is imposing on these Moslem countries a very different future from that which it desires in its own case.   For this Moslem policy is almost deliberately inconsistent.   Where Moslems are subject to Europeans, it demands the &quot;self-determination&quot; of the Moslem populations;   but where they are under Moslem Government, it prefers the &quot;self-determination&quot; of the Moslem States.     It believes that the existence of large, independent, military Moslem States is essential to the politicalyprogress of the Islamic world as a whole, and if this involves the sacrifice of one or two Moslem nationalities, it feels that this satrifice is justified for the sake of the common cause.This point of view is illustrated by the feeling of Russian and Indian Moslems towards the Arab Movement and King Hussein. They regard the Arabs, much as we do the Bulgars, as people who, to further their private aims, have betrayed a higher cause.
mmmminf IThey refuse to discuss whether these alms are just in themselves; they assert a priori that nothing can justify the Break-up by Moslems of the last independent Moslem Power.   They only excuse the Arabs in so far as they were led away by King Hassein -the Tsar Perdinard of Islam - and they explain Hussein&apos;s fall from grace by the wiles of the tempter England.   Their feeling Is so bitter that all. allusion to the revolt of the Hejaz has to be carefully avoided in the Allies&apos; Moslem propaganda; and King Hussein himself, in his proclamation of independence, which is throughout an apologia, has to subscribe to the dogma of the Holy Ottoman State:-&quot;It is well known that of all Moslem rulers the Emirsof Mecca were the first to recognise the TurkishGovernment.&quot;This they did in order to unite Moslem opinion and firmly establish their conwtunity. knowing that the great Ottoman Sultans (may the dust of their tombs be blessed and may ParaN^e     be their abode) were acting in accordancd with the Book of God and the Sunna of /his Prophet.......&quot;I myself, protecting the honour of the State, caused Arabs to rise against their fellow-Arabs (on two specifiedyoccasions). ...&quot;The Emirs continued to support the Ottoman State until the C.U.P. appeared In the State and proceeded to take over the administration thereof and all its affairs, with the result that the State suffered a loss of territory which quite destroyed its prestige, as the whole worldloiows, and was plunged into the horrors of war and broughts,to its present perilous position, as vf patent to all&quot;,
..0.&apos; - .118In other words, King Hussein only defends himself for weakening Turkey1s position as a Great Power by representing that the mischief had been dcfejij by the C.U.P already.     And when Mr Balfour&apos;s letter to Lord Rothschild foreshadowed the first positive alienation of Moslem soil to non-Moslems by the act of the Allies, he could not bring himself to congratulate the British Government on the capture of Jerusalem, though he was by that time absolutely committed to his alliance with us,   So strong is the Moslem public opinion of which King Hussein has to take account, and to which he is probably not impervious himself.
2.7.119The Problem.for Great BritainIn 1907 the policy of Germany in Europe made an entente with Russia a paramount necessity for the British Empire;   the price was the Persian Agreement;   and in paying it we sacrificed our traditional entente with Islam.    Moslem extremists talk about &quot;the betrayal of Islam to the Tsardom by England and France.&quot;  We ourselves represent our action as due, not to any change of senfi-ment or voluntary reversal of policy Jrowards Islam, but simply to the force majeuro of Our rapproohement with Russia.(1)In the secret treaties published by the Bolsheviks, theBritish Entente with Russia was oarriod to its logical conclusion,Moslem feeling about these documents will only be able to find ex-pression in the Moslem Preea in Russia, and the issues of sufficient-ly recent date are not yet to hand.     But it may be assumed apriori that the effect on Moslem opinion will be extremely unfavour-able.    The RusBian Memorandum recording the agreements betweenRussia, Groat Britain and France, when taken in conjunction withits corollary, the Sykes-Pioot Agreement, practically partitionsPersia between Russia and Great Britain, and the Arab lands be-tween Groat Britain and France, as well, ae Armenia between Franooand Russia.    Prom the British point of view, the most unfortunatefeature is the assignment of tho neutral zone of Persia to C-reatBritain by Russia in exchange for the recognition by Great Britainf2)ef Russia!s claims to the Straits and Const ant inoplo;   and the(l)      Izvestia ef the Potrograd O.W.S.B., fiov 23rd 1917.(2)     An arrangement whioh Koslem opinion will regard in the same light as the Germans do the free hand given by Russia to France in the redrawing of Germanyxs Western frontiers, in exchange for a freo hand for Russia on the east.
craising of the ouestion of Northern Afghanistan involves the third of the last three ir^lependenfc Moslem States in the Middle Eastern area,The British stipulation in favour of the protection of theHoly Places and the independence of Arabia^will hardly offset thisunfavourable impression - firstly because the Arab Movement is lookodw primarily by other Moslems as a device for the dismemberment ofTurkey;   and secondly beeause the stipulation may be read as implyingthat all independent Moslem territories not covered by It are in fact(2)to be divided up among the Allied Powers, whioh is the very contingency that Moslem opinion leathes and fears.    Tho ouestion of the Caliphate, whiah was also raised in the Russian Memorandum, has, it is true, beon disposed of by Lord Robert Cecils statement in the House of Commons, m November 30th, 1917, that &quot;His Majesty1s Government have never de-parted from the attitude that the ouestion of the Caliphate is one for Moslem opinion alone to decide&quot;    At the same time, this is in some sort an admission of the right of self-determination for the whole Islamic world, since the Caliphate, in Moslem tradition, is not a spiritual but a temporal power.Great Britain, then, is incurring the full odium of the entente with Russia at the moment when the policy on whioh it was founded has broken down through the Russian Revolution and the repudiation of the(1)      The inhabitants of this region are Turks, and the hint of Russian designs on thorn will be dangerous material for Pan-Turanian propaganda among them - a propaganda whioh under these circumstances would be received more favourably than before by the Afghan Government.(2)      JuBt as the phrase:   &quot;It has never been the intention of the Allies to seek the extermination or the political extinction of the Germanic peoples,n which occurred in the Allied Governments Reply to President Wilson at the end of 1916, was interpreted in Germany as meaning that every injury short of this was intended by us.
121CTsarist aims by the Bolsheviks.     We arc in danger of drawing upon our own heads the TsardomTs whole heritage of hatred in the Moslem world, and at the same time seeing Russia and Islam both go over to Germany^ camp, though the course of the War has shown us how much we need both of them on our side against her.    The situation in Russia and Turkey, which between them occupy tho land-bridge between Europe and the East, is in flux, and for the moment we can only count upon a friendly island here and thero - Armenians, Georgians, Cossacks and a doubtful Ukraine.    By using those pieds-a-terro, we may save something from the general debacle;   but it is submitted that Revolutionary Russia (which is Bolshevik and likely to remain so) and politioally conscious Islam are the two main factors in the situation, and that iS our policy is not based on an entente with these, the whole land-bridge is bound to pass out of our influence and come ultimately under some form of German control.An entente with both is all the more necossary if, as was suggested in a previous section of this Memorandum, Bolshetism and the liOBlem Movement are gravitating towards one another.    But the question of policy towards the Bolsheviks is quite outside the scope of this Memorandum, which is only concerned with our relations with Islam.The problem for British policy is raised in a practical form by the elimination of rlussia from the Middle Eastern sphere.    This absolutely destroys the status quo, and leaves ub with three alter-nativee to follow:-(l)   \7e may step into Russia1 s shoes, and carry on the Anglo-Ruseian policy of 1907 single-handed.    In the military sense it may be necessary to do this during the War, but the raising ef the military problem has already shown that it involves taking on res-ponsibilities up to the Cauoasus, and possibly up to the Don, the Yolga and the Trans-Siberian Railway.     As a permanent policy after
m^the-Tfar-thl^TOnl^^ infinite would appear to be beyondthe strength of the British Empire;   and even if we had the material resouroesm we oould only make it at the oost of embittering Moslem public opinion, and Jeopardising our goed relations with Egypt and India at their most difficult stage.    The probable hostility of Bolshevik Russia, and tho ease with which the German enemy could sow tares in this vast and ill-fenced field, increase the diffi-     t culty of such an undertaking.But if this alternative is ruled out as a permanent policy, it might be advisable to preface any temporary military action we contemplate taking in this direction by some explicit declaration that this is not intended to be a precedent for the future after the War.    Some such declaration would incidentally facilitate our military action on its political side, especially in Persia, through which our communications with the^aucasua-and Jbeyond jaust run,(S)   But if wo undertake to stand out of this area ourselves -or in other words, to satisfy the negative side of the Moslem demand that no more independent Moslem territory shall fall under European control as a result of tho War - the ouestion remains of what regime is to reign there hereafter.It has been mentioned above that Moslem opinion would prefer that Sharks y should retain her integrity and emerge as a great power, at liberty to extend her influence, by Pan-Islamio and Pan-Turanian propaganda, over Persia and Afghanistan, which would ex hypothesi be &quot;placed out of bounds * for European Powers,Skis solution would of course be intolerable to us.     In the first place, we could not abandon to Turkish vengeance the Hejaz and Irak Arabs, the Jewish colonist a in Palestine, the Lebanese, and the Armenians, to whom we are pledged, not to speak of other oppressed populations towards whom wo are under no specific obli-gation.    And in the second place, if not only the Ottoman Empire but Persia and Afghanistan were made ovor as a political preserve
to the C.U.P., their activities- would not stop at these limits, hut would inevitably extend into India and Russia.    in this case, as in the first there would be friction between us and the Moslem world, and sabotage against the British Empire in Egypt and India.(J3)  The remaining alternative is to find some trustee for the area ooverea by the non-Turkish territories of the Ottoman Empire, as well as Persia and Afghanistan, who would be acceptable both tk British interests and to Moslem public opinion.    The function of suoh a trustee would be to reconstruct this area with a view to the ultimate &quot;self-determination&quot; of the peoples it contains - whether Christian or Moslem, Arab or Persian or Turanian - while keeping it free impartially from Turoo-Serman penetration on the one side and Franco-British penetration on the other.    The trusteeship might conceivably be administered in the name of a League of Nations.This leads up to a conclusion suggested, in another connection, in a previous memorandum on &quot;The Turkish Attitude towards Peace&quot; -that the only satisfactory solution in this part of the world is to be fotqid in the intervention of the United States.No doubt it would not satisfy the Germans.    They would take it as proving their theory of an^Anglo-Saxon conspiracy against the world But from our own point of view there could be no arrangement better calculated to cement the Anglo-Amerioan Alliance, which, as far as the narrower &quot;state-interests&quot; of the British Stapire are concerned, is perhaps the one consideration in the War which is as important as the recovery of the good-will of Islam.    And what is most to the point, this solution has some chance of finding favour with Moslem opinion.A German may regard England and America as to all intents and purposes the same, but in the eyes of Moslems they are something verydifferent.England, to the Moslem world, appears as the mistress of tho
greatest European Oriental empire;   she has constantly increasedthis empire at the expense of independent Moslem States;   and shehas ended by deliberately allying herself with the Russian Tsardom,whioh has been Islam1 s arob-enemy for hundreds of years.    Englandmay still be forgiven by the Koslems if she cries &quot;peecavi,&quot; but shemust give practical proof of repentance, and if she takes anotherfoot of independent Moslem land, whether by opon or veiled annexa-tion, she will stand condemned for ever in their opinion.America on the other hand enjoys the advantage - enjoyed by(1)Germany too and effectively exploited by her during the *var -   ofnever having had any Oriental Ffcb$eots.    There is no suppressionof the Indian Mutiny in her record, no Occupation of Egypt, no Per-Eian Agreement, no Entente with the Tsar.    America is typified inPersia by Mr. jorgan Shuster, the man who tried to set Persia on herfeet and was driven out by the Tsar8s agents;   in the Ottoman Empireshe Is typified by the Missionaries, the only Westerners who havenot come there for ulterior political ends.    As far as successdepends upon public opinion, the Americans would thus have an ex-cellent start;   and their previous tradition in these countries would lead them instinctively to reconstruct from within, and not to administer from above.    Boubtless their work would lack the technical efficiency of the British cffioisl, trained on centuries of experience;   but precisely the tradition in which this experience IS amto&amp;iea night be fetal to success owing to its present assooia-tions in the Moslem mind.    It is a case for balancing administra-tive efficiency end political feeling against one another;   and it is the contention of this Memorandum that tho idea of &quot;self-doter-mination&quot; for Orientals has become to this extent a reality to be reckoned with - thivt in future the political consciousness of our Oriental subjects will be a more important factor for us to con-sider than the ideal development of our own administrative machine.(1)   Tho iloshi Proclamation is almost tho only woak spot, from the propagandists point of viow, in GormanyTs ; oslom policy. It shows what blunders Germany would have committed if she had hod more scope.
1*    Conclusions.fi)     In the Empires belonging to the Western European democracies, there has so far been a recognised distinction between the rights of Europeans and Oriontals, based on their geographical separation.(ii)   During the War the Gorman Propaganda has tried to obscure this distinction, but without success.(iii)   In Turkey and Russia, Europeans and Orientals livo together without any sharp geographical division, but before the war, conditions there had little effect on the general problem of the relations between Europe and the Bast.(iv) Since the V/ar, Turkey and Russia have become tho do-termining factors in tho problem.    Germany has recognised the &quot;right of self-determination&quot; for the Turks, and Great Britain for the Arabs, in the Ottoman Empire;   while the nineteem million Moslems of Russia have organised themselves since the Revolution on democratic lines.(v) There are many points in common between the Russian Moslem Movement and the radian - the most important being an extrome sensitiveness to the fate of Moslems in other ooun-tries.    The Russian Movement is definitely hostile towards British policy regarding Turkey - so much so that it quarrel-led with Ecrensky&apos;s Government as beinv too complacent towards the supposed War-Aims of the Allies.fvi)     The Bolsheviks have made every possible bid to win over (a) the Moslem Movement in Russia, and (b) the public opinion of the Moslem v/orld - partly for immediate strategical reasons in their struggle with the Ukraine, the Cossacks and Siberia;   partly because both they and the Russian Moslems believe that European labour and the Oriental subjects of
European empires are fighting the same enemy - namely &quot;Capitalism&quot;, or the European Middle Class.(vii)    The l8lamio oonsciousness, like the European Labour Movement, is a growing international force.     It first made itself felt on the occasion of the Persian Agreement in 1907, and it is now passionately demanding thot the principle of &quot;No Annexations&quot; (neither &quot;opem&quot; nor &quot;veiled&quot;) shall be applied to gurkey, Persia and Afghanistan.Jyiii)   The problem for British Policy is set by the d^mteu%*on of Russia from this area, which entirely destroys the status quo on which our policy has been based sin?e 1907.In 1907 we sacrificed our traditional entente with Islam to the necessity of making one with Russia.    Since the Tsar&amp;om has been replaced by the Bolsheviks, Russia has re-pudiatod this policy, and is making an entente with the Moslems hersoif.     It is a question now of winning back both Russia and Islam to our side, or seeing them both go over together into the German camp.There are three alternatives before usL-(a) To carry on the policy of 1907 single-handed.This is probably beyond our strength, and would estrange Islam and Russia.(b) To stand out of this area and leave it to Germany and the C.U.P.    The Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turanian Movements directed from Constantinople make this impossible.fb)     To find a trustee for these countries acceptable to both parties.     This could only be the United States.10. 1. 18.
