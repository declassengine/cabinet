hi9 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY IS  QTrSHHMEKTI.57/G .N ./7043 . SECRET..&apos; G.T. 3558. WAR CABINET-.:SALVAGE. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.with reference to G.T. 3082,  3279,  3338 and 3345, I circu late a memorandum with a covering minute by Mr. Andrew Weir, Surveyor General of Supply.    The memorandum was prepared by Mr Weir and sent by me semi-officially on 7th January to the Minister cf Munitions, the President of the Local Government Board, the president of the Board of Agriculture and the Food Controller with a request for their co-operation.(Sgd.)    DERBY.16th January, 1918.&apos;MINUTE ^J^^^^QRJSSS^^^ - SUPPLY TO THE -&amp;gCH%TARYr OP-..SV \VE ^FOR. ffiARvThe scheme submitted to you on the 5th instant has been approved by the President of the Board of Agriculture and,, subject to discussion of certain details,, by the President of the Local Government Board.In the meantime a somewhat similar proposal has been laid, before the war Cabinet by the Food Confcrc.ll.er who deals with the question more particularly from the Food point of view (G -.T-.3279)\    His proposals refer principally to the utilisation of waste products arising in connection with the preparation and consumption of food but extend also to waste material generally, and he cites the results obtained by Army Waste Products Ltd., as an example of what can be done in the direction indicated.There is nothing in his proposals which is not entirely covered by our larger scheme under which it was intended that the Food Controller, Who would be represented on the Council, should have complete control of any recovered material which could be converted or reserved for edible purposes.All the Departments interested agree that in order to prevent overlapping it is essential that one Department should be charged with the responsibility of salvage in all its rarni-fications and the suggestion that Civil Salvage should be managed under the same control as Army Salvage v/ith the co-operation of other Departments interested appears to offer the best prospects of co-ordination of effort in converting waste material into useful produce.(Sgd.) ANDREW WEIR.&apos;
NATIONAL WASTE PRODUCTS LIMITED.It is desirable that steps should be taken Immediately to co-ordinate the efforts which are new being made by individual Government Departments to conserve end return to circulation as serviceable, material which has hither W eitherH^een Yeg*a*i**.-s^ &quot;waste&quot; or disposed of in a &quot;wasteful&quot; manner .;The objects are obvious , but may be briefly stated as fellows      -By rendering serviceable for National requirements material which has hitherto been regarded as waste or has been thoughtlessly wasted ,(1)    To reduce the quantity of new raw material which . would otherwise require to be imported.(2)    To release tonnage for the import of Food and other essentials which from their nature cannot be salved as raw material end re-used .(3)    To increase the supply of raw materials which, apart from the tonnage difficulties have become scarce in the World&apos;s markets.(4)   To procure raw material as cheaply as possible as regards first cost, transport, handling, and distribution .The term raw material is used in its widest sense..It is impossible and unnecessary to enumerate all the &quot;waste&quot; material which would come into the scope of the proposed scheme, but as examples we may cite cloth, leather, paper, vegetable and animal refuse, china, glass, earthenware, and scrap^ metals such as iron, old tins, copper, zinc, lead, etc.Already individual effort has succeeded in rescuing from the rubbish heap a small portion of all the above materials hlvhar^C&apos;  wasted and by sorting and proper treatment rendered it again serviceable for material needs .Co-ordination will Increase enormously the value of these efforts , and co-ordinated enquiry and research, will develop fresh channels along which further combined efforts can be economically applied .This, however, requires organisation and proper direction,On a small scale a considerable amount of success has been achieved in the direction indicated, by a small branch Department created by the Army Council and embodied in the form of &quot;Army Waste Products Ltd.&quot;, a Government owned Corporation formed to deal with what was previously regarded as &quot;Waste&quot; arisin in connection with Army Camps etc.   &apos;It
DetailsIt is novr-tnwpoeed to expand the scope of this Institution sc as to -bring within the range of its activities the larger problems of civil and industrial &quot;waste&quot;.The name of the Company-*&amp;-lll be changed to National- Waste Products Ltd., which will be a tkrv^Wfte^ inevery respect on strict commercial lines, managed by an ExaxnrtA-TO, Board of Directors representing  -both the Army and the Civil sidOj debitted with all the ordinary charges of a private or public corporation.It is also proposed to form in connection with the &apos; Company an Advisory Council, on which every...Government,JDepartment in any way interested -would be represented, who would at all times be kept fullv informed of the progress of operations and when necessary would consider and decide on any question of precedence or urgency raised by the representative of any Department and generally as tc the wisdom of any   action taken or proposed to be taken by the Executive.The functions of the Institution would be very clearly defined so as to prevent any misunderstanding as to it3 responsibiliti es,In particular it should be made perfectly clear that the establishment of this organisation does not in the slightest degree relieve any Department, Municipality, Public or Private Corporation or individuls from their present responsibilities as regards the care, collection and disposal of waste,The functions of National Waste Products Ltd., will be:-(1) To co-ordinate, advise, suggest, encourage, and if necessary, direct the operations of public and private enterprises, having for their object the prevention of waste, the recovery of raw material and or the utilization of waste products; and only to themselves engage in such enterprises fa) when Authorities or individuals are unable or unwilling from th&amp; nature or circumstances of the case to underi.aXe the r.eoponuibility (b) whon it is considered necessary or advisable to put. ?\p more or less experimental plants to demonstrate any new or improved process (c) when it is considered that any public or private enterprises are not being conducted to the best advantage from a national point of view (d) when the urgent needs for any particular class of material call for drastic action in any particular direction.,(2) To supervise and where necessary control and providefor the disposal either of waste material cr the productsderived therefrom; and in this connection to regulate prices in a fair and reasonable manner.(3) Tc continually prosecute research work either directly or by co-ordination of the various Research Laboratories throughout the Kingdom.(4) To regulate all questions of transport labour and priority in connection with Salvage Schemes, from the point of view 01 maximum National advantage;(5) To prepare and publish from time to time statistics showing the practical and commercial results arising from activities in various directions, wi th a view to establishing the infn^1^ t0 bG arrived by the Nation from such activitiesnot only during the continuance of the war but during the equally difficult period of demobilization and reconstructionuO IQllOW,
Details of the scheme will of course be worked ofct by the Executive Board in consultation with the Advisory Council, but the following suggestions have already been favourably considered:(l)     That the finance of the proposed Company should be provided by a small Government Loan on which the Company could draw if necessary, paying interest at the usual rates.It is hoped that the financial results of the Company&apos;b operations would soon render it independent of Government assistance.(2)     All waste material will be paid for and any profits arising after due provision has been made for depreciation amortization and reserve funds will be distributed on a proportionate basis amongst the sources from which the waste materials were derived; to be used in the case of Municipalities, etc, in relief of rates or otherwise fOr their own purposes.(3)     The business of the Company to be divided into two Sections Army and Civil, controlled by separate Managers who will however work in close co-operation, The development of the Civil side of the Company^ activities will be administered by the Principal Officer of the Waste Utilization Section recently created by the Department of Food Economy which will now with the cordial approval of the Director of that Department be merged into the National Scheme. Army Waste Products Ltd., will also be absorbed, its staff taken over to administer the Army side of the New Company.(4)     The Army Salvage Organization would be responsible for the collection of Army Waste while directions as to Civil Waste would be issued to local authorities, Municipalities,, etc, through the ordinary channels available to the Local Government Board.(5)     A special section for dealing with Industrial &quot;Waste&quot; in ita wider senBe would be set up in due course.(6)     The principal objective of the Company wil3L be toensure that the maximum qualtiy &quot;Waste&quot; is converted into &quot;products&quot; for distribution and disposal to Government Departments, etc.The Disposals Branch already operating in connection with the Army Salvage Organization would be utilized and expanded by means of a Liaison Executive Clearing House system to ensure that all waste products recovered are disposed of to the best advantage, with due regard to priority of need.(a) To Government Departments,(b) To Manufacturer^   for Industrial Needs.It is not intended that operations should immediately be developed on any large scale, but that steady and continual expansion as opportunities offer themselves along the lines alreac proved to be successful will be adopted as the present policy of the Company, *5th Januaryj 19lO.J
