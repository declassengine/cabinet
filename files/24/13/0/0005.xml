MINISTRY OP PENSIONS.REPORT FOR PERIOD FROM 5th MAY TO 11th MAY,1917.1,     The number of fresh/cases&apos; received (4702) Is 30f above the average of the last four weeks.     Since the middle of March there has &quot;been a marked growth in nhe number of fresh cases.     Last week the number was swollen by a large number of applications through Mr. Hogge.The number of cases finally dealt with is lower than for many weeks past with the exception of Easter week. The awarding officers have worked more slowly, and the Senior Officer has been exclusively occupied in checking the awards of the juniors.     The number of cases awaiting, awards (2995) is large.On the renewal side of the Office the number of $ cases dealt with is above the average.     The chief item of interest is 1224 cases of pensions re-assessed under the new Warrant without application in advance of the end of the conditional, periods.i ft% Of the 51,590 sailors and soldiers discharged as medically unfit since the Ministry took over its duties on the 15th February 81.9$ have received pensions and 7.8^ gratuities.      Of the 13,540 so discharged since the new Order in Council and Royal Warrant came into force on April 4th, 84.7$ have received pensions and 15$ gratuities.   Out of 3,000 men,who since the latter date have applied for re-consideration of refusals to pension them under previous Warrants, 367 have now been given pensions and 404 gratuities, and the remaining applications which have come in rapidly in the last few days are in hand ait various stages of consideration.
2.     The acceleration of the progress in the re* assessment of Dependants pensions (Appendix I) has continued, 21t2 cases having &quot;been disposed of during the week against 1687 last week and 1130 the previous week; but there remains 69,349 to be done.     In 662 cases this week there has been benefit by the re-assessment to the average extent of 4/- a week;   in the other cases the pensions were already equal to pre-war assess-As a result of re-examination as to supplement (Appendix II)C*  119 widows cases have been disposed of duringthe week.   Of these, 57 widows wfto had been refused pension have now been admitted under Article 15, and 62 aggravation (gratuity) cases to pension under Article 11.     No widows cases have been rejected.     156 Depend-ants have been admitted to pension or gratuity;   3 heve been finally rejected.     Only 802 cases (widows and dependants) now remain to be dealt with out of the original total of 4,523.942. grants of  3 have been authorized this week (901 Army, 41 Navy) as against 512 last week.3.     A statement with regard to the Statutory Committee for the week ending the 9th May is annexed as Appendix III.Reports have been received from the Committee&apos;s Inspectors on the work of the Local Committees of Kingston-on-Hull, Lancaster, Yorkshire East Riding, Yorkshire West Riding and Pohtefract.     In the last two cases reference is made to the unsatisfactory position of men transferred to Class W and sent home unfit for work.-   On this subject the Minister has communicated personally   tb&apos; the Secretary of State for War suggesting that Local Committees who are already empowered to make temporary advances not exoeeding14/-
14/- a week to such men who are in necessitous sircumstanees should also &quot;be enabled to pay on behalf of the War Office separation allowances to their families.Five reports have been received from Local Committees in the West of Ireland which show that these are beginning to function but that only for a comparatively few out of some 300 discharged disabled men have training or employment been found.     Some good training classes which had been provided mainly by local effort at the command depot at Tipperary are now to be stopped by War Office ^rder, the accommodation they occupied being required for military purposes; efforts are being made to start them elsewhere.At the meeting of the Special (Disablement) Sub-Committee held on the 9th instant, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Pensions Ministry was elected Chairman of the Committee.4.     The relations between the Committee on Institutional Treatment which was already under the Chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Health Section of the Disablement Sub-Committee hus been regularised by placing the former under the direction of the latter.Steps have also been taken to prevent over-lapping in the function of the Local War Pensions Committees and local branches of the Red Cross Society with regard to obtaining accommodation for paraplegics in local hospitals,, work which had been handed over to the Society by the War Office.     In the great majority of cases In which men are sent direct from military hospitals to beds in civil hospitals reserved for the Red Cross Society, the local branch of the latter will notify the Pensions Committee of the place where theinstitution
Institution is situated.     In other cases where the paraplegic is found by the Committee and they apply to the branch of the Red Cross Society that branch will see that accommodation is provided.5,     At the request of the Ministry the National Association for the prevention of consumption and other forms of tuberculosis have prepared the list of occupations suitable for discharged tuberculous soldiers which ia given in Appendix IV hereto.6,     The Minister has been asked and has agreed to receive on the 15th instant a deputation from the British Medical Association on the subject of the Medical Treatment of disabled men under the new Royal Warrant.     In the mean- . time he has taken steps to obtain closer co-operation be-tween the Medical Profession and Local War Pensions Committee,&apos;, by suggesting to them that they should get representatives of the Local Medical Committees, constituted under the National Insurance Act to sit on Disablement Sub-Committees.7.     The complete statement of the Central Registry for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers for the month of April fteceived since the submission of last week&apos;s report, shows that during that month the following numbers were admitted to the various limb fitting hospitals or discharged from them fitted with limbs;-Name of Hospital	Number admitted	Number dischargedRoehampton House	409	425Princess Louise1s Cottage Hospital	101	98CUlster Volunteer Force Hospital	10	11Princess Patricia*s Hospital, Bray	16	19Eton Hall Hostel, Kelso.	54	32	570	579Appendix

A visit paid by the Minister last week to Scotland was not referred to in the week(s report, notes with regard to it not having been received in time.On May 2nd he was present at the inaugural meeting of the Glasgow and West of Scotland War Pensions Joint Committee, a Body formed for the purpose of pre-paring and administering schemes for the care, health, training and employment of discharged disabled sailors and soldiers within the geographical area covered by the following Counties and Burghs:-    Argyll, Stirling, Dunbarton, Bute, Renfrew, Lanark, Ayr, Wigtown, Kircudbright, Dumfries, Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock. Those present included the Lord Provost, the ex Lord Provost, Sir Robert Munro and Sir Archibald Shaw. Resolutions were passed constituting an Executive with   * power to appoint necessary officials and to report as to the facilities and organisations available for th&quot;e purpose above mentioned, also as to the extent it is possible td utilise and co-operate with existing insti-tutions, organisations and authorities and generally as to the provision which is proposed to be made In the general interest of the area for the carrying but of the powers and duties of Local Committees under Section 4 of the Naval and Military War Pensions Act 1915.On
On the same day the Minister visited U&amp;k Headquarters and some of the District Offices of tb^Looe-L War Pensions Committee of the City of Glasgow and was present during the hearing of applications for assistance.On May 3rd he attended a Conference of represent-ativea of Local Committees of Northumberland, Durham, Cumberland and Westmorland., hold a&amp; the Town Hall, Newcastle-on-Tyne, the L^rd Mayor presiding.   Others present included the Earl of Durham and Sir Frank Hall. The Aftercare of disabled men was discussed and It was agreed to delegate treatment and training to a Joint Committee representing Local Committees within the Counties of Northumberland, Durham and Cumberland-, and, subject to approval, to include also the Local Committees of Middlesborough and Thornaby-on-Teea.     The representatives of YvestmortLaTji   expressed a preference for a joint action with Lancashire and it was understood that the necessary steps would be taken in that direction.Several questions o  Importance were mentioned Including the definition of &quot;Training&quot; in respect of mining occupations.   It was urged that where a disabled man returned to employment In coalmining and took up a process different from his pre-war occupation a reasonable period should be regarded as training to enable him to earn the district rate of wages for that process.   Mr. Barnes replied that each case would be considered on Its merits, but generally he thought that where a man was compelled by reason of a disability arising during service with the Colours, to enter a new occupation some period for training might be considered as within the provisions of the Warrant.Subsequently the Minister visited the RutherfordTechnical Schools and Workshops at Newcastle, also the FirstNorthern General Hospital at Gosforth-on-Tyne.     At theseInstitutions an Annexe is being provided from fundssunplied by the Llswick &amp; Scotswood Workmen&apos;s AlliedHospital.
Hospital and War Relief Funds, which Organisation has already met the cost of appliances for equipping an Orthopaedic Wing, there being, at present, no such facilities within the Northern area.In the evening the Minister addressed a large meeting of representatives of Local Committees, Trade and Labour and kindred Organisations, held in the Go-operative Hall, Darncrook.     Several speakers directed attention to. the inadequate sums payable under the new Royal Warrant in respect of children.     It was alleged that the prevailing high prices of food - notably milk - rendered it difficult for widowed mothers to provide sufficient nourishment for their children.Later the Minister received a deputation represent-ing the National Federation of Discharged Soldiers and Sail-ors, who desired to discuss the position of a pensioner who is ordered to re-join the Forces and whose conditional pension expires during his further service.     The Minister replied that no further claim to pension could arise during service with the Colours.9.     Arrangements have been made for the Minister to visit Ireland in the week commencing the 21st Instant to preside over meetings for &amp;he setting up of Joint Committees for Treatment and. Training.     The partition of Ireland into districts for the purpose has presented seme difficultre it being undesirable on political grounds to the other-wise convenient division between Ulster and the rest of Ireland.     It. is now proposed to have three districts corresponding to the Military Commands with centres at Dublin, Belfast and Cork.       This puts the nine counties of Ulster and County Louth in Leinster together as the Northern District.   The Midland District will include, Dublin, Meath, Kildare, Wicklow, West Meath, Kings County, Queens County, Carlow and Longford in the Province of Leinster and Leitrim, Sligo, Rosscommon, Mayo and Galwayin
iri the province of Connaugjit.     The southern District will comprise (   Pexford, Kilkenny and Vaterfor-d in Leinster and Tipperary, Clare Limerick, Cork and Kerry in Punster.10.   Luring the current week an Inter-Allied Conference on the treatment and training of the disabled soldier was held in Paris. The Finistry of Pensions were represented by the following:-Lieutenant-Colonel fir Arthur Griff ith-Boscawen,M.F. (Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry).Lieutenant-Colonel P,A.&quot;tanton (Secretary to the War Pensions u.c. statutory Committee) .Colonel Sir Berkeley Poynihan hi.,L.B. ,F,R,C.S. ,k,A,k.C.(Professor of Clinical Surgery, University of Leeds).rajor Robert Mitchell (Adviser to the Hinister of Pensions with regard to training of disabled men).Sir Charles Nicholson Bart.II.I&apos;. (Chairman of the (Disablement)&apos; Sub-Committee of the London Par J ens ions Committee).Lord Charnwood.A report of the proceedings will be submitted under next week13 statement.11.    Table I shows that 6,012 new pensions, including children&apos;s allowances wore granted dur. ng the week, against 10,975 in the previous week, the awards to soldiers still being slowed down in consequence of inexperience of the awarding, officers in the provisions ol&apos; the new . arrant.     Since the beginning of the   ar up to the 9th instantp 625,G91 pensions, including children1s allowances, have been granted.Table II shows that last week (.6 grants of supplementary pensions and children&apos;s allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 75 in the previous week and that the total number to date is 3770.
12.   Table III shows a slight increase in the female staff of all branches of the Ministry.   There are now 175 men and 2,745 women employed or 2920 in all.   The staff of the Statutory Committeo oomprises 100 men and 166 women or 266 in all, bringing the grand total to 5186.There has been slight alteration in the sick absence percentage of the female staff - at Tate Gallery from 6.8 to 6.7, at Chelsea from 5.5 to 5.9 and at the Pensions Issue Office from 7.5 to 6.7.     The total daily percentage of absences from the Ministry was 4.1 among the male and 6.5 among the female staff, the lowest yet recorded.M.N.11th May, 1917.

Extracts from Report   of Inspectors of Accounts, etc,ENGLAND.Kingston-on-Kull Local Committee.Disabled Men.     1500 cases have been investigated and I should say adequately dealt with.       Only two have applied for training and these were considered very unsuitable cases. The Register, through stress of work, has not been started yet.Lancaster Local Committee *Diuablid mm du wer* find mevli oo iggcudiily am    if anna frut tho LoaoiJi Commit too has &quot;bo sin ouTdIc to gut miplujiiiiLiili Punaovernal.

I saw some of their work which was well done.East Riding Local Committee.Disabled Men.     The Register is complete up to date and contains the names of 222 men.     Nearly all agricultural cases.     A scheme for training limited to this area is not considered quite practicable.     The men generally prefer to &quot;exist&quot; on their pensions rather than train.     Think they have done their bit,&quot; etc., and earned retirement.      (This is the report I get).     Suitable employment has been found for every case willing to work-Pontefact Sub-Committee*Discharged Men.     Only few cases notified to date and very little llelp has been necessary.     Much trouble, however, has Veen given by Class W. men, sent home totally unfit for work.West Riding Local Committee.The Secretary, Mr. Vibart Dixon writes as follows&quot;Circular No.31(a) of the Statutory Committee fully sets out the conditions attached to men transferred to the Reserve, and my Committee are well aware of them.     The complaint, however, is that many men are transferred to the Reserve Glass W. by the War Office, who on arrival home are found to be incapable of any kind of employment.     Many of the men have seen service abroad, and have received wounds and injuries and medical attention is often required-     The allowance of 14-/- a week is totally insufficient for such men, who very often are obliged to seek Poor Law assistance&quot; .
IRELAND.County Limerick Local Committee *With reference to the treatment of disabled men, only one case has at present been dealt with and this has been sent to Princess Patricia Hospital in Bray.      If necessary, other cases could be   treated locally in Barrington!s Hospital, or the County Infirmary.There are 51 Discharged and Disabled Soldiers in the County and steps will be taken to enquire into these cases so as to get them employment, or to train them for new occupations-Limerick Town Local Committee,There are 59 cases of Discharged or Disabled Sailors and Soldiers, six of whom have already got employment in their previous occupations.County Clare Local Oommittee.Nothing has yet been done as regards the Treatment and Training of Discharged and Disabled Soldiers and Sailors, but a start is to be ma.de at once, and the Sub-Committees are to he asked to investigate all cases in their districts as soon as possible.     There are 74 cases at present, and some sort of employment should be found for a considerable number of these.County Kerryf,Local Committee.Disabled and Discharged Sailors and Soldiers, of whom there are 55 cases returned by the Military Authorities. Some of these have obtained employment, but there is a considerable number more who if trained could do work of some kind or another.County Sligo Local Committee.There are 55 Discha- ged or Disabled Soldiers in the County but as yet nothing has been done in the way of training or of getting them employment but it is proposed to form a Disablement Committee immediately and steps will be taken to try and find work for those capable of doing it.DISABLEMENTS BRANCH.Report of Training Section.(1)    Schemes for training submit led by the Leicestershire and Wimbledon Local Committees have been sanctioned&apos;(2)   A provisional scheme for training men in the Royal Gardens at Windsor Castle has been sanctioned pending submission of a complete scheme.

&quot;HOPE WELCOMES ALL WHO ENTER HERE !6\ r9fcg^fjHAT is the keynote of the training provided for sailorsmen independent of wage-earning, could compensate them for the loss of their limbs. The question to be faced is not one of merely finding &quot; pleasant .and useful occupation&quot; for the weary weeks or months in hospital. A long view must be taken unless a vast number of these men are for the rest of their lives to sigh for what might have been, and the whole community is to lose for the greater part of one generation a valuable quota of &quot;output,&quot; to use that word in a broader than the strictly industrial sense.And here it should be put on record that it was Lady Falmouth, Mrs. Gwynne Holford and Mr. C. H. Kenderdine who were res-ponsible for the original inception of the scheme of Queen Mary&apos;s Convalescent Auxiliary Hospitals at Roehampton. It was they who first clearly saw in the very early days of war and wounds, the obvious and great dangers which would affect the men&apos;s bodily and mental condition if they were too quickly drafted from the regular hospitals to their homes without passing through a convalescent stage and- having their artificial limbs properly fitted and adjusted, andand soldiers who have lost limbs in the war, a keynotehappily struck by Her Majesty  the   Queen when   sograciously associating herself and her name with the work of these hospitals.It is indeed very necessary to bring a new and lively hope to the man thus disabled, for the fear of being not merely crippled but useless for life is very real. No pension, even if it were economically possible to make thePioneer Work.
being instructed in their use. Mr. Kenderdine later realized with commendable insight, for which the men themselves and the nation as a whole owe a deep debt, that men slowly recovering might easily degenerate and gradually come to despair as to their future unless some kind of training was linked up with their treatment. At his suggestion and under his inspiration pioneer schemes were planned and started. The Roehampton workshops were organised, and later on the workshops at Brighton.In the early days, when the question of ways and means arose, Lady Wantage, who is a member of the Committee of Management of Queen Mary&apos;s Convalescent Auxiliary Hospitals, generously came forward and defrayed the entire cost of erecting the training work-shop at Roehampton-the first to be established in connection with an Auxiliary Hospital. Later when Roehampton had already proved its usefulness, and when it was found that in the waiting weeks or months at the Military Hospital at Brighton the men became anxious and restless, Her Majesty the Queen graciously and generously offered to build preparatory workshops there, so that at no time should men who were beginning to feel anxiety about the future be without ready and practical help. To these, the pioneers, the nation has indeed reason to be grateful, for the example set at Roehampton and Brighton is being generally followed throughout the country.Life before Livelihood.It is in truth an inspiration to be amongst these men. It is not (primarily at any rate) the question of money that is troubling them. They are calmly assured of their pensions. What they are determined about is that they will not, if they can help it, bide idly and live only on their pensions. They do not mean feebly to give in and rank among the loafers. Life seems such a long, long lane to these lads, many of them with an expectation of well nigh half-a-century to travel. Think of what half-a-century of idleness would mean to just one group I talked to at the Brighton workshops ; a sturdy hand-some Scotch miner, with both legs gone but still keeping the bravest of smiles and the keenest of brains, who reminded me of an ancient tag, &quot;There ne&apos;er came a fool out o&apos; Scotland&quot;; a young Birmingham schoolmaster with one leg amputated, going back to his own work

THE WORKSHOPS AT BRIGHTON AND ROEHAMPTON.THE FIRST STAGE.Brighton is a stage before Roehampton in the hospital treatment of limbless men, but chronologically Roehampton comes first in the matter of workshops. The workshops of the Queen Mary Convalescent Auxiliary Hospitals at Roehampton were established at the end of 1915. Those at Brighton were started later and were formally opened on Her Majesty&apos;s behalf by Lady Falmouth on August 9th, 1916.At Brighton in the hospital itself there is accommodation for as many as 600 men. Queen Mary&apos;s Workshops are built in the grounds of the Royal Pavilion and are conducted in intimate relation with the hospital. The workshops are under the general direction of the Officer Commanding Col. Neil Campbell, C.B., C.I.E. The Super-intendent, Mr. Baker, however, subject to the general supervision of the Honorary Director of Technical Studies, Major Mitchell, takes charge of the organisation and administration of the instruction classes and therefore treatment and training are carried out in harmony.Training and Treatment cannot be divorced.The men remain at Brighton until their wounds are sufficiently healed to permit of their being fitted with artificial appliances. At Brighton naturally the first and foremost consideration is the hospital work and the technical training is secondary; but, as I shall hope to shew, this latter cannot at any stage be entirely divorced from a consideration of the future use of the limb or limbs in question.   In
any scheme the whole man and his particular wounds can at no period be satisfactorily treated as separate problems a fact early realised by our French Allies and co-ordinated in their elaborate system of physical, psychological and technical treatment at, for instance, the Grand Palais in Paris and the Ecole JofTre at Lyons. From the moment.a fighting man falls to the moment when he is discharged from the Services he must be considered as a man and a citizen and not exclusively as a &quot;case&quot;; the healing of his wounds, even the &quot;refitting,&quot; is not enough. The whole man body, soul and spirit must be subject to our care.First a Patient:Second a Potential Worker.The duration of a man&apos;s stay at Roehampton is governed, not by proficiency in the craft he is learning, but by the swiftness or other-wise with which the new limb is &quot;trained,&quot; so to speak, for its job. Queen Mary&apos;s Convalescent Auxiliary Hospital is, as we have said, concerned with the fitting of sailors and soldiers with artificial limbs when the stumps of arms or legs are considered by the medical authorities sufficiently healed for this next step in their treatment. I sincerely hope that those men who may read this little book will realise what a tremendous advantage they throw away if they do not work at Brighton in such measure as their powers allow so that they may prepare themselves to reap a double and treble benefit from what Roehampton has to offer.The Proof of the Pudding.The men who have been through the training one and all urge their comrades to take advantage of the splendid opportunities offered. Here is a significant quotation from an interesting private letter which came under my notice. It was written by a left-handed man (his right arm was amputated early in the war), who before enlistment was a vigorous factory worker in a specialised trade and &quot;one of the best.&quot; He wrote to a friend who had been chaffing some of the more earnest students at Queen Mary&apos;s Workshops for &quot;going back to school&quot; in the Commercial Section.   In the course of
his letter he said: &quot;All the fellows who left about the time that I &quot; did are continuing with the work here, and it is rather remarkable &quot; to note the different way in which the ones who passed through &quot;the Brighton Technical Classes tackle their work as compared with &quot;those who failed to take advantage of the unique opportunity of a &quot;training such as cannot be had anywhere else.&quot; He went on to tell of the well-paid job his old employer had made for him &quot;in the office&quot;; and to point out that but for his re-education this would have been impossible, while a one-handed man could not possibly have gone back to the work which was his before the war. The testimony of the trained men themselves is surely the most valuable we can have.A Picked Staff of Instructors.The good work done by the Superintendents and staff at Brighton and Roehampton is beyond all praise ; it is sufficient to say in passing that no ordinary academically-minded instructor, no matter what his technical qualifications, is sufficient for the unique task imposed upon him. It is in fact the opinion of some of those best able to judge that for the purpose of dealing on a national scale with this problem of the re-education of wounded men the quality and &quot;fittings&quot; of the instructors are even more important than the quality and fittings of the shops themselves. It is obvious that the men and women for this work should not only be wisely and very carefully selected, but should in addition receive a short special training at the hands of those who have had some experience of dealing with wounded men.Wounded Men as Instructors.Doubtless in time some of the disabled and re-fitted men them-selves will make valuable assistants; in fact this plan is already .being tried with excellent results. There is, for instance, an assistant instructor at Roehampton who, before his service in the Army, was a boiler maker. He has lost a leg and is already fitted with an artificial limb so perfect that it was a great surprise to me to learn that he had been to the war at all. His civilian clothes and the fact that when I saw him he had not had time to get his &quot; silver badge&quot;

led me to think that he was one of the ordinary teaching staff of Clark&apos;s College who had been exempted from Army service. Here he is, however, actually &quot;carrying on&quot; as a commercial instructor in book - keeping    and    similarsubjects in the commercial class at Roehampton, and there is here no lack of discipline, nor of ready sym-pathy between teacher and taught, but eminently the re-verse. The happiest results are likewise achieved in the engineering shops, where there is a &quot;re-fitted&quot; man instructing students in the use of their lathes. This workmanlike fellow in his blue overall was himself from boyhood trained for this and similar jobs. He has a false foot, but was able to scale a ladder to fix belting on the pulleys, set a man to work and come down again in double quick time to speak to me,only to nip across to another lathe where a beginner was in difficulties and again across the floor to the bench of a particularly promising one-armed pupil who was turning out steel parts on another lathe. He was master of his trade and his teaching, and, what was more important, was a living example to every man under his care of what can be done if there be a will and suitable oppor-tunity. One felt instinctively that he was communicating heart and hope as well as technical skill to every man he taught.Such then is the raison d&apos;etre of the two sets of workshops and the relation of the one to the other.ONE ARMED MAN REPAIRING  ELECTRIC  RADIATORS.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF WORK AND WORKSHOPS.QUEEN MARYS WORKSHOPS, PAVILION MILITARY HOSPITAL, BRIGHTON.The Brighton workshops, to which The Queen has graciously given her name, were provided, as I stated at the outset, by Her Majesty&apos;s generosity and under her active and sympathetic guidance.Nature, Aim and Scope of Training Given.To all new arrivals, as soon as they are fit &quot;to think of the future, the leaflet reprinted below is given, containing valuable hints about the training available. It is an appeal to the men while still in the early stages of their convalescence to take every possible advantage of the opportunities offered in Queen Mary&apos;s Workshops, and this is backed up by the inspiring words of the Officer Commanding: QUEEN   MARYS   WORKSHOP, PAVILION   MILITARY   HOSPITAL,   BRIGHTON.Officer Commanding: Colonel Neil Campbell, C.B., C.I.E. Honorary Director of Studies:     Major Robert Mitchell.The special attention of patients in the Hospitals is called to the facilities offered in the Queen Mary Workshops for gaining knowledge in skilled trades, and for fitting themselves for a future career. The Education facilities afford an opportunity for men with leg amputation below the knee of not only gaining knowledge in regard to Motor Car management, running repairs,
etc., but also of becoming good chauffeurs. The enormous increase in the use of motor vehicles offers an almost endless number of openings at remunerative wages.ELECTRICAL DEPARTMENT.In this shop men will be trained for the many openings which call for a knowledge of electrical machines, lighting, telephones, bells, etc. Men will be specially trained as Electrical Assistants, and Attendants in private mansions, theatres, hotels, houses of business, workshops, mills, coal mines, etc. Special instruction will also be given to men to qualify as Switch-board Attendants at any of the Electric Light Works throughout the Country.CARPENTRY AND WOODWORK SHOP.In this section men will be trained to become expert Wood Workers, making them eligible for a large number of openings in factories, workshops and houses of business, also to become House and Estate Carpenters, etc., etc.EDUCATIONAL CLASSES.These classes will prepare men for such vocations as require knowledge of good English, Book-keeping, Shorthand, Typewriting, etc., and will also afford an opportunity for those who intend to adopt other occupations to improve their general education. Other departments will be opened as occasions arise. To those men who intend either to go to the Colonies, or to adopt poultry or other farming, the Wood Work and Metal Work Classes will be invaluable.All those who are in real earnest as to their future, should take up one or more of the Courses, and thus prevent the possibility of the handicap by loss of limb bringing added regrets in after life. Her Majesty the Queen has, with the view to helping all the patients of the Pavilion Hospital, graciously provided this Workshop. Capable and sympathetic instructors will give their help and experience, and numbers of employers have expressed their willingness to engage all those men who attain a reasonable degree of independence. Those attending the Courses at the Queen Mary&apos;s Workshops . at Brighton will, when they proceed to Roehampton, be enabled to complete their instructions in similar Workshops there whilst waiting for their artificial limbs and being instructed in their use. All men who have gone successfully through either of the Trade Courses at the Workshops at Roehampton Hospital have been able to obtain good appointments ; so also will patients at this Hospital, if they take diligent advantage of the instruction provided at Brighton. Two sessions will be held daily as follows : Mornings -        -         10 till 12.Afternoons       .-        -  ; .    2 till   4.

As only ten men can be taken at a time in each shop (this number can be increased to fifteen or twenty by duplicating the teachers), patients should register their names without delay, for either the morning or afternoon course. Patients intending to avail themselves of this great opportunity will notify their names and the classes they select to the Officer Commanding, through Officers in charge of Sections.(Signed)  R.  NEIL CAMPBELL, Colonel,Officer Commanding Military Hospital, Pavilion, Brighton.The division of the preparatory classes is in four sections, viz.:   Commercial Carpentry and Woodwork, Electrical Engineering, and Motor Engineering.One of the outstanding features of the Workshops is the splendid way in which the various classes are adapted and fitted for the trades and professions taught. So far as space and the scope of the Workshops permit, every up-to-date machine and time or labour-saving device which is actually being used in the commercial world of to-day is to be found here, and the students are instructed in its use. Thanks are due to many donors of special appliances and machinery over and above those originally installed.Commercial Training Class.One finds this class fitted up as a modern model office. Students can be seen busily engaged upon typewriters; others pursue their studies at the large desks, while one man practises business conver-sation upon the telephone, and another files papers in an up-to-date filing cabinet. One also notes that copiers, duplicators, and various other attributes of the modern business office are to be found here.Carpentry and Woodwork Class.To pass on to the Carpentry and Woodwork Class, here the men are busily engaged at the benches, some being instructed in the use of the various tools, others engaged in making actual articles. Various apparatus such as a wood-turning lathe, morticing machine, fret and jig saws are to be found in use, and enable students to fit themselves for the work they will actually have to perform in the real workshops and factories.

Electrical Engineering Class., In the Electrical Engineering Class the powers and mysteries of electricity are revealed in many ways. One finds in miniature a complete electric lighting plant for a country house, dynamos, switchboards, arc lamps, and various other necessities for lighting-purposes, all of which enable students to obtain a thorough practical knowledge of the  main  essentials  necessary  for  the  work  of anQUEEN  MARYS WORKSHOPS, BRIGHTON:  MOTOR SIXTIONelectrical fitter. Various other branches of the electrical trade are taught such as electrical heating, telephones, bells and lathe work, and a section of a large switchboard, given by the General Electric Company, serves to illustrate the work of a switchboard operator. It is most pleasing to see the way in which the students take advantage of the opportunities thus offered them, and labour industri-ously to perfect themselves and become first-class men at their work.The Motor Engineering Class.This workshop is fitted up as a model garage. One finds students gathered round a &quot;Briton&quot; motor chassis, parts of which

are being explained to them by the instructor. On a stand near by stands a working model of the &quot;Daimler&quot; motor engine, enabling men to analyse or dissect any part of the engine, the working of which they do riot perfectly understand. There are three centre drilling and turning machines, a drilling machine, and benches fitted with vices and tools necessary for making small repairs. A 15-20 h.p. &quot; Darracq&quot; motor car is also an important attribute of this class, for on this car the men are instructed in the actual driving, etc. The driving power of all the machines in the workshop is derived from an electric motor which is to be found in this section.It will thus be seen that everything possible is being done to make the men really first-class workers in whatever trade or profession they may wish to enter.The Mens Own Testimony to its Value.That those who systematically avail themselves from the very beginning of all the training facilities within their reach, soon learn to value them at their proper figure, is proved by the following from amongst many extracts from letters written by men who have passed through the Queen Mary&apos;s Workshops attached to the Pavilion Military Hospital, to friends similarly maimed: &quot;... You will be surprised to find but what a few days&apos; training will &quot;do. Others beside myself can testify to my remarks. . . . You see one&apos;s &quot; thoughts are taken off one&apos;s ailment, and the general change creates an atmo-&quot; sphere of satisfaction, brought about by interest and enthusiasm, and the idea &quot; that one is, in spite of the loss of a limb, taking steps which will help to &quot;make one a useful and valuable citizen of the community.&quot;&quot;... You state in your letter that you have lost your right arm &quot;and will therefore be unable to follow your old employment. I strongly advise &quot; you to choose a career and enter the workshop, where you will be trained &quot; to become a first-class workman. . . . During my stay at the Hospital &quot; there were many men who would rather waste their time upon the sea-front, &quot;and I have since met one of these men5 and he is out of employment and &quot; has no prospects as to his future. He regrets that he did not take advantage &quot; of the opportunity which was offered to him.&quot;
BOOTMAKING :   MEASURING THE FOOTELECTRICAL SHOP, ROE HAMPTON -
&quot;... As you are aware, I was in the same position as yourself &quot; 18 months ago, having lost my left arm. I began at first to get very &quot; despondent re my future, wondering whether my disablement would interfere &quot; with my welfare. When I arrived at the Pavilion I seized the opportunity &quot; afforded me, and despite numerous temptations, commenced training in the &apos;: Commercial Section.   This course I shall never regret as long as I live.&quot;&quot;... If you care about your career at all just take a fool&apos;s advice &quot;and join the workshops. I say a fool&apos;s advice because I have often been &quot; called one for spending my afternoons in the shops instead of on the front. &quot; I know better, however, as I can show now by the position I occupy.&quot;... Having been in the Army for over 12 years, I was faced &quot; with the prospect of entering civilian life without any knowledge likely to &quot; be of much use in the vastly different conditions to be met with outside the &quot; service. . . . You will see, I am sure, how much benefit can be derived &quot;from attending these Workshops, and I would impress upon you the &quot;advisability of joining them as soon as possible, in the assurance that in &quot; after years you will look back upon it as the stepping-stone to a really &quot; useful and successful career.&quot;

ROEHAMPTON:A MODEL FOR NATION AND EMPIRE.To pass now to the second stage in the rehabilitation of our maimed soldiers, Brighton is, as I have shewn, a foundation in the initial stages of treatment for the larger work of Roehampton, which is the pioneer in England in the matter of training limbless men, the microcosm upon which to model and develop such industrial and commercial training throughout the country. In each locality the broad principles here worked out in theory and practice would of Course need to be adapted to particular needs ; but Roehampton has shewn the way, and: in this connection it may be said that administrators and others from different parts of Great Britain, as also from the Overseas Dominions, are constantly visiting its work-shops and commercial centre.The experience here gained cannot fail to be of service to those who are or may be responsible for starting in connection with hospital treatment such technical training elsewhere. It is much to be desired that similar opportunities should be given to wounded men throughout the length and breadth of the land. There are already many others, one is glad to know, springing up in different parts of the country on more or less the same lines notably at Newcastle, Leeds, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dublin and Belfast.More Workshops Needed and from the Public Purse.One thing is clear, however, and that is that this work is a national  responsibility  and  should  not  for  long be left to privateA Mine of Information

initiative or private charity. In our typically English way we have allowed the first experiments to be made by voluntary effort, and the nation and the wounded men have reason to be, as they undoubtedly are, devoutly thankful for the ready generosity of Royal and other donors in the initial stages of the work. The need of training institutions, however, has, it is claimed at Roehampton, passed beyond the experimental stage and the national work should not in the future be left to be &quot; supported entirely by voluntary contri-butions.&quot; An estimate can by this time be made of the probable needs of the country, and the cost should be met from public funds. Further, if no man is to be discharged from the army until he is fully able to resume civil life which is surely desirable this will involve the multiplication of training centres and workshops until there is accommodation for the men of every town and village in the land.The Employment Bureau in connection with the workshops at Roehampton, under the able direction of Mr. Dudley Myers, is competently staffed, and voluminous records are kept primarily to enlighten the men in every possible way as to the correct procedure for applying (a) for pensions (b) for employment; both staff and records, however, have a much- wider scope and value. The elaborate card indexing of the men&apos;s records will, for instance, be of the utmost service especially while the training and employment of wounded men are in their infancy; for the speed with which it is necessary to draft these men back into actual industrial or other work will necessitate the medical authorities keeping in touch with them and overhauling them from time to time.The Nature,. Aim and Scope of the Teaching.The following is a copy of a leaflet given to each disabled man in the Roehampton Hospital, when he is admitted: &quot;QUEEN MARY&apos;S CONVALESCENT AUXILIARY HOSPITALS.&quot; The attention of men entering this Hospital is directed to the facilities &quot;which are offered to them of acquiring instruction in Electric Lighting and &quot; Motors, Telephones and Electric Bells, Motor Car Mechanism and Driving,

&quot; Engineering, Wood-working and Turning, in Workshops organised for the &quot; purpose by Major Robert Mitchell, Director of Education, Polytechnic, &quot; Regent Street, London, W., and provided with qualified Instructors. In &quot; addition there are demonstration classes in Fancy Leather Work, while &quot; Light Basket Making is regularly taught. Commercial Classes are also &quot;held by Clark&apos;s College for the purpose of giving tuition in Book-keeping, &quot;Typewriting, Shorthand and other useful subjects. Men are urged, in their &quot; own interests, to make full use of these opportunities, and are asked to &quot; discuss matters with Mr. Andrew, the Superintendent of the Workshops &quot; and Recreation Rooms, who Avill give all information and make arrarige-&quot; ments for those wishing to join any of the Classes. Certificates will be &quot; awarded to all those attending the Workshops regularly, stating the number &quot; of hours of instruction received. Arrangements have also been made for &quot; those men, who, on obtaining their discharge, wish to continue their &quot; training. Such assistance to acquire proficiency will, where possible, be &quot; afforded at Institutions near to the homes of those desirous of availing &quot; themselves of the privilege and will not be confined to the trades taught at &quot; Roehampton, but will, be extended, as far as possible, to any branch of &quot;industry which any man may wish to take up.&quot;&quot; For those interested in Poultry Culture, weekly lectures are given by &quot; Captain Peirson Webber, and a poultry farm has been established with a &quot;view.to imparting practical knowledge on this important subject.&quot;There is an EMPLOYMENT BUREAU at the Hospital in the &quot;interests of the patients, and every effort is made to further their wishes &quot; in regard to their future careers.&quot;&quot; All Pension and Pay difficulties are also dealt with at the Bureau, and &quot; men are invited to seek assistance in the settlement of these and other &quot;personal matters in regard to which they may be in need of help or advice.&quot;I may perhaps amplify this leaflet by a further brief statement. The Commercial Classes are conducted on voluntary lines by Clark&apos;s College, under the personal direction of the Principal, Mr. George Clark, and the facilities of that progressive institution in any locality to which the men may afterwards go will be available for wounded men under special and attractive terms. One advantage is that men who have been through the Roehampton Commercial Classes may continue at any Centre, Metropolitan or Provincial, where there is a branch of Clark&apos;s College, for one year free of charge.
Training and Employment.The Roehampton Workshops have from the outset owed much to the zealous and untiring work of the Honorary Secretary of the Employment Bureau, Mr. Dudley Myers, who has worked in season and out of season for the men, both during and after their residence at Roehampton. One of the most useful and practical forms of service rendered to the work by Mr. Myers are the Lectures given weekly by him to the assembled men, in which he explains fully allTHE COMMERCIAL CLASS, ROEHAMPTON.questions of pensions, training facilities, conditions in the labour market and many other practical points which the men are eager to know and understand. In this latter connection it may be well to state that some anxiety has been felt both by wounded men and by prospective employers on the question of Insurance under the Employers&apos; Liability Act in the future. The Insurance Companies have, however, now sent out notices to employers and men stating that they are prepared to insure wounded soldiers re-entering civil life on the same terms as non-wounded men. It is well that this very important point has been satisfactorily settled.

)This list does not, as a matter of fact, exhaust the facilities available at present time, as practically every industry throughout the country is prepared to absorb men and train them for their own purposes. The whole of the industrial facilities of the country are open to the men. Many Employers will train men and pay them while they are being, trained.The following are illustrations of the types of employment found for men who have lost an arm: ClerkCommissionaireGatemanGymnasticInstructor Labour Masterin WorkhouseLiftman Lodge Keeper Messenger PorterRailway Worker (sundry duties) SchoolmasterTelephone Switch-board Attendant Timekeeper Traveller Ward Master W atchman W eighmanThe following are illustrations of the types of employment found for men who have lost a leg: Bootmaker Caretaker Chauffeur Domestic Servant Electrical Worker(sundry types) EngineeringWorker Gateman Groom Hall Porter Hospital OrderlyIndustrial Worker (sundry types)LiftmanLight Duties (man for pithead for miners)Lodge KeeperMunition MakerMilkerPackerPainterPostal EmployeePrinterRailway Worker (sundry types) Road Worker TailorTelephone AttendantTelegraphistTimekeeperVanmanWatchmanWeigh manIn the eighteen months during which the Hospitals have been open up to March 1st, 1917, the figures of the Employment Bureau are as follows : class A.

For, just over a year ago, through your agency I obtained my &quot;position of Cost Clerk to the Electricity Department of the Corporation of &quot;Worcester at a salary of 35/- per week. Am now at a salary of 45/-,&apos; &quot;which sum is considerably augmented as at moment am on constant over-&quot; time, my immediate prospects of advancement are also exceedingly good. &quot; Through the experience gained here I was offered a very remunerative &quot;position ( 3 per week) at a large Munition Factory in London, but the &quot; Corporation have induced me to stay by raising my money.&quot; I cannot speak too highly of the way we fellows were advised and &quot; assisted at Roehampton and for the courteous way in which we were treated. &quot; The value of such an agency as yours is immense, for there is the oppor-&quot; tunity for fellows to realise that they still are perfectly capable of earning &quot;quite a comfortable living, before the rebuffs of the work-a-day world are &quot; met with. It is then up to the man to make his job safe. Ever again &quot;thanking you for your very kind assistance.&quot;.
CONCLUSION.Any money the men may earn in the world&apos;s workshops must be in addition to their fixed pensions, in order that our returned fighting men and their dependents, if any, may enjoy as high as possible a &quot;standard of living.&quot; This will redound to the credit and advantage not only of themselves but also of the whole community. The entire scheme must be devised on such a basis that in the future no war hero need be driven to beggary unless he is an outcast and a slacker who deserves to beg. &quot;The old soldier&quot; of our streets, if any such should result from this war, must never be able to say with truth that he has anyone but himself to blame for his destitute condition and inability to &quot;make ends meet.&quot;The present army embraces men of almost all ranks and achieve-ments; there is therefore need for considerable elasticity in training them for future careers.Treatment and training must from the first go hand in hand, not only during the period of the war but in many cases for some years to come.The public medical as well as the public educational facilities of the country must be available for periodic advice and help. Moreover, apart from purely medical considerations, it must be understood and remembered that false limbs will from time to time get out of order and will need repair and replacement. The &quot;equipment&quot; of the maimed in our future industrial army will be as much a national duty, and should be as certainly a national charge, as was the equipment of them with arms and munitions when they were units of the fighting army.The hardest form of the laying down of one&apos;s life for one&apos;s friends, and the form that calls for most heroism, is that in which life is not taken swiftly in the glory of its complete surrender, in the
fire of the battle, but is given back in part, maimed and mangled. We cannot too often remind ourselves that these men have given their very lives for us in a unique and special sense, and that the measure of our gratitude to those who have passed beyond our power of personal thanks will be our treatment of those who are maimed but living. To the broken families of the heroic dead we owe a debt we cannot fully pay ; to the broken men who survive we owe a double debt, for we have both them and their dependents with us as a living reminder of what treasure in the truest sense has had to be sacrificed for the freedom of the world and that debt is within our power in some measure to discharge.

His guidance and assistance have been one of the main secrets of the success which has attended the efforts of those who have been working together for the cause of our disabled men.The workshops at Roehampton and Brighton were erected and equipped under his direct supervision, and his expert knowledge and advice on the course of instruction to be followed in the various sections have been of the greatest value. Major Mitchell is one of the foremost authorities in the country on the subject of technical training which is now being universally adopted in the interests of our wounded men. Long before any National Scheme had been thought out he placed the. vast resources of the Polytechnic at the disposal of Roehampton men, on their discharge from Hospital, and generously offered them a free course of training in any direction they- elected. Hundreds of men have availed themselves of this opportunity and have thereby obtained good and remunerative em-ploy ment which would otherwise never have been open to them. Truly it may be said that those who are primarily responsible for the work which this booklet seeks briefly to describe have indeed been fortunate in being able to rely at all times on Major Mitchell&apos;s help and co-operation.

MEMORANDUMonthe training and employment of disabled sailors and  soldiers.By dudley B. myers.The experience gained at Roehampton during the past eighteen months not only leads to definite conclusions, but points microcosmically to the methods which should be adopted in dealing with the greater problem so urgently calling for solution.It has been found that the men resolve themselves automatically into three distinct classes, the proportions of which can now be definitely stated. They are as follows: class a__Men who are prepared to work anywhere andfor whom employment should be provided before they leave hospital       ......      ......      ...      ...  25%class B__Men who have had their places kept open forthem and who on discharge from hospital will returnto their former employers ...       ...       ...       ...  40%class C Men who place domicile before work and who will not discuss employment except in the vicinity of their own homes   ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   35%It will be realised that Class a offers the most urgent problem, as it includes a large proportion of young men and a large number of men with no settled homes to go to.Class B presents no problem for solution.Class C is composed mainly of married men who are prepared to accept any work they are capable of performing so long as it does not involve the breaking up of their homes. To provide for this class is one of the primary responsibilities of the local War Pensions Committees.
In order to deal effectively with the whole question the following principles are essential: 1. Centralisation of Control.2. Co-ordination of Effort.3. Collective Handling of the Men.The position in the country, as a whole, must be centrally focussed,&apos; directed, and controlled.The work of the local Committees and Labour Exchanges must be closely co-ordinated, and the tendency which would appear to: exist at the present time, to encourage the formulation of local training and employment schemes leading insensibly to the setting up of a number of water-tight compartments working more or less independently of each other, should be checked. Cohesion is as essential to successful results as is uniformity of system.Collectivity is the master key to the whole situation, as without it the problem can never be handled and the position can never be focussed. If men are allowed to be discharged at random from hospitals all over the country, as at present, all power of dealing effectively with the requirements of the situation will be lost. It is essential that before they are discharged they should be classified; that Class A should be provided for, and that Class C should be passed on to the local Committees to be dealt with. It is beyond question that once men with no settled homes and no definite ideas are discharged from hospital, they will drift and will never be induced to render themselves efficient and useful members of the industrial forces of the country. The principle of collectivity, applied at the right time, alone admits of their being properly guided, of their ideas being moulded, and of their being given the necessary impetus to fit themselves for new and useful careers. It is only by the collective handling of men that the best results can be achieved, and that the stimulating effect of example can be brought to bear.It follows, then, that throughout the country a number of convalescent hospitals should be set aside for the treatment of those men who are awaiting discharge from the Services. Roehampton offers a model which should be copied, and although this Hospital deals only with men who have lost a limb, the principle remains. Hospitals on similar lines should be established to which would be transferred from other institutions, in the earliest possible stage of convalescence, all cases which were recognised as certain to be invalided out of the Service. These hospitals should be geographically distributed to meet the requirements of the various centres.
It would not involve the setting up of new hospitals, &apos; but rather the allocation of certain Hospitals for a specific purpose and the redistribution of the patients at a certain stage of their convalescence. If it were possible to apply the territorial principle and to transfer men to hospitals in their own counties, it would be very desirable from many points of view.To these hospitals workshops should be attached on lines to be determined, to some extent, by local industrial conditions. The Roehampton methods should be followed of giving as much preliminary training as possible during the period of convalescence, and of passing the men on to the nearest technical institutes to complete their education on discharge from hospital.Experience has shown that as time goes on and the haunting dread of pensions being interfered with by earnings is gradually dissipated, the appreciation of the advantages to be gained by undergoing some form of technical training tends to increase rapidly. The training facilities provided at Roehampton and the Pavilion Military Hospital, Brighton, working in con-junction with each other, together with the facilities for after-training provided within most generous limits at the Polytechnic in Regent Street, are now, as a rule, taxed to their utmost capacity. The results obtained have proved in every way encouraging and gratifying. The men attending the classes in hospital are drawn from all ranks, but those who pass on, after discharge, for a final course of training are mainly drawn from Class A with a sprinkling of Class C men. If the latter were certain of the requisite after-training facilities being provided near their homes they would doubtless be more disposed to face re-education ; but, generally speaking, it has so far been found desirable to give such training in London. Class B men, among whom there are many who are anxious to improve themselves and to add to their qualifications, are not slow to avail themselves, while in hospital, of the training facilities afforded, but there the matter usually ends.The system of training aimed at should be short and intensive, the object being to make men wage-earning as quickly as possible, and to render them of sufficient value to employers to admit of their being rapidly absorbed into the industries of the country. Their training then becomes progressive, on a wage-earning basis, in the industries themselves.The mobilisation of the industries of the country should be aimed at on an associated basis and with the co-operation of the trade unions. If each trade or industry would follow the example of the National Leather Goods Manufacturers&apos; Association and of the Cinematograph trade, and establish a central agency to facilitate and regulate the  training   of  men   seeking
re-education, and to arrange for the distribution of the labour so trained, it would greatly assist matters. It would, moreover, prove specially valuable when the after-war labour problems have to be faced.There should be a National Register of all disabled men, showing how they have been dealt with from the industrial standpoint, while.a Central Employment Agency and General Information Bureau should be established for the use, more especially, of the drifters. It must be remembered that many men are provided with work which they never take up or which they throw up after a very short time. These men drift about the country and gravitate to a large extent to London, coming under no special local Com-mittee, owing to their constant change of domicile, and not knowing where to look for assistance. There should be the one Central Agency to which every ex-sailor and soldier knows he can turn when he gets out of touch with the existing local machinery. Neediess to say, the drifters will rarely be found among the men who have consented to learn a trade.In conclusion, it may safely be asserted that the problem of dealing with disabled men is one which calls for the utmost sympathy and for the exercise of the greatest tact. They cannot be driven, nor will they face arbitrary restrictions, and regulations. They must be coaxed; they must be reasoned with; and they must be guided. Left to themselves, they will, as a rule, take up work only when obliged to, and then only the work which can be obtained with the least trouble. Technical training and re-education do not instinctively appeal to them. The advantages to be gained have to be placed very clearly before them and they are, generally speaking, attracted only to what they see and to the trades in connection with which the course of training to be faced and the work to be done are practically demonstrated to them. The personal factor is what counts for most in dealing with these brave men, and without it little good can be done. Given patience, however, together with a full measure of human sympathy and understanding, the results to be obtained are such as to render of no account whatever labour and expenditure may be involved in helping them to solve the problem of their future careers.Dudley B. Myers, Honorary Secretary, Employment Bureau.Roehampton, 26th February, 1917.
