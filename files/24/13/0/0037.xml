?st AH    CABINET,ECS E ITHE IRISH QUESTION.?. 737(Copy of a letter from the Prime Minister to Mr. Redmond, dated 16th Kay 1917Dear Mr. Redmond,oeen consideringfor some time what c about a settlement ofThe Government have further action they could take to brin the Irish question.   They have approached the subject with a deep desiro to put an end to a state of affairs which is pro ductive of immense evil not only to Ireland but to Great Britain and the Empire,    The choice of alternatives open tcthem, however, have been narrowed by the fact that it is im-possible for them, in the crisis of a war in which our safety and the liberty of most of the nations of Europe is at stake, to take action which would revive violent political controversy and so weaken er imperil the unity which is essential to theSUOreme   ^ftriftooi vtt   a-F   wlnvii n a   +V10   wrn -**necessity.of winning the war.    They have, therefore,felt that any settlement which they could propose durin&amp; the war must be one which would be substantially accepted by both sides..   They would Lave wished - in accordance with this prin-ciple - to enter upon negotiations with tie Irish representa-tives, but this, as you know, was impossible, owing to the decision of your Party not to negotiate with the Government.
The idea of the Government has been to try to effect an immediate settlement conceding the largest possible measure of Home Rule which can be secured by agreement at this moment, without prejudice to the undertaking by Parliament of a further and final settlement of the questions most in dispute, after the War.    They are, therefore, prepared to put forward propos-als on the following lines, with a view to present action.Firstly, they would introduce a Bill for the immediate application of the Home Rule Act to Ireland, but excluding there-from the six Counties of ftorth-Eaet Ulster., such exclusion to bo subject to reconsideration by Parliament at the end of five years unless it is previously terminated by the action of the Council of Ireland to be set up as hereinafter&quot;described.Secondly, with a view to scouring the largest possible measure cf common action for the whole of Ireland,.the Bill would provide for a Council of Ireland to bo composed of two delegations, con-sisting, .on the one hand, of all the members returned to Westminster from the excluded ere&amp;,.und,.on the other, of a dele-gaticn equal&apos; in numbers from the Irish Parliament.    This Council could be summoned on the initiative of any six members,    It would be empowered by a majority of votes of each of the delegations:-(a) to pass private Bill legislation b.if eating both the included and the excluded area; (t) to recommend to the Crown the extension to the excluded area by Order in Council of any Act of the Irish Parliament;  (c) to agree to the inclusion under the Home Rule Act of the whole of Ireland, subject to the assent of the majority of the voters in the excluded area, power to be vested in the Crown in that case to extend the Act to all Ireland by Order in Council;-(&amp;) to make recommendations on its own initiative upon Irish cnaes-tiens, including the amendment of the Home Rule Act as finally passed.The President of this Council of Ireland would be elected by agreement between the delegations or in default of agreement ho would be nominated by the Crown.-
Thirdly, the Government consider that the financial proposals cf the Home Rule Act are unsatis-factory and ought to be reconsidered,       There are a number of important objects such as the develop-ment of Irish industries, the improvement of housing in the towns, and the furtherance of education (including a better scale of remuneration for teachers) which cannot be adequately dealt with, owing to changed conditions which have arisen since the War, under the provisions of that Act, without imposing an undue burden on the Irish taxpayer.Fourthly, the Government would recommend that after the Becond reading, the Bill embodying the above proposals together with the Home Rule Act, should be forthwith considered by a Conference to be constituted on the lines of the Speaker&apos;s Conference on Electoral Reform though not ocn-sisting exclusively of members of Parliament, and meeting under the chairmanship of ocmeone commanding the same general confidence in Ms impartiality and judgment as Mr. Speaker himself. The Conference would, of course, have full power to suggest any alterations in the Government scheme upon which it might decide.Tho Government feel that a proposal which provides for immediate Home Rule for the greater part of Ireland,, while excluding that part of Ireland which objects to coming under the Home Rule Act, for a definite pericd after which Parliament will consider the matter afresh; which recognises the profound sentiment existing in Ireland for the unity of the country by creating a common Council to consider Irish affairs as a whole;   which, finally, sets up a representa--tive Conference to attempt to adjust the most difficult.questions involved, is as far as they can possibly go towards Effecting a legislative settlement in the crisis of a great War.     They are prepared to introduce a Bill on these lines.&apos; But they feel that it would be idle, and I am sure you will agree with them, to introduce such a Bill unless it were assured of some-thing like a second reading acceptance from both Irish Parties.       I earnestly hope that if the Government introduce this Bill the Party of which you&apos;are the head will give this measure of support
to proposals which will give immediate self-government in Ireland to those who wish for it, and will at the same time create and keep continuously in being ths means whereby a final reconciliation between the two sections of the Irish people can at any time be brought about.We earnestly recommend the proposals which I have outlined above to the dispassionate consideration of men of all parties.   If upon such consideration a be sis for immediate action is found in then we shall proceed at once with the necessary steps to carry them into effect.     If this should not be the case there remains an alternative plan which, though it has been sometimes seriously discussed, have never been authoriT^tively proposed:that of assembling a Con-vention of Irishmen of ail parties for the purpose of producing e soheme of Irish self government.   &quot;As you will remamber the constitution of the Union of South Africa was framed despite most formidable difficulties and obstacles by a Convention representative of all the interestsand parties in the country, and the Government believes that a similar expedient might, in the last resort, be found effectual in Ireland. Would it be too much to hope that Irishmen of all creeds and parties might moot together in a Convention for the purpose of drafting a Constitution for their country which should secure a just balance of all the opposing interests and finally compose the unhappy discords which have co long distracted Ireland and impeded its harmonious development? The C-overnment is ready, in default of the adoption of their proposals for Home Rule, to take the necessary stops for the assembling of such a Convention.I should be much obliged if you found it possible -to give me your views on this letter in order to allow the government to consider the matter before Monday.(Signed)     n. LLOYD OEQHSE.
