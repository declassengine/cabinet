SECRETNoWar    ) Cabinet Paper&quot;565 tii April] 1917.   )n mIMMEDIATE AND URGENTFOR INFORMATION OF WAR CABINET. FROM FIRST SEA LORD.THE PORTUGUESE DIVISIONThe attached paper shews how the case stands as regards the transport of the Portuguese Division to France.2.      From the reports of the transport officers and the Captains of the transports, no discipline exists amongst the troops, and as they are believed to have little military value it is proposed for the considera-tion of the War Cabinet that the move which commences on the 16th instant should be the last, and that the transports should be freed for work which is far more urgent and necessary to the interests of the Country and the War.        If this course is not approved it will mean that seven large transports will be kept for another month (i.e. the end of June) before they can be utilised for carrying necessary foodstuffs etc. to this country.       IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THESE SEVEN VESSELS COULD - IF USED FOR BRINGING HOME WHEAT FROM AMERICA -   CARRY BETWEEN 60,000 and 70,000 tons OF FOODSTUFFS ON EACH TRIP.       What is at least as important is the fact that the four destroyers which are detailed for the escort would similarly be kept back from patrolling trade routes and hunting sub-marines, a service for which they are most.urgently needed.        For the same reasons it is proposed that no re-inforcements should be carried unless this is done by the Portuguese in their own ships, escorted by their own destroyers.The approval of the War Cabinet for this policy is asked for.12th MAY, 1917.
