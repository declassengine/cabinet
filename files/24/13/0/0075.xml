SECRET CSWAR   CABINET.G-.T. 773Shipping Strategy in the Atlantic,In accordance with the directions of the War-Cabinet (War Cabinet 137, Minute 10) the proposals made by Sir Leo Chiozza Money, M.P. (Papers G.T. 660, dated May 4th, 1917; G.T. 698, dated May 7th, 1917;    G,T, 711, dated Kay 11th, 1917) and a memorandum (Paper G,T. 697, dated May 10th,* .1917) by the Shipping Controller, were considered by a Committee composed of -Admiral Sir John JelliooeSir Joseph Maclay (Shipping Controller)Sir Leo Chiozza Money, M.P.))   Ministry of Sir Kenneth Anderson )     Shipping..Sir II. Babington Smith )) Board of Trade. Professor Chapman )Rear-Admiral Duff   )J   Admiralty. Captain Webb, R.N, )Mr. Fielding (Ministry of Munitions)The Admiralty representatives expressed their strong view that the proposal to concentrate trade to the greatest possible extent on North Atlantic routes was one which would afford very great relief to our present overstrained naval resources, and Would also greatly facilitate the adoption of the convoy system, and the Committee, after considering the question, decided to recommend its immediate acceptance in principle.     The steps which it is necessary should be taken to put the scheme into force are detailed below;-(1) . THE PURCHASE OP SUPPLIES IN AMERICA.(a) Each purchasing department to be immediately instructed to procure its further supplies from the United States and Canada and tc limit its commitments in other markets to the lowest, possible level,(b) Machinery already exists for the co-ordination of departmental requirements in the Tonnage Priority Committee,
and this &quot;body could efficiently p-erf^orm the isunc-tion of concentrating demand upon America.     Pra/rtlc-al difTLfy-g.ties could he discussed and settled and questions of suhstita^J-o-A disposed of.(c)     The Tonnage Priority Committee and/or the Board of Trade could ensure that private demand for commodities is directed into the proper channels     Private demand, however, has now reached a very low level.     The facts are that the Tonnage Priority Committee has allocated 92% of the avail-able tonnage to the requirements of (a) the Pood Controller, (b) the War Office, (c) the Admiralty,  (d) the Timber Con-troller,  and (e) the Minister of Munitions,( 2) ACTION iii AND BY AMERICA,The co-operation of the American Government is essential.     The presence of Mr, Ealfour in America enables us to broach the scheme immediately.   When Mr; Balfour leave it would be essential that some gentleman carrying great weight - preferably a Cabinet Minister - should go tc the United States in order that he might undertake the task of safeguarding the scheme on the American side.   He might well be accompanied by a commission of experts from the various Department s,(3) The commercial interest of America runs with thescheme and there is no reason to apprehend that there would be any difficulty in that respect *     It is., however, important that the American Government should arrange that the large domestic demand in America for steel,  etc.. is not allowed to swamp war requirements,(4) It would be necessary to reorganise horth AmericanAtlantic ports, arranging for day and night shifts; improved railway facilities, etc.(5)     -     PORT WORK HERE,A strong Port Department in the Ministry of Shipping is being more and more developed to deal with matters in the United Kingdom.     The development of railway facilities is also being reviewed.(6) RESERVE Off. SHIPS.The formation of a reserve of shipping deserves serious consideration, and its practicability should be considered in detail as soon as the scheme fructifies.(7) EXPORT TRADE.The effect on the export trade of the proposed diversion of shipping tc the North Atlantic routes should be fully considered in order to secure that important export industries may suffer as little as practicable,     It is suggested that a Committee,  similarly constituted tc the
Restriction of Imports Committee, which recently sat under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Babington Smith, might well be entrusted with the consideration of exports in detail

(8) IINDIA AND THE DOMINIONS

In regard to India and the Dominions, the problem is largely financial. A certain amount of import and export trade must necessarily continue.
