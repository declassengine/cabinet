SECRET G.T. 749:WAR   CABINET.russii(&quot;The following letter from Professor Pares has been communicated to me. by Mr. Harold Baker, M.P. and will, perhaps, interest members of the war Cabinet.       The original io very illegible, and some errors may have been made in oopying..  (Sgd.). H.P.A. HANKEY&quot;)PETROGKAD.27th April, 1917.dear harold,I come back from the front because things were very bad - discipline gone to pot in many parts.     I found all ether reports were the same and Gutehkov has publicly acknowledged a &quot;mass desertion&quot;. .    Authorities suggest more than a million.It came very simply;    not - be very clear -..from the transfer of power.      That quite definitely improved the spirit of the troops.     It was announced in the simplest and best way, just all the chief facts, after the fait accompli.     I have not met the officer or man who regrets the old regime;    take for instance Sazonov-, . with whom I have had a long talk, he in perfectly explicit about the impossible position that they had reached..     The troops took the news&quot;with joy, and from that date there reigned just the mood of our own front, that the la3t obstacle was removed, that we had the Germans beat, and that he had nothing left to fight for..Then came the trouble.     The Council of Workmen and Soldiers in Petrograd were quite wrongly afraid that the Army might prove a weapon of reaction, 00 they sent up a mass of students &quot;to democratise&quot; the most democratic army in the world.     It was no political question that troubled the army..    The officers are naturally for a constitutional monarchy but do net press it and would willingly accept the decision cf the majority,, though they didn&apos;t see why they should be excluded from a share in the decision..     But their only business point was that the army must not be tampered with and must be left to do its job tc the end..    They think and talk exactly like the vast majority of England;    it is the labour people of the rear (?) who are confusing ....Well,, the students arrived early and en masse and gave the men the idea that discipline wa3 unnecessary,  an idea confirmed by some Government orders which were issued under the same pres-sure..    With the men it was a pure animal movement.   If they need, not obey their officers they were free to go away, and they did so in the simplest way..   They cleared out in large numbers, and the officers, especially the best of them who are very mortified,felt that they were not allowed to punish..There are several signs of the German hand in this.   The manoeuvre of raising the land question now and telling the men to get back in time for a land partition is a   ?    stupidity but the features of its application smell German...   Speeches here are too identical with German messages thrown across the front, or with earlier German press articles,. e.g... in Roumanian.  But one must be very careful with this, for a lot of it is undoubtedly native Russian Socialism,Everyone Is anxious,,. Gutchkov,,. who is laid up.is hard put to it.   As he told me yesterday (he was in bed) it is a Penelope5 s web. By his wish and the Ambassador&apos;s it is arranged that I am tc go straight down the whole front talking to the men,especially in the
unitB where I have lived.     I start very shortly and every-thing is being arranged to make it of use.Sazanov^s motto (I asked him: what are we English to do?) is: keen cool, dont do anything excited, above all dor^t regard us as a quantity: negligible and it will comeright. I cm trying to get him to sry something through Reuterls to England.ii.ll our people are h: rd rt v^ork.     Thx.t fine trio, Enox, Blair rnd Thornhill are excellent (of course all the makeshift mission men ire of little use in this matter).     The Ambassador has made some first-rate speeches.     But we are all in danger of feeling too much personal mortification, which will not help.In a word, if there had been no war we should have thought the revolution wonderfully pacific.     But without the war it could not have been so.     The old army has gone and the new crmy, officers and men, is as national (?) as our own.     In short, it is the conflict of two terms:   either the revolution will have spoilt the war, or the war will have SLved the revolution.     I hope the second.I shall see the chief labour men here before I start.   We must really do our best to understand them.     The revolution is a groat thing and I feel there can be no return to autocracy except through its possible excesses. -   They must be allowed to talk:    the other line, or to put it cnother way, the imposition of our own plan of war development, won&apos;t do.There are very few men ct.pr.ble ox governing here at present (though more will be bred with great repjdity).    This is one -of the chief factors.     All the right men are good Slavophils end war men.     The pacifiot view has no head or brains to it, a matter of crude popular instinct which might become e. strong war mood as it did in England the moment it become intelligent and informed.     But the strain is great end I donH want to see the few good men (one to every 100 of ours) used up in health and other ways).Pleose hove this typed and send copies to Honkey,-Lord Sanderson and if you like Lloyd George.     I am very fit.Yours ever,(Intd).   B.P.Expect foolishness from Milyukov.   They call him here w the god of tactlessness&quot; but I don&apos;t think he111 stay long this time.     Will Thorne, Sanders and 0&apos;Grady were simply admirable.
