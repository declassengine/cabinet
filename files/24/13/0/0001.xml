-ffi CAB/A/,SECRET,From:-To&quot;: -General Dclmc Radcliffe,     ^^^ FaTX^^ -Cornando Supremo, Italy.Sir William Robertson./*7.11th May, 1917.No. 936..  Secret and Personal/Italian General Staff has again appealed to me to represent seriousness of the present deficiency of coal in Italy, from military point of view.Ministers inform me that situation is, though very serious, not so alarming as thought in some quarters, as (a).       Coal reserve of the Navy is 600,000 tons which, in case of great necessity, 400,000.might be borrowed for industrial and transport purpose.(b).       That, as a temporary measure, a considerable amount of coal has been transferred from Government indue-trial facilities (?) to the railways.-(c).       That by June (one group undecipherable) number ships will be released from importing corn to carry coal.But the above palliative solutions are considered dangerous for military reasons, as :(1) Depletion of Navy coal reserve would mean paralysisof fleet which the enemy would know and profit by. (2) Transfer of coal from the factories to railwayinvolves shutting down works, reducing still further munitions output and causing much depression in the country with dangerous internal disturbance.    (It is my knowledge that many workshops arc stopping now.) (3)        We cannot count upon release of ships from corn to coal as crop may not promise well, it may be necessary to build up a corn reserve and tonnage may be still moro scarce in June.   . I am informed the Minister Orlando has gone to London with Capelcur (from British Embassy, Rome):   !! &apos; i  in     -; / 0&quot;II Si
in Order to represent coal situation.-on behalf of Italian Government and Burjope-an siipolieSi       Orlando&apos;s perfect honesty in desiring to see coal situation really satisfactory^ settled I have private reason to doubts      This ia evidently also General Cadorna&apos;s fear.     Orlando is a slippery politloi&amp;i and may for personal reasons and, if he is not very well received, foment strong prejudice against England, and thus produce fall of present Italian Government,   Or $Ise he im$ conclude an unworkable arrangement, the blame for which will be thrown on British Government as in case of Pallanaa Conference,    In Pallanza affair Capelour was largely concerned and generally inspires little confidence.    It is very necessary that Italy should be really supplied with sufficient coal to enable her to carry on the war which is what the whole thing amounts to.     The General Sta  / officially inform me in an urgent communication to-day tnat on May 1st there was remaining less than .one month1s supply of coal available for the railway,     It will be impossible to make great Movement such as necessitated by sudden concentration of rssftrve army or a .large transfer of troops from the Eastern to the ^rentino front unless the coal arrives at once.     The probability is that enemy is well informed concerning this and is counting upon itoIt is suggested by General Staff that I go to England at once to press matter personally, but I have assured General Ca&amp;orna that you will make military urgency of the matterclear to the British Government as to ensure necessity bein^isatisfactorily met unless impossible, 1General Cadorna is anxi-ous.....to lia^ve -early informationas to decision reached.\
