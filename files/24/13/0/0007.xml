SECRET,- 71- .     - &apos; Wi^; CAB IKBT.- 8 x&quot; THE OIL SITUATION,(Copy of letter from Mr.E.S.Pretyman, M.F. to the Secretary, War -Cabinet.)Admiralty, Whitehall/11th.Key; 1917.Dear Sir Maurice Hankey^I have been away for nearly-a week visiting the Northern&apos;&quot; Bases of the Fleet, and on my return have just received a letter 5    from Sir/Albert Stanley with:&amp; copy of a Minute he has sent to  -the Cabinet on,the oil situation and urging a restriction of supplies *Sir Albert Stanley has suggested that a Member of the War Cabinet might take the matter in hand in conference with representatives of the Departments concerned.     You are no doubt aware that all the Departments are already represented in the Interdepartmental Petroleum,Committee who have already had this matter under sorious consideration and under whose auspices the Pool Board has recently been organised.     The Committee would be glad of the opportunity of laying the position before a Llember of the Cabinet and this procedure would save time as the vlevsof all the public Departments arc concentrated in the   Committee.There is some difficulty at present in dealing promptly with the situation as the Petrol Committee appointed by fee Board &apos; of Trade has, by its reference,  jurisdiction over the- distribution of Petrol and the Pool Board acting under the Departmental Committee cannot restrict supplies without their consent.     Perhaps yen will lay this letter before the Cabinet when they consider Sir Albert Stanley&apos;s Minute.. ,Yours sincerely; .( s i gn e d) E. Gf. Pretyinah. :
