From Resident, Aden, 15th May 19.17. (Repeated io Simla, and High Commissioner, Cairo.) (Received at India Office, 7 p.m.)359 A.P. Messengers, including a relative of Nasir Mabkhnt, arrived here 9th May, bringing letters from Said Mahomet bin Yehia bin Al fladi bin Al Muayecl Billah bin Al Kasim of Kasim house of Saids of Sanaa. Letters reached me on 7 th May from (I) Sherif Behan! (2) Yehia bin Yehia Ashshaif, (3) Aminash Sherif Abdur Rahman bin Hussein of Saba. The purport of all these letters is that tribes of Yemen have decided to over-throw the present Imam, to support as his successor a son of Said Mahomet bin Yehia mentioned above, his name has not yet been made public in Yemen,-and to eject Turkish troops from Yemen. Conversation with chief messengers confirmed this. Movement is supported by (1) Said Mahomet bin Yehia bin Al Hacii, (2) Yehia bin Yehia Ashshaif, (3) Sherif Abdur Rahman bin Hussein of Saba, (4) Sherif Ahmed bin Mohsin of Behan, (5) Kaii bin Ahmed of Hajaria, (6) Nasir Alabkhut, (7) Nakib Ahmed bin Yebia AinTari, (8) Said Abdulla Al Washiri, (9) the whole o: the Hashid and Bakill tribes. Also it is stated by messengers, by Sherif Abdulla Ad Damain and Hizam As Saar. Sherif Abdulla Ad Damain has lately been in friendly correspondence with this Residency. Handbook of Yemen gives details of these persons.They show that it is a strong and representative confederacy, and indicate that there is a fixed determination to depose present Iman,- who has lost all hold over tribes and clings to Turks as his ,hope, even though he may be well disposed to us and Sherif of Mecca.The Idrisi apparently is cognisant, and favourable to plot to depose ihe Imam and eject the Turks. He does not know of intention to instal a new Imam it is considered probable that he will co-operate with any Imam than the present one, and that each will be content with his own sphere of influence. Possibly due to this scheme Idrisi so far does not appear to have made much progress with Hashid and Bakill.The letters and messengers say confederacy must have some strong power behind them and they prefer British. It is not impossible that visit of S.S. &quot; Massowah&quot; to Jaizan on 24th April, the evasion of our regu-lations by many Italian dhows, the recent Italian requisitions from India for large quantity of wheat, the residence at Sanaa of Signor Caprotti and prolonged stay in Aden of Captain Perduci of Italian ship &quot; lido&quot; may have some bearing on case.The messengers state that even without our assistance action will be taken as they are committed to it; the assistance they ask for is arms and ammunition, transport and money, and to-day, 14th May, a messenger has arrived. He belongs to Kharif section of the Hashid tribe. He has brought letters from Sheikh Sarhan bin Sarhan Al Mohjani and four other Sheikhs of Kharif section. These letters confirm above intelligence, also that the movement was started about October last and has now taken definite.shape. It appears that some action has already commenced and differences reported some months ago between Imam and his son had reference thereto, the son mentioned being really Said Mahomet bin Yehia Al Hadi above mentioned ; from this correspondence and information I think we must accept the fact that Imam Yehia is totally discredited. I should be glad to receive very early order as to recognition I should give to confederacy.
