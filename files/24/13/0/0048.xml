S  g  0   R:B jj?&quot; S.T. -746CABtHETARMS 10R ABYSSINIA.Hote by the Foreign Office.The Government of Abyssinia is now in the hands of Ras Taffari, whoigr ec ently headed a successful revolution against the Anti-Ally Government of lij Yasu,     While the latter was still in power. His Majesty*s   Government succeeded in persuading the French Government to prohibit the arms traffic from Jibuti to Abyssinia for the duration of the war,Ras Taffari is, however, pro-ally and has now asked the French Government for 16,000 rifles In order to complete the subjugation of the party of Lij Yasu, which is still holding out in certain districts of Abyssinia.     The French Government having heard that such a request was about to be made suggested that the opportunity should be taken to obtain   a promise from the Abyssinian Government to order arms only through the Allied Governments and not direct from-private persons or firms.    ;The French Government state that the   Italian Government concur.The Italian Government have, however, just informed His Majesty*s Government that they are entirely opposed to the 16,000 rifles being granted&apos; and they further hold that there should be &apos;: a formal agreement between the three Powers that any application for arms from tho Abyssinian Government during the war should be refused.     &quot;Pending further discussion, the Abyssinian Government&quot;have been informed that the request for 15,000 rifles cannot be granted.The proposal of the   French Government was referred to Mr.Thesiger, His Majesty1 s Minister at Adis Abaca, who recommends that before permission is granted the&apos;whole question of the arms traffic- should be regulated.     In addition&quot;to the condition suggested by&apos;tfthe French Government Mr,Thesiger proposes(i) An absolute prohibition for any firm or private person-in Abyssinia to sell arms, with&apos; a definite penalty attached.(Id) The Abyssinian Government to hand&apos;over an equal number   of old rifles for destruction in return for each consignment of new rifles.-&apos;.&quot;.- Mr.Thesiger attaches great importance&apos;to tho latter oon-dition as&apos; otherwise,&apos; ho considers,tho trade on&apos; the frontier in rifles will continue unabated. He suggests that compensation might perhaps be granted for rifles thus returned.The Sub-0&apos;dmmittee of the&apos;Oommittoe of imperial Defence on Arms Traffic,, in their: report of March 10th,- 1917 (p.3) recommended two further conditions which had been proposed &quot;by Mr. Thes iger at&apos; an earlier date.     These were:(1) that when a tender has been accepted, the; Abyssinian Government shall place&apos; the business
with the Bank of- Abyssinia for completion.( ) the establishment of a, fixed number oi cartridges to every rifle bought by the Abyssiiilan Government,If the refusal of the 1.3,000 rifles is tc be reconsidered, it seems hardly necessary to insist on these two last conditions for this special case.(Initialled.)PQBBIOT 0F2IC2, May 17th,1917.
