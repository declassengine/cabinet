SECRET.G.T.74SD. WAR   C A B I I! E T.THE IRISH QUESTION.(Copy of a letter from Mr.William 0&apos;Brien to the Prime Minister, dated 17th May 1917).Dear Mr.Lloyd George,In reply to your letter of yesterday afternoon, I have no difficulty about giving, for the information of the Cabinet, the view of my friends and myself aa to your Irish proposals.I have already repeatedly declared myself unalterably opposed to any scheme of Partition, and therefore need not discuss the suggestion for its revival in a Government Bill.As to the alternative suggestion of a Convention or Conference of Irishmen of all classes and creeds to draft a constitution for Ireland, my friends and myself are, of course, prepared to give a hearty support to the Government in giving effect to a principle we have so long contended for,   subject to the discussion of details on Monday next.Sincerely yours,(Sgd)   WILLIAM 0&apos;BRIEF.
