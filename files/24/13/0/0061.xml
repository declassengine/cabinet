ISFrom Viceroy, Foreign Department, it ill May 1917. (Received at India Office, 10 30 p.m.)Secret. Mahsuds.. Your telegram of the 15th instant. My telegram of the 11th instant summarised situation and our policy for dealing with it up to that date. Commander-in-Chiefs telegram 31592; dated 13th May, was merely intended to intimate that as precautionary measure (vide our Army telegram 8999, dated 12th May) necessity of withholding certain troops ear-marked for East Africa and Egypt in view of general Frontier situation and possibility of punitive operations against certain Mahsud sections being found necessary. This question is now under our careful consideration and we shall telegraph our proposals shortly.
