WAR CABINETProvision of Native Labour from Overseas. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,With reference to War Cabinet 136 (a) I beg to report that the labour question is a comparatively simple one as far as obtaining coloured labour is concerned.   We oan enlist all that we want, but we cannot get   them transported when enlisted to the various fields of operation.The following are the demands for labour and substitution at present unsatisfied -France 119,000Salonika 6t000Egypt 1,000Mesopotamia 4*000Towards this number we have actually got enlisted the following:-China 6,000India 9,000British WestIndies. 3,000and for these, as far as I know, with the exception of the 6,000 coolies enlisted and the 6,000 still to be enlisted to oomplete our fir9t demand of 35,000 from China, and 3,000 men from the West Indies, no provision can be made by the Admiralty for their transportation, *I have left out the question of labour in East Afrioa because that is of an exceptional kind.   It is not the ordinary labourer that is required there but carriers for transport purposes, and without them it is impossible to continue operations. These men are now very difficult to obtain.   One source of supply is from West Africa which, as the First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out the other day, means a long passage, dangerous from the point of submarine attack.Our area of recruiting in East Africa itself is comparatively limited owing to the fact that the Portuguese Government has not yet sanctioned recruiting in their territory H. of latitude 22.     If the Portuguese Government will give the necessaiy authority the Witwatersrand Hative Labour Association will undertake the recruiting of carriers for the Army,An important demand for Overseas labour, as far as the Army is concerned, is for men skilled in Forestry.   I leave those figures out of thi9 memorandum as Lord Curzon will deal with them in the report he is making on the Forestry Situation in this Kingdom.,       _,__With_* The Admiralty report that, with the exception of a number of ships already en routo via the Cape, Chinese coolies are carried by the Trans Pacific route and that the cargo shut out by them on the liners from the Par East to Vancouver is immaterial and that on the Trans Atlantic linos inappreciable.   The War Office,. therefore propose to continue to import Chinese coolies by this route.
With regard to India, instructions were given by the War Cabinet to the Secretary of State for India to secure Labour Battalions and Lumber-men from India (See G.T.729).   I was not aware that such instructions had been given until so informed by the Secretary of State for India.    *It is of course very desirable to get men of both these classes, and 3,000 are now on their way to Prance.I should suggest, therefore, that the question of the Labour Battalions and Lumber-men from India should remain in abeyance for the present.To eum up, the whole question of coloured labour for whatever theatre of war it is required, is not one of supply, which is ample, but of transport ** *Knowing as I do the difficulties of the Admiralty in this direction, I hesitate to press for all those facilities in this direction which I require, but I do think it is very desirable that the Admiralty should consider how far they oan meet my wishes in this respect.     For be it remembered that if we can get coloured labour to do the work in Prance, it not only means that we need send no more white labour there, but that we may even withdraw labour for service in England, and thus assist industry and increase the output of men fit for General Service.The question of labour in Prance is very much complicated by the fact that we have had to withdraw our German Prisoners behind the 30 kilometres line.     That means that their place has to be taken in a more forward area by labour sent from this country.     I may, however, be able to secure that some of these Prisoners may be sent back for service in agriculture in this country, and I shall enquire into that matter during my visit to Prance at the end of this week.DERBY*18th May, 1917.f*&amp;:        Since Jhe afeove was written the Ministry of ShipDinc state, as regards the increase in the number of Coolies to bf conveyed from China it has recently been necessarv to withdraw from eastern paters several ships which have beenvemployed in the carriage of Chinese Coolies,, for urgent Service elsewhere      Use is being made of every available ship on the Tran pa i I &quot;route and enquiries are being made with the object, if possible   of employing Japanese Steamers for this purpose.
