intelligence  Bureau*Department of Information.Report on Poland, May 19,Hews about Poland in the British press lias been scant as usual; even the few wires we have are obviously sent by people incapable of valuing the news they get.An Amsterdam wire in the Westminster Gazette of May 17 states that the Warsaw press is&quot;discueeing the question of the accession of a Polish King&quot;, whilst the radicals demand the declaration of a Republic.    &quot;A deadlock has been reached between Berlin and Vienna on this subject.    Possibly the Emperor of Austria^ brother Hax will be appointed Regent, although Prince Bit el, the Kaiser&apos;s second son, iisalso mentioned as a candidate.11The deadlock in that matter is even older than the Pro-is lamat ion of November 5, 1916 and the talk about individuals may-be dismissed as idle gossip.     Apparently however the question of appointing a Hegent or a King for Poland is now being seriously considered by the Central Powers as a means of consolidating con-altions in Poland and as a way out of the new difficulties whioh seem to have arisen between them and the Poles.     Since November o the Central Pbwers have triad to raise an army in Poland, the Polish &quot;activists&quot; to obtain full control of tne government and to restrict as much as possible the sphere of action of the occupying authorities; as to the future Polish army the activists wished to see it controlled by a Polish government.     These problems were still further complicated by disagreements between the Central Powers   themselves.       In the beginning of April, after three months of negotiations, a compromise seemed to have been reached. Austria-Hungary handed over the Polish Legions to von Beseler, the German Governor-General of Warsaw, to be made into the cadres fortoe future Polish army.    Simultaneously the Central Powers agreedt9 - ;
to concede to the Polish Council of State the administration ef education and justice.    Polish public opinion had wished the legions to be assigned to the Council of State, not to the German Governor-General; the German plan was finally accepted by the Council of State, probably because Germany refused to agree to any othsr solution, and also because the handing over of the administra-tion of justice and education to the Council of State was a valuable consideration and marked an important step in the develop-ment of the Polish government.     In the original Austro-German scheme of November 26, 1916 the Polish Council of State appeared merely as a deliberating and advisory assembly; it was now to be changed definitely into a governing body exercising, at least within   a certain province, authority over both spheres of occupation.It was to be expected that the principles thus agreed uponwould be modified when translated into practice; that Beseler,having to build up the Polish army with the co-operation of thePolish Council of State, would make concessions, and that on theother hand the occupying authorities, especially the Austrians,would by raising technical difficulties, delay the handing over ofeducation and justice.     Haggling about details was therefore   &apos;clearly still in store but difficulties surpassing what had beenexpected seem as a matter&quot; of fact to have arisen and to have ledto a new deadlock.    Possibly also the Council of State does notflare to carry out the agreement against the opposition of the &quot;Left&quot;..It was reported from Warsaw in the Cracow Czas, under date ofApril 26, that on April 21 in a secret session the Council of Statedecided to publish a call for volunteers for the army.     On May 1the Cracow Haprzod stated in a Warsaw despatch of April 30 withmarked emphasis that &quot;so far the Council of State has not publisheda call for volunteers&quot;; nor has there been any further news in thePolish press up to May 7 about that call.     The news service inthe British press about Poland is exceedingly bad - for the sake ofpropaganda&quot;, though it is not.clear for whose benefit thispropaganda
propaganda is made, it sometimes suppresses disagreeable news which anyhow reaches all the rest of the world through other channels. Yet it would seem that had the Polish Council of State published a call for volunteers for the army this news would have appeared at least in some British papers.     It may therefore be assumed that although almost six weeks have passed since the Legions were officially declared the cadres of a future Polish army, the step which was.expected to follow immediately on that declaration has not yet been taken.     Such deadlocks must naturally repeat them-selves as long as it is attempted to solve piecemeal the question of the relative share to be assigned In the government of Poland to the Poles and to the occupying Powers.     At bottom these attempts at agreement in detail merely cover up fundamental dis-asreements.    Hence whenever an impasse is reached in detailm the idea naturally recurs of settling first the fundamental question of the supreme government, and then letting consequences of the settlement be drawn in practice.     If therefore the above inter-pretation of what has been happening in Poland since April 10 is correct it would seem likely that in order to hasten the building of the Polish State and Poliah army and also in order to supply a stronger basis for their further development an attempt is being made to settle the fundamental problem of the government.    An authority is to be established which in its own nature would reconcile the claims of all the three factors - the Poles, Austria and Germany - and give a uniform direction to the further develop-ment of the Polish State.It seems likely that Count Kertling&apos;s recent visit to Vienna was concerned among other things with the question of selecting a Polish King.     There are proofs that also on several occasions in 1915 and 1916 the Bavarians tried to mediate between Vienna and Berlin in the Polish Question.     They may perhaps hope hy keeping present at those negotiations to come out of them as the tertius gau&amp;ens.     A Wittelsbach as-a liege prince of the German Empire but by relationship and sympathy closely connected with the HabBburgsand
and by religion allied with the Poles, might in the end prove the only candidate on which all three parties would agree, though none with enthusiasm.     It is significant that Emperor Charles after having seen Count Kertling in the morning of April 29 and after having entertained him to lunch, received in the afternoon in special audiences Count Csernin and Prince Olgierd Czartoryski, a son-in-law of Archduke Charles Stephen.     This archduke who lives in Galicia and speaks Polish is generally considered the Habsburg candidate for the Polish throne.About Galician affairs it has been reported in the British press that a new crisis has broken out in the Austrian government on account of disagreements with the polish Parliamentary Club and that His Excellency M. de 3ilinski has resigned the CBairman-ship of that Club.    The crisis in the Austrian Cabinet about the middle of April has had a German and a Polish side.     The German crisis was settled with comparative ease on April 19 (cf. weekly report on Austria of May 5).      The Polish crisis lasted more than a week longer and even then was merely adjourned and aot settled. What adds to its bitterness is that it is not caused by one single act of the Austrian government but is the result of a series of disappointments and wrongs which the Galician Poles have suffered in the course of the last three years.     On the outbreak of the rrar they had come out&quot;enthusiastically on the Austrian side on the understanding that Russian and Austrian Poland were to be united and formed into a third part of the Dual Monarchy.     This pro-gramme   has since been definitely rejected by Germany and in Polish circles it is believed that the failure was largely due to mismanagement on the part of the Austrian government.     When the original programme was publicly abandoned on November 5, 1916 the Galician Poles were promised as compensation a wide enlargement of autonomy within their own province.     The Polish Parliamentary Club insisted that this should be accompanied by a fair settlement of the economic claims of Galicia.    Galicia has continually been the scene of fighting and has suffered immense damages.    Afterhaving recovered most of the lost territory in Galicia the Austriangovernmentgovernment not merely failed to compensate the war damages and helpin
government not merely failed to compensate the war damages and help in the reconstruction of the country as it was hound to do by law, but has not even paid for all that its own armies have requisitioned.     It further continued to take from the ruined country its remaining food supplies for the army and also for the benefit of the western provinces.     Lastly the administration of the country which for the last fifty years had been in the hands of Polish statesmen is now in the hands of Austrian-German generals - they alone can be expected to carry on government on the above principles and even not all of them see their way to do so.    On March 2, 1917, Baron von Diller resigned the governorship of Galicia because he refused to sanction any further requisition-ing of food.Under these circumstances even the Polish Club in the Vienna Parliament, a tame and submissive body, has become restive.     When on April 16, after having worked for almost half a year on pro-posals for the exclusion of Galicia and for a financial and economic settlement, the polish members were told that the matter was &quot;off&quot;, an acute crisis resulted.     The Galician Poles seem now to insist on obtaining a guaranteed minimum both of financial compensations and of political privileges:   an agreement with the Austrian Government concerning the exclusion of G alicia would of course in no way prejudice the chances of obtaining still more favourable political conditions at the coming Peace Congress.On April 25th the Government of Count.. Clam-Mar tin ic promisedthat it would work &quot;in all seriousness&quot; for the realisation of the&quot;Imperial Patent&quot; of November 4, 1916, and would enter immediatelyinto negotiations about it with the Polish Parliamentary Club,&quot;consider the programme which this Club is going to put before it,and pay regard to it as far as it will be possible&quot;.     If furtherpromised to Galicia favourable economic arrangements for the future,payment
-payment for war damages and immediate compensation forwar services. The declaration finishes with a confession and apology: &quot;If the war carries, with it many hardships and sacrificedi the Government flashes to spare the hard-hit population of Galicia anything which might he considered unnecessary regour, mistrust or unfriendliness.&quot;In-answer to that declaration the Polish Club decided to maintain an expectant attitude; it directed its executive committee in their negotiations with the government to keep to the decisions arrived at by the Parliamentary Committee; reserved its final decision concerning its future attitude making it dependent on the result of the negotiations with the government; decided that a full meeting of the Polish Parliamentary Club should take place between May -10 - 15 and that in conjunction with that meeting another meeting should be held of all Polish members of the Austrian Parliament and of the Galician Diet, and that this meeting should consider the Polish Question as a whole; and finally demanded &quot;an immediate change in the unfavourable and offensive treatment which the authorities have meted out to the Polish population since the beginning of the war&quot;.The resignation.of Bilinski, the President of the polish&apos;Parliamentary Club obviously comes as the result of the plenaryPolish meeting, but it seems more likely that it is caused byProblems concerning the Polish Question as a whole than by ex-clusively Galician questions.     Bilinski is a typical Galicianbureaucrat, statesman and courtier.     Since 1892 he has helddifferent ministerial posts and at the outbreak of the war wasjoint Austro-Eungarian Minister of Finance and Minister for Bosnia.He withdrew from these posts in the spring of 1915.     Informationdeceived from private Polish sources alleges that it was throughthe support of the present Austrian Emperor, that Bilinski wasable to maintain himself in office so long after the Sarajevomurder.
jnurdsr.His resignation may mean one of two things: (l) it may he the supreme measure of opposition to the Crown of which a man of his type is capable (in Ehrfurcht sterben); (2)    it may mean that a settlement with the Austrian government prepared by Bilinski has met with a strong opposition in the Polish Club, or possibly has even been rejected.Still it is to be expected that the Austrian government willba able to overcome the crisis by means of big promises and minorconcessions.     The extreme &quot;Left&quot; in the Polish Club - theSocialists, the Peasants&apos; group and a few sincere democrats -   maybreak loose and go into opposition, but the majority of the polishmembers will remain faithful to the Hofburg.     For the conservatives2 1of their type Roman Catholic Austria is the one anchor-sheet in days of storm and revolutions; and quite apart from their own class interests and prejudicesj they have to consider the fact that the &amp;ustro-Hungarian government may yet be one of the deciding factors in the final settlement of the Polish Question and that it might be most unwise for them to break a friendship which extends back for over half &quot;a century just on the eve of the most fateful decisions.LBH.     19/5/17.
