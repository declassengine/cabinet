lbWAfi CABINETRUSSIAN RESOURCES OF MUNtglO^ MHTAI3, MINERAI5 AffD FOOIgTUFFS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE.INTRODUCTORY NOTE.The annexed memoranda/ give some details of Russia^ resources in regard to Munitions of War, Metals and Minerals, Food and Fodder stuffs, Livestock.A note is prefixed on the state of the Russian Railways, because the shortcomings of the railway system must militate against the development of any vigorous export trade with any oountry in the immediate future.    There is no prospect of the Russian railways becoming even moderately efficient until the Government are able to import the quantities of locomotives, rails and care which they indicated to the Milcer Mission. For some little time after a peace is declared there will be heavy oa 11s upon the railways (a) i&apos;or purposes of demobilisation and lb) to improve the distribution of foodstuffs, coal, petroleum, etc. in European Russia.On the other hand, it would be possible. In the event of a peace with Germany, to use any shipping that is available in the Baltic for direct trade with German ports, and to ship grain, mineral oil, iron ore and manganese ore from Black Sea ports to the Mouth of the Danube for delivery by rail or river to the Central Empires.With regard to Munitions of War we merely quote certain figures obtained by tne Milner Mission,    In parts 1 - 5 of the Mission&apos;a report there is a mass of valuable information concerning Russia^ military equipment;   and we understand that the Milner Committee are in possession of Borne more recent intelligence respecting munition works and tho industries on which they depond.With regard to Metals we would call attention -(a) to the virtual monopoly of Platinum whioh Russia enjoys.    The figures which we givo have been supplied by the Geological Society.(b) to the Importance of the Caucasian supplies of manganese ore for the German steel industry, which depended largely upon this source of manganese before the war.The figures obtained by the Milner Mission show clearly that Russia will not be in a position to export Copper,   lead er Xine (three metals which she normally produces in appreciable quantities) for a considerable time to come.The production of Pig Iron and Steel has declined during the war, even if we leave out of account the furnaces of Russian Poland whioh used to produoe 400,000 tons per annum.    On the other hand there id no reason why Germany should not be supplied with large quantities of excellent iron ore from Southern Russia assuming that labour and transport facilities are forthcomingc   &apos;j E 0 R IIFi5.%. nrHot circulated.
The figures for Coal and Coke show that Russia has &quot;been unable to increase her output of coal, or to maintain her output of coke,, in spite of the urgent demand for such an increase,     The inefficiency of the railways is in part attributed to the bad quality of coal available-     It has been found necessary to substitute petroleum fuel for ccal wherever possible-..     Though the effect of the war has been to make Russia dependent on. the Donetz coal-basin for practically all supplies, this is the largest coalfield in Europe.     The ooal is there,,    What Russia lacks is modern plant, skilled workmen and rolling stock to transport the output.     These deficiencies will not easily be made good.The figures for Oil production and export are only complete to the end of 1915,     The violent fall of experts in 1914, and. their practical cessation In 1915 do not appear to have caused a great fall in production before that date;   the figures of the stocks at Baku in January 1316 show that the loss of the export trade was to a large extent compensated by increased domestic consumption.     But the stocks at Baku Were abnormal in 1916, and there should still be considerable reserves available for immediate export if required.     Whether G-ermany would wish to draw upon Baku is another question.     The Roumanian oil wells will be in working order in a short time, and are much more conveniently situated than those of Baku.-    But Russia might be able to supply lubricating oil, ;which would be particularly useful do Germany.. G-ermany before the war imported about 90,000 tens per annum of Russian lubricating oil.The .resources of Russia in Cereals are problematic. The forecast of the Russian Ministry of Agriculture is that the 1917 harvest in European Russia will barely suffice for the maintenance of .the army and the civil   population,   On the other hand it is probable that the old stocks still remaining in European Russia are considerable.     The old Government promised the Allies 40 million poods (640,000 tons) of wheat and rye in February;    and they thought that this quantity might be increased to 50 million poods,       In the event of peace with Germany the high prices which Germany would offer for grain of any kind would soon bring- to light any concealed stocks .   Professor Struve, the Chairman cf the Restriction of Enemy Supplies Committee has expressed the opinion (February 1917) that such stocks are   being held for a rice in prises.   It must also be remembered that the Ministry of Agriculture anticipate a surplus of 2.35 million tons on the Asiatio harvest.   Under war conditions it would be impossible to transport this surplus tc Europe; but after tho conclusion of peace Germany might find ways and means.     The Siberian railway would be no longer con-geoted with westbound freights of munitions and military supplies.
Some- figures are given to show the main Russian exports of Foodstuffg. Fodders tuffs and Livestock before the war. It is&quot; no terror thy &quot;that&quot; Russia habitually exports butter and oleaginous seeds on a large scale; there are no foodstuffs of which Germany is mere in need.   Sir G. Buchanan reported, however, in September 1916 that Russia would be unable tc export butter for some time to come.The reopening of trade communications v/ith Russia would be a boon to the German linen industrjr which, before the war, wan largely dependent on Russian supplies of Flax.   &apos;The authorities used in preparing the following memoranda are*-Statitchesky Yedjegodnik Rossy, 1912.Statesman&apos;s Year Book 1917 ( &amp; previous years)Russian Year Boo^ 1916.Statistisches Jahrbuch fur das Deutsche Reich 1915 ( &amp; previous years).Statistical Abstract of the Principal and Other Foreign Countries (Board of Trade 1914).Report for the Year 1913 on the Trade cf the Consular District of Batoum.Report for the Year 1912 cn the Trade of the Consular District of OdessacReports for the Years 1912 and 1913 on the Foreign Commerce of Russia.,Times Russian Supplements.(Sgd)    H.W.
