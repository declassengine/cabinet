3/ 08SECRETWAR:   CABIKST.&amp;.T.774Propaganda at Hone.-Memorandum by the Director^ Department q  Information.To the Prime Minister.When the Department of Information was founded by a resolution of the War Cabinet^ on the 20th February, no pro-vision was made for the work of propaganda at home, except in so far as the War Cabinet might direct certain information to be issued to the British Press.In the present state of. popular feeling I am very strongly of opinion that it is necessary to do a considerable amount of propaganda in Britain itself.      The papers are small in si&amp;e, and, owing to the almost entire cessation of puhlio-^jreaking, one of the best means of informing the country is in abeyance. At the same time, the need was never greater for instruction and encouragement.     I em anxious to be allowed to organise various lines of direct propaganda in this country, and , in particular a series of lectures and addresses in all the chief contres.We are sending a considerable number of Labour Deputa-tions to view the re-occupied territories.      i should like to arrange for these men, when they return, to lecture in their own districts, and to illustrate their lectures with our official films and slides,      I would also propose to draw largely upon Membfers of Parliament who have, at the moment, not very much to, do, and who, I think, would be willing to help.    We could give every assistance in the way of inform motion,   illustrations and booklets.     It seems a pity not to organise the results of the numerous visits we arrange to the. British front,     The expenditure on&apos;such a scheme would not, be. large;   but I do not think the Treasury could sanction it without a resolution of the War Cabinet, as, strictly speaking, such, work does not; come within the province of my Department at present.(Signed)   JOHN BUCHA1U18th May.,1917 .
