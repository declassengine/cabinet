ILSECRETFAB CABINET.SHE IRISH QUESTION(Copy of letter from Lord Midleton to the Prime Minister dated.. 18th May 1917).Dear Prime Minister,In accordance with your invitation I have conferred with some of my friends representing the South and Vest of Ireland who are at the moment available in London, and on their behalf I have the honour to submit the following observations upon the alternative proposals for the settlement of the Irish question formulated by the Government.We consider that the measure of Home Rule proposed to be granted to a part of Ireland by agreement between the Parlia-mentary Parties would involve grave Imperial dangers.The Sinn Fein movement has, since the Rebellion of Easter Week, 1916, gained immensely in strength.     Its operations are actively seditious and pro-German, and its declared aim is an Irish republic.     Its power under the existing franchise is manifested by the results of the recent Rosoommon and Longford Elections, and there is grave reason to fear that under the proposed extension of the franchise this power will be strengthen-ed, as there has been a. marked tendency for1 the younger generation to adhere to this movement.7*e deprecate on principle any division of Ireland but we are further convinced that as proposed it would enormously increase the foroes of disloyalty, and imperil safety, while not effecting the settlement of the Irish question desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government, ;ne can therefore give no support to the. above proposal, but should the Government proceed with it on the assumption that it commands a &quot;second reading acceptance from both Irish Parties&quot;. ie hold that it .;ould be essential to provide the.fullest possible representation of Imperial feeling, and that provision, should be made to secure adequate membership for the Unionists of the South and -est of Ireland in any new bodies which may be set up, and to safeguard many Imperial and other interests which are jeopardised by the Act of 1914.With regard to the &quot;alternative plan&quot; of assembling immediately &quot;a Convention of Irishmen of all Parties for the purpose of drafting a Constitution for their country&quot; we desire again to emphasize our conviction, confirmed by the experience of the Far, that Imperial Government under the Union is the only form of Government to which the control of Ireland can be safely committed.  ;&apos; ^ith a view, however, to minimise existing diffi-cultieo:and to secure the full participation of Ireland in the War, 7/e are prepared to submit the proposal to the Irish Unionist Alliance,They expressed last year their readiness to enter into the ieliberations of &quot;a Conference on the future government of the
I -394- 2 -Empire after the expiration of the ^ar with an open mind^inthe hope that the question might.&quot;be settled -on hr-oad; and Imperiallines which would embrace the whole of Ireland, and we havereason to believe they would be willing to take part in sucha Convention if it is fully representative of all interests, andif it is clearly understood that its proceedings are subject tothe review of the Imperial Parliament-.Yours faithfully,(Sgd)L1IDLET0H.
