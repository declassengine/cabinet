a       N.S.V.A. 57-National Service Department(AGRICULTURAL SECTION.)Arrangements for Harvest and -other work on the Land by Public and Secondary School Masters and Boys.The Director-General of National Service and the Presi-dent of the Board of Agriculture have accented the offer of the Cavendish Association to place its organisation at their disposal for the purpose of arranging harvest and other work on the land in conjunction with:  - &apos;- &quot;The Public and Secondary National Union of Teachers.Schools. - War Office.Civil Servants. Board of Agriculture.Clergy National Service  - Board of Education.Committee. . .&apos;    Army Canteen Committee,ree Church Council.     I &apos;A Central Harvest Committee. has been formed at St. Eimin&apos;s London representative of . these organisations by which the general arrangements for the effectual working of lhe Scheme have been drawn.up, and the Director-General of National Service has appointed the Cavendish Association to i:arry&apos; out these arrangements under the: supervision of the Director of the Agricultural Section of the&apos;National Service Department.The Director General&apos;s Appeal. -The Director General has issued an appeal to parents in which lie says that he looks to the elder boys from, Public and Secondary Schools as &amp; reserve of labour. It is impossible so early in the season to ascertain to what extent this reserve of labour will be required. Enquiries are now being made of the farmers, and it is hoped that a general indication of their requirements will be obtained by June. 15th.Schools will be apprised at the earliest possible moment, but as many farmers will send in their requests, for labour at very short notice, it is hoped that volunteers will be enrolled at the beginning of the term in such a way that squads of boys may be formed and sent out quickly.General Arrangements.The following are the special arrangements drawn up for Public and Secondary Schools after consultation with repre-sentatives of the Headmasters&apos; Conference and the Headr masters&apos; Association :-(1) Public, and Secondary School Masters and Boys are, invited to volunteer for seryice^ (a) During term time,   (b) During the holidays.Wt. 8512.  419!   5,000.   U.G. &amp; S., Ltd.   15/5/17.
(2) Boys should be organised in squads, each squad bein^ in charge of an assistant master as squad manager. Such squads to be of varying numbers according to requirements. I is anticipated that squads will outnumber the squad managers available. For work during the holidays it is therefore hoped to find Preparatory School Masters and others willing to mana^ Public and Secondary School squads. The assistance of those not physically fit for hard work will be welcomed for this pui-pose. It is very important that squads should be in charge oi responsible persons, and it is hoped that they will be so formed that in each there will be one or more- elder boys (monitors 01 sixth form boys).(3) The following are the methods for billeting am&quot; catering: (a) Large squads in central places. Central squads will serve several neighbouring farms, going to and fro by bicycle or other means. Such squads will be billeted under canvas or in schools, halls, institutes, barns, hotels, village inns, country houses where possible (occupied or unoccupied), and similar places. Squads billeted in unoccupied buildings-will be provided with camp equipment. Such squads as possess tenU and camp equipment could to a large extent arrange for theii own billeting. All members of squads, including the mana-gers, should, if possible, take bicycles with them. Member? of squads will be expected to assist in the running of billets i.e., making beds, serving meals, etc.(b) Small squads with farmers, and, where possible, wit] local residents.(c) The members of each squad will share the expense oi catering for such squad, the payments received in wages i* go towards such expenses. It is estimated that the cost of catering for each squad will be from 15s. to 18s. per head pei week.Schools will undertake arrangements for catering, and perhaps will be able to take with them members of their staffs housekeepers, cooks, and men for odd jobs. Where possible local assistance will be obtained from Boy Scouts and others but it must not be relied upon.(4) In cases where the total wages earned by the squad have not sufficed for the total expenses of catering, application may be made by the squad manager to the Central Harvest Com-mittee. Such applications will be carefully considered, and if approved recommendations will be made to the National Service Department, who are prepared to make good such losses up to a maximum of 5s. per head per week for such boys as an certified by managers to have done a full week&apos;s work.(5) Free railway warrants will be provided for volunteers undertaking work for two consecutive weeks in term time, or
three consecutive weeks in the holidays. &quot;Warrants for squads will be forwarded on application to the Secretary, Central Har-vest Committee, as soon as definite railway arrangements have been made.   These warrants will provide free railway facilitiesonly  .. . . . j&quot;(1) From place of residence to place of work, directroute. ,(2) From place of work to next destination. -.(6) Squads will not be asked to do any work under this Scheme on Sundays.(7) The limit of age of boys desiring to volunteer is 16. School authorities may, however, accept applications from boys of 15 if such boys are exceptionally strong for their age, and in the opinion of the School Authorities are capable of doing the work. But in all cases only boys physically fit for hard work should be accepted.(8) All applications should be for as long a period as possible. The shortest period for which offers should be accepted during the holidays is three weeks.(9) No boy, unless exceptionally strong, will be asked to ih the full day&apos;s work of an agricultural labourer. Squad managers will arrange with farmers the amount of work to be undertaken by each boy.(10) Boys will receive the current rate of wages applicable to the locality, i.e., 3d. to 4d. per hour. All payments must he made to squad managers. Boys w&quot;ill only be paid for work done. When not employed through wet weather, or for other reasons, they will receive no pay.(11) Squads for fruit picking are included in the Scheme, and also for forestry if such are found to be wanted this year.(12) The National Service Department cannot undertake any responsibility for loss of luggage, etc., or for accidents.. TERM TIME WORK.Many schools have already made arrangements with farmers in their own immediate neighbourhoods for term time work, and also for horticultural work, and there is no desire to interfere with such activities.For schools that have not at present been able to make arrangements, or are prepared to undertake additional work, the following methods of work are suggested: (1) Squads going to and fro from their school by bicycle or short train journey.(2) Squads billeted within easy train journey of the school.
Schools which are able to send squads of boys for work-in billets during term time in their own neighbourhood should communicate with the Secretary, Central Harvest Committee. St. Ermin&apos;s-, London, S.W., at once, stating the number erf boys available and the length of time for which squads will be permitted to work. As it is very often difficult for farmers to know in advance the exact date upon which they require labour, it would be a great assistance if arrangements coul.1 be made early in the term so that squads could be available at. a day or two&apos;s notice.HOLIDAY WORK.It is hoped that all school boys employed in Harvest and other work on the land will, if necessary, be given leave oi absence from school to the end of September. Applications from boys for holiday work should be for as long a period as possible. The shortest &apos;time for which offers should he accepted is three weeks.Work in Neighbourhood of School.It is desirable for boys wishing to work during the holi-days, and whose homes are close to the school they attend, that they should continue to work with the farmers for whom the\ have been working during term time. It is suggested, there-fore, that arrangements should be made by the School Authori-ties for squads of such boys to continue for stated periods during the holidays.Work Not in the Neighbourhood of School.The demands for holiday labour for squads desiring to work away from the neighbourhood of their school will be sent to the Schools as soon after the 15th of June as possible. In the meanwhile it would greatly assist the organisation of this Scheme if returns could be made to the Secretary, Central Harvest Committee, St. Ermin&apos;s, London, S.W., giving the approximate number of boys who will be available.It is anticipated that these demands will be for squads oi varying numbers, and for periods of from 4 to 8 weeks. Tin School Authorities are asked to make such arrangements wiili the boys that all squads are kept at full strength for the period for which they are engaged, and that all boys should work for the full three weeks&apos; period. All volunteers should rememhei that the value of their work is infinitely greater during the lasi fortnight when their muscles are set and they have learnt their work.Printed in Great Britain by The Avenue Press (L.
