Report to the Cabinet,19th Mey, 1917.General        I. -Che situation as regards development of thePolicy. 200 h.p, Rispano-Suisa engine, to which reierenoe waamade in the last Report, continues to give ground for anxiety, having regard to the extreme importance of these engines in the programme of the supply of aircraft to the squadrons at the Front.    A remedy had not, by last Wednesday, been found for the defective design of the crankshaft oi this engine and the Board accordingly arranged ior a speoiaX conference, presided over by Mr. Martin, i*he Controller of Petrol Engines in the Ministry of Munitions, at Messrs. nolseley&apos;8 works at Birmingham to consider how best to deal with the situation. As a result, a number of minor alterations have been suggested which it is believed will make the engine, of whioh a large number are partially manufactured, fit for servioe.    Meanwhile experiments are taking plaoe to ascertain whether the engines already manufactured can be satisfactorily run at a rather lower speed than they were designed to develope,II. The Board have reoeived a communication from&apos; the Aircraft Production Board of the United states Government asking for the supply of a number of models of aeroplanes and requesting that arrangements should be made with the proprietors of certain types of aircraft and engines in this Country for licences to manuiacture in America.   The contents of this communication are such as to suggest grave doubts as to the wisdom oi the policy on which the American Aviation Authorities appear to be embarking.    A conference on the subject was accordingly held yesterday between the Air Board and the American^ Naval and Military Attaohes and at their request a report will be furnished for communication to the American Government making suggestions as to the polioy in regardi      to the manufacture of aircraft and the training of pilots whioh it would be wise to adopt.III. Conferences tcck plaoe at the end of last week in Paris between representatives oi the Air Board, and representatives oi the Jrench and of the Italian Aviation Authorities respectively.    As a result of the conference with the French Authorities it was decided to recommend to the respective Governments that arrangements should be made for the creation in Amerioa of a joint body to co-ordinate the orders tor aeronautical material of the British, ireach and American Governments./
