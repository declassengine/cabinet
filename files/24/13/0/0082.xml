SECRETWAR CABINET.G.T.780RECRUITING- FOR THE ARMY.(Copy of letter from Lord Derby to the Prime Minister dated 19th May 1917).My dear Prime Minister,X enclose a copy of the answer I am prepared to give to Lord Meath in the House of Lords next Thursday.   Perhaps you will kindly iook through it and let me have your approval. Personally, I am convinced that the only satisfactory way of dealing with the matter is to begin at the age of 19 and take the whole of the men of that age, irrespective of their employssa&amp;t, and so gradually work up.     I do not believe in the demoralisation of the various industries being caused by such a course being adopted.     i am sure it would demoralise them far less than our having to pick out men here and there of all ages and taking them, and I do hope that you will favourably consider this idea.The other reforms in our recruiting which 1 mentioned are, I think, equally imperative, especially the revision of the eon-stitution of the Tribunals.     They are working very badly now, and I don!t hesitate to say that S0% of the ordinary Tribunals of the Country are failing in their work at the present moment.Yours sincerely,(Sgd)     DERBY.ENOIQSUBE.MEMORANDUM.The Question can be divided into two parts, first what steps will have to be taken to secure the 500,000 men that Sir William Robertson stated, on behalf of the Army Council, were necessary for us to obtain by July, and by July he meant the end of July, and the second part is what hopes we entertain of getting this number.I hope the Noble Lord will forgive me if I speak at some length on this subjeot as a bald answer to these two points would I think give rise to a misunderstanding.When the Noble Lord asks what steps we have taken to secure the men I presume he means what action other than that given by the Military Service Acts we have had to put into force.   So far only three measures have had to be taken - one Legislative the other two Administrative.The Legislative is the Bill for seouring re-examination of those who have been medically rejected.The two Administrative   are contained in-(a)   a circular by Lord Rhondda, President of the Local Government Board asking Tribunals to revise all their temporary exemptions and(b)   the alteration in the system of Trade Card exemptions.
On all these three points I should like just to say a for words!.First with regard to Medical re-examination.   There are people, many .of ^whom should know &quot;better, who are endeavouring to stir Up agitation against this measure on the ground that wc are compelling men who have been permanently invalided out of the Service for wounds to again come forward so that we can take them into the Army and send them out to Franco.    There is not a word of truth in that.    I admit that such a Clause was in the original Bill but as soon as ever it was pointed out that this.might and indeed would confer a great hardship on many men it was deleted from the Bill and no man who has been permanently invalided because of disablement resulting from wounds (including injury from poisonous gas) received in battle or as a consequence cf neurasthenia will be coinpulsorily taken for the Army,  although it is hoped that many cf those who have now recovered from their wounds will come forward voluntarily to give their services.    By the elimination however of this olause and by the introduction cf certain complications in administration we estimate we lest at least 40,000 men who would be perfectly capable of doing 3ome sort of military service at home even if not fit to go abroad.   The Noble Lord-may ask why were they permanently discharged?   The reason I give is one that I am afraid pervaded many of our actions in the early stages of the Y&quot;ar and it was that it was not anticipa-ted,  except by very few,  that the War would last as long as it has lasted, or that those who were fit for Home service would be almost as valuable as those who are fit for foreign service. There was also the fact that the organisation of Command Depots and Convalescent Homes that v/e now have at-our disposal did not than exist and we were unable to keep men until such time as they were so completely recovered as to be fit for service. I only state that as being a justification for our having included this clause in the first instance but I hope that the Noble Lords and the Press will make it quite clear that those people ( and there are some Members of Parliament amongst them) who are asserting that v/e are under the Act taking wounded men fftio have been discharged on account of battle wounds arc deliberately lying.Now as to those whom we do expect to get under this Act. When I was introducing the Bill to your lords&apos;wip&apos;s House I stated, that there were a great many men who received exemption on medical grounds at the commencement of the War who would certainly not receive it now.   Again I have to refer to public opinion that the War would soon be over.    Only men who were absolutely fit for General service abroad were then taken . Be it said to their honour that a great many men who were rejeot-ed at one place -vent on trying somewhere else until the:/ were accepted, but on the other hand a great many did not.   They simply received an attestation form marked with &quot;Rejected&quot; across, it with no reason assigned for such/&apos;
rejection and with no signature showing who was the Medical Officer concerned and we know of such cases as men being rejected through sprained ankles, recovering from influenza, etc. - men who&quot;are new perfectly fit to take their place in the ranks.     There were also two other categories.     There were the men who had obtained medical rejections by fraud.     Your lordships have seen that we have already had several successful prosecutions and we are instituting more and I am afraid that before we have finished the Country and the Medical Profession will have some disagree-able and painful surprised with regard to this form of exemption. There were alec the cases which seem very amusing now to look back on.     In the old days there existed Class Battalions in -the Territorial Roree and to a certain extent in the iiegular Army there were conditions attached to various regiments and men who presented themselves, who were not supposed to be of the same class as the Battalion in question, were rejected not because of their class but because very often the doctors did not like to give offence and so rejected on medical grounds.     I estimate that we.should by means of these medical re-examinations get something like 100,000 men and I do not think I shall be very far wrong in my conclusion, although I admit that we shall not get this 100,000 by the end of July.So much for Legislative action.     Hew for the Administrative. The first is Lord BhonddaTs appeal to the Tribunals to reconsider temporary exemptions.     This was very necessary.     Again the same thing has to be mentioned, the belief in the short duration of the War and the non-reccgnition of the fact that all men who could possibly be spared from national work should be spared.     The Tribunals were, if I may say so, .icy own creation under the Voluntary system.     They, to my mind, were the best method we had of getting a democratic as opposed to a bureaucratic super-vision of what recruits we should take.     By the two Military Service Acts they were recognised as Statutory Bodies and I regret to say that they have not been an unqualified success.There are some Tribunals which are very good - and that epithet can be applied to most of the Appeal Tribunals, but there are others which have been very bad.     Men have secured exemption not because they could not be spared but because they were the sons of their fathers and those fathers had considerable local Influence.And more than this.     It is very hard indeed on sny man who is.a Member of Parliament or of Public Bodies elected by vote to entirely disregard the wishes of those who support him and I should like to eliminate from all Tribunals any man who is for any position dependent on the votes of those whose cases he may have to judge;   but to do this would mean to eliminate
eliminate- some of the very best men, although I admit ax the same time, it would eliminate some of the veryworst.There is an absence of uniformity which is often deplorable and this reacts on the whole system of recruiting throughout the length and breadth of the land.     One Tribunal does its duty without fear or favour only to find that a Tribunal nest doer is exemp-ting men in exactly the same position to those the first Tribunal is sending to the Colours* with the result that gradually instead of Tribunals levelling up to the best they level down to the worst.     I think it will have to be contemplated whether, some new method cannot be devised by which cases should be &apos;tried in other areas to those in which they come, or, some system must net be instituted, such as talk es place in Registration Courts where an.independentChairman is appointed.     This would obviate all the disadvantages &quot;of Tribunals which I ha&quot;ve mentioned. The matter is under consideration. .This brings me in the natural sequence to the second administrative act namely the revision of the Trade Card scheme,.     The Trade Card scheme wa3 instituted, to meet a particular emergency.     It was carefully considered but-unfortunately its full effect was not recognised.     I was one of those who were present at the discussion and the decision, and I frankly admit.that: if I had then seen the unfairness with which, it has acted I should not have been party to it, but I did not.     I did not see it and I do not think anybody else did and now a new scheme has been.instituted which will I hope retain in the country these men who are essential and will at the same timeliberate those who are not essential and who above all are young men fit for General Service.     I notice there is a disposition to say that the alteration was rushed /out such is not the case and I do not think too high.a tribute can be paid to Mr.Henderson the labGur&quot; Adviser of the Cabinet and to Dr,Addison the. Minister of Munitions for the great care and considera-tion that they haxa^shown to this question.     It is as your lordships knew;advanced as one of the causes of the disastrous strike which we have had and which is still with .us*    Disastrous both in the way of providing recruits for the Army who could be perfectly spared and in the provision of all those absolute essentials of V/ar which our men in the Field musfc have.I have not given an estimate of what these two Administrative actions will bring in the vfay of men because to do so would be pure guess worko     It will bring us a very large number but owing to the delay which is occurring in both cases, first in the tardiness with which Tribunals in many instances review their exemptions and secondly to the strike which has prevented the full benefit of the revision of the
Trade Card system being felt, there is no chance of our getting the number of men by the end of July which a month ago I thought would be possible,So much for the stops taken to secure the ^00,000 men, I am sure he Noble Lord will not press me as to what oxtent they will meet the 5^0,000 men asked for but I say this, and I cannot sufficiently emphasise the gravity of the situation, that the number will fall very largely dhOrt of the number named.      I am afraid I must go further.     -I do not&quot; believe that under the present system we could haVe obtained this -number by the end of July.The Noble Lord will say tc me then what steps have you taken tc remedy this deficiency and to ensure that the full strength of our available mamrood is forthcoming when and where required in order that the prosecution of the War may be continued with success.A partial remedy of our difficulty would be tc rajse the age from 41 to $1 and here let me say in passing that the new Order that:the War Office has issued allowing the voluntary enlistment of men between these ages is to allow Us legally io take many men who being above the age %%-o anxious to serve and yet have to be rejected if they speak the truth when giving their age.     Bui although this is the most simple form cf getting the men ii is not the one that appeals to me the most.     I wish to see the young men taken, although it may be that we shall also require the older men. Here I may mention one of thereat failings of Tribunals.   -In many cases they grant exemption to men who are within the latter years of the prescribed ages for compulsory service because they say young men are still left in this country. I wish they would see that both are required, not only the men of 25&quot; but the men of 41 and that a man of 2$ being released cannot be taken as a substitution for an older one retained. They both have got to go if the supply is to be kept up. Personally I do not hesitate to repeat what I have said before publicly that I should take all men beginning at 19 and move upwards regardless of their occupation but I admit there are difficulties in the way, but it is a proposal that while it has been carefully considered and has for the moment been found not practicable will I believe have to be considered again and again and finally adopted.I have also hinted that it may be necessary to consider the reconstitution of   Tribunals and that again the Government has under consideration:   lastly there will have to be considered tho decision by which a man gots two months exemption when in a certified occupation before he can be taken for the army.     I do not think that an alteration of
this rule would give us more men for the Axmy hut it would give thorn to us much more speedily.In my opinion there are still men in this coun-try sufficient to keep our essential industries going and at the same time provide large:numbers of men for the Army even if the War be prolonged for a greater time than many of us hope and believe - it will be.     The methods at present in force Will-give us a considerable percentage of thesefmen,-but&apos;they will not give us all and I am not sure that they  . deal very fairly with all, and the War Cabinet have under consideration at the present, moment such proposals both Ad-ministrative and.Legislative as will give us the fullest -supply of men that this Country can afford to give to the Army, having regard to our peculiar situation in regard to shipping, production of food, etc.I admit that my answer to the IToble Lord is not one that can give him as the questioner, or me as the answerer much satisfaction but the only thing that I do feel is this -that the Country, being determined to win the War, will take every step that is necessary;   that they want to be assured that such measures are fair to all and that the general prin-ciple on which we must all agree is that.young men first should be more insisted upon than it is at the present moment.
