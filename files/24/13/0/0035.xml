THE RELATION OF IMPOSTS TO SHIPPING,high, the gross loss of ships over 1600 tons &quot;being 503,000 tons and the net loss on &quot;balance being 306,000 tons, i.e* more than double the corresponding figure for March (168,000).   By far the greatest part of the net loss was in the last fortnight, when it aggregated 326,000 tons (the balance of 365,000 gross losses and 39,000 gains by building 5c).The gain during the month by building and acquisition was 115,000 tons, which falls a good deal short of the total (170,000 tons) for March, and the falling off is still more marked in the latter part of the month.During the first week in iiay the high rate of loss of the last half of April has not been kept up, the average net loss having been 11,000 tons a day compared with 23,000 tons a day during the preceding fortnight.Aggregate entries in April at British ports of : ships    with cargoes in the foreign trade were 17 per cent, less than in April 1916, a much less falling off than in March, when it  was 31 per cent.    Practically the whole reduction has been in foreign ships..British entrances only declined by 9,000 tons, whereas for-eign entrances declined 395,000 tons or 51 per cent.    Even the latter reduction was appreciably less than in March when it reached 65 per cent.The decline in foreign entrances is more than accounted for by neutral shipping, which fell off by 400,000 tons, while Allied entrances (including U.S.A. vessels) increased by 5,000.The tonnage of Imports in April was 2,457,000, shewing a reduction of 850,000 tons compared with April 1916.    Of this reduction 499,000 tons affected restricted imports and only 351,000 tons unrestricted imports-    This means that while re-stricted goods have declined 63 per cent,   unrestricted imports (which embrace the most essential classes of goods) have onlyfallen
fallen off 14 per cent,This is a much more satisfactory result than in March and shews that the import restriction scheme is haying a marked effect in compelling the contraction of imports which is inevitably caused by the scarcity of tonnage to operate most heavily on the less essential classes of goods.(5) It will be seen that the monthly saving of 500,000tons per month which was  not expected to be attained until later in the year has already been reached.This is due to the fact that the saving on timber im-ports has  been greatly in excess of what was anticipated by the Imports Restriction Committee.(6) :7hile however it is now clear that a greater saving ofimports will be effected during the year than the Committee expected, much more restriction will be necessary in order to reach the larger total of 1 million tons a month which the increasing gravity of the shipping situation makes it necessary to contemplate.For this additional saving a much more drastic treatment of the Timber  situation is necessary than has hitherto been found possible, both as regards economy of consumption and increase of home production.    As this matter has been re-ferred to in previous reports and is now before a special Cabinet Committee it is not necessary to enter into detail here.It may however be said generally that the import of tim-ber in April was only one third of that in April 1916 (142,000 tons compared with 430,000 tons.)   Of the total timber imports in April 97,000 tons were  pitwood. (7)        Of the 351,000 tons reduction of unrestricted imports in April 102,000 were in grain and flour (125,000 wheat and flour) 60,000 iron ore, 44,000 other ores, and 94,000 oil seeds.
