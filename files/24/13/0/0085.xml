Prom Generai&quot; De lme-Radcliffe. To        Sir William Robertson.SECRET.19/5/17.56.Secret and personal.This morning General Cadorna requested me to inform you of his grave anxiety concerning his- heavy ammunition supply.His total in hand Is about 3* million rounds.Of this he has set aside lj millions f$r the purpose of present action.   He thinks that ha must retain ? in hand reserve of li million, to meet any other possible eventuality.If he should use up more than present allowance, ho will have to suspend operations until the reserve is built up again, and regards with dismay, possibility of being forced to remain almost inactive during the best months of the summer.To-morrow, he Is sending General Porro to Rome to attend conference of Ministers, and represent danger over again, but fears that deficiency of coal and steel will make it impossible for Ministers to guarantee anything, as Italian workshops nave been producing for long time past, much less than maximum output.They cannot produce more without raw materials. General Cadorna Is anxious to hear your opinion as to effect of Russian situation, and what you think that we should be prepared for as regards increase of enemy strength, due to withdrawal from Russian front of enemy divisions.
