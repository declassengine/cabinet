any further communication should be addressed not to any individual by name, but to-The Director, Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food Production Department, 72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 1.and should quote the reference number and date of this letter.Registered Telegraphic A ddress : &quot;Growmore, Sowest, London.&quot; telephone: Victoria 8240.Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food Production Department,72, Victoria Street,\\&quot;\ London, S.W. 1.16th May, 1917.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Food Production Department for the week ended 15th May:-Appointment of Standing Committee. A. Standing Committee of the Department has been appointed to consider and make provision for all requirements for the programme of 1918, and to co-ordinate the work of the various Sections of the Department which are principally responsible for giving effect to the policy of the Government in regard to increased food production.Cultivation for 1918. Although the Department has been unable, in the continued absence of Cabinet approval to inform County Executive Committees of the extent to which additional labour, horses, machinery and other essentials will be available for preparing land for the 1918 Harvest, the majority of Committees are making preliminary and provisional arrangements to carry out the task allotted to them. . Estimates of requirements are being prepared, meetings of farmers are being addressed by members of County Executive Committees, theico-operation of land agents, farmers and others is being sought in order to promulgate the scheme, and special surveys are being instituted in order to select the areas of grass to be broken up.
I-  LOCAL ORGANISATION.Work of the Agricultural Executive Committees.The Committees are continuing their efforts with regard to the current year&apos;s cultivation, and the following instances, with reference to specific pieces of land, may be of interest.    These include action taken with a view to the crops both of 1917 and 1918. Bedfordshire - The Committee have taken possession of 49 acres at Aspley Guise, for dead fallowing, and are examining a number of small holdings in the Biggleswade district which are reported to v be in a neglected state.    They have taken action under the Drainage of Lands Order with regard to water-courses at Graveney and Ampthill. Buckinghamshire - The Committee have arranged to take possession of Coombe Farm at Ellesborough, and have taken possession of a holding of 10 acres at High Wycombe owned by Lord Lincolnshire. Essex * The Committee have taken possession of 5 small holdings or pieces of land aggregating 92 acres at Great Totham, and are cultivating this land as one holding.Leicestershire - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 200 acres at Ragdale, and to cultivate the land themselves.Suffolk, East - The Committee have decided to take possession of a farm of 148 acres at Bacton, another farm of 77 acres at Burgh, and of the whole or portions of 8 farms at Clopton, aggregating 535 acres.   They are making arrangements for the cultivation of these farms under a single supervisor.Suffolk, Hest - The Committee have arranged for the mole-draining and steam cultivation of certain lands of which they had previously taken possession.   They have also taken possession formally of a farm at Wickhambrook, and also of 70 acres at Troston, in order to enforce cultivation by the tenants.   They have taken action under
the Drainage of Lands Order for the cleaning out of mill-dams and . sluices.   They are also co-operating with the Norfolk Committee as to the drainage of lands into the River Ouse, which divides the two counties.Sussex, West - The Committee have decided to take possession of two farms aggregating 62 acres near Pulborough.Rabbits.Serious complaints having been received from several Executive Committees, notably Somerset, the East Riding and Bedfordshire, to the effect that they were unable, without compulsory powers, to secure the reduction of rabbits which were injuring crops and grass, an Order has been made empowering Agricultural Executive Committees to authorize any person to enter upon the land and to kill and take the rabbits according to directions of the Executive Committee.   The Order does not allow the setting of traps in the open, the laying of poison or the use of firearms by night.Golf Courses.Replies have been received from about 300 clubs to the letter sent on the 12th April, 1917 to over 1,100 Golf Clubs asking them, where they had land suitable for hay, to set apart as great a portion of that land as possible for that purpose In the present season.   Almost all the Clubs which have replied are co-operating in a greater or less degree in the increase of food production.    The soil of many of the courses in question is unfit for anything but grazing by sheep or cattle, but in many cases the Clubs have set aside portions for hay, some even to the extent of half the course, while many others have allowed substantial parts of their land to be cultivated with potatoes^ oats and other crops.   A summary of the replies received from the clubs in each county has been sent to the Executive Committee to consider whether any further action is desirable.
Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2).In the 917 Boroughs or Urban Districts from which the Department has received reports 162,481 applications have been made for plots under the provisions of the above Order, and 142,445 plots containing a total area of 10,502 acres have been provided.Horticultural Section. A further 49 Local Horticultural Representatives have been appointed during the week, bringing the total number of such appointments up to 232.Preservation of Fruit and Vegetables.Ehis question is of great and urgent importance, in view of the increased production that is expected this year, and as the Food Controller does not propose to deal with it, a comprehensive scheme is being prepared by this Department.    It is hoped that a summary of this may be included in next week&apos;s Report.     A class for providing practical training for instructors in bottling fruit and vegetables was begun on 14th May.    After students have completed this course they will act as teachers of&quot; groups of persons undertaking to give instruction in different parts of the country.A small scale fruit and vegetable dryer manufactured by the British Fruit Evaporator Company has been tested during the week. Although the apparatus is in most respects satisfactory it is impossible to recommend its general adoption until a suitable coke stove has been designed.Spraying of Potatoes - Orders have been received for 1360 Knapsack Sprayers, and for 6107 cases of chemicals (copper sulphate and soda), enough, that is, to use for the spraying of
about 8,000 acres twice.     The western counties, Cornwall and Devon are particularly concerned in spraying.   Cornwall has ordered 210 machines and Devon 500.   Representatives of the Department have addressed well attended meetings at Truro and Exeter.   A spraying demonstration for officers concerned with potato growing on behalf of the Army Canteen Committee was held at the Royal Horticultural Society&apos;s Gardens at Wisley on May 14th.   Brigadier-General Cowie, C.R.E., Aldershot and his Staff attended the demonstration and 30 officers from Depots and Units in different parts of the country received instruction.   ThetArmy Canteen Committee has ordered a large number of machines through this Department.II.    TECHNICAL AND ADVISORY.Additional Sub-Committees of the Technical Committee have been formed during the week to deal with (1) Mr. Wibberley&apos;s system of continuous cropping, (2) cost of production of wheat, (3) cost of production of milk, and (4) lime.The typical grass land districts in South Hertfordshire have been inspected and a report drawn up as to the extent to which this part of the county can be expected to contribute to the 1918 Harvest Programme.   Enquiries have been addressed to a number of prominent agriculturists with a view to obtaining the results of their experience in breaking up grass land under different conditions.The Sub-Committee on Feeding Stuffs have given further consideration to the storage of oil-cakes and have taken evidence from representatives of the trade.A large number of enquiries from different parts of the country has been dealt with in the Division, many of the questions
raised having been considered in detail by the various Sub-Committees.     Notes have been communicated to the Press on thefollowing subjects:-   Civilian prisoners as farm labourers;compensation to allotment holders;   use of sewage sludge as afertiliser;   spraying ofi potatoes by small cultivators.III.    LABOUR.Soldier Labour.     During the week soldiers of Category &quot;A&quot; who were on agricultural furlough for the work of Spring cultivation were recalled to their Military duties, and in spite of strong representations to the War Office, no further extension of leave could be obtained.     The number of men, all skilled ploughmen, who were thus recalled in Great Britain, was 17,991, of whom 1,723 had been employed in Scotland.     An extension of leave until July 25th has been granted in the case of the men of the Home Defence Forces still out on agricultural work.The withdrawal of the Category &quot;A&quot; men has led to a large increase in the demand for men of Agricultural Companies, and the Department are in communication with the War Office as to these Companies, with a view to meeting the immediate demands for men and the Increased demands that are likely to be made in the future. Meanwhile some consternation has been caused by the action of the War Office in announcing that the so-called &quot;Agricultural Companies&quot; are in future to be devoted to supplying the needs of the Director of Timber Supplies, and that until his demands are fully met no further men are to be drafted to the Land.     This decision has been come to without the knowledge or consent of the Board of Agriculture and cannot be acquiesced in.The far Office has issued instructions to all Commands that sheep shearers in home units who are not in Category &quot;A&quot; should be given a month&apos;s agricultural furlough if their services are applied for by farmers through the County Agricultural Executive Committees.Prisoners of War. The War Office has Issued regulations providing
for the employment on agricultural work of prisoners within a three mile radius of the &quot;Parent&quot; internment camps.     The Agricultural Executive Committees of the Counties in which such Camps are situated have been informed of the facilities that exist for securing this labour, and have been asked to take steps to inform the occupiers of agricultural land within the prescribed radius.Women&apos;s Branch.Training. The number of training centres is increasing daily, and in some Counties the facilities for training are in excess of the number of g4*i&amp; requiring instruction.     Co-operation between Counties is being arranged so that Counties with a surplus of girlc to be trained are receiving assistance from other Counties where- rthe facilities are not being fully used.Several Counties are starting billeting hostels where women in regular employment with farmers can live, paying their own expenses.     It is hoped that these hostels may assist in securing employment for women, as the want of proper housing accommodation is frequently a serious obstacle.Group-Leaders for part-time workers have been appointed in Surrey and in Anglesey, and applications for Group-Leaders have been received from eight further Counties,National Service.   The number of women volunteering for work on the land whose enrolment cards had been received up to the 14th was 26,738, of whom 24,473 came from England and Wales.     Many of the women are obviously unsuited for farm work and a considerable proportion admit that they only apply with a view to getting a temporary &quot;change of air&quot; in the country.     The Selection and Allocation Committees are, therefore, compelled to reject a very large number.     For example, at Sheffield out of 102 applicants who attended before the Committee only 20 were passed, of whom 2 were subsequently rejected on medical grounds.While in a few Counties the Local Committee or the
Organising Secretary has been successful in placing Individual ^22*Tthe position with regard to the employment of women is not satisfactory.     Some of them have enrolled to undertake farm work at once, others have completed their four weekTs training, but in many cases it has not yet been possible to place them in employment. It is probable, however, that with the continued fine weather and increased work on the land, and as a result of the withdrawal ef soldier labour, the demand by farmers for women workers may be very greatly increased in the course of a few weeks.With a view to encourage the employment of women the Department have arranged for the Organising Secretary of the Women13 $ar Agricultural Executive Committees in each ,County to be co-opted as a member of a special Sub-Committee which is being set up to deal exclusively with the subject of labour.     The Labour Sub-Committees have been urged to give their active assistance to the fomen&apos;s Committees, and to use their influence with farmers to induce them to engage women.     I have pointed out that the present and prospective shortage of man-power in all industries is so serious that dilution of labour Is as essential In agriculture as in any other business, and have suggested that if any farmers unreasonably decline to employ available women the Sub-Committee might refuse to allot to them soldiers or other male labour until they agree to engage a proportion of women.Outfits.   Supplies of outfits are now being received with fair regularity.     2,132 complete outfits have been received in the County store-rooms, and as the number of requisitions sent in by County Committees at present numbers 2,928, it is estimated that in the course of a few days all demands will be satisfied.
MACHINERY SECTION.A further 68 tractors have arrived during the week from America, bringing the total number of Government owned tractors up to 591, of which 91 have been purchased in this country.    50 Tractors which had been placed temporarily at the disposal of the Department have been returned to their owners during the week; 17 Caterpillar tractors have also been returned.     The reports received daily as to the progress of ploughing and the work performed by the tractors are satisfactory.During the week Agricultural Executive Committees have been informed by circular letter of the revised scheme for mechanical cultivation which has been adopted for the 1918 Programme.     Each Committee has been asked to appoint a special Sub-Committee to be known as &quot;The Machinery Sub-Committee&quot;, which will deal directly with the Machinery and Implement Section of the Department in all matters concerning machinery add implements. The Sub-Committees will consist of not more than two members of the Executive Committee, with one Tractor Representative, one Steam Tackle Representative and the Machinery Officer.&apos;   The Machinery Officer, who is to be appointed by the Executive Committee, will be responsible for making contracts with farmers, inspecting the land to be ploughed, and planning the route for each tractor.   The Tractor Representative, who will be a salaried officer of the Food Production Department, will arrange his tractors in units of 10 working tractors and one spare tractor in suitable areas.   He will have the assistance of a supervisor for every one or two units, and will act as the paymaster for his district.    Two base depots are to be established for supplies of spare parts for the whole of England and Wales.   The presence of the Steam Tackle Representative on the Sub-Committee will help, it is hoped, to solve the vexed question of competitive prices which, during the operation of the scheme for Spring cultivation, has caused friction in some cases between the owner of tractors and steam tackle, and will enable steam tackle
to be used to the greatest possible advantage.IV.   SUPPLIES. Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Section. The season for the sale of fertilisers and other requisites being practically at an end, the policy to be pursued next season in regard to distribution is now of primary importance.     A scheme has been prepared with a view to enabling Agricultural Executive Committees to control the provision and distribution of agricultural requisites, and to satisfy themselves that the activities of farmers are not hindered by lack of materials.Sulphate of Ammonia.   The appointment of a Committee to be known as the Sulphate of Ammonia Distribution Committee has been approved, and it is proposed that the Committee should consist of representatives of all the interests concerned, including the agricultural departments, makers and dealers.   The setting up of this Committee is being actively proceeded with, but pending Cabinet approval of the proposals (submitted at the end of April) with regard to the future prices of Sulphate of Ammonia, it is not possible to make arrangements for the disposal of supplies beyond the end of this month.   This delay is causing great dissatisfaction in the trade and the position is rapidly becoming acute.Basic Slag, The question of the prices of $asic Slag has been discussed with the Basic Slag Advisory Committee and the Fertilisers Committee of the Ministry of Munitions, and an agreement has been come to that the prices at which the Slag is sold by manufacturers shall not be raised above the prices prevailing last season by more than 2/6 per ton.     This advance is considered reasonable in view of the increased cost of bags and labour.   The question of regulating the prices at which Slag is sold by dealers presents some difficulty, but it is proposed to fix prices locally by agreement with dealers in the same way as has been done in the case of maize
Superphosphate.     The third cargo of Superphosphates purchased by the Department has arrived and Is being disposed of at once. The arrival of this cargo completes the purchase of Superphosphate made by this Department, and it is,satisfactory to be able toFeeding Stuffs.   From information supplied by the Controller of Oils and Fats with regard to the probable imports of oil seeds during the three months June to August, it appears that the quantities received are likely to be seriously reduced, and it may consequently become necessary to restrict the present use of oil.cakes with a view to conserving supplies against the winter.Seed Corn.   A small Committee, consisting of representatives of this Department and of the National British and Irish Corn Trade Association, has been formed to deal with questions of supplies of seed corn for the 1918 harvest.     The best method of reserving a supply of seed wheat from the 1916 crop, and the provision of sufficient quantities of seed wheat of the more valuable varieties from the 1917 crop are under consideration.Seed Potatoes. The entire surplus stock of potatoes purchased by the Department has been sold during the past week, and delivery of the last consignments will be completed during the next few days. Reports regarding pilfering on a more extensive scale than before have been received from two counties, where serious losses occurred after the potatoes were reconsigned for distribution.   The total quantity of potatoes distributed by the Department up to the evening of the 14th inst., amounted to 15,290 tons, of which more than 8,400 tons have come from Ireland.record the safe arrival of the three shiploads.Seeds Section.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director General.The Rt. Hen Rowland E. Prothero;. M.P. President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
