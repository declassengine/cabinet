The menrs representatives In (a) The Paper Distributing Trades (b) The Tramway-men&apos;s and Omnibus Drivers1 Unions and (c) The Light and Heavy Castings Trades
have definitely decided to join in with the Employers to support the new Substitution Scheme.     To that end, repres-entativos have been appointed as Members of the Trades Com-mittees for the purpose of Substitution,It is particularly gratifying to record that at Watford, where the Trades Council was formerlyopposed to National Service, a friendly feeling has been created a3 the result of a personal visit of Mr, Gilmour.(3)     SUBSTITUTION.The Director of the Substitution Section has during the week been engaged mainly in interviewing applicants for ap-pointments as Sub-Area Substitution Officers, to find men of suitable qualification for such appointmentsj about which special care is being taken.     The total number of Officers appointed to act for the purposes of Substitution is about -150, including 67 Area Officers,  and 65 Officers in Sub-Areas.Demands for the services of Volunteers have scarcely begun to arrive at the local offices from the local employ-ers, but the Substitution Officers already appointed have been busily engaged in dealing with various applications for labour made at the Central Offices, which have been dis-tributed to the Substitution Officers.(4)     AGRICULTURAL SECTION.(a)     Military Labour on Farms.Soldiers in category A. placed on the land by the Military Authorities and due to rejoin their regiments on the 10th instant, have returned to the Army.     By arrangement between the Board of Agriculture, the Military Authorities and the Director-General of National Service, it has been decided that soldiers in lower categories who were to rejoin their regiments on the 25th instant shall remain upon agricul-tural work until the 25th July,     By that date it is hoped
that a suffioient supply of Civilian Labour to carry on their work will be obtained and organised.(b) Part-Time Labour.The Director is engaged in arranging with local organisations to frame schemes for utilising part-time labour on the land.     It is anticipated that valuable as-sistance will thus be given to farmers and others, par-ticularly at the Harvesting of crops and potato lifting.(c) Forestry.The Director has agreed with the Assistant Director of Timber Supplies that the Commissioners of this Section shall work In co-operation with the local representatives of the Director of Timber Supplies with a view to securing and utilising offers for Timber work.The Director has arranged with the representative of the English Forestry Association to place with him such labour as Is at the disposal of this Department for work in Woods where timber is being cut.(d) Control of Labour.Arrangmehts are being made in conjunction with the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for England, with the approval of Lord E^ilner, to vest the supply and control of labour for agri-cultural purposes throughout England in the Agricultural Section of this Department in the same way as has been done in Scotland,     Meetings have been held between representatives of the two Departments and there seems every prospect that com-plete agreement will be reached as to their respective func-tions and the best methods of allocating the various classes of labour available, GENERAL TRADES SECTION.(a)   Trades Committees......  ........&quot;........................ -The Building Trades1 Central Joint Committee are sending out on Monday next their General Appeal to all workpeople and
