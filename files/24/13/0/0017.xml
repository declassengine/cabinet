29th April, 1917. Chief of Imperial General Staff, .War Office, London.Sir,In continuation of the private letter which I addressed bo you yesterday from New York, I give herewith the following information with regard to the action taken by the Military Mission up to date.Intelligence, (a)   The Military Intelligence is represented by&apos; a small section at the War College.   It lacks personnel and funds, but probably these will be granted.(b) Little attention appears to have been paid to obtaining details concerning enemy forces, although the G.S. are in possession of a great deal of general information.   The agents used are of a superior type and well paid, but few in number.(c) Counter-espionage non-existant, but proposals are being made to co-ordinate all efforts under a central body.   The G.S. say they are aware that enemy agents are in the ranks of the Army,(d) Cable Censorship is controlled by the Navy.   Necessity for co-operation with them has been pointed out.(e) Postal Censorship non-existant.   Doubtful if any will be adopted.   The question is being considered by branch of the State Department.(f) Press Censorship.   Great controversy is taking place owing to regulations embodied in espionage Bill, which it is considered would interfere with liberty of the Press,The formation of a voluntary press bureau on similar lines to our own is under consideration.(g) The necessity of forming one organization in order to co-ordinate with the existing branches has been pointed out.Frequent discussions on all branches of Intelligenceare
are taking place, and the many Authorities interested are frankly astonished at the organization required; jealousies exist, but a policy of co-ordination will probably be adopted and I think we can best help this by pointing out how exper-ience has taught us the necessity of one organization, by only coriQuunicating our system to General Staff.     Other-Departments Y/ill have to go to them for information,   With regard to the Civil Departments which have approached me, I have recommended the formation of an Intelligence Organization on a national basis to serve all interests with civilian experts attached.     I think this will overcome the main diffi-culty which is in reality fear of the Naval or Military Authorities becoming too powerful.Artillery. Ordnance,and Army Service Corps.      With reference to the Officers representing the Artillery, Ordnance Corps, and Army Service Corps; no definite progress can yet be reported, as these Officers have only been in Washington one da:/,, which was spent in braking themselves acquainted with the various branches of the American Army.     There appears to be overlapping between the Ordnance Supply and Transport branches of the U.S. War Departments.    It is probable that these will be reorganized.   At present small Committees have been organized at which these Officers will appear and supply any information that may be required.Armament.        The question of Armament depends on:-a.   Production, h*   Military policy. It is established that the U.S. Army can be most quickly armed with our rifle and our guns, and that it will pay them to discontinue using the manufacturing plant now making the Springfield rifle and 3&quot; field gun.We
We point out that it is highly undesirable that fresh calibres should be introduced into the theatres of war, and that the manufacture of French types in this country would involve such delays that it must be regarded as impracticable.   In the end this question will probably   decide the problem of destination of the U.S. forces.There is a good deal of opposition to the discarding of the present armament, chiefly amongst the senior officers of the Army, but it seems probable we will get our way.    I have cabled you (S.C.5.) asking for a cable from C in C British Armies In France to strengthen my hand. Medical Service.     With reference to the Medical Service; Col. Goodwin is in frequent communication with the medical authorities here. There would appear to be some jealousy between the Senior Medical Officer of the Army, Dr. Martin, who is a member of the Defence Committee, and the Secretary of War.   A copy of my telegram of to-dayfs date to the Director General of Medical Services is attached.   I regret that my telegram S.C.2. was despatched.   Dr. Martin assured me that he fully represented the Medical Services. This was subsequently found to be inaccurate. (See my cable to the D, M, S. attached).Air Service.   The following arrangements have been made, (a)       Twelve picked American officers have been   selected for an intensive course at Toronto. These officers will be trained as instructors, but will not fly.(fr)        50 Cadets of the U.S. Army are proceeding immediately to Toronto with the rank of sergeant to be trained with a view to obtaining commissions.(c)       As soon as obtainable, up to 1,000 mechanics of proport-ionate trades will proceed to Toronto for training.   In threeUonths
Months time it is believed that units will be formed from the above personnel provided with transport and tools, but with no machines.   It ic proposed by the U.S. Government that they should go to England as complete units in the U.S. uniform and pay to complete their training.   The U.S. Government are desirous of buying aerodromes near ours.   It will also be necessary for them to purchase machines from us..In addition to the above it is proposed to send to England complete personnel of squadrons with partially trained pilots to be trained and used by us until required by the tjuS*     These would be in U.S. uniform and pay,     (See my telegram S.C 4,).   I consider this highly desirable as a means of starting a good flow of pilots to our armies. The Air Service is very popular- in this country, and the material is plentiful and goodt.As to machines, Mr. Layton has the subject under discussion. It would appear best for the U.S. motor factories to make motors for us,- and to relieve thereby some of our factories at home for the construction of aeroplane engines,Lt. Col, Rees V.C, M.C., has been given a room in a branch of the v:rar Office, and provided with a Car by the U.S. Government.   The C.G.S, has asked for him to be left here as liaison officer with the U.S. Air Service.   I think he would be most iisefully employed in that capacity.Eorestry Companies.   The Secretary for War and the Minister of Agriculture are going into the question of the provision of Forestry Companies for France.   It seems there are 1,500 permanent forest rangers, and 40,000 casual lumber men to draw on, and difficulty in forming companies is not anticipated.   We are to confer about&apos;it tomorrow, and I will then cable.Military Policy.
Military Policy, The questions of military policy have been in abeyance until the Military Bill passed Congress and Senate, This was completed last night with decisive and unexpected majorities.   We have reason to believe that the opportune arrival of the French and British Missions, and our strong views on compulsory service had no small influence on the result.I em In close touch with Marshal Joffre, and we have agreed to press for the following pointsI,      To get a regular division, followed by reinforcementsover to France with the least possible delay,and to completeits training there in a camp handed over to the U.S,2a      To dilute the regular army by withdrawal ,of personnelfor instructors, and filling up from new levy.33        To have a sooond division ready as soon as possible tofollow the fi-rst.4o        Arrangements for ultimate flow of troops as transport available.We agreed to ondoavour to raise the status of the General Staff by giving it all our information, and not to deal with the W.O. or departments, and to point out the undesirability of keeping regular troops to defend the Mexican border.It is evident that the French particularly want the American troops to go to them.   I indicated to Marshal Joffre that it was a matter of indifference to us where they went as long as they came over soon.   We cannot well press for them as we have had so far a complete success with the naval questions, and the French are a little touchy.   I believe finally the armament and linguistic factors will force the Americans to come to us, and also we find, in spite of what we are told, that popular sentiment leads that way.The
The plans for the future have not &quot;been definitely arranged but I have placed the services of the Officers of the Military Mission at the disposal of the G-.S, and W.O. and have informed them that we are prepared to give lectures on various Military topics if desired,1 have made an engagement to visit West Point to inspect the cadets, and to give a lecture on modern warfare, and also to lecture at the War College0I have to-day been invited by the C.GSS0 to forward him in writing ray views as to how the American military forces can beat ao-operate in the war.   This is a distinct step forward consequent on the passing of the Bill, and I will endeavour to ensure that the President sees my Memoe   The Memo.o will embody the views of the War Council as communicated to me by Mr. Balfour..I have the honour to be, - &quot;Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Signed)     Tom Bridges,Lieutenant-General *

Forces coming to our theatres of war should, be entirely either of French or of British types according to destination of those forces.&quot;General Bridges.
