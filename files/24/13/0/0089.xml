From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,15th M.ay 1917.Foreign Secret. Mahsuds. There seems to be inconsistency between your Foreign Department telegrams ending with that of 11th instant, which speak of defensive measures only, and telegram from Commander-in-Chief, India, to Chief of Imperial General Staff, No. 31592 of 13th instant, which speaks of punishment, of tribe and indicates immediate offensive. Estimates of force required, also do not agree. Please telegraph fully what is your policy, and precisely what measures you contemplate. Necessity for eventual punishment of Mahsuds is admitted, but is situation of such a kind as to necessitate immediate offensive, especially in view of your recent correspon-dence with Amir, and of urgent need of man-power elsewhere.
