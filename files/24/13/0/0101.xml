On April 83rd the War Cabinet deoided that &quot;the PresidentIMPORTS FOR CHILIAN PUEPOSIS.of the Board of Trade should furnish the War Cabinet at an early-date with details of the imports (553,000 tons a month) said to be required by the civil population&quot;*With reference to the above direction I beg to state that the figure quoted is not oae for which the Board of Trade are responsible, and in fact we cannot find that it has any real foundation.      Of course the total imports of all kinds required for civilian consumption are very greatly above the figure naiaed^ The Board of Trade understand, however, that the figure supplied to the War Cabinet was intended to represent only such trticles exclusive of food, as are not controlled by the Ministry of Munitions or the War Office, and this being so it appears to the. Board that the figure given is very greatly in excess of actual requirements.From the nature of the case any estimate must to a considerable extent be conjectural, but the following tables give the best approximation which on their present information the Board of Trade are    able to make.    The tables show that the estimated monthly imports of materials and manufactures re-quired for civilian purposes during the six summer months, April to September, 1917, exclusive of food, and of any articles whose import is controlled by the War Office or Ministry of Munitions, may be approximately stated as 260,000 tons: or, allowing a cer-tain margin for underestimate, say, 300,000 tons a month.A.H.S*21st May, 1917.
