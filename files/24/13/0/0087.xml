British Mission,Washington, D.C.SEC R E Ta3rd May 1917.TOcChief of the Imperial General Staff, War Office,London, S.W.Sir,Since last reporting I have had frequent conferences with the Secretary for War and the Chief of the General Staff, and also with Marshal Joffre.   The question of military policy now stands as given in my cable No. S.C.7 of today1s dates As far as can he judged here, this is a satisfactory beginning.There will be friction and difficulties but the . French will be saddled with them.   We are getting substantial naval assistance, and also the promise of trained and untrained pilots and mechanics for the Air Service as required, a number of railway battalions, medical units, and forestry companies,  the idea being to divide the assistance given to the two countries in more or less equal proportions3I have cabled you today about the latest military situation (copy attached).There is at present in the War Department and the General Staff considerable confusion and lack of grasp of the situation..    This is due to the fact that the Chief^of the General Staff is past his work, and nearly all -the heads of Departments in the War Office are over 60 years of age.   It is hoped that this Will be changed before long.   As an example, although the country has now been 4 weeks at war, orders have not yet been issued for uniform to be worn by Officers.I attach a letter written by me to the C.G.So which went on to the President, and helped to bring matters to a
0 9 O e) d 52ohead,The question of instructors being sent from. England or Canada is at present held in abeyance.It is practically certain that we shall not be allowed to recruit American subjects for the British Army.The question of the recruiting of British subjects resident in the United States is proceeding satisfactorily.The question of armaments is being hotly debatedt There being as yet no Munitions Board here the matter lies between civil committees and the War Office,   The General Staff are not strong enough to impress their views on either.   We are endeavouring to help them.   The quickest solution of the problem is for the United States Army to adopt our types and we hope tc be able to convince them of this, but army opinion is very conservative.Frequent lectures have been given to the General Staff and other Officers by myself and members of the Mission as invited to do so by C.G.S. and I think they are beginning to.open their eyes as to what lies before them,I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant, G.T.M.BRIDGESLieutenant General.
Report, of Lt,Col.Langhorne, R,A,On Monday, the 30th April, Col.Langhorne visited the War College, and discussed heavy howitzers. The idea appears to obtain that 6&quot; howitzers should be tractor drawn, five tractors to a battery. No decision has apparently been arrived at with regard to howitzers, except that they have purchased some 8&quot; which have been manufactured in this country, and are of the VIckers pattern.In the afternoon Col.Langhorne visited General Crozier at the War Department, and discussed the uses of railway mountings for guns and howitzers.   General Crozier asked if we could supply 6&quot; howitzers in the event of their deciding to use theiru He was referred to Mr *Layton representing the Minister of Munitions.   Col.Langhorne pointed out the importance of avoiding multiplication jf types of ammunition. Should the United States decide to take up the 6&quot; howitzer-,, two questions of technical Importance will arise.(1) The engraving of range dials in yards instead of degrees;  (2) The graduation of deflective leaves and dial sights/ The Americans follow the French system, which would appear to be the simpler one *Tho question also arose of utilising some of the Coast Defence Mortars, of which there are some 400 of 12&quot; calibre. Notwithstanding structural difficulties, the policy of denuding their coast defence seems to decide against this.On Tuesday the 2nd of May, Col.Langhorne visited the War College, and discussed the establishment of Divisional Ammunition Columns. They wished to know whether they could do without limbered wagons.   Col,Langhorne stated that the percentage of limbered wagons in the establishment of our own D.A.C. was essential.   .-
Col. Langhorne discussed Artillery Maps and instruments used by R.G.A.   He recommended that they should adopt ours and gave them his own as a sample.The question also was raised as to the re-arming their Artillery with light field howitzers.   The French recommend that they should discontinue the manufacture of 3.8 howitzers as being too light and suggests the 6&quot;.    Col. Langhorne considered that this weapon was too heavy for mobile warfare and advised the adoption of the 4.5.On Thursday, the 3rd of May, Col. Langhorne discussed the system of training siege batteries and went through all pamphlets forwarded by the War Office on Artillery and classified them according to date.Lt. Col. F.K.Puckle reports that he has had frequent discussions at the War College and elsewhere but nothing really tangible has transpired.   Committees are being formed by Brigadier General Kuhn, Chief of the War College, who will meet Col. Puckle to discuss the various details for Supply and Transport work.Lt. Col. Rees, V.C.j has been in constant communication with Brig. General Squier.   Col. Rees is at present visiting the Flying School at Toronto, in order t* make arrangements for American pers-onnel to be trained and is proceeding after--wards--to visit an aeroplane factory at Buffalo.There is no doubt that we can obtain every assistance from the American Authorities in obtaining a supply of Flying Officers and mechanics.   The Pilot material is excellent and there is a large field to draw from.
5aLt. Cole Dansey, General Staff, has been in communication with the&apos;War Department and it has been decided to establish an Intelligence Branch modelled on the BritisheLt. Gols Dansey is lecturing at the War College on Military Intelligence.-Lt. Col, Goodwin, R.A.M.C:., reports the following?Six Base hospitals (23 Doctors and 65 Nurses in each, with 146 subordinate personnel) have been mobilized.and it is hoped to dispatch the first unit early next week. 112 additional surgeons and 20 orthopardic surgeons have been called out and given commissions in the Reserve Medical Corps and will be dispatched as soon as transports can be arranged^200 Doctors and 200 Nurses have been promised to be available during each month; June, July and August; total promised by end of August, 870 Doctors and 990 Nurses, The chief difficulty is the provision of transports.Classes of Instructions for the above Offleers and also for young Officers in training at the Army Medical School have been formed and commence work this week.Col. Goodwin is at present at the Surgeon General5s Office at the War Department, daily from 9 am to 6 pm except when giving instructions at the Army Medical School or War College,.   After Dinner young Officers call at his Hotel and obtain InformationcMajor Spender Clay has lectured on Staff Duties,,Cole Heron has lectured and has been asked for information with regard to the Lines of Coimminlcations
SECRET.British Mission,Washington. D.GA , 30th April, 1917.Dear General,You asked me to write you my views as to the co-operation of your military forces in Europe.     They are as follows:-I.       If you ask me how your force could most quickly make itself felt in Europe, I would say by sending 500,000 untrained men at once to our depots in England to be trained there, and drafted into our armies in France.     This is the view alike of our Commander in Chief in Pranoe, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Sir Douglas Haig and Sir W. Robertson!, their reasons being that we are short ef men, the war is at a critical stage, when wo may yet be able to turn ths scale and foroe a decision during the summer, and every day cbunt.s,* Our recruits are put into the field after 9 weeks training in England, and 9- days in Prance, and give a good account of themselves.     With your intelligent men under our system and instructions this would be found ample.     In no ether way could those 500,000 men make their presence felt before what we call the fighting season is over for the year.     Both Sir Douglas Haig and Sir William Robertson however recognise the difficul-ties attending such a course in view of the fact that you are engaged in raising a national army.     However, I put it forward for your consideration whether in view of your enormous man power you cannot do both, in which case the drafts sent to us could eventually, be drafted back into the U.S. Army and would be a good leavening of seasoned men.2.      The sight of the Stars and Stripes on this Continent will make a great impression on both sides.     It will be as good as
A P P BOH     2.SECRET.British Mission, - Washington, D.G.,30th April, 1917.Bear General,You asked me to write you my views as to the co-operation of your military forces in Europe.     They are as follows:-1.      If you ask me how your force could most quickly make itself felt in Europe, I would say by sending 500,000 untrained men at once to our depots in England to be trained there, and drafted into our armies in Prance.     This is the view alike of our Commander in Chief in France, and the Chief of tho Imperial General Staff (Sir Douglas Haig and Sir W. Robertson!, their reasons being that we are short ef men, the war is at a critical stage, when we may yet be able to turn the scale and force a decision during the summer, and every day counts. Our recruits are put into the field after 9 weeks training in England, and 9- days in Prance, and give a good account of themselves.     With your intelligent men under our system and instructions this would be found ample.     In no other way could those 500,000 men make their presence felt before what we call the fighting season is over for the year.     Both Sir Douglas Haig and Sir William Robertson however recognise the dlfficul-ties attending suoh a course in view of the fact that you are engaged in raising a national army.     However, I put it forward for your consideration whether in view of your enormous man power you cannot do both, in which case the drafts sent to us could eventually, be drafted back into the U.S. Army and would be a good leavening of seasoned men,B. The sight of the Stars and Stripes on this Continent will make a great impression on both sides.     It will be as good as
a tactical victory in its moral effect. To this end I would like to see one of your regular divisions sent to France at once, with 50% reinforcements following closely.     They could take over one of our camps, or one of the French, and train under our, or French instructors, and then take their place in a quiet part of the line, their place in the camp being filled by&apos; other U.S. divisions as soon as ready.    If personnel of the regular divisions are required for training new army, withdraw some of them, and fill up with new levies; they will soon get fit for the front once they are in France,You would then have your own training camp in the theatre of operations, and a nucleus on which to concentrate an army if required.At the same time, you would be actively participating in the struggle and suffering casualties, without which it is difficult for a nation to realize the war. 3.     As regards Command, in view of the large Armies now engaged, a few divisions would have to come under Command either of the British or French Commander-in-Chiefs 4,     As regards Armament.(a)   Rifles.   We regard our rifle as a very good campaigner. Though perhaps not a first class match rifle, it is accurate and very durable, and all our rifle grenades and their attachments are made to fit it.   I understand that your Government have decided to adopt the Enfield 1914 pattern rifle, but propose to modify it to take the ,300 cartridge ( i,.e, U.S. calibre). Certain technical advantages are claim-ed for this change-, but the disadvantages seem conclusive. They are: -(1)   The change is estimated by the firm to takefour months.
It will almost certainly take longer, and Involve loss of output *If our calibre is accepted, large deliveries off our contracts could be made at once,(2)   Machine and Lewis guns will have to be chambered to match.(3)   It will be a great disadvantage to have three Instead of two calibres of S.A.A,, in France, especially when the third type Is only used by a small force.   Owing to the risk of confusion, the Russians have always refused to admit a separate calibre for any force less than an army (say 9 divisions) though they have had to make shift with a variety of rifles,(4)   We have enormous stocks of .303 ammunition in France, and can supply all required by any American force in Prance for a long time to come, and so save transport, duplication of manufacture, and the increased competition for copper, and fine spelter, which would be caused by the attempt to build up an S.A.A, output here.On the other hand, .303 rifles&apos; can be modified if desired at any time after the war to take the .300 smaller cartridge.It is believed that the French have sufficient Level rifles to arm a certain number of new divisions, but the UcSc should undoubtedly face the problem of the arming of the whole of its armies with one weapon in the immediate future,.and the question of rapid output will probably decide the question in favour of the Enfield 1914.(b) Divisional Artillery, i,e. Field Artillery and Light Field Howitzers, (in our army the 10 pr, gun and 4.5 howitzer?*It would appear out of the question to take the U.SS 3&quot; gun tz Europe until U.S. troops have prepared ts take over
the battle front of an army.   The difficulty, as with the rifle, is one of ammunition supply.   Divisions are often echeloned one in roar of another, and are sometimes called up to move from one point of the front to another by rail in a few hours, or to take part in a battle of movement.   To malirt-oixr a thin line of supply of a particular kind of --ordnaiLc-e-under service conditions is practically impossible.It, therefore, becomes a question whether the U. S. adopts the British or .French types.It Is believed that the French could arm several divisions with the 75.   But, as in the case of the rifle, whatever field gun is adopted&quot;the further supplies of it should for obvious reasons be made in the U.S. and the time factor will prohibit the laying down of plant for the manu-facture cf the 75.    It would seem to be indicated, therefore that your divisions should be armed with our 18 pr. of which the supply could meet the immediate demand (say 2 divisions) and which is new being made in this country,   No howitzer of less than 4.5 calibre is of use under modem conditions, and it is recommended that this type be also adopted.   We use them in the proportion of sne howitzer tc three guns.The French have no equivalent. Heavy Guns and Howitzers. Here it is a case of getting the best available types regardless of origin.   They are Army Corps and Army weapons, and their supply ef ammunition is comparatively simple.    It would be feasible for U.S. troops armed with British heavy types to fight with the French or vice-versa.Advantage of common types.   The weight of argument is against introducing any new - types into France,, either of guns, rifles or ammunition.The possibility of submarine interruptions make it advisable that the U,S. forces should be able to draw either
upon British or upon French stocks.Even under normal conditions supplies across the Atlantic are much more intermittent than across the channel and in the present emergency may be subject from time to time to quite serious interruptions.Also, from the manufacturing point of view it is a very great advantage for two countries to be making the same article, as it allows of mutual assistance, and exchange of components, drawings, guages, and in other virays.Organization., 7.   I have a strong feeling that you will eventually be driven to adopt something like our organization,, which was evolved for continental v/arfare and which after- nearly three years, is standing the test well.We liked the company of 100 - 150 men for colonial service^, but it fades out of sight under the wastage of the innumerable duties and casualties incident to modern conditions.The battalion of four companies of 250 men each is now universal.The French, as you know, have 6 battalions in a brigade, and two brigades in a division; whilst we have three brigades each of four battalions.We also have a pioneer battalion for each division which we consider essential.As to artillery; we have returned to the 6 gun battery to save on officers, and find they work very well.Our brigades consist of three batteries of 18 prs* and one of 4.5 howitzers.Equipment, 8.   We could find transport wagons, harness etc, for 2 divisions at any time over the other side.,   This would save shipping.9c     It appears to me that the above considerations may have some weight in the decision of your Government as to whether your initial forces are directed to the care of
orour army /to the French.     The French may be able to promise a separate line of supply for a small force.     I understand they are extremely anxious to have your army with them, and they are probably willing to sacrifice a good deal to this end.    I feel certain that Sir D. Haig could not promise this, but would stipulate that your divisions would have to come into line with ours as regards ammunition supply*     If with the French you would probably want your own food supply alsooA few other points occur to me in this connection. You will have the language difficulty to contend with if your divisions go to the French.   The French have very few English speaking officers;   not so many as they thinke     A good instructor can indeed seldom speak English, and men will soon get tired of being instructed through interpreters,.We have been told that the sentiment in this country is in favour of fighting with and for the French.     We under-stand this sentiment, and I am sure our Government would wish nothing better.     At the same time, as I think I have made it clear there are serious military disadvantages, and you will be sacrificing some of your efficiency for this sentiment, and making, in my opinion, the task of your Commanders and staff more difficult in the field0    Once you had a sufficient force in France however it would be quite feasible to place your army between the French and our-selves, where it could, if so desired, be under French direction, and supplied by us.We are all in the same boat, engaged in the same struggle, and from a soldiers point of view should apply our force where and how it will be of most use.10o       We would be glad if you would consider the question -of allowing
7.recruiting of American Citizens for the British, Canadian, and French Armies, from the surplus you will have over your requirements.     We are all going to suffer from a shortage after this summer&apos;s fighting.11, As to training, we would he glad, to show some of your Officers our system of training in England and in France.I would suggest they go over at once,, and also visit the front line4We have large camps in England, and instructors available in case it is thought desirable to get over a good number of untrained men soon in view of submarine activities.The War Office has a number of Officers and N.C.O&apos;s instructors ready to come out and help at your training centres should you have need of them.We hope soon to see your General Staff in a prominent position of direction which it must inevitably assume if the conduct of training and operations is to be effective *I feel I owe you an apology, my dear General, for this long letter, but the subject is a large one, and I have even now only touched on what seem to me the more important points oPlease make any use of this letter that you maythink fitoYours sincerely,(Signed)   T. Bridges.Major General Hugh L* Scott,Chief of the General Staff, U. S . Army.
