From Viceroy, 11th May 1917. (Repeated to High Commissioner, Cairo.)      . ^ (Received at India Office, 10.15 a.m., 18th May.)Secret. Aden. Reference to Aden telegram, 359 A.P., dated 14th May. We are [? not] in a position to gauge prospect of this confederacy succeeding. But as its main object is overthrow of Imam, and ejection of &apos;Turks is onty secondary, we think we should be wise in following traditional policy of non-interference in inter-Arab quarrels. If we support it and confederacy fails we should make permanent enemy of Imam, and bring him definitely down on Turkish side of fence. We think Resident might reply that until confederacy can show that their main objective is against Turks, and that their plans with this end in view are likely to succeed, he cannot recommend Government to support them. There seems little or no fear of Italian-intervention-and we might well leave those conflicting parties to fight it out among themselves and accept the de facto victor afterwards. After all, Imam has been strictly neutral when he might have added to our embarrassments.
