: .... War Cabinet.^;V/&quot;V\\       Prohibition of Horse Raping. a q n7.^1)^1      . MEMORANDUM BY LORD DERBY. ^ 9t^f^ -&quot;-In view of the fact that the Prime Minister is consenting to see a deputation from the Stewards of the Jockey Club, I think it right to give my account of the meeting of the War Cabinet at which it was decided that racing should be entirely prohibited after the first Spring fleeting at Newmarket.The facts as they appear to me are as follows  :-At a.meeting of the War Cabinet, Yhich had been called to discuss the question of the shortage of oats, and at which Lord Devonport was present, but I was not, Lord Devonport was instructed by the War Cabinet to interview the Stewards of the Jockey Club and consider the whole question of racing.This meeting accordingly took place, and a modified and very much smaller amount of racing was arranged for, with a view to the proposal being brought before the War Cabinet.At the War Cabinet held on April 27th (W,C.127(3)), the matter was discussed, but not on the question&apos; of any modified form of racing, but on the general principle as to whether racing should or should not be permitted at all in time cf war. An alternative proposal was never even submitted.     Lord Devonport asked whether they would not consider it, especially asking that the meeting at the end of May, at which the new Derby and Oaks would be run, should be permitted and was proceeding to state his revised proposal as agreed with the Stewards.     This was definitely negatived as Lord Curzon and Mr. Bonar Lav/ v/ere very persistent in the view that no. racing at all should take place, and the War Cabinet having accepted that as a principle,  it was no use discussing the details of any alternative scheme.On that policy the War Cabinet gave a decision, which is recorded in the following words&quot;The War Cabinet took note of the strong feeling which has been shown in the House of Commons against the continuance of horse-racing.     While recognising that the stoppage of horse-racing would not produce any very appreciable reduction in the consumption   of grainstuff for human use, they considered that to permit horse-racing to continue would tend to induce a belief in the public mind that the food situation was less serious than had been represented, and to that extent would stultify Lord Devonport&apos;s efforts to secure economy in its use.In view of the serious food situation prevailing in the country, as shown in the reports of the Food Controller and of the Committee above referred tc, the War Cabinet requestedLord Devonport to cummunicate to the Jockey Club their deoision that after next week horse-racing shall cease throughout the United Kingdom until further notice.Lord Devonport was also authorised to conclude arrangements with the Jockey Club for the rationing of thoroughbred animals&quot;.There
There was a meeting of the Jockey Club on Monday, and, feeling that it was impossible for me to remain silent at such a meeting, I drew up a statement which I asked Mr. Bonar Lav/ to give me authority to read,     Mr. Bonar Law amended the statement and particularly asked that I should emphasise the fact that the War Cabinet were in complete unanimity on the principle that no racing should be allowed during war-time. This statement as amended was read by me at the meeting of the Jockey Club.At the Cabinet it was definitely stated that the ban on racing in England was to be extended to Ireland, and Mr. Bonar Law admitted that in the House of Commons.      It would appear, however, that the Chief Secretary for Ireland feels that it is quite impossible to stop racing in Ireland, and licences are being given for future racing there.I stated to the War Cabinet that I considered raging on a limited scale was not only possible but was absolutely necessary if the horse breeding industry Was to be maintained, and I must protest most strongly if it be now represented that I acquiesced in the decision arrived at,  or that any alternative scheme was allowed to be presented.     The question was settled on the principle as above stated, that no racing should be allowed in war time and refusal was given to the suggestion that a limited -amount of racing should be allowed.I still adhere to the belief that this suggestion should be acted on, and trust that the Prime Minister will be able to grant this concession to the deputation from the Jockey Club, but Lord Devonport and I must reserve to ourselves the right of stating publicly what our attitude has been throughout, as otherv/ise it would appear as if we had been guilty of a gross breach of faith to the Jockey Club.I have shown the    statement to Lord Devonport who authorises me to say he entirely concurs in my version of the proceedings.D.15th May, 1917.
