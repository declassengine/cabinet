S E 0 B E g G&quot;.T.&apos; 720WAR CABINET IRELAND - HORSE-BREEDING AID SAP DIG. (Memorandum by the Ghief Secretary for Ireland)A decision as to whether the Government will take any action as to horse-breeding and racing in   Ireland has become urgently necessary.So far as I am aware no step has yet been taken by the War Cabinet which affects the legality of either of these things.     I have not indeed received notice of any action of tho Cabinet except a direction to Lord Devonport to make certain communications to the Jockey Club, who do not at any time exercise authority over racing in Ireland.The holding of race meetings and the feeding of cereal food to race horses can no dcubt be rendered illegal by properly framed Defence Regulations.     I have grave doubt whether such Regulations can bo made effective in Ireland. An indiscriminate prohibition of racing will certainly bo followed by some (and perhaps a large number of) illicit race meetings.     I have information to the effect that provisional steps have been taken already to organise such meetings.     To prevent them by any precautionary action is almost impossible:    to suppress them will involve the employment of force for a purpose which is not merely unpopular but seems to bo regarded generally in Ireland as needless and vexatious3     A regulation of the Pood Controller to cut off the supplies of oats to racing stables and breeding studs can probably be made effective.     It will Cause trouble and provoke resentment and will not save much food by its compulsory application.     The food at present consumed by thoroughbred and other superfluous horses can be better economised by securing co-operation among breeders and trainers.In view of the unavoidable delay of action in regard to this matter I have been for the past ten or twelve days besieged with inquiries as to what, is to be done.     The SteY/ards of the Irish Turf Club probably have power still to secure the economies in relation to horse-food which the Government wants.     The Clubs authority rests however on the voluntary acquiescence in its directions of owners and trainers of horses and if it can do nothing for them it will lose all prestige of authority.     Prompt steps to strengthen tho hands of the Stewards are necessary^Por this week there was a considerable programme of racing in the four provinces of Ireland-    Without any breach of any existing lav/ or regulation it could I think have been carried out in its entirety.     I secured the abandonment of two-thirds of the meetings by saying the Government would permit two,     I really had not so far as I knew any more authority to sanction than I had to prohibit, but I informed the Stewards&apos; that as a matter of emergency they might sanction the two meetings.
Reading from the Newspapers in which it.is stated that all thoroughbreds are to bo rationed, with few exceptions, after May 21st,  it looks very like as if the Government will allow no racing.I understand it is suggested in England that a limited amount of racing for two and three year old horses might be granted, and no doubt this would appease the people in England, but the conditions in Ireland arc so totally different, that if any racing is allowed in Ireland, it would be better to allov.r a few meetings to take place at which horses,  at the discretion of the Stewards, could run; let the number of horses be cut down as small as you like.You could put Ireland on the same lines as England by p.llow-ing so many days racing to each, but the conditions of the two countries as regards what horses may run on a different footing, and it will be necessary in this country to divide up the meet-ings to different districts, where two or three year old horses would not run.I fear that illegal meetings (races  4. 10. 0) will spring up all over the country if legitimate raoing is abolished,  and they will bo very difficult to prevent.   Racing now in Ireland is 3topped, but on Sunday an illegal meeting is to take place in Dublin,I see vory grave difficulties in front if any attempt is made to supervise the rationing of horses.   You. will require an army of police to carry it out.   It will be far easier to limit the amount of horses in training and let the others &apos; be turned out, the trainers will carry out the wishes of the Stewards and support them loyally which will avoid the difficulty of enforcing ration-ing of horses,I am sorry to say that I have heard conversations in trains where I have not been known, between men who should have known much better,-   &quot;We are not going to have racing stopped anywhere in Ireland to please the British Government, if they do, we will start  4, 10. 0 meetings throughout the country,   I should like to see the police coming to look at the way my horses aro rationed&quot;.The extremists won at Longford and racing wa3 one of their cries.   *;f it is no&apos;- abolished, they will be stronger than ever.(Intlld)   D.Tho maintenance of a fair show of public order in Ireland is a &quot;business in which, difficulties constantly arise from unavoidable internal causes.   If difficulty is to be avoided in respect to the matter now under consideration which affects business interests and popular feeling in every town and village in the country, a course of action needs to be resolved upon which will be generally accepted as being necessary and reasona-blcI append a memorandum which I have received from Lord Docie3, Pre33 Censor in Ireland, who is a steward of the Turf Club, and a very level-headed and helpful man.(Intlld).    H. E. D.14th May,  1917.
