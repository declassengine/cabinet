uSECRET GTTTf64THS AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS FOR 1918It will be within the recollection of the Cabinet that I was asked, on May 8th to inquire into the possibility of obtaining the additional labour and fertilisers required to carry out the programme of increased agricultural production for 1918 in all parts of the United Kingdom.     I had a meeting on this subject at 2sWhitehall Gardens on Kay 9th, at which Sir: Arthur Lea and Mr..Strutt as representing the Board of Agriculture, Generals Macready and Shaw as representing the. War Office,&quot;representatives of the Scotch and Irish agricultural departments, also Mr Jlunro, Secretary for Scotland, and Mr Seville Chamberlain and Mr, Harding Turner wsre present.-&quot; feRTXIISSRS-As regards fertilisers - by far the easier of the two questions - .wo came to the conclusion, that all necessary materials were obtainable in this country except ^o^ohate rock, but that   it was absolutely necessary to import&quot; phosphate rook ab the rate of oOTo Off &quot;tons a&quot;monta &quot;if trie mannfae cure     &quot; of super phosphate in qiiaircioies sufficient to render possible the execution of the agricultural&apos; programme, v/as to be kept&apos; up.     The 59,000 tons was the minimum necessary, taking into account the requirements of Ireland as well as of Great Britain,I accordingly wrote&apos;to the Shipping Controller to Inquire whether the Importation of this amount of phosphate Book could be secured.     His answer is that this can only be done by sacrificing an equivalent quantity ox iron ore.     The phosphate rock and the iron ore are practically alternative imports. The same .ships, trading in the same seas, bring both, and an increase of one means a diminution of the other,     It is&quot;in-different to the Shipping Controller which he brings.This is a question which   can   only be settled by the Cabinet.     Personally I have no doubt whatever what our decision should be.     The amount of iron ore asked for by the Ministry of Munitions is 550,000 tons a month.-     As a matter of fact&apos; they have never during recent months obtained more than 450,000, but this is probably the practical limita     If the import cf phosphate rook is to be increased from 30,000 tons - the present limit - to 50,000, it means taking 20,000 tons of the iron ore. Important as the importation of iron ore is, I cannot believe that the loss of SO,000 tons a month - representing about bfo of the importation and on3.y ZPJo to 3^ of the total supply - is going to make a vital difference to munitions.     On the other hand, the difference between 30,000 tons per month of phosphate rock and 50,000 is practically&apos; the whole difference between the supply necessary.for our present rate of agricultural production and that required for the proposed increased rate. To withhold it is about equivalent to killing the whole agricultural programme.,  &apos; Moreover, the phosphate rdek cannot be, In human possibility, replaced by anything else, whereas the diminished importation cf iron ore can, and I believe ought to be made&quot;good by the increase of home production.     from my point of vie?/, there is even a certain a&amp;vamtsge in a . difficulty which may compel us to push the home production of iron ore with greater energy.
I an, therefore, altogether in favour of instructing the   Shipping Controller that tho necessary minimum of phosphate^, rook for our extended agricultural programme - i,e. 50,000 tons a month - should have priority.IiABOUEAs regards labour, the position is a very serious one, and without the intervention of the Cabinet, giving definite and stringent orders on the subject, I do not think the needs of.agriculture nan be rnet*     The immediate position is as followsBetween 40,000 and 50,000 men have been temporarily lent to the Food Production Department by the Armyo     They have been of immense use - indeed, without them, the very large addition to the area under tillage, both in England and Scotland, which has actually taken place already, would have been impossible.. It transpired, however, at the meeting above referred to, that tho Food Production Department was under a promise to the Army to return the Schedule A mon - 16,000 in number - on the&apos; 10th May and tho bulk of men of the lower categories on tho 25th May. Only what are knownas tho Agri*cultural Companies -&quot;consisting &apos; in all of 11,000 men -&quot;were to be loft for a longer, and indeed, as far as I understand, for an indefinite period.Sir Arthur Loo and .Mr,Strutt represented&apos;that tho loss to agriculture of all the men lent by the Army, with the exception of tho Agricultural Companies, in tho immediate future, would have a.most&apos;disastrous effect.     So far from being able to spare any men,&apos;thoy wanted, if not quito immediately yet at a very early date, at least 80,000 extra additional able-bodied men and 25,000 women   whole-timers.Under considerable pressure the representatives of the War Office agreed that, if tho 18,000 A men were returned.to tho Army at once, tho.period during which all the men.of the lower categories were&quot;to be loft to Food Production, should be extended for 2 months, i,o, from May 25th to July 25.     After that date, &quot;hewj-er,only the Agricultural Companies were to remain.     This&apos;&apos; 6oncession, though it by no moans solves the main difficulty,, is nevertheless very important, as it gives us a little more time to tackle tho enormous problem of the additional labour which agriculture requires.The great question remains, however, how wo are to get the 80,000 additional at lo-Hodiod mon, plus the 20,000 or thereabouts who will bo withdrawn by tho Army at the ond of July, when only the Agriculture Companies - at present some 11,000 in number - will be left tc help the farmers.     It is absolutely necessary that the Cabinet should realise how very sorious and urgent this question is.     We may tide over for a month or two, but, as I&quot;have already said, as matters now stand, by tho end of July, all tho military labour except the Agriculture Companies will be withdrawn, and even the Agriculturo Companies - a small item in any case - have now boon   cut into by an arrangement made between Lord Derby and Sir Bampfylde Fuller:   that all mon in those   Companies not actually engaged in agriculture at the moment, should be transferred to timber cutting, and that timber should have the first call upon this reserve of labour in future.I do not criticise this ai*rangement, because I realise the great urgency of the timber problem.     Moreover, even if it had not been made, the agricultural situation v/ould only have been very slightly relieved.    We are up against a much
(Initial!od) M.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 20th May, 1917bigger problem than three or.four thousand men more or less oan greatly influence.    Putting it broadly, we have got to find at least another 100,000 mon in the courso of this summer, if tho agricultural programme for 1917 or 1918., or anything liko it, is to bo: carried out,   . For son ally I do not think the problem, ,though-very difficult, is by any means insoluble; But every possible solution involves considerable disturbance, and will moot with vigorous resistance from somebody.     It is no use tc begin fighting and upsetting people right and left, unless we have quite made up our minds that the carrying out of the agricultural programme is a matter of  vital and primary importance.-    Personally I think it is..    But I am not quite sure whether that conviction is shared by my colleagues. Until I am sure, I think I should be doing harm rather than&quot;good by pressing for strong measures to get the necessary labour, which cannot be done without seriously disturbing a groat many people.-In any case, it is no use upsetting the whole country to&quot; got tho lab6ur until we have got tho Corn Production Bill;    or, at any rate, unless it is quito cloar that wo mean to got it without serious amendment.     If the farmers are tc be induced to go In for largely increased production, two things arc necessary. One is- labour,     The other is insurance against loss, such as the Corn Production Bill provides.     It is no use getting the one without the other.    As long as the? feel doubtful whether ^hey will be loft at the mercy of accident as regards price, tho majority of them will not move, even if tho labour&quot;is forth-coming.     On the other hand, if the Bill was once safe, I believe the provision of the -labour would bo easier than it is to-day, because everybody would then know that the Government really meant business in the matter, about which there is still, in many&apos; quarters, very considerable doubt.
