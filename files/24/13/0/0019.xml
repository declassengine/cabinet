May 4 - 10, 1917.The Union of South Africa have accepted the new regulations in regard to certificates of origin and interest for goods destined for South Africa.As from May 7 export licences will be required for all goods brought into the United Kingdom for trans-shipment to further destinations.The Contraband Committee have, during the past week, placed in the Prize Court a consignment of wine ex s.s. &quot;Setubal&quot; bound for Denmark from Oporto; also two packages of rubber ex s,s. &quot;Stockholm&quot; bound for Sweden from lew York.The United Shipping Company have for the moment suspended the sailings of their produce boats to the United Kingdom.     This action is the result of the capture by the Germans of the produce boats &quot;Storebelt&quot; and &quot;Clara&quot;, The Danish Government have protestedagainst these seizures at Berlin;    the result of the protest is not yet known.       H.M. Government have inti-mated that they expect sailings to be resumed.     The United Shipping Co. propose to send their boats to Norway through territorial waters, if no guarantees -for the future can be obtained from Berlin.The embargo upon imports of rice and rice-flour into Denmark has been removed,  and a ration of 9,236 tons per annum has been fixed.     Shipments of fertili-sers are to be heft up for the moment.       Imports of raw cotton, cotton yarn and waste are to be controlled
by the Danish Associations as from January 1 last.   The Associations have accepted rations for syrup and glucose, wines and spirits.The Danish Tonnage Committee have drawn up statis-ties to prove that Denmark cannot import the supplies which are essential to her unless either the thirty-two Danish ships which ELM. Government have requisitioned are restored or the use of Norwegian or other foreign shipping is permitted.       The Danish Government have &quot;been invited to send a delegate to London with powers to negotiate upon this question.A satisfactory agreement was concluded on May 4, between H.M. Government and the Swedish Government, respecting the exit of British and Allied vessels from the Baltic up to a total of 90,000 nett registered tons. The ships may load with sawn timber:    the Swedish Govern-ment will furnish them with provisions, bunkers and lubricants for the voyage to Norway, and will protect them while they are in Swedish territorial waters.Food riots occurred in Norrkoping on May 4 and in Stockholm and Gothenburg on May 5.     The Swedish Minister of Agriculture had some days previously informed a public meeting at Stockholm that it was impossible to stop the export of pork and meat to Germany.Embargoes have been placed on the importation into Sweden of tar of all kinds, oleine, fatty acids and soap.Agreements regarding the importation of fodder have been concluded with the National Association of Grain &amp; Flour Importers and with the Millers&apos; Association.
Embargoes have been placed on the importation into Norway of glue and casein, mahogany and English ashwood.A company called the Scandinavian Investment Company has been registered in Christiania.     It will invest in London Stock Exchange Securities or in special loans of the British Government.     Of the seven directors four are Norwegian, one Swedish, one Danish and one British.       The share-capital is 2 million kroner and the debenture-capital 20 million kroner;   but it is hoped that the capital may be eventually increased to 100 Million, kroner.Our purchases of Norwegian Eat and Spring Herrings, under our second purchase scheme, amounted on April 28 to ,1,785,000 export-packed barrels of 110 kilos.     We have also bought 3,000 tons of wet-salted fish, 7,000 barrels of medicinal cod oil and 5,000 barrels of fish-roe.Large quantities of native hides and skins have accumulated in Norway as a result of the prohibition of export.      The Norwegian Government are being asked whether these stocks could be exported to the United King-dom and, if so, at what price.According to the Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association the ships which they could place immediately at our dis-posal amount to 337,500 tons gross.     The amount of British shipping which we should be expected to place in the Anglo-Norwegian trade would be 300,000 tons.     The counter-proposal of H.M, Government is that we should be allowed to secure about 748,000 tons gross of Norwegian shipping.
HSTHEBM^S.        The embargo ^on tanning materials has been removed.The Trawler Owners&apos; Association have decided to lay up their Trawling Fleet until Germany guarantees that their vessels will not be torpedoed.The Netherlands Overseas Trust offer to accept a ration of 135,000 artificial teeth as from April 1, 1917.       The War Trade Statistical Department recommend that the offer be accepted.       The present embargo on teeth studded with platinum is difficult to administer. It is thought that an agreed ration will be more satis-factory.     The control of the ration will be left to the Trust, the usual method of importation being by parcel post.SWITZERLAND. The new trade agreement between Switzerland andGermany guarantees to the Swiss a supply of potatoes (1,500 waggons);    of coal and iron as under the old agreement;     of chemical manures and sulphate of oopper.     Switzerland, by way of compensation, will export to Germany agricultural produce and cattle; an unofficial report adds that Swiss exports of aluminium and calcium carbide to Germany will be increased.H.M. Government have instructed the British delegates in Paris to observe a benevolent attitude towards the Swiss demand for the increase of certain rations.Arrangements have been made for the transit of Malt, Sugar and Cocoa to Switzerland via Germany.SPAINThe Cortina Agreement is not yet confirmed; but ^the Spanish Government have withdrawn the regulation
requiring that British ore-ships shall carry 33$ of a full cargo of coal on the outward voyage to Spain.A prohibition of the export of pig-iron, steel and iron will shortly be issued.jiTITED STATES. Mr. Balfour is satisfied with the resultsobtained by the conferences of the Allied Mission with the United States Government.     The Administration and a large party in Congress are persuaded that it is advisable to introduce a licejcing system, and to use it as a lever for obtaining the services of neutral tonnage and for reducing neutral exports to Germany.     Measures against Trading with the Enemy are in contemplation.It has been decided by H.M. Government to supply Washington with full weekly figures of the losses of Allied shipping, in order to prove the necessity of mobilising the American merchant-marine for war purposes.The Statutory Black List for the United States and the Philippines has been withdrawn.-   JAPAN. The Statutory Black List for Japan has beenwithdrawn.0. GERMAN SUBMARINE BLOCKADE.
