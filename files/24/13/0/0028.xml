The questions raised since the entry of America into the War as to the necessity of the provision of a Hitro-Cellolose Factory at Eenbury on the &quot;Bristol Channel involve considerations upon which, I think, I should seek the decision of the War Cabinet.The attached Minute from Sir Keith Price sets out the case very clearly.     There is, ho?/ever, one important consideration which was not before him and which is very material to the issue.   We have now received from the War Office a demand for guns during 1918, the magnitude of which will be seen when I place in parallel columns - the number of Guns now available, and the number asked to be provided before the end of 1918 to make good wastages and to provide additional batteries.( Ho.of guns now (Total oatput of new gunsnow available) required up to end of 1918)13 pr A.A.-229 1823.in.

But we must look forward, and I am making arrangements for greatly increased gun production.    It is evident also that, with an augmented number ,of guns,/there
there will have to be a further addition to the Shelland Ammunition Programme, though happily the provisionof ammunition is good for the guns at present in theField.   We may therefore look during next year to alargely increased demand for Mtro-Cellulose Powder andwe may find ourselves confronted with an increased demand .for it at the expense of cordite, if, as anticipationssuggest, it is found to cause materially less corrosion ofthe guns.   I am advised that it would be possible toforego the construction of the acid plant for the presentand to derive the acid from the neighbouring faotory atAvonmouth.   Short of this, however   whilst fullyrecognising the demands whioh i.t makes upon labour andmaterials, my own view is that we should proceed withthe erection of the Factory up to a 500 ton capacity per week.Another very important consideration which arises is that sometime ago it was arrangedtthrough the Italian Government, that we should send officers to that country in order to recruit Italian labour, particularly for building and for quarrying.   These arrangements have now been completed. Steps have also been taken,, with the consent of the French Government, to enlist Italian labourers who are now in France and it is expected that some thousands will be enrol3ed and the necessary arrangements have been mado for their trans-shipment, etc.   It was proposed to use Italian labour on bloc at Henbury and to move the British workmen there to other jobs.   It may be possible to use these Italians for other purposes, but it must be remembered that they have been specially recruited for this kind of work and it would make our position very difficult in future in seeking labour assistance if we wore now to say that we did not want thorn.(Signed)     0. ADDISON.May 14th 1917.
COPY.THE MINISTERThis factory was authorised when the full Gun Ammunition Programme was in forced was designed to menu-faoture 1,000 tons of Nitro-Cellulose Pjwder a week and was estimated io cost between  6,000,000 and  7,500,000.     Early in April, In view of the substantial reduction in the programme, it was decided to proceed with the factory on a basis of producing 500 tons of Powder per week, all arrange-ments being made, however^ so that the original scheme could be carried out without delay, If required.     Since this dato, the programme has been further reduced and the United States has Joined the Allies.     The reduction in tho programme ropresents 1,100 tons of Powder a week, dr more than the capacity,of the factory, in addition to whioh very substantial reserves will, have accumulated, owing to tho large purchases made in America in anticipation of the maximum&apos; programme.,:;These contracts with America will expire at the end of October.The question at issue how is whether the factory should be proceeded with or not;   the arguments pro and con are roughly as follower-1.,   The construction of the factory -will employ about 15,000 men who would be used for other essential work,    When producing,. tho factory will require .about&apos; 8,000 hands, but of these 75$ will be women. ;   &apos; -2.     The abandonment of the work would create a very bad impression locally and probably politically;   and it wotild certainly represent a capital loss of at least  750,000, perhaps oonDiderably -more.     In this connoction it should be noted/
2.noted that it Is probable that tho laige new Picric Acid Factory at Avonniouth, which adjoins Henbury, will not actually be worked, but will be kept as a necessary stand-by.    Its output will apparently not be required at present, in view of the reduotion in the H*E. Programme.     It is, therefore, difficult to see how it is possible to avoid very serious criticism if work at Henbury also is stopped now.3. It is possible the existing Ammunitioa Programme may be increased.4. If tho faotory is completed, and it is found its output is not required, a considerable portion of the expenditure will have boon wasted.     But against this must be set.that the Power Station, any Sulphuric Acid Plant erected, Water Supply and general development of the dietriot will represent good assets as follows:r(a). Power Station, etc - Estimated Cost about  750,000.     The Bristol Corporation are already under agreement with the Department as to this, and are prepared to take it over after the war.(b). Water Supply - Estimated Cost about  600,000. ,Water is&quot;scarce in the district, and with new industries starting up, it is believed this expenditure can ultimately be recouped.-    The&quot;Bristol Corporation would probably be prepared to teke this over also., (c). The site is an excellent one, and should be very valuable when developed.     There will bo excellent railway facilities, water power, and deep water docks within a few miles.&apos;  - Coal is oheap and labour is fairly abundant.5.   The U.ScA0 being no?; an Ally and Exchange difficultiesbeing/
being easier, it oan be argued that we had better purchase Powder there rather than use labour, material and plant to erect a factory which will scarcely be producing this year.     On &quot;the other hand, it is possible that the United States, being now a belligerent, may have no Powder to spare when it is wanted, although if roally required they oould erect factories, probably quicker than is possible here.6*   Ihere is no Mtrt)-K?el!Lalose Factory at present in the Kingdom (Messrs. Nobel*s are erecting a small one-150 tons weekly - at Irvine), and in view of the opinion held in many quarters as to the advantage of this Powder, especially from the point of its small corrosion of guns, it would appear that a Government Factory on a large scale would bo a very useful asset to the country.7. There will be difficulty in obtaining sufficient alcohol to run the factory unless we trench on our whiskey resources;   this would be very expensive.8.   The main argument in favour of abandoning the construction of the factory altogether is the saving of tonnage involved by purchasing in U.S.A. instead of importing raw materials and working them up here.     One ton of Hitro-cellulose Powder represents four tons of raw material.     Tho raw materials usod are mainly cotton, sulphur or pyrites and nitrate of soda.     Of these materials cotton is of course produced in U.S.A.     Although, at the present time ioerica imports a certain quantity of pyrites, there is sulphur available, if necessary, in tho country/
mm 4-country, and any new Sulphuric Acid plants required could be adapted to burn this material..Nitrate of soda from Chili has to be imported into either country, but the passage to U.S.A. ports whether on the East or West Coast is shorter and, of course, much safer than the passage to this country.     Thus the saving in tonnage by purchasing NItro-cellulose in U.S,A. on a 500 ton per week basis would probably be between 800 and 1200 tons per week,9,   Tonnage difficulties may possibly cause a shortage of glycerine, which might affect the production of cordite..     One ton of glycerine represents 30 tons of imported materials, and a ton of cordite contains between 133 and .184 tons of glycerine.     A shortage of cordite would mean an increased demand for Hitro-cellulose Powder,Original estimate say......27,000,000.Deduct for reduction in capacity to 500 tons with Power and Water for 1000 tons,and elimination of GrilloSulphuric Acid Units................ 1,500 ,000.. 5,500 ,000.(SGD). E. W. PRICE.D.E..S. 8.5ol7aOwing to the reduction of the Avonmouth Factory for Picric Acid, there will be sufficient surplus acid produced there to run-.Henbury-on the 500 tons basis,    It is not proposed therefore to erect any acid units at Henbury for the present.
