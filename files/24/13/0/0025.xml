From Sir P. Cox, Bagdad, lSlli May i 917.. (Addressed Foreign, repeated-to Secretary of Stale for India.) (Received at India Office 14th May, 11 a.m.)1612. Supply of officers for Mesopotamia. (1) Secretary of State&apos;s telegram dated 21st April. In any case 1 think that Colonel Knox would have done well for purpose now required, but as His Majesty&apos;s Government seem to regard him as too much immersed in Indian codes to be a safe exponent of their judicial policy in the Bagdad Vilayet, and as I have undertaken to promote that policy, it is difficult for me to press further for his translation to Bagdad. To him, however, the decision means that he is deprived of all prospect of advancement in this country, and I trust that disappointment will be made up to.him. I accept Major Bonham-Carter, if His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied as to his suitability, and request that he may join as soon as possible. Referring to High Commissioner^ telegram 443 of 16th April. Present Revenue arrangements are that Revenue Departments of Bagdad and Basra Vilayets are in charge of two 37oung Indian civilians, Messrs Carbett and Gordon-Walker, respectively, who, together form a Revenue Board, assisted by Mr. Billiard, Levant Consular Service. The revenue work at out stations is done by the local assistant political officers under supervision of the Revenue Board. Special junior officers for revenue are therefore not now needed, but what 1 do need is an efficient successor to Mr. Dobbs as head of revenue administration, and I know of no one specially suited to the post. It is essential that he should be physically active, able to tour freely and ready to associate with Arab agricultural element, and be generally accessible. Mr. Dobbs knows what is wanted, and I recommend that he be asked to suggest a suitable man. He should be of no less seniority than Dobbs, and would have general supervision over revenue administration of both Vilayets.Referring to Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 9th May. Harris is dead. Worrall cannot be spared from Bushire unless he can be replaced by another officer. The other two officers do not apparently know Arabic, and will therefore be of no use for the present. They might be directed to study Arabic. Meanwhile, should be glad of four or six young Arabic-speaking officers from Egypt or Soudan.
