-COHTOIBTIAL G.T. 741IMPERIAL   WAR   CABINET..The Question of Communicating Documents to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of, Australia.(Note by the Secretary).Instructions are requested from the War Cabinet as to what Imperial War Cabinet documents, if any,  should be transmitted to the prime Minister of the Commonwealth of&apos; Australia,No resolution was passed by the Imperial War Cabinet itself on this question, and there is, therefore, no absolute obligation in the matter.It must be remembered, however, that the Prime Ministers cf each of the self-governing Dominions represented at the Imperial War Cabinet have taken away.with them the whole of the documents prepared in connection with the meetings. These&apos;Prime Ministers, therefore, will be at a considerable advantage compared with Mr. Hughes if he is not also sent a complete, oet of the papers.I discussed the whole question with the Secretary of State for the Colonies this morning., and he rather inclined to the view that on the whole it would be best, to snnd Mr. Hughes a complete set of the papers, although he pointed out that, in order to ensure their safety, it would be necessary - to send a Special Messenger with leaded boxes,  etc., such as were supplied to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions and Y/ith special instructions as to how to act in the event of his ship being apprehended by the enemy.,(Signed)   H.P.A. HAKKEY,2 Whi t eh all Gar d ens, -   .      S.W.May.17th, 1917
