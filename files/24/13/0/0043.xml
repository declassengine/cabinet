THE IRISH QUESTIOH.(Copy of a letter from Mr. Redmond... -to-&quot;the Prime Minister, dated 17th May 1917).Dear Mr, Lloyd George,The grounds on which tho Irish Party decided not to negotiate with the Government are well known to you, and I do not thinx it would serve any useful purpose to restate them on this occasion.I note what you&apos;say as to tho impossibility of taking notion which &quot;would revive violent political controversy&quot; in &quot;the crisis of the war&quot; and the consequent -necessity imposed- upon the Gcvern-rnent of confining themselves to proposing a settlement &quot;which Would be substantially accepted by both sides&quot;-.I cannot accept this proposition, and must observe that it has not been applied, in some ether matters since the outbreak of the war.I have laid your letter before my colleagues and they have carefully considered the two alternative proposals contained in it.The first oro ao sa 1 would, in their opinion, find no support in, Ireland,&apos; and they desire me to inform you that they are irrecon-ciiiably opposed to this scheme., and that any measure based on it will meet with their vigorous opposition.The reasons for this decision can better, if necessary, be stated in the Debate on Monday.The second alternative, i^e, , the &quot;assembling of n Convention of Irishmen of all parties for the purpose of producing a scheme of Irish Self-Government&quot;, has much tc recommend it. You ask &quot;Would it be too much to hope that Irishmen of all creeds and parties might meet together.in a Convention for the purpose of drafting a Ccn-stitution for their country which should secure a just balance of all the opposing Interests, and finally compose the unhappy discords which have so long distracted Ireland and impeded its harmonious development?&quot;.This is a great ideal, and I trust it may be found possible of realisation. My colleagues and I, at all events, will-place no obstacle in the way, and we are prepared to recommend this proposal most earnestly to our Countrymen, on condition that the basis on which the Convention is tc be called&apos;is such as to secure that it will be fully and fairly representative of Irishmen of all creeds, interests, and parties; and, secondly, that the Convention be summoned without delay.If this proposal is put into operation, I can assure you that no effort on the part of my colleagues and myself will be spared to realise the hibh and blessed ideal pointed to in the concluding paragraph of your letter,Yours very truly,(3d) J. E. REDMOND.R B,T. 743,WAR     0 A 3 I N E T.
