MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, May 9, 1917.PART I-ACTION  TAKEN.Control of Prices and Supplies.Cereals. By tlie Oat and Maize Products (Retail Prices) Order, 1917, which, was issued on May 9 and comes into force on May 21, a maximum retail price of id per lb. is fixed for maize flour, maize meal, and other like products, and a maximum price of 5^d. per lb. for oatmeal, rolled oats, and flaked oats. The Order applies to pro-prietary brands except in such cases as the Food Controller may otherwise determine. A breach of the terms of the Order will be a summary offence against the Defence of the Realm Regulations.In view of the considerable rise of prices in Winnipeg during the first few days of May, the Wheat Commission found that there might not be sufficient tenderable -wheat to fill their purchases of May options and cabled to the Vice-Chairman on the 3rd, saying that every effort should be made to avoid an undesirable rise in prices which would appear to be similar to the effects of a corner. They suggested that our agents should co-operate with the local Chamber of Commerce to prevent dislocation of trade or further increase in prices, and should come to terms with the sellers of the options as to taking other quantities or delaying delivery; the suggestion was acted on, and the President of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange cabled expressing thanks for the generous and equitable arrangement made by the Commission through their agents.In order to facilitate the shipping arrangements from North America the Commission have suggested that all arrangements for shipping grain and munitions from North America should be placed in the hands of the Admiralty Representative in New York.   .The Commission have cabled to the Australian Government informing them that they could not undertake to lift so much as 30,000 tons of flour every month, and offering suggestions for storage, such storage to be effected, if necessary, at the Imperial Governments expense.Sugar. Only one ship was lost, during the week ; another was struck by a torpedo and holed, but,notwithstanding this, managed to get into port. After the issues for the current week have been made the stocks in the country will be equal to about one week&apos;s supply in addition to what arrives during the coming week.During the week ending Tuesday last&apos; the Commission purchased about 48,000 tons and a further offer of 50,000 tons Cuban sugar has been accepted.The Commission is in communication with the London Exchange Committee with regard to financing any purchases that may be made in Java, The position is difficult because the Committee are afraid that any large commitments may break clown the Dutch Exchange.The Commission has made through the Foreign Office a suggestion to the Government of the United.States that the American Domestic Beet Crop should be used up during the current year to a greater extent than is usual so that a larger quantity of Cuban sugar may become available for export to the Allies.Milk. The Advisory Committee appointed by the Food Controller on April 19th to consider and report upon the effect of the existing Milk Order on the production and distribution of milk and the difficulties which had arisen in connexion with the fixing of maximum prices have made the following (amongst other) recommendations as to the lines on which future Milk Orders in England should be framed : (1) That a new Milk &quot;Price Order be issued so as to come into operation on the 15th day of June 1917 and expire on the 30th day of September 1917.A   C33)2955-2   Pk 1   50  S/17   E &amp; S &quot; A
(2) That from the loth.(lay of June. 1917 the. prices payable for milk sold under S        contract until September 30th, 1917, shall be sO regulated as to entitle : . , r, , (a) The\ Producer to a maximum price of 9^. per Imperial gallonin excess of the 1914 summer &quot;price.(b) The Retailer.to a maximum price of 2s. 4d. per Imperial gallon ;                      or Id. per Imperial quart. .(c) That the margin between the wholesalers price and the con-sumer&apos;s price be S-g-ci per Imperial gallon for the period commencing June 15th and ending June 30th, and M. per Imperial gallon for the,. .v. following months of July, August, and September.(d) Having regard, however, to the peculiar difficulties of the London west-end trade the Committee recommend that the rise in&quot;. price to Id. per quart be allowed to come into operation as regardsthat district on the 1st day of June next.(3) That the basis of calculation of prices payable to the producers and distri-butors be the basis adopted by the January and February Orders until the 30th day of September, but that from that date the adoption of a flat rate avoiding the intricate calculations involved in the present Order should, if possible, be adopted.:&apos;: &apos;-: (4) That all contracts in existence on the date of any new Order shall be varied ;. as regards price in accordance with the terms of such Order.Further recommendations of the Committee deal with the regulation at collecting stations for milk and factories and creameries, with the definition and price of accom-modation milk, and with milk production. The latter will be brought to the notice of the Committee appointed by the Board of Agriculture to consider that question.Tea. The methods adopted for ensuring that 40 per cent, of all supplies of tea will be offered to the public at, 2s. 4d. per lb. have proved satisfactory. This tea has now, passed to the retailer and is generally available. Further allocations will be . made every fortnight. A tendency towards a sharp rise in the price of the remaining (50 per cent, of tea has been checked, and the price has fallen Ad. to 5d. per lb., according.to quality, from the recent high level.The Advisory and Control Coinmittees are endeavouring to secure the main-tenance of reasonable prices for all grades of tea. ,fFood Economy.The Food Controller in the House of Lords on May 8 stated that the Food Economy Campaign had been greatly stimulated by His Majesty in the Proclamation issued last week. He confidently expected that during next few weeks substantial results would ensue. He announced his decision to abolish the meatless day in public eating-places as enforced by the Public Meals Order.In connexion with the food economy propaganda over 10,000 leaflets stating the Case from different points of view are now in circulation, while nearly 200,000 posters have been displayed. In Glasgow the Corporation arranged for specially illuminated tramCars to carry speakers, and omnibuses and trams in all the principal towns carry posters or leaflets of some description. 26,000 table cards urging economy, particularly in the use of bread, are being shown in hotels and restaurants. 62 food economy exhibitions have been arranged in places as far north as Shields and as far south as Newport, in the Isle of Wight. 500,000 copies of a war-time cookery book are being distributed.Enforcement of Orders.The Local Government Board has issued, a circular letter to metropolitan boroughs, boroughs, and urban and rural councils enclosing copies of the Local Authorities (Food Control) Order.(No. 1), 1917, made by arrangement with the Food Controller, whereby the powers and duties of enforcing certain provisions of the Food Controllers Ordei-s, :as set out in the schedule thereto, are conferred on local authorities and their officers^ - &apos;   -  :-The Board&apos;s Order leaves-it to the local authority to arrange as.-they think fit for the enforcement of the Orders. &apos; It is suggested that sanitary inspectors or other officials/whose-duties take thenl about, their district couhp-maker inquiry as to the operation of the.Orders in the course of their usual occupations.       :. ; ..-
-4-ru: Jft^jaisxratt^ of^bbt^eafe ini Carder dated the7tli May, authorised local authorities and. their officers to prosecute offences against the provisions of the Orders which they:are.required.-to enforce.There has been some difficulty, in administering the Potatoes Orders in London owing to the arrival of Canadian and South African potatoes of the 1916 crop, to which the Food Controllers Orders are held not to: apply, but which are indistin-a-uishable, except by an expert, from potatoes of the home-grown crop. An opportunity is thiis afforded for&apos;attempted fraud.The enforcement of the Price of Milk Orders, 1917, is generally in abeyance as the issue of a new Order is awaited, but the police have been asked to prosecute two farmers who. have diverted their supplies from the Derby Co-operative Society for illegal prices, and three retailers in the Leeds district who were retailing milk at a halfpenny in excess of the maximum price.PART II-SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION.   ..... imports.    :   - &apos;* -&apos;    - &apos;The imports of food showed some reduction during the week ended 5th May, the total quantity of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs imported,(as shown in Table A.) falling to 197,000 tons, compared with 218,500 tons in the preceding week. They were, however, appreciably above those for the corresponding week in 1916 (187,500 tons), and slightly above the average weekly imports since the beginning of the year (196,000 tons), though considerably below the average&apos;for. the: first 18 weeks of 1916 (nearly 227,000 tons).The reduction is due chiefly to a heavy fall in the imports of sugar and maize. The total quantity of sugar and glucose imported was only 15,500 tons, compared with 33,500 tons in the previous week and an average of nearly 22,000 tons in the first 18 weeks of this year. Maize also showed a fail of 16,000 tons on. the previous week, when the imports were unusually high,.but the reduced quantity received was still above the average.. There were also considerable decreases, as compared both with the previous week and with the average for 1917 up to&apos; date, in the imports of beef, mutton, margarine and barley. During the last three weeks, the average weekly quantity of margarine imported has been little more than one-third of the average lor the previous weeks of the year.There was an improvement, on the other hand, in the imports of wheat, which amounted to nearly 92,400 tons, compared with 74,600 tons in the previous week, and a weekly average of 90,800 tons for the completed portion of 1917. .The imports -.of cheese, butter, and oats were also&quot; better than in the previous week, and those of bacon, hams, and lard continued to be considerably above the average. . . . .    , / -&apos; The total imports of fifteen of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs, in, the.first 18 weeks of 1917, amounted to 3,534,500 tons, compared with 4,080,700,,tons in the corresponding period of 1916 a deficiency of over 546,000 tons,, or 14 per -pent,. The articles mainly responsible for the decrease are barley (168,000 tons), wheat (166,000 tons), oats (159,000 tons), sugar and glucose (133,000 tons), wheaten;flour (59,000 tons), and, beef and mutton (22,000 tons). . Maize shows an increase of 125,500 tons, and the imports of cheese, butter, and lard are also higher. u.;1&apos;;-;consumption of meat and bread. &apos;  .        -      &quot;:Meat. The latest figures available as to the quantities of meat marketed again indicate a marked reduction in consumption. The supplies of dead meat entering the markets at London, Manchester, Glasgow and Liverpool (Table b.) in the week ended 28th April, were in each case lower than in either the preceding week or the corres-ponding week of 1916, the aggregate reduction being 17 per cent, on the previous week and 4-1 per cent, on last year.- During the whole of April, the average weekly supplies were 5 per cent, lower than in March 1917, and 7 per cent, lower than in April 19.16.In London a further reduction is reported for the week ended 5th May, the supplies being 11 per cent, below the weekly average for April; and over 12 per cent, lower than in the corresponding week of 1916. hThe supplies bf fat cattle;-sheep and pigs- received -at; 51 markers (Tabl e! O.) during the week ended &apos;2ndc.MayU.we^A   2955-2 A 2
cent., Hi per&apos; cent, and 16 per cent, respectively. Compared with the averages for the corresponding week in the years 1914 -16, there were reductions of 14 per cent, in cattle, 31 per cent, in sheep and 10 per- cent, in pigs.For the whole of April the average weekly supplies of cattle were rather below the average of March, though a little above the average for April 1914-16; those of sheep were considerably below the averages of March 19.17 and April 1916 ; and those of pigs, while slightlv higher than in March, were somewhat less than in April 1916.Bread. In the Report for last week figures were given showing the quantity of flour used for bread making and confectionery as indicated by returns furnished by 667 members of the National Association of Master Bakers and Confectioners. Returns have since been received from 40 more firms, and the complete figures for the whole 707 firms are as shown below  Quantity of flour used. Period. (Sacks of 280 lbs.).Four weeks ending April 28th, 1917 - - - - 218,313 Four weeks ending March 31st, 1917 - - - - 227,158 Four weeks ending April 29th, 1916 207,695The revised figures agree with those given last week in indicating a decrease of about 4 per cent, in consumption during April as compared with the preceding month, but the increase compared with the corresponding period of 1916 is slightly reduced, being approximately 5 per cent, for the whole 707 firms, instead of 5i- per cent as shown by the 667 returns summarised last week.It was previously pointed out that these returns cover only a small proportion of the total flour consumption of the country, but that they are made by representative firms well scattered over the country and should provide a fair indication of the general trend of consumption.Stocks.In Table E. particulars are given as to the estimated stocks of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs in the United Kingdom at 1st May 1917, with comparative figures for a month before and a year before.Compared with a month before, the estimated stocks of all cereals, except peas, show some reduction. Wheat (including flour expressed as wheat) fell by 138,000 tons, or 11 per cent. ; beans by 10,000 tons, or 14^- per cent., and maize by 15,000 tons, or 9 per cent. The stock of oats has fallen heavily, but the position is not quite so unfavourable as that anticipated a few weeks ago. In view of the &quot;warm weather and other circumstances the estimated rate of consumption has been reduced, while the recent imports have been above the average for the first part of the year.There were considerable reductions in the stocks of chilled and frozen beef and mutton, and of cheese. The stocks of barley, excluding those in the hands of malt-sters, showed no change, but there was a considerable reduction in the maltsters&apos; stocks, which amounted to 238,000 tons on May 1st, 1917 (subject to the receipt of some additional returns not yet to hand) against 310,000 tons on March 10th.There were, on the other hand, large increases in the stocks of butter, bacon, and hams, and substantial improvements in margarine, rice, coffee, and cocoa. Tea and peas show little change.Compared with 1st May, 191.6, the stocks of wheat (including flour) are lower by 408,000 tons, or 27 per cent., those of oats by 195,000 tons, or 39 per cent., and those of maize by 78,000 tons, or 31 i per cent. There is also some deficiency in margarine, cheese, and tea. Barley,.however, shows an increase of 43,000 tons, even apart from the stocks in maltsters&apos; hands (which are now available for human food instead of for brewing).The stocks of beans,.peas, butter, chilled and frozen beef and mutton, bacon, hams, coffee and cocoa, are considerably greater than in May 1916. Rice shows little alteration.: For the chief cereals somewhat later estimates are available, as follows :  Wlieat.-At 7th May the estimated stocks (including flour expressed as wheat), were 1,089,000 tons, compared with 1,177,000 tons four weeks previously, and with 3,496,000 tons; at the corresponding date, of 1916.   Some part of the deficiency as compared with a year ago is, of course, compensated for by the reduction in
consumption resulting from the Manufacture of Flour and Bread Orders, and the Wheat, Rye, and Rice (Restriction) Order. .      -Barley. The estimated stocks, including those in maltsters&apos; hands, were 381,000 tons at 7th May, compared with 458,000 tons a month ago.Oats.-The stocks at 7th May are estimated at 270,000 tons, compared with 490,000 tons a month before, and 584,000 tons at 1st April.Maize.-The estimated stocks at 7th May were 140,000 tons, compared with 151,000 tons a month previously, and 163,000 tons at 1st April.Wholesale Prices.The particulars given in Table D, as to the latest available prices of food and feeding-stuffs, show further reductions in the prices of British grown cereals, as a result of the Wheat, Barley and Oats (Prices) Order, the Gazette average prices having fallen, during the week, by 3s. Qd. per 480 lbs. for wheat, 5s. Id. per 400 lbs. for barley, and 3s. 9d. per 312 lbs. for oats. The prices of imported wheat, rice, and both country and town-made flour in London remain unchanged, but Plate maize shows a rise of 4s. per 480 lbs.As regards meat and bacon, the decreases recorded last week in the prices of English beef and mutton have been practically nullified by increases of 4sc 6c?. and 5s. per cwt. Argentine beef also shows a rise of Is. Qd. per cwt.. and the prices of Irish and Canadian bacon are higher by Is. and Is. Qd. per cwt. respectively; but Argentine mutton shows a further fall of 15s. per cwt. (following one of 7s, Qd. last week) and the decrease of 3s. per cwt. recorded last week in the price of Danish bacon has been extended to a total of 6s.- The prices of Irish&apos; and New Zealand butter have fallen by-2s. per cwt. and there is also a slight reduction (Qd. per cwt.) in Danish butter. Cheese and sugar remain unchanged, but-the prices bid for tea sold at the aucfions showed another sharp rise, amounting generally to 2d. or 3d. per lb. Among the oilseeds and cake, Calcutta linseed increased in price by 10s. per ton, linseed cake by 12s. per ton, and palm kernel cake by 20s. per ton, but there was a reduction of 80s. per ton in palm kernels.Compared with a month ago, there are increases of 125s. per ton in Calcutta linseed, 55s. per ton in linseed cake, 53s. per ton in palm kernel cake, 35s. per ton.in palm kernels, 23s. per ton on cottonseed cake, 5s. per 480 lbs. in Plate maize, 3s. Qd. and 4s. Qd. per cwt. respectively in Irish and Canadian bacon, Is. 9ti per cwt. in rice, and Is. per sack of 280 lbs. in flour in London (both town made and country&apos;&quot; straight run &quot;).   Tea also shows large increases varying with different qualities.The principal reductions in price are 16s. per cwt. and 1 Is. per -cwt. respectively in Danish and New Zealand butter, 15s. per cwt. in Argentine mutton, 8s. Qd. per cwt. in Argentine chilled beef; 6s. dd. per 480 lbs. in British. wheat, and 5s. Id. per 400 lbs. in British barley. There arc also small reductions in the prices of English beef and mutton and Danish- bacon. Imported wiieat, cheese and sugar show no change.Since the &quot;corresponding date in. 1916, there have been marked increases in the prices;of nearly all the commodities included in the Table. The articles most affected are oilseeds and oilseed cake, palm kernel cake having risen in price by 183s. per ton (or 129 per cent.), linseed cake by 191s. per ton (or 76 per cent.), and Calcutta linseed by 296s. per ton (or 73 per cent.). The price of tea also shows a large increase, common whole leaf tea sold at auction last week being quoted at about Is. 9c?. per lb., compared with approximately Is. a year ago (also a period of unusually high prices) and about 8-lcl. per lb.&apos;at-the corresponding date of 1914. Even when allow-ance is made for the &quot;controlled&quot; tea allocated direct to buyers at Is. per lb., the average price of tea last Week was nearly Qd. per lb., or almost 50 per cent., above the average for the corresponding week of 1916, and practically double the average price at the same date in 1914. At the sales held this week, however, there has been a sharp relapse in prices..The &quot;Gazette&apos;&quot; price of British oats has risen by 21s. lid. per .312 lbs. (or 67 per cent.) since a year ago, that of British wheat by 22s. per 480 lbs. (or 39^ per cent.) and that of British barley by 2.1: per cent. Rangoon and Bassein rice shows a rise of 52 per cent., and Plate maize one; of 42 per cent. There are also increases of 45 to 47 per cent, in the prices.of cheese ; 20 to 381 per cent, in those of bacon, and 21 to 28J, per cent, in butter. 7&quot;
Retail Prices.In the Report for the week ended 11th April, statistics were given showing the course of retail food prices from the outbreak of war to the beginning of April 1917. In Tables F and G the figures are brought up to 1st May 1917.   .From Table F it will be seen that there was a further rise during April in the retail prices of nearly all of the principal articles of food, the general percentage increase over &quot; normal prices in July 1914&quot; being 97&apos; 6 at 1st May, compared with 94 - 4 a month previously. The principal increase was in potatoes, the price of which rose by 25 per cent, (calculated on &quot;normal prices of July 1914 &quot;), consequent upon the increase of Id. per lb. in the official maximum price at the beginning of April. There were also increases of 7 per cent, (on July 1914 prices) in margarine and fish, 6 per cent, in tea, 5  per cent, in eggs, 5 per cent, in flour and cheese, 4 per cent, in bread, 2  to 5 per cent, in mutton and 1 to t\ per cent, in beef. The only article showing a decrease was butter, the price of which fell by over 6 per cent, (on July 1914 prices).For all the principal articles combined, the average monthly rate of increase during the war, expressed as a percentage of prices in July 1914, has been as follows : -Per cent.July-December, 1914 January-June, 1915        July-December, 1915 J anuary-June, 191G July-December, 1916 January, 1917 February, 1917 - March, 1917 April, 1917 -Average for the whole period       -        &quot; -      2&apos; 9The average increase during April 1917, is less than in April 1916 (when it was 5&quot;7 per cent.), but it is greater than in April 1915 (2*2 per cent.) or than the&quot; monthly average for the whole period of the war (2&apos; 9 per cent.).The articles showing the greatest increase in price at 1st May 1917, as compared with July 1914 are sugar (172 percent.), breasts of frozen mutton (162 per cent,), potatoes (142 per cent.), fish (138 per cent.), and cheese (122 per cent.). Other articles of which the prices have been more than doubled are the cheaper cuts of British beef and mutton, ribs of chilled and frozen beef, legs of frozen mutton, and flour. The articles showing least increase are margarine (56 per cent.), milk (61 per cent.), tea (69 per cent.), and butter (70 to 73 per cent.).        ...During April, there was another marked increase in the prices of the subsidiary: foods included in Table G, especially butter beans, the price of which, in London, rose by about Ad. per lb. (or over 100 per cent, on the price prevailing at July 1914V Haricot beans also rose by Id. to l^d. per lb. (or an average of 56 per cent, of the July 1914 prices), lentils by 37 per cent., sago by 30 per cent., and split peas by 27 per cent. The arithmetical average of the increases in all the articles included in the table was 32 - 4 per cent., compared with 42 &quot;4 per cent, in March, and 31*6 per cent, in February. During the same three months the increases in the prices of the principal foods, included in Table F, were only 3&apos;2 per cent., 2&apos;3 per cent., and 3&apos; 3 per cent, respectively.The average increases since the beginning of 1917, expressed as percentages of prices in July 1914, have amounted to 234 per cent, for haricot beans, 213 per cent, for butter beans, 170 per cent, for sago, 138per cent, for lentils, and 100 per cent, for tapioca. The smallest increases have been in Patna rice (18 per cent.) and Rangoon rice (57 per cent.).At 1st May, the average prices of the articles included in the table ranged from a minimum of about twice those of July 1914 in the case of rice, up to four-and-a-half times those of July 1914 in the case of haricot beans.3-12-4 2-12-6 4-3 2-0 3-3 2-3 3-2
