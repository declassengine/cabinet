The?, IRISH QUEST I Off,/2  /?     &apos;3V      1(Copy of a letter from Sir John B*Lonsdale to the Prime Minister, dated 17th May,1917)-;Dear; Prime Minister,&quot; In reply to your letter enclosing me a;.-copy of the-proposal which&apos; you halve: submitted, on behalf of the-Government, to Mr Redmond, as representing the Nationalist Party, ;&apos;and tome as-representing the&apos; ulster Unionist Party, I desire tosay that -I have&apos; had-:an. opportunity of consulting with my Ulster - Colleagues.You &quot;will not,Iam sure,expect me at present to reply in detail&apos;to your letter.We are fully conscious of &quot;the great necessity that exists,at&quot;&quot;.the present time 6f doing everything possible tc promote the closer unity of all&apos; parts of the Empire,in order&quot;that we may bring to a speedy and victorious conclusion the terrible War^hich has been forced upon us by German ambitions, and thereby winning a Tictory for civilisation and humanity.We would like to point /out that-, since the beginning of the War the Unionists of&apos;Ulster have thrown&apos; themselves-&apos; whole heartedly into the vfcrk of carrying on the War, and have taken little, if any, part in Political controversy.     They were impelled to that course by their -traditionary loyalty to the Crown and pride&apos;in,their citizenship of the Empire, and their desire to give the State every assistance in their power at this supreme crisis in cur history.        They have been greatly encouraged by ycur recent&quot;announcement,on. behalf of the Government, that no Policy which-&apos;entailed the. coercion of Ulster could qt would be entertained.We know that the people cf Ulster are as strongly opposed as ever they were to the entire policy of Home Rule $cr Ireland but they have shown by their action when a compromise was attempted last year,;.that they are not&apos; unwilling to consider the exigencies of the present situation.&apos; .- We have no pov/ar to bind the Ulster people .to-the acceptance.&apos; f the proposals which you now put forward, as we have always undertaken that, before entering into anything into the nature of a compromise.cn the Home Rule question, we - would lay any proposals, before the Ulster Unionist&apos;Council, which is directly-representative of Unionist opinion throughtcut the Province.We are, therefore, prepared to submit the suggestions for a settlement contained in. your letter to that Organisation&apos; and&quot; we&apos; feel we are entitled to add.that v/e shall, recommend them for careful,consideration, with an earnest desire that a decision may be arrived at which-will promote the peace and security of* the United Kingdom and.the success of the great cause which we are fighting in this War.&quot;Yours sincerely,(Signed):. JOHN B.LOHSDALE.
