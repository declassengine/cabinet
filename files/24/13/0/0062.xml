DESPATCH No. 16.From Lieut.-Colonel J. M. Blair, Assistant Military Attache. Subject : GENERAL   SITUATION.British Embassy, Petrograd,20th April, 1917.Situation at the Front.1. Until Colonel Knoxs and Major Thornhill&apos;s reports are received from the front, it is difficult to know what the real state of discipline there is, though reports of officers, who come daily to the Embassy, and ask to be allowed to serve in the British Army, give very gloomy accounts of the future outlook.2. Reports from Russian officers. It is said here that it is no use to pay attention to these reports, as the officers who bring them are officers who are not in sympathy with their men, and are therefore not the sort of officers who are wanted at this critical time. Further, that the mere fact of their wanting to leave the army at a time when officers are so badly needed shows that they lack the characteristics most essential to an officer.3. I admit there is much to be said for the above, but in spite of that I attach the greatest importance to their reports, for the following reasons : Firstly, nearly all I have seen are officers who have served all through the war or the greater part of it, tbey are well educated and have had a military training in addition to their practical experience in the field. They are imbued with regimental traditions, and they have been accustomed to enforce discipline strictly, certainly in some cases too severely and not on lines recognised by us, but it must be remembered that the Russian soldier has to be handled in a different way to the British. They are in fact the officers who could get something out of the Russian soldier, and are therefore die ones least liked. Those liked are usually the slackers who will never get anything out of the men, as there is not the same mutual feeling of comradeship in the Prussian Army that there is in the British. Russian officers are not in touch with the men to anything like the extent that British officers are. When these officers apply to go to England we try to persuade them that they, should endeavour to get authority back in their hands, but the answers they give clearly show what their frame of mind is, and how difficult it will be to get any more good out of them. They one and all say that it is impossible to get back their hold on the men.4. Lack, of discipline. From the instances of lack of discipline that these officers give, one cannot help coming to the regrettable conclusion that the capacity of the Russian Army as a fighting machine has gone, and that discipline enforced by soldier committees during war means that no commander can possibly be sure that arrangements he makes to meet any given situation will be carried out. This means that there can be no thought of any offensive, and the only question is whether the Russian Army can be relied on to hold on where it is. Certainly, at the present moment, if the Germans concentrated strongly against any part of the Russian line, in my opinion, there is no point in that line at which they could not break through.5. No offensive possible. All officers I have spoken to say that there can be no offensive, and they also admit that the army, in its present state, could not withstand a serious attack.If there was any prospect of an early restoration of discipline, and a consequent increasing of the fighting efficiency of the Russian Army, the situation would not be so serious.6. As the officers have lost all authority (even those who have been retained in their units say that they have lost all control), it stands to reason that no operations can be undertaken with any vigour. Even the most minor operations require leaders, and if the leaders do not even know whether they will be followed, much less obeyed, it is impossible to expect that any success can result. In fact, it means probably that no operations at all will be undertaken except those forced on them.(B17/327)   20   5/17   Jl&amp;B   4550wo
7. No improvement likely. With the officers in the frame of mind that they are in at present&apos;(numbers of them have thrown up the sponge entirely, and are making no effort to gain back their authority), and so long as the men who have taken part in this complete overthrow of discipline remain, there seems no prospect of any improvement in the situation. On the contrary, as political agitators are still given a free hand, the situation as regards discipline can only get worse.The only salvation of the situation would appear to be if the men were in time to realize that without trained officers they are helpless. A Colonel of the Guards told me that he thinks this would happen if the Germans attacked and drove the Russian line back. The present line held by the Russians has been fortified by trained officers. If driven out of it and forced to form a new line, he thinks the men would have forcibly driven home to them the r61e which their officers play, and would come round to looking to them for guidance and direction.8. Passive attitude. Officers from the front also tell me that two other factors are influencing the men to adopt a very passive attitude at present. These are, firstly, the Government declaration of &quot; no annexation,&quot; which is being interpreted by the men to mean that they are to sit quietly in their trenches ; and, secondly, an idea which has somehow got about that the Allies only require Russia to hold the line she now occupies and that they, the Allies, will do the rest. This, too, has been given precisely the same interpretation as the Government^ &quot; no annexation &quot; declaration.In view of the optimism expressed (one cannot help wondering if it is felt) by members of the Government, theories on the discipline question, such as have been expressed above, are looked upon as rank pessimism; but as the whole future conduct of the war on this front depends on the discipline question, and if facts are faced, it seems not only wrong, but absolutely impossible, to paint the picture in a rosy light.9. The Northern front. The Northern front has always been admitted to be the worst as regards discipline, especially in the towns of Riga and Dvinsk.10. The Western front. General Gurko, Commander of the Western front, considers the worst has passed in regard to the revolution and its effects on the army on this front. He says the spring offensive has been delayed, and preparations cannot commence before 15th May. He cannot say when actual offensive will begin. He blames Higher Command for not taking decisive steps and directing the course of the revolution, in so far as it affected the army, instead of following behind the wave of unrest.General Kvetsinski, Commander of 3rd Army, says discipline has not suffered, but instead of the staff working at military problems they are obliged to spend their time at meetings of officers and soldier deputies making speeches.General Lebedev, Quartermaster-General, Western front, considers the wave ot unrest has not yet passed, but he thinks a modus vivendi will be evolved as between officers and men, and in his opinion the army will be a better machine than before. This desired result will be attained if the Government get the upper hand of the Council of Working Men and Soldier Deputies in Petrograd, but if the opposite, he fears anarchy will result. The Council has much influence in the army, but the troops at the front are everywhere expressing displeasure at the behaviour of the working men in Petrograd. He says Spring offensive has not been delayed, and position as regards ammunition is no worse than before the revolution.There were no serious disorders in units at the Western front. In some units officers were arrested, but have since been released. No officer was killed either in units at the front, or depot units in rear, in the region of the armies of the Western front.At Smolensk, Briansk and Kaluga there were more serious disorders than in any unit at the front, but according to Gurko, Lebedev and Kvetsinski matters are settled between officers and men, and these three officers did not show in any way that they were depressed at the outlook for the future.Desertions, which at one time reached a high figure, have decreased owing to the matter haying been put in the hands of the mens committees.Divisional, regimental, battalion and company committees have been formed. Their sphere of activity has been defined in Army Orders by Gurko, and is confined to interior economy.There is no unit which has been allowed to adopt the system of selecting officers. The committees have already justified their formation by the assistance &quot;they have rendered.Men are saluting officers with few exceptions, and in any case the impression after Petrograd is heartening. I will report more fully when I have had further opportunities of conversation with all ranks.
The day after receipt of Major ThornhilTs letter an artillery officer from Molodechno came to the Embassy with a very gloomy account of the condition of artillery units at that place.   He said that many officers had been removed from their units.11. South- Western front-The South-Western front was always said to be the best as regards the state of discipline, but officers from the Special Army did not bear this out. It is true that they reported no excesses on the part of the men beyond temporary arrest of some of the officers, but they made it quite plain that the officers&apos; position was there just as difficult as anywhere.12. Professor Pared Report.-Professor Pares, * who has arrived from the 8th Army, gives the following account of the situation there : &quot; The position in those parts of the army for which I can speak is very serious. In the 8th Army the Quartermaster-General tells me he looks with great apprehension at the near future. The Army Commander, General Kaledin, says the same, and that those responsible for discipline and effective work are loaded with a responsibility which can hardly be met. The Chief of Staff of Kiev Military District, General Bredov, formerly Quartermaster-General of the Northern front (before the war his present post was held by General Alexeyev) says with emphasis, &apos; We are not in a state to defend ourselves !&apos; He adds that there are a very great number of deserters as they simply turn up (in Kiev) and no one has the proper power to stop them. A notice has been put up at all stations in this part, &apos; Deserters are the enemies of the free people.&apos; The XVIIIth Corps (8th Army), General Zaionchkovski, is extremely anxious as to the situation. In 43rd Division of this corps, where I have been living, a peculiarly able Chief of Staff has so far saved the situation. In the neighbouring 64th Division (same corps), where our English motor column, stands, an officer was torn to pieces by&apos; the men (16 wounds; lungs torn out; body left lying and the men will not have it removed) apparently for saying the present Government would be overturned after demanding stricter discipline. (I have seen the army judge who investigated the case.) In Illrd Caucasian Corps (Vllth Army) General Irmanov holds things at present, as I am told, by the tradition of their fine reputation and his immense personal popularity ; but he has expressed great anxiety, which is shared by his officers who are greatly mortified at the failure of discipline and the failure to play up to the Allies, consoling themselves only by the English offensive which they most warmly appreciated. In the 9th Army (formerly General Lechitsky) I am told discipline still holds but cannot last more than a month unless the cases of dislocation are sharply altered. From other parts officers speak of men who have simply piled their arms and left the trenches. Officers have explained to me that they cannot possibly secure discipline by words alone and that they feel that they have no authority to punish. One of the general officers quoted above spoke to me of nearly a million of deserters. This may be an exaggeration, but I feel sure it is more than the War Minister knows of. According to every sign, our train from Czernovitz to Petrograd was packed with them. Some four attempts were made on my own coupee (1st class), but by casual officers, who were of a kind quite unusual in Russia.&quot; The opinion of officers seems to me to be quite agreed. I have met no supporters of the old regime. All were in favour of the first changes. From this time dated a strong feeling that the German game was up, and as one Colonel put it to me, that they (the Germans) had nothing left to fight for. - Discipline for a time even improved noticeably. The first doubts came with the talk of a Constituent Assembly (not wanted at first) as the officers felt this was no time for such questions and that the army, which is the flower of the people was likely to be left out in the discussion. Their views was &apos; everything for the war, and talk later.&apos; All reasoned opinions expressed to me were in favour of a constitutional monarchy, and much was said in favour of the Grand Duke Michael. The Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies sent up at once emissaries, who got at the troops, with the result that the men practically wholesale pronounced for a republic&apos; This the officers accepted without difficulty; then main point was that the army should not be tampered with. This, however, was done by the emissaries. They have everywhere brought in a split between officers and men, which as I can warmly testify, as living with the army, did not before exist. As General Kaledin told the emissaries, it was the most democratic army in the world (i.e., in the broadest sense, but without political formalities). The order to officers to say &apos; You&apos; and not &apos; Thou&apos; to soldiers is entirely out of place. &apos; Thou &apos; was in nine cases out of ten an affectionate form of address, familiar to the men amongst themselves; no one would* Professor Pares was sent to Russia by the Foreign Office and is attached to the Kussian Army as an &quot; eye-witness.&quot;(4550)
have minded it much in time of peace, but now the officers have it as an intimation to the men at the front that the former discipline does not exist. The men take it that way ; but the serious cause of mortification among the officers is that the Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies speaks without any right in the rear of the enemy (for the military elements are reservists and recruits) and that it assumes the functions of a government. It is explained that the Council has captured the railways and the factories. The ideas the Council advocate (8 hours&apos; day, &amp;c.) are regarded by the officers as sheer madness at this time. There are signs that the same view is coming to be taken by many of the soldiers at the front and even by the soldier members of this Council. Guchkov is severely criticised for not standing out against the Council and still more for not having stopped it from getting at the enemy. The army repre-sentative committees must be regarded as a countermove of the Provisional Government, and are in many cases working fairly well and talking mainly of questions of domestic economy; they are consultative in character, though they might easily prejudice the authority of the commanding officer.&quot;Situation in Petrograd.13. The situation in Petrograd continues as before, a prolonged struggle between the temporary Government and the Council of Working Men&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Deputies for power. Details of the events which have occurred in this struggle have been sent home to the Foreign Office by his Excellency, the Ambassador.14. Armed workmen. The worst feature is that the workmen have now got arms, which in the event of the downfall of the Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies, they will probably use. General Kornilov published a proclamation a day or two ago saying that during the revolution days 40,000 rifles and 30,000 revolvers were looted from the Artillery Department, and calling on all those who were in possession of them to give them up. As he pointed out, the quantity of rifles was more than that required to arm a corps, and that at a time when rifles were urgently needed at the front it was essential that they should be given up. Any of these that are in the hands of the workmen will certainly not be given up.15. Workmen and soldiers. There was for some time considerable grumbling on the part of the soldier against the workmen on the question of the 8 hours&apos; day, and the workmen undoubtedly felt it. They said that though they insisted on an 8 hours&apos; day, they were quite prepared to work overtime ; but refused, with justice, to hold themselves responsible if there was a stoppage of work due to insufficient supply of fuel and raw material.Since then several soldier deputations have visited factories, and as a result have issued notices that the reports stating that the workmen were not working at full pressure were false, and that they were satisfied as a result of their visits that the workmen were doing all they could.16. No military training. Sunday, 15th April, was Russian Easter Sunday. For some days previous no training at all was done by the garrison. Training did not recommence till Thursday, 19th.In fairness to the troops, however,&apos; it must be said that they have in other directions done useful work, They have, probably, saved a serious epidemic by clearing the streets of the winter snow, which would otherwise, in the absence of workmen, have been left untouched. Also they have been employed in unloading wagons of supplies at the Petrograd stations, thus saving a most serious situation which had been caused by the introduction of the 8-hour day for all workmen. It also eased the food question which at one time, as regards bread, reached as almost an acute stage as it had on the days immediately preceding the revolution, and which would not have been solved had not the Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies insisted on bakers working beyond the 8 hours a day which, in the present universal total disregard for anything but self, was the attitude adopted by the members of the baking trade.17. Confer ences. A conference of representatives from various branch Councils of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies in Russia and on the front has been held in Petrograd. It was decided to investigate on the following points :  (i.) Their attitude to the war. (ii.) Their attitude to the temporary Government.(iii.) Organization questions concerning the Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies.(iv.) Organization of revolutionary forces and the combating of counter-revolution.
(v.) Preparation for the Constitutive Assembly, (vi.) Food question.&quot; (vii.) Land question.(viii.) Other questions concerning peasant life, (ix.) The workman question.(x.) Questions concerning soldiers and military life.Of these questions the first two were to be decided at a general meeting, while the others were to be delegated to specially formed committees.The resolution passed at a general meeting extending over several days on the first two, the most important questions were communicated to the Foreign Office in a despatch from his Excellency the Ambassador.18. War Ministry. M. Gutchkov has been hampered from the start by the difficulty in getting assistants. He has now got four, namely, General Manikowski. General Novitski, General Filaliev, Senator Garin. The two last named are not considered to be satisfactory, especially Senator Garin, who I am told is far from helpful to his chief.M. Gutchkov, like certain other of the ministers, is not sparing himself. During the short time he has been in office he has already done tours on the Northern and Western fronts, visiting on these occasions the trenches. He has now left for a tour of inspection of the South-Western and Roumanian fronts. Former War Ministers used to visit the Stavka occasionally, but as far as I know none of them visited fronts except Sukhomlinov.While in Petrograd, I am told he personally sees all who wish to interview him. which takes up an enormous amount of his very valuable time, He cannot be persuaded to delegate this to a suitable assistant. He has apparently now got a curiously fixed idea in his head that he is going to be assassinated.19. Changes in higher commands. Very drastic measures have been taken by the temporary Government in regard to removing inefficient commanders, and the results should be very beneficial.., General Alexeyev was officially confirmed in his appointment as Commander-in-Chief on the 15th April.General Sakharov, assistant to Commander-in-Chief of Roumanian front, was to have been succeeded by General Letchitski,* Commander of 9th Army, but it is said that the latter has asked to retire on account of ill-health, and General Scherbachev has been appointed instead.General Yudenich, on appointment to command Caucasian Front vice the Grand Duke Nicholas, was succeeded in his command of Caucasian Army by General Prjevalski, who formerly commanded Ilnd Turkestan Corps.General Baratov has-handed over command of the Russian troops in Persia to General Pavlov, who formerly commanded Vlth Cavalry Corps. General Baratov has received command of a Corps on the Caucasian front.20. Proclamations. Several proclamations have been issued by the War Minister, which owing to the want of time will be held over till next despatch. Amongst.other matters dealt with is the question of soldiers travelling by rail. They are still not only causing great dislocation of traffic, but are also ruining rolling stock, both matters of vital importance at the present moment.JAMES M. BLAIR, Lieut.-Colonel,Assistant Military Attache.* General Letchitski has since retired and has been succeeded by General Byelkovich in the command of the 9 th Army.
