Operations.   &apos; SecreteFrom G.O.C. in C, Egypt. -To,   C.I.G.S. 12th Hay, 1917.7.40. p.m.A.He 1902.There is no?/ at sea on the way home a full appreciation of the situation on Palestine front.     In case the Har Cabinet may desire earlier information as to the situation following is a brief resume of main points  : -&quot;The following enemy divisions are now estimated to be disposed In the front line between Gaza and Bir Saba :    3rd, 7th, 16th, 53rd, 54th, 3rd Cavalry and part of 27th Infantry Division, In reserve remainder of 27th probably whole of 56th Division and part of 43rd, that Is 6 Infantry divisions on front line, 8 in whole theatre.       Numerical strength is difficult to estimate but it might be put at 33,000 effective rifles, 2,200 sabres, and 130 machine guns and 120 guns.       South of Damascus perhaps a total force of   45,000 rifles, 2,200 sabres, 133 machine guns and 152 guns,Disposition as follows3rd. and 7th Divisions at Gaza.53rd Division   about Khirbit el Bir.16th Division about Atawin*h and Sharia,54th Division in the neighbourhood of Sharia, with elements at Bir Saba,Positions strongly entrenched.I am now, as a result of my recent operations, closely in touch with enemy on a front of some 14,000 yards from Sheikh Ajlim, on the sea to the N.E, corner of Sheikh Abbas ridge.   Prom that point my line turns back through Sharta towards the Wadi Ghuzze with my right flank extended to Shellal for protecting my southern flank and to deny to the enemy the valuable water supplies lying in the Had! at that point.   Arrangements are being made in the meantime to construct a branch line of the railway as rapidly as possible from Rafa to the neighbourhood of Shellal to enable me to conduct operations on a broader front than is meanwhile possible from the single railhead at Deir el Belah,     Every endeavour Is also being made to strengthen the northern portion of my position from the sea to&apos; Sharia so as to set free as many troops as possible which will be concentrated on release, as a general reserve to meet an enemy threat against my right flank or to undertake offensive operations in event of the situation admitting of such a course tThe scope of my offensive action must for the time being however be governed by the fact that, exclusive of my mounted troops, I have at present only 3 divisions fully trained and equipped with which to carry out operations of such a nature. These divisions, namely 52nd, 53rd, 54th, are moreover at present under strength as a result of recent casualties and sickness and
in order to complete them to war establishment I require immediately infantry reinforcements amounting In round numbers to 350 officers and 9,000 other ranks.   Demand for these has been made through normal channels.   At present 74th Division consists of 3 Infantry Brigades with 2 field companies Royal Engineers recently formed from Army Troops Companies, but is without artillery.   At present 75th Division exists merely on paper, only 1 Brigade namely 232nd having as yet been., formed.     Too sick to be sent to the front.     I am forced, therefore, in these circumstances, to the opinion that my strength is insufficient to justify an attempt to undertake general offensive operations meanwhile and I therefore intend to assume for the time being an active defensive whilst pressing forward preparations for resumption of vigorous offensive as soon as the situation admits.2* have also sent fey last mail an appreciation of therailway situation, of which following is. a brief resume.A.   The capacity of the existing single line from Kantara to Deir el Belah is sufficient for maintenance of a force operating at or in advance of railhead 5 Divisions (at full strength) 8 Mounted Brigades and. 1 Camel Brigade in addition to Camel Transport Corps and all troops allotted to Lines of .C ommuni cation.B. By the construction of additional sidings and crossing, places, by enlarging existing stations and by increase in supply of engines, rolling stock etc. estimated that the capacity of the line can be developed to provide for the maintenance of 1 additional mounted division and 1 additional division.This work, which will, it is calculated take about 3 months to complete,has already been taken in hand and will be pressed forward as quickly as possible.C. In event,however, of the War Cabinetfs deciding to send any considerably larger force to this theatre in the autumnit will be essential to double line throughout.     Provided necessary material construction personnel etc., can be provide^ without undue delay estimated that operation will take approx- \ imately 8 months to carry out.     Since, however, the necessity &apos;\ of the larger project, namely, doubling of line, must depend     \ upon War Cabinet1s intention with regard to future policy in this theatre, your instructions have been requested and are now awaited on this point.3. The present situation on Eastern front may be summar-&apos;ised as followsReference Sinai - Rafa sheet 1/250,000.     A continuous wired and entrenched line has been constructed from the sea at Sheikh Ajlin to Sheikh Abbas ridge across Gaza Rafa road.. . From there line turns back through El Mundar to V-adi Ghuzze about Tel el Jemmi.   &apos; This latter portion of line consists of strong wired posts.      Main line ( 1 group undecipherable) continued west of Wadi by further series of strong posts to Well Sheikh Nuran which position is also entrenched and. wired.     East of Wadi Ghuzze defensive position strong posts is in preparation,Fallowing is distribution of troops on this line52nd Division holds from sea Mansura ridge exclusive.54th Division plus 1 Brigade 74th Division attached holds from &apos;F ?fi inclusive to Tel el Jemmi.

Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division concentrated near Shellal less 1 Brigade holding line outposts on east bank of rradi -... Ghuzze as far south as El Gamli.Imperial Mounted Division and Camel Brigade concentrated in neighbourhood of Abasan el Kebir.A spur of railway from Rafa towards Shellal has reached Kilo 5,39, Pipe line from Khanyunis through Abasan el Kebir to Abu Sitar constructed- and in service as far as Abasan el Kebir.Pipe line from Rafa to Abu Khatli begun and 8 kilo pipe ready for ? distribution.     I propose whenever the spur of railway, and pipe lines have been complet&apos; d to advance my main line of resistance to the east side of the Wadi Gkuzze at Shellal to secure valuable.water supplies at that, place., Any further, offensive operations must depend on arrival of drafts for completion and maintenance of divisions up to strength/ upon&apos;the progress, training and equipment of 74th and.75th Divisions and upon&apos; the rate at which railway construction and water aevelopment proceed-in- the. area of operations,.
