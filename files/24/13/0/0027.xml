COPYWAR   CABINET.SECRETG.T. 727 MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY EOR SCOTLANDANENT THE LIQUOR PROBLEM.At the risk of wearying the War Cabinet, I feel bound to ask them again to consider the case of Scotland in relation to the liquor problem.     After all, I am, for the time being, responsible for the administration of affairs in that country, and I am seriously alarmed at the prospect if the proposed Government policy is applied there without modification.The case of Scotland is very special .     I am not surprised that temperance reformers in England hail with delight the solution proposed, namely, purchase plus local option.     Most of them dislike purchase, but they consider - and from their point of view I think they are right - that purchase is not too high a price to pay for local option - a reform which they could not reasonably look for during the present generation apart from this deal.The case in Scotland is quite different.     There we have already secured local option, though for a few years its operation is suspended.     By mere efflux of time it will mature. Accordingly, the proposed policy involves imposing upon Scotland a doctrine which is repugnant to the vast majority of her people;   while differing from England, she gets no quid pro quo for assenting to it.To accelerate the operation of the Temperance Act does not provide a solution of the difficulty.     The petition against State Purchase which has been signed by thirty of my.Scottish colleagues, is a petitiion also directed against the acceleration of the Act.     The reasons for this attitude are two in number:-(l)     The measure was designed for operation in peace time,
and to put it in operation during war time, in the absence of thousands of voters, would probably render the whole machinery of the Act ineffective.(2)     To propel the operation of the Act involves legislation, and that means that the Act would be again in the melting pot, and that the old bitter and prolonged con-troversies regarding areas, options, etc, would be revived. In the result the Act, which is regarded by temperance refor-mers in Scotland as sacred as the Ark of the Covenant, might be mutilated beyond recognition.What then should be done?     I venture to suggest to the War Cabinet for consideration, whether it might not be possible to control the liquor trade in Scotland, without purchasing it, until, by efflux of time, the Act comes into operation and a popular vote has been taken.     Such a course, if it is feasible would probably commend itself to extremists on both sides. If the initial polls under the Act show a widespread tendency towards restrictive measures, the purchase price would be pro-portionally reduced.     If, on the other hand, the experience of the working of the Act indicates that there is no strong desire to diminish facilities for obtaining liquor, the purchas price would be so much the higher.If the proposed course is not found to be feasible, then I venture to suggest to the War Cabinet that I should be authorised to meet my Scottish colleagues and to explain to them the course which the Government proposes to pursue, and the reasons for it.     To do so, would not, I think, after the report of the deputations which the Prime Minister received last Friday, involve giving away any secret.I should add that the last official view which I have received from Scotland on the question is that of the Executive of the Scottish Liberal Association, which met last week, underScottish Office. 14th May, 1917.
