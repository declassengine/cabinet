The C ommander-in-Shief,Egyptian Expeditionary Force.To,The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, War Office,   London, S.W.General Headquarters,Egyptian Expeditionary ? 7th May, 1917.Sir,1,     In continuation of my cipher telegram No. 0, 328 of the 22nd April, 1917, I have the honour to bring to your notice certain developments in the situation in this theatre which,  since the inception of my advance into PALESTINE some seven weeks ago, has undergone a marked change,2.     On March 17th, 1917 the effective strength of the enemy forces disposed against me in Southern Palestine was estimated at 19,000 rifles, with 40 to 50 guns and 1,500 sabres,       This total comprised the 3rd and 16th Divisions, with the addition of certain unattached regiments belonging to tther formations, some Austrian and German artillery units, and, the 3rd Turkish Cavalry Division..Since that time, however, as a result of my advance, and in consequence of the inactivity of the Russian Armies in the CAUCASUS, tho enemy has diverted to this theatre very considerable reinforcements, and in addition to replacing the very heavy casualties Inflicted upon him during the recent operations, prisoners&apos; statements indicate that he has been able, further, tcbuild up the majority of his battalions to approximately full- strength.     Reports regarding the strengths if enemy battalions are, however, to some extentconflicting
2.conflicting, and in view of this factor of uncertainty, it is impossible to form an absolutely reliable estimate of the actual numbers at present disposed against me.   Prior to the 20th April, however, it is improbable that the average strength of Turkish battalions on this front amounted to more than 600 to 650 rifles, whilst there is now strong reason to believe that this average has risen to approximately 750 rifles per battalion, representing an increase of nearly 20 per cent.3.    In addition to the reinforcement, by drafts, of units previously engaged in this theatre, the transfer t-* this front of a number of new formations has now been definitely estab-lished,The following enemy divisions are now estimated to be disposed in the front line between GA2.A and BIR SABA 3rd,  7th, 16th, 53rd, 54th, 3rd Cavalry, and part of the 27th Infantry Division,  of which the 7th Division is the latest arrival.    In reserve, the remainder of the 27th Division, probably the whole of the 56th Division and part of the 43rd Division,It would appear, therefore,  that the enemy has now con-centrated nearly six infantry divisions on his front line, and that the total force at his disposal in the whole theatre may amount to eight divisions in all.   Moreover,  there is no doubt that he has of late received considerable reinforcements in artillery and machine gun units,  as well as in mounted troops, although definite identifications of the latter have not yet been established.    To summarise the above,  it io probable that the strength of the enemy actually opposed to me at present on the GAZA - BIR SABA line may be estimated at 33,000 effective rifles, 2,200 sabres, 130 machine guns and 120 guns, while, including formations in reserve south of DAMASCUS,  the enemy1s total forces appear to amount to about45,000
45,000 rl-flea, 2,200 sabres,. 133 machine guns and 132 guns.49        According t-o any information, it appears that theenemy forces, oocupying his front line, are at presentdisposed from North-west to South-east as follows3rd and 7th Divisions at GAZA. 53rd Division about KRTRBIT EL BIR, &apos;   16th Division about ATA^INEH and SHARIA.54th Division in the neighbourhood of SHARIiL, withelements at BIR SABA. 27th Division - elements at BIR SABA.The enemyrs position is very strongly entrenched in theneighbourhood of GAZA and ATAOT3H, whilst a system ofstrongly fortified-localities between those places andBIR SABA render mobile operations by my mounted troopsin rear of the enemy*s line impossible.5.        As a result of my recent operations, I am now closely in touch with the enemy on a front of some 14,000 yards from SHSLKH AJLIN, on the sea, to the North-east ,corner of the SHEIKH ABBAS- ridge*     From that point my line turns back through SHARTA towards the- WALT GHITZZE, with my right flank extended to SHELLAL, in order to protect my southern flank, and to deny to the enemy the valuable water supplies lying in the Wadi at that point. In the meantime, arrangements are being made to construct a branch line of the railway as rapidly as possible from RAFA to the neighbourhood of SHELLAL, to enable me to conduct operations on a broader front that is at present possible from the single railhead at VEXR EL BELAHo6.        Every endeavour is also being made to strengthen the northern portion of my position from the sea to SHARTA, in order to set free as many troops as possible, which will, on release, bo concentrated as a general reserve to moet an enemy threat, against my right flank, or to undertake/offensive
offensive operations, should the situation admit of such a course.7. The scope of my offensive action must, however,for the time being, be governed by the fact that I have at present, exclusive of my mounted troops, only three divisions, fully trained and equipped, with which to carry out operations of this nature.   These divisions, namely 52nd, 53rd and 54th, are, moreover, at present under strength owing to recent casualties and sickness, and in order ts complete them te ?rar establishment I require immediately infantry reinforcements amounting in round, numbers to 350 officers and 9,000 other ranks,   These have been demanded through the normal channels.8. The 74th Division at present consists of threeinfantry brigades, with two Field Companies R.E, recently formed from Army Troops Companies, but is without artillery The re-organisation of these brigades on an infantry basis has only recently been carried out, and a great deal &amp;  steady and systematic training is still required in order te transform the fine material of this yeomanry division into an effective fighting force.The 75th Division exists, at present, merely on paper; only one brigade, namely the 232nd, having as yet been formed.   Of the battalions composing this brigade the l/4th Battalion, Duke of Cornwall&apos;s Light Infantry, on arrival from ADEN, was very carefully nursed in CAIRO for six weeks, and was then despatched to the eastern front for Lines of Communication work at Railhead.   As a result of a few weeks1 of this comparatively light -*ork, the battalion has now been reported by the medical  authorities as unfit for active service (this report I attach, marked &quot;A&quot;), and/I have
5.I have therefore been compelled to withdraw it for rest to EL ARISH.The 2nd Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, which recently arrived from EAST AFRICA, has also a very high sick rate from recurrent malaria, and is far from fit to take part in active operations.Finally, the two Territorial battalions from INDIA which complete the brigade, are still in process of equipment west of the Canal.9. I doubt very much whether any of the units fromINDIA, ADEN or EAST AFRICA will be fit to take the field before the end of the summer.     The units from EAST AFRICA, which have so far arrived in this country, are full of malaria, and are greatly depleted as regards numbers.      The Calcutta Volunteer Battery, for instance, recently arrived with a total strength of only 4 officers and 15 other ranks. 10. In conclusion, whilst I would assure you that it isvery far from my wish, or my intention, to complain, either of the strength or of the composition of the force at my disposal, I feel bound to place the actual situation before you as clearly as possible, in order that there may be no misapprehension on the part of the War Cabinet as regards the causes which have made my rapid advance into PALESTINE, which at one time appeared feasible, now no longer possible, This altered situation is due primarily to the grave concern of the Turks at the threat of an invasion of SYRIA, which has induced them to transfer important reinforcements to this theatre; this they have been enabled to do, owing to the inactivity of the Russians and the failure of the projected spring offensive by the latter in the CAUCASUS.I am also anxious that the Y/ar Cabinet should realise that although, on paper, I may shortly have at my/disposal
disposal a force of five divisions, only three of these (52nd, 53rd and 54th) are at present properly trained and fully equipped for active service in the field. The74th Division, as I have already explained, still lacks considerable training as infantry, and is without artillery of its own, whilst as regards the 75th Division, some months at least must elapse, even after the arrival of all its units in EGYPT, before it can be regarded as an effec-tive fighting formation.In these circumstances, therefore, I am forced to the opinion that my strength is insufficient to justify an attempt on my part to undertake general offensive opera-tions at present, and it is therefore my intention to assume, for the time being, an active defensive, whilst pressing forward my preparations to resume a vigorous offensive as soon as the situation admits of such a course.I have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient servant, (Signed) A. J. MURRAY.General. Commander-in-Chief. Egyptian Expeditionary Force.
I)A&quot;FromM.O., l/4th D.C.L.I,wD.D.M.SBast Force.Sir,With reference to your request over the telephone this morning I have the honour to report as followsi-Within the last 13 aays I have admitted 50 cases td hospital -the majority suffering from Fever N.Y.D., Recurrent attacks of Malaria -and latterly several cases of Heat collapse.      Only two oases of dysentery were among them.Lately, during the recent heat wave, I have had an average daiXy sick-parade of from 40-50 cases, many of whom I had to, detain for 12-24 hours in a tent.The chief point I have noticed about these cases is the lack of resistance compared to farmer years.There seems to be an inability  o fight against exhaustion and the men crumple up under heat or arduous duties in a way that they did not do formerly.    Septic lesion^ also take longer to heal than they should d*; and I find a wound or abrasion, in spite of antiseptic treatment, rapidly becomes septic      Headaches are common when the  , sun is strong. )\Former Health History. \While in INDIA and while at ADEN the health was conspicuously&apos;&apos; good;   but towards the end of our stay at ADEN fever and septic conditions were common.    When we arrived In CAIRO (mid-January) the Battalion was quartered in open-windowed huts and for a time severe colda and bronchial trouble caused a higher admission rate, but towards the end of the month there this greatly diminished and I wrote a more favourable report about them.    There certainly seemed a great increase in the vitality and energy of the men.    Under the more strenuous conditions since the battalion left CAIRO that promise of improved health has not been maintained.The battalion has been unfortunate in not having any or limited transport, so that when on the move, most stores had to be raan handled.I have been with this Battalion since the outbreak of war, many members of it being my patients in private practice, end there-fore I feel I can well note any changes in its general health.We have throughout been remarkably free from diseases of an infective or contagious nature.     The number of venereal oases have been considerably below the average per battalion.Three cases of para-typhoid but none of typhoid have occurred since August 1914.Whilst I cannot say that there is serious disease in the battalion there is undoubtedly a lack of tone and recuperative power &apos; coupled with a good deal of what I can only describe as nervous debility or diminution of will-power.X am,Sir,Your obedient servant,(Sgd)NORMAN P. SALMON.Capt. R.A.M.C, (T) M,0., l/4th D.O.L.I.
