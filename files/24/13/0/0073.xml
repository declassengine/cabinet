6V3&apos; B 0 R ET3WAR CABINET,3OT3EE URGENTLY HP/OTKSD(letter from the Ministry of Munitions to tho Secretary)19 th Key,,5.917Sir,I am directed &quot;by. the Minister of &quot;Munitions to stato, for the information cf tho. War Cabinet, that ho understands that the question of the minimum monthly requiremon-ts cf timber of each Importing Deportment are under consideration by the Director of Timber Supplies.    The letter has? however, suggested that this Department should inform the War Cabinet of any particular consignments that ero urgently required and of tho reasons for so regarding theEu     I am accordingly to state that orders have boeh placed in Canada for 21,535 tons cf caso boards and that 35225 tons of those and 700 tons.of plywood are either on rail or alongside Canadian Poris.     In addition to this the Director of Timber Supplies.&quot;has, on behalf of this Department, purchased in Canada 45^000 tons of spruce dealss the bulk of which is now either on rail or at the docks awaiting shipments     The stocks of ceseboards and plywood, (materials which are required for service ammunition packages), are vory low, and it is essential that all possible supplies should be brought to this country since ammunition cannot be supplied without packages,,     I cm to point out that if tho timber is imported in the form of caseboardc as against rough deals and battens a saving in shipping s^aco of 15 to  0$ is effected.     In order, however, to supplement supplies of casebo&amp;ras it has been necessary to pu^haso&apos;the spruce deals *     At least 5,000 tons per week of the 45,000 tons purchased should bo brought over to this country, since, unless these supplies are received this Department will shortly be placed in an extremely difficult positionI am to add that tho importation of timber largely takes place during the summer months end that, unless a&apos; considerable quantity is imported by the end of October, the position will bo a critical one.Yours,etc.(Sgd.)
