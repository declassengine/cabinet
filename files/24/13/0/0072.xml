2fWar Cabinet.Parcels for Troops in Prance.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.3/General Number/7564.The Army Council recommend to the WarCabinet that it is not necessary to place any restrictions on the despatch of parcels containing breadstuffs to the troops in Prance, or on the-sale of &quot;breadstuffs in canteens in Prance, as the amounts involved are inconsiderable; nor is it advisable, seeing that such a course would be considered harsh and ^ould be unpopular at home.   Moreover, the troops using the canteens in the Lines of Communication areas include Divisions which have been taken out of the firing line for rest, and it is very desirable that such men should get all the food that is possible.DERBY.19th May,- 1917.
