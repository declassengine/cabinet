Arrangements are being made in each county for the holding of a large number of public meetings in the evenings and on Sundays after Church services. Instructors and overseers are interviewing traders in their districts who deal&apos; in spraying requisites to ensure that orders for spraying requisites will be placed at once. The local committees of farmers which have played such an important part in the Spring Tillage Campaign are being utilised to assist in this matter, and also in the matter of securing adequate supplies of harvest requisites and machinery.
