AIR BOARD.Report to the Cabinet.12th May, 1917VI.     The Board have reooived a letter from the Admiralty -notifying   their unwillingness to accept an arrangement proposed by tho Ministry of Munitions by which that Ministry should be the source of supply &amp;f aerial bc&amp;bs for the two Services, the Admiralty being of opinion that all explosives for oonvoyance in H.M. Ships should bo supplied by them.Tho statement of the Board&apos;s functions and relations with other Departments, approved by the Cabinet, provides for the amalgamation of tho supply for the two Services, of aeroplanes, seaplanes, their engines and accessories.     The Board have come to tho conclusion that the term &quot;accesserios&quot;-oannot be held to- ccver aerial bombs and that in those -circumstances tno decision of tho Admiralty is not incon-sistent with tho Cabinet&apos;s decision.II.     The programme of orders and prospective deliveries of engines and aeroplanes for the remainder of the current yoar has, Isow been approved,     The total number of engines expected to be delivered is as follows:-EnginoBMay................... 1014Juno..................   1205JTilv ..................   1361August................    1578Scptembor.............   1796October............... 2140November...............2461December..............   2571llTeTAeroplanes1110 1360 1395 1479 1473 1451 1457 127011004Tho contracts for engines extend in some oases into tho early months of 1918 owing to the nocossity of giving the manufacturer a fair programme f oa? many months ahead, but cancellation clauses are introduced into the extracts wherovor possible.     It is not necessary to plage ardors for aeroplanes so far in advanoe and the output e*f those shown in tho above table does not represent the maximum for tho last months of tho year.     It will be increased by further orderB when now typos of aeroplanes have been decided upon.If it cannot be said that the above pravisitn will iftoet to the full thts requirements in all respects ef the two Services tho extent of tho increase in production will bo approoiatod vrhen it is observed that in December next tho anticipated deliveries of engines will-amount to 2571 as compared with 835 in March of this year and 245 in March of 1916.III.       The development of the 200 horse power engines on which reliance is plaoed for the programme of aeroplane construction for the latter months of the current year,
and to which reference was made in the Reoort to the Cabinet of the 17th February, has given rise to a good deal of anxiety.     The 200 h.&quot;D. 8-cylinder Sunbeam en-gine 1,7as found to contain elements of ---eakness in its dosign and doubts have been suggested in certain quar-ters as.to the expediency of the Board&apos;s decision to adopt it.    It is satisfactory to be able to- state that the difficulties appear nov? to have been overcome-   On the other hand, the 200 hep. Hispano-Suiza engine, with a reduction gear, as manufactured by hessrs., Weiseley. ha3 latterly broken a number of crankshaftsf     Th:.s again points to a defect of design which it is however hoped to remedy.     Meanwhile, as a measure of -insurance, orders have been placed for 400 Hispano-Suiza engines of 150 horse power but of the high compression type, which per-mits a development of about 180 horse power.     Unless the defect in the 200 h.p. engine indicated above can be remedied within a less period, the change over to the 150 h.p. type will involve a delay in production of about 8 weeks.IV.     It is found that the American Government are asking advice as to types of aircraft and aero-engines from various British officers connected with the Air Services now in America.   As there is a danger that the.,, advice given them from these sources may in some cases conflict and as these officers are not always aware of the latest developments of aeronautics the Foreign Office have been asked to suggest that the American Government should send expert,representatives to this Country who could keep in touch with the Air Board and supply the latest information.V.     TheCommittee has follows:-composition of the Civil Aerial Transport now been practically completed and is asLord Korthcliffe,   Chairman. Major J.L.Baird,K,P.

The Committee is somewhat large but in view of the wide scope of the enquiry and the number of interests involved this ^-as thought an advantage as it would permit of the distribution of the work among sub-committees.VI.     The deliveries of engines and aeroplanes have been as follows:-Engines. Aeroplanes.Total for week to 5th Hay................ 199 243.   Total for Aptfil 1917 .... 675 804Total for April 1916 .... 202 202In addition, 12 seaplanes have been delivered to the week ending the 5th May.The strikes and labour unrest are causing grave anxiety and affecting out out.(Signed)   H.
