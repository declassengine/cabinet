COPY.TON fOR TON POLICY - Proposed Declaration.An Inter-Departmental Conference representing the Board of Trade, Foreign Office, Treasury, Admiralty and Ministry of Shipping met at the Board of Trade on April 13th and April 26th to consider the instructions to be given to the British representatives at the Conference of -Hies which at the instance of the irench Government it is proposed to summon to consider the suggested declaration on the subject of what is known as the &quot;Ton for Ton Policy11.The question arose in the following circumstancesIn a memorandum of the 27th October, 1916, dealing with the Economic Desiderata in the terms of Peace, the Board of Trade had suggested that if the allies were in a position to do so they should insist on a surrender of enemy shipping at least equivalent in tonnage value and general character to the whole of the allied ships sunk or destroyed as a result of belligerent action, sIt appeared, however, to the Board of Trade that any scheme of taking possession of enemy ships, whether in pursuance of the above recommendation or as part of an indemnity, might be frustrated unless precautions were taken in advance against the colourable transfer of enemy vessels to neutral flags.   They accordingly suggested to the foreign Office the desirability of the Allies safeguarding the position by making a joint declaration to the effect that: (l) they accept the principle that enemy merchant ships are liable for claims in respect of merchant ships destroyed by enemy action; and (2) they will recognise no transfer of an enemy ship to aneutralx See Annex I
neutral flag which takes place before the final conclusion of peace and is effected without their consent.The allied Governments were asked if they would agree to a declaration on those lines and in reply dated February 2nd the French Governnent while accepting the principle of a declaration, suggested that it would be desirable for certain matters to be discussed at an Inter-Allied Conference before any such declaration was made..  The French Government also raised a number of detailed points that would require to be settled in connection with the proposed policy.   Accordingly the Foreign Office sugyjested to the Board of Trade that they should call an Inter-Departmental Conference for the purpose indicated above.The Inter-Denartmental Conference have now to renort as follows(i) As regards policy, we a^ree with the general proposal for exacting compensation in kind for the destruction of Allied ships by enemy action.   In the original. Board of Trade memorandum it ;:as suggested that no attempt shoulc be made to discriminate, between vessels illegally destroyed and others, as such an attempt would lead to endless controversies.   The passage in the Board of Trade memorandum is a-r follows:-&quot;It will be observed that it is not suggested that any attempt should be made to discriminate between vessels illegally destr03/00 and others.    Such an attempt would lead to endless controversies, and it is submitted that this dis-crimination is unnecessary.   Although the ground for requiring the surrender of any enemy ships is the illegal practices to which our enemies have systematically resorted, it is a perfectly fair retribution for those practices that they should entail the payment of compensation in kino for all vessels destroyed,, whether by fair means or foul&quot;,7e
We &apos;agree in principle with the view hero expressed, hut we would point out that since last autumn the position has changed inasmuch as we are informed that by the end of the war the tonnage of merchant ships sunk illegally is likely to amount to practically the whole of the available German mer-cantile marine.   Je therefore think that there would be no practical loss, and some gain, from the point of view of neutral opinion, if the policy were confined to reparation for illegal sinkings only, provided always that the decision as to what sinkings were illegal should rest with the lilies. This proviso is absolutely essential as proceedings before a tribunal to establish whether or not each case of sinking was illegal might easily be protracted over the i!transitional period1&apos; and lose for us tho whole value of the proposed policy.The limitation of any declaration in this manner would not0 of course, prejudice the right of the allies to demand the cession of further enemy shipping (if such exists at the end of the war) as part of an indemnity.(2) Passing from the question of the policy to be pursued to that of a public declaration giving warning of that policy, it is our duty to point out that if the declaration should be defied in any-particular case it would be difficult after the end of the war to put the implied threat into force, as to do so would mean the confiscation in time of peace of a vessel flying a neutral flag.   This would probably- cause friction with neutrals and might lead to reprisals against British ships subsequently entering the neutral port..       It is a matter for the r/ar Cabinet to decide so far as this country is concerned whether this risk should be taken relying on the preventive value of the warning but realising that in the last event we might not be able to enforce it, or whether we should face the alternative risk of finding that the enemy ships had escapedusO)
us by being transferred t-- neutral flags when we wished to obtain them by way of indemnity or compensation.Whichever of these alternatives is adopted it is very de-sirable that the Allies should agree to adopt a common policy, and, if it is decided to issue a declaration, that they should definitely agree to enforce the threat embodied in the declara-tion, or should realise that they will not be able to enforce it.We do not feel competent to decide as a question of principle between the two alternative courses indicated above, but we think that in practice any risk might be minimised if, the proposed declaration were carefully drafted, and held ready for issue only if and when there is any sign that the Germans are endeavouring to transfer their tonnage to neutral flags with a  view to avoiding   the consequences of defeat. There is of course some small danger of transfers being effect-ed without our knowledge, but we are advised that this chr. cr is probably not very great.We therefore recommend that the proposed declaration should be drafted forthwith but should not be issued at once, but kept in reserve, and issue1 promptly, if and when the necessity arises.In the event of hostilities coming to an end without any occasion having already arisen for the issue of the proposed declaration, we regard it as of the highest importance that it should be a condition of any armistice that during the whole period of peace negotiations, which may last over many weeks, no transfer of enemy ships should be effected without the express consent of the Allies, and we think that this condi-tion should simultaneously be notified to neutral Governments. A  draft article for this purpose is appended (Annex III),
Though it is beyond our province we venture to urge the .. desirability of considering whether any provision of this sort in the armistice should not be extended to cover the alienation of securities and other assets, the surrender--of * which might be required for indemnity purposes,(3) Assuming that the above roc^nen&amp;ations are approved we have next to consider the question of the attitude to be taken up by H.M* GoTernment towards the French, proposal for a preliminary Conference of the Allies, and the instructions to be given to the British delegates at any such Conference, supposing one to be held. -We may say    at the outset that after careful  considers-tion we feel considerable doubt as to the expedionoy of summon ing any such conference at an early date.   17e feel that it would bo essential that all the Allies possessing maritime in-terests should be invited to take part, including of course the United States.   It would be practically impossible to con-fine such a Conference to the single question of the terms of the proposed public declaration, and-many ouastions would be likely to be raised-, including th-e-tjuestion of distribution of tonnage among the Allies after the war, which might prove highly -controversial.   The only possible basis of distribu-tion is in our opinion the losses sustained by each of the Allies by illegal enemy action, but this basis wouldjprobablv only meet with acceptance by our Allies if the question of reparation for destruction of shipping were closely associa-ted with that of reparation fer the devastation of territory Thus the whole question of indemnities in kind and in cash would not improbably be raised, and we are not sure if H.M. Government is ready as yet to discuss these questions with the Allies.
For these reasons we are disposed to think that unless H3..Government feel hound by their arrangement with the French tc proceed to call a Conference it would be much better to ccrry on the negotiations with regard to a declaration by means of correspondence.In this connection we would point out that if our recommen-dations are accepted, the urgency for settling the terms of a declaration at once is considerably diminished and it would probably be safe to defer any Conference; until there is some sign that Germany is proposing to transfer ships to other flags..We therefore recommend that an official letter be sent to the French Government replying to each of the points raised in their last despatch, submitting a draft declaration for their criticism and suggesting that any Conference of Allies on the subject should be deferred until there is some sign that the Germans are proposing tc transfer their ships to other flags.(4) As regards the specific points raised by the FrenchGovernment we recommend that the attitude of H ,11. Governmentshould be as follows: (The French points are underlined).(i)    Whether the acquisition of enemy ships in neutral - sorts by or on behalf of the Allied Governments, would affect the declaration, and^etherjhis acquisition should De ,p,ro.ce,eaed, with.There is no inconsistency between the declaration and the acquisition of enemy ships by the Allies,   On the other hand the declaration would rather aesist the Allied Governments in acquiring tonnage before the war ends, as by making it clear that the Allies intend if they can to exact reparation for vessels destroyed by the enemy, it would tend to make the enemy, desire to obtain some return for the chips instead of having them confiscated when peace comes, I(6! I
(ii) The phrase. &quot;cession of enemy merchant shipping Jo replace the merchant ships destroyed by enemy action&quot; should be de-fined with particular reference to (a)&quot; cargoes: (bj neutral losses; (cjoonfiscat-ecLyejssels,., and should a distihction&quot;be jiaade betweenyessels destroyed arter regular&quot; capture or as the&quot;r&quot;esult of action contraryto mFernationaTFlaw.(a) As this is a proposal for the replacement of destroy--ed property in kind it has no bearing on cargoes * which are    &apos;&apos; not susceptible of such replacement and could only be dealt with by means of a monetary compensation,-(b) It is doubtful whether there will be sufficient G-erman ships to compensate the Allies for all their los^c^, and neutrals might not resist the German submarines to such a Treat extent if they knew they were going to be compensates for any loss by the Allies. Keutral losses should therefore be exclud-ed from any declaration, and the reparation to be mads therefor if anv, should be provided for otherwise in the terms of nedce,(c) This point has already been discussed above.   As it is probable that the losses due to illegal enemy action may equal or exceed the total amount of enemy tonnage availableit would probably be more satisfactory and would create a bette;impression among neutrals if the declaration were confined tovessels which had been sunk as the result of action consideredby the Allies to be contrary to international law.   It is ofessential importance, however, that the ships should be sur-rendeied immediately at the conclusion of hostilities, and itis therefore essential that the decision as to which shipshave been illegally sunk should rest with the Allies,(iii) ?-hat is to be the basis on which com-pensation is to be effected?So far as possible the ships lost should be replaced by vessels of similar tonnage value and general character. The draft Article recommended by the Board of Trade with the mcdifi-catioa suggested in the words underlined would seem suitable for the purpose. (See Annex II) , ;s
(iv) flhafc nf^pensfltion is to be exacted in caseswhara TTiflnrs.nnft. money has been paid On VQSSOls,destroyed?The question whether insurance money has been paid or not does not affect the question.(v) Should thfl nnarr/ tonnage be ceded to the jjadisidlia] or to the Government concerned^The tonnage should be ceded to the Government concerned and not to the individual shipowners who have already for the most Dart been reimbursed for the loss by insurance the cost of which they have added to their freight charges.(vi) Arrangements should be made for ensuring thatqfidfKLYftsriflls remain ,under..aa ,Allied,, flag.The ships would become the property of the Government and would gradually be sold over a period of time, and it could easily be arranged that the ships should be retained under an Allied flag by having a bond to ensure that this should be done as in the case of the ships sold by order of the prize court.(5) .&apos;.e have mentioned above that the right basis of allocation of the ceded tonnage among the  Hies is the pro-portionate losses of each Ally by illegal destruction of its vessels.There is also the question whether the ships detained in Allied ports at the outbreak of war should be put into the pool with the ot er enemy vessels, or held by the country in whose ports they be.   Unless the Americans condemn their detained ships in the prise court, this question is in practice largely an American question.    Obviously, if the German ships in -jnerican ports are not condemned as prize it would be to our advantage to pool the whole of the ships so as to get for ourselves a proportion of this tonnage.    If, on the other hand, these ships are condemned they would become the property of the United States and would be ex-eluded from the tonnage available for distribution.    As(8)
the tonnage detained by this country is approximately the same as that detained by the Allies, and the British losses amount to about three times those of the lilies, it would be somewhat to our advantage to pool the ships even if the ships in American ports are condemned.   In any case the actual ships detained by any JLly would probably form part of its quota.   ./e think, therefore, that if the point is raised A.l.Government should take the view that all detained ships should form part of the pool for purposes of allocation in proportion., to Illegal sinkings.H.

AHNKX I.Ertrac-t from.Board of Trade Memorandum of October 27th, 1916.ifhile it would be unduly oppressive to seize the whole of the means of maritime transport of the Central Powers it would be in accordance with retributive Justice to insist on a&quot;surrender of shipping at least equivalent in tonnage value and general character to the 7;hole of the Allied ships sunk or destroyed as the result of belligerent action.   Up to the present this would give the Allies about z\ niillijon tons of shipping x, and by the end of the war the total will doubt-less have grown to a larger total.   A draft provision for the purpose is attached for consideration (Annex H.A.),   There should be no insuperable difficulty in allotting this shipping among the Allies, and it is essential that the British share should not be handed over to the owners of the lost ships (who have or mi$it have received the equivalent in insurance money), but retained for the time on the hands of the State and chartered to -British shipowners, the ships gradually sold to British^owners over a period of time.It will be observed that it   is not suggested that any attempt should be made to discriminate between vessels il-legally destroyed and others.   Such an attempt would lead to endless controversies, and it is submitted that this aLiscrimijia-tion is unnecessary.Although the ground for requiring the surrender of any enemy ships is the illegal practices to which our enemeies have systematically resorted, it is a perfectly fair retribution for these practices that fey sbsaid entail the payment of compensation in kind for all vessels destroyed, whether by fair means or foul&quot;.s Now increased to 3g- millions (January 1917).(10)
