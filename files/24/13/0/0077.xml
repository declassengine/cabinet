G.T. 776.The Secretary, Y/ar Cabinet.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and I would like the attached papers on the reduction of forces at Salonioa and other matter discussed at the rocent Conference in Paris brought to the notioe of the war Cabinet at the earliest possible moment.(Signed)   J.      .7SLLICOE.13th Hay. 1917.HBttOSAffPUM it THE ?I^3T S3&amp; LORE.I desire to direct the attention of the War Cabinet te the urgent necessity of informing the French Government that we have no intention of abandoning our proposals for the immediate reduction of the force at Salonioe,   In the reply Of the French Government, dated the 11th instant, te the Memorandum left with the French War Cabinet at tho  aria Conference, the difficulties of the shipping position, which are the fundamental basis of our proposals for reduction of the $alonica force, are entirely ignored, and the whole question ie aide-tracked by bringing inte $rominenoe the Military and political difficulties that will follow reduction or withdrawal.    The War Cabinet, in arriving at these conclusions, was, of course-, fully aware of theso difficulties; and nothing but absolute necessity would; hate forced the Cabinet into making the proposals.   To start again ai the beginning, and to discuss once more the results that would follow reduction or withdrawal, is simply to work round in a oirela; and, seeing that the recent alilht decrease in shipping losses, even if continued, will not make it possible to maintain the line of communication to Salonioa or te guard it efficiently, 1 urge the, Cabinet to inforA the French Government that it la necessary that a decision should be reached bot;, later than the 1st of June as to whether the next group of troops to be. withdrawn shall come from the British or the French army* and that, 11 by that date the French Government has      &apos;fount-tied Its intention of withdrawing a division, as soon as the first withdrawal of British troops has been oompleted an arrangement will at once bo made to Withdraw a second British division as scon as the shipping utilised ih the first withdrawal is available.   Had I Seen the repl  of the British Government to the Ffanoh Goverhmeht before its despatch, I would have suggested making an answer in the abdve sense.(Signed)   J. H. JELLICOK.13th kav. 1917.
II.MBMOEMDUM BY THE CHIEF OP^THE 31   IMPERIAL GBin$?M STAFFiI agree with the views and proposals of the Chief of the Naval Staff and have already told the lYar Cabinet that I consider the French communication to bo most unsatisfactory.Para. 1 of the resolutions tabled;by the Prime Minister distinctly embodied the &quot;principle&quot; of reducing the troops to a number sufficient to hold Salonika, whereas the French reply leaves the question still open, although the British and French Naval Authorities agreed at tho Conference that the Force may be starved if not withdrawn, while the British and French Military Authorities agreed that no military object is served by holding Salonika.   The only question left open by the Prime Minister was the method of withdrawal.The difficulties of withdrawing, or even of reducing, the Force are fully realised, and they arc by no means solely political.   There are also grave naval and military difficulties and dangers.     But they must be faced, or wo may incur a great disaster.   Vve can only do ou  best to minimise the consequences of an enterprise which&apos;has been thoroughly unsound from the commencement.i I wish to add that had I seen our reply of the12th instant before despatch I would have proposed drawing attention also to tho omission of any reference to the final1&apos;resolution in regard to the western Frcnt.   I think the ^mission may not be without significance.(Signed) . W. R. ROBIjRToCN-18th May, 1917.
