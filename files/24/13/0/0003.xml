1 ySFOPI1* G.T.7.03 UAR CAXIITFT.POLICY IIT VIEF OA.B:USSIM.j;^LpP^ITS (Memorandum by Lord Gurson).She probable Military and Naval consequence of the with-drawal of Russia from the Entente have been dealt with in papers by Sir W,Re Robertson and Sir JYJelllooe.     There is no theatre of T7ar in which the effect would not be great and damaging. Large-numbers of German Divisions would, be released (some indeed have already been moved) for the Western Front or elsewhere, and of Austrian Divisions for the Italian front or elsewhere.     The Turkish Army, freed from anxieties in the Caucasus and Armenia, would concentrate its energies upon Mesopotamia and Palestine. Roumania, compelled to make Peace, would disappear from the Entente.      So reason would remain, short of an Allied advance in the Balkans, which there seems no reason to anticipate, and which the projected retirement from Salonika will render impossible, why Bulgaria should come to terms.     On the contrary the Bulgarian forces from the Roumanian frontier must precipi-tate the withdrawal of the Allies from Salonika.     Thus in every field of war the situation would be sensibly altered for the worse.     The repercussion would be felt as far as Persia in the East, and Arabia in the South.The IT aval consequences would be no less disguieting. The Baltic would pass under the complete control of the Germans (with the possible loss of the British vessels and submarines there interned).     The Turkish Fleet would be free from molestation in the Black Sea and might even make an appearance in the Mediterranean.     On the other hand the British Shipping now employed on the White Bea route would be liberated for use elsewhere.
Page 2The Economic consequences of Russian secession would in the long run be very formidable.     The depletion of rolling stock (both German and Russian) apart from the difference of gauge between the two systems, the demands of Russiarfh-rself for food supplies, and the doubt whether Russia oould at the present moment supply the resources of which Germany stands in the greatest need for the prosecution of the far, e.g. sulphur, oils arui fats - might postpone for a timo the full effect of the change.   But in the long run the Allied blockade would be doomed to failure.The moral effect would be serious and far-reaching. The above conclusions appear to have been established by the examination that haB taken place.   Before, however, basing any new or modified policy upon their acceptance, it seems desirable to enquire whether or not the present position in Russia renders her secession an inevitable or even a probable contingency.     The general trend of the recent telegrams is unquestionably unsatisfactory and depressing.   Discipline in both the Army and Navy appears to have been relaxed to a point   which will render recovery very difficult.     It is doubtful whether a German offensive or invasion would rally the forces which have been thus demoralised and undermined.     It is still more doubtful whether this particular spur is likely to be applied, since the evidence is accumulating oft an understanding between the German and Russian troops, suggesting the continuance of a nominal war, but a war without serious fighting - a reductio ad absurdum -which could only lead to an eventual peace.     The industrial anarchy in Russia which has closed so many of her workshops and dangerously reduced the output of the remainder, is another source of weakness from tfhich recovery is hardly to be expected.   Mean-while the Pacificist tendencies of the Extreme party, who seem already to have won a distinct advantage in their struggle with the Moderates and the Government, fomented as they will be/
by German propaganda and German bribes, must lend an immense impetus to the Peace movement, already inaugurated by the pro-paganda of &quot;No Annexation&apos;&apos;.    It may be remarked-in. passing that it is very easy to engage not to annex what you have not already won and have no chance of winning - and that; it will be necessary to bear very closely in mind in the approaching months the sharp distinction between the abandonment of impos-sibie territorial ambitions, and the surrender of territories already in military occupation,    The two propositions are en-tirely different; and no single formula can cover both,Adm.itting the discouraging nature and augury of the symptoms above described, it is still open to doubt whether :Russia will actually disappear from the War at an early date in the sense&apos;of either concluding or attempting to conclude a separate peace,,   Even a Socialist Government might shrink from a course so humiliating to the national pride, and so injur-ious to the future position of Russia among the nations. More-over, the problem of Poland, for which-the-Russian Socialists are bound to seek a solution on. the lines of a re-united and independent State, would at once bring thorn into conflict with, tire German -peace-makers., whose Poland of the future would certainly include the Russian Border Provinces that formed &apos; part of the old Kingdom of Poland, even after the first -partition.   Upon this rock alone peace negotiations might /very easily split,It is thus possible that not only in the event of the pre-sent Russian Government holding its own, but&apos; even of its being replaced by a more advanced successor-, we may have the spectacle of an ally, not actually throwing over the --Alliance, or cpn-cluding a separate peace,-but remaining for a&quot;.time both in the \rar and yet outside of it.    Such a situation &quot;could not bo of very prolonged duration, since, it might be rudely interrupted eririsr by German invasion o..*-* e..,*.or
pare 4or-:by ail internal revolution in Russia., or by the emeivgence ef some form ef military despotism.;    or it mightdisappear under the influence ;cf a successful Socialistmovement for peace armng the other belligerent countries,of cf the abridgment of the war by narked success  .on the partof-one or the other of the combatant groups.   As long, ho?;-ever., as such a situation, viz: of war without fighting, con-tinued, it would become a matter for serious considerationhow far it would be worth while for us to continue to assist Russia either in respect of munitions or finance..In the face of this very complex and ever- changing position, it seems desirable- to consider what our own policy should be.   At a Conference held at the Foreign Office to-day (May 12th) at -which Lord Robert Cecil and Lord Hardinge attended, and at which we were assisted by Sir Maurice Hankey and Captain Amery, we passed successively in review the present position and probable attitude of all the Powers or States whom it might be attempted to detach from the war, in sequel either t* the conclusion of a separate peace by Russia or of the paralysis cf Russia1s military strength,    These are:-Austria, Turkey and Bulgaria.    In none of these cases could we discover any sufficient reason why they should sever them-selves from an alliance which has already proved to be 8% successful, in so far as its main objects In Eastern and Central Europe are concerned, and from which they aremore likely to derive advantage in the future, even at ofthe expense/German domination, than from anything -which we are at present in a position to--effer them.Neither eruld we see any likelihood.of an early arrange-ment between Austria and Italy, leading to a-separate peace between those countries.!       Italy would not make peace withoutsubstantial
page 5substantial concession from Austria.   Austria (all the more if she be freed from anxieties on nor Eastern frontier by the inaction or the withdrawal of Russia) is in a position to refuse, and would not be allowed by Germany, to make them.   Italy may not be a very conforb-able or helpful   bedfellow in the Entente^ - But she night also be a rather disagreeable and even dangerous factor if she went out. Anyhow for the present it seems to be necessary for her to continue fighting, unless the coal difficuly or internal trouble bring her to an abrupt standstill.     In the meantimey she continues to hold 750,000 Austrian troops* a certain proportion of vlyich would in all probability be successfully claimed by Germany for the Western Front if they were released from the Italian campaignAs to^  ihirkey there appears to be no reason.why she should wish to conclude a separate peace at the present stage.   She now knows that she will retain Constantinople, without in all probability having to pay any price for it.   Ivo argument would prevail but the restoration by ourselves of Mesopotamia, or at least of Baghdad, which,.we -are not prepared to consider.   Her Government is in the hands of a powerful triumvirate, whasohold, so far from being shakenhas on the whole been strengthened by the War-.   The Entente has at present nothing in the way of inducement to offer her,. Ju^st as we are fighting in the west to reduce the military strength of Germany to a point at which she would be prepared to consider peace on reasonable terms, so must we continue to fight Turkey in the East if we do wire to bring her to a similar state of mind.. This is a strong argument for the Palestine policy, to which I will presently turn.On
page 6Onthe other hand      if fair to hear in mind that the removal of the Russian pressure, which was the real cause of the creation of the Middle Europe block, will at once diminish the effort which lliddle Europe finds it either necessary or possible to pur forth.   Austria Bulgaria and  mrkey are all nearing the brink ox exhaustion, and as soon as the present menaco from&apos; Russia disappears Germany will not be able to pet more than a moderate degree of military exertion out of any of them for the remainder of the war.   Pur $her, Largo cpiaiititios of guns and munitions which are now being furnished to Russia, will become available for the use of the Allies,It would appear therefore that British policy should for the moment proceed upon the following basis,(I will come later to future developments)(i) While the moment seems to be singularly unfavourable for peace negotiations initiated by ourselves, there is no reason why the movements of the Honsdorff type on the part of any of the Central Powers should bo discouraged, if they are renewed. lie have hitherto shown ourselves willing to listen privately to any such overtures,    hep- have failed hitherto, because of German pressure and of the ovei-weemiauv confidence reposed by the Enemy in the success of his submarine campaign.   Put as time goes on they are likely to be resumed.(ii)  Every effort should be made without delay to strengthen the hands of the moderate party in Russia, and to deter the extremists, should they gain the upper hand, from committing their country to a separate peace with the Central Powers,   A well chosen deputation of Labour Leaders to Russia (even if Mr Henderson as, decided bv the War Cabinet cannot accompany them) may do something to keeri tbeRussian
Russian socialist party on the rails.(lii)   But even greater importance is to he attached to the proposal of the national Executive of the British Labour Party, already publicly announced to summon a Conference of the Labour and Socialist,  parties of all the Allied countries, including U.S.A. to be held in London about the middle of June.   I look to such a conference not merely to counter the gathering about to take place at Stockholm (from which representatives.of Great Britain Franco and U.S.A. will be absent) but also to diminish the danger sf the suggested International Socialist Conference in a neutral country, for which the Pus si an 7/orkman and SoldiersJ Committee are about to issue invitations, and which may even be guided into safe channels by concerted action in advance of the Pro-war Socialists Parties in the Allied countries,.   It would be pointed out by the latter that a separate Paissian peace must entail the domination of German Militarism over the rest of xborope,   ri&apos;he &quot;No annexation&quot; cry must be replaced by a recognition of the principle that the basis of territorial re-settlement should be the wishes of the inhabitants of the regions concerned,   ir&apos;.e Prussian Socialists might be committed to the creation of an indepcuent Poland - to include G-lacia and Poson - which would effectually precrent the conclusion of any agreement with the one my,(iv)   It is becoming increasingly clear that the attainment of the lull terms of the Allies answer to President tfilson in January is not likely to be realised; and that a modification ox claims on the part of certain of theAllied,
Page 8.Allied Powers and even an abandonment of them on the part of others, will he inevitable,   The interpretation of an inexorable adherence to a programme not merely of victory, but of conquest (involving the complete dis-ruption of the Central Empires)    to which the reply of the /Entente Powers appeared to lend itself, has undoubtedly been a powerful factor in maintaining the alliance and stiffening the resolve of the Central group.   A time may arrive in the near future when a less rigid and literal interpretation of this document may be invited from, or be forced upon, the illlied nations 0    It may be. difficult, and even impossible, at this stage, for Great Britain to make any suggestion of this character to her Allies - all the more so that the territorial sacrifices entailed will have in the main to be made by them, and not by heru    ( The British sacrifices will more probably have to take a pecuniary form by the remission of debts).    But it is ef the utmost importance that we should make up our own minds as to the form which the modified programme should assume in the interests both of European peace and of our own future safety.   Accordingly I suggest that a Committee, presided over by a Cabinet Minister,, should without delay, be appointed to explore this aspect of the case, and to advise the Government as to the line to be taken as soon as peace prcposals assume a serious form.   The next step would probably be a private consultation with Prance   - a course that would bo attended with less risk than in any other case,  since the bulk of French demands are demands upon which we must ourselves insist.     Indeed, as the war proceeds, if it is to last much longer,  it would seem that the Inter-dependence
Page 9dependence and alliance of France and Great Britain must grow stronger rather than weaker, since neither1 can leave the war without the other, nor can either attain her aims without the aid of the other.   It is even possible to contemplate a case when, say in a year from now, these two countries with America, may he left along In the war, with an enemy perhaps himself reduced, and that this combination may be fated to finish the campaign.It is not necessary in this paper to determine the modifi-cation of claims as affecting Italy, Serbia, Roumania and Yenizelist Greece, which it may be desirable to adopt.   That would be a Question for the suggested Committee.   Neither i%v this the place to discuss the re-orientation of our own Asiatic policy which may be forced upon us by the possible survival, after the war, of the Mid-European block.But it is clear that in such a ease, unless Palestine can be secured, the position of Great Britain in the Near East will become one of extreme danger.,;   A Teutoaised Turkey, left in possession of Asia Minor (for probably few of us believe that the fanciful schemes of partition of that region which have occupied the attention of the Allied diplomats for the past two years are in the least likely to fructify) and of Syria and Palestine even if the British remained, in occupation of Mesopotamia, would involve a perpetual menace to Egypt, the disappearance of the Arab Kingdom of the Hedjaz, and the gra^-e peril to the British position at Baghdad.   If Russia went out of the war in the course of the summer, the danger in Palestine would be come one of immediate urgency, since but little time would be left to defeat the Turkish
Page 10,army new in Palestine, before it was powerfully reinforced, and the last chance of coming to terms with Turkey on con-clitions favourable to ourselves, would have disappeared.Although the political considerations in favour of the Palestine Expedition, as set forth above, are of the first importance, it will be noticed that both Sir Jt  Jellicoe and Sir W. Robertson are, in existing conditions, opposed to any large offensive operations in this region.  The former1s objections are based entirely upon shipping considerations, aiid he shows that from this point of view the only ameliora-tion of the situation by the transfer of troops from Salonika go Palestine would be that a portion of the shipping required for its maintenance would be transferred from the ilediisrranean .to the Indian Ocean where, though still exposed to the possibility of attach by raiders, they would have nothing to fear from submarines.    The Chief of the Imperial General Staffs objections are based partly upon shipping, partly on the fact that the military impotence of Russia in the Caucasus enables the Turks to oppose us In far 0reater strength in Paleswine than was originally estimated, and partly on the wider consideration that the troops released from Salonica are required as a reserve on the Western B&apos;ront,    The necessity for the creation of such a reserve has more than once been impressed on the !-?ar Cabinet by General Smuts.The Cabinet must arrive at an early decision on this question, and in doing so climatic considerations must be borne in.mind.    If General hurray had succeeded in inflict-ing a decisive defeat on the lurks at Gaza his troops would, within a short time, have been operating in the hill, country of Palestine.   Any offensive operations inifciated at thepresent
W. -.- ---&quot;^Tlfff&quot;HIIWIIIBIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII      lPage. 11 .Present moment, however, would in the most favourable circum-stances/have to be &apos;carried out for a time in the coast region, particularly if the coastal route to Jerusalem is followed, and precise information appears to be required as to whether the climate is such that British troops could be expected to operate successfully in this region before the autumn.The Palestine question is in the main one for military decisiono    If by converting it into an important secondary, theatre of war we can (a) obtain possession of Jerusalem at an early date , and then (b) either drive the Turks out cf Syria, or at any rate advance to a strong defensive position in the northern part of Palestine, from which we could not be expelled while the war lasts -   the campaign may be worthy of considerable sacrifices.    If this is beyond cur strength, -we may have to remain where we are, or conceivably to retreat.       sgould view &quot;with great apprehension a third serious discomfiture at the hands-&apos; of the Turks ( such as a retreat of this nature weald involve) - a reverse from which in this case there would be no time for recovery.As regards the Western Pr:r.t3 we may concur with the Chief i,i the Imperial General Staff in trusting that- while the military position there would be made more difficult by the defection cf huesla, it is nevertheless one to which the Allies can look forward with.reasonable confidence, provided no untoward circumstances occur, their object being to carry .nn as effective a campaign as circumstances will permit until the inbervenLion of an American Army may enable the Allies to assort a definite superiority.    By no other means does it appear likely tnat the complete liberationof
(Intd,).   G. of Ehcf Belgium, arid the evacuation of France, will, if the war continues as long^ he secured.    For, if these two objects were made the subject of an offer by Germany at an earlier date-, while her military strength and that of her Allies is still unbroken, it could only be at the price of conditions which Great Britain alone would have to pay and which would purchase the safety of our Allies by the acceptance of a grave peril to the future of the British Empire.
