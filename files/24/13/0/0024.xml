From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,lOth May mi.(Repeated to Sir P. Cox, Basra.)[P1854] Your telegram of 27th April. Mesopotamia administration. Your despatch will be awaited, but His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to assure you at once that they do not contemplate immediate establishment of an Arab administration on principles indicated in my telegram of 29th March. They fully realise that military situation requires that Army Commander and Chief Political Officer should have free hand, but what they are concerned about is that nothing that can be avoided should be done during military occupation that would prejudice subsequent introduction of above-mentioned principles, and in particular establishment of separate adininis-trative systems for Basra and Baghdad. Subject to clear understanding on this point, Cox may carry on in consultation with Army Commander as heretofore, until whole problem has been examined and reported on by a Commission as he suggests. Such questions as administrative councils, permanent judicial system, regulation of Indian immigration, &amp;c, are reserved for consideration of Commission. Meanwhile only such minimum of administrative efficiency should be aimed at as is necessary to preserve order and meet needs of occupying force. Amendment of laws and intro-duction of reforms should be kept within narrowest possible limits. Personnel both of higher branches and clerical establishment should be limited to immediate requirements, and should not ordinarily be drawn from India unless and until it has been ascertained that Egypt and Soudan cannot supply them.His Majesty&apos;s Government accept Cox&apos;s views regarding Holy Places which coincide with their own. As regards irrigation schemes they entirely concur in last sentence of your paragraph 8. Question of Persia must stand over till situation is clearer. Same applies to military arrangements after war.   Present arrangements will be maintained in meantime.
