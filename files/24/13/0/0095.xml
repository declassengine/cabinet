CONFIDENTIAL. G.T. 793WAR   CABINET.INTELLIGENCE BUREAU.Department of Information.B. 2.Special Memorandum on the Slav Socialists In Austria-Hungary.In view of the Stockholm Conference the Central Powers are marshalling their various Socialists.     In Austria-Hungary Count Czernin!s support of the German-Socialists leaders, Adler, Renner, and Seitz was still more marked than the tacit understanding between Scheidemann and the German Chancellor. Meanwhile in Hungary Count Tisza suddenly remembered and brought into prominence the insignificant Socialist leaders Garami and Woltner who (though their party has been responsible for a very able and fearless daily newspaper Nepszava) have never played any serious part in Hungarian politics.     King Ferdinand also sent his well drilled Socialists from Bulgaria.To complete the picture, representatives of the Slav Socialists from Austria-Hungary were needed.     It was not suf-ficient that Mr. Daszinski the well-known Polish Socialist leader should go to Stockholm:   for the Poles always have followed a lonely furrow and are more disposed than ever to do so.    There was no hope of winning over the Szech Socialists, so long as their leader, Mr. Soukup, remains in prison on a charge&quot;of high treason (owing to his Solidarito with the views of Kramarz, Masaryk, Klofac, Choc and all other party leaders on the war).     There thus remained only the Jugoslavs.    The Italians were of course ruled out, owing to the fate of Cesare Battisti the Socialist &quot;martyr&quot; of Irredentism) In their case there was the great practical difficulty that the Jugoslav provinces being overwhelmingly agrarian, with a very small industrial population, Socialism is virtually nonexistent.     In Dalmatia, Istria and Carniola, or a basis on Universal Suffrage, no
Slovene or Croat Socialist has been elected to the Reichsrat. In Croatia, out of 88 members in the Diet, the Socialists have never secured more than two.     In Bosnia there may be a couple of thousand workmen in Sarejevo who are Socialists in sentiment but not more.The only serious organ of the Jugoslav Socialists was Slobodna Rijec, at Zagr6b (Agram), which was suppressed during the first weeks of the war, its editor Mr. Dimitri jevoc&quot; being imprisoned.As no one else could be secured, two entirely obscure individuals in Sarajevo, named Glumac and Kapor, who have never played any part even in the local politics of the town, have been sent by the Bosnian Landesregierung, with a certain fanfare of trumpets to represent the Jugoslav.The Jugoslav Committee in London,, has not unnaturally sent a telegram of protest exposing this transparent manoeuvre to the Committee of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers1 Delegates in Petrograd.
