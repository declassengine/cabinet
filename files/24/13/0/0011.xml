1]SMS C g E T. G.T. 711.WAR CABINET.3HIPPIHG   STHATBGY   IN   THE   ATLAUTIG.Further Memo, by Sir Leo Ohiozza Money, M.P. Previous&quot;&apos;papers G.T. 660, 69T&quot;&amp; 698](1)       The practical working out of the scheme which i have submitted for the concentration of shipping in the Atlantic involves the following main points of administra-tion:-(2)       THE PURCHASE OE SUP &quot;LIES III AMERICA(a) Each purchasing department to be immediately instructed to procure its further supplies from the United States and Canada and to limit its commitments in other markets to the lowest possible level.(b) A machinery already exists for the co-ordination of departmental requirements in the Tonnage Priority Committee, of which I cm Chairman, and this body could efficiently perform the function of concentrating demand upon America.     Practical difficulties could be discussed and settled and questions of substitution disposed of,(c) Either the Tonnage Priority Committee or the Board of Trade could see to i$ that private demand for commodities is directed into the proper channel.     Private demand, however, has now reached a very low level.     The facts are that the&apos;Tonnage Priority Committee has allocated 92^ of the available tonnage to the requirements of (a) the- Food Controller j (b) the War Office, &quot;(c) the Admiralty, (d) the Timber Controller, and (c) the Minister of Munitions.(3)       ACTION IN AID BY AMERICA.The co-operation of the American Government is essential.   The presence of Mr.Balfour in America enables us to broach the scheme immedlately.     The President of the Board of Trade, Sir Albert Stanley, is intimately acquainted, with business conditions on both sides of the Atlantic end if he would undertako the task of going $o America to ensure that we obtained our supplies, the scheme would be safeguarded on its American side.(4) The commercial interest of America runs with theScheme and there is no reason to apprehend that there would be any difficulty in that respect.     It is, however; important that the American Government should see to it that the big domestic demand in America for steel, etc is not allowed to swamp war demand.
(5) It would be necessary to re-organise North AmericanAtlantic ports, arranging for day and night shifts, improved railway facilities, etc.,(6) PORT WORK HERE.The active development of our West Coast ports is essential and a strong Port Department should be established to take the matter in hand forthwith. If this were done, a good deal of dangerous navigation of the English Channel could be avoided. Railway, facilities should be simultaneously developed.(7) RESERVE OF SHIPS.The reserve of ships is a cardinal point of my scheme and the use of the ships in distant waters or the laying of them up on the other side, ought not to be - dene.   It should not be overlooked that, having a reserve of ships, we could improve them technically to protect them against torpedoes and mines - a thing which cannot be done while they are in use and could not be done if the reserve were formed in distant waters.   It may be added that the reserve of ships would probably be over 600, after providing for the carriage, of 30,000,000 tons of cargo per year.(.8) EXPORT TRADE.As is pointed out in my memorandum, arrangements must immediately be made to safeguard industries specially affected by the cutting-off of markets. The chief of these is the cotton trade.    It would be necessary to enter Into immediate negotiations with the federations of masters and men and to guarantee such financial and other assistance as would enable them to keep going and to produce 50 or 60^ of their normal output.     These arrangements would be helped by the fact that the scheme does not come suddenly into operation.(9) INDIA AND THE DOMINIONS.In regard to India and the Dominions, the problem is almost entirely a financial one and ought to be settled liberally.       As I have said already, this is a small matter as compared with the financial assistance that r-e have given to foreign nations.Ministry of Shipping. May 11th, 1917(Intld).       L.C.M.
