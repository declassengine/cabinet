Meetings of Committees, at which the Board were represented, have already b,een convened in Haddington, tforfar, 3?ife and Mnlithgow, and Exeoutive Committees have been re-appointed in these areas to carry out the work required for the 1918 orop.   *he Committeeo are generally sanguine as to the increased cultivation to he undertaken for this orop and they anticipate that the additional acreage proposed for 1918 (tentatively estimated for the whole of Scotland at 350,000 acres) will be obtained.   Arrangemente have practically been completed for similar meetinge in every county in Scotland at an early date.3. Repair of disused Meal Mills:As part of their food production scheme the Board have re-quested Metriot Committees to supply information regarding meal mille in all parts of the oountry which have been allowed to fall into disrepair, with a view to deoiding whether they should be put into working order at the present time.* * deeding of Rams for Show and Sale:The Board have called the attention of Committees to the praotioe of over-feeding rams intended for show or sale in the autumn and they have issued a circular deprecating the practice in view of the need of strict economy in feeding stuffs.5 * Supply of Potatoes for consumption in Scotland:During the past few weeks potatoes supplied by the Army Canteen Committee and Messrs TT. Dennis and Sons have arrived fairly regular-ly in Glasgow and Edinburgh and to a less extent in Aberdeen and Dundee.   The Board, however, regret to learn that the consignment of 10,000 tons arranged to be purchased from tho Army Canteen Committee is likely to be reduced to a maximum of 4,500 tons.

ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH.11th May, 1917.Sir,MEAL MILLS.I am directed by the Board of Agriculture for Soot-land to inform you that their attention has been drawn to the fact that there are in certain districts of the country meal mills which have been allowed to fall into disrepair and disuse, and it has been represented to them that in many cases great in-convenience and loss vjould be obviated were these mills to be put into a state of repair.     The Board have had this question under consideration, but before taking any action they desire to have definite information on the subject for eaoh district of Sootland.     I am accordingly to request that your Committee will be good enough to furnish particulars of any suoh disused mills in their area which it is considered should be put into working order stating wherever possible:-(1) The situation of the mill.(2) The name of the proprietor, and tenant, if any.(3) The period during which the mill has been disused.(4) The area likely to be served by the mill, and the situation of the nearest mill which is in working order.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H.M.CONAOHERSeoretary.The Seoretary,District Agricultural Executive Committee,

ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH. 15th May, 1917.Sir,Feeding of Rams for Show and Sale.I am directed &quot;by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to call the attention of your Committee to the practice, very common in past years, of feeding heavily rams intended for show and sale in the autumn.   In view of the necessity for the exercise of the strictest economy in the use of feeding.stuffs it is desirable that every possible step should be taken to discourage this practice during the present season, especially as over-feeding is not conducive to the health and usefulness of the individual sheep.   The Board would strongly impress upon prospective sellers the undesirability of giving their animals more food than is necessary to keep them in a healthy condition;   and they hope also that prospective buyers will assist in this matter by declining to purchase animals which have been fed with a view to securing a good appearance in the sale-ring rather than good condition and efficiency.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, H. M. CONACHSR. Secretary.The Secretary,District Agricultural Executive Committee,
