WAR   CABINET.SECRET G.T. 752INTELLIGENCE BUREAU,Department of Information.SECTION D. D.G.W/004WEEKLY REPORT ON GREECE.    IV. May 17, 1917.In last week&apos;s Report (No. Ill) I suggested that Mr. Zaimis was not in a position to unite the country or form any bridge between King Constantine and the Venizelist movement,   Greek papers (down to May 7) to hand confirm this.     Mr. Zaimis is widely respected and no paper in Greece at present would be so tactless as openly to attack him, but there is no hopeful-ness as to his prospects.    Mr. Ghounaris1 -organ, the Esperinon Neon Asti. frankly says that Mr. Zaimis is not any more likely to succeed this time than last time.     It openly puts the blame for the impasse which has been reached on the Protecting Powers who have &quot;declared Venizelos their ally&quot;. The able and influential Nea Imera goes further.     It informs Mr. Zaimis that he will find the Greek people a &quot;keen and obedient and sincere collaborator in the proposed propitiation of the Entente&quot;, but his Government &quot;would be over thrown at once by popular outcry if it should try to &quot;bridge (the gulf between) Athens -and Salonika&quot;.      For all its loyalty the Nea Imera goes on to warn the King that he would cease to be the Nation1s adored leader if he attempted a reconciliation with Mr-, Venizelos or dallied with the idea of intervention in the war.What chance is. there, then, of reconciliation?     The Venizelists have definitely abandoned any wish to come to terms With King Constantine.     The King is certainly not enthusiastic for a rapprochement and if he were would not carry
with him the anti-Venizelist politicians and party-cliques who control the Peloponnese and certain country districts of Central Greece (as far North and including Lamia in Malis). These party-cliques have no programme except keeping their own position and eliminating Venizelos from public life. To them all questions of Ententophilia or Ententophobia are of purely secondary importance.     The King^ position is a similar one.   He is primarily neither Ententophil nor Ententophobe.     His first hought is for his own prestige and the safety of the dynasty with which he - probably in perfectly good faith - identified the interests of Greece.     He is, therefore, increasingly opposed to Mr, Venizelos and it is hard to see how the gulf can ever be bridged.     Certainly Mr. Zaimis will not be able to do it, for he&quot; can influence neither one side nor the other.A.W.A.L.May 17, 1917.
