HOSPITAL     SHIPS.Synopsis of Admiralty Case.Tho question is whether Hospital Ships should beallowed to carry as passengers -(1)   Reliefs for other Hospital Ships:(2)   Officers and men of the R.A.M.O.(3)   Medical stores like waggons only capable of use for land Hospitals.The Hague Convention does not explicitly deal with these points.The Admiralty were forced to consider the point by a case at Port Said in July 1916, where a French Patrol ordered a British Hospital Ship into Port for carrying troops (really R.A.M.O. In khaki).Admiralty&apos;&apos;viewed the practices as those which a reasonable&quot;&apos; enemy and impartial Prize Court-would probably recognise as&quot; legal, but that there was a danger of Germany utilising the uncertain legality of the practices as a pretext for refusing to recognise Hospital Ships.     In September 1916 they asked the foreign Office for their opinion.The Foreign Office in their reply agreed with the Admiralty as to the probable legality of (1), but thought the practice undesirable on the grounds of expediency, f) On (2) the Foreign Office went further than theAdmiralty. They thought (2) much more difficult to defend, had serious doubt as to it3 legality at all; in any case it was extremely undesirable and considered the practice should he abandoned.__ On
On this the Admiralty gave the orders (October 1916) for the prohibition of the carriage of (1) and (2), adding (3) as being an analogous case affecting stores.The Admiralty view was the inexpediency of permitting practicos of doubtful legality, when in their opinion Germany was on the watch for pretexts to refuse recognition to Hospital Ships.In November 1916, the War Office protested against this decision mainly on the ground that the Hague Convention did not apply to all Military Hospital Ships.     Correspondence ensued but before any settlement was reached the German Govern-ment issued their Memorandum of the 28th January 1917.ThebGerman Memorandum oited instances of breaches of tho law, stigmatising the worst as the carriage of troops and munitions.     The chief instance given was a case of 300 infantrymen in marching order at Cardiff (really R.A.M*G. reliefs).     On this they refused to recognise Hospital Ships in tho Channel.The Admiralty hold that if the practices are continued it may lead to the Germans refusing recognition in all zones. This will entail serious disadvantages, including the practical difficulties of escort in all parts of the world. Escort itself, even were it possible to provide the vessels, does not guarantee absolute safety and is therefore an inferior substitute for enemy observance of the Convention.(Intlld.)

STATEMENT OP AJMRALTY CASE.The question for decision is &quot;whether Hospital Shipsshould bo allowed to convey the following (as passengers):-1.-    Persons not belonging to the staff of theHospital Ship which transports them and who are being conveyed as reliefs for other Hospital Ships.2.-    Officers and men of the Royal Army Medical Corps.3.-    Certain kinds of Hospital Stores, viz: those onlycapable of being used on land, such as ambulancewaggons, and which therefore cannot be claimedas having any connection with Hospital Ships.It is agreed on all sides that there is no explicit provision in the Hague Convention.     The question of legality therefore would be a matter of inference from the underlying principles of the Convention.The matter arose from the following submission fromthe Deputy Naval Transport Officer, Port Said, on the 31stJuly last.     In view of the accusations in the GermanM-emorandum of 28th January last (as to oarrying troops), andthe subsequent refusal to accord Hospital Ships irnmunity, thesubmission is worth recording in full :-&quot;Port Said, July 31st 1916.&quot;The Hospital Ships 1 Nevasa1 and 1Oxfordshire1 &quot;which arrived Port Said, outward bound, on 29th nand 30th July respectively, both carried such &quot;a number of R.A.M.C. men in khaki as to make it &quot;appear they had troops on board.&quot;Nevasa   was actually ordered into Algiers &quot;by a French patrol on this account.   I beg to &quot;suggest that, with an unscrupulous enemy, this &quot;practice will probably lead   to Hospital Ships &quot;being torpedoed&quot;.The Ao^iiralty considered this case, and consultedthe Foreign Office in September 1916 upon the point.   Theysuggested that the practice of carrying reliefs might borecognised as legal by a reasonable enemy and an impartialPrize Court.     On the question of expediency however, theypointed
pointed out the danger that Neutrals might honestly form the impression that we  were exceeding our legal rights and that when these reports reached Germany, the latter might refuse to recognise British Hospital Ships any longer.The Foreign Office on September 27th agreed with the Admiralty.     They thought that a good case could be made out fbr (1) above, viz:-   carriage of reliefs for other Hospital Ships, but that the practice was undesirable, particularly as it was &quot;clearly inadvisable to provide the German Government with any &quot;pretext for sirldng Hospital Ships&quot;.As regards (2), the R.A.M.O., Lord Grey thought it much more difficult to defend, and that he had serious doubts as to its being justifiable under the terms of the Convention. In any case thero could be no doubt it was extremely undesira-blc at present and he considerod the practice should he abandoned.On this the Admiralty gave orders for tho prohibition of tho carriage of (1) and (2), adding, as an analogous case, (3)y viz:- Stores only capable of use in land Hospitals.The Acmriralty case was therefore fcased on the inexpod-iency of continuing practices, the lagality of which was at least undetermined, if not extremely doubtful, when in tholrvview the enemy were on the watch for the pretext tc refuse recognition to Hospital Ships.     Tho doubt as tc legality was admittedly a factor in the judgment of inexpediency, and if a-decision definitely legalising these practices could be obtained from an authoritative tribunal capable cf binding all bolliger-ents, the Admiralty would gladly a-ltor their view.     As, however, no such tribunal was in existence, and as Germany would bo unlikely to bow to the rulings of British Government Departments or English Law Officers as to tho legality of tho practices, tho oriterion was not law but expediency.    And cf expediency in Naval matters the Admiralty   are, and must be,
rr-a-the judge.     In that capacity the Admiralty pronounced the practices inexpedient and therefore prohibited then.If any proof were required of tho soundness of this view, it is supplied-by the accusations in the Gorman Memorandum of 28th Januar;/ last.     In this the German Government described the carrying of &quot;troops&quot; as the &quot;worst breach&quot; of the Convention and two out of the three, instances cited in support of this allegation relate to the ease of the &quot;Formosa&quot; at Cardiff, where &quot;300 infantrymen in roarching order&quot; are stated to have fee en t alien on &quot;board the ship&quot;.    Enquiry was made into this accusation, and the Director of Transports reported that R.A.M.C reliefs were in fact conveyed by this ship, and it seems olear that the &quot;troops&quot; in question -were these R.A.M.C. units, who being in khaki uniform were doubtless mistaken for combatant soldiers.In requesting the War Office on 27th April last to issue orders prohibiting the embarkation of passengers on board Hospital Ships, the Admiralty, after alluding to this instance, pointed out that tho German Memorandum (and the consequential abolition of all Channel Hospital Ships) confirmed the accuracy of the Admiralty predie tions, and that the continuance of the Gbjcotlonable practice in question would give the enemy a pretext, whenever he desired one, for refusing immunity to Hospital Ships anywhere.     It is hardly necessary to observe that so far from the change in the situation since last September pointing to the desirability of modifying the Adrairaity opinion then- expressed, it has proved the soundness of that opinion which the Admiralty now ask should be made an universal rule for all British Hospital Ships.It remains to notice the War Office objections.Tho chief argument of the Army Council was that War Office Hospital Ships are not governed by the Hague Convention at all, but by the Geneva Convention 1906, with which view,the
the Admiralty disagreed.     Upon this somowhat startling con-tention of the War Office, it does not seem necessary to say more than to remark that the English Law Officers on being appealed to by the War Office pronounced the contention to bo without authority.At the same time, however, tho War Office, apparently abandoning their doctrine that Hospital Ships wore not governed by the Hague Convention at all, asked the Law Officers to advise on the Hague Convention itself.     In reply the Law Officers gave their opinion on the 2nd April that the practices (1), (2) and (3), are legal under that Convention, also that the mattor seems to bo one of expediency, upon which they think that Germany&apos; s attitude to Hospital Ships will not be affected by the use of the ships for the purposes in question.On this it need only be said that, as already pointed out, both Admiralty and Foreign Office have always considered an impartial Prize Court might hold the practice to be legal, that the Admiralty cannot regard the opinions of English Law Officers as decisive with the German Government or as settling the whole matter, and that on the question of expediency in Naval Warfare the Admiralty, and not the Law Officers, must bo the proper judge. -The Admiralty continue to regard the practices asinexpedient for the following reasons:-1.    Their continuance gives Germany a pretext for denying immunity to Hospital Ships all over the World.2.    Tho results of such denial, quite apart from its retrogressive tendency in international law, mean, inter alia, that escorts have to be provided to safeguard Hospital Ships.     This has already happened with the cross-Channel Hospital Ships, now termed Ambulance Transports.     Provision of escort means withdrawal of Naval units from other work from which they cannot well be spared.    Even escort is not an absolute guarantee of safety, and is therefore an inferior substitute for enemy observance of the Convention.3.    The drain upon Naval resources would be greatly intensified were it necessary to escort Hospital Ships in all parts of the World, for obvious reasons. 4
4.    Practices of doubtful legality present the enemy with evidence capable of distortion and mis-representation to serve his own ends.   Accusatory memoranda are circulated to Keutrahs, which tend to promoting an opinion that hoth belligerents violate the laws of war.     Great Britain has maintained, a fairly high standard so far.    To lower it would be regrettable ,and only defensible on strong groun&amp;S&quot;-of practical expediency.Admiralty,15th May 1917.
