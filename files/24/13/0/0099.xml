This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. RET.- INDIAN BULLETIN No. 7.EXPLANATORY NOTES.1. New Formations. The Government of India undertook to release 12 Territorial battalions for other theatres of war. Five of these have left India, but, in consequence of the Mahsud trouble on the frontier, the Government of India have for the present retained the remaining seven Battalions.The Indian battalions sent to Mesopotamia were to be replaced by 13 newly raised Indian battalions. Eight of these are now complete, and the remainder within 625 men of completion.The Government of India had been asked (see Indian Bulletin No. 4) whether, in addition to the -numbers they were already raising, as many as 100,000 men could be raised to put into the field in the early spring of 1918. They now report that, owing to the possible diminution of Russian pressure upon Turkey, the army in Mesopotamia may require considerable reinforce-ments from September next. To replace trained troops which they may then have to send over-seas they think it prudent, therefore,-that they should now raise the equivalent of two divisions, viz., 24 battalions plus divisional troops. The number of battalions to be raised will thus be 24, instead of the 23 mentioned in a previous bulletin.In order to raise these additional units and at the same time augment the 94 Indian battalions to the British War Establishment, besides finding the 20,000 Indian gunners and drivers demanded by the War Office, the Government of India must recruit over 89,000 men. To provide the drafts required to maintain the ^increased numbers serving in the field, they will have to recruit over 17,000 men a month, that is to say, over 4,500 in excess of the average number enlisted during the&apos; last -three months.To obtain these men the terms of service must be improved, and the total estimated cost of the Government of Iudia&apos;s proposal in the first year is 5,000,0001. This would be borne by the War Office, to whom the proposal has been referred.The Government of India have been asked to raise one Labour and one Porter Corps for Mesopotamia, in addition to the 30,000 already being raised for France.2.

Internal Conditions. Home Rule agitation continues, but there have been no new developments. An attempt to organise it at Shikarpur in Sind failed owing to its ostracism by conservative Mohamedans. Anti-Brahman movement in Madras is maintained, and newspaper &quot; Justice,&quot; the organ of the movement, is gaining strength.Response to the call&apos;for Indian volunteers for the ^Defence Force is so far infinitesimal. The country generally is quiet, but there is a little anxiety regarding possibility of agrarian trouble between planters and cultivators in Ghamparan, a distriet of Bihar. There have been one or two small recruiting-scares. Offers of assistance continue to be received from Ruling Chiefs. Of those recently received special mention may be made of IBikaners gift of Rs. 2,50,000 (21 lakhs) and the gift of: the Raja of Dewas (junior branch) of Rs. 1,30,000 towards expenses of the war. Im response, to an appeal.to bring Reserves of their Imperial Service troops to a-strength sufficient to maintain them in the field on active service the Darbars concerned have been making strenuous efforts to stimulate recruiting within their States. In many cases Indian Army rates of pay and pension have been adopted together with other concessions, and men have been transferred from the State Forces to the Imperial Service Battalions: It is hoped that measures taken will prove sufficient.
