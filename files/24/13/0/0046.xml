SECRETCopy No, 1 30.3/101/29$.The present situation in regard to Military Assistance by the United States.A number of telegrams and letters have been received from Lt.Gen. G.T.M. Bridges during the past 10 days. From these reports it is clear that we cannot expect a considerable U.S.A, Army to be in the field in any theatre of war for a long time to come.  -The present position of America is only analagous to that of Great Britain in 1914 in so far as the potentialities of man-power and material production are concerned.   Regarded solely from this point of view, the United States have an advantage.   Their population is greater,   Their factories have expanded and they have gained experience in the course of manufacturing for the Allies.The comparison here ceases.   The United States have very much smaller experienced cadres of General Staff, Administrative or Regimental officers than we had at the beginning of the war, nor can their regular forces compare with ours as they were in 1914 either for the purpose of rapid employment in the field or for dilution.While Americans have followed carefully the course of the r/ar they have not dreamed until recently that they would be closely affected.   As a consequence not only have they taken no steps towards the establishment of the elaborate machinery essential to the formation and maintenance of a modern army in the field, but they are frankly amazed at thethem by our Military Mission.A small nucleus for the foundation of a General and an Administrative Staff exists, but as yet there is no proper organization or system of coordination.vastnoand complexity of that machinery as now disclosed to
1 0There is evidence to show that the Americans realize the necessity of co-ordination and General Bridges is hopeful of being able to overcome the difficulties which are chiefly those of jealousy and a fear that the vjaval or Military Authorities may become too powerful.An initial step in the right direction has been taken in regard to armaments.    It has been decided that it is not practicable to introduce fresh calibres into the theatres of war and that it is therefore neoessary that the American forces should be provided either with British or with French armament,.    These armaments oan be produced in America, but the installation of the machinery for their production must take some considerable time.    More especially ic this the oase as it is very desirable that there should be no interruption in the supply of tools, machinery and munitions now being obtained from America for the Allies. &apos;Questions of military policy could not be considered in any detail by the American General Staff until the passing cf the Compulsion Bill.liow, however,  the British and French Missions arepressing for the following points:-i.    ro get a regular division,  followed by reinforoements, over to Prance with the least possible delay,  and to complete its training there in a camp handed over to the U c Se2,    To dilute the regular Army by withdrawal of personnel for instructors,  and to fill up from the now levy.3.    To have a second division ready as soon as possible to follow the first.4.    Arrangements for ultimate flow of troops as transport is available.Though nothing has as yet been decided a&amp; to thedestination of the first troops sent over, General Bridgesbelieves that sentiment, armament, and linguistic factors willforce the Africans to oome to us rather than to the French.
Concurrently with the consideration and organization of the main American forces as outlined above, arrangements are in train for the despatch of such medicalt aeronautical, railway and labour personnel as may be possible in the present eiroumstanoes.     The latter will be either-directly employed with one or other of the Allies on the Western front or will be trained with a view to joining eventually main American forces.General Staff, War Office.,17th May,&apos; 1917-.
