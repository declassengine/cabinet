MARTIN&apos;S LANE,printers in ordinary to his majesty,
1. In the appended tables statistics are given showing the aggregate imports into Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland during (a) the year 1916 ; (6) the quarter January-March, 1917, as compared with imports in pre-war years.2. These figures give a broad idea of the general position, but it is obvious that in some cases a record of imports into each country might give different results. The reason why they have been aggregated in this way is to avoid representations from any particular Government that in view of the lowness of any one import we ought to allow them to have an additional quantity in the future. Moreover, the issue of figures showing that imports of a particular commodity into a particular country had been sub-normal would almost certainly tend to encourage heavy shipments -of that commodity to that country, possibly resulting in excessive imports in the future.3. The figures relating to imports since the outbreak of war have been compiled from the records in the possession of this Department relating to the cargoes of all vessels reaching the countries in question from all sources other than. Germany. The scheme of com-pilation is not dependent in any way on the import returns of the four countries, nor on the export returns of the countries of supply, although it may be stated that substantial agree-ment is found to exist between the import statistics compiled in this Department and those issued, from time to time, by the countries in question.4. Where raw materials have been imported into one of the countries for the purpose of being worked up and forwarded to England or to an allied country, they have been excluded from the import figures, since they are not destined for neutral con-sumption, and obviously cannot be passed on to the enemy. Similarly, imports into Holland on behalf of the Belgian Relief Commission have been excluded.5. The statistics of average imports in 1911-13 have been calculated from the official trade returns for those years issued by the importing countries. These figures should be regarded as approximate only, since the different systems of classification in force in the four countries have rendered it necessary to resort to estimates in some cases.6. Where in the case of a particular commodity the exports of any one of the countries exceeded the imports in pre-war years, the pre-war imports by that country have been taken as zero, and not as a negative quantity by which the imports of the other three countries are to be reduced.7. In comparing current with pre-war imports it must be borne in mind that the course of normal development results, generally speaking, in progressive increases in the imports of commodities during successive years. The average figures for 1911-13, which are given in the appended tables, may be taken as applicable, generally, to the mean year 1912, and there would, in the ordinary course, be a not inconsiderable increase in the period of the four or five years which have since elapsed.8. On the other hand, the mere fact that imports have been no greater than in pre-war years would not, of itself, afford sufficient grounds for assuming that there has been no leakage to enemy countries. There are, however, many other safeguards in operation such as the prohibitions against re-export in force in the importing countries, the care which is taken to secure that goods do not get into the hands of unreliable consignees, the guarantees which are required against direct or indirect re-export, and the general supervision exercised by importing agencies, such as the Netherlands Oversea Trust.R.

Butter.-Upwards of 1,050 tons of the imports during 1916, and the whole of the imports during the quarter January to March, 1917, were for the manufacture of margarine mixtures for England.Note 2.  Meat. With minor exceptions, all the imports were into one of the.four countries, the increase over the pre-war average being due to the inability to import live cattle.Note 3.  Tea. The 1916 imports include consignments for subsequent re-export to England.   During the year...   1916, these re-exports.amounted to.5,943. tons. Note 4.   Hides and Skins of native production are unsuited to local needs.  Imports in 1916 were accordingly greater than the pre-war imports less all exports
