The number of fresh soldier pension claims dealt withduring the week was 3,600 as compared with 2,000 during the previous week.     Awards were made in all but 3 oases,- 2,653 pensions and 944 gratuities being granted.     1,333 pensions were reassessed under the New Warrant without application in advance of the end of the conditional periods for which they were granted.During the week 31 men previously rejected were awarded pensions and 330 received gratuities.     W2 of these cases have been dealt with up to date and 3,400 are in various stages of treatment.In consequence of audit results and in view of a threatened accumulation of cases some reorganisation of the Awards of Pensions to Soldiers Branch was decided on which will increase the number of Award Officers and ensure a further checking of Awards.     The First Awards and renewal sections of the Branch will now be under separate heads, the former^ which will be- partly civilian^elng under Mr. H. De la Bere, C,B. and the latter consisting entirely of Military Officers under Major General Dickson.       In consequence of the reorganisation Mr. De la Bere is being appointed to tho Advisory Board.The Award to Sailors Branch continues at Great George Street to be organised on much the same lines as it was at the admiralty.2.   The acceleration of the progress in the reassessment of dependants pensions (Appendix I) is shown by the following returnWeek ending April 11th.........,..........38&quot; &quot; &quot;     18th ,..................694&quot;        &quot; &quot;     25th..................113011        &quot;      May, 2nd     .................1687&quot; &quot;    9th     ..................2102M &quot; &quot;    16th............... .,.-.24408091There
There remain some 66,909 still Ho be dealt with.     Of this week&apos;s 2,440 cases 1.177 dependants have benefited by reassessment to the average extent of 4/3d a week.As a result of reexamination as to Entitlement (Appendix II) 113 widows cases have been disposed of during the week.     Of these 38 widows who had been refused pensions have now been admitted under either Article 11 or Article 15 of the Warrant and 78 aggravation (formerly gratuity) cases have become pensionable under Article 11.    No widows&apos; cases have been rejected.    7 Depen-dants have been admitted to pension or gratuity and 2 have been finally rejected.     Only 680 cases (widows and dependants) npw remain to be dealt with out of the original total of 4,523.1,040 ( 3) grants have been authorised this week (989 Army and 51 Navy) as against 942 last week.3.   For the purpose of securing more complete knowledge of the provisions of the Royal Warrant by persons lntereuted in them two leaflets have been issued by the Ministry during the week. The first called &quot;Soldiers1 Pensions, 1917&quot; of whioh a copy Is annexed as Appendix III takes the place of &quot;What the soldier wants to know&quot; which explained former disability pension Warrants.     A copy is being sent to every pensioner and will in future bo Issued&apos; 6n discharge ta all disabled men.     The other leaflet termed &quot;Pensions and Gratuities.     Comparison of Old and New Warrants&quot;^ (Appendix IV) is for the use of members of Local Committees and other persons who have to explain at public Meetings or otherwise the additional advantages of the new enactments.4.     A Meeting with the Statutory Advisers to the Minister was held on the 17th instant to consider a letter from the War Office to the Treasury (Appendix V) commenting on the draft Officers1 Warrant.     The principal matter to which the War Office take exception is the raising to the highest rate of pension of thewidow
widow of the officer whose death was not due to active operationsin the field &quot;but resulted rather from ordinary risks to health lofpm which civilians as well as soldiers may be exposed.     At theMeeting it was decided that the views of the Army Council shouldbe met if some definition could be agreed upon with them which wouldprovide for the intermediate rate being given abroad as well asin the United Kingdom in cases of death resulting from such risksas they had referred to and the highest rate being secured to thewidows of officers who succumbed to illness which could be directlytraced to fatigue, privation or exposure, Incident to active operationswhether abroad or In the United Kingdom.S.     On the 17th instant the Royal Assent was given to the Naval and Military War Pensions etc. ^Administrative Expenses) Bill, 1917, and to the National Insurance (Part I Amendment) Bill, 1917,6.     A statement of the proceedings of the Statutory Committee for the week ending the 16th May, is annexed as Appendix VI.Thej&amp;e Inspector^ report favourably on the work of the Local Committees at Todmorton and Barrow-in-Furness.     Dublin appears to be making some effort to make up for lost time.     At Grimsby the providing of a Farm Colony for Neurasthenics is being taken up locally. At Birkenhead the sources of voluntary assistance are drying up.The difficulties with regard to men discharged to Class W. and unfit to work still continue and the War Office authority asked for last week for Local Committees tc support the families of these men as well as the men themselves has not yet been received.     The Vice-chairman of the Statutory Committee Is pressing on the Minister the need for further representations being made to the War Office.7.     Local ttar Pension Committees are readily falling in  ttith   the suggestion of the Minister that they should combine to form Joint Committees for the exercise of certain of their powers for dealing with the after-care of disabled men.     In Lancashire, whichcontains
contains over 4i Loeal Committees, an informal Advisory Committee has been already meeting undor the Chairmanship of Mr, Cozens-Hardyg Inspector of the Statutory Committee, and1&quot;has&apos;drawn ofe. a very comprehensive preliminary survey &quot;of ail&quot; the facilities for treatment and training within the County. A further Meeting will be held on Monday to consider the formal appointment of a Joint Committee.A circular of tvhich a proof forms Appendix VIII hereto, is now being Issued by the Ministry to all Local Committees, advising them as to their procedure informing Joint Committees, and pointing out the desirability of representatives of labour, and of the medical and technical training professions bfcing members of such Committees.8.     The Minister received on Tuesday the 15th instant a deputation of members of the British Medical Association who had asked for information as to the arrangements proposed for providing medical treatment for discharged disabled men. Certain questions had been put to the Minister at a Meeting at Brighton by a local Doctor on account of which the association desired further information.The deputation raised the following points:-(1)   Its to the representation to be accorded to the profession on the statutory Committee and Local War Pensions Committees.     The iidnister pointed out that the composition of the Statutory Committee was determined by Act of Parliament and that th   association should have taken steps to secure their oim representation at the time and that in fact the Statutory Committee had appointed an eminent Doctor on its disablement Sub-Committee.As regards Local Committees their composition was determined entirely by the Local Authority - the County or Tovm Council - by-whom they viere appointed Etnd the iviinister had no power to require representation of Doctors on them.\ The
?he Statutory Committee had, however, in snrecrent circTXTaYnyaTled the attention of Local-Committees to the desirability of getting medical representation on their disablement sub-Committees.(2)   As to any special arrangements for the treatment of discharged disabled men where any subsequent Incapacity was due to &quot;the caiitse for which they were disabled.     It was represented that much extra *.?ork was being thrown on t *e general practitioners by such cases of insured men on his panel list and that they claimed recognition of this by extra remuneration.Mr.- Barnes intimated that the Ministry was only concerned to provide specialist treatment under Article 6 of the Warrant and that the question of treatment of disabled men so far as it affected panel practice must be a matter to be considered in the first Instance with the Insurance Commissioners.Reference was also made by the deputation to the work of Medical Practitioners for discharged soldiers and sailors in voluntary hospitals being paid for.In conclusion Mr. Barnes suggested that the association should nominate two or three of their members to act with representatives of the Koyal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians as a small advisory Committee to assist him in considering the draft instructions for the treatment of disabled men which wore be inn; issued to the Local Committees and for other purposes. Subsequently the Minister sa- Dr. Fredrick Taylor, President of the Royal College of Physicians who was willing to nominate two Physicians to serve on this Advisory Committee.9.     Complaints have been received in certain cases, and In particular from the London fear Pensions Committee, that discharged disabled men suffering from tuberculosis were, in some cases, unable to obtain the institutional treatment deemed necessary.     The cases in question appear to be mostly thoso of advanced tuberculosis. The Minister has discussed tho matter both vith the InsuranceCommissioners
Commissioners and the Local Government Board, and he understands it to he the case that Insurance Committees are,not, in all cases, able to provide institutional treatment for advanced cases, which often needs such treatment for prolonged periods.     In these circumstances the Minister approached the Metropolitan Asylums Board, through the intermediary of the Local Government Board, with a view to ascertaining whether beds could be provided for advanced cases.     The Metropolitan Asylumns Board have now arranged to set aside a limited number of beds in two of their hospitals for the accommodation of discharged disabled men, and the London V/ar Pensions Committee hasrgbeen informed that it is open to them to send advanced cases of tuberculosis to these institutions in any case where they are informed by the Insurance Committee that that Committee is not prepared to provide such treatment.10.     A difficulty which had arisen in regard to the training of disabled men in the V^est of England has been fortunately settled with the assistance of a representative of the ministry of Labour.    - A Joint Committee of Wiltshire, Gloucester, and Somerset had been provisionally formed and had proposed a scheme of training centring in the Merchant Venturers College at Bristol, The Bristol Local -ar Pensions Committee had, however, proposed aw independent scheme which took no account of this institution, and had dissociated itself from the proposed Joint Committee. Personal negotiations, however, have succeeded in removing the difficulty with the result that the Merchant Venturers College which is an institution of substantial technical equipment will be utilised for a large portion of the technical training to be given to discharged disabled men in that area, while the Joint Committee will be reconstructed to provide for the inclusion of the Bristol Local War Pensions Committee.
11.     The report of the Trade Advisory Committee on the employment of disabled sailors and soldiers in the Cinema industry annexed hereto as Appendix VII is of interest as showing the good feeling which will provide a useful opening to a considerable number of maimed men.12.     The Inter-Allied Conference in Paris on the After-care of disabled soldiers was formally opened in the presence of the President of the French Republic on May 8th.     In addition to the Ministry of Pensions the War Office, the Admiralty, the Canadian Army Medical Corps and the British Red Cross Society were represented.     The Conference was divided into six sections which met on the 8th? 9th and 10th, while on the 11th and 12th visits were paid to various hospitals and training centres in Paris and the neighbourhood. -  Papers were read by Sir Arthur&apos;Boscawen and Sir Charles Nicholson at the sixth section (Documentation et Propagande), by Sir Berkeley Moynihan at the 1st section (Reeducation Physique), by Major Mitchell at the 2nd section (Reeducation Professionelle) and by Lord Charnv/ood at the 3rd section (Placement ot Etablissement des Invalides).     Among the Institutions visited were the Grand Palais, the Maison Blanche, the In3titut National Professionel des Invalides do la Guerre at Saint Maurier and the Institut Mllitaire Beige de Reeducation Professionelle at Port Villez.     A full report on the tour and its results will be presented by the Parliamentary Sbcretary shortly.13.       Table I shows that 9,728 new pensions, including children&apos;s allowances were granted during the week against 8,012 last week and 10,973 in the previous week.     Since the beginning of the war up to the 16th instant 635,119 pensions, including children1 s allowances have been ,awarded.Table
Table II shows that last week 95 grants of supplementary-pensions and children&apos;s allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 86 in the previous week and that the total nttmber to date is 3,852.14.      Table III shows for the first time no increase in the staff of the Ministry during the week. There are now 171 men and2,742 women employed, or 2,913 in all.     The staff of the Statutory Committee comprises 103 men and 174 women or 274 in all bringing the grand total to 3,187.The total daily percentage of absences from the Ministry was 3.7 among the male and 5,9 among the female staff, the lowest yet recorded.     The percentages of absences among the female staff did not differ materially at any of the establishments from the average percentage.16.     Mr. A. D. Bailey, Inspector of Artificial Limbs, who has hitherto been working at the Contracts Department of the War Office has now gone to the Artificial Appliance Branch at Chelsea where a pattern room is being established.     Sir Alexander Diack, head of the Branch Is now visiting the various Limb-fitting hospitals and orthopaedic centres accompanied by Mr. Bailey.M.N.16th May, 1917.

. 6853-g 10.   125 m.   5/17.   d &amp; s.   G. 2.PENSIONS FOR SOLDIERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.ROYAL WARRANT OF  1917. SOLDIERS&apos; PENSIONS.SOLDIERS disabled by wounds, injuries or disease on military duty during this War will get pensions according to the degree of their disablement. The highest degree of disablement means that a mans injuries are so &apos;great that he cannot be expected to earn anything. His pension is then AT LEAST 27/6 A WEEK. He gets this pension if for instance he has lost two limbs. If he can still earn while drawing this 27/6 a week so much the better for him. That will not alter his pension.There is a list at the end of this paper by which degrees of disablement will be reckoned. For example, a man who has lost one eye, a leg below the knee, or the left arm below the elbow, is reckoned as half disabled. He gets a pension of 13/9 weekly. If he has lost two fingers of his right hand, the disablement is reckoned at one-fifth, and he gets 5/6. A man whose disablement is reckoned as less than one-fifth will have a gratuity instead of a pension.Injuries not included in the printed list, and diseases, will be estimated by a Board.
Service Pensions.Acting Rank.Allowances forChildren.A Board will also decide  whether disease caused by, or was made worse by military serv:. also whether a man was disabled by his own fauliIf a soldier is entitled to a service pension will get that in addition to his disablement pen: N.C.O&apos;s. and Warrant Officers will get(a) Either the same disablement pension as a pri\&quot; and their service pension in addition,(b) Or, if better for them, at the following rates For the highest degree of disablement: Warrant Officer Class I.......II. &amp;- N.C.O&apos;s. Class i. N.C.O&apos;s.       ...      ,,   II.   ...      ......III. IV.32For less degrees of disablement the pension will t in proportion.    Thus a Warrant Officer, Class who has lost an eye will get either 21/3 a week, -13/9 plus his service pension.A man who held paid acting rank at the time he v disabled will be pensioned according to the scale that rank.If a man is disabled in the highest degree he w get 5/-a week for the first child, if under 16, 4/2 foi second, 3/4 for the third and 2/6 for every other chiiIf he is disabled in a less degree, the - children allowances will be less in proportion as his pen e is less. A private with a pension of 13/9 will get 2 for the first child and so on.
The allowance for children of N.C.O&apos;s. and W.O&apos;s. is the same as for those of privates.The allowance for a child may be continued after it is 16 if it is apprenticed or being educated. e   . A soldier  may apply to  have his pension fixed according to his earnings before the war.If he can show that the pension and chi!dren&apos;s allowances with what he can still earn amount to less than what he earned before the war, he may be granted a pension which will bring his weekly money up to what he previously earned, provided it was not more than 50/- a week.If he earned more than 50/- a week before the war, his money may be brought up to 50 - plus half his earnings between 50/- and 100/-.Thus if he earned  3 10s. a week he may get 50/-plus 10/-, or  3 a week. The highest figure would be  3 15s.If a man was an apprentice before the war. or studying for a profession, allowance will be made in fixing his alternative pension for what he might have earned if he had continued his apprenticeship or education.If a man is so completely disabled that he requires constant attendance, he is given an allowance up to 20/- a week to pay for it.If the doctors think a man should have a course of medical treatment, and the man refuses, half of his pension may be with-held.
VVhile he is receiving any medical treatment&apos; may be prescribed for him which requires his o into hospital, a discharged soldier will have his per brought up to the highest degree of disablement and allowances will be given to his family.Training A mans permanent pension is not fixed urn;doctors consider that his injuries are as much as they are ever likely to be, butWhen once a permanent pension has granted it will  never be  reduced  becau man becomes able to earn more.i Men if they cannot go on with their formeron account of their injuries, may get free traini: some new occupation. During this training the) be given the highest degree of disablement pe and at the end of it a bonus at the rate of 5j- a for the time it lasted. If they have to live away home their families will get allowances.Gratuity A soldier who is discharged as medically uniDisablement causes in no *wa$ due to military service may h not Result    gratuity.   In some cases the gratuity may be as as  150.   Length and character of service, and matters will be taken into account.Former !f any soldier who was serving before the daRegulations. tne new regulations finds that former regulationsbetter for him, he can have his pension reckaccordingly,
WIDOWS&apos; PENSIONS.If a man has been killed in action during the war or has died from woundsxir from injuries while on duty, and through no fault of his own, or from disease con-tracted on active service or aggravated by service, his widow may get a pension equal to half the soldier&apos;s pension for the highest degree of disablement, accord-ing to his rank.A private&apos;s widow will get at least 13/9 a week.A widow will not be entitled to pension if she married the soldier after the end of the war, or after his discharge, or after he received the injury.A widow will get allowances for the soldiers children maintained by her at the rates paid for children of a man totally disabled.In no case will the pension of a widow be reduced because she is herself earning.A widow who can show that the pension granted to her, together with children&apos;s allowances, makes less than one-half the alternative pension, which would have been granted to the soldier, supposing he had lived but could not earn anything, may be granted one-half of that pension.If, for instance, her husband had been earning  4 a week before the war, he would have got a pension of 50/- plus 15/&apos;, or  3 5s. a week if he had been disabled in the highest degree, and his widow will get 32/6.
Additional Allowances to Widows.Widows&apos; Pensions in certain cases.A widow will also get(1) A grant of  3 on the death of her husbanc(2) 1/3 a week extra on reaching 45 years.(3) A grant not exceeding 12/6 a week for not rr than 13 weeks while she is undergoing a course instruction to fit her for work. Training fees may -be paid for her.The widow of a soldier who has died from ea not connected with military duty nor due to his e fault may get 15/&apos; a week during the war and 12 months after.If a soldier receiving disablement pension o: less than 10/- dies from causes not connected &apos; his military duty, his widow may get half his pen; provided she was living with him when he diedThe pension of a widow ceases on re- marriage a gratuity equal to one year&apos;s pension will be gi\ Allowances to children maintained by her conn&apos;PENSIONS TO MOTHERLESS CHILDREThe motherless child of a soldier who has die. consequence of military duty may be allowed i week.   If two or more such children are mainu; by one person, the allowance will be 7/- for the child, and 6j- for others.The same allowance is payable for children under the control of their mother.PARENTS&apos; PENSIONS.5/- may be allowed for an illegitimate child &apos;*&apos;--&apos; an affiliation order was in force.s
The parent (or parents) of a soldier who has died in consequence of military duty may get a pension equal to the weekly value of the assistance they may have had. from the soldier before the war, up to 15/- a week. In reckoning the amount, the cost of his keep when he lived at home is deducted.Pensions may be granted in respect of two or more sons, but the total coming to one parent or couple must not exceed 15/-.Parents who cannot support themselves and whose sons were apprentices or students who enlisted before they entered their trade or profession, or the mother of a soldier if his father has died during the war and she cannot support herself, may be granted a pension not exceeding 15/- a weekDEPENDANTS&apos; PENSIONS.Any other person, incapable of self support, who was wholly or partly dependant on the soldier immediately before the war, and who got separation allowance or was qualified to get it, may receive a pension not exceeding the amount received from him before the war, up to 5/- a week at most.Pensions to any female dependant cease, on marriage or re-marriage; but a gratuity of half a year&apos;s pension may be granted, and children&apos;s allowances continue.Soldiers and the widows and dependants of soldiers should go to the War Pensions Committee of their district for any further information about pensions, treatment and training.

APPENDIX V.WAR OFFICE,LONDON, S.W.12th Hay 1917.I ex: aorXi .r.dcd ti tlxa Ar^r Council to ccknmfLecige the-receipt of your letter of the 7th ins-tent-, N0.44&amp;6&amp;/L7 trans-mi tting a copy of a draft. Royal Warrant ameTuling for the pur-pose of the present war the existing pension provisions for officers and their families, and for the nursing services, and in reply to make the following remarks.1.   The Council desire to draw attention to the fact that the increased benefits under this new Warrant will only date from 1st June next whereas the corresponding provisions for soldiers and their families have effect from 1st April. It will he within Their Lordships&apos; recollection that the Royal Warrant of 26th November 1915, (Army Order 3 of 1916) embodying the proposals of the Select Committee on Officers&apos; pensions etc,r, had effect from 1st March, 1915, the date fixed for improved rates of pension for soldiers etc. (Army Orders 212 and 213 of 1915),2,   The Proposed method of assessing retired pay of disabled regular officers (Article 1 (2) of draft Warrant) is not altogether logical inasmuch as&apos;the existing rates, to which additions for disablement are to be made, are themselves not the ^service&quot; but the ^Disability&quot; rates of the Pay Warrantj but the Council appreciate the difficulty of devising scales which shall satisfy all the required conditions without creating serious complications, and they agree that the resultant rates, viewed apart from the method of arriving at them, are in themselves satisfactory.3.   The Council note with satisfaction that the Ministry propose to lower the age for Education Allowances from 13 to 9, a measure which they had it in mind themselves to submit to Their Lordships if the matter had remained in their handsj   and they would ask for sanction for this change of a&amp;e - and for the increase of the rate for girls from  25 to  35 to be applied in the few cases of &quot;ordinary&quot; pensions of widows and children arising out of the present war which remain under the jurisdiction of the Army Council.4.   The proposal of the Ministry in Article 11 (1) of the draft Warrant to bring the rates of widows&apos; pensions up to the maximum in every case attributable in any degree to the war is in the opinion of the Army Council open to very serious objec-tion.     Their Lordships are aware of the thorough and prolonged consideration given to this subject by the Select Committee as a result of which the question was left by the Royal V/arrant of 26th November 1915 in the following position.    There arethreeDPY./Rot.pay/280. (F.3.)Secretary, o fhe Treasury.
three scales of officers widows&apos; pensions (a) for killed in action cases etc. (b) for (i) deaths from wounds or injuries received through the performance of military duty not coming under (a) (ii) deaths from disease due to active operation in the field (iii) deaths from disease not so due but otherwise directly attributable to military service, (c) for deaths not attributable to military service, these last being awarded chiefly in respect of the officers service, and subject to other conditions.     Pensions (a) and (b) called &quot;highest&quot; and &quot;intermediate&quot; are under the Ministry of Pensions, while (c) called the &quot;ordinary&quot; pension, remains with this Department,   The respective rates range from  200  150,  100 for Colonels to  100,  75,  50 for Captains and Subalterns (war cases).   The Ministry propose to raise all cases under (b) to the pension rates under (a).Deaths under b (ii) were defined in the Pay Warrant of 1914 (Article 659) as due to &quot;Illness which can be directly traced to fatigue privation or exposure incident to active operations in the Field&quot;, and the Council have no objection to widows of this class being granted the highest rate of pension as the Officers&apos; death is distinctly due to war servico and is often caused by self-sacrificing devition to duty just as much as when an officer is killed in action.   The gratuities which the Ministry still reserve for the (a) cases preserve the historical and traditional distinction attached to &quot;killed in action&quot; cases.But the Council are strongly of opinion that deaths under b (iii) not duo to active operations in the field and corresponding rather to ordinary risks to health to which civilians as ?/ell as soldiers may be exposed, should not be merged in the highest class.   This category has already been raised from the ordinary to the intermediate rate by the Warrant of the 26th November 1915, and the Military Members of the Council have definitely given their opinion, not on financial grounds, but as representing the feeling of the Army against putting b (iii) cases in the same category fer pension as the widows of officers who have been killed in action or have succumbed to the privations and exposure of the campaign. . The objection becomes much stronger now that cases of aggravation (in whatever degree) are raised in the draft Warrant on to an equality with cases entirely due to military service, an extension which in practice will bring in nearly every case arising during tho war.The Council do not overlook the fact that for soldiers1 Tfidows there is only one scale, but in their opinion there is no justification for insisting on uniformity in this particular feature of the officers1 and soldiers&apos; schemes against authoritative military opinion,5, A few points arise as regards deceased officers1 relatives (a).   By the wording o/ paragraphs 19, the mother (or other dependant) of a regular officer commissioned at any time after the 4th August 1914, is ruled out, though the Officer may have given regular support, and the current regulation introduced by the Council T/ith Their Lordships&apos; sanction in December 1915 make her eligible.   In the opinion: of the Council this ri^ht should not be taken away.   In any case, it cannot be taken away from the dependants of officers now in the service, and in this connection the Council observe that the Draft V/arrant ^contains now explicit general recognt-tion of the doc-trine of reserved rights in non-effective matterscorresponding
to that Article 3 of the Pay Warrant.     Th.it Article, of course, re.;iains in force.(*b) In Article 21 of the draft warrant, it Is considered that the present condition that the officers&apos; sister is unfitted by age or infirmity to earn her living should be retained.6.     The Council observe that the Ministry have not inserted in the table of rates of widows1 pensions, figures for any rank above that of Colonel, leaving the grant as &quot;special&quot; as in the existing Farrant.     The Council have always felt that the practice, based on precedent,of awarding  500 a year in all cases (including Brigadier-Generals) is unduly lavish and the levelling up of practically all cases to the Highest scale (referred to above) brings the point into gre,;.t prominence.     They would suggest that the intro-duction of a new Warrant affords a convenient opportunity for introducing a more acquitable and graduated scale of &quot;Highest&quot; pensions for the widows of General Officers of different ranks *7,     The Council have no remarks on the proposals made for Nurses, or on other parts of the draft Warrant,I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(sgd) B.

APPENDIX VIII.295Circular No. 2.Local Committees,Formation of Joint Committees.MINISTRY OF PENSIONS,GREAT GEORGE STREET, S.W. 1.May, 1917.Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Pensions to refer to the powers given to Local Committees, by Section 2 (8) of the Naval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c, Act, 1915, to appoint Joint Committees for the joint exercise of any of the functions appertaining to the Local Committees under the Act.The functions of Local Committees for dealing with the After Care of Disabled Men, - including their treatment and training lend themselves, in the Ministers view, specially to joint action, and, as the Local Committee are aware, the Minister has endeavoured to promote the formation of Joint Committees to assist local action in this matter.In order that the formation of these Joint Committees may proceed on uniform lines, Mr. Barnes has thought it desirable to put the following suggestions before Local Com-mittees which are proceeding in the matter.The necessary preliminary resolutions have in some cases been already adopted, but it is essential, before any Joint Committee can come into effective existence, that each constituent Local Committee should pass a resolution substantially to the following effect: &quot; That the Local Committee should combine with the Local Committees of.............................. and     ...................... for the purposeof forming a Joint Committee within the meaning of Section 2 (8) of the Naval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c, Act, 1915, for the exercise of certain powers in connection with the treatment and training of disabled men.&quot;It is not sufficient for this purpose that the Local Committee should have resolved to appoint delegates to attend a conference for deliberation on the matter unless in so appointing delegates they specifically resolved that a Joint Committee should be formed.Establishment of Joint Committee.As a preliminary to the establishment of a Joint Committee, it is advisable that conferences should be held of representatives of the several Local Committees concerned, and in many areas such conferences have already been held. The conference should frame proposals, for submission to the constituent Local Committees, for the composition and functions of the Joint Committee. This can be done either at the full preliminary meetings themselves, or perhaps more readily by a sub-committee appointed by the full meeting.Composition of Joint Committee.The composition of the Joint Committee must be determined by the constituent Local Committees themselves, but the Minister desires to indicate two important considera-tions to be kept in view : (a) In order that the Joint Committee may be of workable proportions the repre-sentation from each constituent Local Committee should be strictly limited.(6) As the Joint Committees will be concerned with Disablement they should contain specific representation of industrial interests (employers and workpeople), of the medical profession and of technical instruction. It is of the utmost importance that the treatment and training of the disabled man should be dealt with primarily in accordance with expert opinion as to his physical capacity and as to his suitability for any particular trade and the opportunities for his permanent employment in that trade with due regard to the normal supply of labour in it.With these considerations in mind the model scheme enclosed is framed on the basis of providing (1) representation of each constituent Local Committee,(2) representation of labour and employers, of the medical profession and of technical instruction in such proportion to the total membership as may be determined.(B 9552)   Wt.        25, 75  5/17  H &amp; S
In order to secure this representation the Minister would suggest that the Local Committees should in the first instance appoint their individual representatives to the Joint Committee, and that thereafter these representatives collectively at a general meeting be given the power to invite representative organisations of employers and labour, and of the medical profession and of technical training, including Local Education Authorities, to recommend persons for appointment as members of the Joint Committee, and that on such recommendation the additional representatives, to the number laid down, should be appointed by the Joint Committee.Powers and Duties of the Joint Committee.The enclosure to this Circular contains a draft scheme for a Joint Committee, including suggestions for powers which might be delegated to it. It should be clearly understood that a Joint Committee can only exercise such powers as are expressly delegated to it by the constituent Committees. It is essential, therefore, that the scheme for the Joint Committee should explicitly set out the powers and duties which, it is intended should be delegated, and the scheme as a whole should then be adopted by formal resolution of each constituent Local Committee, and a copy of the resolution sent to the Ministry of Pensions.It will be realised that it is not possible at this stage to set out with any pretence at finality the functions which the Joint Committee will perform. These will vary widely in different areas, and will need constant adjustment and adaptation. The powers suggested in the accompanying scheme have been drawn up as a working basis in the hope that they may be of assistance to Committees, and comprise mainly the duty of considering the needs of their area as a whole and of concerting arrangements to meet those needs so far as the constituent Local Committees do not find that they can do so individually. In particular, it should be understood that it is not intended that a Joint Committee should deal with individual cases which can be dealt with satisfactorily by a Local Committee within its own area.Officers of the Joint Committee.A representative of the Ministry and of the Statutory Committee will be appointed as Inspector for the area of each Joint Committee. This Officer will act as Adviser and Organising Agent, and pray (with the consent of the Ministry), if the Joint Committee so desire, be appointed by them to act as their Honorary Secretary, But in any case the Joint Committee will be empowered to appoint a Clerk or Secretary of their own, whose salary up to  150 a year will be defrayed by the Ministry.I am to request that copies of all resolutions of conferences and of the constituent Local Committees in regard to the formation and powers of the Joint Committee may be forwarded to the Ministry of Pensions, Great George Street, S.W. 1.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,MATTHEW NATHAN,Secretary.
