J..(2) Dealings in Oats (Restriction) Order, 1917, dated May 14, 1917-This Order prohibits, as from.the .15th May, all dealings in. oats outside the United Kingdom excepting, those purchased for future shipment, or actually in transit. Persons having oats afloat, or unshipped purchases at the date of &apos; the. Order must furnish a return thereof before the 21st May. The object of the Order is to confer on the Oats Control Committee the sole power of - purchasing foreign oats. &quot; &apos; &apos; &apos;(3) Public Meals Order No. 2, 1917.. This: Order abolishes the meatless day in public Seating places imposed by the Order of April 4, and provides for a corresponding increase of the meat ration in such places. It further prescribes the percentages of flour and sugar to be reckoned in cakes, . buns, scones, biscuits, macaroons, and other like articles when they are not otherwise brought into account, and includes in-the definition of flour contained in the principal Order barley flour, barley meal, and maize -    &quot;... flour.   These last provisions come into force on the 20th May.(4) Beans, Peas, and Pulse (Requisition) Order, 1917, dated May 16, 1917. By : virtue of this Order the Food Controller takes over from the originalconsignees all beans, peas, and pulse suitable for human food which have -        -  arrived or hereafter shall arrive in the United Kingdom, except beans, :peas, and pulse which have already been sold by the consignees and paid -for by the purchasers, and except Burmah peas and beans already taken .: over by the Food Controller.   Contracts for sale made by the original consignees -except as mentioned above are cancelled.   Consignees are required on or before May 21 to furnish to the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies full particulars of all beans, peas, and pulse subject to this Order, and the Lord Chief Justice of England will appoint the arbitrator to determine, in default of agreement, the compensation to be paid for requisitioned stocks.&apos; Control of Prices, and Supplies. . -   ;Cereals. The Flour Mills Control Committee have decided to prohibit the forward selling of flour beyond 14 days, and of offalbe3&apos;ond one month. The enforced percentage of admixture from permitted cereals has been increased from 10 per cent, to 20 &quot;per cebt. as from May 28; -the limitation on the degree of admixture allowedA   (33)29rioi-3   Fk T&apos; &quot;50 &quot;5/17&quot;       S &quot;  &quot;------------------  &quot;    --------- A&apos;&quot;3l
has been raised from 25 per cent, to 50 per cent; A request lias been made that millers should extract&apos;a minimum of screenings only. ^&quot; - -The Wheat Commission have considered the question of the importation of oats for civilian horses, and have agreed to co-operate with the Oats Control Committee so far as concerns the provision of ocean freight.A telegram has been received by the Viee-Chairman of the Wheat Commission, now in the United States, with regard to the position of the Chicago Option Market. Mention was made in last week&apos;s Report of the arrangements made with the Winnipeg traders. It has now been suggested that as a step towards a comprehensive arrange-ment between Canada and the United States the Chicago Board of Trade should ascertain the actual position of the short and long interests. Mr. Anderson expresses the belief that the Royal Commission^ July holding represents but a small fraction of the total. .        :      , , .    - v.Fish. A new Committee has been set up for dealing with the supplies of cured fish in the United Kingdom, under the chairmanship of Sir Alfred Hopkinson, E.G; The Committee will sit for the first time on Tuesday&apos;next.Meat. In view of the serious advance in the wholesale and retail prices of meat, the Food Controller ha? communicated with the Butchers&apos; Federation and has invited the co-operation of the other Departments concerned for the purpose of regulating the prices and supplies of meat.Sugar.-During the week the only loss of sugar was one of a parcel of 1,800 tons, part of a general cargo, coming from Peru.The question of obtaining sugars from Java continues to occupy the attention of the Commission, and at its instance the Foreign Office has cabled to Washington suggesting that the whole subject of the sugar supply for all the Western Countries in the Alliance should be considered by the Food Committee in New York, presided over by Mr. Hoover, with a view to arranging for the largest possible measure of co-operation in the matter of purchases.Meanwhile the Shipping Controller has intimated that there is a prospect that he may be able to provide six ships at an early date for conveyance of sugars from Java. On the other hand warnings of increasing gravity reach the Commission in regard to the difficulty of financing operations in Java, so much so that it is given to understand that the time is approaching, if indeed it be not already reached, at which obligations to the Dutch may have to be met in gold.Rationing.The Committee appointed to prepare and submit for consideration a scale of bread rations have presented their Report. They recommend a graduated scale as follows: Class.	-&apos;.&apos;.&quot;                       Description:	Number in Class.	&apos; Broad and Flour Allowances &apos; per Head per Week in Terms of Bread.1	Men on heavy manual&apos; work (all men in agriculture and mercantile marine), and about 40 per cent, of &quot;industrial manual workers..                            &apos;.;  &apos;	3,650,000	Lbs. 8B.	Men on ordinary manual work (all manual workers not : in Class A.) Women on exceptionally heavy work. -   -:- /&apos;. -&apos;.	4,500,000	6c. :	Women on. manual work in industry.   . Women on domestic work in their own homes. Boys and girls,&quot; 13- 18.	11,000,000    &apos;	5	Men on sedentary work or unoccupied. Women on sedentary; work, or unoccupied.            / ,v Indoor domestic servants. :. Boys and girls, 10-13.. Children under 10i^j;/r:y.;:;.	23,850,000	4... .	---.-      f.......	.43,000,000 .	4-80
f- The. scale is expressed in terms of bread, hut&quot; is intended to cover-also all regulation flour&apos;used at trie rate of  lb. of flour for every lb. of bread. The rations in the scale have been generally,adjusted to the varying needs of the different.classes concerned, but the Committee suggest, that there must be a certain elasticity in. the bread ration as introduced and recommend that provision be made for&apos; further sales of bread either -without.tickets:; or.by&apos; supplementary tickets, up.-to a total, of 10 per cent, over the amount required to provide the specified rations. Otherwise there would have to be: an additional allowance &quot;for certain classes, of manual workers, especially agricultural labourers.       . ;- . &apos;.If the ration is to bo understood to cover all cereal foods,.the Committee point-put that it would be necessary to raise.the scale for each class, and suggest an addition of T lb. a week for each of the first three classes and of I lb. for the fourth class.They: further point out that a combination of bread and meat in a single ration allowing individuals to choose bread or meat at choice would have many advantages over a scale covering bread alone. In particular it would adjust automatically inequalities in the consumption of- bread and would allow for differences of purchasing power among the&apos; several classes of &quot;the community. They submit accordingly in an appendix a combined scale for this purpose.-----&apos;&apos;.   &quot;        -     - 1 -&apos;; -      Food Economy Campaign. -Munitions Works-A letter written by the Secretary of the Board of Management of 1I.M. Factory, Gretna, shows the effect of the propaganda undertaken among mxmition workers. It is stated that: &quot;The bread consumption for last week in the factory messrpoms was over 1,000 lbs. less than in the previous week.&quot;;. Lopal Food Control Committees. About a thousand have been set up; for the purposes .of the Food Economy Campaign. Many towns already-report a marked decrease in the consumption of foodstuffs. p-; - Pledge Card. -Two million copies of the King&apos;s Proclamation have been printed in1 the form of a pledge card for every family to sign. A record of households so pledged is being kept by each local committee.(Mitral Kitchens. A memorandum on central kitchens for the supply of cooked food with a view to economy in the use of foodstuffs has been issued by the National War Savings Committee. Central kitchens have been established in Bedford (two), Cambridge, Coventry; Oullompton, Dublin, Exeter, Hammersmith, Honley, Huiir stanton, Lambeth, Leeds (six\ Leicester, &apos; Ley ton,&quot; Marylebone, Ross (four), Ryde (Isle of Wight), St. John&apos;s Wood, Stepney (four), Tamworth (Rural), Westminster (Ministry of Food), and Windsor.The Local Government Board are addressiug local authorities on the subject. These kitchens will in the main be self-supporting.National Food Saving Day.-Empire Day (May 29th) this year is to be so called. Meetings furthering the Food Economy Campaign will be held in every part of the United Kingdom.       . ... - .-------   Economy Exhibitions.--Ninety-two are now being held in various towns,Enforcement of Orders. Load Authorities Poioers.-The Secretary for Scotland made an Order on the 12th May giving. Local Authorities in Scotland similar powers and duties to those already conferred on Local Authorities in England by the Order of the Local Govern-ment Board oL the 8th May.   The question of the extension of these powers to Irish Local Authorities has not yet&apos;been settled.   As a consequence of the Orders made by the Local Government Board and the Food Controller on the 8th May, and the Secretary for Scotland on the -12th May, reported contraventions of the following Orders are now generally referred to the Local Authorities concerned       -&quot;   - &apos;-:&apos; The Sugar (Confectionery) Order, 1917, &apos; The Cake and Pastry Order, 1917. vv:&apos;-:       The Wheat, Rye and Rice (Restriction) Grower, 1917, .... . -   -    The Maize, Barley and Oats (Restriction) Order, 1917,   -\   The Oat and Maize Products (Retail Prices) Order, 1917. Orders contravene^:-The &quot;first&quot; prosecution for waste of bread under the Wheat, Rye and-$ice (Restriction) Order, 1917, was undertaken at the request of the Ministry ,of Food onrtha 14th.&quot; May. at Bromley, Kent, and resulted in a sentence of a fine of hi. or six months, imprisonment in the second division.   -..- - &apos;        &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;.&quot;&quot;4 3    -
.The&apos; Orders&apos;most generally disregarded are still those governing&apos; the .sale of potatoes. The difficulty of enforcement arises from (1) the inadequacy of the fines; commonly inflicted, (2) the indifference of the police in some places to rather llagrant; contraventions, and (3) the difficulties of obtaining evidence owing to collusion&apos;between?. buyers and sellers. Notwithstanding this, a number of cases have been investigated and convictions have nearly always been obtained in cases where proceedings Were&quot;instituted. - - - -      j   &apos;. .&apos; -     - -     &apos; &quot;Contraventions of the Food (Conditions of Sale) Order, 1917&apos;, occasioned. ;by the imposition of illegal conditions on the sale of sugar-appear to be now- lessfrequent. The Order is generally known and a large number of prosecutions have succeeded.The Cake and Pastry Order, 1917, is not yet generally understood, and demands fox interpretations and&apos; rulings have been frequent. A notice as to the effect&apos;of the Order has, therefore, been issued from the Ministry for the guidance of tho BakeryTrade. , * ^   \ ;   - : -&apos;.; - &quot;., -      1. &apos; PART II-SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION.. :.&apos;.--&apos;&apos;.&apos;-.&apos;&quot;- .&apos;.     ;-&apos;.&quot;&apos;      &apos;     Imports..; b::.y^,Imports of food showed a great improvement in the week ended 12th May, the total quantity of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs imported (as.given in Table A.) rising to- 274,000. tons, compared with&apos;197,000 tons in the;preceding week, 195;500 tons in the corresponding vreek of last year, and Weekly averages of 200,500 tons and 225,000 tons in the first 19 weeks of 1917 and of 1916 respectively. &apos; , The articles mainly responsible for the increase are wheat (of which over 124,000 tons were received&apos;, compared with 92,000 tons in&apos;the previous week, and a weekly average of less than 93,000 tons since the beginning of the year), sugar and glucose (44,000 tons, compared with 15,500 tons in the previous week and a weekly average, of 23,000 tons- during, the present year),&apos; oats (nearly 28,000 tons, against 7,800 tons in the previous week, and an average of 6,700 tons), and.maize (-12,000 tons, compared with 35,000 tons in the previous week, and 34,500 tons as the average). The imports of wheaten flour, though somewhat smaller than-in the previous week, were also considerably above&apos; the&quot; average ; but there -were-marked decreases in imports of mutton, bacon, hams, lard, cheese, and butter. &apos; The imports of margarine were.:better than in recent weeks, but were still considerably below the &quot;average for the completed portion of. 1917. &apos;,&apos;The total imports of: fifteen of the principal foods and -feeding-stuffs since the beginning of the year now amount to nearly 3,811,000 tons, compared with 4,2.76,000; tons hi the corresponding period of 1916,.a reduction of 465,000 tons, or 11 per cent&apos;. A week ago the deficiency was 546,000 tons.   .   :&apos;. &quot;   v.v :vThe articles showing the greatest decreases are barley (168,000 tons), wheat (146,000 :tons), oats&apos; (131,000 &quot;tons), sugar (125,000&quot; tons), and whealen. flour (55,000 tons). There&quot; are also reductions in beef, mutton, and margarine: Maize, oh.the other hand, shows an increase of 152,000 tons, and the imports of cheese, butter and lard are also, substantially greater &quot;than in the same period of .19.16. The total quantity of bacon and hams imported is about the same as last year.Among the articles of food for which weekly figures are not available, rice showed a-further-fall in imports during April,, as compared with last year, and&apos; the total quantity received during the first four months of 1917 is only 44,000-tonsj against nearly 145,000 tons in . the corresponding period of 1916. This fall -in imports-is^ howeyer- in some degree compensated by a fall in re-exports of nearly 42,000 -tons, The -imports of oil-seeds, nuts and., kernels are also - smaller by 78,000 tons, but therg is an increase of 13,000 tonsin oil-seed cake, . ; - .-.&quot;&apos;.- .- -. - - &quot;- j     &apos;: &quot;V &quot;&apos;;...

There were reductions, as.compared with last year, of .13 .per cent, hi London, 10 per cent, at Glasgow, and&quot; 3 per cent, at Manchester.

The supplies of. fat cattle at 51 markets (Table (1), which had fallen heavily in the two previous weeks,, showed a:large-increase in. the week: ended .9th&apos;May, the total -number marketed being 22 per cent, above that for the preceding week, 10 per cent, above the average for April,.&quot;and 8 per cent, higher than the average for the corresponding-week in the years .1914-1.6.   :       .-/.&apos;.:;- :  -   :;-\../-/;&apos;::;The. supply of fat sheep continued small, the figures being little higher than those for the previous week, which were exceptionally low, and showing decreases of 16 per cent.-on the weekly average for April 1917, and of 23 per cent, on the average for the corresponding weeks of 1914-16.The number of fat pigs was rather greater than in the preceding week, and also greater thaii tlie weekly average for April, but was 8 per cent, below the average for the corresponding week.in the three previous years,, -I &quot;   &apos; Stocks of Cereals.--&quot;-&quot;Preliminary figures for farm-stocks on May 1st having been received from the Board of Agriculture and i Fisheries for England and Wales, the figures for total stocks have been revised accordingly. The estimates for wheat and barley were little affected, but the estimated stock of oats was appreciably increased. Relatively large imports of this cerealwere also recorded last week and the position-is thus rendered slightly more favourable.  The following are the actual figures:- &quot;i::Wheat.-7-Tho stocks on May 14th are estimated at. 1,078,00.0 tons as against 1,039,000 tons on May 7th, 1,159,000 tons a month, ago, and 1,402,000 tons on the corresponding date of 1916.-.&quot;Barley.-rnie stocks on May 14th are estimated at 389,000 tons as against 381,000 tons on May 7th and 425,000 tons a month ago.   - - &apos;.0ats.-r\.lio stocks on May 14th are estimated at 336,000 tons as against estimates of 270,000 tons on May 7th, and 403,000 tons a month ago. . --\Maize.-rTKe stocks on May 14th are estimated at 139,000 tons against 140,000 .ions on:May.7th, and 153,000 tons.a month.ago. .-. Wholesale Prices. - .       -;;.&apos;.&quot;.&quot; &quot;The latest available wholesale prices of food and feeding-stuffs (as given.in-Table. D) in most cases show little, if.any, alteration from those of the preceding week. Among the few changes which.. occurred, the outstanding increase was one of 24s, M. &quot;per cwt., or over 21^. per lbr, in the-price of - English mutton. Argentine chilled beef was also dearer by .8s. GcZ..per cwt. The only important reductions were in Calcutta linseed, which fell, from 35Z. to 30L per ton in London, and in tea, the prices- of which, at. the auctions, were lower, than in the previous week by 3d. &quot;to hd... per; lb. generally.. Allowing for the.proportion of &quot;controlled &quot; tea allocated direct to: buyers without&apos;passing&apos;through the sales, the average&apos; prices were about Is. Ad.&apos; per lb. for Indian.tea and Is. 3fcZ. for Ceylon tea, as compared with Is. Gd. and Is. Q^d. a week before.The principal changes in prices compared with a month ago are increases of 2!s. Qd. per cwt. (over 2kd. per lb.) in English mutton, 23s. to 53s. per ton in oil-seed cakes,, and 30s. per ton in palm kernels, and decreases of 19s. per cwt. (2d. per lb.) ,.in Argentine mutton, 13s. Qd. per cwt. (l^d. per lb.) in Danish butter, 7s. per cwt. in New Zealand butter,. 7s. 2d. per 480 lbs. in English wheat and 6s. llcZ. per 400 lbs. in English barley. There were also smaller increases in the prices of Irish and Canadian bacon, Canadian cheese, tea, and Egyptian cotton-seed, and decreases in Danish.bacon, British.oats, and English beef. Imported wheat, flour, rice, and sugar show no change..- .&apos; Compared with a year ago, the articles showing the greatest increase in prices are palm kernel cake (173s. per ton, or 114 per cent.), linseed cake (191s. per ton, or 76 per-cent.), linseed (204s, per ton^ or 52 per cent.), British oats (22s. Id. per 312 lb, or 67 per cent,), rice (9s. 9rf. per cwt., or 52 per cent.), and tea, the average sale price of which, even after allowing for the allocation of 40 per cent, direct to buyers at Is. per lb.,; was more; than 3d. per lb. above the high prices prevailing a year ago. Maize has risen, by 23s. per&quot; 480 lbs., or 44 per cent., British wheat by 22s. Id. per 480 lbs., or 41 per cent., and cheese by about 50s. per cwt., or nearly ..h\d. per lb. &quot;There are also considerable increases in flour, English mutton, bacon, and butter, and palm kernels.^ Apart from sugar, the price of which is practically unchanged, the articles showing least increase are Argentine mutton (8f per cent,), Argentine chilled beef (12 per cent.),&apos;andr British beef (13 per cent.).
