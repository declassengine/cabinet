if-Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.SECTION D.DRW/004.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA.. IV. May 18, 1917.The serious omission of the Jewish question from the list of questions to &quot;be discussed in Parliament with a view to reform - to which I drew attention in last week&apos;s Report (No. Ill) - has fortunately been rectified during the past few days.   It had caused intense discontent and disappointment among the Jewish population.    It is true that the Central Committee of Native Jews issued a manifesto declaring that they do not wish to add to Rumania1s difficulties by bringing forward their grievances during the war.   But in Odessa on May 13 there was a demonstration of protest in front of the Rumanian Consulate against Rumanian treatment of the Jews. Fortunately the Consul was able to inform the demonstrators&apos; delegates that he had just received a wire from Iasi stating that the whole Jewish Question would be dealt with in the present session of the Rumanian Parliament.

The King made a reassuring reply announcing his intention of seeing that &quot;All who have striven for the realisation of the aspirations which Rumanians have entertained for so many ages, by shedding their blood, by enduring the difficulties and sacrifices imposed by war and invasion, whether they are Christians, Jews of adherents of any other form of belief, will equally have a right to the gratitude of
the country and to that of the King, and will enjoy equal rights in a free, great and flourishing Rumania, closely united, all of uSj under the folds of the national flag&quot;.It is most earnestly to he hoped that Parliament will without delay translate these admirable premises into definite acts of enfranchisement.Rumanian Irredenta.I have no recent information from Transilvania.     pre-sumably the &quot;active measures to punish the traitors&quot; promised by Balogh, Hungarian Minister of Justice, on March 3 are being pushed on with.   There were then &quot;more than 1,000 persons in prison .... Nine public prosecutors with their staffs were at work and were co-operating with the Honv&amp;d Military Courts in Transilvania to clear up the many thousands of more or less important criminal cases and bring them before the competent Courts of Justice&quot;.     Mr Balogh may be relied on to keep his savage promise.In Bessarabia there is the beginning of a new movement. A &quot;Moldavian Movement&quot; has been initiated by the appointment of a Committee, and a Congress has been held at Kishinyov. The demands of this Congress include autonomy and full recognition of the &quot;Moldavian&quot; (i.e. Rumanian) language, but apparently the movement has not as yet a pan-Rumanian separatist character,A Rumanian Legion.I learn from Madame Goga (wife of the prominent Transil-vanian poet and irredentist leader, Octavian Goga), who is passing through London on her way to Prance, that Mr Goga himself has been in Kiyev organising a Rumanian Legion among
the Rumanian prisoners of war in Russia - similar to the Jugoslav and Cech Legions wjiich were formed there.    If he is successful Mr Goga should open the eyes of the Russian Socialists to the urgency of the Transilvanian Question, vThich they are inclined to deny.       A Congress of representatives of the various nationalities of Austria-Hungary is being held at present in Klyev and it is due toMr C-oga that the Rumans have been included in what wouldaotherwise be/purely Slav affair.A.W.A.L.May 18, 1917.
