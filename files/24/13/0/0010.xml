SECRETP.Prom:-   General &apos;?ilson.To:-      Sir William Robertson.11/5/17.     10.p,m.H.W.9. Secret and personal.   This af-ternoon I had a talk with General Petain.   He takes over the-superior direction of the army to-morrow, but whether as C, in C. or as Chief of Staff in Paris he said he was unable then to tell me.     I found him disinclined to accept the decisions which you thought had been reached at Paris without further examination and possibly modifi-c at ion..   It would appear that in future Haig would have to deal with Petain, as he made it clear to me that with him actually lay all the decisions.   Nivelle will, I imagine, be removed, but how and when I do not know.
SECRET.pc       Prom Colonel Leroy Lewis to C.I.G.S.11. 5. 1917. 11. 45 p.m.9416.     I am informed by Minister of War that it was arranged that Hivelie should resign this morning, but he declined to do so now.   Cabinet have not yet arrived at a decision what course to take.
