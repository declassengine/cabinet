STATinaBALTIC STATES.] Jffllfl &apos; MEWANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.In, cln^niktion of G.T. 8035, I circulate two papers by Sir Hubert Gough. 7;--4aie&apos;^^%&apos;&apos;Au -ust, on the subject of his Mission.&quot;3rd September, 1919. &apos; WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.From thdthree wires (attached)* it seems that some misunderstanding of a grave nature has arlen, and the intention is quite different from that which is envisaged in these wires.I beg tOjSxplain the situation more fully.I     1. Recognition of North- West Russian Government.This Government is not a fresh factor which has suddenly arisen. It is nothing more than tie administration of General Judenitch put on an organized basis.For thrje months or more this area of North-West Russia, about 250 miles long and 60 to 80 mi]3s broad, has been under the so-called administration of General Judenitch or his representative commanders.The administration, however, has been practically non-existent, and the civil Governmenj of the country has been totally neglected and chaotic. All that was being done was that scattered local military commanders, in a country devoid of telegraphs and all meats of communications, imposed their individual wills on the inhabitants.It had been long realized that this was only leading to the greatest discontent and alienating ine feelings of the people and the soldiers they provided, Irom sympathy with General Julenitch&apos;s views and aspiration to take Petrograd. Although these people are anti-Bolshevik, they are strongly radical and democratic, and were also suffering greatly from inefficient administration.If this &quot;area of Russia was to be rescued from Bolshevism it had been apparent for some time that steps must be taken to reorganize the administration on a democratic basis.The Esthonians also pomted out very clearly&apos;the necessity of this.The reorganization (called for want of a better name the North-West Russian Government) wis nothing more than the outcome of the pressure of these facts, and was decided on by.the Russians themselves, General Judenitch assenting and taking his share as Minister of War. The final conference, in which this was decided, was attended by all the representatives of the Allies, the British representative presiding. This was done because both the Russians and Esthonians desired our attendance and approval.As far as our approval is concerned, I unhesitatingly did and do approve of the action. If it was desired to establish an efficient Russian administration, this reorganization should have been carried into effect two months earlier. \The political and military situation, rendered extremely critical largely owing to the inefficiency, one might even say complete absence, of proper civil administration in this area imperatively demanded it. It was, and is, a Russian Government, created by Russians.Under such circumstances, 1 cannot see or admit that I was guilty of any &quot; momentous action.&quot; without authority from His Majesty&apos;s Government. I could not do less than ask the British Government to recognize this necessary and wise act of the Russians. If the British Government do not wish to do so, it is, of course, their right to take what action they judge wise, but that their representatives did wrong.in asking for this recognition I must respectfully deny. That the Russians now break up this organized; administration and go back to the personal and chaotic rule of General Judenitch, is, however, doubtful. The military debacle, foreshadowed by the capture of Pskoff, the possibility of which I foresaw and reported, seems now approaching. It is probable, therefore, that any kind of Russian Government except that of the Bolsheviks and those of the Baltic Border States will vanish from Noroh-West Russia.Note.-Whether these two governments will make peace with each other remains to be seen. Nor,can I say how His Majesty&apos;s Government will regard such an eventuality.* See Appendix.. (B19/400)  70  9/19  H&amp;S  7463wo
2. &quot; Recognition of complete independence of Esthonia and communication to Russian . -Political Conference and Admiral iKolehqk with a view to 4hei\ taking similar action,&quot;This again is an act by General Judenitch personally, supports by his newly organized Government. No such recognition was admitted by me personally or by any representative of the Allied and Associated Powers.Our action was confined to submitting the information and the request to our Governments we could not have done otherwise. As regards my personal views on this subject, I would like to state that, putting aside all question of tlje rights of the Esthonians to self-government, the military situation of the Russian North-West Corps, was so desperate that not only was any hope of capturing Petrograd, without assistance, a mere illusion, but even their continued iexistence was doubtful witjjout Esthonian co-operation. The Esthonians very naturally are not willing to spendfcheir blood and small resources in fighting for Russia without any consideration of th^r own future, and in fact with the serious probability of the Russians, as soon as they lad recaptured Petrograd and established themselves there, turning their attentioi to crushing Esthonia as the next step in their programme, a threat which many Russians in high places had frequently made.If the anti-Bolshevik Russian was to save Petrograd and thus to make a step towards the reconstitution of old Russia, it was essential to have the militpy aid of the Esthonians. But ,this aid would under no circumstances be given unlels Russia was prepared to make sacrifices. I ,\General Judenitch considered that it was necessary and wise to^ make these sacrifices. He wrote a letter to the Esthonian Government on his own initiative, making this concession as far as his own authority permitted and offeringjhis personal support to the proposal, and demanding in return certain military conditions, all which have been fully explained and copies sent to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff previously.At the two conferences between Esthonians, Russians and Allies, this matter was discussed and the agreement of the Russians present (General Judenitch) noted. The Esthonians made a very half-hearted consent to help the Russians by military means, but asked the Allied representatives to transmit to their Governments trie fact that they did not consider the consent of General Judenitch sufficient, but alsp; asked for recognition by the Allies before undertaking any active operations. jFrom this it is clear that the recognition of the independence of Esthoni^ was only assented to by General Judenitch and that entirely on his own initiative. iThat the military situation forced him to this is beside the point. It did. The action !of myself and Allied representatives was entirely confined to forwarding to. our respective Governments the fact of General Judenitch&apos;s consent, his further request thai Admiralrequest of the the Allied andKolchak and Russian Political Conference should be informed, and the Esthonian Government for their recognition as an independent state by Associated Powers.Again I must respectfully repeat that I cannot see what other action I could have taken and that I cannot admit that this is in any way &quot;momentous action.&quot;3. Guarantee of issue of Rouble Notes and financial assistance to the North-WestRussian Government.No such guarantee was given by me or any Allied or British representative, nor can I see anything in any telegram sent which 1 have seen which justifies such a conclusion.But this Russian Government must have money if it is to carry on. That is beyond dispute.The suggestion for obtaining this money was put forward by the North-West Russian Government and transmitted to the Foreign Office by Colonel Pirie Gordon. Personally, I did not enter any details of this matter and did not know what proposals Colonel Pirie Gordon put forward.But whether these proposals were sound or not I am convinced that Colonel Pirie Gordon only put them forward to His Majesty&apos;s Government as proposals and gave no guarantee whatever.The &quot;matter is so urgent, however, if this part of Russia is to be re-established and if any hope whatever of saving Petrograd is to be entertained that a purely private body, the Inter-National Relief Committee, is considering it; and will put forward proposals to the Russians shortly.   A representative of theirs is now in London.   If
these proposals materialize, the financial situation of the Russians will be secured without any Government responsibility, provided of course that there remain any organized Russians to undertake the advance-e on Petrograd after the loss of Pskoff.I hope these somewhat full explanations of the situation are sufficiently clear and that the misapprehensions that seems to exist will be removed.My action throughout has been to carry out the policy of the Government and to maintain British prestige and interests while endeavouring to secure liberty, justice and peace for the various people with whom I was required to deal.II.The Russian Baltic Situation.The factors that affect political and military affairs in this part of the world are the following: Along the Baltic seaboard are people who are entirely different in race from the Russians or the Germans. These are Lithuanians, Letts and Esthonians, and on the north of the Gulf of Finland are the Finns.The question of race south of the Gulf is complicated to a certain extent, however, by the presence of a rich German aristocratic land-owning class, known as the Baltic Barons.   These are the remains of German conquests many centuries ago.The Baltic Barons and Baits, although they possess the great proportion of the land and riches, and up to the war most of the political power, are numerically a very small proportion of the people less, I believe I am correct in saying, than 5 per cent, of the population.The Lithuanians, Letts and Esthonians hate both the Russians and the Germans, and they do so for much the same reason, namely, both are tyrannical in their methods of government, and both deny all political liberty or opportunity for self-development to the local people, and both represent a strong class domination of the aristocracy.To both Russians and Germans, however, the Baltic Barons and Baits are attached, as from these powers they expect to retain all their own great political and economic privileges. At the present time, owing to the Russians not being in any condition to support them, the Baits have thrown in their interests entirely with the Germans, and they have been led to do this by the presence and rule of German troops undisturbed in the country up to the present moment, added to which the workings of very active German propaganda must not be forgotten. This propaganda easily influences the Baltic Barons, for although they represent a certain standard of culture, it is culture which is very much in the direction of luxury and extravagance. Their mental equipment does not go much further than speaking several languages well; in political knowledge and sound judgment they are merely children.The next two great factors bearing on the Baltic situation are Russia and Germany.For the moment, the German plan to colonize these Border States and establish a dominating influence has been.threatened with failure by our action in Latvia, and by the retirement from the country of the German troops, now being carried out. (Latest information does not confirm this.)The Germans are carrying out an active propaganda, which has its influence on these easily-swayed peoples. There is a large section of the old Russians who are struggling energetically to restore the old boundaries of Russia intact, and with it their own power. They violently oppose ideas of autonomy of the local. Baltic States, much more so do they oppose any idea of independence; feeling that the Entente favour these Border States, there is a great possibility of their calling in German aid to re-establish old Russia. There are signs that intrigues in this direction have already begun.Much will depend on what the future of Germany is going to be. Is it going to be Germany genuinely democratic, or are the Junkers and military caste again going to seize the power&apos;? They undoubtedly intend to try. Should they succeed,-they will support a monarchic and autocratic form of Government in Russia and make an alliance with it;, one of their first steps will be to bring under a Russo-German domination the whole of the Baltic States, and from this threat even Finland will not be secure. Should a really democratic and peace-loving Germany arise, the danger will not be so great, but it is probable that under any circumstances a strong commercial penetration of Russia will take place, and this will be tolerated and encouraged by the Russians themselves.The only people who will not easily fall under the influence of the Germans or the Russians are the people of the Baltic Provinces.   They hate and mistrust both too(7463)
much. It will be necessary, however, for us to support these people commercially and politically if they are to withstand the German-Russian pressure. With our command of the sea, and by using to the full the excellent ports of Libau, Riga, Reval and Helsingfors, it should not be difficult for us to maintain a powerful political and commercial control along the Baltic.Such close and effective support by England in particular, and the Allies generally, will tend to the development, happiness, self-government and general progress of these Baltic States.   But it may involve us in hostility of Russia and Germany.Another possibility which should be foreseen is that the present attempt of what may be called White Russia to regain power in Russia from the Bolsheviks may fail. In that case, whatever alterations the Bolshevik Government may assume, it is likely to recognize the independence of all these Baltic States. In fact, the Bolshevik Government is prepared, I believe, to do so now as the price of peace.That being so, it seems that an inevitable pressure of circumstances, as well as the desires for freedom growing up in the world, will almost force the decision that these States will be independent of both Russia and Germany. But if so, a collection of small and wholly independent States may be a menace to themselves and to the world on account of their clashing interests.The present Governments of these States are aware of this danger and realize the importance of the adage that Unity makes force. They are already consulting each other in regard to alliances.It would not be difficult to create a confederation of these States perhaps even a federation and it seems that whatever the future of Russia may be, this is the inevitable and the wisest direction of policy to take in regard to the immediate future as regards Russia.It seems that the future lies between a democratic Russia which will ensure the full autonomy, if not complete independence, of all the Baltic Provinces, and a reactionary Russia allied to Germany, which will crush all their aspirations.In considering these grave and difficult problems, much depends on the power Germany may still possess. To aid Russia to destroy Bolshevism and reconquer all her old territory, Germany must give Russia support in men, materials and finance, which will make heavy calls on her resources. Can she do it ? It does not seem as long as the Allied and Associated Powers hold closely together and the terms of the Peace Treaty, especially in regard to their military and maritime conditions, are strictly enforced that Germany is in any position to effectually assist Russia. She may promise much, use an active propaganda and much intrigue, but her possibilities of action will be almost nil.On the other hand, any weakening of the bonds that bind France, America and ourselves together, opens possibilities in this direction, which may bring about very dangerous consequences.If the Allies and Associated Powers remain firmly united and the Peace Treaty is enforced, it does not seem that an &quot;Old White Russia&quot; can expect much, if any, support from Germany.Meanwhile, we may&apos; continue to support a democratic Russia which will at least accord self-Government to the Baltic States, and until such a Russia can be formed, which may be a matter of years, the development, political and commercial, of the border states can be fostered and encouraged, even to the extent of their forming an alliance and confederation among themselves.The choice in framing our policy in Russia seems to be between supporting an Old White Russian party, with all their claims to re-establish the old Russian boundaries,, and so turning them to the Allies for assistance rather than Germany (But this will alienate the friendship and good will of the border states completely, will destroy their faith in British professions of liberty and will render the military situation of the Russians as regards the capture of Petrograd a great deal more difficult)-and supporting a more democratic Russia which is willing to accord self-Government to-all Border States,1 if not even full independence, thus ensuring all their military co-operation in the capture of Petrograd and leaving it to the future to work out the eventual, confederation or federation of all Russia.It is the choice between these policies that I would respectfully beg His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider, and would ask for instructions in this respect for future-guidance.
