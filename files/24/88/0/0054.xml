T.8183. ) I desire to draw special attention to this very important note.(intld.)   A.C.Treasury,   S. /. ; Uth September, 1919.The Minister of Transport proposes during the nozt few days.to recommend for the approval of the Cabinet the purchase by the Minister of privately $?mod Hcilway \agone.    Tho purchase, if approved, will involve a large sum of money.)   A proximate figures have been prepared by Officers of the Transport Ministry indicating that 640,000 Wagons of an average age of 15 years priced at prosent day prices, less depreciation, would cost abriut  72,000,00b.  1 if tub s.:menumber of \/wagons of the sdme age were jjurohosea on ttie basis of ftre^war or poat pride, less depreciation, the sum involved would amount&apos; to 25,OOQvdoo or a differonoe of  47,000,000;   almost the whole of this difference would     in the light of present information  reprosoat profit to the &quot;?agon ownersIn approaching this matter I submit that tho purchase cannot bo regarded as an ordinary commercial transaction in which there is a willing buyer and a seller endeavouring to obtain a good price for his wares, nor can present day prices form a basis for tho transaction.    Tho necessity for the purchase Is national and for the oommbn good and service of the Country;   therefore, the owners are , entitled to receive only proper and fair proteotion for their in-vestment plus any expenses incurred in completing the transaction. Cost less depreciation is the only starting point to arrive at a fair and erultable return for tho investment made.    A few additional reasons for this opinion are cs follows:-The Minister in case he purchases any privately owned Wagons is compelled by tho Transport Bill to purchase all wagons for the conveyance of any particular class of traffic &apos; le therefore takes . good and bad no mctter what the oapaclty or suitability for economic ,: or efficient operation.    The owners by such purchase would be relieved of such part of their stock as in the near future may be completely obsolete.    In this connexion the Transport Ministry Staff are unanimously of the opinion that for economic management a wagon of a greater capacity more or less standardised is whet should be aimed at,    It cannot therefore be claimed by the owners that they arc selling stock most suitable for the Ministryrs requirements.
E The c- nor a ci ..rivctely owned % ens &amp;r   in the - in interestedin wagons only as a means of distributing their products and not es bunders for sale.   U^or vie Act tie Hi a- ter Uihe purchaser must afford all reasonable facilities to the owners including 4lo replacement by suitable wagons for trading in the class purchase a.-, The cvvsers arc net therefore damaged by the purcheso and will not suffer loss in this respect,3. If the itr^e majvrity of We ons vere *urcha8ed 0?- the Govern-TooTit it Tetsont day Alices, and on the basis of the average age of wagons estimated at 15 years - an o^ner if he sold at these -  prices would realize a profit on his original investment of 175$.4, In the ccse oi V,Y on fin.- *cc Gormnios tha co:.i eHeon of profit to the ordinary shareholder would be much more startling. Tho pcacroX raethod ci thoi* Fiunce (eoo parnhlet issued by them) is to raise 5/6ths of their capital on Debenture snd l/6th by -$hares&apos;.   Assuming that the present depreciated value of a wagon purchase-.&apos; pre-war is now  40 and of the same class of wagon at present day prices also depreciated is  114.if the wagon were sold at the latter price and the Debenture paid off, the Shareholder from the balance remaining would receive his money back at par plus over llOO$ Profit.5. The present dey price of a wagon is not a proper criterionof value.   The high price is the result of the war and shortage of material and shortage of wagons.   Prices are inflated end profit included in the orice is proportionately higher.6.    &apos;       It may no doubt argued that an intermediate price should be -arrived s*., but I see no justification in fixing any rate of profit, The Defence of the Pealm regulations only, contemplated compensa-tion based on the price ;eid plus a rate of profit usually earned in the business.   Further it seems doubtful whether Mfa&amp;iv, owned by Collieries end others- can be said to have been acquired in the usual course of business, by this I understand acquired for sale.7.     &apos;      In view of the necessity to increase rates of carriage to meet the Government guarantee or additional fixed charges^ it should be the object.of the Ministry of Transport to keep at a minimum the fixed charges of the Kailroads such as loan interest * If the percentage of rate increase   is considerable it may be labour will demand additional wages as their share of the increase.8. The general credit of the Railways must be conserved end the-ourchase of wagons at -oresont day prices would, I think, consider-ably affect this.9. In the unlikely event of. the Railway owned wagons being&apos;alsopurchased by the Ministry, cost less dopro^british^c saint n*uesa r-LT&quot; follow.( 3d.)   &amp;rdman Lever.s It is the public who will be asked to pay a return on the loan through the rates.
