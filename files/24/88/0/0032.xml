TOfrOy MILITARY HUTS &apos;PQR, CXYlfclAlT. &apos;.yQHKFBB*(Memorandum by the Minister&quot;of Health and ,the Minister.of Munitions.I. we have carefully considered the question of the hiring to local authorities of huts required by them for conversion into temporary working-class dwellings.   The Home Affairs Committee have already decided that huts may be sold at a discount of 33 1/3$ to local authorities for housing schemes and schemes for the treatment of tuberculosis and that the Minister of Health should stand temporarily possessed of all hostels which he considers it desirable to hire to local authorities for housing purposes.The expenditure necessary to convert an Army Hut into a satisfactory dwelling for a family is high compared with the value of the hut and from a financial,point of view it would certainly be.preferable that, instead of hiring, local authorities should purchase outright and use the huts for a period commensurate with their effective life.   The hiring of huts also involves somettiat complicated arrangements both in regard&quot;to the acquisition of the site and the valuation and final disposal of the property. -We do not think that hiring should be entertained except in cases Where the huts can be used in situ and where the Ministry of Health are satisfied that as an emergency measure the hiring and conversion of huts should be permitted.We understand that there are a number of local authorities faced with a situation in which torpostpone the provision of housing accommodation until permanent schemes have been com-..pleted, or to undertake a temporary echeme having any appearance of being intended to be maintained after the completion of the permanent scheme, might lead to serious difficulty.  We consider that in such cases, if a suitable qamp exists and can be made available the hiring of huts for use In situ should be allowed.II. The question has been discussed by representatives of our departments and if the proposal to hire huts can be approved we suggest that the following conditions should apply.(1)   The acquisition of an interest in the site including        , liability for reinstatement should be a question for settlement between the owner and the local authority, except where the terms    4 under which the land is held permit of the interest being trans-ferred from one Department to another.   It is understood that no powers exist under which the Department being in occupation of land under can transfer the land to another department for purposes mother than those defined by D.0.R-.A.in cases in which the local authority desire to acquire the freehold of a site it m$y be desirable for the Government Department concerned to exercise their powers of purchase under section 3 of the D..Q.R.A.   (Acquisition at Land) A*t, 1915 and for the local authority to purchase from them.(2)   The local authority will assume the liability for re* inatatement if land is rented and will agree a lamp sum with the Government Department concerned to cover this, equal to the estimated sum which the Department would have been liable to pay under the original terms of occupation.   Any further sum ultimately-found to be due to the owner by reason of the localauthority1e occupation of the huts will be paid by the local authority.
(3)   The Minister of Health will have temporary possession on behalf of the Crown of the huts of which he.proposes to sanction the use &quot;by local authorities for housing purposes, and will hire then to the local authorities at a rental based on a valuation which will be settled by,the Disposal. Board and the rents to be received by the Local authority from their tenants; the local authority will be responsible for maintenance.(4)   At the end of the lease the huts should revert to the Disposal Board for sale.   The Government account should receive the total proceeds of the sale if they are equal to or less than two-thirds: of the value of the huts at the time of the original lease to the local authority, thus allowing for the 33 1/3 percent discount allowed to local authorities when purchasing huts.   Any balance there may. be after the. amount due to the Government account has been paid, should be credited to the housing account of the local authority.
