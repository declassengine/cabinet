France&apos;s title can therefore be made subject to any, conditions which the Allied and Associated Powers choose to impose.   The British requirements as to the construction of a railway line and a pipe line should therefore take the form of liberties reserved for Great Britain by the Allied and Associated Powers at the tine when they confer the mandate upon France; and the acceptance of these privileges for Great Britain would be imposed upon France as ji con-dition of the mandate conferred upon her.The Arab State has not yet heen recognised and con-ditions can in the sane way be imposed upon that State at the time of recognitionsThe use of the railway and the pipe line in tine of war for the conveyance of troops, stores and oil will take place in virtue of a servitude created by the Powers and irrespective of the wishes and of the liberty of action of the French Government and of the Arab State.   No question therefore of neutrality arises.   The obligations of neutral-ity cannot compel a State to take action which is beyond its powers9CSigned)a J .B i? iIUR - &apos; T nSeptember 19th,1919.
