The Weather and Condition of Crops.The weather has been stormy*    Very heavy showers and high old winds were experienced throughout the country with almost continuous ain in some districts.    In lorkohire standing corn and fruit trees were considerably damagedj hut there are no reports of damage from other istricts.Although conditions have been unfavourable for the harvest, a air amount of corn has boon cut, though very little has been stacked.   In ome cases oats have begun to grow in the shock; but as a rule this has leen prevented by the cold wincURoots and pastures have Improved considerably.Lftal.

This Estate comprises 6,542 acres and it is proposed to purchase It in consideration of an&apos;annual rent charge.   Possession of part of the proper^! will be obtained at April next and further potions will come into possess&apos; Ion each year, possession of the bulk of the instate being obtained by 1929 In these ciraumstances an increasing rent charge has been arranged, the first yearly payment being  15,500, rising to  18,500 in the tenth and subsequent years.   This Estate comprises some of the best agricultural land in the country and the whole- of it is suitable for subdivision Into small holdings.This purchase will bring the total auea of land acquired by the Board under the Small Holding Colonies Acts, 1916 and 1918 up,to 24,468 acres.   The total area of land administered by the Board, including the Estate of 757 acres at Bosbury given by Mr. Buchanan, is therefore 26,225 acres.Schemes for the Development of Kiimington. KinsonI Berwick St. James,   and Tltohfield farm Settlements have been forwarded to&apos; the Treasury during the week.   They are briefly as follows:-KILMIWGTQNt    This Farm Settlement, will be managed by the Wilts. County Council on behalf of the Board and the Council propose to sub-divide the land into eight small holdings,of from 35 to 50 acres in extent to.be devoted mainly to milk production.    Eight ex-Service men have already beei selected as tenants and will enter on their holdings at Michaelmas.   The sub-division of the land has been so arranged as to permit ef existing houses and buildings being utilised for the tenants of six of the holdings&apos;, leaving only two cottages and two sets of farm buildings to be built.   The Estimated loss on the scheme is  115 per annum, that Is 4^4d. per acre*KIjSON.    This land has been purchased speoially for the settlement of aBouT&quot;20 men discharge^ from the Army as tuberculous who, having received hospital and sanatorium treatment, have been trained in agriculture by the Y.M.C.A. at the Kinson Colony, near Bournemouth.   Eleven ftf the men have now completed 12 months1straining and are capable cf taking up, under supervision small holdings of from two to ten acres in extent.   The Y.M.CJ have undertaken to find the capital required by the men for the purpose of stocking their holdings and they will continue their Training Centre and wply all the assistance, i.e. supervision, loan of horses, implement! etc., required by the men in the menagement of their holdings.   It is proposed to erect eleven new cottages for the small holders who will continue to live at the Training Centre until the cottages are ready for occupation.
Berwick St, James*     This settlement will be farmed as a whole&apos; on the profit&quot; sharing system, as it is not suitable for Bub-divisioh into small holdingst but is likely to be highly successful if farmed extensively.     The property has been acquired on exceptionally favourable terms and is capable of considerable improvement.     About 35 settlers can be provided for. As    in the case of other Settlements, a loss on the Estate, Account is inevitable, but ;.it is expected thai this will oe more than counter-balanced by the share- of the Board in the profits made on the farming operations.     It is proposed to erect six new cottages in the first instance.Titchfield.     A considerable area of this Estate is suitable for sub-division into market garden or small dairy holdings and it is proposed ultimately to increase the number of market gardens on this  state from 80, as at present, to about 200.     The Board will retain about 200 acres as a Central Farm.     The estate includes 255 acres &amp;f woodlands and the majority of this land, when cleared, can be devoted to the growth of strawberries and other market garden crops.     The Board intend to commence the clearing of the woodlands at once and to make at Titchfield the posts, rails, field gates, etc, required for the new fencing necessary at the various Farm Settlements the Board have in hand.     It is proposed to erect 12 new cottages at this Settlement at once,    A loss will be incurred on the scheme during the first year or two, but as more land is let off for small holdings, the rental will show a considerable increase.     On the other hand, additional oottagea may have to be provided at a later date.An additional six ex-Service men have commenced work at the Farm Settlements during the week, bringing the total number of such men now at the Settlements up to 232, namely, 59 settlers, 139 probationers, and 34 men working as wage-earners.     In addition 25 men have been accepted as settlers jot probationers, but have not yet started work.The recently appointed Directors of the new Settlements at Titchfield and Tantage, of which possession will be obtained at Michaelmas next, took up their duties during the week.The reports received from the Direators show that at all the Settlements the unsettled weather has delayed the work of gathering the harvest, but no serious damage has so far been caused.     A commencement has now been made with the harvest at Patrington but as yet there has been little progress.     About half the area under corn crops at Ho lbeach has been cut and some of the remaining crops are getting laid.     The settlers are busy , marketing their potatoes.     Arrangements have been made during the week to purchase in bulk the fruit trees and bushes required by the settlers for planting on their holdings this year.     The potato crop at Pembrey is realising about four tons per acre and the produce is selling readily in the district at  12 per ton. Pour additional probationers have commenced work at Afoeabury during the week.
ii (&amp;)   Work of the Agricultural Executive Committees. ,Aerodromes on Agricultural Land.    On the   5th July, 1919 the West Sussex A.321,0 &quot;served a notice on the Secretary of the County Aerial Club requiring him to cultivate part of a 16 acre field which is at present uncultivated.     The object of the Order was to prevent the land from being seeded down to grass ano) used with the adjoining pasture for a tfiying Ground with Tennis, Polo and Golf ground.     The Aero Club objected very strong to the Order which they stated would interfere with their business-to an extent which might seriously cripple their enterprise.    &apos; n inspection of the land was made by the Soard&apos;B Sub-Commissioner, who reported that the land in question was now derelict.     The land would have to &quot;be laid down to grass before it could be used as a landing ground for aeroplanes, and it was the intention of the Club to clean the arable land before planting with grass seeds. As insistence on compliance with the Order might result in a heavy claim for compensation from the Aero Club, the Board informed the&apos; A.&amp;.C. that provided the Club will give a written undertaking to refrain from laying down to grass any arable land which is not, in the opinion of the Committee^ in a fit state to be relaid by reason cf its foul condition, the! Cultivation Order should be withdrawn.Determination of Tenancies.     Up to date, 769 tenancies have been determined by Order of the Beard under Regulation 2K, covering an aggregate of 57,892 acres.&apos; During the week an Order was issued determining the tenancy of 70 acres of land in Wiltshire.     The farm was inspected by the Board1s District Commissioner, who reported that it was In a very bad state.     The crop of hay was poor and had been left so late that it had burnt brown where it grew.     The   arable land was in a foul state with matted couch and weeds.    As this is not a farm which can be cultivated in the vanter months, and as it would be impossible to gain possession before the autumn if the tenant exercised his right of appeal, it was suggested to the Cemmittee that the tenant should be served with a further Cultivation Order and warned that unless there was an improvement in the cultivation the Board would exercise their powers.    The Committee, however, were unanimously of opinion that nothing short of immediate determination of the tenancy would meet the case and it was decided to aooede to their application.Laying of Land to Grass.    A letter has been reoeived from the Workers&apos; Union, asking that some action should be taken to prevent farmers from laying down their land to grass at the present time.I In reply the Board have stated that they are entirely in agreement with the view that it is desirable in the national interests that&apos; the existing aoreage of arable land should be maintained at far as possible.    Farmers cannot, however, be compelled under peace conditions to farm their land at a loss, and their ability to continue arable farming profitably depends partly on prices of produce and partly on the wages and efficiency of labour, over which matters farmers themselves have no control.     It is expected that the Report of the Commission now sitting will throw considerable light on the question.Land Speculation.    An example of the injurious effects of the operations of Land Syndicates occurred reoently in Somerset. One farm of 64 acreB was bought by the Syndicate for  2,825 and re-sold within about 2 months for  3,200;   the tenant is under notice to quit at Ladyday 1920, and intends to sell all his dairy stock at Michaelmas as he has not yet found another farm.     In another instance the Syndicate bought the farm for  7,600, the
tenant himself &quot;being an unsuccessful bidder, and subsequently sold part of it for  2,410, and disposed of the remainder to the tenant for  6,250, thus scoring i profit of over  1,000 within about 2 months.     Shortly after the sale the tenant sold practically the whole of his dai.*y herd whioh it had taken him 16 years to build up, and there will be practically no milk produced for sale from this farm for about a year.Securitjt$fjcsnure*     In connection with the preceding paragraphrit may^be&quot;&quot;&apos;no&quot;ted that the Agricultural Land Sales (Restriction of STitices to Quit) Act, 1919, became Law cn the 19th August, 1919,     The effect of the Act is that, except by agreement with the occupier, the tenancy of an agricultural holding which passes by sals to a new ow^er, cannot be terminated by a ITotice to Quit served prior to the making of the contract of sale and then current and unexpired,     Tenant farmers whose land is sold over their heads are, therefore, assured of haying a considerably longer period within which to make their arrangements than was the case prior to the passing of this Act.(b)   Glebe Lands Act,.1888.The following statement gives full particulars of the applications for the Board&apos;s approval to sales under the above Act:-Applications   Acreage    Sales      Acreage received ApprovedAnnual average., for 4 years 1910-1913 Annual average for 4 years 1914-1917 Year 1918 1919Week ending 30th August, 191935 weeks period ending 30th August, 191981	2,570	79	1,89682 252	3,769 22,960	78 201	2,515 14,0039	899	12	1,278299	24,703	217	15,106iii   Land Drainage.HunUngdjn..__River Puss.     The wark being done by the 3xecutiveCommittee on the main river&quot;*and tributaries between Bluntisham and St. Heote is approaching completion, and by concentrating prisoners on the worst sections of the river substantial results have been secured.     If prisoner labour is available till the end of September all the improvements which have been taken in hand on this secfcrr should be completed.     The following is a summary of the work already-drone.-On the maln^riyer2 miles of banks restored at Bluntisham; 1  miles of chancel- cleared above Huntingdon Bridge;   and 1\ miles of backwater cleared between Houghton and Godmanchester.On the Tributaries (approximate lengths).

The Hertfordshire County Council are preparing a petition that the Thame and its tributaries in Hertfordshire may be included in the district.Qrders.    During the month of August further progress was made with oertain Orders under the Land Drainage Act, 1918.One Order was confirmed, viz:-   Sinfin ?&apos;oor Commissioners, Derby.- Increasing the rating powers of the Commissioners.

A portion comprising la.&quot;3r. Op. of the practice ground of the Hurlingham Polo Club was entered upon by the Council for allotments.     This portion will require returfing, as   .if it was seeded down it would not be fit to play on for two or three years, and then it would not be firm enough for the ponies to gaJlop on safely;   also the grass would not be firmly rooted for some years.     The cost of this returfing will amount to&quot; over  400, and as there seems no doubt that the Club could recover even   greater compensation if thsy went to arbitration, the Board have agreed to^ftccept the liability.The Council also entered on 2a. 3r. Op. ef land surrounding the Polo Ground No. 2, but in this case the Club have agreed that seeding down will answer their purpose, the cost of which will be-about  30.v*   Tithe, Commona, Copyhold and Survey.About 250 cases of the voluntary redemption of tithe rentchargeo payable on the lot October and 1st A&apos;jpril are in hand, and every effort is being male to complete as many of these as possible during the present moafch, in order that no further portions of the annual rentcharge may accrue after those due on the 1st prox,     Special attention is being paid to cased where large amounts of rentcharge are involved.Applications for enfranchisement of copyhold3, or of lando subject to manorial incidents, received during the eight months ending 31st August this year, total 197, as compared with 143,1-321 113 and 112 during the corresponding months of the years from 1911 to 1914 respectively, and with 173 during the whole of 1918,The number of Orders issued to the public for the inspection of various documents in the custody of the Board for the month of August 1919, as compared with the same month for the   two preceding years, was:-     1917, 105;   1918, 176; 1919, 285.On the 28th ult. the Board sealed their approval of e rate of l/3d.   per common right to be levied by the Conservators of Skip^orth Common, Yorku, upon the respective owners of common rights over the said Common, in order to meet the expenses incurred by the said Conservators for the year ended the 31ot December last.

During the past season some 2,500 seed firms havo been visited, many on two and throe occasions, in connection with the administration of the Order.   Nearly 1700 samples of soed were drawn from bulk, and, in addition, some 2200 small packets of seed were obtained.   All those samples have been tested at the Official Station and in the case of 90 of tho bulk samples the sellers&apos; Declaration as to percentage of germination, purity etc. was found to be radically wrong.   Tho seedsman   . concerned has boun written to in each of those cases, with tho result that the seed in question has either been withdrawn from sale, the bulk returned to the wholesaler, or the Declaration corrected to correspond with the Official figures.County.

In view of the undertaking that the Order would not he administered in a penal fashio n during the first year or two, no prosecutions have teen i^.dF.rtakon, &quot;but It is believed that the aotion taJrer. in drariirg att.cijti.cn to breaches of the Order has in most cases had tho desired effect.    There is evidenoe to show that the Order is causing a general levelling up of the quality of seeds sold, aid that it has driven off the market large quantities of low grade seed quite unsuitable for sowing.^P lOL.^ Ooi&apos;.?toes.    The supply of first early potatoes immune to&apos;WaiT&apos;Hscase&quot;has&quot;Xn the pact been much smaller than the demand.     In order to inorease the supply arrangements have been made.for a quantity of seed of the variety &quot;Dargill Early&quot; to be grown in Scotland on the Board&apos;s behalf.    This seed will be available for distribution at an early date through a Scottish firm of eeed merchants.,inspection of Growing Crops.   Applications have been received up to date for the inspection of a total area of 6240 acres of gnawing crops - of seed potatoes of varieties immune to wart disease.Official certificates are being issued in all oases where the crops are found to be true to type and reasonably free from rogues.fruit and Vegetable Societies.     Under a Scheme initiated dur ing &quot;the&apos;war some^O^^it and Vegetable Societies were establish-ed with a guarantee that in the event of their incurring a loss on the first year&apos;s trading, the Board would defray the amount of the loss up to  250.

Complaints were made early in tho oeason as to the delays in returning empty fruit baskets from distant markets by rail.    Representations were made to the Railway Exeoutive Committee and a Ciroular was Issued drawing the attention of the Railways to the inportance of this trade, pointing out that the fruit trade was to a large extent dependent en the prompt return of empties in order to forward fresh consignments.    This Circular, combined with representations in individual oases, appears to have secured a considerable improvement, but during the past fortnight the congestion again became acute on the Great Northern, the North Eastern and the Great Western Railways,    Preen representations have been made in the matter and it is believed that the immediate trouble is being remedied.    The traffic in empties is, however, from a railway point of view, an unrcmunerative trade and the local railway officials are not unnaturally inclined to give preference to consignments of food and other important materials and to defer the despatch of empties, which they regard as relatively unimportant,    One cause of the congestion is the custom of sending the main bulk of the empties through London in order that they may be re-distributed.    Some of the London merchants are endeavouring, in accordance with &amp; recommendation in the Board&apos;a leaflet, to have the empties returned direct to growers instead of via London, while two other large flrmB have established depots for sorting and re-distributing empties at Waltham Cross,yeohnical and Cultivation Division.Requirements and DiBoosal Section.

In relation to expenditure whioh falls to bo charged ultimately to the Development Pund, the question of future economy is not so acute and the programme of reconstruction which has recently been submitted for consideration does not appear to be in jeopardy, A conference has been held with the Governors of the Harper Adams College to co raider proposals for capital expenditure rendered necessary by the expansion of the College,    It was decided that an expenditure of  18,000 must be incurred forthwith, a moiety of which might be found by the Treasury.
Further discussions on the future of the Seale Hayne College, haw taken plaoe with the new Principal.   Here also immediate capital expenditure - especially on farm buildings - is required.County Education.   The work in oonneotion with County Education continues to be mainly conceded with the Estimates of expenditure and the calculation of the grants likely to be payable.    Schemes for the expansion of educational programmes are also under examination.

Speaking generally the instruction in- Dairying is found to be much appreciated and the work of organising the class centres is much less difficult than formerly owing to the;: greater readiness with which.the producer comes forward to be instructed. In the case of several Counties, however, there are indications that the milk is falling off in quantity more rapidly than last year .Co-operative Cheese Factories have also been visited at Trelbech, Bargoed, Carmarthen, i Caersws, Abermule and Berriew.Much evidence is forthcoming that the establishment of co-operative dairies has resulted itt-a considerable increase in the number of cows kept in the dietriots where tfrey are situated. .

Many of these pjplls are training on isolated farms at some distance from railway stations, and it is felt that special courses of instruction in. agricultural subjects at centres will not be possible, but it has been decided to ask pupils to take up a definite course Of home study and such a course has been planned. Study during the first six months will be chiefly confined to soils and manures, and books will be loaned by the Committee to pupils.     In order that students may benefit to the fulLest extent by these studies, and that they may be given expert assistance, questions dealing with
the subject matter will be set and the answers corrected and returned tc students every month.    In addition to this pupils will be informed of all classes arranged in their immediate neighbourhood in technical sub-jects which have a bearing on agriculture.2.   Training of Lien.&quot;Disabled i,ien.    Instructions have been issued to Agricultural Executive Committees to bring into force the payment of the new scale of training allowances on the first pay day after September 6th.It has been ascertained that the new scale of allowance will not apply to men in receipt of &quot;alternative pensions&quot; as distinct from the ordinary disability pension under the Koyal Pensions Warrant, such men being entitled to a special rate of training allowance based on the alternative pension.    Agricultural Katecutive Committees are being in-structed as to the manner in which cases of this hind are to be dealt with.    It is probable that they will not welcome the more complicated procedure necessary in these cases, but it is not expected that more than a relatively small proportion of trainees will come under this category.dumber of Men in Training. &quot;Disabled Ivten&quot; On 1st    Joined sinoe Completed Left for Still i?at Centres.

How that the potatoes in the Demonstration Plot have been dug, a commencement will be made with intensive market gardening.   This plot is 5 acres in extent, 2 *acres of which have been planted with Apples and Plums.

The soil hers is reported as not very suitable for market gardening or fruit $rowing.   Three larfje growers in the County have been visited with a view to obtaining their opinions on horticultural development, from which it appears that the present Committee is not con-sidered to be sufficiently practical.   Two of these growers would no doubt oonsent to serve on the Committee if a3ked to do so.Carnarvonshire,   Two market gardens have been visited with a view to ascertaining their suitability for the training of ex-Service men,Worcestershire.

The notice created great interest.Six weekly courses have been arranged and applications are being steadily received, though naturally in smaller numbers than at the beginning of the Week.   The majority of the applicants are allotment holders and persons with large gardens, who grow their own fruit and vegetables, but there is also a fair number of fruit-growers and two of the applicants were members of the trade,keeping.,   ,        A considerable demand is-being made for Registration Forms in connection with the arrangements for the supply of sugar for the autumn feeding of Bees.   Up to the present time the number of Registration Forms applied for exceeds the number received for spring feeding by over three thousand..

These will help the Board in considering what price to recommend the Ministry of Pood to allow,lant Disease.The Potato Prop.   In 1918 a very lar^e acreage of potatoes was grown, the crops were excellent and well above the average, with a result that we were able to export very large quantities and to turn a proportion into potato flour.   This year the acreage of potatoes has decreased somewhat, but is even now well above that of pre-war years;   the crop too will not be heavy and may in fact be 10$ below the average, though much depends on the weather conditions which will prevail throughout the month of September.   At present there is only quite a small amount of &quot;late blight&quot; showing in the potatoes, and if the weather conditions remain favourable sound crops will be lifted.   As a result of the hot dry weather the potato plants have grown but slowly, and the plants have in most cases been attacked with Green Ply (Aphides) which has caused more damage on potatoes in England this year than hitherto.   The Aphides appear in large numbers on the green plants, punctare the soft tissues of the leaves and suck the sap out.   In America the pest has been known to cause a complete collapse of the potato plants;   here the attacks are less serious, but it &quot;is important to remember that Burgundy mixture causes much damage when sprayed on to potato leaves previously injured and weakens by Aphis attack.   A large number of growers have reported this season that spraying has damaged their crops of potatoes, and much correspondence concerning this ha3 been received.Wart Disease of Potatoes.   The disease has made its appearance in comparatively few cases, in the very large areas known to be badly infected with the fungus.   It has been noted in &quot;rogues&quot; growing in crops of Immune Varieties and in susceptible varieties planted contrary to the Board&apos;s Orders.   These contraventions are fewer than anticipated and are receiving proper attention.   Farmers in infected areas are dissatisfied with the Immune Varieties for market purposes, the complaint being that King Edward - a susceptible variety - sells more readily, even at  3 per ton higher, than the Immune Varieties.   Enquiries have shown that the complaints are true, so that the Board1s -policy of allowing sales of susceptible varieties in infected areas must be     reviewed.   All Inspectors are busy on the inspection of Potato Crops throughout the country.Diseases of Fruit Trees.   During this week very few inquiries have reached the Board as to these diseases.   Inspectors report that Brown Rot is causing los3 of the Apple and Plum Crops in some districts.   Silver Leaf too is appearing on an extensive scale and the growers generally are relieved to find that the Board are considering; the situation.Labour Division.Demobilis at ion.   The number of men described as agriculturists demobilised &quot;during the seven days ended 27th August --was 1,214, making the total demobilised to that date 245,422.An Army Order (Ho. 296, dated 22nd August, 1919) has been issued, the effect of which is to render eligible for demobilisation all Warrant Officers, i;;on-Commissioned Officers and men who enlisted voluntarily and joined for continuous service with the Colours prior to 1st July, 1916*   This includes all soldiers serving on an attestation form, but men who were called up under the Military Service Acts are excluded,
vfomen1 a Dran ch.The present position with regard to the demand and supply is as follows:-   243 women are or will he out of employment this coming week;   of these 100 are milkers and dairywomen and 21 other skilled women, while 115 are general workers who have &quot;been through the ordinary course of training.   It is regrettable that even this small number of women, some of whom have had from 18 months to two years&apos; experience as farm workers, should be out of employment. In V7est Sussex the Organising Secretary reports that the increased wages affect the employment of women, while in Buckinghamshire the reason given is the difficulty in obtaining billets now that more casual male labour is available.. In the first week of September, 1918, the total number waiting employment was 728;   therefore., although the total number now working in the Land Army has been reduced by half it will be seen that the present unemployment is relatively less than at a similar time la3t year.   Of the 8,050 members of the Land Array in employment to-day excellent reports continue to be received.Pending any decision as to the date for demobilising the Land Army, and in view of the fact that the supply is at the present time ahead of the demand, the County Selection Committees, to whom the Ministry of Labour are now sending a certain number of applicants for farm work, are being informed that none except those with exceptional agricultural experience are to be enrolled until further notice.   For the present also no further training centres are being opened.Some of the women who signed on for 12 months and have been working for the flax harvest are to be trained at the Haningstone Centre in Leicester for 6 weeks.   At the centre an excellent course is given in all kinds of general farm work and horse work under a very competent instructress.   The training is given on 3 farms where large herds are kept.The East Suffolk Education Committee has offered  40 for four scholarships to Land Army girls.   Generally these scholar-ships are only available at the Kidland Agricultural College or the Chelmsford Dairy Institute.   Great difficulty is being experienced in making arrangements for particular candidates at the dates of the courses offered.   It has therefore been proposed that the Education Committee shall hold a dairy class for butter and cheese making on some approved farm, and six  land Army girls have been chosen for the class which will also be opened to other farm workers.It is interesting to notice that at the women1s managed farm at Great Bidlake, in Devonshire, the price offered per aore recently for corn in the ground was the highest for any Food Production Department farm in Devon.   The figure realised for oats was  13. 10. per acre.yeomen1 s Institutes.   Three new Y*omen&apos;s Institutes have been started during the,week.; making a,total of 1,193.

The machines await shipment at New York, but tonnage cannot be obtained.    The Board have explained the urgency of the position to the Ministry of Shipping, and have moved that Department to arrange for the shipment at New  York,Expert of Fresh Herrings,    There has been a good deal of misapprehension during the we*ek as to the actual position with regard to the export of fresh herrings.    The export of fresh herrings was agreed to by the Ministry of Pood in May, and thiB was announced by the Board in a circular dated 17th May,1919.   A further circular has now been issued to clear up the situation, indicating that the export of fresh herrings is now permissible without licence to all destinations, except certain ports of European Russia,Owing to glut landings and difficulties of distribution resulting in waste of fish, boat owners are proposing to land their catches direct at a foreign port without first touching a British port.    There is at present no legal obstacle to this action, but after consulting the Ministry of Pood it has been agreed, pending a conference to be held shortly, not to notify the Trade to that effect aa tho Ministry of Pood fear that such a course might lead to a serious diversion of food supplies.     A conference is being arranged between representatives of the Ministry of Pood and the Export Licence Department to consider a scheme whereby fish of all kinds might be allowed to be exported in time of glut on the authority of local offioers of the Ministry of Pood or the Pishery Boards.ffiiale Pishing, off the Falkland Islands.   The Board - in compliance with a requos&quot;b^rom&quot;tlTe^C&apos;oioiifaT Office - have further advised that Department as to the amendments to be made in an Ordinance to regulate the sea fisheries off the Falkland Islands. The Ordinance was designed for the protection of the Whale fisheries as well as sea fisheries, and it was desired to ensure that Whales in extra-territorial waters should only be taken in accordance with approved methods.    Modifications with this object have been suggested for the consideration of the Colonial Office.Bait for Sea Angling.   The British Sea Anglers Society have represeuted tcTThTOoard that mussels for bolt were wanted in AugUBt, which is a closed mo rth for mussels son several parts of the ooast.    The Board have been able to put them in touoh with fish merchants at Morecambo Bay who are able to send supplies.Looe Harbour.   The question of Looe Harbour improvement has again arisen&quot;during the week.    The Board decided that the best course would be to transfer the control of the harbour undertaking from the Harbour Commissioners to the Urban District Council.     The Council and the fishermen concurred, but the consent of the Harbour Commissioners was necessary before such a transfer could be effected, and this the Commissioners have now refused to give.     They are, however, arranging to repair the harbour on their own responsibility, without proceeding further with their application for an advanoe from the Development Fund,In the- lircumstanoes, the Board, on their part, do not propose to proceed further with the Draft Provisional Order under the Pishery Harbours Act, and they have accordingly acquainted the Development Commissioners of the position.Obstructions in Tor and Start Bays,     Complaints having been received of the obstructions to fishing operations caused by the remains of Naval booms left on the sea bed, the Board1 a District Inspector has arranged with the Local Naval Authorities for the removal of the d*bris.
