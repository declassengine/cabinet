(This DocHnsent j^jhe,Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government(P 5321)From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department 8th September 1919./Your telegram of 1st September, 1.278. Afghanistan. Again the Secretary of State finds himself asked to approve a fait accompli. But whatever language may have been used in conversation I regret that cannot sanction official use of title Majesty until Amir has given evidence of goodwill, of which there is at present&apos;no indication. Very fact that Afghans appear anxious to secure title is reason for reserving it. Meanwhile, we should surely treat them as was suggested by you and agreed by me without friendship until they show by acts that they realise that our favour is worth having. This is line on which I must defend tactics which are widely thought - here to have involved us in the surrender of prestige.
