J    Paraphrase of a Telegram from the Governor-General of the v ^Un^bn of South Africa to the Secretary of State for the^t%feved Colonial Office 12.23 p,m,, 11th September, 1919).Urgent.   Clear the Line.September 11th,   Secret.   Very urgent.referring to my telegram 6th September as to garrison, following is substance of Ministers minute ccmment-ing on telegram from War Office to General Officer Commanding South African Military Command of 27th August begins:-This is first notification received by Ministers of the proposal to send Imperial Troops to tho Cape Peninsula immediately to take over garrison duties there.Ministers intimated in their secret minute March loth (see my telegram 14th March) that they were anxious that His Majesty1s Government should discuss with the Union Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence who were at that time in Europe the future arrangements for naval and military defence of South African coasts and harbours.   No opportunity apparently presented itself for any discussion which led to Conclusions on any points including the important one of the defence of the Cape Peninsula,Ministers feel that it would in any case be inopportune under present circumstances to prejudge the issues involved by re-establishing the pre-war position of the Cape Peninsula Garrison Regular Imperial Troops until the Union &apos; Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government have exchanged views, and have arrived at definite conclusions on problem as a whole.The early return of even a portion of the Imperial Garrison would moreover present certain practical difficulties and create considerable embarrassment locally.    The problem ofthe
the employment 6? returned soldiers Bpeetally enlisted for garrison duty in Union Defence Foress would he rendered more acute and the very grave shortage cf housing accommodation which&apos;ozists would be most materially accentuated while the pressure on the available shipping for returning soldiers and  . other South Africans would be materially increased.There are also highly important constitutional political aspects involved upon which Ministers at this, juncture during special session cf the Union Parliament do not feel that they are in a position to stats attitude of Union Government and they would not moreover be able to do so until after full consultation with His Majesty1s Government.Ministers in those circumstances earnestly request that any proposals to send Imperial Troopa to the Cape Peninsula may be fo0.d in abeyance until such consultation has taken place rn.d a course of action has been agreed upon covering the general scheme.   Binds.BUITCN.
