(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERIW.SNT).SECRET. 1&apos;^ ^AR CABINET*O.T. 8119.FUTURE EMPLOYMENT IK &apos;7ARFilR5 OF ASPHYXIATING GASSS.The following Memorandum by Mr. C.J.B, Hurst, O.B., K.C., Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, is circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in reply to War Office letters of July 26th and August 1st. 1919,(G.T. 7976).(Sd.)   Thomas Jones.Actinr. Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, SAL &quot;     5th September, . 19l$.MEMORAKDU M.i &quot;iTiriri. . n/numrr ir i ii - i m , .1.1ii .v n  *m.   irijj.il -i m a iij.nj Great Britain is at present bound by Article 23 (a) of the/    Land War Regulations of 19.17, which prohibits the use of poison for the purpose of injuring an enemy.   She is also bound by paragraph (e) of the same Article, which prohibits the use of arms, projectiles or other materials likely to oause unnecessary injury.   In addition, she is bound by the Declaration of 1907 prohibiting the use of projectiles whose sole object is the diffusion of asphyxiating and deleterious gases.   It was in view of these prohibitions that Article 171 of the Peace Treaty with Germany was worded, as these prohibitions were binding upon Germany during the late war to the same extent that they were binding upon Great Britain.The use of asphyxiating and poisonous gases during the war was begun by the Germans in their notorious attack upon the Canadians In April 1915. and the use of poison gas by the Allies has hitherto been justified as an act of retaliation against the enemy.A Conference took place at Versailles In ^arch 1918 for the purpose of determining the line which should be taken by the Allied Powers in answering an appeal which had been addressed to all the belligerents by the International Red Cross to agree mutually to abandon the use of poison gas.   The answer which was then drawn up justified the continued use of this mode of fighting as a measure of retaliation against the enemy, and as a means of fighting which it was useless to abandon so long as there could be no sure guarantee that the enemy would not again resort to it when it suited his purposes.   Article 171 was in-tended to ensure that Germany should not resort to it in future.*k If it Is considered that from the military point of viewP   Great Britain stands to gain by adopting the use of poison gas,steps should be taken to renounce the Land &quot;ar Convention andthe Declaration of 1907 referred to above*(Sd.) C.J.B. Hursts4th September, 1919.
