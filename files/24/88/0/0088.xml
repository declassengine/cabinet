302/ 2-SECRET.K*s BrliMINISTRY  OF   FOOD.Report for Month ending 15th September 1919.n t sina     V&quot; mPART I-ACTION TAKEN. Staff of the Ministry.In view of the impending retirement of Sir William Beveridge, K.C.B., the Food Controller has appointed Mr. F. Ii. Coller, C.B., to be Secretary, and Mr. E. F. Wise, C.B., to be Second Secretary to the Ministry. At Mr. Roberts&apos; request, Sir William Beveridge will continue to assist the Ministry in an advisory capacity, and will remain a member of the Food Council.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade, with the concurrence of the Food Controller, have appointed Mr. Wise to be British Member of the Permanent Committee of the Inter-Allied Supreme Economic Council.An Advisory Committee has been formed consisting of representatives of ELM. Treasury, the Ministry of Food and the Board of Trade to consider and give advice on the purchase of food abroad. Mr. 0. A. McCurdy, M.P., will act as&apos; Chairman.On August 29th Mr. Roberts replied to the Prime Ministers letter of August 20th, in which was urged the importance of reductions and economy in the staff of the . department wherever possible. Mr. Roberts referred to the reduction of the number of the staff by approximately 50 per cent, between the date of the Armistice and July 1st, a programme for complete demobilisation by September 30th having been, -arranged in accordance with the Government decision to bring the Ministry to an end on that date. In view of the political necessity for the continued existence of the -Ministry during the coming winter, the retention of every possible officer whose services were still available had become a matter of urgency, and Mr. Roberts drew attention to the difficulty of keeping capable Civil Servants or experienced business men in a temporary department under peace conditions. He hoped, however, that it would be possible to carry on the whole, or practically the whole, of the work of the Ministry during 1918 with a stall of about two-thirds of the number employed in that year.A scheme on this basis is being prepared for submission to the Chancellor of the Exchequer ; but the difficulty caused by the offer to Civil Servants of permanent posts in their own or in new departments, of equal value to, and with better prospects than the conditions of their employment in the Ministry of Food, has been urged upon the Treasury for their immediate help. There are 23 Civil Servants, either holding responsible posts or doing valuable work in the department, and of these, 15 may fairly be claimed to be indispensable. What precise method may be adopted for enabling the Ministry of Food to retain the services of these officers does not concern the Ministry, but for purposes of official working it is imperative that a solution of the problem be found at once.At the date of the Armistice the number of staff employed centrally was 4,738, and the number employed locally 3,954. On September 1st the central staff had been reduced to 2,657, and the local staff to 1,820, the reduction on the entire staff being 48&quot; ti per cent. A table showing details of the reductions made is given on page 16 of this Report.Action against Profiteering in Foodstuffs.Arrangements for the representation of Food Control Committees on Local Profiteering Committees have been made with the Board of Trade. Each Local : Committee will contain at least three representatives of the Food Committee. On the special Sub-Committees which are to deal with profiteering in foodstuffs, the Food Control Committees are to have a majority representation.Prior to the introduction of the Profiteering Act proposals for checking profiteering in uncontrolled, or partly controlled, foodstuffs, such as fish, fruit, and vegetables, were under consideration by the Ministry.   One of these proposals,a  (33)8942  Pk 16  150  9/19   Ei&amp; S . - 4
24providing for a maximum margin of profit for retailers, has been taken as the basis of a scheme put forward by the retailers in the Birmingham area for a limitation of profits. This scheme is at present being considered and should form an interesting local experiment.The setting up of open-air markets for local produce has further had a good effect in reducing the prices of foodstuffs such as fish, fruit, and vegetables. In many parts of the country Food Control Committees have taken the initiative in the establishment of these markets. The reports received show that up to the present time the lower prices due to this method of sale have been maintained, but in some of the Divisional Areas the opening of such markets is opposed, partly on account of the immunity of the stall-holders from payment of rates and taxes, and partly because it is contended that the prices in open-air markets show a tendency to rise as time goes on and approximate more closely to shop prices. The executive officers of the London Food Committees consider that the disproportion between wholesale and retail prices in the London street markets is quite as great as in the shops. It is possible that the maintenance of lower prices depends on the markets being within easy reach of direct supplies.Price of Foodstuffs.It is difficult at present to make any exact comparison between the prices ruling last winter and those which may be expected in the coming winter. An attempt may be made, however, by taking the prices of the main foods in November 1918 and those anticipated in November 1919. With these as a basis the Budget consumption as estimated by the Sumner Committee (June 1918) may be fixed according to the prices ruling or expected to rule at the respective dates. Comparison may also be made with the pre-war Budget used by the Labour Statistics Department of the Ministry of Labour. It must, however, be remembered that it is necessary to assume in a comparison of this nature that the articles consumed and the quantities in which they are consumed remain unchanged. As a matter of fact there has been a con-siderable increase in consumption since last November.On the basis of prices thus obtained and applied to the consumption of the average working-class family as shown in the Sumner Budget, the expenditure in November 1918, and November 1919, may be set out as follows :-November 1918.     November .1919. Sumner Budget      -     -     -       50s. $\d. 49s. lid.If the percentage increase, given monthly in the &quot; Labour Gazette,&quot; be computed for November next on the same basis, the result is as follows : Percentage Increase since July 1914,November 1918. August 1919. November 1919.133 117 130In these estimates there are certain things which must be borne in mind. No attempt has been made to carry the forecast into next year. Last winter, taking prices as a whole, the highest point was reached in November, after which a fall was experienced ; the same cannot be predicted as to next winter. On the contrary, if general past experience be taken as a guide, the new year may witness some rise, at any rate in certain prices. Secondly, in the case of certain articles there is considerable obscurity. A great deal depends on the potato crop, since potatoes enter largely into the consumption of the average family. Again, the price of future purchases of bacon may affect the retail price, and in this instance the rate of exchange with America plays a prominent part.Speaking at Leeds on September 11th, the Food Controller dealt with the prevailing high prices for foodstuffs, drawing attention to the factors beyond the control of the Government which tended to raise prices. He pointed out that the higher wages and better conditions needed for agricultural labourers must be reflected in the price of the food produced by their labour. The scarcity of shipping for lifting supplies from Australia and New Zealand was another serious factor in the situation. Speaking of the depreciation of the currency, Mr. Roberts made it clear that the British Food Controller was bound at present to pay the prices ruling in the one country which possessed an exportable surplus of foodstuffs, and emphasized the bad effect on the national credit of continued buying from Amercia without an equivalent export to other countries of coal and manufactured goods.
Arrangements for Rationing during the Winter.&apos; The new Ration Cards, the form and purpose of which was described in the last Report, have been printed and distributed to Committees and are by this time in the hands of the public. The printing of the 45,000,000 ration cards and of the 18,000,000 accompanying leaflets of instructions was carried through ten days in advance of the scheduled time.After consultation with the Divisional Commissioners, the Consumers&apos; Council, the Retail Grocers&apos; Advisory Board and the Butchers&apos; Advisory Committee, it has been decided to issue to the public, through their retailers, Purchasers&apos; Shopping Cards for butter, sugar and meat. These cards are to be allotted to each household and contain spaces for the marking off of the households weekly ration by the retailer on the occasion of each purchase.The preparation and revision of the new ration documents has been performed at high pressure, but so far there has been no serious delay and so far as can be foreseen the shopping cards will be issued to the public at the beginning of October and the new registration will become effective by October 13th. By this date the Committees will have had time to sort and file the counterfoils sent in by retailers and will be able to assess the requirements of each retailer in respect of his newly registered customers.The re-assessment of the requirements of establishments will proceed simultaneously with the issue of ration documents to the general public.Transport and Storage.The position of transport as affecting foodstuffs is still very serious, particularly in relation to. the congestion at the ports. There is generally speaking little congestion on the railways, but the handling of foodstuffs from the ports is still far from satisfactory. The principal cause of the difficulty on the railways is that the companies are called upon to carry more passengers and goods than they did before the war, with men working less hours. This requires an increase in the operating staff which cannot be immediately effected, as large numbers of experienced railwaymen are still&quot; with the colours. Further, railway goods rates have not been raised during the war, and this has resulted in coastal shipping being neglected. The recent arrangements for subsidising the coastwise service should, however, result in a considerable tonnage of traffic being diverted from the railways to coasting steamers. The shortening of dockers&apos; hours has also resulted in much slower working in the discharging of ships and the handling of goods generally. Liverpool dockers began overtime work on September 1st, and from observations made the men appear to be working better.The position as regards storage has become more serious owing to the recent extraordinary arrivals of wool, nearly a million bags, and in consequence London, Liverpool, Hull and Immingham are all congested. Much of this wTool has been warehoused in space which otherwise would have accommodated perishable provisions, with the result that the quays at Liverpool and London are also congested with foodstuffs. In order to relieve the situation several Government Departments have agreed to relinquish certain premises inland in order that the wool may be moved away from the ports. All possible steps are being taken to obtain proper acbom-, modation for foodstuffs.Supplies and Distribution.Milk. The Food Controller, after detailed examination of all aspects of the problem and consultation with the Boards of Agriculture, the Central Agricultural Advisory Council, and the Consumers&apos; Council, has decided on the milk prices to be fixed for the ensuing winter period. The maximum prices per gallon on wholesale sales by the producer will be throughout Great Britain for the months October, 1919, till April, 1920, as follows :-Oct.     Nov.     Dec.     Jan.     Feb.     March.     April. 2s. 21   2s. Sd.   3s. 3d.   3s. 3d.   3s. 3d.    3s. Od.     2s. 2d.These figures give an average of 2s. 9fd. per gallon as against the maximum prices of 2s. 2d. for last winter. The Ministry are satisfied that having regard to the costs of production during the ensuing winter, and especially to the rise in price of concentrated feeding stuffs, hay and roots, and the increase in agricultural wages,&apos; a 2
these prices are justified, and that any lowfer scale would result in a serious diminution of supplies.   On the other hand, the Ministry are confident that they give only a reasonable and fair margin of profit to producers.   These prices have been agreed to by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. The maximum retail prices per quart will be : Oct.     Nov.     Dec,     Jan.      Keb.     March.     April. lid.      Is.       Is.       Is.       Is. Is.        lid.These prices, however, will only apply in about 8 per cent, of the 1,831 Food Control Committee districts. Lower maxima corresponding to the lesser costs of distribution will, as in the past, be fixed in the other districts throughout the country.As it is most desirable that consumption of milk, especially by young children, should not be reduced below the present level, which is considered by medical experts to be already too low, the Food Controller, with the concurrence of tho Ministry of Health, has drawn attention in the Press to the power vested in local authorities to provide milk for expectant and nursing mothers and for children under five years of age through Maternity and Child Welfare Centres at a reduced price or free of cost in cases in which the local authorities are satisfied that circumstances justify the pro-vision. The Ministry of Health make a grant of half the expenditure incurred by the local authorities and by voluntary societies in supplying milk at less than cost in cases, where the arrangements are approved by them.Meat.-The Meat Branch has now in hand the new arrangements necessitated by the decision of the Cabinet to continue control. As regard price, it has already been announced that an advance in the retail price of home-grown meat during the winter is inevitable, this being entirely due to the increase in the guarantee required by the British farmer for production during the next nine months. It is not yet possible to state definitely the price at which imported meat can be sold, as negotiations for a renewal of the contracts with the South American importers have not yet been com-pleted. These negotiations are being conducted jointly by representatives of the Ministry of Food and the Board of Trade in order that the purchase shall cover the requirements of the War Office and the French and Italian and Belgian Governments in addition to those of the Ministry of Food. The Consumers&apos; Council has expressed a desire that the difference between the selling prices of home-grown and imported meat shall be as wide as possible. On the advice, however, of the technical experts of the Ministry, it is probable that the difference in price will not exceed the present difference of 3d. per lb.From estimates which have been prepared by the Board of Trade, there appears to be every reason to anticipate that the supplies of imported meat will be fully adequate to meet all requirements in this country during the coming winter. It is likely that apart from any demands which may be made for storage of bacon, the storage capacity of the country will be taxed to the utmost.Bacon. Some agitation was shown in certain sections of the Press during the week ending September 13th on the bacon position. It was alleged in particular in a letter to &quot; The Times &quot; that the present situation was due to the lack of business experience in the Ministry. It may be useful to give here a brief summary of the considerations for which control was removed last March and reimposed in August.&quot;Control was removed on March 29th, in accordance with the general policy then pursued by the Government of restoring trade to its normal conditions as quickly as possible, and upon the assurance of experts in the bacon trade that prices would fall considerably upon the removal of control. Decontrol, however, resulted in a steady and persistent rise in prices, which was helped to a considerable extent by speculative purchases in anticipation of continental demands. The Food Controller had then to choose between (a) removing the maximum retail price altogether, (b) raising it considerably, and (c) resuming complete control in order to regulate wholesale prices effectively. The third was the only possible course; control was therefore re-estab-lished, and prices were stabilised forthwith.The Ministry were fully aware both of the congestion of bacon supplies and of the condition of the bacon when they took control. All purchases were stopped on August 9th ; cold stores were cleared so far as possible of non-perishable goods ; and the goods were graded at the ports, so that bacon unfit for food should not be shipped free into the country.The following prices show the results of the Ministry&apos;s action. On March 29th when control was removed, the price of hogs was $19.90 ; on May 15th it was $21,20 ;
on June 15th, $21.50 ; on July 15th, $22.80.   Control was reimposed on August 9th ; on August 14th the price was $23.40 ; on August .18th, $20.75; on August 20th, $18.50.   The price is now (September 15th) $17.50, the lowest point which has been, reached,this year.Tea. --Difficulties are being experienced in obtaining sufficient tonnage to bring the necessary supplies of tea into this country. On representations made by the Ministry of Food last June, the Ministry of Shipping agreed that average monthly shipments of tea, aggregating 18,000 tons (13,000 tons from India and 5,000 from Ceylon), should be made from June to December, and that a deficit in any month should be made up by increased shipments in succeeding months. The June shipments amounted only to 6,100 tons, the July shipments to 17,264 tons and those during the first half of August to 8,199 tons, i.e., a deficit of 13,000 tons up to August ,15th. It is doubtful whether there will be any improvement on. this average during the present month, and the continued small shipments are causing the gravest anxiety on the tea market and are resulting in serious rises in the wholesale. price, which will reflect itself in the retail price.At present the retail prices still remain at from 2s. per lb. upwards, and the 2s. 4d, to 2s. Qd. tea is of very good average quality.Dried Fruits. The reports respecting the crops of dried fruits in the countries of production are unfavourable. The latest telegraphic advice concerning the currant crop is to the effect that heavy rains have damaged vast quantities of the fruits and it is likely that there will be a shortage of figs and sultanas. It appears that the advance of the Greek forces into the country in the Smyrna region has been resisted by the natives, and it is reported that in the valley of the Hermus the farmers are -abandoning their vineyards.Despite these reports, purchases have already been made by the Ministry of Food .at prices considerably below those secured by private importers just before control was re-imposed, and it is anticipated that the stocks which will be available for Christmas distribution will not fall very much below the normal demand.   They will in any case exceed the amounts available last Christmas.       -   - ,.        ,   *- ; A temporary distribution scheme for dried fruit daring the Christmas period will be brought into force in order to ensure an adequate minimum supply to the consumer.        &quot; &apos;,-Butter and Sugar Distribution. A new system of butter distribution will shortly come into operation. Under the present system the monthly out-goings of butter are nearly 400 tons in excess of the amount needed to supply the 1^- oz. ration. This is partly due to the present out-of-date registration and partly to the lack of a sufficient-check on the retailers&apos; permits. Under the new system the retailer will have a single permit based on the requirements of his newly registered customers, with an additional&quot;margin of supplies for which he must account. The permit will be checked at intervals and the margin adjusted in accordance with the result of the check.A revision of the existing Sugar Distribution Scheme on similar&apos;lines is also being undertaken.Oils and Fats. The system of supervision of the oils and fats trades which was , brought into being by the Seeds, Oils and Fats Order, 1919, as a substitute for the ,&apos;former comprehensive control, is now satisfactorily established, and-the &quot;operation of , the licences has had the effect of preventing any further rise in the price of these &quot;products. Certain important oils have, on the contrary,, fallen considerably in price, For instance, palm kernel crude oil has dropped from 9SI. to 95L, and linseed oil, which stood at 1174. at: the beginning of the month, is now at %l.  &apos;The policy adopted has been to fix maximum prices by agreement with the trade for the deodorised refined oils used for edible purposes and to restrict the use of these oils to edible purposes entirely, leaving free the prices of the raw maerials and,- the crude oil.,&apos; This policy assures a Certain margin to crushers in their purchases of seeds but avoids the evils of a maximum price for imports, which might result in thei diversion of raw materials to other destinations. As there are large stocks in the hands of the crushers it has been possible for British buyers during the past month to pursue a cautious policy with regard to prices. paid abroad. As a result the continental market has followed the lead of London to a considerable extent and there is evidence that the prices of imported materials are on. the downward grade, e.g.yA  8912 &apos;.,/&apos; A3
Indian linseed has fallen from 54Z. to 4&amp;L, Argentine linseed from 521. to 421. and copra from the Straits from 591. 10s. to 56L 10s.Feeding Stuffs. -The Cattle Cakes and Meals (Licensing) Order, issued to eliminate speculation in the feeding-stuffs trade, came into force on September 15th.It has been decided to release to the trade for distribution through ordinary trade channels the stocks at present held by the Ministry of Food. These stocks, which are approximately 30,000 tons of straight feeding stuffs and 45,000 tons of materials suitable for use in compound cake manufacture, are partly in this country, partly on passage, and partly in the country of origin. They will be released at prices agreed between representatives of the trade and of the Department.Jam. The new Jam Prices Order came into operation on September 15th. The effect of this Order is that maximum, prices remain at the same figure as List year and that mixtures of either marrow, melon or rhubarb with other fruit are removed from the schedule.Potatoes. Estimates for the 1919 crop are coming to hand. In England and Scotland the crop is below the average. Ireland reports a very good crop, and expects to have 300,000 tons available for export. There should be sufficient supplies to last through the season at a reasonable price both to the producer and consumer.The growers are at present considerably handicapped in sending their produce to&apos; the markets through lack of transport, and large quantities of vegetables are being wasted owing to this cause.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.Since August l-5th the following new Orders have been signed-The Registration of Dealers (New Certificates) Order, 1919. By this Order certain Orders dealing with the registration of dealers in connection with margarine, meat, milk, potatoes, sugar, flour and bread, have been amended to authorise the Food Controller to grant certificates of registration to any applicant.The Misdescription of Maximum Prices Order, 1919.-This Order is directed to check the practice of treating maximum prices as fixed prices and prohibits the use of any notice containing &quot; Government Price, &quot; &quot; Controlled Price,&quot; &amp;c, unless the notice clearly shows that the price in question is the highest price that may be charged.The Cattle Cakes and Meals (Licensing) Order, 1919.-This Order requires all dealings made in certain scheduled seeds, nuts, and kernels after September 15th to be under licence. Certain necessary exceptions are made to meet the case of contracts entered into before the date of the Order, purchases for home use and certain small purchases. Manufacturers above a certain output are required to be licensed and provision is taken for issuing five classes of licences.Cereals. A consolidating Order. The Cereals (Restriction) Order,, 1919, incorporates, with certain amendments and additions, the provisions of three Orders, which are thereupon revoked, viz., the Wheat, Rye and Rice (Restriction) Order, 1917, the Damaged Grain, Seeds and Pulse (Prices) Order, 1917, and the Grain (Prices) Order, 1918. The maximum selling price is fixed for damaged wheat, both imported and home grown and for tailings and screenings of wheat which are unfit for use in the manufacture of flour for human food.The following changes have taken place in existing Orders :-Cream. The General Licence suspending the restrictions on the sale of cream was revoked as from September 1st. The Cream Order, 1918, therefore, became again in force as from that date. .. Dried Fruits. By a General Licence dated August 23rd, 1919, Tunis, Algerian or Egyptian dates, or plums grown in France and packed in tins and bottles, were excluded from the provisions of the Dried Fruits (Restriction) Order, 1919.Meat. By a General Licence dated August 23rd, 1919, under the Live Stock (Sales) Order, 1918, additional charges were authorised for certain classes of live and dead weight cattle for September sales.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Stocks.With a further increase in the rate of delivery of flour from mills and imported stocks, total stocks of wheat (including flour) in the United Kingdom, apart from the new home crop, fell by 152,000 tons in August. This compares with a decrease of 146,000 tons in July, and a decrease of 159,000 tons in August of last year. If the estimated new home crop be included in the stocks on September 1st, the cereal year starts with a total stock of 2,560,000 tons, or approximately 19 weeks supply on hand, as against 3,408,000 tons a year ago. The heavy arrivals of barley during August are reflected in an increase of 53,000 tons in the stocks on September 1st, exclusive of the estimated new crop, which brings the total stock on that date to 1,320,000 tons as against 1,457,000 tons a year ago. As regards oats, the stock at the end of the cereal year (140,000 tons) compares favourably with last year, but the estimate of the new crop is 800,000 tons less. No information is available yet as to the new crop of beans and peas, but as regards stock, other than farm stock, the position is pretty much the same as last year. The light imports of,other cereals are reflected in decreases in the stocks, which continue the downward movement of recent months at about the same rate.Of the stocks of meat and provisions in cold stores and importers&apos; warehouses on August 1st and September 1st, those of refrigerated meat increased from 72,600 tons to 83,300 tons, or three weeks&apos; total requirements of butcher&apos;s meat.   Quantities of. bacon and hams in cold stores and warehouses rose from 44,200 tons.to 61,600 tons, &apos; but owing to delays in transport, the&apos; increase in the total stocks in the country wasa -iBy a notice dated August 22nd, 1919, under the Meat (Maximum Prices) Order, 1917, maximum wholesale prices were fixed for special cuts of imported meat cut before shipment.Bacon. Consequent upon certain action taken by the Food Controller for the . purchase on his behalf of bacon, ham and lard in America, the Imported Bacon, Ham. and Lard (Requisition) Order, 1919, has been amended to provide that he will not requisition any bacon, ham or lard which was hot purchased before August 9th, 1919, for shipment to Great Britain and which may arrive in Great Britain before September 21st, 1919. The amending Order further permits traders in this country to negotiate shipments of bacon, ham and lard direct from one foreign country to .   another.Poultry and Game. By an amending Order to the Poultry and Game (Prices) Order, 1918, grouse, black game, and partridges hatched in the year 1919 are brought into the Order.Cheese. By a General Licence dated September 2nd, 1919, under the Caerphilly Cheese (Retail Prices) Order, 1919, Caerphilly cheese is freed from restriction as to retail price.Bread. By a General Licence dated September 3rd, 1919, under the Flour and Bread (Prices) Order, 1917, the price of bread has been increased one halfpenny per quartern, making the price 4fd. per 2-lb. loaf. This carries , out the decision of the Food Controller to sanction a halfpenny increase to meet the cost of production of bread after reviewing the recent award of. the Court of Arbitration affecting the wages and hours of operative bakers.The following Orders have been revoked :-The Desiccated Cocoanut (Maximum Prices) Order, 1918. The Malt (Restriction) Order, 1918. The Stone Fruit (Jam Manufacturers&apos; Prices) Order, 1919.Enforcement of Orders,During the four weeks ended 30th August there were 1,868 prosecutions, of which 1,720 were successful. Particular attention has been given to cases in which retailers have supplied meat, butter, or sugar to persons other than their registered customers.
probably even greater than this. Stocks of canned meat at 41,000 tons fully main-tained the very high level of recent months, and there was also a slight increase in the smaller group of poultry, game, and rabbits. Lard, which reached a minimum point in July, rose sharply in August by 5,900 tons to 16,700 tons, and cheese also reflected the heavier imports in an increase of 1,400 tons. On the other hand the small supplies of butter led to an actual decrease of the stock to 17,700 tons, in spite of the reduction of the ration, and the low output of margarine caused a drain on the small stock which had been accumulated in the preceding few months.Stocks of sugar showed a further drop of 41,000 tons, which is contrary to the experience of recent years at this season. Those of tea and coffee both suffered from the light imports of the month, though the quantities remaining were still very large, and the quantity of cocoa, on the balance of imports, re-exports and consumption, was maintained at its recent high level. .imports.The rate of import of the principal foods and feeding stuffs rose steadily during August from 186,900 tons in &quot;the first week to 306,400 tons in the last week. The weekly average for the month (250,800 tons) shows a considerable increase on that for July (221,900 tons), and, continuing the improvement of recent months, now puts the total arrivals for the year to date above the corresponding quantity for last year. In the case of oils, oilseeds and cake also, which are quoted separately, imports in August compare favourably with those in July for the more important items, and render still more favourable the comparison with a year ago.The increase in the total import of principal foodstuffs is accounted for by the improved rate of arrivals of cereals. The outstanding feature here again as in July is the exceptionally large quantities of barley received, the weekly rate for the month. (42,600 tons), being nearly seven times the rate for the first half of this year. Imports of wheat and flour were also large, representing 86 per cent. of.our current require-ments of flour, and another satisfactory feature, especially from the feeding stuffs point of view, was a further increase in the proportion arriving as grain. Oats, maize, and rice showed a steady improvement from the, low rates for July, and the average arrivals for August were quite up to the. level for this year.Imports of refrigerated meat (16J6O0 tons per week) remained at a high figure which/taken with the growing autumn .home supplies, leaves an increasing surplus over current requirements. Though those of bacon and hams were not just so heavy as in July, they were still considerably above current consumption, and the same&apos; applies to the weekly arrivals of lard, which reached 4,100 tons. There was a welcome increase in the imports of cheese, which at 4,200 per week was nearly three times the rate which prevailed for the first seven months of the year. Weekly arrivals of condensed milk (4,200 tons) maintained the high rate of the previous month, and those of margarine showed steady growth, with an average of 700 tons, but those of butter decreased still further, falling below 1,000 tons, or only about half the rate for earlier months.    &apos;  . t : &quot;Total net imports of sugar showed a further fall from 140,000 tons in July to 107,000 tons in August, which leaves a deficit of about one-fourth on current requirements, and the arrivals of tea at 2,540 tons per week carried further the movement of July, when for the first time, over a considerable period supplies fell below requirements. There was a remarkable slump in the arrivals of coffee during the month, and cocoa also fell sharply from the recent high rate, though the quantity of the latter received (1,600 tons per week) was still sufficient to cover requirements and allow of a weekly re-export of 700 tons.Consumption.Butchers* Meat. Supplies of home-grown meat in Great Britain were very small (12,700 tons) in the first week of August following upon the rush of stock to the markets at the end of July. The effect of the announcement that the August prices would be retained for September was to stabilise supplies, which for the remaining weeks of the month averaged about 18,500 tons. This compares with an estimated weekly average of 14,900 tons for August of last year, and what may be termed a normal seasonal supply (1916) of over 22,000 tons. Issues of refrigerated meat for August showed a weekly average of 7,000 tons, and the estimated total consumption of butchers&apos; meat bj civilians in Great Britian was 26,500 tons, as
ft . SHIPagainst a weekly rate of 21,9.00 tons, a year ago, when the weekly quantity of refrigerated meat included was also 7,000 tons. &apos; &apos;&apos;;Flour. Deliveries,of..flour.from mills and releases of flour from imported stocks rose further from a weekly rate of 99,100 tons in July to 102,000 tons in August.&apos; For the three months June to August the weekly rate was 98,200 tons, or almost exactly the same as that for the corresponding months of 1918. When allowance is made for the reduction of supplies to troops overseas on the one.hand, and for the increased civilian population on the other hand, these figures represent a reduction of 3 to 4 per cent, on the per capita consumption of flour within the United Kingdom, leaving the latter still abont 8 per cent, above the estimated pre-war level.Fish.-The following table illustrates the supplies of fish during August and their distribution : Fish Supplies in August.

If the latter be excluded, landings of other fish are 46,500 tons, 48,100 tons, and 25,800 tons for August 1919, July 1919, and August 1918 respectively. The comparison of total supplies with those of a year ago shows the remarkable. recovery of the fishing industry, but as regards the proportion reaching the large consuming centres, while August shows some improvement on July, it still compares very unfavourablv with the position in1918. ,;.-* ---------......-Other Foodstuffs. During August the weekly rate of cheese distribution, taken with the free supplies of home cheese, represented about 1,800 tons per week avail-able for consumption within the United Kingdom. This shows, a considerable reduction on July, when the corresponding weekly quantity was 2,500 tons. There was a further decrease in the weekly production of margarine, which fell from 6,000 tons in July to 4,400 tons in August. The latter is still slightly in excess of the production a year before, and in addition this year there were also available imported supplies to the extent of about 700 tons per week. On August 11th the basis of the distribution of butter was reduced from 2 ozs. to 1\ oz. per head per week, whereas last year the 2-oz. basis was maintained up to October 19th, when it was reduced to 1 oz. It is estimated that if margarine used in manufactures be excluded, the total supplies of butter and margarine available for direct consumption within the United Kingdom were slightly below the corresponding figures for August 1918.Prices.The statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour show for September 1st a slight decrease in the average retail food prices. The increase since July 1914 is now 116 per cent., as against 117 per cent, on August 1st, 1919. The decrease on the month, which occurred also a year ago and for the same reason, is due to a fall of ; 24&quot;5 per cent, in the retail price-of the new crop of potatoes. The only other appreciable decrease was a further fall of 1&apos; 4 per cent, in fish. On the other hand there was a further seasonal increase of 5*4 per cent, in eggs, bringing the price of the latter to 4s. Id. per dozen, as compared with 4s. 9d. per dozen a year ago. Owing to the short notice of the increase in the price of bread, the increase had not become operative everywhere on September 1st, and appears in the return as one of only 2&apos; 7 per cent., or \d. on the loaf. The increase of H.&apos;per quart in the maximum price of milk appears as an increase of \d. per quart, though for a somewhat different reason, viz., that in quite a number of places when the actual price is generally below the maximum, no decrease occurred in the previous month when the maximum price was reduced by Id. Other changes were individually negligible, but the general movement was upwards.As regards wholesale prices in August, with the cancellation of the Grain Prices Order, there was an upward movement in home-grown cereals.   In the case of wheat,
it was very slight, but for barley there was an increase from 62s. lOd. to 86s. Id. per quarter, and for oats from 50s 3d. to 61s. 10c?. per quarter. An apparent reduction in the price of Canadian wheat is due to a change in the stage at which the subsidy is paid by the Government. In the provisions group the only change was a further increase in Canadian bacon, which ranged about 204s. per cwt., as against 195s. 7d. in July. Indian tea rose steadily from Is. 2\d. to Is. 4cZ. per lb., while the Ceylon variety fluctuated somewhat, with a net increase of \d. per lb. on the month. There was a general downward movement in the prices of oilseeds and cake, linseed falling from 1,110s to 1,060s. per ton, cottonseed from 660s. to 618s. per ton, and palm kernels from 900s. to 889s. per ton. Cottonseed cake fell from 400s. to 395s. per ton, and other kinds remained steady.Note on the Cereal Position.With the opening of a&apos; new cereal year, it is of interest to review briefly the statistical position as regards supplies and requirements in the United Kingdom.The estimated consumption of the principal cereals for all purposes, but excluding seed and tail corn, during the cereal year 1918-19, as compared with the two previous years and the average of five years before the war, is shown in the following table:  - 	Pre-War Average.	1916-17.	1917-18.	1918-19.Wheat         ....

The available data indicate that the quantities available for consumption, after deduction of seed and tail corn, will be about 1,550,000 tons of wheat, 1,100,000 tons of barley, and 3,200,000 tons of oats. If requirements be taken at the same rates as in 1918-19, the prospective home production represents approximately 11 weeks&apos;, 34 weeks&apos;, and 38 weeks&apos; supply for wheat, barley and oats respectively.ab regards cereals entirely imported, it is impossible to state what the require-ments of maize will be, especially for feeding-stuffs purposes. It may be noted, however, that the stocks of rice on hand represent, at the recent rate of consumption, over 20 weeks&apos; supply.
