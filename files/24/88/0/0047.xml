During the week the Board have reoeived notice of an Order made by the East Suffolk County Council for the compulsory acquisition of Valley Farm, Sproughton,, comprising 250 acres.Offers of Land by Land-owners.   The offers received direct by the Board In response to the President^ appeal to landowners for land suitable for small holdings number 216 comprising approximately 46,000 acres.

4 *) Q 1 5 0continued bud weather and the high rate of wages for harvest work, the harvesting operations will prove very expensive, unless the weather improves.   &apos;6o much rain fell that harvest work and steam cultivation were brougnt to a stand-still for some days.   At Holbeach the settlers were engaged in lifting their.potatoes and harvesting their own crops. Their spare time being taken up on the Central Farm.   It is hoped to finish cutting the corn on three of the farms this week.   At Pembrey with the exception of 24 acres of unripe oats, the corn has been cut and stooked.   One hut has been practically completed and another required only a few days&apos; work to complete it. , At Amesbury mainly potato picking has been carried on.   The corn is yielding a much better crop than was at first anticipated.    Roots show an improvement as a result of the recent rain.    At Kolieston   the corn crons are poor, barley being the best.    Some of&quot; the barley is very late and v:ill not ripen without more sun.   Roots look weal and are up to the average. A^ Heath Hill rain fell every day, but It was possible to do a fair amount of&apos;Earvest work.   Thirty-eight acres of barley and 15fe acres oats were reaped, and 46 acres of wheat were carted.   A quantity of potatoes was also lifted.(11) Vfork of Agricultural Executive Committees.Land in possession of Xornmitteej   A conspicuous example of the benefit secured to the country &quot;by the Judicious exercise of the powers vested in the Board for the. purpose of increasing the nation&apos;s food supply is afforded by the work of the East Sussex A.E.C., on the Peaeehaven Estate between Brighton and Newhaven.    Before the Com committee took possession of the land in,1917 the property was retorted to have been In a deplorably jfjeglected condition; growing nothing but rubbish.   In that year, 160 acres were fallowed and sown with wheat in the autumn, and in the following spring 225 acres Were sown with oats.   The wheat received a dressing of basic slag in the autumn at the rate of 5 cwt to the acre, and the whole had a top dressing of sulphate of ammonia In the following spring at the rate of 1 cwt to the acre.The wheat yielded an average of 11 sacks an acre, a result Men the board&apos;s Sub-Commissioner regards as most gratifying, as nder normal circumstances similar land produces about 8 packs;  The leld of oats averaged about 8 sacks per acre.   A profit and loss account has been kept, and at Michaelmas 1918, when the Valuation as made, the first year&apos;s transactions showed a credit balance of bout  8,000.About that time an additional 80 acres adjoining which was a an equally bad state wnre taken over and farmed by the committee nd a larger acreage was prepared for corn.   This year nearly 500 cre^were under wheat, oats, barley and potatoes.   All the wheat has ow been cut.   the Sub - Commissioner is of opinion1 that last year&apos;s verage would be maintained, if not exceeded,    The straw 18 of good uality and above the average height for the County.   The barley and ats are good average crops, and compare very favourably with the Dops in the locality.   Potatoes look well and indicate a 10 ton ield.   These results demonstrate what poor land can be made to pro-ce in essential food crops.The Board have expressed their appreciation of the gratify-ig results which have attended the efforts of the Committee, and specially their Chief Executive Officer, in connection with the cul-vation and management of this Estate.
Improvement of Cultivation.    An i.ne-banoa of the advantages-of &apos;tha jkjvrer to &quot;picseoute foe non-cemp-:Umice with a Cultivation Order ha*r been reported V&apos; the to aid from Kesteven,     In May, 1918, the A.3.C. served notices or; ft tenant to cat a hedge and olean out a dyke on land in hie ccojpation.    As the Order was not complied with an extension   was granted on January 6th. 1919, and a further extension unoil Kay 15thft     Tho tenant did not, however, carry out the work, and the Committee were, therefore, authorised on the 28th June last to prosecute him for failure to comply with the Notice.    , The matter was placed in th-ojoands of a solicitor who has now received an undertaking from the tenant that the work will he completed by the end of the year.    Legal proceedings have therefore been stayed.Determination of Tenancies,   Tho Isle of Ely A.E*C. applied to the Board to make an Order determining tho tenancy of a farm df 191 acres situated near March.     The farm was inspected by the Executive Officer in company with the Board&apos;s Sub-Commissioner, and vra,s f6und to be in a very low condition, much of the land being very dirty and appearing to be starved,     In its present state the farm was stated to be producing hardly one-third of what it should produce.     Tho tenant holds tho farm under a lease which v/ill not expire until October 1923.     One of the clauses in the lease, however, permits of re-entry &quot;by the landlord in the event of any breach or non-perform-ance of any of the tenanfs covenants, and as one of the covenants is that the tenant shall keep all the arable land clean and free from v/eeds, and manage and cultivate it in a good hu3bandlike manner so as not to impoverish, any part of it, the Board have informed the Committee that they do not think that determination of the tenancy under Regulation 2M could be justified until the landlord has tried and failed to get possession under the re-entry clauses.An Order determining the tenancy of a non-resident occupier of 12-?: acres of land in Norfolk was made last week.     The Holding comprised two fields, one of y/hich wa3 a complete mat of foul grass covered with docks, thistles etc,     An attempt had been made ta plough up 2 or 3 aorob but the work had been abandoned. The other field was stated to be covered with a growth of every kind of weed, no attempt whatever having been made to cultivate the field since the last crop was taken.     Tho tenant made tho excuse that he had arranged with some one in the neighbourhood to cultivate the land, but it was pointed out to him that the Executive Committee^ report 7/as made more than a month after the said arrangement and consequently it appeared to bo in the interests of all conoerned that the tenancy should be determined, and tho land rolet to someone who is able to cultivate it.Neglect to Thatch Ricks.    Tho Board have been in correspondence with the Ministry of Food on the question of taking action in cases where waste occurs owing to the neglect of farmers to thatch their ricks.    The Boards powers under Regulation 2M are inadequate to enable them to deal effectively with this form of waste, and the Ministry of Food have agreed to take action in suitable cases under the Waste of Foodstuffs Order,    Any instance that may come to the knowledge of an Agricultural Executive Committee, of wilful or negligent failure on the part of a farmer to thatch his ricks, will be reported to the Divisional Food Commissioner, who will place tho matter in the hands of the Local Enforcement Officer if the degree of neglect is such as to justify tho expectation of a oonviction; and Executive Committees will afford all possible assistance to the Enforcement Officer in dealing with cases of this nature.Malt for Homo Brewing,     The Halt (Restriction) Order was revoked by the Ministry &quot;of Food on the 29th ult,    Persons desiring to purchase malt for home brew:&apos;,:^ wiir.. therefore, no longer be undor the necessity of obtaining a permit *:t or? the County A,E,0. In communicating their decision i.he Aval a try on ji&apos;oo.d expressed their thanks to the Board and the Comm:! v,t,ftos   n v-he r.-*t:.af.,j.o oory manner in \fv.oh the granting .of permits had.

This is evidenced by, among other things, the large number of inspec-tion orders issued during the week (XOc from the 1st to the 8th September) and by the receipt of 39 applications for the redemption of tithe rentcharge, involving a total of  426,    Several large tithe redemptions, the redemption monies in which amount to many thousands cf pounds, are in hand on the application of Lord Do Ramsay, and it is hoped to complete most of those during the present month.Applications were f5led a few weeks ago in the Ashby-de-la-Zouch County Court for the recovery of long-Outstanding shares Of expenses of an altered appo rtioninent in Seal (Leicester);   the last of these shares lias now been paid into Courts so that no hearing will be necessary.During the week the Board have certified the redemption Of two rentcharges (other than tithe rentcharge);   the first, an enfranchisement rentcharge of  20.. 18s. 7d. on lands formerly parcel of the iianor. of Cockfield Hall, was redeemed under the Copy-hold Acts;   the second was a quit rent amounting to 16/- charged cn land at Alton (Hants.), and was redeemed under Section 45 cf the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1361.Commercial Division.tiding. Branch.Cottage Designs.    The Horth Hiding County Council recently submitted&apos; plans &quot;for&quot;five-roomed cottages without parlours, the approval of which would involve a change in the policy indicated in the first edition of the Board-e equipment Manual.    In view of the prevailing need for economy the Board will not insist on a parlour in the holdings of 5 acres or less, but they will in tne case of larger holdings .    Type plans of cottages without parlours will be inserted in the forthcoming revised edition of the januaI.

Ministry of Health.It has been decided to approve the purchase of huts by County&apos;Councils only for email holdings coming into vacant possession on or beforo Lady Pay, 1920, on which equipment is absolutely essential in order to house prospective settlers.   Every endeavour must first be made, however, to arrange for settlers to obtain accommodation at a neighbouring vdllage, or by sharing existing accommodation with a tenant on a holding in the vicinity, pending the ereotion of a permanent cottage.   If, however, it is impossible to obtain such accommodation, a County Council may purchase huts for one of the following purposes(a)   for adaptation and equipment as a cottage built to lastfov &quot;!&apos;03F&amp;e r, on 5&apos;^cd permanent foundations of concrete or*T)&quot;HoI&quot;iii/h all the necessary offices, water supply, etc,    For such buildings the Ministry of Health will sanction 15 year loan periods, and consequently this procedure can be adopted without incurring an undue charge on the finance of the Land Settlement Scheme. This go]-icy is recommended for the equipment of outlying and J&amp;olsted holdings, where transport and labour difficulties will militate against completion of permanent cottages before Michaelmas,    1920.M   For adaptation and equipment as purely temporary dwellings., lor 2&quot;r,0i ?&quot; years, pending &quot;the erection Of &quot;tne permanent cottages.

At that date abo^t El estates had been purchased, for possession it Michaelmas 1019,) and to equip these, approximately the following jorics will be necessary;-

Questions relative to the finance of the Works&apos; Department created by the Somerset County Council for equipment of small holdings seemed likely to hold ;up the work at the end of August.   A visit to the Council was made by Mr. Vigor and arrangements hav* been agreed to (in consultation with the land Division&apos;and the Ministry of Health), which will, it is hoped, also meet the requirements of similar Works Departments in other Counties,  pux briefly they are as follows1. Objection will not be taken by the Board or by theMinistry of gealth to the proposal of a Council to utilise, temporarily, oounty balances or a bank overdraft, If necessary, for ;    purohase, transport, and labour in conneotion with the purchase and transport, of materials required for the equipment and adaptation of .jmall Holdings under the Land Settlement Scheme.   This is on the ur;der-standing that the materials will be sold to contractors for the ereotion of buildings on small holdings, or will be used by the Works Department, on a prioe basis which shall cover their full cost.

It is proposed to discuss with the Board of Trade the, possibility of restricting imports under tho new legislation which is proposed in regard to dumping.The factory at Xingrs Lynn has been visited and appears to possess a well equipped and very efficient plant.   Tho three factories, when in working order, ^ould consume about 200,000 tons of potatoes per annum, would afford a valuable outlet for small and diseased potatoes unsuitable for human consumption, and would, it is believed, do muoh to encourage i^iicrja^l cultivation of potatoes.Marketing.   EreHmUary enquiries have been made as to the . marketing 7aoT&quot;CItifi&apos;s for fruio and vegetables more especially for small holders at Birmingham.

The Threshing Advisory Committee has now met and considered t&quot;ne question of threshing organisation and rates of payment for threshing operations this season.   It is considered that the threshing&quot;position will be much easier than last year, owing largely to the lighter crops, the transfer of state-Owneft threshing boxes to private ownership, tha release of engines by the Jorage Committee and the return of men from ths Army,   i circular has been&apos;issued to Agricultural Executes Oosmittsos authorising them, wherever neoessary, to reconstitute iilhcoshing a&apos;^b-]omm:i&apos;tt3e3 similar to those set up last year for any of the fallowing uucpo3e3, viz., (IV arranging reasonable rates with local, rspres-.?natives of bha trade, (8) seeing that stacks, belonging to smaller  arrarc3 and on farms in outlying districts are duly threshed, e-nA (3) dividing the county into convenient areas for allotting to&apos; particular threshing sets.   Any important matter in dispute between a [chroahing Sub-Committee and the trade will be referred to the Advisory Committee.The Advisory Committee consider that an advance on the 1914 threshin- rates varying from 100$ to 150$, according to local conditions, is not unreasonable for this season in view of the increased costs of threshing proprietors.Goal for Agricultural Eurposes.   In response to the Circular letter&quot;TOS^57C-2 of 26th August, asking for an estimato of the coal required for agricultural purposes and the rao&amp;t convenient centres for distribution, two estimates (from Bedfordshire and(Cumberland) have been received; several Ocmmitteos have intimated that they expect to have shortly tho particulars asked for.   .7t is hoped that as soon as the estimates are received, the assistance promise ci by the * OcaX,., Mines Department will enable farmers and Steam Tackle owners to obtain&apos; from their coal merchants sufficient steam ooal for agricultural purposes and. particularly for steam cultivation and threehing.

The Board have received recently a large I     numbor of specimens of potatoes disfigured with ordinary scab and in
a few oases diseased with corky scab.    The number of these is not in excess of those of other years and there is no roason to boliovo that such diseases are on the increase.     It is remarkable how little blight has yot appeared on the potato crops, though it has made its appearance in isolated parts of some counties.    Growers, therefore, are expecting to raise a cleaner, if a smaller, crop than usual.v/hero spraying has &quot;been done it has frequently given satis-faction;   a very large number of growers are, however, complaining that the sprayed plants have died off vtfiercas the - unsprayed plants are still green and growing.    The Board are well aware that plants attacked by Aphis will not stand spraying with Burgundy Mixture;   and Aphis attack on potatoes has been widespread this season;   but it as yet is too oarly to say whether the whole damage done by spraying is a result of the spraying on the potatoes previously attacked by Aphis.lotable and Fruit Diseases.Onion Smut.    Another case of this disease has been reported in the Newcastle district, and it is feared that tho disease is more wide-spread here than was thought at first,    The wholo locality is being investigated, with a view to finding a suitable district in which to apply measures for dealing with the disease.Very few diseases of fruit trees or fruit have been reported to the Board during the past week.Ill Live Stock.Rabbits.    Babbit Keepers have made enquiries where good utility rabbits could be purchased.    Addresses of well known breeders have been supplied.    Applications have also been received for tho addresses of local Stud Centres.    All these and other queries have been dealt with during the week.    A considerable number of applications for par-ticulars of breeding, feeding, etc, have been received, and the Board&apos;s leaflets have been dispatched in reply to these queries.pJ^lt V.    It is understood that large quantities of Maize will arrive      England during the month.    This will greatly relieve the feeding      .fttuffs position, which at the moment is causing consider-able anxiety to Poultry Farmers.Members of-the Poultry Advisory Committee have during the week been comparing the cost of feeding stuffs for the present period as compared with August and September of last year.    It is estimated from figures, supported by receipts, that at the present time there is a decrease of 1.08$ in the cost, but against this must be put the increase in the cost of labour.    ilr. Hanson states that his labour costs 25$ more than it did in 1918.The question of a fair price for new laid eggs is still under consideration.A large number of enquiries have boon received for particu-lars of feeding, breeding, etc, together with information relative to the disease of poultry.    Full particulars have been supplied in these cases,Pigs.   Several enquiries hate been received during the week asking for assistance in obtaining a supply of feeding stuffs for pigs during the winter;   it was pointed out by a number of pig keepers that the position will otherwise be very difficult.A complaint was received from a resident in the district cf Custom House, pointing out that the lecal Sanitary Inspector had ordered tho removal of his pigs ,    This matter was investigated by the Loard, and it was found that considerable hardship would be caused by this order, especially as the pig-keeper had taken great
trouble in providing concrete floors for his pigsties.    Tho matter was taken up rath the&apos; Sanitary Inspector, who has promised to withdraw tho Order of ^emuval.Goats .    A number of onauiries liavo been received for tho Board&apos;s leaflets and for addresses whore good milking goats can be obtained.

Sale of Trawlers abroad. An enquiry has been received from the Admiralty as to whether the Board would object to the sale abroad of a trawler built in the year 1907, and also one of two of the more recently constructed trawlers built by the Admiralty. The view communicated to the Admiralty was that the Board has no objection to ? raise to the sale of trawlers abroad of 12 years old and upwards, but that they would depreciate the sale of any men&apos;s recently built trawlers. This view is based upon the possibility that trawler owners may be induced to get rid of their older vessels, and out of the proceeds of the sale equip themselves with the more recently constructed Admiralty trawlers, with the result that the British Fishing Fleet would be adequately equipped to compete with all other nations.

Government assistance in connections with the Autumn Herring Season. A deputation was received by the President on Monday, 1st September, ? from representatives of various interests in the Fishing Trade. The Deputation completed largely of fishermen and boat owners representatives and of only one or two curers. None of the Scotch curers were represented, although they had been invited.

The case for the Deputation was submitted by Mr. Bloomfield who asked that the Government would guarantee 50/- per cran to the Fishermen and 36/- per barrel to the curers for ?, and would then taken over the completed product for disposal in the best market. It was evident from the proceedings that many members of the deputation had not been apprised more than twenty-four hours previously of the general trend of Mr. Bloomfield&apos;s scheme, whicn as a matter of fact, had already been ? early in the year to the curers in Aberdeen, and had been rejected as unsuitable in the case of the summer fishing. It was consequently significant that the Scottish curers had not availed themselves of the opportunity of attending the meeting.

Both the President and the Secretary for Scotland, who were jointly receiving the Deputation, indicated that, with the evidence before them, the Bord were not in a petition to make any recommendation on the subject to the Cabinet, especially in view of the large amount involved, viz, about £2,000,000, and it was recommended to the deputation that they should immediately form a small committee who should get into touch with the Scottish curers, and endeavour to arrive at a cut and ? scheme, showing exactly what was contemplated, and what the liability on the part of the Government amounted to.

The resident pointed out that, in the event of the curers refusing to consider any scheme rather than that which the Government had accepted in the case of the summer herring season, he would be willing to consider any scheme put up by their representatives, if they could produce a written statement that the Scottish curers were not willing to co-operate.

Since the Deputation, a formal scheme has been presented by a Committee of the Trade and has been discussed.   A modified scheme has now been prepared in concert with the Scottish Fishery Board, and has been submitted for consideration by the respective Ministers. Meanwhile the Trade Committee have been invited for another discussion this week.

Deposit of refuse at Poldhu, Cornwall. The Admiralty have consulted this Department with regard to the proposed disposal of about 3,600 ton of sludge (containing a large percentage of oaustic soda), from the Silicol Plant at the Mullion Airship Station. The sludge is to be tipped into the sea over the cliff at Poldhu. Local enquiry is being made as to whether the sludge is likely to injure the fisheries.
