This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.V   , &apos; 0149-    5 ) 7915WAR CABINET.Railway transport and economic conditions insouth russia.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR I circulate for the information of my colleagues a report by Lieut.-Colonel Hull.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.13th September, 1919.TRANSPORT OF FOODSTUFFS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE EKATERINOSLAY AND CRIMEA DISTRICTS.27th July to Uh August, 1919.On the main Ekaterininski railway from Ocheretino to Ekaterinoslav all trains are densely packed with peasants and working-class people, the majority being women, carrying flour to the town where it is selling at 400 roubles per pood but has been as high as 600 to 800 roubles.The trains consist of from 40 to 50 flat cars, open trucks and covered goods wagons. Every type is crowded to absolutely the maximum human carrying capacity possible, including roofs, steps and buffers. The conditions are extraordinary and are the worst yet seen in South Russia.These food transporters are either inhabitants of Ekaterinoslav who have been obtaining or purchasing food for their own supply in the surrounding districts, or are peasants or foodv speculators taking in flour to sell in the town. Each person carries about two poods, or 72 English pounds.This method of food supply and transportation is the worst imaginable both from the economic and transport point of view. It is due to the absolute lack of any public method of supply on the part of the Government and is forced upon the people as otherwise the inhabitants of the towns would starve. It originated under the Bolshevik regime and its continuance under the Volunteer Army government is deplorable. .No steps appear to be taken to organize any system of food collection and distribution as similar conditions have been noted for the past six months, but have reached their culmination in the Ekaterinoslav area.These conditions appear likely to continue and increase as the armies advance into the.districts north of Kursk and the urgency of reform of the present conditions should be represented to General Denikin and measures taken to put some organized system into operation.From the transport point Of view a train of this class utilizes but 10 per cent, of its carrying capacity. It may carry up to 2,000 persons, each with two poods of flour or a total of about 60 tons.   This load could be carried in four wagons instead of forty.The food transporters take from four days upwards to make a journey and travel under the worst sanitary conditions. Station yards are rendered filthy and in the past winter the great increase of the typhus epidemic was greatly due to this congested railway travelling.The relief given to railway transport by an organized system of food collection and distribution would be enormous, and the stoppage of this useless human transport of food would he the greatest help that could be given to the liberated districts.In certain districts about 40 per cent, of the transport capacity of the railways north of Rostov is utilized in this class of traffic, and iu some districts it would be as high as 60 per cent.(B19/418)  70 9/19 H&amp;S  7492wo
It may be stated with certainty that an exceptional harvest has been cut during the past month, the best for many years previous to the war. It will relieve the food situation during the coming winter provided facilities are given to transport it into the industrial areas.The above remark applies to the Kuban district, the Crimea, and the district lying between the Donetz and the Dnyepr and extending north to Kharkov. It is reported that similar excellent crop conditions exist in the Ukraine.The area under cultivation in the districts noted above is at least&apos; 80 per cent, of normal, and it has not suffered owing to the Bolshevik occupation. There is no sign of war or distress caused by the civil war. The land is well cultivated and the population well nourished.Immediately the crops were ripe they were cut and are being harvested.   There is apparently no lack of labour or transport for harvesting. In connection with this labour it should be noted that much of the labour needed for the harshest has been supplied from the towns and payment made in kind, in flour.   Many of the food transporters , have obtained flour in this way, as its purchase with roubles is difficult.It is remarkable that most of the harvest has been cut with machines and throughout the Crimea steam threshers were seen at work in all directions.In the past six months, during inspections of the railways, the economic conditions of the districts visited have been specially noted. Many districts have been visited three or more times and the country covered extends from the Caucasus to Kharkov.The condition of the cultivation and the crops has been noted, and as regards the population in no case have there been signs of poorly nourished adults or children due to lack of food. If any district could be said to show signs of badly nourished adults, some of the railway workers in the Kharkov district might be quoted as the least well-cared for.The difficulty to be faced in the coming winter will be organized transport of food supply to the towns and industrial districts, There will be ample food in South Russia to carry the country through to the next harvest, and if the Government organize a system of purchase and collection from the peasants and transport in bulk to the industrial areas, the transport by rail can be handled without difficulty. If, however; the purchase, collection and transport be left to the individual and speculator, as at present, then the railways will fail to carry the extra 90 per cent, of human freight required for this system of transportation, which will keep up the present inflated prices and breed discontent and Bolshevikism.Officially, in some districts the transportation of food without permits is prohibited, but this prohibition cannot be put into operation as there is no other means of distribu-tion. Also the fact has to be faced that this process of issuing permits for food purchase and transport is in the majority of cases only a means of extortion of bribes.In the area not affected by food transportation there is much casual travelling due to speculation, lack of occupation and the peculiar social conditions. People travel for pleasure in spite of the discomfort of the densely crowded goods wagons, for although food and all commodities are high in price yet there is apparently no lack of money and no sign of poverty in the towns.Officials and workmen in Government employ receive full pay although no work is done. The conditions at Feodosiya station on the Crimea section of the Southern (Government) Bailway may be given as an instance. At this station two trains only are despatched daily, yet the station.staff numbers 110, all of whom receive full pay although the majority do not work. At the locomotive dep6t some 220 workmen are in receipt of full pay but have been idle since 15th April.Such conditions are demoralizing and they exist generally throughout the railway system of South Russia, where, although the present traffic is about one-fifth of that before the revolution, yet staffs and workmen have been retained at full strength and paid full wages.F. N. HULL, Lieut-Colonel, RE., Railway Advisor to the British Military Mission.Melitopol,ith August, 1919.
