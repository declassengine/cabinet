This Document to Property of&quot;&quot; .. ^0 &apos; Hi a Or; ann q ^l:.ij0 3iy*3 Government.,&quot;      U, .   &apos;, L MilMEMORANDUM.BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND THE MINISTER OP HEALTH ON THE NEED OP L.4B0UR FOR THE GOVERNMENT HOUSING PROGRAMME.Tiie Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour have been in consultation in regard to the Labour requirements.of the Housing Frog?aflame contemplated by the former.   These requirements fall under two headings -(a) Labour required for actual building and constructional work, and(b) Labour required for the manufacture and repair of rolling stock for the transport of Building Material.In regard to (a) a careful examination of all available information shows the position to be approximately as followst-The estimated number of employees actually engaged in building and works of construction was in August 1914, -950,000, and is at the present time 750,000, showing a loss of 200,000 men*xOn the credit side of the account there are to be considered -(i)   The number of Building Trade men unemployed in this country.(11) The number of Building Trade men still in the Army and(ill.) The number of Building Trade men who etfe now employed in other occupations.In regard to (i) on the 4th July, 1919, 29,,916 men were registered at the Employment Exchange as available for work in the Building Trade.   This figure la, however,, much In excess of the actual effective supply under thib head as it include a a number of men whose qualifications for the building industry are indifferent or questionable, a number of old and otherwise unfit men, and a further considerable number who would not be prepared to leave the districts in which they reside, and could not reasonably be expected to do so, in view of the general shortage of housing accommodation in the districts where their services will be required.The estimated effective supply of men from the Exchange registers for the purposes of the housing programme may be no more than about 12,000.In regard to (11) there is not available any precise official information as to the actual number of Building Trade men now in the Army, but an estimate based on the aourcaa which are available indicates that this number wouldn&apos;t ,ot exceed 136,000.NO/
No deductions from this figure would he Required in respect of old and unfit men, but there would probably have to be some deductions In respect of men wrongly classified.As regards (lii) it is impossible to make any reliable estimate of the number of Building Trade men who are now employed in other occupations, and the potential&apos;supply from i this course Is a factor which cannot be regarded as appreciably affecting the supply of labour likely to be available for the Housing Programme-It is estimated that the supply of labour required for that programme is 200,000, for England and Wales, and 20,000 for Scotland, making a total of 220,000.   It will thus be seen that even on the maximum assumption of the number of men available in civil life and the number now in the Army, the total is substantially smaller than the minimum number of&quot;men required to carry out the Programme.Accordingly on the fth July, 1919, the Ministry of Labour with the concurrence of. the Ministry of Health wrote to the V/ar Office pressing them to release by the 30th September 1919 all men connected with the Building Trade and Works of Cons-tr^ now In the Army.   In this letter they set forth the general considerations indicated above, and they further pointed out that in view of the attitude of the trades concerned, it would be impossible to increase the number of skilled men available by special arrangements so long as men belonging to these trail remained In the Army.The V/ar Office replied on the 28th July, stating that thsj were unable to comply with this request.   They pointed out thai under Army Order 55, of 1919, a considerable number of the men required will under existing provisions have been released wittl three months of the signing of Peace, and they also referred to the number of demobilised men who are at present unemployed, and might be available.   The inconclusive character of these arguments Is demonstrated at (I) (11) and (iii) above.   But tb main grounds of the War Office objection is the prejudicial effect on the discipline of the army if the principle of releas based upon industrial qualifications were reintroduced-Both the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour fully recognise the force of this argument, but they feel that the necessity of making early progress with the Government Housing Scheme is too vital to be Ignored.   They, therefore, think it necessary to submit the point at issue to the Cabinet for decision.As regards (b) labour for the repair and manufacture of rolling stock the Ministry of Labour has ascertained from the Railway Executive Committee that the number of Railway-men early release from the Army is considered essential for the construction and repair of the necessary rolling stock is 6,lM They have accordingly approached the V/ar Office (again with tin concurrence of the Ministry of Health) with a view to the   J release of the whole of these men by 30th September, 1919.  pof/
of them no doubt will be released as a result of current instructions, but the shortage is so acute that in the view of both Ministries the return of the whole number by that date is essential.The V/ar Office have expressed themselves as unable to comply with this request and will only agree to consider on its merits each case submitted to them. It is understood that their objection is the same as in the case of Building labour; that is to say, the bad effect on the discipline of the army which would be caused by a reversion to the system of release by Industrial groups.This offer by the War Office cannot be regarded as adequate to the situation.   Although such a list as is contemplated could be produced at comparatively short notice (say a month), the process of individual releases on this basis must necessarily be too slow and cumbrous to admit of obtaining the release of any appreciable number of the men in question by the 30th September.Both Ministries consider it of vital Importance that they should be able to rely on the release of all the men in Class (b) as well as the men in Class (a) by September 30th and they urge&apos; the same grounds In support of their view in submitting the matter for the decision of the Cabinet, viz, that the extreme urgency of the housing question demands exceptional treatment for the men who are essential for its solution.(Signed) R.S. HORNE. 5th September 1919.
