of1  tSUPPLY   OF   FOOD   AND   RAW   MATERIALS   TO   GERMANY&quot;MEMORANDUM   BY   THE   FOOD   CONTROLLER,f. Y\0^The Inter-Allied Consultative Fcod Committee has had under consider-ation a list of Food Stuffs and Raw Materials put forward by the Germans as the bare minimum necessary to render them capable of paying reparation. In general, the list does not appear to be excessive in quantity; but it is not possible tc express a final opinion on this until the details of it have been discussed with the Germans.    There is no indication at present as to the extent to which  Germany will be able to finance this programme.    Presumably she will claim facilities for utilising her existing resources for this purpose in accordance with Clause 235 of the Peace Treaty.     In fact, already the Reparation Commission has agreed that  20,000,000 of her securities should be allowed to be realised for the-provision of credits for food purchases in North and South America.- In the present state of world food. supplies-., it is vitally import-ant that Germany&apos;s purchases should be made in.such a manner as not to put up&apos;prices even higher than they are at present.   . This can only beachieved if her purchases are made under the direction of consultation with the&quot;Consultative Food Committee,     This the interests of the Allies:, of America, who is beginning difficulties with regard to high prices, and of purpose it is essential that the Food Committee summon the German, experts to discuss details of Food Committee has venient to have toGermany should be purchasesand in close is alike in to have her ownFor this authorised to with&apos;It.    Theits Headquarters in London and it would be very incon-discuss these matters either in Paris or in Rotterdam,The Committee is, therefore, recommending to the Supreme Economic Council at its meeting on Saturday next at Brussels that.the Germans   should be requested to send their food experts to London, for the purpose of discussing the conditions under which their food purchasesmaybe made i  attach considerable importance from the British point of view, apart from the convenience of Ministers and Officials, to making London the centre at which international consultations.on,economic matters should take place.     Sooner or later the German experts will have to meet the representatives of the Allies in connection with food and other economic matters and since we are now engaged in laying our plans for the coming winter it would be convenient that we.should   know as soon as possible what the German position is, so as to be able to impose conditions for the safeguarding of our own interests.     There may, however, be objections on other grounds to the summoning of German &apos; officials to London at this stage and I submit the matter to the Cabinet for instructions as to the policy to be adopted by the British represent-atives when the matter comes up for discussion at the Supreme Economic Council.&apos;GE0o H. ROBERTS,MINISTRY OF FOOD.17th SEPTEMBER, 1919-.
