re-assembling of Parliament on this Bill, which has been read a second time and stands referred to a Standing Committee.The object of the Sill is to provide compensation for damage to property resulting from subsidence due to mining.     The Bill is to apply to England and Wales and Sootland.Local compensation boards are to be formed for areas in which damage has been or is likely to be caused by subsidence through mining, and those boards are to establish compensation funds by the&apos; levy of a rate on the minerals gotten in the airea, half bt the rate being payable by the mineral owner and half by the mining lessee. Compensation will be payable in respect of damage to houses and buildings and property therein, highways (and tramways &amp;c, thereon), reservoirs, drains, Sewage or&apos; other public works belonging to a local authority.The Bill as originally drafted, proposed that the Local Government Board should be the central Depart-ment for the purposes of the Bill;   I am strongly of opinion, however, that the matter ie not one for the Ministry of Health,    The property in respect of which compensation would be payable under the Bill includes all buildings - business premises, factories, churches, &amp;c., -as well as dwelling&apos;houses.    Tho question involved in the Bill is really one of the relative rights of the owners of particular classes of property - a highly technical matter -on y/hich the staff of the Ministry of Health has no
experience..The Ministry has no duties in relation to mining. The staff of the Department has more than enough to do in attending to the proper functions of the Ministry and is quite unable to undertake extraneous duties.     This Depart-ment is concerned only in so far as Housing Schemes may be affected by subsidence.The Cabinet decided on June 26th (War Cabinet 585 - Minute 3) that the Home Secretary, the Attorney-General and myself should confer as to what should be the policy of the Government towards the Bill and which Depart-ment should be responsible for watching the course of the Bill in the House of Commons.     It was not found possible to arrange this Conference before the Bill came before the Standing Committee, and the absence of any represaEta-tive of the Government at the Committee caused some adverse comment.    At a subsequent meeting of the Committee, I attended at the request of the Leader of the House and explained that the Government could not support the Bill, but would submit proposals of their own to Parliament as soon as practicable;   and.I induced the Committee to adjourn the consideration of the Bill sine die.I suggest that the Cabinet should now give the question their early consideration.     An immediate decision is required to settle which Department should be responsibl for dealing with the matter.C. ADDIS0I7.18. 9, 19.Ministry of Health.
