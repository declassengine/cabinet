PROGRESS OF FARM, WORK.,The first two days of the week were rather wot and junattitable for harvesting .tperations, but the later days, although jshowery. were fairly favourable for this work.   Good progress was Smade with the cutting of grain crops.   The greater part of the oat lortp has been reaped and in some plaoee a considerable proportion has been stacked and threshing has commenced.   There are some reports of oats having become overripe before they could be out. The otikskxh drier weather was eagerly availed of by farmers in many parts of the country to open stooks which had been soaked by the heavy rains.   It is reported that tho yield generally from cereals   will be heavier than was anticipated a short time ago.Pastures continue to&apos; improve, and the result is [apparent in the condition of live stook of all kinds.10/9/19,
Complaints are heai&amp;in a rflrjrber&quot;--of^K^^ tho potatocrop contains a larger proportion than usual of tubers binder marketable size.    Generally the yield is&apos;expected to fall short of last seasons.Root orops have now receoverod to a considerable extent frofc the effects of the doaugMi.   Turnips on the average will probably he a fair crop.The sowing of oatoh  crops is being proceeded with. The very high price *f vetch-seed 1b stated to be militating against   the cultivation of this valuable plant.FLAX.The recent rains hindered somewhat the harvesting of the flax orop and interfered with the drying of the flax after-retting.   The scutching of the 1919 crop is net yet being carried tut to any considerable extent.Tho Department have deoided to train an additional number of flax apprentices for positions as flax Instructors or mill managers.A meeting of the Departments Advisory Committee *w Flax Growing was held in Belfast on the, 5th September^   The principal questions under consideration were-(1) The suggested ourohase by the Government of the necessary flaxseed supplies for sewing in 1980;(S) Resolutions urging that the prioe of 1910 flax Should be raied 10si a stone.(3) The advisability of having semtohers&apos; wages and mlllownors&apos; charges fixed in the coming season.The Department feel oonflldeni that it would reduce the risk of shortage of the right kind of seed, and of a diminished sowing, if the Government wore to putohaso the necessary-supplies.The Department have recommended that the prfioe of flax for the 1919 crop should be restored to what it was in 1918, This would mean an increase of 10s. per stone on the prices already announced for the 1919 flax.
J. t$ t)Arrangements are being made by representatives of the mlllownors to meet representatives of the scutchers at an oarly date.   Pending the outcome of this meeting, it is considered that no action should be taken by the Department in connection with the fixing of charges,MAINTENANCE OP LIVE STOCK*During the period from 2nd to 8th ins tant, inclusive, applications for licences have been reoeived as followst-To slaughter or export heiferB.....&apos;......883To slaughter bulls or bullocks........... 53To slaughter veal Salves.........*....... 36.
