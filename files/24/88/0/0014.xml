Thomas, air. Barnes and Mr, Brownlie are taking part, is very annoying to the extremists, but must have a salutary influenoe on the general body of Labour,The scarcity of houses and alleged profiteering are still the chief causes of unrest.The nationalisation of the coed mines is to be discussed at the &quot;Triple Alliance * Conference on September 4th, It is significant that the Executive Committee of the Miners&quot; Delegates decided against &quot;direct action&quot;,There is bitter feeling about the inoreaae in the prioes of bread and milk.There is some oonsternation in the shipyexdo at the canoeHatioi of the Admiralty orders.Leeds has become a centre of unrest through the activity of the Independent Labour Party and the two Socialist parties.The Union of Democratic Control has almost ceased to exist as .M; a political organisation.The Directors of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; are in great straits for money and are reported to be anxious to dispose of the paper.
THB POLIGB strike the oampuign for raising money for the strikers has drawn  100 from the Lioenaed vehicle Workers and  5 from Mr. Lansbury, who, however, somewhat disingenuously disolaims in the &quot;Herald&quot; any responsibility for the strike,Although general interest in the cawe of the dismissed strikers is reported to be waning in Liverpool, the question of their reinstatement is to be &quot;brought forward by the Liverpool and Birksnhead Labour Parties at ah e.-*rly date. On the other hand, a speaker on the &quot;rlerald&apos;League&quot; platform at Acton said, on September 1st, that the Police were a body of men for whom he did not particularly oare and their grievances did not concern him.iSvidenoe is accumulating that responsible policemen . all over the oountry are muoh relieved at the dismissal of the strikers.THE) HOUSING OUJlfSTiai;.....Reports from various parts of the country indicateprofound dissatisfaction with the apparent failure of the local and central authorities to deal with the housing problem.The Whiteohapel and Distriot Labour Party, in conjunction with the National federation of Discharged and pemobilized Sailors and Soldiers, held a meeting on September 2nd;to protest against the destruction at Stepney of a blook of property, consisting of small shops and&apos;dwelling houses, , * .   , to make, room for a Cinematograph Theatre,   k resolution reg,;irdin^ the protest was sent to the Member for the constituency.   It is interesting to note that a similar situation has ariuen at Maidstone where it is -proposed to ., erect a Oinei^atograph Ttieatre which will necessitate the ejectment of twelve families.   In this oase, however, theplan/
plan, though aooepted by the looal Council, is being laid before the Ministry of Health.My correspondent reports that there is considerable irritation in Liverpool regarding a hitch in the looal housing scheme.   The Liverpool Housing Committee had offer to purchase certain Army huts for conversion into dwelling houses.   The Ministry of Health has now refused definitely to sanotion the scheme, and the huts are to be put up for sale this week.   Some 140 demobilized soldiers who had registered for accommodation are affected by this decision,It is also reported that in the Manchester District the Ministry of Health is generally held responsible for the delay in the erection of houses.In Nottingham and Derby there is a shortage of briok-layers and a growing demand for dilution of labour in the building trade,THfi NATIONALISATION OF Mfl COAL kllifiSThe Miners&apos; nationalisation campaign has slowed down pending the meeting of the JSxecutive Committee of the Mine Federation of Great Britain on September 2nd, that of the Delegates on September 3rd, and the full conference of the Triple Allianoe whioh follows on September 4th,The gravity oannot be denied of the recommendation made by the Executive Committee to the Conferenoe of Mine Delegates to reject the Government schemes for the manag ment and ownership of the mines, while equal importance attaches to the resolution regretting that &quot;the Governinen has no better scheme than the oreation of great trusts to seoure the eoonomio well-being of the industry.&quot;It is, however, significant of the reoent movement^ towards constitutional prooedure that the Committee deotf against &quot;direot action&quot;;THS/
- 3 - 42(English)THE COST OP LIVINGThe aim ounosmsnt b regarding--t^e^prioe^f^^ead^and milk have oausGci b.ltter oomment and there appears to be a general fooling\-.hat the inorease is not justified.   It is suggested that the publication of the. figures upon whioh the inorea3e is based might alleviate the irritation,        &apos;In.Liverpool there is active discontent, and the workers state that they.will not accept the increase &quot;lying down&quot;.,. They consider, moreover, that ample time has elapsed since the passing of the Profiteering Aot for the formation of a local tribunal, of whioh there .   , is as ye,t no sign. ...THE TRADE UNION COKGRSqq.On September 2nd the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Qoagrsss began,its sittings, in preparation . for the fall Congreg.3. ; The increase in the membership of the Congressduring the war is re.narkable; this year 835 delegates will represent 4,900,000 workers, whereas in 1913 135 delegates represented 2,217,836.   The inorease is due, not sc.much to an influx of new sooieties, as to the, -growth, of the component unions.The following unions show the biggest increase in membershipGeneral Workers Union 80,000 Agricultural Labourers Union    04,000 (Membership in previous year only 36 1000).Garment Workers 22,000.    Tailors 11,000 Card and Blowing RoomOperatives 11,000Dookers 18,000&apos; A .S.E. 20,000National Union of labour 10,000Electrical Trades 12,000Boot and Shoe Operatives 14,000Women Workers 10,000Shop Assistants 11,000 India Rubber, Cable andAsbestos Workers 18,000Textile/
Textile Workers Railway Clerks22,000 16,000 18,000 10,000Printing and Paper TradesBookbindersIron and SteelConfederation22,000The agenda for the Congress, which have been published oover a wide field, but differ little from those of previous years.   Mr. Brownlie^ letter to the secretary, urging increased produotion, is likely to be considered of oapital importance arid will probably provoke lively disoussion.CANCELLATION OF ADMIRALTY OaPJSRS FOR ships the reoent order to stop all work on warships building at various shipyards has given rise to anxiety amongst the workers affected.   It is estimated that delay must ensue before the men oan be re-absorfced in mercantile work.In the Barrow yards the men are arranging for representation to be made to the authorities.   It is urged that unless the decision be resoinded, unemployment will become aoute in the town.LEEDS district the Socialist Labour Party are said to be describing local Soviets to their Leeds audiences, while Socialist literature is finding an excellent market.The activity of the Independent Labour Party, British Socialist Party and Sooialist labour Party in this area it marked. During the week, meetings have been held nightly at Leeds, Bradford and Sheffield, arid branch meetings have taken plaoe on different evenings at smaller places.3 r. Robert Riohaxdson, &amp;.P., and air. F. Hall, M.P., have addressed various miners1 meetings, denounced the Government in vigorous terms and were well received.Mr. Ben Turner, J.P.. and Mr. W. Lunn, M.P., address a/
(English)a  demonstration of some 3,000 miners and textile wbikers at Bat ley on August 31st.   Both speakers supported nationalisation and oritioised the Government.   ,,(f. Kneeehaw, the Birmingham extremist, was also in the area during the week-end.My correspondent reports that there has been a general outory in the distriot against intervention in Russia, while &amp;r. Churchill is accused of a deliberate lie in regard to the proposed withdrawal of British forces from Archangel.warnMoManuS, John McLean, UoJSwan, Aldred and Miss Sylvia Pankhurst have recently visited Rosyth, where they delivered inflammatory speeches, urging the workers to organise and prepare for the revolution.Copies of the leaflet HTo Seamen&quot; were found in the Dockyard, and James Graham, a worker in the Electrical -Engineers1 department, was discharged for having several ooples in his possession. Graham is on agitator who had endeavoured previously to cause discontent regarding the reauotion of staff in his department.Information regarding the new Boale of allowances for disabled men in reoeipt of industrial training and the extension of the unemployment donation does not seem to have reaohed the mss of ex-3ervioe men.   Wide publicity would go far to counteract the various movements for increased pay.There is evidence from Nottingham of a new movement in oonneotion with the &quot;Z&quot; reserve.   It is claimed by the local branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers that, as the men in thin class are liableto/
&quot;to-rbo-T^^t^^ they should be paid on thebasis of the First Class Army.Reserve.   A.national demonstration is to bo arranged for Septeaber,27th in order that this demand :aay be put forward-. ; ... On September ^st a ^deputation from the Comrades of the v,     . -    Great War.- and the ,looal... i^dera^ipn, of pieohar^oc: end.....

They, also asked, that ex-service men should take the place o .wo.aen in the Corporation (departments. -The Sheffield Branch of the Federation have passed a resolution -assuring tU\ -Pteamways and Vehicle Workers&apos; Unio: :that,-if any dispute arises .concerning women labour&apos; on the TZm 3   Tramways, the -organization will stand by the. Union and wil . not..supply &quot;blacklegM labour.1    In Liverpool there is reported to be strong feeling amongst ex-soldiers:against the employment of women in Government offices.There has i^t^^Q^^f^i^^1^^^^. strike ?at^the Campbell Gas Engine Company, Halifax, which has been in progress for six weeks,   The firm has advertised lor &quot;Ex-soldiers, Sailors and others, amounting to&quot; several hundreds ..... to take tile places of men now 6n strike because we undertook at the request of the Government to train some ex-soldiers as engineers,&quot;&quot;   kr. Campbell, in oonjunotion with the leaders of the discharged men&apos;s associations, is working to break the strike and has beetf successful in his offer of ilOO for the: amalgamation oftwo/
twa *T*odJUne&apos;*e^vt^^        ^KuobJUMjneaberribdi&apos;-&quot; of* 1400 can be used to rout the mass piokets.  But feeling is running high in the town and should the ex-soldiers take definite action it is possible that the strike will extend to other engineering shops.Owing to the publicity given by the Bulletin of the Discharged galdiers and Sailors to the Anti-Bolshevik film whioh they are producing, there is a movement in the Cinema Operators Branoh of the Electrical Trades Union not to handle such films, on the ground that they core &quot;attacks on trades unions&quot;.   It will be unfortunate if this movement spreads.From August 24th to 31st, Mrs, Bssant, supported by B.P. Wadia, P.K. Telang and Jamnadas Dwarkadas^ was engaged in a Home Rule for India campaign in Lancashire.  Meetings were held at Preston, Liverpool, Birkenhead, Wigan, Boohdale, Burnley, Bolton and ifanohester, under the auspices of the local Labour Parties and Trades Counoils.   The speeohes call for no special comment in that they followed the lines usually prescribed by Mrs. Besant.A well attended meeting was held in the Bisex Hall on September 1st to protest against the imposition of martial law in the Pubjab and elsewhere in India.  Ths speakers were George Lane bury, B, Ch Tilak, B.G. Homiman and Commander Kenworthy, M.P.  Ske first and last named urged the Indians present to speak to the masses in the great cities who are debarred from hearing the truth by the Capitalist Press,THE/
HI   O   *THE UNION OP DEMOCRATIC CQNTROfrI am&quot; inforrcaed that the Union of democratic Control is almost in a state of collapse and that it will exist shortly only as an information centre.JOHN MaOLBAWThis man made very violent speeohes at Rosyth and Dunfermline on August 10th and 12th.   Copies of his speeohes have been sent to the Lord Advocate for consideration.COLONEL WEDGWOOD. ^.P. *Colonel Wedgwood,;who has ti large following in the Pottery distriot, has been addressing Independent Labour Party meetings in that area.   His speeohes are violent attacks upon the Government, but contain no constructive proposals.&quot;THE DAILY xiii3iULDMThe present position of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is that the circulation approaches half a million, but this is greatly to the disadvantage of the paper financially, for the advertisement receipts amount to less than  90 a week, while the bill for printing and paper is  60 a day.   It h&amp;B been ascertained - that i4r. Lansbury would be glad to dispose of the paper for a very moderate sum.It is significant that i&amp;r. FRAHCIS IViEYNELL, a director and shareholder; who went to Denmark on the invitation of the Danish Foreign Offloe, left his party at Copenhagen and went to Stockholm, ostensibly to buy paper for the &quot;Herald&quot; It must be remembered that the Extremist Party in Stookholfl has j-ateiy sent money to Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, and it seemore/
(English)more than likely that Mr. Meynell was endeavouring to raiM funds for the &quot;Herald11 from the same souroe.1RBLAMDAt the Annual Meeting of the Supreme Oounoil of Sinn Fein in Dublin on August 21st, the Secretary said that there were 1820 Sinn ite in Clubs in the United Kingdom, but not 4$ of these had paid their membership fees for the ourrentyear;,vA settlement haB been reached in the protracted dispute between the farmers and labourers in County Kildare,   The question of union arid non-union labourers working together is to be reserved for the present.The dispute in County Oalway is also settled on Bome-what less advantageous terms and a partial agreement has been reached on the borders of Carlow and Wicklow.Sinn ?ein and the Irish Labour leaders appear to have- . fixed their hopes on the development of a serious industrial situation in England, and the &quot;delay&quot; has caused some disappointment.   &quot;The Voioe of labour&quot; published an article by Sylvia Pankhurst on &quot;The rising tide of discontent in -England&quot;, with the obviouB intention of keeping the question to the fore,   This article is being circulated in other forms.   The paper also urges the formation of one big Union and the land for all the people,It is expeoted that a flood of Sinn Pein literature, which is supposed to be coming from Glasgow, will be distributed in Ireland during the winter.In the case of the boy Murphy, who was shot at Bnnistymon, County Clare, a verdiot of wilful murder against some soldiers unknown was brought in, but there was no convincing evidence to justify such a verdict,  iiuoh capitalwas/
was made out of the finding of a service bullet in the house, but it muttt be remembered that the Irish Volunteers possess iiili^riixy arms and ammunition,There (\re signs of, labour trouble in Belfast and the carpenters, joiners and:other allied trades.are demanding increased wages, which the employers. say: they oajinot afford, The various traces in the shipyards are also said to be in a state of uneasiness but the 44 hour week is not one of thi bones of contention,An American priest, whose n^me,is not given, is.now in Ireland with letters.of introdaotion from de Valera to prominent Sinn Pelners. iils mission is, to ascertain the exact feeling of the Country towards. Dominion Home Rule, which, in his view, would be acceptable to de Valera and most of his American followers.this priest naturally maintains that de Valerals mission is a great suooess - not only in arousing pro-Irish and anti.- ritish feeling and opposition to ratification of the ^o^fjCreftty...,^ also,.as regards the large sum of money which is being oolleoted.  He says de Valera will rem.ln in America about 4 months longer.: : I nave, reoelveu from Amerioa a filii. showing de Valera&apos;s reception in Boston and tfona^auoisoo.
