big DOCUlIBflT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S OOVEMIjEiW).SECRET. rAR.CABINET..T.8179A.COMMAND OF CONSTANTINOPLE.Memorandum communicated by the Prime Minister Clemenceau, lath September 1919.(1) If it is desired to make an historical survey ofthe causes which led to the present occupation of Constantin-ople, it is necessary to begin earlier than the attached paper.   The salient fact about Turkey is that it was conquered by the British arrdes, and that at least nine-tenths of the blood and treasure spent in the war against Turkey was found by the British Empire.    The great victories which finally brought Turkey to her knees in 1918 were gaihetf almost exclusively by the British and Native forces of the British Empire under Field-Marshal Lord Allenby.   Nor were these great exertions against the Empire of Turkey accompanied by any weakening of the efforts of the British armies to sustain their French comrades on the Western battlefields.    On the contrary, while these victories in the East were being gained, the British armies in Franco and Flanders during the years 1917 and J.918 suffered much heavier casualties and made greater captures both in prisoners and guns from the Germans than any other army in the Western theatre.   The effort which struck down Turkey was in the main an effort of the Oriental and Indian portions of the British Empire and was 11 no way achieved at the expense of the effort of the British armies in France.   But for that effort Turkish troops in very large numbers would assuredly have appeared on the Western battle-fields.(2) The British forces at present in Turkey are described in this paper as amounting only to one feeble division,   As a matter of fact in the army of the Black Sea alone there are at present more than 50,000 men.    It is quite true that all of these are not in the neighbourhood of Constantinople, some being in the forts of the Narrows and a considerable., portion in the &apos;Caucasus.    It is pointed out that the French troops in Constantinople will shortly be augmented by divisions brought back from Bulgaria and from Hungary.   It is not known for what purpose this addition to the garrison of the Constantinople district is to be made.   No reason known to the British military authorities requires or justifies such a step. &apos; If more troops were needed they could easily be found from the British troops now coming back from the Caucasus, the evacuation of which is proceeding from day to day with the utmost rapidity.   Moreover large reserves of.British and Indian troops are available at short notice in Egypt and Palestine./ It must also be remembered that the British have in Syria and Cilicia,at the present time no fewer than 55,000 troops who are engaged in maintaining order in difficult circumstances in provinces in which the British have never intended or desired to remain.   And in any enumeration of the relative forces available at Constantinople, the British forces en^a^ed in holding Syria until French troops are ready to replace them must certainly be taken into consideration.
The naval forces maintained,by Great Britain in the Black Sea and in the Eastern Mediterranean, end the part played by these forces in the events of the lest few months, must also be taken Into consideration in any comparison of the relative contributions of the Groat Powers concerned v-hich it may be necessary to make.The question of the arrangements vhich should be made pending the final decision of the Allied Powers as to the future of Constantinople,and of Turkey in general could not in any case be decided-by a&apos;mere balancing of numbers.   The British Government have maintained, are maintaining and are prepared to met ntain in this sphere whatever troops are necessary during the interim period.(5) The relative roles T&quot;hich It is suggested should be assigned to the French and British Commanders during the interim period should be examined.,Firstly, the command-in chief in Palestine and Syria is exercised by the British only until the French choose te take over their agreed sphere of responsibilities.Secondly, the command-In-chief of the Asiatic portions of the Ottoman Empire is indeed an exceedingly sterile and thankless function.   It consists In the first place of Great Britain having been compelled against her Interests and against her will to maintain ror eight months at great expense an Army Corps in the Caucasus.   From this Britain is now with-drawing after having vainly endeavoured to persuade the. Italians or the Americans to undertake the responsibilities ^hich we have hitherto discharged there at so much cost and inconvenience.Thirdly, General Milne has been deputed by the Peace Conference in spite of the protests of the Far Office, to discharge the still more thankless and indeed odious ta^k of endeavouring to mitigate and modify the quarrels which ate proceeding between the Italians and Greeks and between the Italians and the greeks and the Turks.On the other hand, it is suggested that it is a fair offset to these burdens that France should for her part enter into absolute control of Constantinople and of all the allied troops In that region, including a British force which apparent-ly Is neither to be aiove nnr below the strength of a Division,, and that the British Commanders are to quit the Turkish capital and transfer themselves to some unspecified town In Asiatic Turkey.   It is needless to observe that such a proceeding would strike a fatal blo,r&apos; at British prestige not only in Constantin-cple but throughout the Turkish Empire and -quid be accepted by the Mahommedans in every part of the ^orld as a humiliation of the most glaring kind inflicted on the British power.   Having regard to the fact that Great Britain is incomparably the greatest Mahommedan po^er in the ^orld, and has at this moment on the soil of the late Turkish Empire, including large reserves in Egypt, between three and four hundred thousand men, such a proposal could not be accepted.It /night well be the signal for risings against the British authority in many parts of the Turkish Empire xihiah. would endanger the safety of our troops and could only be extinguished by the shedding of blood. .
(4) Although the position in Constantinople during th$ interim period before final arrangements oan be agreed upon between the Great Powers assigns * and rightly assigns * the primacy to Great Britain, France is at nfl disadvantage in&apos; this respect.   For all the British armies in France and Flanders are and have long been placed under the supreme command of a French Generalissimo from whom at this moment ^ur Commanders a^ait their orders.15th Sept. 1919.
