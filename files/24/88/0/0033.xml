(Seotion 13 (5) ).Where the power of purchasing privately-owned, wagons or of prohibiting- or restricting their use or of limiting the number of wagons to bo so used is exercised, the reasonable facilities which a Hallway Company is bound to afford under the Railr/ay 2s Canal Traffio Act 1854 are to be deemed to include the provision of suitable railway
wagons, and the Minister must sb eacerolee his powers of working or disposing of the wagons purchased as to enable Railway CoaQinies to fulfil their obligations under this provision as fully as may be practicable (Section 18(4)(a)),With respect to the use of wagons so acquired, a Hallway Company may oharge such sums as the Minister may direct (Section 13(4)(b)).Any oapltal sum payable for the purchase of privately-owned railway wagons may be discharged, in whole or in part, if the Treasury so direct, by the issue of securities, the amount of such securities equivalent to such capital sum being, in default of agreement, determined by the Railway and Canal Commission,   (Section 14(1)),The arguments against multifarious ownership ef wagons and in favour of common ownership and common user are wellknown and need hardly be repeated in this Memorandum, and there seems every reason for thinking that a purchase on fair terms would not only conduce to more efficient and eoonomi^oal traffic working but would also enhance the revenue earning capacity of the railway systems,,  ITo definite estimates, however, are available at the present time of the financial advantages which would be attained by the abolition tf privatelynowned wagons, but the saving in.the cost of shunting which would result, oombined with tho increased earning powers of the Hallway Companies, leaves no ground for thinking that the net result achieved by the purohe^e woulci not show a very substantial increment to the State in the revenue oaming capacity of the Uailway Companies.The total number of privately*-owned railway wagons is
about 640,000 end it is estimated that, on a fair basis, the cost of purchase of the total number would not exceed  70,000,000. after allowing for interest at 5$ and a fair sum for repairs and renewals, based on present-day prices, and with reasonable charges for their use on present day values, it is considered that a net gain of from  8,000,000 to  3,000,000 per annum ought to result from the purchase.^,Assuming that the question of the abolition of privately-owned wagons is agreed in principle and their purchase by the State 1b authorised, a further important question immediately arises a*i to whether an oh wagons are to remain the property of the State or are to become the property of the Railway Compmiee.   As has already been pointed out, when the purchase is oomplete the Minister is empowered -(a) to woxfc the wagons,(b) to lease the wagons,(o) to apportion the wagons among the several Railway undertakings.If either of the first two alternatives be adopted, thewagons must obviously remain the property of the State and verydifficult end complicated questions will arise as to the method bywhich the wagons are to be worked and the steps that must be taken toensure that they are properly maintained and renewal.   Further,state ownership of the wagons, involving, as it would, State financial interest in railway material of great magnitude (possible  70,000,0OQ),combined with the very close supervision which the State would he*e toexercise in order to secure that the wagons were properly used and maintained, might have an important bearing upon the issue which will arise in the future as to whether or not the railway undertakings of theCountry are to be acquired by the State, tan issue which I apprehendthe Government will not desire to prejudice at the present time by any
-    101steps which may he taken in connection with the future of prlvately*.$wned railway wagona,    $he third alternative la to apportion the wagons among tho oevoral rallvmy unaertakdngs as their own property, and thia aeemo to me to be the wisest and moat aoonomieal oourse to adopts provided euitable arrangements, financial and otherwise, can be come to with the Railway Companies, an&amp; it must alao be borne in mind that on the exeroiee of the power of purchase, the Hallway Comflwaiea will assume certain responsibilities for the provision of a supply of suitable railway wagons * to the trades concerned, and they must, as far as possible, be put into a position to fulfil their obligations, Aocredited witnesses on behalf of the Hallway Com&amp;anlss who have given evidence at recent public enquiries, have spoken in favour of the jorinolple of the abolition of the privately-owned wagon, and there therefore does not seem to be any reason for thinking that the Eailway Companies will be adverse to the adoption of this third $iterative, provided that fair financial terms can be arranged and that tho State will render suoh assistance as may be necessary in regard to the provision of the necessary fends or the raising of the additional oapltal required, I therefore recommend(1)   IDhat the Cabinet should agree in principlei *with the acquisition of all privately-owned ( wagons, %(S)  5?hat, if thoy are acquired, ownership should * not remain with tho State, and that, before steps in the direction of acquisition are taken, an endavour should be made to come to j terms with the Eailway Companies as to thedisposal of the wagons and as to the financial arrangements that are necessary,(3gd) Eric Geddes.
