As212[This Document is the   Property of His Britannic Kajeaty^e Government) .WAR CABINET.st.8167.&quot;Autumn Herring Fishery;   Government assistance&quot;.-memorandum by the president  of the Board of Agriculture and fisheries and The Secretary for Scotland.Urgent representations have been made to us , by deputation and otherwise, that the assistance given by the Government to the herring fishing industry in respect of the summer herring fishery should be extended in a revised form to the great autumn herring fishery whioh akes plaoe in the neighbourhood of Yarmouth and Loweetoft.   It had been hoped that the scheme under which the summer herring fishery was con-ducted would have secured for the fisherman a minimum price for his herrings which would represent at least a living wage.   I7e are satisfied that in practice the fishermen did not receive a living wage, and that many ft the boats, a large proportion of which are owned by fishermen, finished the season in debt.   The whole position has, therefore, had to m reconsidered and, as a result, we feel bound to recommend to the ffabinet the adoption of a new scheme, the details of which are attached. In doing so we would point out that the men whom the scheme is designed jo benefit are mainly those who served in the Auxiliary Patrol and to lomo extent in the Mine-sweepers during the war.   Responsible Ministers jrid highly placed officers of the Navy have borne repeated testimony to he value of the heroic services of these fishermen.   In view of this we ish to urge upon our colleagues that they should not allow the government to be laid open to the imputation that when the war was over, ind the survivors returned to their peace-time pursuits, it declined to secure them a living wage in return for their industry.Not only have the men deserved well of their country, but the Industry ia one of great importance to the nation.(l)   The herring industry is one of the greatest food-producing adustries of the country, both for home and export purposes.   The iglish autumn herring fishery is especially important, and is carried by practically the whole of the English and Scottish drifter fleets. 193.3 the Lowostoft and Yarmouth cat oh, in the last three months of year, amounted to 70 per cent, of the total herring catch of England Wales.(2)   The representatives of the fishermen of both countries declare iat it is not worth their while to go to sea unlesB they are assured /- per cran for their fiah.   They contend that any lower price will t yield them a living wage.   &quot;While we are disposed to th::nk $hadb-in neral terms the statement is not exaggerated, we believe that *&apos;;re ebermen would be induced to go to sea by a guaranteed price of 45/-, A that this guaranteed minimum, coupled with the increase whixh may be icted through competition when the landings are small, would ensure more than a bare living wage,^A careful estimation of the current expenses leads us to the inclusion that on an average catch the weekly wage result to the [Sherman for the 12 weeks&apos; fishing would be:-   on fish at 45/- per fan,  2. 19. 0. and on fish at 50/- per cran, .53. 9. 0.   It must be
remembered that the herring fishery is seasonal, and the fisherman expects to make during the summer and autumn fishery sufficient now merely to provide him with a livelihood during the fishing, but to tide him over the loan months of the winter.(3)   If the minimum price, is denied them, and the fishermen persist in their resolution, the whole of the fishermen normally engaged in this fishing, Scottish and jJnglish, may be thrown upon the resources of the unemployment benefit.   This will involve an estimated oost of at least  350,000, without taking into account those thrown out of work in subsidiary industries.(4)   The stoppage of fishing would mean a collapse of the industry, which would be felt for yearB to cone.   There is also the prospect of the cured herring trade falling partly or wholly, (in the case of the trade with Germany at all events)f into the hands of the foreigner, e.g. the Norwegian and Dutch.(5)   The stoppage of fishing would also result in the complete stoppage of the supply of fresh herrings, kippers and bloaters for home consumption, which in a normal year absorbs approximately one-fifth of the total catch.   Without the curing trade to fall back upon it would not pay the fishermen to fish merely in ord&apos;?r to provide the supplies required for home consumption.   At best there would be a very limited supply at a greatly inflated price.The nation would thus be deprived of a wholesome form of food rhich is at present a strong competitor with and.an excellent sub-Btitute for imported bacon, and t^ere would at the Bame time be a fall in. the export trade, which on national and financial grounds it is important to maintain.(6)   Apart from the mere payment of the unemployment, benefit, there wmld be a grave risk, if there is a general stoppage of fishing, of many fishermen going out of the industry as a profession altogether.   In fact, many are already reported to have abandoned the uncertainty of fishing for the comparative security of the unemployment benefit.(7)   .hren if the fishermen were willing to go to sea, the ownere, . a majority of whom are working fishermen, cannot afford to run their vessels unless they are assured of a price sufficient to secure them against loss.This price must necessarily be higher than in normal times, , owing to the greatly increased cost of coal, nets, and other supplies.! and to the fact that-owners arc now compelled to make to their crews advances which, in .the Tight of recent experience, have not been covered by the prices realised.It will be observed that it is proposed under the scheme to guarantee to the curer a certain price per barrel intended to represent the. actual cost of the herrings at a minimum of 45/- per cran. and his. actual working expenses which we &quot;are satisfied will not amount in the ordinary course to less than 32/* per barrel.   The curer is brought into the scheme because it cannot be worked without his co-operation.In conclusion, wo wish again to emphasise that the.scheme is framed for the benefit of fishermen, the majority of whom are but lately returned from war service, &quot;We have met and fully discussed the atter with their representatives, and are impressed by the case they ave submitted to us and by their faith in the justice of their claim.
It is inconceivable to them that the Government should alley/ large numherB of fishermen to he&apos;thrown out of employment, through abnormal and temporary circumstances over which they have ho controlj after the invaluable, services they have rendered during the war.   They claim that when asked by the State for their services and their boats for war purposes, they gave them freely and ungrudgingly, and $hat they are now entitled to expect that, when.they are required to work and to produce food by their labours, the State will at least secure them against the ruin of their industry.ROBERT MUNROi17th September, 1919.
D3TAILS OF THU SCHEME FOR GOVgMggT ASSISTANCE1.    The Government to undertake to purchase from the curers, subject to the.conditions that follow, barrels of cured herrings at , 3. 6. 6, per barrel in the case of gutted herrings and  2. 19. 6. per barrel in the case of ungutted herrings.2.    Purchases to be limited to a maximum of 500,000 barrels in the case of gutted, and 100,000 barrels in the case of the ungutted fish. &quot;      &quot;3,    Purchases to be subject to the condition that the curer has paid to the fishermen, in the case of all herrings cured by him, the sum of 45/- per cran.4.    The Government to make an advance to the curer, on acceptance of each consignment of barrels, of a sum equivalent to the agreed purchase price less 5/- per barrel, the last-mentioned sum to be paid on shipment&apos;of the barrels for Bale abroad.5.    Gurers to undertake storage of all   oarrels purchased by the Government, and to keep them in good condition, until arrangements can be completed for their shipment abroad.6.    The scheme tube carried out by an Executive Council comprising, inter alia, representatives of the two Government Fishery Departments and of the fisheimen.   The Council   -(a) to effect the purchase of all barrels taken overby the Government;(b) to conduct the sale abroad of all such barrelson the Government1s behalf;(c) otherwise to make all arrangements deemed advisablein connection with the autumn fishing operations.7.    The Executive Council to provide its own clerical assistance(except in the case of an expert accountant to be supplied by theBoard], and its own office accommodation.   All expenses incurred to be borne by the Trade.8.    All profit made by the Government on the sale of its barrels to be divided equally, upon the final completion of the sale, between the Government, the curer and the fishermen.   Before profits are divided the interest contracted on the money advanced by the Government will be deducted.The maximum liability involved in the above scheme, in the event of the State being unable to dispose of any of in the herrings,, would amount to&quot;: -By purchase of 500,000 barrels (gutted)at  3. 6.6. per barrel............... 1,662,500By purchase of 100,000 barrels (ungutted)at  2. 19. 6. per barrel ............297. 500Total  .       1,950.-000**N0T3: This sum includes a sum of &quot;1,022,625 representing the guaranteed price of 45/- per cran to the fisherman.
On the other hand the experience of the Scottish Summer Herring scheme, approved earlier in the year, encourages the hope that not only would the State not be involved in any loos at all but would, in all probability, make a profit.15th September, 1919.
