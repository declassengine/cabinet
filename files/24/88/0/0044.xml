The overwhelming majority at the Glasgow   &amp; Conference in favour of nationalisation was confessedly an attempt to bring pressure to bear on the Government.  Being a card vote.   1 probably it does not at all represent the real views of labour if it oame to voting for direot action in support of nationalisation, nor, indeed, for nationalisation itself if it entails higher prices for coal,Profiteering and higb prices are still primary causes of unrest, though it is said that shopkeepers are lowering their prices a little for fear of being brought under a charge of profiteering.Discontent regarding the lack of houses shows no abatement. : At Manchester and Liverpool, however, a good effect has been produoed by the signs of activity on the part of the Municipal Authorities. :Labour men and Socialists are pushing on with their preparations for Parliamentary and Munioipal Elections.Efforts are being made to start new Labour papers in Birmingham, Cardiff and Leeds. 5The deputation of responsible Labour leaders who stated that British Labour would not participate in the Meeting in Washington unless German Labour representatives were present, is an Indication of the line they are likely to take respecting solidarity with German &quot;Labour.  The German delegates likely to be selected for Washington would be those who attended the Conference at Jtmsterdam.
MB POLICEHayes, Secretary of the Polioe Union, reoently addressed the  test London Workers Committee, whioh is supporting the Union for its own ends,The Union leaders are going to make a last effort at tlie  Trade Union Congress to seoure the support of Labour, but their oase has been damaged by the revelations of ex-Inspector Syme in the current issue of &quot;Forward&quot;, Mr. Syme declares that the strike and its failure were due to the false statements made by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and by the president and Secretary of the police Union? and ,he further alleges that0the ballot of the members of the Union last ^ay was &quot;faked&quot;.   Other assertions against the leaders of the Police union are that, prior to the ballot, they falsely declared to the members that the Miners1 Federation had voted  100,000 towards a strike fund; that the Triple Alliance had given a pledge in writing to ooxae Out on strike &apos;.,  in support of the Police Union; and.that &quot;Bob Smillie has been given an open cheque by the miners to fill in whatever sum he likes for our.support.&quot;The National Union of General Workers reoently contributed  50 to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; Polioe Fund.   Other smaller sums have been received,It 1b reported that the united labourers&apos; Union will claim urgency for a resolution calling on all societies affiliated to the Trade union Congress to make a levy of 6d. per member in aid of the funds of the Polioe Union, and- directing the Parliamentary Committee of the Congress to make strong representations to the Government to have the Polioe Aot withdrawn.All the members of the Pembrokeshire County Constabulary have resigned from the Union as have the Merthyr Polioe.Bootle/

He suggested that the police had been used in th past for improper work&apos;, but there was evidence that this was going to end.There is some discussion as to the admission of poll Btrikers into the I.

Division of the Labour Party intends to publish a new labour weekly for propaganda purposes, probably under the title of the "Cardiff Citizen." The editor, Arthur J. Williams, is organising secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen for Wales.

In consequence of complaints that "The Daily Herald" does not cater for local labour news, the Birmingham Central Labour Party intend to issue a weekly paper for the district.  The guarantee fund is fixed at £250 and it is reported that a fair proportion of this sum has already been secured. If the remainder can be obtained, the paper, to be called "The Town Crier", will be issued in the first week of October.

IRELAND

The occurrences at Fermoy on Sunday and Monday evening are likely to produce some heart-searchings among the more responsible of the Sinn Fein leaders. Th indignation of the soldiers on hearing that the Jury had failed to bring in a verdict of murder against the persons who shot the soldiers going into church was no doubt the inciting cause for the disorders on Monday evening, for they paid particular attention to the shop of the foreman of the Jury.

There is no change in the general situation, but discontent exists among the younger members of the Irish Volunteers at the inactivity of the Sinn Fein Executive. Malcontents have agreed to be guided by the views of the members of the "Dail Eireann" until de Valera returns from America. The "Dail Eireann" announces the launching of a National Loan of £250,000, the bonds to be issued in denominations of  £1, £5, £10, £50, and £100.

Two seditious posters were found pasted up in Lisdoonvarna, Co. Clare, and in Macroom, Co. Cork. The

former/


former is headed &quot;REPUBLICAN PROCLAMATION&quot; and is signed&quot;COMPETENT MILITARY AUTHORITY&quot;.   It deolares certain offences,;such as friendly communication with the Polioe or Military,to be High Treason, and orders informants to report them toOfficers of the Irish Republican Army.  The second poster issigned &quot;0.0.0., WESTERN COMMAND, I.R.A*.   It is directed against the Royal Irish Constabulary, and concludes as follows&quot;THIS IS NOT AN APPEAL BUT AN ORDER  ROM THE IRISH &quot;REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT,   TO THOSE WHO IGNORE IT &quot;WILL HE METED THE PUNISHMENT. OP TRAITORS, &quot;FRATERNISING WITH THE ENEMY CANNOT BE TOLERATED&quot;,The Sinn Fein press has been ohiefly interested this weokwith the abolition of the Censorship.   &quot;The Voioe of labour&quot;says that the real Censorship is now in the hands of thel&amp;litary Authorities,B.
