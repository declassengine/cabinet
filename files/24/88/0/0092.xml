The ssnner in which the more important resolutions are translated into action will indicate the increase or decrease of the revolutionary movement in this country.   There has undoubtedly been a large increase of revolutionary sentiment, but it takes the form of a determination to alter the conditions of industrialism.   In other words, a majority of working men and women favour a peaceful revolution and would certainly discountenance a violent one.   There is a large body of opinion in the rank and file against direct aotion, which Is regarded as a two-edged weapon that would recoil upon a future Labour Government.Mr. Clynes1 statesmanlike speech on Friday made a great Impression.The shortage of houses is still causing acute discontent and there is a feeling of exasperation among ex-soldiers.   The shorter evenings and the counter attractions of football are cutting flown the attendance at open air meetings.Indians in this country are conducting active propaganda for Home Rule.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has had a fresh access of funds from a private source.   It is, however, losing  750 a week and maybe/
&quot;be expected either to discontinue publication or to pass in other hands before long.A march of discharged, soldiers from Manchester to Ionu is in progress, but only twenty-eight men are participatingThere is a renewal of agitation against intervention i Russia,Signs of a rift between the leaders of the Labour movement are becoming marked.
!jgg POLIOSAlthough on September 11th the Trade Union Congress passed a resolution demanding Trade Union rights for policemen and reinstatement.of the strikers, I am informed by a reliable eye-witness that the delegates displayed marked indifference.   The response to the appeal of the Polioe Union for funds ia not encouraging, im spite ef the fact that the London District Counoil of the National Union of Railwaymen has recommended the Executive Committee to grant  500. The London Trades Council, whioh is swayed by Carmichael and has throughout supported the strikers, has started a fund which it heads with a donation of  50.The Committee in Liverpool is anxious about strike pay as it is wholly dependent upon headquarters.   It is making much capital out of a resolution before the National Union of Manufacturers; this resolution suggests the application of the Police Act to the Post Office, and to the mines and railways when nationalised.Sheffield, Nottingham and Dudley Police have seoeded from the Union.The question of reinstatement is agitating the Birmingham strikers; street collections are being made after pOlioe meetings.. In Birkenhead there is a movement in favour of reinstatement; 14,000 citizens are reported to have signed a petition in this sense. The. Watch Committee., however, deoided by 24 votes to 7 not to reinstate the strikers..The allegations made against the Police Union by ex-Inspector Syme have oailed forth bitter denials and denunciations.   I4r. carmichael attacks him in thisweek&apos;s/
-   -week&apos;s &quot;forward,&quot; in which appears also, under the heading, &quot;13 ex-Inspector Syne a police spy?&quot; a refutation of the charges by two Liverpool .exrpolicemen.At a meeting of the Birmingham Trades Council on September 7th, one of the speakers is said to have urged that the working classes ,should institute a Labour Secret Service, obtaining their personnel from the ex-policemen.   There is, however, no evidence that this suggestion was adopted. -THE RMOLUTIOHA1Y ASPJ30T -Off TH5 TR&amp;D.BS MlOH OPHtHESSS/.The Congress at Glasgow furnished useful indications of the strength of the revolutionary, element in Labour. It was evident that an ^overwhelming majority of the delegates was in favour of direct action,- but against this is to be put the notorious factor of the card system of voting.   The absurdity of the system was illustrated when it was found that the absence of a single delegate for &apos;a few minutes withdrew 90,000 votes. No doubt all the delegates were aware that the rank and file is &quot;by no means unanimous and that direct action is a double-edged Weapon which might be used against a Labour Government,&apos; as Mr. Clynes pointed out in his convincing speeoh on Friday.   Nevertheless, several delegates stated in conversation that the threat of direct action is not to be regarded as an empty one.The trend of the movement was further shown by the vociferous reception accorded to extremistsj whereas the &quot;attitude towards leaders such as Mr, gavelock Wilson and
&quot;*   &amp;   --Mr. Brownlie was remarkably hostile..An interesting statement was made by Mr. Henderson &quot;at a.private conference of members of the Parliamentary Committee to whioh.my. correspondent gained admission.   He , said that the miners had undoubtedly carried the conference with them and that, in his opinion, they were quite capable of bringing about a revolution unless they obtained the nationalisation of the mines.   Mr. Henderson, however, has always been rather prone to over-estimate the strength of the extremists, and it is Significant that both the miners1 representatives on the Parliamentary Committee were defeated,; and that the -.   .   majority of. this body is still opposed /to direct action.&quot;THE HOUSING question there is no visible abatement in the distress and unrest caused by lack of housing accommodation...... I heve referred previously to the deplorablehousing conditions in Glasgow.   The Corporation has approved the erection of 5000 houses, but according to the local. Medical Officer of Health there are.in the city at&apos;present .1,109 tenements, or 10,000 flats, inhabited&apos;,by about 47,000 people, which require demolition or substantial reconstruction.A.similar .state of affairs appears to exist at Newport, Mon,, where homeless ex-soldiers oaused an uproar at a meeting of the County Borough Council on September Sth, and stated that, there were 600:families -without aocpimodatton&apos;, whereas the Council proposed to provide for 60.Tha local councils in Leeds area are reported tobe/
be dissatisfied with the Government Housing Soheme.In Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool the beginning of building operations has caused much satisfaction.   When the list of applicants was opened at Manchester for the 1851 houses to be erected on Blaokley Estate, 1000 people registered on the first day, some arriving at the offices of the Housing Committee as early as 5 a*m..THE COST OF LIVINGThere are no signs that the unrest arising from high prices is subsiding and, should the Profiteering Act prove ineffective, passive discontent may give way to active measures.An important demonstration of London co-operators and Trade Unionists will take place in Hyde Park on Sunday next.   Preliminary notices presage strong opposition to the Profiteering Act.To the opposition against the proposed increase in the price of milk must be added a growing irritation at the present scale of fares.   The Cardiff Trade and Labour Council is urging an all-round reduction and this attitude is typical of other districts.In Liverpool great uneasiness has been caused by the statement that large quantities of bacon on the market are tainted, and public feeling is running strongly against the Ministry of Food.&apos; INTERVENTION IN RUSSIATho renewed agitation against Intervention in Russia, to which I referred last week, has developedconsiderably
considerably.A point on which particular stress has been laid is the alleged futility of the Government attempts to enforce economy while spending millions on Russia.Protest meetings have been held in many districts and my correspondents report that in Liverpool. Newcastle, Nottingham and Glasgow the outburst of resentment has been remarkable.   The fact that the Press generally has taken up tho question has given decided impetus to the campaign hitherto waged chiefly by Labour papers.   Great sympathy is manifested towards Colonel Sherwood-Ielly,THE NATIONALISATION Q3? THE COAL MIMESCampaigns for and against nationalisation are being vigorously conducted by the interested parties.   It is, however, unlikely that any mandate from the rank and file will be sought.at present.   If, however, the Government refuse to be &quot;compelled&quot; to adopt the Sankey report, it is not iraprolfcble that the special Trade Union Congress will order a ballot.   This view is based upon the fact, with which Labour leaders must be acquainted, that the workers1 opinion on the subject ?   of nationalisation is far from unanimous.Miners in oertain districts regard with disapproval a scheme which would involve the appointment of many paid officials, not of their own class,   further, the selfishness of the miners, which Mr. Srcdllie endeavoured to disprove, has become apparent to many other Trades Unionists.The point which strikes the general public mostforcibly/
forcibly is tho cost of the scheme, which is considered prohibitive. SCHISM IN THE LABOURAlthough many of %hQ decisions taken at the Trades Union Congress had the appearance of unanimity, the difference in opinion, both amongst the leaders and the rank and file of labour, is becoming more marked, and a definite cleavage seems inevitable.   The ( difference is not merely one of opinion regarding direot action, but strikes at the fundamental policy of the movement.An instance of the division in labour was afforded by the meeting of engineers in Glasgow on September 7th, when Mr, Brownlie, Chairman of the Executive Council of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, was forced to vacate the chair amidst shouts of &quot;Traitor&quot; and &quot;Renegade. These cries voiced the opinion of the extremists on Mir. BrownlieTs recent letter, although his.action was supported by a large section of his union.There is also a growing impatience vdth certain leaders, as was shown at the. Women1a Trades Union Meeting at Glasgow on September 9,th, when Mr, J.H. Thomas, M.P,, Mr. Henderson, M.P.., and Miss Mary Mac Arthur were literally howled down.The leaders and members of the British Socialist Party, the Socialist Labour Party and Workers1 Committees maintain an incessant onslaught on leaders such as Messrs. Clynes, Thomas, Henderson, Shaw, Walsh and Brownlie, who are denounced as &quot;traitors, the best bulwarks of the tottering edifice of capitalism,&quot; and are accused of selling the workers, who pay them to fight, for O.B.E.s., visits to the King and aeroplane flights.
DEMAND FOR TEE ABOLITION OF TH3 DEFENCE OP THE REALM APT, A movement to demand the abolition of the Defence of the Realm Regulations finds expression in the current issue of &quot;The Nation,&quot; which publishes an appeal to this end, with the following signatures:nephew of Mrs. Sydney Webb.   He was one of the founders of &quot;Common Sense&quot; with Sir H. Bell, and others of a like ilk.(2) gVWo, Hirst, formerly editor of &quot;The Economist&quot;, is editor &quot;oT^Common Sense&quot;, a periodical financed -,&apos; by, the Manchester School of Free Traders with the minor objeot of creating a Little England,The majority of these people are pacifists, and it is doubtful whether their underlying motive is really the belief that &quot;without freedom of speech, liberty of person, security of goods and the full protection of the Courts, British freedom is a mockery.&quot;NATIONAL CAMPAIGN POR INDIAlast week was was well received,Mrs. Besant, B.P; Wadia, P.H. Telang and Janunadas Dwarkadas, who have held a series of meeting in the large Northern towns, under the auspices of the local Labour Parties, are going to Wales this week.   In the North they seem to have been fairly successful, but they will probably make less impression in Wales, where the miners are not greatly interested in Indian matters.

The Union is now affiliated to the Clyde&apos; V-orkers&apos; Comitij Mr, A, Hannah, organising secretary, is devoting particular attention to propaganda in the East of ScotlaJThe march of ex-Service Men from Manchester to London, to which reference has been, made in previous reports, began on September 14th.   Only 28 men are reported to be participating; the route selected is via &apos;7inslow, Congleton, Stafford, Birmingham, Coventry, St. Albans, Barnet, Finchley.   It is expected that the march, if continued, will take about a fortnight.   They intend to march 15 miles each day and to hold a public meeting each evening.There has been complaint amongst disabled men that the new flat rate of pensions is detrimental to their interest. &apos; The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has done its best to . inculcate this opinion.. My correspondent reports that ex-Servioe men in Leeds distrust the various organizations, which they are loth to join.   On the other hand, they grumble.- about/
about their pensions and allowances*Ex-soldiers in Lancashire aro becoming restive and view the approaching winter with apprehension.   They are particularly bitter about the employment of female labour.The Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, with which is allied-the Society of a similar name in New Zealand, has- affiliated with the Comrades of the Great War.THE HERALD LEAGUEThe newly formed Acton and Chiswick  ranch of the League has met with a rebuff from the Chiswick Urban District Council, which gives permission for meetings only in exchange for a signed undertaking &quot;That no unpatriotic or seditious speech or remarks shall be made by the speakers for or on behalf of the League.&quot;As the propagation of sedition is the raison dMhre of the League, a procession and meeting to protest against the action of the Council was held at Ravenscourt Park on September 14th.   Both were sparsely attended. although the speakers included Hanson and Miss CNaill.A meeting on the same day at Finsbury Park was equally unsuccessful; Ponder made a disloyal and revolutionary speech, which evoked much heckling.the COMMUNIST CLUBIn order to divert attention from its activities, the Communist Club has been dissolved and will reappear as a &quot;Socialist and Labour Club for Central London.&quot;Premises have already been acquired at 28, East Road, City Road, 2,0.1.; these comprise two Halls, to seat 600 and 250 people respectively, and several smaller rooms.The Club will be registered under the industrial and/
and Provident Societies Act, and affiliated to the Club and Institute Union.   The sum of  500 is required to put the premises in order;  200 has already been subscribed and the remainder is to be raised by a 5$ loan.The Committee of the new Club consists of W.7.James, J.F. Knight, F, Cook, 7.B. Smith and A. Squair,WORKERS1 FREEDOM LEAGUEThis Society, which -has evolved from the recently defunct Victoria Park Patriotic Committee, is controlled by Morris Baruch, aoting secretary, and is in close touch with the Herald League.Speeches at Sunday meetings in Victoria Park are revolutionary.   On September 7th Baruch concluded with the following.exhortation:   &quot;Boys in khaki and blue, take off your;..uniforms and lay down your arms as a protest against the shooting down of your Russian comrades and the murder.of thousands of women and children.   If you have^to;use your rifles use them against those who order you to commit bloody murder.&quot;THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;   ,A week ago Mr. George Lansbury was seriously consideri the sale of the control of his paper.   It is confirmed that the paper is losing  750 a week, the outgoings being about  2,100 and the sales about  1,200 a week.   This week, however, his views have changed.   He states that he has received a private subsidy which makes him independent Of profits, and in any case he has resolved to maintain the policy of his paper until it is necessary to close down altogether.   The source of this subsidy has not yetbeen/
been discovered, but It is significant that Mr, Irancis Meynell, the sub-editor, has Just returned from Stockholm Mr, Lansbury went to Glasgow in the hopes of getting money from Trades Union sources, but is believed to have failed,   l*t is quite possible, therefore, that the paper may have to be sold or discontinued within a few months.I m assured by competent journalists that as a responsible Labour paper with a good Editor and a good Business Manager, and its present circulation of 300,000 to work upon, it might he oade to pay its way,   Mr, Lansbury, however, rather scornfully describes advertisements as &quot;growths of the capitalist system&quot; and professes not to desire them.   He has an unfortunate record of failure in his business enterprises,MB, AKTffilB HMEBSON OH LABOUR TOES3?       &apos;At a.meeting of the International Brotherhood*Congress on September 16th, Mr. Henderson reviewed tho causes of labour unrest throughout the World,   He said that the peoples, even those of high political development, had begun to lose faith in the Parliamentary system, and he doubted whether full political liberty would be realised in this and other countries without a ,      violent convulsion of society,Mr. Henderson is rather easily affected by opposition, and his mind may have been unconsciously affected by the, popular demonstration against him at the Women1s Trades Union Meeting at Glasgow on September - -  9th, -        -. 1 &apos; - - i? &apos; &apos;   $HMRY SARAThe Glasgow Anarchist Group, for which Guy Aldredhas recently been working,is now supported by Henry Sara,who is addressing tha usual meetings on Glasgow Green.The/sh)

The Crimes Act will also be in force in the following County areas, Tipperary, limerick, Dublin, Clare, Cork.The criticism and discontent reported last week to exist among a certain section of the Sinn Joiners, at what they describe as the inaction of the Headquarters ii ;.  Dublin, may be aooountable for the recent outbreaks of violence at Fermoy and Lorrha, Co. Tipperary, when a Police Sergeant in charge of a patrol was shot dead and one constable woundad, and can be looked upon as a challenge to the authority of Sinn Fein Headquarters, father Gleeson of Lorrha strongly denounced this latter i murder.The moderate Sinn Fein party are reported to be still relying for support of their policy on the influent j ., of the Church.; Affairs during the week in the Dublin Metropolitan Polioe area have been rather active.  A meeting was held on the 12th, when Arthur Griffith, at the request of the Dail Ministry, formally announced the opening of the National Loan of  250,000. : &apos;The Irish Volunteers are reported to be going to-V be/

Sinn Fein Clubs in County Sligo and County Roscommon are each stated to have subscribed  5,000,The situation in the Northern District is quiet. The Sinn Feiners are still working hard to keep up interest in their cause but are having practically no success.Arrangements have been made for a large Sinn Fein Conference to be held in Coatbridge, near Glasgow, on Thursday, 18th September, to consider the present serious position in Ireland.B.
