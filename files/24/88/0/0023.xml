^.3--&apos;--&apos;-&apos;&apos; cannjc waj^j./V,w^wrminifc.flXE^V^     MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,ft9 hi1,   The Cabinet decided oh 14th August that it was undesirable to commit the Government to the introduction in the autumn session of a Bill-dealing with Unempr-ov/r^nt Insurance, butcame to no other conclusion as to the future policy of theGovernment in this connection.   It is, however, not possible to defer much longer the definition of at&apos; 3&apos;east&apos;&apos;&apos; the broad linesof policy to be adopted because the whole position will befundamentally altered when the present tompoiery scheme ofdonation for civilian workers expires at the end of nextNovember,   Definite action will then have to be taken, and ifthe evils of. hasty improvisation a:;e to be avoided the broad      * .  .&quot;lines of policy ought to be settled now as the interval of twomonths is none too long for working them out in detail.2.   The^governing factor in the present situation is that the unemployment now existing.is provided for by the scheme of Out-of- . Work Donation to ex-service:&apos;men and civilian workers respectively. These schemes are temporary; that for civilian workers comes finally to an end on November 24th nextj that for ex-service men covers only one year after individual demobilisation, and will therefore come to an end for great numbers of men before the end of this year.3,   The possibility of allowing these schemes to expire without putting something in their place needs only to be examined to be dismissed. -There are at present over 500,000 persons drawing donation, of whom 350,000 are ex-service men.   This is the best time of the year for employment, and whatever progress may be made in the revival of trade during the course of the present year, the only reasonable assumption to make is that during the*      &quot; coming winter the numbers of the unemployed&apos;will be larger, and they may be much larger, than they are at present.   The only existing alternatives&apos; to Out-of-Work Donation are the unemployment   ) benefit of 7s a week, and Trade Union benefits, both of which cover only a small proportion of the working population, or Poor Law Relief.   In face of the precedent of the donation scheme, I think we must start from the assumption that to allow the donation scheme to expire and to put nothing&apos;in its place is impossible.  &apos; H4.   If this assumption-be admitted there are really only two &apos;-.*-, alternatives open.   One is to continue the payment of donation;- ,v &apos; in some form indefinitely.   The other is to take measures at once- &apos; with a view to substituting for it some scheme of State aided : contributory insurance against unemployment.   I assume that the first alternative cannot be seriously contemplated, and it is in order that it may be /possible to avoid it that I wish to press , for an immediate decision on certain broad points of policy,which will enable steps to be.,taken at once with a-view to the institution of a contributory scheme.
5.   Judging from the attitude assumed by the Trade Unions towards this question at the National Industrial Conference, I feel sure that they will not willingly acquiesce In a contributory scheme so long as they have any hopes of getting a non-contributory scheme.   On the other hand, once these hopes axe removed, I anticipate that I can secure a sufficient measure of agreement among the interests concerned to enable the:&apos;dovernr; to pass a Bill on a contributory basis.   I therefore ask,in the first plaoe for a decision of the  Cabinet in this sense.6.   Given this decision, and the Cabinet^ provisional approval1 of the measure as sketched below, j shall proceed to consult the Industrial organisations concerned in the hope of having a draft Bill ready by the end of the recess. Any delay at this st will mean the postponement of thejpill till next year, and a corresponding prolongation of the period during which provision for unemployment must be made by way of donation.7,   The broad lines of policy which I recommend for adoption are based upon the report of an inter-departmental Committee, w included a representative of the Treasury,   They are as follows(a)   There should be general provision for payments during unemployment, the funds being provided from contributions paid employers, employed and the State., (b)   Any well-organised Industry, which Is able and willing do so, will be allowed to set up a scheme for itself, subject to due approval, under which It will raise its own funds and administer them in accordance with Its special needs.(c) Voluntary associations in other industries (e.g, trato unions) may also be allowed under proper conditions to adminiate in accordance with special schemes the funds derived from their membership; these associations must be formed on an occupational basis and must not be carried on directly or Indirectly for profl(d) Apart&apos; from the industries referred to in (b) the-contr contributions of employers and employed will be -raised by means of sts affixed to contribution cards as in the case of the Health Insurance schemes this method may also be applied if desired to any industry under (b)t(e) The weekly rate of benefit to be paid to Insured workpeople other than those coming under special schemes (pam (b) and (c) ) will be IBa for men and 12s,6d for women; the rates under the special schemes must be on the whole at least as favourable to the workpeople,(f) In order to meet the case of individual workpeople irtu do not suffer from unemployment, such workpeople if they reach t age of 65 will be entitled to receive a refund of not less than amount of the contributions which they have paid together with interest (less any benefit received).
8.   Two other points of policy have to be decided and I submit for consideration alternative proposals with regard to each:-(1)   Should the scheme apply to the whole of the employed population (i.e, be practically coterminous with the Health Scheme), or should Agriculture and Domestic Service be excluded?The arguments on both sides are set out In the attached ex-tract (Appendix A) from the report of the Departmental Committee. My view is that on the whole the balance of advantage lies in launching the scheme on the basis that it is to be universal and allowing Agriculture and Domestic Service to make out a good case for exclusion, if they are able to do so.(2)   What should be the rate of the State contribution to the funds of the scheme?Broadly speaking the choice lies between making the State contribution one third or one fourth of the total revenue.   The arguments on each side are set out in the attached extract (Appendix B) from the report of the Departmental Committee. The estimated annual cost to the Exchequer, which varies according to whether Agriculture and Domestic Service are or are not included, is shown in the following table, which also gives the weekly contributions from employers and employed and from the State respectively, on which the estimates are based, together with corresponding figures for the existing scheme of unemployment insurance.-Weekly contribution from employers &amp;Employedjointly.State.Ration of State con-tribution to total revenue.(1) Agriculture and Domestic Service included.(ii)    dodo3d.

9, Scheme (t). til) and (1U) *re baaed on weekly contributions from employers and employed of Got for men and &amp; for womenj scheme (iv) requires 7d for men and 0d for women. If therefore my proposal that Agriculture and Domestic Servic should be included in the first instance is adopted, the contributions from employers, and employed to be originally proposed will be 6d* and fid.   If agriculture and Domestic Service are subsequently excluded it will not then pe prectioi to raise the contributions from employers and employed lh other industries to 7d and 6d, and the State contribution therefore if originally fixed at one-fourth would have to be raised to one*third.10. Having *egard to the precedent of the non-contributo) donation and the propaganda in favour of non-contributory provision for unemployment, I am not sanquine that a State contribution of less than one-third will be ultimately possible.   1 should be prepared, however, to begin negotiate with the industrial organisations on the basis of a State contribution of one-fourth (Agriculture and Domestic Service being included), on the understanding that if Agriculture and Domestic Service are excluded the State contribution will be raised to one*third; this would mean a comparatively small increase In the estimated actual amount of the annual State contribution, viz, from  3,980*000.to  4,200,000.Ireland.  The above proposals relate to Great Britftl With regard to Ireland I propose that the scheme ahould apply compulsorily only to the trades already covered by the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and that provision should be madi for its extension to other trades by administrative order.R.S.H0RNE.5th September 1919,
14, Argwntfoy an4 ajjainafr excluding Agriculture and DbWatlo stmdivThe arguments for excluding these groups Bey be stated ae : fellows:-.(1) They are exposed to a very lew risk of unemployment:Uyij*ut, Owing to special circumstances and look of organisation they are not In a position to take advantage of the provisions for segregation, and in so far as they remain in the Central fund they and their employers will have to pay a contribution greatly In excess of the stun drawn out in benefits, unless, and until they qualify for a refund at age 65* (see p&amp;ra^ph(ii) Their inclusion affects interests strongly represented in ParliaMutj and touch Parliamentary opposition^ may be expeoted if these groups are not exoluded.(ill) The problem of dealing with isolated workers like agricultural labourers and domestic servants present special difficulties.The arguments against exclusion aro;-(a) If any groups are exoluded however well Justified     / exolusion may be in itself there must obviously be a danger of pressure from other groups with a low risk of unemployment for exclusion, not merely in the sense of segregation butin the sense of complete exemption from the liability to make provision for unemployment * Miners and seamen and bank clerks might very well urge that the exemption extended to agricultural labourers and domestic servants ought also to be extended to them.  In this way general provision--eg&amp;JbQgt unemployment would break down from the outset,(b) The exclusion of agriculture and domestic service would make it neoessary to find and Interpret a workable definition of what is oovered by these terms, and this would be a task of great difficulty.(o) In view of the fact that these groups are now entitled to Out-*of&quot;ffork donation their exclusion from insurance may provoke opposition,(d) whilst the risk of unemployment In these groups is admittedly low, there is still some risk, and there is no guarantee that this risk may noFTe increased in future by uhforseen changes.  So far as the risk is less than normal full advantage can he taken of it by the formation of voluntary associations, while Individuals who experience exceptionally littla unemployment will obtain refunds on reaching the age of 66.(e) The exolusion of the three mill ion persons employed in these groups who are exposed to relatively low risk would reaot unfavourably on the financial basis of the scheme, In
view of the fact that the decision on this point turns mainly on political considerations, we have confined ourselves to submitting the alternative arguments and do not make any recommendations.

15. Rate of State Contribution. The rate of the State contribution to the existing Unemployment Insurance scheme one third of the contributions paid by employers and employed - that is to say, one fourth of the total revenue of the unemployment fund is contributed by the State (apart from interest on balance). Administrative expenses are met out of this fund, subject to a maximum of one tenth of the annual income.

It would not appear possible to reduce this rate of contribution and the question we have considered is whether it ought not to be increased. As regards earlier consideration of proposals for general insurance it may be mentioned that both the Civil War Workers Committee and the Labour Resettlement Committee assumed that equal contributions should be paid by employers, employed, and the State, i.e., that the State should pay one third of the whole income and not one fourth as at present.

The arguments ag&amp;inet increasing the Staid contribution-butlon abovo oneKfourtli of the total may be eta ted ad follow a:-(i) The alterations In the distribution of the national Income which have accompanied the- wqrVhaiye &apos;Xeft-this employing and qnployed olasses in intotry speaking generally, no worse&apos;off and in JTO^&apos;.oa%&apos;W&apos;the^eriail7 better off than before.  Compared witn ifcem thd remaining classes of Tax Payers! are relatively mnoji less prosperous than in 1911.  Without any alteration in the rates of the State contribution the wide extension of insurance   . and increase of bsnofite now proposed will themselves Impose a heavy additional charge u on the Tax Bayers * They may fairly demur to being asked in addition to pay for a larger share ff the beftefits to be enjoyed by relatively more  ortunate members of the community.(ii) Apart from considerations of equity the existing position of the National finanoes and the vast demands which are fa tag made fcpon the Tax Payer from all quarters makeit a matter of pressing necessity to avoid the placing upon the JSxohequer of additional burdens which the resources sf taxation may jaws unable to meet?   The cost of provision against unemployment should in the main be borne by the workers and the employers.  Logically there would be a strong case against any increase in the total State subsidy paid to the Unemployment Fund under the existing schem8*   The maintenance of the same proportion for the exchequer contributions as prescribed in 1911 will increase the estimate liability of the taxpayer from  1,000,000, a year to  3,200,000 a year, if agricultural labourers and domestic servants are omitted from the scheme, or if they are included, to  4,000,000 a year.  In accepting any such large increase the State may be regarded as having beeft fully as liberal as it can safely afford to be.(iii) in increase of the existing State proportion would be I likely to evoke a demand for a similar increase of the I Health Insurance contribution, The answer that large I supplementary sums have in fact fceen added to the grant of 1 two ninths of the cost of health benefits, chiefly by tfce if way of additional remuneration to doctors, may be met by I the contention that those grants did not in fact Increase I the Benefits provided for the insured person by Part I of the let of 1911:   they must be regarded rather as partof the cost of the Public Health Service. IH?In any ease it is probable that an alteration of the   1 status quo in favour of Unemployment Insurance would increaJI the difficulty of resisting demands in respeot of the        f health Scheme.
(iv) The grant of a rate of State contribution which y?J enable the benefit to be raided above 15/- a week for c*I and 12/6 a week for womon would oertainly produce a I demand for the corresponding Inoroaee in the rates of I sickness benefit under the Health Scheme, 1 person who I is unemployed through siokneos requires at least as muolii a persen who is well but tat of work, 1This would no doubt Involve an increase of the StaJ subsidy in that scheme, I(v) Further rates in excess of those abovejmentioned miJ prove so attractive as to encourage &quot;malingering&quot; and   I apart from the other evils thereby involved threaten the! solvency of the Scheme.In the administration of Health Insurance with ratJ of benefit at 10/ - a week for men and 7/6 a week for mm it has not $roved easy to guard against these dangers, 1 may be that for the future rates of 15/- and. l /6 will A be excessive, hut if any higher benefits are granted anil during the next five or ten years there should he an appreciable fall of prices and wages, It may well be doui in view particularly of the experience of 0ut-ef-Work   [ Donation, whether any administrative checks, however stringently devised, would provide adequate safeguards I against abuse,   The idea embodied in the proposals       I contained in the Report as regards voluntary assooiatioii is that benefits In excess of a moderate minimum should I be administered by self-governing and self-supporting   I bodies, and this prinoiple Is one which it is very       I important to maintain, IArguments against liniting the state contributionsw one-fourth of the &apos; tot&amp;T oo^ributlon,17, The arguments against maintaining the present rate ill the State contribution are:-fa)  Unless an attractive sohome with an adequate rate ol I benefit is put forward on a contributory basis with the 1 State bearing a considerable proportion of the cost, the demand for a non-oontributory soheme which is already m strong will become more urgent, and it is obviously desirable to conciliate this opposition if it can be dorj by a moderate increase in the State contribution, ((h)  $here is no certainty that it will be politically I possible to maintain the proposed rates of benefit of If 1 for men and 12/6 for wotneni, Itaking the allowances for dependents into account I the State haa provided under the Qut-of-Work Donation   I Scheme practically double this amount as a free $Aft aadj it will bo difficult to porsuade insured workpeople that I they ought to aocept a much sEsaller sum when they arc    I themselves contributing a substantial part of tho cost. 1(o) With regard to the grant for Health insurance undeijl part I of the national Insuranoe lot, 1911, it is true I that the expenses to foe defrayed out 0* monies provided I by Parliament wars originally limited to the oost of     I2* I
central administrations two ninths of the cost of administration incurred &quot;by approved societies and. two ninths, of the benefit,   In point of fact tho State share was never kept within this limit;   The Government found itself unable to provide the benefits promised, with the funds available in view inter alia of the demands of the medical profession, and from the outset large supplementary sums have been given to the Health Insurance Commissioners and approximately one-third of the benefits and of the 003t of providing thorn has been found by Parliament.   The medical benefit under the Health Insurance scheme has not been and is not now a part of a State medical service, but is one of the benefits for whioh insured persons are required to pay weekly contributions.(d) In view of the high levels which have now been , reached by wages and cost of living, and tho improbability Of any substantial reduction of either, it is difficult to suggest&quot;that benefit substantially higher than 15/- and 1.2/6 would, under the conditions of a contributory scheme, involve any real risk of abuse by malingerers.  -Similarly the argument based on the assumption that unemployment benefit must not exceed the rate of sickness benefit cannot lo sustained in view of the fact that the two benefits have always hitherto boon unequal.
