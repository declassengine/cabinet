(Copy cf letter from Admiralty).ADMIRALTY. 16th September, 1919.I em commanded by My  or&amp;a Commies loners, of the Admiralty to state for the information of the War Cabinet that they have I had under consideration War Cabinet Secret  aper G.I.8069 of I 29/8/19 on the subject of Imperial Sea Communications.2.   The subject is one which concerns the Admiralty very I closely.3.   In making% preparations in time of peace for the protection I of our trade on the sea in war, it is very necessary that the 1 Admiralty should be in close touoh with all developments I relating thereto.   Wot only is it necessary for $heir Ijor&amp;ships [I to be made aware of developments as they occur, but they should I know the line impending developments are likely to take.   These I developments may very materially affect Admiralty plans, and itis obvious that the policy as regards protection of trade may I need modification oi amendment in order to conform with them. I Thus for instance, proposals as to the establishment of docks, I fuelling stations, etc., are of the greatest importance to the Admiralty.   I am accordingly to suggest that the Director of /Trade division of the $aval Staf/ should be added 1 to the proposed committee to represent the Admiralty.4.   The Admiralty would not of course wish to interfere 1 in any way with any of these schemes which, naturally, will 1 be developed on commercial lines, but it is essential that I they should be aware at the earliest possible moment of the I trend of the improvements which the Committee propose.5.   It may be added that a large quantity of information I bearing on these questions is available in the Admiralty,   -I and the presence of an Admiralty representative would enable I the Committee to obtain aooesB to suoh of this Information I as they require with the least delay.I ,8ffi, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)    W^SICHOLSON. !!&amp; Secretary,* WAR CABIUEN
