IRELANDiuarod is compliance with Oh; tinute If 17th March, 1917,vJesk ended 17th September, 1919.Memorandum preparod ij compliance with Chief SeAa^etarySThe following is a brief statement en the work of the epartment during the  ast week in furtherance of increased Fe*dL reduction in Ireland!-&apos;. -  &apos; &quot; ;j; PANS FOR AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY.The number of applications for loans for the purchase of mohinery received during      past weok was IS, a$ the tortaVraluo of machinery ordered to date is  55y9$4.TXLLACS SECTION.Satisfactory progress.continues to be made with the work of, the checking of the declarations of growers of cereals in connection, rith tho Government^ guaranteed prices.   At the same time, the   -f ork of making the general irop survey is also progressing satisfactorily,PROGRESS OF FARM WORK.Although rain fell at times during the week, the weather icnditi:ns on the whole were ideal for harvesting operations. In the earlier parts of the country the stacking of the oats orqp has been finished and threshing become general.   Tte quality of the rain and straw is said to,be very good, but tho yifcld will, it is eared, prcve below normal,   On light soils, especially, the ears did not fill well.   In some dlBtrtets the yields of barley are favourably reported on.Pastures are- still improving,but tho weather has not Tie on sufficiently warm to oause rapid growth, and complaints are being received from many districts that cows are continuing to,go off milk.Late varieties of potatoes are stated to be still making good (growth in oomo ita&amp;KitiiH counties.Turnips are continuing to progress well and may be a full in somo aroas.   The early sown crops have hot reoovered&apos; so jwoll  from the effects of the drought as those sown later.
The- backward condition of the root eropo, coupled with the high prioee of hay and feeding stuffa generally, has led to a raueh greater area being put under catch orope than usual,FLAX.The weather during the week was favourable for the harvest-I ing of flax, and the bulk of the drop has now been retted and stacked, I A considerable quantity *f flax has been brought to the mills I preparatory^ to being southed.   It is likely j however, that theecutohing soascn will not begin generally gefc. Some time..   Owing 1 to the continued dry weather in July and August, a large number tf I mills were impeded In the ecktohit^ of flax and tew of tho 1918 I crop owing to the want     water to provide power.   Th? scutching; eftow from the 1910 crop has not yot been completed.   When this has&apos;beam I done a number of mills will require to stop for repairo before I beginning their 1919-20 Season.Representatives of scutch-millowners met ax representatives.I of the scutchers on tho 10th instant to discuss the demands of theI latter for increased rates of pay.   Some progress was made t^wardo an understanding on tho subject of time ratej but the piece rate demandB of tho scutohers were considered altogether excessive and a common aereemont wao not arrived at on this point.   It is hop^A.- j jpwever, that It may still be possible for scukah-milloimars and ifteltvI] employoos to mako arrangements by mutual consent.In many districts flaxgrowers ooraplain that mlllowreors &quot;1 still adhere to the practice of regaining the farmers&apos; tow in paymentor part payment for scutching, in spite of the regulations made in I connexion with the licensing of soutoh mills prohibiting this j practioo.   The Department have prepared a leaflet explaining the 1-1 position in the matter, and urging millownero in the interests of y the flax growing industry to comply with the regulations.   It is &apos; tl hoped that this loaf let will be distributed at an early date.I FOOD    CONTROL    SECTION.The Fotd Ctatrel Committee for Ireland having been I dissolved some time agv* and pertain powers and duties which ! had been exeroisod &quot;by the Committee, ard which It was found I necessary   ta continue, having been transferred by the Gaveriament S to this Department, it is intended In future to Include in this   &apos; I weekly Statement, a shert summary of the work dono under the head-; ing of Food Control.fThe following is a summary of the work of the past week:-
Milk Prices* It has been ;&apos;ound necessary to re-fixHajciraum Retail&apos; prices for Milk in many districts in the North of Ireland.   x&apos;hese prices show an increase on previous maximum prices, and are due to a&quot; general increase in the cost of production, e.g. Sages, Feeding Stuffs, etc.   The Retail prices had to be increased in order to ensure supplies to the districts.Broad.    Licences have been issued in many districts in Ireland increasing the price of Broad over the counter for cash ;rom 9d. to 9-Jd. per 4 lb, loaf.
