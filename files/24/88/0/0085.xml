Ten acres of land at Great Barford which tho Bedford County Council have for seme years    occupied under the Small Holdings Act was put up for sale by auction by the owner.   The County Council askod permission of the Board to bid at the    1 auction in. order that the small holders might retain possession. AS the Councilfs lease does not expire until 192-5 the Board thought it.probable that the property would not prove attractive to an ordinary purchaser, and they, therefore, decided to sanction -the County Council bidding only ip to  5CO although they asked permission to gc up to  650*   Tho Council failed to purchase the property it being secured for  525 by one of the small holders himself* * The result is that the County Oounoilwill find itself from now until-.1525 in the anomalous position cf being a tenant of ont of their own statutory email holders.Lincoln (Holland Division]-.   The Board have had serious difficulty with the Smsn^oIcliHgs&quot;Committee in this county vrith regard to the purchase of land for small holdings.   Proposals for the
purchase of four properties were submitted by the Council to the Board during the first six months of the present year. In each case the Board found thsmsolves unable to sanction the Council acquiring the properties at tho prices recommended by the Committee and urged that the Council should make use of its compulsory powers in, order to acquire those properties at a reasonable price.   The Council objected to theEbtitude of the Board, and sent a deputation which was received by the Parliamentary Secretary on the 1st August, to urge that they should be given a free hand to purchase land at whatever price the 3mall Holdings Committee thought fit to offer. On the 6th August tbs Board wrote to the Clerk of the County Council conveying the decision of the Board with regard to tho reprosent.ati.on of thy Deputation.   They pointed out that they felt specially bound to scrutinies closely the prices proposed by the   Ccuioil in view of the fact that some of the vendors wero thsiroelvtfs members of that body, and while adhering to tho reduced price whileh the Board had already sanctioned in the case of two farms of which tho owners wero members of the Committee, agreed that in tho other oases they would bo prepared to abide by the decision of an independent valuers   Che Board also took steps to see that their letter to the County Council was given publicity in the local and v general press.The Board have received this week information showing that the owners of three of the four properties have decided to accept the Board1s price. The fourth property has been sold by the owner privately,, It is hoped that the result which has followed from the Board&apos;s action in this case will prove useful in restricting the excessive prices claimed by land owners for properties offered for small holdings,London.   The Board have for some time had considerable anxiety wiTh regard to the position of London applicants for small holdings&quot;.   The dtaty of satisfying such applicants rests with the London County Council, who, notwithstanding representations which have &quot;peen mado to-tan by the Board, have not only failed to acquire any land for the purpose, but havo taken no stops to interview any cf the men who have applied    - to them for small holdings,   She Council have merely entered into negotiations with the Councils of neighbourin  counties with a view to the transfer to these Councils of the applications of any men who desire to settle in their areas.   the 3oard have now written to the London County Council s&amp;ying that they are not able to avoid the conclusion that the Council have been&apos; principally anxious to evade their responsibility and to transfer it to neighbouring counties in spite of the fact that other Councils will naturally -;ive preference to Tneir own residents. Che Board have further pointed out that if the dounoll are not prepared to take action on their own behalf, the Board themselves will have to undertake the task of dealing with London applicants, although it would be a matter of much regret if so important a local authority as the London County Counoil failed to take its share in carrying out the Land Settlement policy of the Government.
farm SottleqentB administered by the Board,     The total area of land administered by the Board remains unchanged, namely, 15,643 acres.Hine additional ex-;service  men hrve commenced work, bringing the total number of such men up to 248, namely, 69 settlers, 145- probationers, and 44 men working as wage-earners.    In addition 21 men have been accepted as settlers., but have not yet started work.The reports received from the Directors show that great improvement in the weather during the second half of the week has ! enabled them to push on harvest operations.    At iatrin^tonpractically all the oorn is cut, with the exception of 188 acres I of Spring corn.    There is plenty of grass Uceep&apos;.- and-roots are 1 doing well.     At pem^r^y about 50 acres of oats wore harvested. 1 The crop is not heavy, but the corn promises to be a good sample, ! The grass is growing fast after the recent rains and there is now I an abundance of &quot;keep1.      At Helbeach the settlers have been &apos; employed in harvesting and lifting potatoes.     Carting potatoes hasbeen somewhat delayed owing to the scarcity of railway trucks. I Tho settlers are taking over one of tho barns at &quot;Bertie Lodge&quot; and part of an iron shed adjoining as a store for co-operative  oods. I At Amesbury the main crop of potatoes is t ripening off and roots 1 show an improvement.    Manual labour consisted mainly of potato-1 picking.     33 acres of Winter oata threshed 350 oaoka weighing 156 1 lbs.    At ?lo lies ton the approximate acreage of grain gathered^ wheat I 140, beans 20 and winter or:ts 36.     At Bos bury the harvesting is . completed, but the crop is not up to earlier expectations, straw being docidodly light.    Hop-picking commenced on the 4th September, 1 but work was delayed owing to a strike of pickers who left on the I 9th instant and &quot;rajor *.lrush hrd to make ether arrangements,-I:., UO&quot;   XjAITD DRAINAGE,m% Ouse Improvement at Downham.I The work which was undertaken in Kay, in preparation1 for the commencement of dredging operations above Denver Sluice, I was stepped on September 12th on account of a dispute with the I labourers.    The officer in oharge of the work gave orders ae to I the system on which the moving of soil in barrows &quot;from the front to I the back of the bank was to be carried out,    The men refused to Jwork on that system, and demanded the adoption tf a different system lifhich involved at least one man at eaoh working place standing idle Jfor a great part of the day.    The men were informed that their .1 demand could not be granted, and they thereupon ceased work, IApproximately 1,000 yards of bank has b.ien repaired and shaped, and I this will enable dredging to be carried on for at least three laiwnths without any further preparatory work.    It is not proposed Jat present to attempt to obtain mere labour, except for minor work which has to be completed, and the camp which had boon established ie jolo3od down,     A considerable part of the plant and equipment will jbe transferred to&quot;work on the Trent Banks at Keadby, which it is ^proposed to commence at.once,    Dredging will commence about jOotobor 1st on the reach that has been prepared.     The hand labour liftiich has   ow ceased was costing approximately -f250 por week,-1 tiii) Titho, Commons, Copyhold and Survey.,1 28 applications for the redemption of tithe rentohargejWc been received durine the week, including 4 for compulsory lred3mption.    The total amount of tithe rentcharf. e involved ie i^*3.17s.6d.    One application was in respect of the whole tithe Ibht charge of the parish of Adwell, Oxford, amounting in all to  126.
AApplications for enfranchisement of copyholds also continue to be considerably above the average, 12 having been received during the past week.     The fact that considerable interest i3 being dis-played in questions relatinc to the enfranchisement cf copyholds is also evidenced by the largo number of enquiries (about 420) received sinoe the beginning of the year regarding the revised Scale of Compensation issued by the Board in January last,A case has arisen where the titheowner, after applying for tho compulsory redemption of certain rentcharges payable to him. has neglected to furnish.the statutory declaration as to his title required by Section 8 of the iccent Tithe Act.     As he has completely disregarded, numerous enquiries from the 3oard, and as. in the mean-time, one of the landowners concerned has paid the whole redemption money in respect of one rentchsrgej the Bonrd are taking steps to pay this money into Court under sub-section 2 of the above section.An enc^uir, has been received from the Central Landowners&apos; Association regarding the possibility of apportioning under tho Tithe Acts the redemption annuities created under Section 4 of the recent Act, and also as to whether the balance of an annuity can at any time be discharged.by the payment of a lump sum.     There appears to be no power under the Tithe Acts, or in other Acts administered by this Department, for the redemption of these annuities, and from verbal enquiries made by callers in this Branch there is reason to believe that the absence of such a provision acts as a bar to the more general adoption oi&apos; annuity provisions by landowners, who hesitate to charge their landu? with  a lengthy annuity y/hich they may not be able to get rid of as they can at any time of the existing rentcharge.Under the Mansfield and District Light Railway (3xtcnsions) Draft Order, 1919. it is proposed to give powers to the Railway Company to use certain, roadside wastes for the purpose of road widening.    Letters oi enquiry have been sent to the Town Clerk of the borough of Kansfield and to certain District Councils in the neighbourhoods in which the roadside wastes are situate, and alao to the Commons and footpaths Preservation Society with a view to ascertaining whether there exist any rights cf common over the wastes in question.     The l3oard are also in communication with tho Light Railway Commissioners and with the Board of Trade (Railway Department) on the subject, as an amendment of the proposed Order may be necessary.Commercial Division.ding Branch.Appointment,,of ,Archflpote.

The experiments with regard to the conversion of Cordite into fertiliser have now &quot;boon carried a stage further and&apos; a system has boon devised by which a material is produced from the Cordite containing about 5% of nitrogen,     The coot, however, of conversion is estimated to amount to about  7 per ton, while in addition it would &quot;be necessary to erect a factory at a oost of .-r20,000 - f30,000 in order to trept the material,     The total quantity of Cordite available for disposal is 20,000 tons, so that the net cost of&apos;production would be from  8 to  8.10.0 per ton. The sale value&quot;of the material is only  4,3.0,0 and consequently the Government would be involved in t, loss of about  .30,000,    In these circumstances the Controller of Condemned Munitions Recovery does not advise that th   experiments should be proceeded With,     It is proposed, therefore to destroy the Cordite by burning it.The process by which Nitrate of Ammonia is extracted from Amatol and other explosive materials is proceeding satisfactorily, two factories being in operation and another one about to be started.     These will produce about 150 tons per week,     The estimated cost of r/rodueing the ammonium nitrate is&quot; 6. per ton and as the selling price at present is over  2&apos;0 there is a considerable profit on the process,Potash,   The arrangements which have been m-de for the sale of potash &quot;acquired by the Government from Germany,appear to
oe proceeding satisfactorily.      The British Potash Company, who are acting as thy Belling Agents, have made arrangements whereby the Fertiliser Manufacturer&apos; Association will take from them 24,000 tons out of the total of 40,000 tons for use either in the manufacture of compound manures or for sale to farmers on the authorised terms.    Tho material is, he ever, coming forward very slowly, hut it is hoped that deliveries will he mere rapid ,next month.Testing of Seeds Order,    Quantities cf seed wheat cf the new crop* are now being sold at&apos; Corn markets and elsewhere and steps arc being&apos; taken to draw sellers4 attention to the need for making a iederation as to tho germination etc. of the seed they sell.    Most jeed merchants are aware of this requirement, but it is a difficult natter to ensure that a declaration is given in the case of sales between farmer and farmer.In order not to handicap quick sale and delivery during the Autumn a General licence has been issued authorising a delay if one month in the delivery of the Declaration.fficoort of Cereal Seed. Applications are still being received for % shnre of the 2,&apos;500&apos; tons of seed whe^t wd 1,000 tons of winter hts which it has been decided may bo licenced for export up to the md of this year. Several Belgian merchants each claiming to have lad an extensive pre-war trade in English socd grain have called at the Board1s offices during the past few days to urge their claims for consideration in connection with the allocation of the quantity to be shipped to that country.Technical Division.foments and Disposal Section.During the week ended 13th September returns of sales fere forwarded by Cheshire, Hants, Monmouth, Sast Sussex, Lanes, Jest Riding (Yorks), Carmarthen, Oxfordshire and Norfolk.The returns show that the following have been disposed of2738 Tractors3659 Tractor Ploughs2622 Miscellaneous Tractor Implements3178 Binders- 184 Mowers and Reapers49-34 Hcrso Ploughs1274 Drillc ! 1906 Carts and LorriesI 4172.

The latter; have therefore been oommtnioated with semi-officially to ascertain how far accommodation is likely to be available.    The students have for the most part alroady resided in England, and after their training in agriculture most of them would become farmers in Serbia, while a ssmall proportion might undergo further training to qualify as Agricultural Advisers in their own country.County Mrioultural Education,    An inspection was made by HF, Bruce of Canning ton Court, *naar Bridgwater, and a farm of 174 acres nearly adjoining, which the Somerset County Council have applied for authority to acquire for the purposes ofa farm Institute.    The rent proposed to be paid for the farm is very reasonable, and the Court (a Tudor building) although requiring considerable internal alterations to fit it for educational purposes, could be adapted at much less expense than would be necessary for the purchase cf a new building, The orignal proposal of the Authority was to rent the property on a 35 years&apos; lease.;    It was pointed out, however, that this was too short a time, and in an interview with the Agricultural Committee, held after the inspection, it has been agreed that if the property could be rented on a 99 years&apos; lease, and subject to certain specified conditions the Board would be. prepared to approve,Igg -Pjstribution Schome.    A report has been submitted on the work 0f this scheme since 1916,    The scheme was started as a war measure with the ohjoct of increasing production by effecting a more rapid improvement in the poultry stock in England and Wales, and arrangements were made for the distribution of stock at a lew rate to smallholders and cottagers through (a) Egg Stations, distributing sittings between January and May, (b) Day-old Chick Stations, distributing chicks between February and June, (c)flncubating Stations, distributing chicks, surplus eggs for sitting, and adult stock birds.    The Egg and Chick Stations are selected annually for seasonal work;   Incubating Stations are more permanently established for work throughout the year.     In 1919 thcrs have been 156 Stations, 3  hick Stations, and 4 Incubating Stations, the latter being, established; in Anglesey , Cornwall, Cheshire and.Denbigh, Approximately 53,000 eggs and 3,000 chicks have been distributed at the reduced rates, the premium to station-holders having been 1/8 per dozen for eggs, and 3/4 for chicks.     The value of the Stations are , now recognised by all classes of poult ry-Icoepors, and as&apos;the success Mid utility of the scheme are assured it is proposed that it should be taken over ty the local Authorities as a part of their ordinary educational activities, in respect of whioh a 2/3rds grant is payable by the Board,l?y Branch.Encouragement cf Chcesomaking Scheme.

Although so many men have now returned there is no increase of unemployment among the women as comparod with the two previous years, although the unemployment during that time was at a rather earlier time in the summer.     This season the main reasons for such unemployment as exists would seem to be as follows: (a) the lightness of the harvest;   (b) the reduction in some districts of dairy herds;   (c) the partial failure of the root crop in certain areas.      The women now unemployed are likely to be absorbed for work in the potato harvest, several demands having oome in for gangs,land Settlement,   papers and reports of the women considered suitable for &quot;land&quot;settle ment have been received from many of the Women1 s County Oo&amp;nUtees.

The number of cases is also in-creasing in the home counties, although they are still sporadic and scattered.    The worst case is one which has been discovered at Hayes, Kent, where a group of allotments is- badly attacked, and it is evident that infection has been there for some time.
