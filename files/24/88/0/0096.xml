JltllLgooument is the Prenart^ /,-.&apos;/-&quot; Hi    JJ^jFrom Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 20/A September 1919. (f^&apos;7/; p   , \; (Received 21st.)&apos; Clear the line.1360 S. Secret. Afghanistan. We have received four letters from.Kabul dated 10th September.First, from Amir to me, acknowledging my message to him on signature of peace transmitted through Afghan delegates expressing his own satisfaction at conclusion of peace and hoping that friendly relations will be strengthened, asking me to forward, letters to King-Emperor, and assuring me I shall always find him ready for estah-lishment of friendship and discussion of friendly matters. He says, however, that if Afghanistan had succeeded in acquiring confirmation of its complete independence as result of first letter, hostilities would never have taken place.Second, from Mahmud Tarzi to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, requesting that Amir&apos;s letter may be transmitted to King-Emperor, thanking God for happy termination of recent unpleasantness which he says might have been avoided by earlier sympathetic attitude towards Afghanistan&apos;s desires for,independence, rejoicing that channels ufor direct and independent correspondence with Secretary of State opened and assuring them Afghanistan will be, friendly and very useful to British Government in Asia.Third, from Amir to King-Emperor, is on illuminated paper and enclosed in solid leather covering blocked in gold. Complimentary commencement in Amir&apos;s own handwriting, running: &quot; To His Majesty the abode of magnificence and grandeur, my dear friend, the Most Magnificent King George, King of Great Government of England and Emperor of India.&quot;Letter refers to privilege of addressing His Majesty and Amir&apos;s great fortune in being able to express sentiments of friendship. Amir expresses thankfulness at our acknowledging independence of Afghanistan which has made with her Afghan nation joyful and has increased implicit trust and affectionate friendly relations with Britain. Letter concludes with expression of high esteem, due respect, to great and kind friend His Majesty the lung.   It is signed simply Amir Amanulla,Fourth, from Amir to Grant, acknowledging Grant&apos;s kindness to Afghan delegates expressing regret for past occurrences which ought never to have happened, trusting that friendly relations will improve and increase, accepting treaty and agreement which he says&quot; is forerunner of another treaty which will be concluded for the purpose of establishing and perpetuating friendship between the two Governments and expressing thankfulness to delegates of both Governments for tact and judgment which led to removal of hostilities and re-establishment of amity and affection.All letters are very friendly in tone, but make it clear that Afghan cue now is to represent that they waged war to gain complete independence and have succeeded in the object. Full translation follows by mail. I reserve my comments on serious departure from precedent involved by Mahmud Tarzi addressing Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs direct. Letter dated 14th September also received by Grant from - Ali Ahmad stating Amir will arrange as soon as possible for British Envoy&apos;s departure so that he may start for India this week.
