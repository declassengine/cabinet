Evacuation of Foreign Subjects from Riga.

At request of Foreign Office, "PRINCESS MARGARET" is being held in readiness to evacuate between 200 and 300 foreign subjects from Riga in the event of a Bolshevik invasion threatening. This arrangement will only hold good so long as the Gulf of Riga is ice free.

NORTH  BURST A,Bolsheviks are operating on the River Northern Bwina, but are meeting with little success.   Good progress has been made by Russian troops on the Railway front, their success being largely attributed to our new gas in aeroplane bombs.    Bolsheviks are apparently evacuating the whole of the Onega valley, and Russian patrols having&quot;approached the town both from the North and West, it was occupied on 10th September.Evacuation of Archangel is proceeding smoothly, but the enemy is closely following our withdrawal down river * The withdrawal of British troops from the most southerly section now held on the Murman Railway will commence on 18th September.Cn 8th September a force consisting chiefly of British Marines and 2 guns attacked the enemy at Ustsuna and Koikori on Lake Onega.   The operation was no&apos;t successful.SSSWS1*The advance Naval and Military. Commission have now proceeded to Germany in connection with the reduction of naval and military forces.The State War Ministries of Prussia. Bavaria, Saxony and Wurtemburg have been abolished and their duties taken over by Reichsminister Noske.ITALY ....manned by a crew paid at mine clearance rates.   This crew has now been relieved by a General Service Naval crew.It is under consideration to withdraw &quot;SUMIILL II&quot;.S.S. &quot;Kursk&quot;!        . SSo So &quot;KURSK&quot; with Finnish Legion sailed from Leith on Oth for Copenhagen and Baltic.   Legion will be disembarked on island of Nangeh off Roval.S.N.0o, Baltic, has been requested to do all in his power, in conjunction with British Commissioner, to assist disembarkation and to ensure &quot;KURSK&quot; being turned round within 3 days,,Esthonian, Latvian and Lithuanian representatives have arrived in Finland for a conference on tho question of peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks,    Negotiations between Lithuanians and Bolsheviks are reported to have been opened, but this report is unconfirmed-     Latvia has been offered the same terms as Esthonia.Bstlionian delegates are to meet the Bolshevik delegates at Pskov about&apos; September 15th to discuss peace terms. In the event of peace being concluded HoLJ. Ships will be obliged to leave Reval.The British Military Mission is now of opinion that the capture of Petrograd by an advance along the southern shore of the Gulf of &quot;Finland is now impracticable.    They still however incline to the possibility of Finnish intervention with this object^ in view.   The state of the Russian North West Army is now &quot;much reduced in numbers, but the morale of those remaining with the colours is said to&quot; be good.
Following are extracts from Admiral Troubridge?s report on the situation on the Danube :-MI was now organising the two objects I have above referred to, viz: the disarmament and control of warships, and the provision of food for the people.    For this latter purpose 1 was manning and coaling three tugs to send down the River to bring up food.&apos;   II.M. Ships &quot;APHIS&quot; and &quot;LADYBIHD&quot;, together with some M.L&apos;S and Flotilla auxiliaries were lying at Baja, 100miles....To calm public opinion, which is considerably exercised over the question of demobilisation, the Assistant Secretary of State for the Navy recently granted an interview to a press representative.    Pointing out that demobilisation was a more difficult process in the iiavy than in the Army, owing to the difficulty of replacing skilled ratings whose work &quot;had been the care of the enginec and machinery, on war-vessels put out of commission, he said that, nevertheless, by October, all reservist ratings up to tho 1C96 class would have been released.    The demobilisation of the officers pro-ceods more slowly owing to the numbers engaged in bine sweeping and other exceptional work - or lent to other Ministries. One economy is to be made by reducing the number of Flag Officers    all promotion to&apos; the rank of Vice Admiral has been suspended, whilst promotions to other ranks are being reduced. Numerous offices ashore have been done away with, and also many aviation camps and aerodromes.    The Dockyards are to take up merchant ship construction.    That at Venice has already been partly sold to a private firm.The&apos; arjitationof the&apos; 2,000 workmen discharged from Castellamare Dockyard has proved so strong that it has led to the Ministry of t-arine consenting to re-instate them, and they are now to be employed on completing the &quot;Caracciolo&quot;, the&apos; only one of the class of four 30,000 ton super-dreadnoughts which has not been broken up.     It is stated that she will be launched about March, 1920.    Durin^ the war there was a project to complete her as a merchant ship, but this fell through.Vice Admiral Lorenzo Cusani Visconti relieves Soar Admiral Ugo Rombo as president of the Adriatic Inter-Allied Naval Committee.FJLvme.    The Italian Battleship &quot;1MANUELI PILIB1JRT0 left Fiume on 12th September.   She had been stationed there since November last.&quot;DAM ALIGHIERI&quot; is also under orders to leave. It is reported that demonstration took place on 11th and 12th September alongside the Italian battleship to protest against their departure.D&apos;Annunzio arrived at Fiume on September 13th and took charge of the Town, which was handed over to him by tho Italian General Pettaluga, who declared himself helpless;By D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s order the Allied Flags at the Palace were lowered with musical honours, and he has guaranteed that the Allies shall not bo molested; -Arrangements have been made to concentrate the British troops near H.I.&apos;. Ships should the necessity for doing so arrive.The Italian Government have disowned D&apos;Annunzio?s action, and announce that steps will immediately be taken to repress it.
The Turkish s.s. &quot;GUL DJEMAL&quot; has arrived at Constantinople from Hamburg with 7uQ Russian prisoners of war for repatriation.The landing.of prisoners of war at Black Sea Torts is suspended pending a decision by General Denikin as to where they may land&apos;.Meanwhile the holding of ships and passengers at Constantinople is causing great difficulties.The approaches&quot;to the Dardanelles and the whole coast of Crete are reported clear of mines&apos;.The ilinosweeping at Dedeagatch is very noarly com-leted, and the British were, about to commence on Varna and ater on the Burghaz Minefields, but it is now considered that the -Bulgarians should bo requested to clear tho Varna and Burghaz Minefield..The Port Convoy Office PIRAEUS is to close on September 15th.3LftQK SSa Ml QftfJFIAN.E.A. reported that evacuation of Caspian was com-pie ted by 6th September.

COfS-UiSTON. week ending 13th September, 1919.Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control..The &quot;Advance Party&quot; referred to last week left Parisfor ...&apos; 4.1miles South of Budapest&apos;.I had instructed Conmander George Loith, C.B.E., Commanding the Flotilla to raise the mines that had been laid by the Bolshevik Government, and had sent Officers dovm the River to purchase food upon my credit as a British Officer from the peasants in the adjoining&quot; districts.&quot; Though they had been robbed by the Bolshevik Govern-ment, and later by the victorious army, my Officers were successful in purchasing 500 tons of corn, and about the same quantity of other foodstuffs, which I desired to bring by wrter to Budapest.The&apos;Flotillas, including the &quot;111HIS&quot; and &quot;LADYBIRD11 were able to pass up to the anchorage of Buna Fentele, 40 miles below Budapest, on the 14th instant, the operation of minesweeping on the liiver having been satisfactorily performed.As regards the future uso of the Monitors, I am invited by the various authorities to bring them to Budapest for various reasons.    My intention is to keep them below the City, and not to bring them up the Kiver, unless by their presence they can give moral or material support to any Hungarian Government, in order to prevent a return to&quot; disorder ^nd Bolshevism.
