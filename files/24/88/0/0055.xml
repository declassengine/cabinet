(THIS HOP IBM IP IS THE PRCPEftTY 09 HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).WAR    CABINET.&quot; UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. Memorandum by the&apos; Chancellor of 4he Exchequer.As regards paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Memorandum (G.T.8123) by the Minister of Labour, it will bo seen that Sir Robert Home proposes to start off with proposals for a scheme including Agriculture and Domestic Service in the expectation however that he may bo,beaten, in whidh event he will withdraw those industries from the scheme.   This is1 a natural course to pursue but unfortunately it would have serious financial results.    With agriculture and domestic : service included     the scheme is solvent with the State contribution limited to one-quarter and the con-tributions by employers and employed together 6d (men) or 5d (women).      But if you cut out agriculture and domestic service in which unemployment is low you must, to keep the soheme solvent, either put Uf the employers an- employed peoples tontribution by Id all round (which is impracticable if the lower rates had already been announced)  r inorease the State contribution to one-third.Accordingly I strongly urge that the soheme as first announced should be (No.(iv) - viz. employers&apos; and employed persons&apos; contributions 7d. (men) and 6d (women) and the State contribution one quarter.   In tho (extremely improbable) event of an agitation arising for the inclusion of agriculture and domestic service the scheme could be easily modified later by including them and it would, not be necessary to raise the State contribution from one quarter.It seems certain that agriculture and domestic service will be dutaido the scheme before it becomes law and it would be fatal to produce a scheme which would be unsound without their contributions.(Initialled)   A.C.SEC RET., G.T.-8155.TREASURY.
