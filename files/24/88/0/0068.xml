1/2171330 S. Secret. Following is from Consul-General, Kashgar. dated 20th August, received Oth September.: &quot; Afghans announce intention to appoint (Consul at) Kasligar. This would seem furthering Afghan-Kashgar (troublesome) schemes, possible subversion of British protected subjects and a menace to us generally. As no treaty between China and Afghanistan exists, Chinese would probably not recognise such appointment. Kashgar Taoyin without actually mentioning &quot;Afghanistan has issued orders prohibiting foreigners from crossing the frontier pending his instructions,&quot; I will report any developments with a view to action being taken in Peking if necessary.&quot;
