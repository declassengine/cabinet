Thh   On&apos;&quot;&apos;.....-- -   n_, &apos;       iSlS^iiSSlwrn^-u     &quot;   246 /?WAR    CABINET Memorandum by the Shipping Oqntro^llgr. &apos; Hat1ona1 Shipyards.With reference to the Prime Minister^ letter of 20th August, the Shipping Controller thinks it  desirable to report specially to the War Gabinet on the position in regard to the National shipyards and to seek the approval of the Cabinet for the policy set out in par, 8 below.The Shipyards scheme was devised and carried out by the Admiralty, with the approval of the War Cabinet, in the autumn of 1917, shortly after the transfer of the responsibility for merchant shipbuilding from the Shipping Controller to the Admiralty Controller (Sir E. Geddes).   The Yards were transferred, to the shipping Controller, by arrangement with the First Lord of the Admiralty (Sir E.Geddes), as from November 1918, with Lord Pirrie in the capacity of controller General of Merchant Shipbuilding,    The Shipping Controller is therefore only concerned with them as from 1st November 1918,The essential features of the original scheme were:-i. Military and prisoner labour to be used both for shipyard construction and shipbuilding.li.The yards not to be complete shipbuilding yards but tc assemble the ships from material fabricated at inland constructional iron and steel works and complete them for sea.Consequently they were not intended to be shipyards in the ordinary sense.Various modifications were, made by the Admiralty from time to time during 1918 in the original conception, for reasons into which it Is not now necessary to enter.  The position at the end of 1918 was this:-- 1 -
(a)    Orders had been given by the Shipping Controller to demobilise all military labour by January 15th 1919.to)    Tho German prisoner labour was about to be withdrawn by the War Office.(o)    Very little oivilian labour was available on the spot.(d) Except for a certain amount of hostel accommodationpractically no housing was available for civilian labour.(e) Only one of the Yards (Chepstow) was sufficiently advanced to begin shipbuilding.The National Shipyards consist of(i) The Chepstow Yards, whioh comprise a small yard of 7 slips on ordinary shipbuilding lines, previously belonging to Pinch &amp; Co. Ltd., (at which standard ships of the smaller types and tugs etc, have boen and are being built) and 6 new slips for fabricated ships .(ii) The Beaohley Yard, opposite the Chepstow Yards on the Wye, designed for fabricated ships only.(Hi) The Portbury Yard, at the mouth of the Avon, designed for fabricated ships only.(iv)  A leased fltting*out basin at Portishead on the Severn.There are therefore 4 geographically separated units.Tfct polioy adopted by the Shipping Controller in January 1919 after obtaining the approval of the War Cabinet to the sale of the Yards (No.514, January 6th,1919) was(a) To press on with a reduced housing programme, the provision of houses being the key to the whole problem of building ships.   The programme was at the same time reduced from 2000 houses to 750, all in the neighbourhood of Chepstow and Beachley.(b) To complete the Chepstow Yards for shipbuilding, but reducing the new slips from 8 to 6, and to oancel all contracts for fabricated material and machinery in exoess of 6 ships.(c) To stop all other constructional work except the completion of such minor items as seemed likely at the time to facilitate sale or improve the price.(d) To sell the Yards, giving preference to Labour organisations, in accordance with the Prime Ministovis wish.- 2 -
(e) To retain for the present all the very valuable plant and equipment on the sites, ua this plant would be a great and possibly a determining attraction to a possible purchaser.This programme has been pursued until quite recently.The supervision of all construction work was entrusted to Sir P. Baines of the Office of Works by arrangement with the First Comlssioner of Works, and steps were taken by him to reduce the cost of the houses.Unfortunately none of the Yards have yet been sold, although several negotiations are in progress.   Evidently too high a price has been aimed at.   On 15th August the whole position was accordingly reconsidered.It was decided:-(a) To do no more constructional work on the Yardsj (comparatively little remained to be done on the january 1919 programs)*(b) To reduce the housing programme on the Beachley side.(c) To adhere to the housing programme on the Chepstow s ide.(d) To be prepared to sell at a substantially lower figure than that previously aimed at.The approval of the War Cabinet is sought for the programme outlined 5n the preceding paragraph.The total number of Houses under that programme is 461, together with 21 Bungalows to be formed by the conversion of military hutments, of which there are a very large number, of substantial construction; about 134 houses out of the 461 are completed and occupied: of the balance the greater ; part are in course of construction.The Chepstow Yards are a going and tp a considerable extent a self-contained concern.   8 large ships (4 fabricated) are under construction, aid the Yards have orders and material for 2 more: the whole 10 have already been sold at prices substantially above probable cost.   To man fully the 8 large slips now ready at least 2,400 men are required: at present only 1,050 are employed, and owing mainly to the acute housing shortage at Chepstow.no more labour can be obtained until houses are available: meanwhile shipbuilding is proceeding
much too slowly.The Shipping Controller is being pressed on all sides to increase the housing accommodation in the locality, and it seems clear that unless Ohepatow is going to become no more important intot;%.&quot;Jly than it was before the war, the houses in the present programme will all be required.   If the Chepstow Yards were in full operation, more than that number would be needed, even if Beachley were left derelict. The Beachley houses are available for Chepstow labour.iProm the point of view of sale, therefore&apos;, housing accommodation is essential. 1 For these reasons the Shipping Controller is of opinionthat it would be a mistake to stop house-building operations or to reduce the present housing progrewme, which has already been cut down from 2,00.0 to 461 since he assumed control,I The estimated expenditure on Housing, including thebungalows to complete the present programme is roughly  540,000.18th September, 1919.
