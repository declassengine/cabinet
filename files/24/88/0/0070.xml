hie, Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;? Government,)et. 8170,Disposal of Admiralty-owned Trawlers and Drifters,Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Bisheries.(Previous Paper?: G,T,8Q57. G.T.8058, O.T.8091,).(l)   My Department have always taken the view that the better course in the interests of the fishing industry would be to dispose of the vessels to individual fishermen, or partnerships of fishermen, and they only supported the Admiralty scheme because they were informed tha-t the Admiralty would not agree to any proposal whioh would not benefit the whole of the fishermen who had served in the War - some 45,000 men.(2)   It has, throughout, been felt that though the Admiraltyschema was the best which could be devised for scouring this object,the benefit likely to be conferred upon each individual was so small as to be barely appreciable.(3)   Any reduction of this benefit would, in my opinion, deprive the scheme of all practical utility,     I do not, therefore, feel able to support either the modified proposals of the Admiralty, or, a fortiori, those put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I would suggest that any attempt to dispose of the vessels on the lines of the Admiralty scheme should be abandoned.(4)   In that event it would, in view of the hopes which have been raised, be necessary to providealtematize4 and I would suggestthat the scheme which has always been favoured by my Department should be revived, and that the vessels, or a proportion of them, should be disposed of by selling them to individual fishermen, or partnerships of fishermen, on easy terms of payment.The lines upon which I would propose that this should be done are a3 follows&apos;.&quot;(a) A certain number of the vessels should be Bet aside for the purpose, and be allocated to the English and Scottish Fishery Departments in proportion to the pre-war number of trawlers and drifters in each country;(b) The vessels should be placed in the hands of individual fishermen, or partnerships of fishermen, at such prices aB the Fishery Departments decide to represent their actual commercial value;(c) Until the whole of the purchase price is paid, the vessel Bhould remain the property of the Fishery Department concerned, who would act as owners and manage and maintain the vessels and sell their catch, taking all the owner&apos;e share of the profits, the fisherman or fishermen interested in the vessel receiving only their ordinary pay and shares as skippers or members of the crew;(d) All owners1 profits should be allocated by the Department to the payment of the purchase price.    These sums could be supplemented at will by contributions from the fishermen but of their shares, thus accelerating the payment for the vessel
(B)   By this moans the Department would secure that the Teasels were maintained and kept in good condition, and the fishermen would only have to pay off the price from the vessel&apos;s actual earnings, and not -be bound to find fixed sums &quot;for ins-fceJmerrtai in bad seasons when, the vessels had earned little or nothing.    At the same time they would have every inducement to fish steadily to pay off the money and become owners.(6)   I would point out that, so far as I am aware, this would meet the views of fishermen, many of whom have applied to the . Board for facilities for purchasing vessels, though -no spontaneous suggestion upon the lines of the Admiralty scheme has ever been made by them.*, (V)   I have no doubt that, in the long&apos; run, it would be to the advantage of tho Treasury to give, fishermen, opportunities of purchasing, and so to increase the number of buyers in competition for the vessels.    If competition is restricted to existing owners, the market will be a very emav-l one, and a very serious fall ef prices is inevitable when it is realised that the whole of the trawlers in the hands of the Admiralty, as well as those to be recovered from the Germans under the Peace terms, must be sold within a oomparatively short period.L.   of   P*September, 1919.
