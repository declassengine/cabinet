General.The Trades Union Congress.The proceedings of the Trades Union Congress held at Glasgow last week are sum-marised elsewhere in the present and the preceding issues. It will be remembered that last week an attempt was made to provide an historical setting for what appeared likely to be the most important developments at the Congress. It is now proposed to deal with and attempt to weigh the significance of the more momentous happenings as they actually occurred at the Congress. These are as follows : the vote on the Nationalisation of the Mines, the debate on Direct Action, the vote on the resolution concerning Russia and Conscription, and the reception of Mr. Brownlie&apos;s apologia for his letter on increased production.(01887)  255  9/19  h &amp; s 2 L
Nationalisation of the Mines.The resolution proposed by Mr. Smillie and seconded by Mr. Thomas called upon Congress (1) to reject the Government scheme for the future conduct of the mining industry, (2) to co-operate with the Miners&apos; Federation in compelling the Government to adopt the Sankey Report, (3) to send a deputation to the Prime Minister and (4) to order the calling of a Special Congress in the event of the Government still refusing to accept the majority report. However it be interpreted the adoption of the resolution by 4,478,000 to 77,000 must be regarded as an event of the first magnitude. It is true that the resolution merely pledges Congress to &quot; co-operate with the Miners&apos; Federation to the fullest extent&quot; without specifying the kind and degree of that co-operation but the delegates could hardly fail to be aware that in the last resort they might be asked to concur in a national miners&apos; strike and that in voting for the resolution they were going some considerable way towards incurring an honourable obligation to support the miners in that event, either by &quot; keeping the ring &quot; while being ready with financial aid, or by simultaneous strike action. It was anything but a snatch vote taken in a moment of exuberance from persons who had not weighed the implications of the resolution for the gravity of the issue had been set forth in the Presidents Address two days before and the whole matter had already been vigorously discussed on the motion for reference back of the Special Congress paragraph. Thus far the vote might seem a first step leading inevitably, should the Government stand firm, to an attempt to enforce the nationalisation of the mines by direct action, and the strong feeling evinced by the delegates during the course of the debate lends colour to the view that Congress passed the resolution with the full intention of going the whole way should the need arise ; but before that view is accepted, certam factors lying a little below the surface have to be weighed. In the first place the Special Congress could hardly plunge its constituent unions into such an adventure without first ordering a ballot of members to be taken; and the consciousness that there must be considerable delay and many awkward corners to be negotiated before action could be taken must hava lightened the sense of responsibility; the more so as the part played in the past by the miners in the Trade Union movement makes it highly probable that other unions would not be too ready with either financial aid or industrial action in support of their demands. In the second place it is to be noted that the resolution was supported by those who are known to be opposed to Direct Action; snd whose inclinations and interests are all on the side of inducing Labour to attain its political ends by increase of political power. It may be surmised that these, with an eye on the next election, were well content to support the resolution, not with any idea of drifting into Direct Action, but simply on the ground that an overwhelming Congress majority in favour of nationalisa-tion would be excellent electioneering material. Yet even Labour politicians may reckon without their host, and the temper displayed among the rank and file of delegates suggests that the strategists may find themselves carried much further along the path leading to Direct Action than they have at present any intention of going.The Debate on Direct Action.Before the vote on the motion for reference back was taken, Mr. Tom Shaw had asked the President whether in the event of the motion being carried, an opportunity for discussing the Direct Action policy would be given, and the reply had been in the afhrma-tive. Accordingly, on the Thursday, Mr. Shaw himself moved that &quot; This Congress declares against the principle of industrial action in purely political matters.&quot; There was an air of unreality about the whole debate. The motion was too abstract and the speeches too academic. Mr. Shaw waved aside the difiiculty of defining &quot; purely political matters &quot; but without definition the motion meant anything or nothing. Yet the debate served some useful purpose. It served to reveal diverse currents of thought and radically different ideas of the path and even the goal of industrial and political endeavour. It made clear the position of those who are content to depend on the ballot box for achieving political ends, those who would be prepared to threaten industrial action on concrete issues when a Government acts without mandate or goes back on its pledges, and those who believe, in the words of Mr. Frank Hodges, that &quot; The antagonism between political and direct action will grow. It will reach its pinnacle when the industrial classes challenge the existence of the capitalist system.&quot; Just as the debate was getting into full swing the President accepted a motion for &quot; the previous question &quot; which, being put resulted in a vote of 2,225,000 to 2,086,000 in favour of the debate ceasing and no vote being taken on the resolution. No inferences can be drawn from this vote, except perhaps that had there been unmistakable signs that a large majority would be secured for or against Mr. Shaw&apos;s resolution the motion for &quot; the previous question &quot; would have been rejected. The
view expressed by Mr. J. H. Thomas in his contribution to the debate--that a vote either way would be a source of embarrassment to the Congress and the Labour Party probably influenced more than anything else the carrying of &quot; the previous question.&apos;&apos; It is common knowledge, indeed, that the moving of &quot; the previous question &quot; was arranged beforehand by those who took that view.Conscription and Russia,The passing, with only two dissentients, of Mr. Thomas&apos;s resolution calling for the repeal of the Conscription Acts and the immediate withdrawal of the troops from Russia and ordering the calling of a special congress in the event of this demand not being complied with, must be considered not only in the light of the discussion which took place upon it but also with reference to the resolutions bearing upon Direct Action which had pre-ceded it. Three full-dress debates on the general issue or on particular phases of it had already taken place, and the delegates could not this time be in doubt that in ordering a special congress they were paying their addresses to Direct Action and committing them-selves deeply, for a special congress which decided not to act upon the issue on which it had been summoned, or which, deciding to act, found it could not carry the Trade Union movement with it, would, as the President had said, be a &quot; tragic fiasco.&quot; It should also be noted that among all the questions mentioned during the three debates as possible matters for Direct Action, conscription and intervention in Russia most nearly approach the &quot;purely political &quot; and that it was precisely these which commanded virtual unanimity. Yet here again the apparent committal of Congress to a course leading toward Direct Action must be viewed in the light of electioneering strategy. Russia and conscription will be two of the principal planks in the Labour Party platform for the next election, and it serves the Labour Party&apos;s book very well to have a united Congress behind them on these points.Mr. Broivnlirfs Letter.The strongest impression left by the incident of the Brownlie letter is one of Labour with its temper on edge at the talk of &quot; increased production &quot; and ready to bristle at the mention of the subject. Mr. Brownlie has made matters worse, not better. Had he taken the line of examining the &quot;grounds of the vague but widespread resentment at all exhortations to increase output, admitted and underlined such as were valid, and then proceeded to urge that, when all had been said about the waste of such wealth as was bring already produced and the obstacles placed in the way of production by other classes than the wage-earners, it still remained the duty of Trade Unionists to increase output as far as lay in its power, he might have got past the annoyance of the delegates. As it was, he left all these things to be expressed by others, and the upshot of the incident was a distinct crystallisation throughout the Congress of what had before been merely a vaguo feeling of irritation. It will be more difficult than ever to appeal for increased output with any prospect of success. -The net result of the incidents discussed above in the attitude of Congress as the week proceeded appeared to be an increased inclination toward extreme courses on the part of the delegates on the floor of the hall, coupled with an increased or at any rate undiminished conservatism on the part of the responsible leaders of the Congress. The constitution of the new Parliamentary Committee, the personnel of which, taken all round, is anything but extremist, goes some way towards nullifying the effect of the several votes of censure passed on the old Committee, and discounts conclusions that might otherwise be drawn from the voting on the critical resolutions. It has to be remembered, however.) that the nominations for the Parliamentary Committee are made several months before Congress meets, and in this case, so rapidly have events moved of late, men who would almost certainly have been elected had the nominations been made at the Congress were not eligible for election. But even more, the sectional bargaining and manoeuvring that takes place in connection with every election of the Parliamentary Committee makes the constitution of the Committee a very poor reflex of the temper of the Congress. Yet the fact that no miners&apos; representative finds a seat on the new Committee is an indication that the Trade Union movement would not be found to be whole-heartedly behind the miners if it comes to the test.(C 1887)2L 2
Part II. Departmental.Functions of the Local Employment Committees and the Employment Councils.A steady expansion continues in the functions of the local bodies called into being by the Ministry of Labour in connection with employment, demobilisation, and resettlement. This development is taking place more especially on the administrative side as distinct from the advisory work which they were originally asked to perform ; and, as the associa-tion with a Government department of non-official committees performing administrative duties has not hitherto been of common occurrence, it will not be without interest to summarise the changes which have taken place since the end of April, at which stage atten-tion was last drawn to this topic in this report.The development, as regards the Local Employment Committees, has taken place mainly in connection with the administration of the out-of-work donation scheme, in connection with which their first administrative duties-the authorisation of an extension of the donation period for civilians were assigned to them. The functions next allocated, towards the end of May, were concerned with the scrutiny, in the case of civilian workers, of cases where it was doubtful whether the holders of donation policies, who had still part of the original donation period to run, fulfilled the terms upon which donation was payable. At the end of May, on the expiration of the original period of six months for which the donation was instituted, this scrutiny of civilian cases by the Local Employment Committees was extended to cover the whole of the civilian applicants for donation, whether their application was for an extension of an original policy, or for donation claimed as part of the original period of 13 weeks, or whether they were making application for the first time for an out-of-work donation policy.* This scrutiny of civilian cases was to all intents and purposes completed by the 9th August, although the process has, to some extent, been prolonged by alterations in the out-of-work donation scheme introduced in conformity with the reports of the Committee of Inquiry appointed to examine its operation. Thus, for example, the intro-duction in July, 1919, of the stipulation that in all cases the applicant should be seeking whole-time employment as distinct from part-time employment, has necessitated a re-examination by the Exchange officials of cases already scrutinised by the Employment Committees, and in doubtful cases, resubmission to the Committees for review. In round numbers, the scrutiny of existing civilian policies by the Local Employment Committees involved by the 9th August the consideration of 185,000 cases, of which a little over 39.000 or 21 -2 per cent, have been cancelled, while 38,000 have been continued for a period less than the full donation period. In dealing with applications for the extension of civilian policies, the Committees dealt with about 89,000 cases, and have refused extension in nearly 13,000, or 16-2 per cent. In addition, nearly 121,600 applications for original policies were examined, of which 16,800 were refused. The Committees therefore examined, in all, over 395,500 civilian applications by the middle of August. The rejection of claims by Employment Committees has affected women much more heavily than men, the proportion being nearly 3 women to 1 man.A further duty assigned to the Employment Committees in connection with the out-of-work donation policies has been the sanctioning of extension of the donation in the case of ex-members of the Forces, the method of review being similar to that to which applica-tions by civilian workers are subjected.* In dealing with disabled men in this connection, the Employment Committees perform their work through the medium of the Joint Com-mittees set up in conjunction with the Local War Pensions Committee, where such a sub-committee exists, or by the special sub-committees to which the care of disabled men has been assigned. The most recent modifications of the out-of-work donation scheme, introduced in accordance with the final report of the Committee of Inquiry, and coming into operation on the 3rd September, permits the Employment Committees to extend the period for which the donation may be drawn by disabled ex-Service men to 20 weeks beyond the original period of 26 weeks, in lieu of 13 weeks as at present. In such cases, where an extension for 13 weeks has already been sanctioned by the Employment Committee, the period is automatically extended by seven weeks unless the Exchange authorities see grounds for doubt as to the genuine desire of the applicant to obtain work or his avail-ability for full-time employment.Arrangements have now been made for a review, by the Local Employment Committees, of all cases where an ex-member of the Forces has drawn donation for 13 weeks or over. The step has been taken in consequence of a recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry, who desired to exclude any cases where the applicant had never been accustomed to work,* See this Kepoit for the week ending the 18th June, p. 4.
-or for other reasons was not likely to remain in employment. If the Committees are not satisfied that the holder of the policy is genuinely seeking work and unable to obtain it, they may suspend donation for a period of six weeks or less, at the end of which the holder may apply for reconsideration of his case and the suspension may, if necessary, be con-tinued. The Committees have been instructed, where there is any substantial element of doubt to give the benefit of it to the recipient of the donation.The modifications of the out-of-work donation scheme in consequence of the recom-mendations of the Committee of Inquiry, have also drawn the Employment Exchanges, to a certain extent, into connection with the operation of the scheme. The Committee of Inquiry expressed doubts as to the effect produced by the restriction of donation to workpeople on short time unless they were off work for at least half the number of working days in a given period, and were of opinion that this rule might present an obstacle to the gradual resumption of full-time work. They recommended therefore that the existing rules should be relaxed so that donation should be payable, for example, to workpeople who were oil work only two days in the week. But as a safeguard against abuse of this relaxation, they suggested that a tribunal should be set up in the division concerned, to decide, in any given case, whether it was necessary or not for industrial reasons that short time should be worked. They recommended that the tribunal should consist partly of persons nominated by the Employment Council and partly of officials of the department. In accordance with these recommendations, steps have been taken to set up the necessary short-time working tribunals, which consist of three nominees from the Council and two officials of the department. , The Councils nominate an impartial person to act as chairman, an employer not directly connected with the industry in which short time is to be worked, and a representative workman not directly connected with that industry.In addition to these extended activities in connection with out-of-work donation, it has proved possible to utilise the services of the Employment Committees in other directions. Thus they have been asked to co-operate with the Local War Pensions &apos; Committees in the administration of the Pensions scheme as affecting applications for alter-native pensions. This involves a determination both of the pre-war earnings of the soldier or sailor, and of the average weekly wages which he is now able to earn. The determination of this second factor, the actual earning capacity of disabled men, has now been assigned to the Local Employment Committees, who draw for the requisite panels either upon their own members or upon the Local Technical Advisory Committee for the industry affected, if such a local body exists. The activity of the Employment Committees has also developed in a new direction since the end of April by the submission to these bodies of applications by demobilised men for grants for the purchase of tools under the Civil Liabilities scheme. The technical knowledge of members of the Committees is valuable as a guide to the applicant^ real need for the tool for which he asks.The local knowledge of the Employment Committees has, moreover, been called into operation in connection with a scheme for co-operation between the Employment Exchanges and the private registry offices for domestic servants. It has been found necessary to authorise the Exchanges to continue to deal, as they did for the first time during the war, with the submission of applicants for work of this kind. But in order to secure the fullest field of employment, it has been considered desirable that private registry offices should be induced to open the vacancies registered with, them to candidates for employment registered at the Employment Exchanges. The supervision of arrangements made for this purpose has been placed in the hands of the Local Employment Committees, who have been asked to adjudicate on the efficiency and good repute of the registry offices which desire to enter into the requisite agreement with the Employment Exchanges.As a further indication of the importance of the work being performed by these local bodies in connection with schemes launched by the Ministry of Labour, it may be men-tioned that the institution of training schemes for women, and the examination of the suitability of candidates for training, has depended largely upon the activities of the Women&apos;s Sub-Committees of the Employment Committees. Finally, the operation of the national scheme for the employment of disabled ex-Service men, which has just been launched, will lie largely in the hands of these local bodies, who are undertaking a personal canvass of all employers in their area. They will also be called upon, among other duties, to decide on a fair rate of wages, in cases where a disabled man cannot earn the full district rate for the work which he is performing.
)Part III.-Press Comments.(1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Imperial and Foreign Affairs.Russia.The letter which the &quot; Daily Express &quot; published on September 5th by Lieut.-Coh Sherwood-Kelly, together with a record of an interview with General Ironside which the same paper printed on September 8th, arouses much attention in this week&apos;s papers. In a leading article the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; summarises the contents of the letter and draws from it the conclusion that the Secretary of State for War &quot; stands condemned as having lied to the House of Commons, while there is a strong presumption that he has misled the Prime Minister and the Cabinet also.&quot;  This paper states that the disclosures are quite in harmony with the facts that have come to the notice of the public, and that &quot; since the beginning of this year the pretence of evacuating Russia has been used to develop plans for strengthening British forces in that country.&quot;  The disclosures confirm this paper in the opinion it professes always to have held, that &quot; Mr. churchill&apos;s promises to wind up the campaign were nothing more than attempts to induce Labour to abandon its opposition to the war on Russia.&quot;   This lead is followed by the local I.L.P. papers. The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen,&quot; however, makes no distinction between the Secretary of State for War and the Government as a whole.  The &quot; Worker &quot; suggests that a secret treaty exists between the so-called Russian counter-revolutionary governments and the British Government by which military aid is accorded to the anti-Bolshevist armies only in return for recognition of, and acquiescence in, English policy in Persia.  It is argued that British capitalist Imperialism is solely responsible for the Russian expeditions, and that these expeditions must be stopped as a first step in the campaign against such Imperial-ism.  The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; thinks that Lieut.-Col. Sherwood-Kelly&apos;s letter is chiefly of importance as an additional argument for &quot;Direct Action.&quot;  The &quot;&quot;Nation&quot; joins with the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; in attacking the Secretary of State for War and with the &quot; Worker &quot; in suggesting that sinister commercial and Imperialistic interests are responsible for our policy.   &quot; The Call &quot; regards the disclosures as but an additional incitement to action in order to &quot; stop the criminal undertaking and try the criminals/&apos;  To the &quot; British Citizen &quot; the Russian problem is a simple matter.   It is merely a question whether German &quot; Kultur &quot; or British influence is to prevail.  The answer to this question is obvious and the &quot; British Citizen &quot; trusts that the appeal that is being made to British democracy to save Russia from Bolshevism &apos;(&quot; Bolshevism was born of German &apos; Kultur &apos; &quot;) will not go unheeded.   In the &quot; Clarion,&quot; Mr. Robert Blatchford discusses the question and guesses that the Government has no policy.  There are, he thinks, two possible alternative policies one to leave Russia alone, the other to send a big army and act with resolution. He asks for knowledge as to which plan the Government proposes to adopt and for a publication of the whole of the facts.  &quot; The country will be very blameworthy if it acquiesces in hostilities and expense without thoroughly understanding for what it is willing to fight and to pay.&quot;  In the same paper, Mr. A. M. Thompson is more positive and recommends the policy of leaving Russia to save herself.,The internal situation in Russia is discussed by &quot;Rob Roy&quot; in &quot;Forward.&quot; He examines an article recently.published in the &quot; New Age,&quot; written by M. Ouspensky and descriptive of actual conditions in Russia. He seizes upon M. Ouspensky&apos;s statement that the Bolshevists, unwittingly, have introduced into Russia what is, in reality, &quot;the dictatorship of the criminal class,&quot; as an additional proof that his consistently maintained attitude of doubt towards Bolshevism has been a correct one. He reiterates, however, his view that the proper policy to be adopted towards Russia is one of non-intervention. The &quot; Democrat &quot; publishes extracts from what purports to be a recent article by Maxim Gorky in which he expresses his despair at the course events have taken in Russia, and specifically refers to the struggle in the factories and workshops between skilled and unskilled workmen, which Bolshevism has induced. In this paper, also, M. Issaiev discusses Bolshevist economic policy. &quot; The Call &quot; reprints a statement issued by the &quot; Commercial Department of the Russian Soviet Government Bureau &quot; in New York which suggests that there is now an excellent opportunity of diverting the stream of Russian trade to the American market: all that is necessary is that America should put an end to the blockade.
United States of America. iPresident Wilson&apos;s campaign in favour of the Peace Treaty attracts some attention. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; expresses his opinion that the President is confining himself to an advocacy of a League of Nations and is avoiding a defence of the Covenant of the League which, as part of the Peace Treaty, the Senate is being asked to endorse. Mr. Snowden&apos;s judgment is that he is not likely to convert the people of the United States by ignoring all criticism of the details of the Peace Treaty and of the obligations which America will have to undertake if she joins the League of Nations,., &quot;whose duty it will be to attempt to carry out the impossible conditions of the Paris Treaties.&quot; Dr. F. C. Conyheare, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; discusses President Wilson&apos;s policy at Paris and expresses his belief that he &quot; sincerely wished to observe his 14 commandments.&quot;Australia. mr. H. Kneebone (Editor of the Australian &quot;Daily Herald&quot;) contributes to the1 &quot;Labour Leader &quot; an article describing the success of. the Commonwealth Bank of Aus-tralia. &quot;Forward&quot; contains an article outlining the measures the Queensland Labour Government has taken to reduce meat prices. In the &quot; Socialist &quot; an anonymous writer,-, writing in a somewhat different spirit, discusses Labour politics in Australia. He main-tains that the Labour Party in Australia when it achieved office found it impossible to administer the &quot; Capitalist State &quot; in the interests of the workers. He discusses the. history of the first Labour Government in New South Wales, which came into office in 1911, and expresses the opinion that the &quot;Capitalist State &quot; proved itself a &quot; Worse exploiter and tyrant &quot; than the private capitalist. The history of the first Commonwealth Labour Government is dealt with in greater detail, but similar conclusions are arrived at. The prophecy is uttered that the British Labour Party, when and if it comes to power, will prove a similar failure.Labour and Socialist Internationals.An article on the Third International, ascribed to Lenin and dated the 15th April, appears in the &quot;Socialist.&quot; It is notable for the constant assertion that the Russian Bolshevik movement represents the pure Marxist tradition, for its abuse of German Socialists (from Noske to Kautsky) and for its description of the Second International as the &quot; handmaid of the international capitalist class.&quot; An article, identical in subject and similar in tone, ascribed to Trotsky appears in &quot; The Call,&quot; which was written at the time of the inaugural meeting of the Third International in Moscow in March. The; &quot; New Statesman &quot; comments upon a Press report that it is the intention of the American Socialists to summon a further International Socialist Conference and suggests that it is urgently necessary for the confusion of International Labour and Socialist Conferences to. be solved and for a coherent organisation to be established, in which industrial and political sections may work in harmony together. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; thinks that it was most unfortunate that the Second International, at Lucerne, was induced to accept a resolution against the recall of British troops from the Caucasus. He expresses the opinion that the Socialist movement generally is in a critical condition, rent with internal strife and suspicion. Dealing mainly with the differences which are arising be-tween the younger members of Socialist bodies and their older leaders, he sighs for the skill of the Capitalist, who accumulates his forces and does not dissipate them. He emphasises the need for a study of the ways and means of Socialist policy. This problem he illustrates by referring to the troubles of the French Socialist Party and records his satisfaction at the results of the recent electorial conference of Seine socialists which resulted, he says, in an overwhelming victory for the policy named &quot; Union on the Left &quot; as against the policies of both the Right and extreme Left wings of the French Socialist Party. In the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; the fact is recorded that at the Lucerne Conference Mr. Macdonald voted consistently with the minority, whereas Mr. Henderson voted with the majority, and the opinion is expressed that this fact, that Mr. Macdonald is working with the more advanced section, will help him &quot; in his efforts to heal the broken International,&quot; and to win the support of the parties that have gone over to Moscow.*Other.The signature of the Treaty of Peace with Austria arouses little comment. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; describes the terms as in some respects more diabolical than those which &quot; the German Republic has been compelled, for the time* Of. Report, 9th July, p. 25.
being, to formally ratify.&quot; In the opinion of the &quot; Nation &quot; the treaty sentences Austria, to a slow death. The reported difference with France in regard to Syria is the occasion of&quot; some ironical reflections in &quot; The Call.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman&quot; is not satisfied that the new &quot; arrangements are in the real interests of the peoples of Syria and Palestine.&quot; The &quot; Nation &quot; reviews Lord Loreburn&apos;s book on the outbreak of the war. Mr. Philip Snowden^ in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; calls for the publication of the diplomatic correspondence between the British and French Governments, by which he alleges an understanding was arrived at between the two countries for Great Britain to render military and naval aid to France in the event of a European war. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; discusses the political situation in France. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; publishes an interview with Mrs. Annie Besant in which she deals mainly with the Government of India Bill. In the &quot; Democrat,&quot; Mr. W. A. Appleton records some of his impressions of Holland.(B) Home Affairs.Trades Union Congress *(a) The Presidents Address. &quot;Justice&quot; compliments Mr. Stuart Bunning on his opening speech to the Congress, and remarks &quot;that it reached the high-water mark of Trade Union capacity and judgment.&quot; His tribute to the achievements during the war of the army, navy, mercantile marine and civilian munition workers is emphasised. &quot; As responsible agents for the national well-being, and not as humble deputies of a cos-mopolitan Bolshevism, our British Labour forces must win through to the Social-Democratic Commonwealth.&quot; His opposition to &quot; Direct Action &quot; is approved. &quot; Justice,&quot; however, professes uneasiness with regard to his remarks on increased production and insists that the question &quot; For whom is Labour to produce ?&quot; is the question really at issue. The portion of the address which meets with the specific approval of the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; is what this paper describes as &quot; his indictment of Ministers for saying what they do not mean, and for tickling the public by subtle phrases and specious promises.&quot;(b) &quot; Direct Action.&quot; The debate of the Trades Union Congress last Thursday on Mr. Shaw&apos;s motion condemnatory of &quot; Direct Action &quot; occurred too late for mention in the papers received this week. The &quot; Direct Action &quot; issue is, however, discussed in connection with the reference back of the paragraph in the report of the Parliamentary-Committee dealing with the refusal of the Committee to convene a National Conference on this question. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in a leading article, congratulates Mr. Smillie on his success in persuading the Congress to come to this decision but interprets it only as an assertion by the Congress of its right to control its own forces. The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; thinks that this decision restores the harmony between the rank and file of Trade Unionists and their leaders. The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; thinks that the vote shows that &quot; Direct Action &quot; has not been abandoned and expresses its opinion that it might prove not only expedient, but absolutely urgent and necessary, in the national interests. This opinion that the &quot; Direct Action&quot; question has been re-opened by the vote is shared by the &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; Clarion.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot;&apos; argues, however, that in practice &quot; Direct Action &quot; will never be used except where sub-stantially the whole of the electorate may be vehemently opposed to the Government on a point of vital importance, and therefore would always amount in effect to a demand for a dissolution of Parliament. Such a demand, thinks the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; would be thoroughly &quot; constitutional,&quot; provided that Labour was prepared to assume power in the event of success. Therefore, the &quot; New Statesman &quot; calls for the taking of steps to secure that the next Parliamentary Labour Party shall have a personnel capable of assuming government. &quot; It is the Labour Parliamentarians themselves who are mainly responsible for the surprisingly widespread support which has been given to the idea of&apos; Direct Action.&apos; &quot; The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; however, has no belief in &quot; Direct Action &quot;as such. Those Labour Leaders, who are toying with &quot; Direct Action,&quot; are warned not to give the Prime Minister an opportunity of appealing to the country on the issue, &quot; Par-liament versus the Trade Union Congress &quot; (&quot; The Socialist,&quot; it may be noted, declares :-&quot; The main and real issue before the Labour movement at present may be summed up in three words-Parliament or. Soviets-? &quot;). The &quot;Nation &quot;goes further than the &quot;New Statesman &quot; and regards the vote itself as a definite challenge to the Government which must put its representative character to the test. &quot; The logical result of the Congress&apos;s decision should be a General Election at the earliest possible date.&quot; This paper, however, follows the &quot; New Statesman &quot; in calling,for the putting of a definite Labour policy before the country.  In this connection it may be noted that Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, as reported* Cf. Report, 10th Sept., pp. 215-218, 222, 224-226.
in &quot; Forward,&quot; declared at an I.L.P. demonstration in Glasgow on the eve of the Congress that he was &quot; an unrepentant Parliament man,&quot; and re-affirmed his belief that &quot; Direct Action &quot; could only succeed under the most exceptional circumstances, while Mr. Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; welcomes the decision of the Triple Alliance not to proceed with its ballot on &quot; Direct Action.&quot; He refers to the &quot; failure of the July demonstrations &quot; and attributes the failure of the proposed &quot; Direct Action &quot; policy to the fact that &quot; the mass of workers, while they are prepared to employ the strike weapon for industrial pur-poses for comparatively trivial aims, do not regard its use for a political object as being either desirable or effective.&quot; &quot; The general principle may be laid down that Labour must look to political combination and political means for achieving its political aims.&quot;(c) Nationalisation of Goal Mines. The resolution of the Trade Union Congress with reference to the Governments policy on this question was arrived too late for dis-cussion in the majority of the papers. The Woolwich &quot; Pioneer &quot; welcomes the vote for the effect it hopes it will have on the political situation. &quot; The mighty forces of de-mocracy are gathering to sweep to destruction the doddering statesmen who have misled the people and brought our land to the brink of bankruptcy and destruction.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinks that the resolution will have killed &quot; the Governmenfs rival scheme of trustification.&quot; In this connection it may be noted that a contributor to the &quot; Democrat &quot; doubts whether the country is yet prepared for nationalisation, while the &quot; New Age &quot; hopes that its impression is right that a changed tone may be detected in Mr. Smillie&apos;s recent utterances. This paper goes on to reproach the miners for the elementary character of their conception of the significance and value of time. It may be true, it is argued, that for 20 years in succession they have passed resolutions in favour of nationalisa-tion, but &quot; nationalisation has become discredited just by the lapse of time.&quot; Nationalisa-tion, in the opinion of the &quot; New Age,&quot; would now be a return to the &quot; empty husks of the Fabian nineteenth century.&quot; The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; deplores the reference of the nationalisation question to the Trade Union Congress, and warns the miners that they must hasten in their action, or else the development of the use of fuel oil will deprive them of their industrial pre-eminence and thus of their power to force the Government to socialise the coal mines.Increased Production and Unemployment *Mr. A. M. Thompson, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; congratulates Mr. Brownlie on his letter on increased production ; nevertheless he urges the need for insisting &quot; that the cOmmunity&apos;s need must have preference over sectional luxury.&quot; &quot; What is wrong with the State is inequality of distribution and of opportunity,&quot; The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; publishes an attack on Mr. Brownlie from the pen of Mr. David Ramsay. He maintains that it is not the country that is on the verge of bankruptcy, but &quot; the master class.&quot;. He argues that the financial policy adopted during the war of issuing currency notes and raising war loans was not necessary for the winning of the war, but was merely a device for fastening the chains of wage slavery yet more tightly on to the workers. Our indebtedness to America is dismissed as indebtedness to American &apos;&quot;&apos; bosses,&quot; and it is urged that the duty of English workers is to see that the American capitalists do not get &quot; their pound of flesh.&quot; Mr. Ramsay then proceeds to outline the argument that over-production is the great cause of unemployment and that increased production at the present time will mean for the workers glutted markets, closed factories, misery and starvation. In &quot;The Call,&quot; Mr. A. A. Watts argues in similar fashion and welcomes the threat of bankruptcy. In the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; Mr. H. Pollitt deals in detail with the shipbuilding industry. He prophesies that, as a result of the taking over of German ships and the stoppage of much Admiralty building, by the end of September a terrible unemploy-ment problem will confront the shipbuilding trade. He shows his hostility to piece work and premium bonus systems and asserts that increased production means a larger margin of unemployed, &quot; which is the employers&apos; best weapon in reducing wages.&quot; He alleges that there is a definitely planned campaign on foot through which the engineering and shipbuilding employers hope to meet their employees in November (when a discussion as to the advisability of continuing the 12i per cent, and other war awards is due) with the weapon of extensive unemployment in the industry. The policy he advocates, to meet this alleged campaign of the employers, is the formation of workers&apos; committees in all. the shipyards, and the formation by delegates from these of a National Shipbuilding Workers&apos; Council, which will make it its duty to organise a wave of revolt among the workers in the industry, which shall be more effective than the series of strikes in January, 1919, and with the purpose of taking over the ownership of the industry.   In the &quot; Yorkshire Factory(C 1887)* Cf. ibid., pp. 220-221.2 M
Times,&quot; Mr. Ben Turner deals with the textile trade. He asserts that there is no &quot; slack-ing &quot; in this trade, maintains that in it, man for man, production is quite as great as it was in 1914, and suggests that reduced output is frequently due to shortage of materials and other causes under the control of employers. Nevertheless he professes himself to be in full agreement with the call for increased output, provided that the working classes share the benefits resulting from it. In the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; Sir Leo Chiozza Money advances the argument that the high prices which rule in this country are not the result of higher rates of wages and that the workman who obtains an advance in wages is a benefactor of his country. In the &quot; Democrat,&quot; Mr. S. Foy enlarges upon the benefits of &quot; scientific management.&quot;   .The Political Outlook.Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; discusses the by-election at Rusholme and the future of the Independent Liberals. Among these latter he thinks there is a consider-able dearth of promising younger men. Mr. James Winstone,in the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer,&quot; writes an indictment of the Government and asserts that, unless some change occurs in the immediate future, the country will be ruined. Mr. Joseph King contributes an article to the &quot; Worker &quot; in which he emphasises his opinion that the first duty of the Labour Party to-day is to make men believe that Labour can rule. Mr. J. T. Murphy, in the &quot; Socialist,&quot; expresses the opinion that in recent years we have seen more effective actual work emanating from a small coterie of independent Liberals than from all the Labour Party, and that with the &apos;&quot; influx of middle-class politicians into the Labour Party &quot; and &quot; the trade union leaders&apos; servile assimilation of capitalist thought,&quot; the Labour Party may become the &quot; political front of capitalism in this country.&quot; In the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; Mr. G. W. S. Jarrett* continues his analysis of the Labour Party, describes it as a party of political opportunists, united only by the desire to set up Labour as a ruling caste. &quot; This superficial unity may enable the Party to achieve power ; it will more certainly prevent its holding or ever regaining it.&quot;Other.The &quot; Democrat &quot; discusses the machinery by which the Profiteering Act is to be put into force&apos;, and doubts the efficacy of the local tribunals for the task entrusted to them. The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; wonders when the clauses in the Education Act (1918) providing for the abolition of half-time labour and the raising of the school-leaving age to 14 will be put into operation.y Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; discusses the Housing Question. The &quot; Democrat &quot; contains an anonymous article on Profit-sharing in which the suggestion is put forward that in profit-sharing schemes, in order to arrive at an equitable division of the surplus profits, a figure approximating to the &quot; capital value of labour &quot; (determined from actual wages paid) should be arrived at and that in the division of surplus profits this nominal &quot; Labour capital &quot; should rank pari passu with the ordinary capital of a firm. In &quot; The Call&quot; the long discussion on &quot;Parliamentarism and Trade Unionism &quot;I ends in an article from Mr. John Bryan, who adheres to his original thesis that the socialist revolution will not be brought about either through Parliament or through the Trade Unions.(2) Ex-Service Men&apos;s Periodicals.The &quot; Ex-Service Man &quot; discusses this week the new scale of training allowances for disabled men, the continued rise in prices, and the scheme for the allocation of the so-called Canteen Funds announced on the 4th September.Training Allowances.It is maintained that in practically all cases the revised scale will mean a drop in the income of men already undergoing training, because of the proviso that the men&apos;s pensions shall be merged in the new scale of pay. This action, it is suggested, is a distinct breach of faith with the men who have commenced training under the August scale of grants. The &quot; Ex-Service Man &quot; admits that a partially disabled man should not receive more monetary assistance from the Government than a totally disabled man, but argues that the rates under the revised scale do not constitute a living wage for the man entirely -dependent thereon.* Cf ibii., p. 222, and Report, 13th August, pp. 136-137.f The subsections referred to (1 &amp; 2 of $ 8) of this Act may not be put into operation &quot;until the termination of the present war,&quot;   (g 52 of the Act.)X Cf. Reports, 3rd September, p. 202; 20th August, p. 160 ; 18th June, p. 7.
(C 1887)2M2Prices.In an article under the title &quot; Facing Facts,&quot; it is suggested that the operations of the-Profiteering Act will not materially affect the level of prices, and it is urged that the real remedy for inflated prices is increased production. The most favourable aspect of the present situation is stated to be that so many Labour leaders have made it their duty to insist upon this point. It is recognised, however, that fear of unemployment affords some excuse to the organised workers, and the Ministry of Labour is congratulated on its policy of not encouraging disabled men to enter precarious occupations, which do not promise a steady living wage, nor into industries where there is, or is likely to be, an excess of labour.Canteen Funds.Considerable perturbation is confessed at the proposed allocation of  250,000 of the moneys at the disposal of the United Services Fund for general welfare work among, Ex-Service men in London. &quot; The average ex-Service man is longing for a constructive policy which will bring him prosperity and the last thing he wants is&apos; doles &apos; from the very funds which he himself has raised.&quot; The policy is advocated of the retention of these funds as a capital sum, to be invested in industry expressly in order to provide employment for ex-officers and men. It is suggested that the profits accruing from such investment&apos; would be more than sufficient to relieve such distress among ex-Service men as the State awards might leave.(3) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.The Resettlement Scheme.The King&apos;s Proclamation and the Resettlement Scheme have met with general approval in the Press. The Labour Correspondent of &quot; The Times &quot; (16th inst.) declares that the scheme is so conceived that no trade union official has any pretext for resistance or suspicion. &quot; &apos;Craft rights&apos; are properly safeguarded and not a single man is to be given employment as a skilled workman who is not technically &apos; skilled&apos; within the meaning of the term as understood by trade unionists.&quot; There can be no fear, in his opinion, that disabled labour will be cheap labour, as the scheme provides that the disabled men are to be paid the standard rate of wages for the occupation in which they are engaged,, unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of an independent body that they cannot earn it. One striking fact, he records, is that the unskilled unions, which might be thought to have some objection to the influx of disabled men, have given the scheme, through Mr. 0&apos;Grady and his executive, enthusiastic support. He points out, however, that the negotiations have been conducted mainly with the national executives of the trade unionst and it is just possible that the local secretaries of lodges and branches may not display the same friendlv and helpful spirit. The scheme was favourably reviewed in the &quot; Morning Post,&quot; &quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot; &quot;Daily Mail,&quot; &quot;Daily News,&quot; &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; and other papers.The Training of Ex-Service Men.&quot; The Worker &quot; (13th inst.) calls attention to the delays in the working of the training scheme, which have created great feeling amongst the disabled men at Huddersfield. It submits that full-time men are required to act as local area officers in charge of training. Further dissatisfaction is felt over the delays in the payment of grants by the Civil Liabilities Commissioners. It gives specific focal instances and says that these delays are. eading to loss of opportunities to obtain premises suitable to business.The Conditions of the Unemployment Donation.&quot; The Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; (11th inst.) protests against the proposals on foot to reduce the unemployment donation, and objects to the suggestion of co-operation be-tween the police authorities and the Employment Exchange Officials. The present donation scheme is said to expire for ex-solcliers on the 24th November, and the authorities are warned that they will have to form some new scheme ready for putting into operation on that date or else continue the old one. They must slacken instead of tighten the administration and pay on as humane and friendly a basis as possible and give the Joint Committee of Employers and Employed the right to control the Exchanges, except in the appointment and dismissal of staffs.
Part IV-General Topics.National Scheme for the Employment of Disabled Men.This scheme, which was discussed in Part II of this Report for 27th August, was formally launched on the 15th September, under the auspices of a Royal Proclamation in which His Majesty most earnestly charges employers of labour to bind themselves to take into and keep in their service as many disabled men as their several businesses will allow. At the same time a memorandum was jssued by the Ministry of Labour pointing out that the object of the scheme is to secure and maintain the complete absorption of all disabled men, coupled with an equitable distribution among the several industries. With a view to this, every employer who employs ten. or more workers is urged to undertake to employ a minimum of 5 per cent, of his total establishment, including men, women and juveniles. Attention is drawn to the fact that it is not intended that these proposals should lead to dilution of skilled labour ; and. that it is not proposed that any disabled man who has not the necessary training should be employed on any work previously performed by skilled men. It is stated that steps are being taken to apply the provisions of the scheme to Government Departments, and local authorities will be invited to follow the lead of the Government; and also that the question whether the House of Commons should be invited to consider a resolution on the lines of the Fair Wages Clause, whereby Govern-ment contracts should be limited to employers who give the necessary undertaking as regards employment of disabled ex-Service men, is being considered. Employers who undertake to support this scheme will, after certain formalities have been observed, be inscribed on a National Roll, and will be entitled to use a special official device on their correspondence paper. In this memorandum the questions of training, wages, the Work-men^ Compensation Act, Multiple Shops, &amp;c, are also dealt with. In connection with the scheme, the Minister has addressed letters to organisations in the engineering, ship-building and coal-mining industries, appealing for their assistance in carrying it out. The generally favourable attitude which various industries had provisionally adopted towards the proposals was referred to in the Report for 27th August. The Press has given a cordial welcome to the scheme.Trades Union Congress.An account of the first three days&apos; proceedings of the Congress, which opened at Glasgow on the 8th September, was given in last week&apos;s Report, pp. 224-226. On the 11th inst., the attention of the Congress was again concentrated on the problem of Direct Action. In endeavour to obtain the judgment of the Congress on a straight issue, the following resolution was moved by Mr. Tom Shaw, M.P. (Cotton Weavers&apos; Amalgamation), one of the prominent leaders in the Cotton Trade, especially in international affairs, and seconded by Mr. A. Hayday, M.P. (General Workers): &quot; That this Congress declares against the principle of industrial action on purely political matters.&quot; In the course of his speech Mr. Shaw referred to the resolution as an attempt to get a direct vote on a very important question. He defended its vagueness on the ground that in fact everyone knew exactly what was meant. Referring to the meaning of industrial action, he stated that Mr. Smillie and Mr. Williams had over and over again made clear that their idea of industrial action was to create a revolution in this country, and their idea of government was the Soviet government system of Russia. Mr. Shaw then criticised at some length the Soviet system in Russia, and Lenin in particular. He urged that he was against Direct Action on purely political matters because he believed that the remedy lay not in trying to frame a means of defeating the will of the majority, but in making the majority of their way of thinking. He pointed out that other people could play the game of Direct Action. There was not a class in society from the top to the bottom that could not make things awkward for the rest of society if it tried. He believed that the working class of the country as a whole was bitterly opposed to using the power of the strike in purely political matters. Mr. Hayday, in seconding the resolution, said he feared that if the delegates declared that Direct Action should be adopted on purely political matters, they would lead their followers into a false belief that greater things could be achieved by the use of brute force than by the intelli-gent exercise of their citizen rights. He insisted that the four questions on which it had been suggested that Direct Action should be taken were remote compared with such, matters as the treatment of old age pensioners, the nation&apos;s obligations to the blind, pensions for mothers and the safety of child life, yet the direct actionists were content to acquiesce in the abuses that existed in connection with these. Mr. Hayday declared that what is in the minds of the advocates of Direct Action is purely international in its aspect. Further, he did not believe the trade unionists were prepared to say that they would make war against he State industrially because they had neglected their obligations at the parliamentary
ballot box. Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., in a somewhat Olympian speech, said that the motion of censure on the committee on the 9th inst. had been interpreted according to the -desires of the persons interpreting it. He referred to the difficulty of drawing a clear line of demarcation between political and industrial issues and instanced the case of the rail-ways, and he opposed directly Mr. Shaw&apos;s desire to get a direct vote, on the ground that a direct vote either way would be very dangerous. The motion if carried might be construed by their opponents as a lever against legitimate industrial action. On the other hand, if defeated, it would mean to their rank and file that they were in favour of Direct Action, which they were not. He begged the Congress not to give a lever to the opponents of Labour which would be ruinous to every Labour man. Mr..Frank Hodges (Miners) urged that the discussion that was taking place was academic, it disposed of nothing, it simply asked the Congress to come to a conclusion on an abstract question, when presently it would have an opportunity of coming to conclusions on concrete questions which raised that principle. He criticised Mr. Shaw&apos;s contention, that the desire of the Direct Action movement was to establish the Soviet system of government in this country. There was nothing, he con- 1 tended, more remote from the truth. On the abstract question of the right of the worker to use direct industrial action for political purposes, he held that the workmen&apos;s rights were unchallenged and unehallengable. He urged that when in future a conference is called to give its decision on the question of Direct Action versus Political Action, it should be.on a concrete fact. The President then accepted a. motion for the previous question; which was carried by 2,255,000 votes to 2,080.000.A number of resolutions were then carried with little or no discussion. A resolution was passed that the G-overnment should assume control of the whole of the banking of the country. A resolution was also adopted declaring that, a policy of aggression against the non-unionist was the only effective action to take if the burden and benefit of an organised fight for better conditions were to be equitably shared, and another was passed in favour of the linking up of all labour federations in a real industrial parliament of labour in order that the Trade Union movement might in future adopt a common policy, and speak with a united voice on all questions of national and international importance. The Coal Porters&apos; Union proposed an instruction to the Parliamentary Committee to take action on the question of an amalgamation of all trade unions into one organisation with the Parliamentary Committee as its executive. This was rejected. A composite resolution affirming the principle of a 44-hour week, and that systematic overtime should be declared illegal and instructing the Parliamentary Committee to introduce a Bill on these lines in Parliament, was carried. Further resolutions were passed calling for an Income Tax minimum of  250 per year, pensions for mothers, the raising of the Old Age Pension to  1 a week, and the abolition of the poor laAV system. The Congress also adopted a resolu-tion expressing opposition to Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Police Act, protesting against militarising the police forces of the country, and demanding the reinstatement of the strikers and frank recognition of the Union. Resolutions were also carried regretting the inadequate character of the steps taken for dealing with the European famine, and protesting against the &quot; strike-breaking circular.&quot; A resolution by the Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union calling upon the Parliamentary Committee to co-operate with the Labour Party in securing payment of travelling expenses and compensation for loss of wages to members of the various local Government bodies was adopted. Mr. J. J. Hines (American Fraternal Delegate), Mr. J. C. Waters (Canadian Delegate), and Mr. Arthur Henderson (Fraternal Delegate of the Labour Party) delivered addresses.On the 12st inst. the most important event was the discussion on a resolution moved by Mr. J. H. Thomas instructing the Parliamentary Committee to demand of the Govern-ment the repeal of the Conscription Acts and the immediate withdrawal of the British troops from Russia, and failing this, the immediate calling of a Special Congress to decide what action should be taken. Mr. Thomas urged that the Congress should say in no un-certain voice that the Government policy in Russia was a policy with which not only the Labour movement as a whole disagreed, but with which the British public as a whole disagreed. He protested against the ruining of the careers of boys who were retained as conscripts in the army. Mr. Smillie regretted that the resolution proposed by Mr. Thomas did not contain fully the original proposal of the Bleachers and Dyers&apos; Federation, which recommended the affiliated societies to take joint industrial action to remove the menace of conscription. He gave the lie direct to the statement of Mr. Shaw that all his efforts in favour of Direct Action were for the purpose of bringing about a revolution, and -proclaimed himself an &quot; evolutionary revolutionist.&quot; Mr. J. R. Clynes emphasised his opposition to methods of violence, and insisted that millions of men could not be brought out to begin a great struggle without anticipating a condition of civil war. The resolution was carried with only two dissentient voices.
Resolutions were also passed advocating the establishment of May Day ; endorsing: the attitude of the Woodworking Trade Unions in refusing to accept the system of payment by results ; instructing the Parliamentary Committee to promote an appeal for financial assistance for their fellow trade unionists in India ; and advocating the nationalisation of land, and state ownership and control of shipping, shipbuilding and shiprepairing. The Congress also gave qualified approval to the Ways and Communications Bill, but called for complete nationalisation of railways and other forms of transport. It also supported a resolution on the motion of the Federation of Women Workers, affirming the right to work or maintenance and condemning th.e arbitrary and oppressive rules of the Ministry &quot;of Labour under which,the Out-of-Work Donation was administered. A resolution was also passed asking for the amendment of the Shops Act permitting the closing of shops at an earlier hour than 7 p.m.The following members were elected to the Parliamentary Committee for the ensuing, year: Mr. J. W. Ogden (Cotton Weavers).Mr. W. Thome (General Workers).Mr. J. H. Thomas (Railwaymen).Miss M. Bondfield (Women Workers).Mr. R. B. Walker (Agricultural Labourers).Mr. W. J. Davis (Brassworkers).Mr. A. Swales (Engineers).Mr. E. L. Poulton (Boot and Shoe Operatives).Mr. H. Gosling (N.F.T.W.).Mr. G. H. Stuart-Bunning (Postmen).Mr. A, Purcell (Furnishing Trades).Mr. H. Skinner (Typographical Association).Mr. J. B. Williams (Musicians).Mr. H. Boothman (Operative Cotton Spinners).Mr. J. Sexton (Dockers).Mr. J. Hill (Boilermakers).A feature of this list is that no miners&apos; representatives are elected to the Committee, and in general the conservative and constructive element is promiment at the expense of the more irresponsible. Mr. Ogden, Mr. Thorne, Mr. Walker, Mr. Davis, Mr. Poulton, Mr. Williams, and Mr. Hill are all primarily outstanding trade union administrators of long experience and not advanced views. Mr: Thomas and Mr. Gosling are the same, but of a somewhat more advanced type. They may quite possibly turn out to be the leading forces, and it is to be noted that both belong to the Triple Alliance.On the 13th inst. resolutions were passed upholding the right of free speech for all; welcoming the improvements which had been made in the remuneration of sailors and soldiers, and instructing the Parliamentary Committee to demand from the Government still further improvements in order to place soldiers and their dependents on the same footing as those workpeople engaged in industrial occupations ; protesting against the arrest and deportation of all alien trade union officials on the plea of their alleged connection with Bolshevism, and calling upon the Committee to appoint a deputation to wait upon the Home Secretary in order to obtain a permit for the return of such deported trade union officials. The Congress agreed to a resolution that the Committee should inquire into the methods of raising money for national or local purposes, particularly with a view to making a recommendation as to the practicability or expediency of issuing non-interest-bearing currency notes. A resolution was also adopted endorsing the action of the Con-sumers&apos; Council in pressing upon the Food Controller the necessity for..the continued control of food prices, and electoral reform was also advocated. An emergency resolution was proposed in which the Congress re-affirmed its belief that the only solution of the grave situation in Ireland was self-determination and called upon the Government to substitute military rule by self-determination. This resolution was proposed by Mr. J. H. Thomas and seconded by Mr. R. Smillie. It was carried unanimously. Mr. J. H. Thomas was unanimously chosen as President of next year&apos;s Congress at Portsmouth.The minor resolutions referred to above appear to have been very similar,to the cloud of resolutions generally passed by the Congress. They refer in certain cases to very important topics, but are not treated in any very energetic way. The difference this year was that the Congress really took up a number of the most important issues and dealt seriously with them.British Association.The most interesting paper at the meeting of the British Association which commenced at Bournemouth on the 19th inst. was that of Mr. T. B. Johnston of the Bristol Potteries,
one of the most advanced leaders on the employers&apos; side of the Joint Industrial Council, who spoke on industrial councils and their possibilities. As was mentioned in Part I of this Report a week or so ago, Mr. Johnston is one of the leading exponents of the idea of greater publicity on the commercial and financial side of industry, and in this paper he gave what is perhaps, in some Ways, the most complete statement he has yet made of his views.* He suggested as a basis of co-operation between Capital and Labour that an industry should be treated as the unit and not the individual business, and also that staple industries should be governed by industrial councils on Whitley lines and these councils should be co-ordinated in a Central Council. Full statistics should be published annually for each trade showing the average earnings of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour, the average cost of production and the average profit made on output, not capital. If profits were made exceeding the figure agreed on, it would be a question as to whether they should go in increased wages or to the community in the shape of decreased prices. Industries so organised would have control of production at the source. Under such a scheme the best wages an industry would carry would be assured to the average worker, economic security and a reasonable return would be afforded to the average manufacturer, dis-distributors would obtain a reasonable reward for their services and the consumer would eventually pay the price he ought to pay, neither less nor more.Mr. Johnston pointed out with reference to Joint Industrial Councils that had already been formed that as the big trades such as engineering, cotton, iron and steel, transport, shipbuilding and mining, had not seen fit to form industrial councils, there was a real danger of the 41 smaller trades that had formed councils being swamped by the larger representation that the other trades would get on the National Industrial Council as it was proposed to establish it.In connection with the publication of statistics on the cost of production, it is interest-ing to note as a further recent development that the director of the Brass Founders Em-ployers&apos; Association suggests that the study of scientific costing would supply labour with a most powerful weapon for the increase of wages, which, if reasonably used, would secure the approval of public opinion and of employers.Workers&apos; Union.The Triennial Conference of the Workers&apos; Union opened in Glasgow on the 4th inst. The President, Alderman Beard of Birmingham, denounced the policy of &quot; ca&apos;canny,&quot; and stated that they were making headway on the question of amalgamation and had practically agreed to link up with the N.A.U.L. and the M.E.A.f A long debate took place on resolutions urging the Executive to apply for admission to the Triple Alliance and to take a national ballot on the complete unity of all labour bodies for industrial purposes, but on a vote the previous question was carried. The conference demanded the abolition of conscription. On the 15th inst. it was agreed to support the demand for a 44-hour week and to demand two weeks&apos; holiday with pay. The Chairman said that the establish-ment of the annual holiday would help to relieve unemployment. The conference ex-pressed the opinion that all incomes of  300 should be exempted from Income Tax with an allowance of  50 for every child. It was unanimously agreed that joint councils of officials and workers should be established in all Government Departments. On the 16th inst. the convener of the Standing Orders Committee reported that the Committee had accepted an emergency resolution stating &quot; that in the event of a special conference being called by the Trades Congress to enforce nationalisation of mines and the withdrawal from Russia, this Conference instructs our delegates to vote in favour of Direct Action.&quot; The Chairman made what is ratherlan interesting, and might prove a significant, ruling, namely, that the motion was out of order, on the ground that there must be a ballot of members before the Executive could authorise a national strike. This instance suggests that if a Special Conference were to be called by the Trade Union Congress on either of the possible issues, and if it were to decide on a policy of Direct Action, individual Unions would probably insist on taking a ballot vote on the question, and thus the carrying out of the policy would become correspondingly remote. After a spirited debate, the Chairman&apos;s ruling was accepted. Resolutions demanding the abolition of overtime for all workers and of night work for women and youths were approved, along with a proposal for better old age pensions.Forty-Eight Hours Bill. iAt a board meeting on the Early Closing Association on the 16th September it was unanimously agreed to oppose the exemption of the members of a family from the provisions* In this connection it may be recalled that Mr. Bevin (Dockers) also of Bristol, who has many con-connections with Mr. Johnston, spoke at the T.U. Congress on the fundamental importance of finance, which was not realised because it is not seen.t See this Report for week ending 16th July, p. 53.
of the Forty-Eight Hours Bill. A meeting of seamen and transport workers in Liverpool&apos; on the 17th inst. protested against the exclusion of seamen from this Bill.Amalgamations.Meetings are being held in. various centres to promote the adoption of the proposals for the amalgamation of the engineering trade unions. An account of these proposals was given in the Report for 20th August, p. 164. It is reported that in some districts,, local opinions tends to the view that the consummation of the amalgamation is as far off&apos; as ever. One difficulty is that the money value per head of the A.S.E. member is between four and five times as great as that of all others seeking affiliation, and another is concerned with the compensation of displaced officials, which is alleged to be unduly generous. The smaller unions may approve, because it is they who stand to be the gainers by the amalga-mation. It is reported that the various unions of bricklayers and masons are still con-sidering amalgamation and a scheme is being balloted on by the four unions of builders&apos; labourers, which provides for complete amalgamation by the 1st January, 1920. See Report, pp. 52 and 77. The amalgamation of the Postmen&apos;s Federation, the Fawcett Association and the Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos; Association, which has been for long the subject of negotiation, Was finally approved at a series of conferences which were held in London this week.&quot; Industrial Democracy for Mines,.&quot;The South Wales Socialist Society has published a pamphlet entitled &quot; Industrial Democracy for Mines &quot; a sequel-to &quot; The Miners&apos; Next Step,&quot; which it claims to be &quot; the considered conclusion of a large body of working miners.&quot; It may be worth while referring to it at some length, since its predecessor proved to be of importance, and the subject with which it deals is a very prominent one at the present time. Its chief point is that the workers should force the State to recognise two principles, when any industry is to be nationalised, (1) democratic control, and (2) the limitation of industrial effort. Nationalisation is no improvement on capitalism for the miners, if they are to be under the control of a Minister responsible to Parliament and to be exploited for public revenue in place of private profit. Joint control for obvious reasons offers an alluring prospect to &quot; leaders,&quot; but so long as unlimited production remains the basis of the system, to the work-ing miner it simply implies a change of masters.The pamphlet proposes that ownership should be vested in the State on behalf of the nation and that the State should organise and &quot; fix &quot; the demand for the product of the industry. The charges which the industry would be called upon to bear would be known and definite. When the required output is estimated, it should be allocated by the Miners&apos; Federation, as representing all the persons necessary to the efficient working of the industry, on a proportional quality and quantity basis to each local Area Executive which would in turn allocate orders according to the ascertained productive capacity of each pit. One essential condition of the plan of democratic control is the election of all officials, and the control and management of all individual mines by the miners actually working therein. This will ensure harmonious relations between the technical staff and the manual worker who will then &quot; scrap &quot; those customs and rules which act in restraint of production, and insist, in their own interests, on a higher rate of efficiency. Above the pit and colliery committees, there are three &quot; conditioning controls &quot; which the workers would exercise. First is the Lodge, which would become a deliberative assembly to regulate the activities of the Pit and Colliery Committees. Next is the Local Area Executive and Conference, which would serve as a means of clearing up disputes between its different departments and between the executives and the lodges. Lastly would come the Miners&apos; Federation Executive and Conference with various departments to deal with statistics, finance, inspection, development, and supply and demand. In all cases permanent officials should be appointed by ballot of the area concerned and the committees should consist of elected representatives of both the labour and the technical staffs. It is proposed to extinguish royalty rights and pay compassionate grants only to the small owners who are in need. The mines should be purchased but the inflated value of shares must first be deflated to their net capital value.The pamphlet is published for circulation to miners&apos; lodges and submits to them a resolution urging the Miners&apos; Federation to adopt the plan proposed as being the only form of nationalisation worthy of support by that organisation. It may be noted that one of the great claims made by the producers both of this pamphlet and of the &quot; Miners&apos; Next Step &quot; is that they are democratically produced, i.e., that through conference, correspondence, and consultation, they are really the work of the rank and file of the miners, the actual producers of the pamphlet being merely the machinery for rendering vocal their views.
Housing. , .    . &apos;.&apos;Much dissatisfaction continues to be expressed at the apparent failure of the local and. central authorities to deal with the housing problem, especially as cinemas and factories are being erected in considerable numbers. For instance, Whitechapel and District Labour Party in conjunction with the N.F.D.D.S.S. held a meeting on the 2nd Septem.be/ to protest against the destruction at Stepney of a block of property consisting of dwelling houses and small shops to make room for a cinema. A similar situation has arisen at Maidstone, where it is proposed to erect a cinema which will necessitate the ejectment of 12 families. There is also reported to be some agitation in Marylebone owing to the proposed eviction of 136 families in Foley Street and Charlton Street, consequent upon preparations for the erection of factories. In general, the delay in the actual carrying out of schemes of housing is producing great dissatisfaction and unrest.Income Tax.There is further evidence from South Wales that the necessity to pay income tax exercises a deterrent effect on the efforts of the workers. Men feel that owing to the claims of the Treasury, they do not obtain full satisfaction by increasing their earnings above a certain limit; and although the income tax is only a fraction of the increased earnings, they object to paying it, and in some cases apparently prefer to &quot; ca&apos; canny &quot; in order to-remain below the exemption limit.New Labour Papers.A news-sheet entitled the &quot; South and East Leeds Citizen &quot; is being issued, gratis,, by the Leeds Labour Party for the political instruction and guidance of its adherents. Towards the end of October, the Cardiff East Parliamentary Division of the Labour Party-intends to publish a new labour weekly for propaganda purposes, probably under the title of the &quot; Cardiff Citizen.&quot; The prospective Editor, A. J. Williams, is organising secretary of the N.U.R. for Wales. In consequence of complaints that the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; does, not cater for local labour news, the Birmingham Central Labour Party intend to issue a weekly paper for the district. If. a guarantee fund can be obtained, this paper, to be called &quot; The Town Crier &quot; will be issued in the first week of October.Ex-Service Men.Ex-Service Organisations. At present these organisations appear to be in a chaotic condition, with no very clearly defined aims, and no very precise ideas concerning methods of action ; but there can be little doubt that their potential influence in the world of labour is very great. The grievances of ex-Service men have been voiced, for the most part, sectionally and locally. But it will be interesting to see whether, if the organisation of the individual associations improves, and their co-operation with one another increases, they will be able to make protests on a national scale. To some extent, of course, the interest of these associations is retrospective, inasmuch as their bond of union lies in the past; but it is too early to discount their power and influence on- this score. There seems little doubt that certain factors in the present situation, such as lack of houses and cost of living, which are already serious, may give rise, during the coming winter, to increased dissatis-faction and unrest; and ex-Service men, it may be expected, will be especially affected by these causes.National Union of Ex-Service Men. This Union was originally formed by a Labour secession from the N.F.D.D.S.S. One of the members of this Union, as an explanation of its formation, points out that in the N.F.D.D.S.S. there are still many branches which are strongly Labour in sympathy, but there are still more which have fallen into the hands of the Jingoes and Capitalists. &quot; The Federation as a whole is like a boat in which half the crew are pulling one way and half the other, so the boat gets nowhere.&quot; The National Union of ex-Service Men claims to be a strong fighting organisation of discharged and demobilised service men inside, and in close sympathy with, the general Labour movement. According to an official manifesto, it exists to fight for the special interests of ex-Servcie men, to secure justice for the disabled, to look after the dependants of the fallen, and to emphasise the fact that the general interests of the ex-Service men are absolutely identical with those of all their fellow-workers. The Union declares that it will fight shoulder to shoulder with organised labour in the common struggle for the good of all. The Union, reports that it has at present 50 branches fully established, and that 20 are in process of formation.  Its organ is the &quot; New World.&quot;N.F.D.D.S.S.-Owing to the publicity given by the Bulletin of this Society to the Anti-Bolshevik film which they are producing, there is reported to be a movement in the(C 1887) 2 N
Part V. Departmental and District Reports. (1) Departmental Reports.Appointments Department.Appeal hij the Minister. Arrangements for the issue of an appeal by the Minister on the question of training vacancies and premiums are now complete. The letters covering the appeal to the professional societies will be issued this week.Vacancies in Government Departments. The offices of the Selection Board dealing with vacancies in Government Offices are situated at the Howard Hotel, Norfolk Street, Strand. At present two panels are at work and arrangements have been made to enable the number to be increased to six as soon as necessity arises.Training Department.Training Facilities. Negotiations are in progress for the acquisition of the Albert Factory, Cathcart, which it is desired to utilise as an instructional factory for the building trades. The Office of Works have been asked to find premises in the County of Middlesex suitable for the establishment of three centres for training in different classes of work, each -to provide accommodation for 150 men. At the Government Instructional Factory at the Manchester City Hall, a clicking and closing class for hand-sewn boot and shoe uppers is being set up.Wireless Telegraphy. A trade information memorandum on training for wireless telegraphy was issued on the 8th September. The memorandum deals mainly with the training facilities provided by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company, by whom 80 vacancies are offered for training ex-Service men in the company&apos;s own School of Wireless Telegraphy. Candidates must possess certain technical and physical qualifications and will be examined by the company&apos;s medical adviser. These vacancies are open to a limited class of men, but it is hoped that it will be possible to make other arrangements with regard to men desiring training in wireless telegraphy who do not reach the standard required by the company.Employment Department.Work of the Courts of Referees. Up to the week ending the 4th September 299,792 claims to out-of-work donation had been referred to appeals officers in Great Britain. Of this number 274,476 cases had been heard by the Courts of Referees. An analysis of 258,466 claims heard shows that 65,142 were allowed, 192,820 were disallowed, and in 504 cases a compromise was arranged. The proportion of disallowances to claims heard was therefore 74*6 per cent. Of the total disallowances 49&apos;7 per cent, were disallowed owing to refusal to accept suitable employment.Prosecution for Fraud. Up to the 12th September 1,268 cases had been referred to the solicitor with a view to prosecution for attempted fraud in connection with out-of-work donation.  The solicitor has reported on 762 cases.  In 491 instances the defendants were fined, in 113 sentences of imprisonment were passed, and in 50 cases the defendant was-bound over.   In 108 cases summonses were dismissed.Unemployment. On the 5th September 433,591 men and 105,565 women were on the live register, and vacancies remained available for 38,806 men and 43,796. women.  TheCinema Operators&apos; Branch of the E.T.U. not to handle such films, on the ground that they are &quot; attacks on trade unions.&quot;Amalgamation of Ex-Service Organisations. In the Leeds area, it is reported, progress is being made with the amalgamation of the Discharged Soldiers&apos; Association and the Comrades of the Great War. There is said to be friction between these bodies and the local Trades Councils, on the ground that the former are opposed to Trade Union principles.Ex-Service Men&apos;s March.-Th.e much-advertised march of unemployed ex-Service men from Manchester to London to lay their grievance before the Minister of Labour, in which it was originally projected that several thousand would participate (see this Report for the 20th August, p. 165) actually started on the 14th inst., but only 28 men took the road. They are marching about 16 miles per day, and every evening a meeting is held and a resolution is submitted, which concludes &quot;We need work, not doles, the right to live in the land we have served.&quot;
I270number of juveniles remaining on the live register was 27,405 and the number of juvenile vacancies available was 13,974.Joint Industrial Councils Division.Cable-mahing. The first meeting of the J.I.C. was held on the 4th September. The Constitution was adopted and office bearers were elected.Musical Instruments Industry. The third meeting of the J.I.C. was held on the 3rd September. Correspondence between the Council and the Government Departments con-cerned with regard to the Councils resolution on the subject of the removal of restrictions on imports was read. The Council felt that the replies were unsatisfactory, in view of the importance of the question to the trade on account of the low value of the German Mark. The matter was referred to the Commercial Sub-Committee, with a view to that Committee acting as a deputation to the Board of Trade. On the subject of the employment of disabled soldiers, it was agreed that it be understood that 5 per cent, should be employed in each firm, and that, in fact, this proportion was already employed. (See Part IV.)Tramways Industry. The first meeting of the J.I.C. was held at the Ministry of Labour on 5th September, and officer bearers were appointed. A strong feeling was mani-fested by both sides that Works Committees should be set up as soon as possible, and a Committee was appointed to draft a constitution for Works Committees to be submitted to the next meeting of the Council which will take place at Montagu House on 15th October.Trade Boards Division.Brush and Broom Trade. The Trade Board (Great Britain) for this trade propose to fix (a) General minimum time-rates of S^d. an hour for female workers of 21 years of age and over, and Is. 2d. an hour for male,workers of 21 years ,of age and over, with lower rates for female and male workers under that age. (b) A general minimum time-rate of Is. S\d. an hour for male workers who have fulfilled certain minimum conditions and are engaged in certain specified occupations, (c) A piece-work basis time-rate of Q^d. an hour for female workers, (d) Overtime rates for male and female workers for all hours worked on Sunday and customary Public and Statutory Holidays, and for all hours worked in excess of (a) 48 in any week, (b) 5 on Saturday, and (c) 9 on any other weekday. The question of fixing general minimum piece-rates, and minimum rates for apprentices is being considered. ,(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern. -Unemployment. A decrease of over 3,700 occurred in the live register.Resettlement. At Worthing, complaint is made of lack of carpenters and joiners, shortage of white lead, and reduced output.The congestion of the docks at Canning Town is causing great delay in delivery of goods urgently required.The Medway Cement Works, Rochester, are being restored to full working order, and the output has reached two-thirds of the pre-war output.The Road Board has made a grant of  24,546 for road improvements in Tottenham and Edmonton, and the work is expected to start immediately.Complaint is made of the demolition of houses for the erection of unessential buildings. Delay in the commencement of housing schemes is also deprecated.General. Labour conditions have not been so satisfactory, a number of minor stop-pages having occurred. The main causes of disputes at present appear to be the effort of the organised workers in industries with low pre-war rates to raise the level of wages,, and the fact that the unskilled are pressing for entry into occupations usually allotted to-the skilled or semi-skilled. There is distinct evidence that appeal to arbitration has become less and less acceptable both to employers and employed, the reason generally assigned being that change of circumstances, and unfair competition from similar industries not affected by an award, make continued observance of its provisions difficult.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The latest weekly returns show a decrease of over 1,200 in the live register.Resettlement. Few fresh developments have occurred. The housing problem, diffi-culties of transport and shortage of raw material, still continue to affect resettlement(0 1887)    &apos;. 2 N 2
* Judging by latest reports, it does not look as if this expectation is justified.adversely. A chemical and dye factory-is to be established at Gidea Park, Romford, and building is about to commence.South-Western. ...Unemployment. The situation remains virtually unchanged, a decline of 379 in the live register being shown by the latest returns.Resettlement.-The reduction of Government orders has resulted in discharges of some magnitude at Southampton and Cowes. Unemployment is expected to increase in the latter centre, where great difficulty is experienced in inducing men to accept work else-where than in the Isle of Wight.The Cornwall Small Holdings Committee have placed 39 tenants and will have posses-sion at Michaelmas of nearly 600 acres for division, while a further 799 acres have been purchased. The number of applicants approved is 446 and the acreage required over 8,700. Army huts have been bought for temporary dwellings and permanent out-buildings on the holdings.Operations have been started on the harbour works at Bridport, absorbing unem-ployed labour in the expansion of business.General. The labour situation shows no change. The building trade still provides a number of actual or threatened strikes, the majority of which, arise largely from the refusal of some employers to put into effect the findings of the Conciliation Board.West Midlands.Unemployment. A decrease of 2,000 has taken place in the live register.Resettlement. The high cost of fuel, restricted output and consequent inability to -cope with American competition is the reason given by Messrs. Alfred Hickman and Co., Bilston, who have been compelled to adopt.short-time working in their Bessemer steel -department. Over 1,000 men are affected to the extent of working only two weeks out of three.Shortage of raw materials and transport difficulties are impeding works extensions and road repairs at Shrewsbury.At Smethwick,. complaint is made of shortage of bricklayers, painters, moulders and patternmakers.General. Little change is reported in the industrial situation. The national dispute pending in the foundries is arousing only lukewarm interest, as both sides appear to expect that a stoppage will be averted before the 20th September.   (See Part VI)*Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. A decrease of 26,000 has occurred in the live register owing to the -resumption of work after the coal strike. The unemployment rate is still, however, very high in some districts. In Bradford, on the 29th August, unemployment was three times as high as before the coal strike.Resettlement. Shortage of houses is everywhere preventing. the extension of works and the importation of labour. - This shortage is partly due to a scarcity of bricklayers and moulders, and of roadmaking materials. Shortage of pivotal men is complained of in the glass industry.General. Apart from the strike of tramway workers in Sheffield and district, and of transport workers at Immingham, the position is quiet. (See Part VI) Great inconvenience and interruption of work have been caused by the former strike.The workers in the furnishing trade at Sheffield, who resumed work pending the result of the London conference, are still remaining at work, despite the breakdown of the -conference.North-Western.Unemployment. A decrease of over 3,400 in the live register is shown by the latest weekly returns.R,esettlement.-Th.e stoppage of Admiralty orders at Birkenhead has led to dismissals ; but the outlook is stated to be very hopeful. The Northwich chemical industry shows a slight improvement on last month. At Lancaster, trade is good as measured by pre-war standards, but large factories built for war purposes are not yet fully engaged on peace work.
-    Complaints as to the need for skilled men still in the Army are still made in various -directions, and strong protests have been made by the Olclham and the,Hyde, Denton and: Grlossop Employment Committees.! General. The general position is still quiet. Trouble, however, is threatened in the building, ironmoulding, calico-printing, coastal shipping and sheet-metal working trades. The employers are stated to appear rather to welcome the handing in of notices for the 20th September by the ironmoulders,, as they intend to shut down the whole engineering trade in case of a strike.   (See Part VI)Northern. , -Unemployment. A decrease of 1,200 is reported in the live register.Resettlement. Shortage of riveters is still delaying work at South Shields, Middles-brough and Hebburn.  At South Shields several yards complain of shortage of shipV plates.Shortage of houses is militating against increased employment at Hebburn and Sunderland. The Durham Housing Committee have acquired a site on which they propose to erect 100 houses.Messrs. Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth and Co., Ltd., have been able to transfer temporarily to other work a large number of men hitherto engaged at their naval yard at Walker.General. The situation continues quiet. Shipowners are complaining that neutral owners are getting much higher freightage than the British, and that Government control of British tonnage results in prolonged detention in -port. The Chamber of Shipping is to be asked to convene a meeting at an early date to demand the complete withdrawal of control.Branch representatives of the signalmen employed on the North Eastern Railway have decided to take steps for a 6-hour day.Wales.Unemployment. Very little change in the live register has taken place. Owing to the strike of skilled artisans, at the Dowlais works 2,600 men were thrown out of work. Only two blast furnaces, employing 280 men, have been kept going. The company have now given notice to these men who will cease work on the 30th September. The position at the tinplate works, at Llanelly, is serious owing to the shortage of water. Seven of the works are on short time and unless there is a break in the weather they will have to close down at an early date.Resettlement. Sectional strikes, shortage of skilled labour and congestion at the ports caused by shortage of railway wagons all contribute to unemployment. The housing question is acute, particularly in the Newport, Cardiff and Swansea districts.With a view to providing employment in the Merthyr area the Corporation have decided to make application for loans in connection with sewerage and housing schemes. Men are also to be employed on the reconstruction of lanes.General. The industrial position is unchanged. The embargo on overtime by . members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and other skilled men in the Bristol Channel ship-repairing yards is adversely affecting other grades of labour and delaying important work. Complaint is made that the embargo is supplemented by &quot; going easy &quot; on work generally.The coalfield has again been unusually quiet. The resolution of the Trade Union Congress on nationalisation may, however, result in a campaign not free from strikes. The arguments of the responsible miners&apos; leaders are publicly indicating that the resolution implies action, while extremists are preaching socialisation of the mines and the restriction of output.A deadlock which has lasted for 20 years over the way-leaves demanded by the authorities of the dock (Bute) estate at Cardiff, still prevents large industrial firms on the estate from obtaining electricity from the Cardiff Corporation.Ex-Service men are organising in South Wales and actively preparing for the municipal elections ; they have also started open-air markets at Cardiff and claim to be able to sell . at 50 per cent, below ordinary prices.Scotland.Unemployment. A decrease of over 1,700 has occurred in the live register.  At . Paisley unemployment occurs mainly in connection with the engineering and textile trades. Shortage of ships causes a surplus of seamen to continue.  There is a temporary absorption - of clerks generally, in connection with the re-issue of ration books.
Resettlement.-Shortage of flax is causing part-time unemployment in textile trades.-Shortage of steel plates is affecting the working of the ship-yard industries at Paisley.The railway company&apos;s decision against the proposal to run a workmen&apos;s train&apos; between Falkirk and Alloa is hindering development of industry in the area. The decrease in the imports of iron ore and limestone is causing unemployment among dock labourers at Ayr.A hosiery firm at Tillicoultry intend to open a factory at Falkirk as soon as suitable premises can be found.  A confectionery factory is soon to be opened at Stonehouse,, and will find employment for a number of women and girls.A shortage of tenters exists in the weaving trade in the Paisley area. The shortage of iron moulders is also acute in this area.General. Apart from difficulties in the East Coast fishing industry, the labour situa-tion throughout Scotland is more satisfactory than for a long time past.    (See Part VI.)Part VI. Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and Allied Trades.Building (Reading). The strike of 15,000 bulding trades workers, which began at Reading on 12th September, was settled on the 16th inst., when the men agreed to. submit their claim for an extra 3d. an hour to the South-Eastern Counties Conciliation Board.Plumbing (Birkenhead). A strike of plumbers occurred at the Mersey Chemical Works, Birkenhead, on 10th September, owing to the action of the employers in placing labourers on. pipe work.Road Making. The strike of asphalt workers in London is still in progress, as the men rejected last week the offer of the employers to give increases of Is. Id. to layers and Is. id. to potmen. There are now about 500 men out in London and the National Union of Asphalt Workers has called out its members elsewhere.Mining and Quarrying.Coal Mines (South Wales). The strike of miners at Blaenavon (Mon.) was settled on the&apos; 10th inst. The question of paying the men who were late and lost a day&apos;s work in consequence-of a train delay has been referred to the Joint Disputes Committee, the management having; agreed to pay the wages conditionally.  The boilermen have now ceased work alleging that the company is introducing conditions of work which they resent.Coal Mines (Lanarkshire). The dispute between the Miners&apos; Union and the firemen as to the inclusion of the latter in the Miners&apos; Union, has already led to several small stoppages, but failing a settlement a more general cessation of work was expected to take place at the beginning, of the week, when there was a likelihood of over a dozen collieries becoming idle.Lead Mines (Isle of Man). Miners at the Laxey lead mines, who have been on strike for 11 weeks, decided last week to leave the island and seek employment elsewhere.  The men-struck because the company refused to increase the rates of wages when the 15s. war bonus paid by the Ministry of Munitions was withdrawn.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Iron and Steel Trade. A mass meeting of the men concerned in this dispute decided to reject the terms offered by the employers at the joint conference at the Ministry of Labour on the 9th inst., and to remain on strike. (See last weeks Report, p. 232). , The strike has. now lasted 11 weeks. &amp;Ship Repairing. The lock-out at the Port of London Docks which took place on the 9th inst. involves some 3,000 men, the majority of whom are ship painters and the remainder skip-wrights. The cause of the lockout was a number of disputes over the employment of labourers-on skilled work. A further development took place on the 12th inst. when the National Society of House and Ship Painters and Decorators called out all its men engaged on shipping work, in sympathy with the locked-out men, and agreed if any attempt is made to divert shipping, to other parts to call out its members there.Clothing Trades.Tailoring. The strike of Dundee tailors for an advance of Z\d. an hour on time rates to&apos; make their pay Is. 2d. an hour has been settled on the basis of a flat rate of Is. per hour.Transport.Docks and Wharves (Hull). A strike of dockers took place at Hull on the 16th inst. and practically all work in the docks was stopped. Negotiations were proceeding for a national wage of 16s. a day and the abolition of piece work and overtime, and the strike occurred owing,.
(6) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and Allied Trades.South Wales and Monmouthshire. An application from building operatives and labourers for increases to bring their wages up to- 2s. and Is. 9d. an hour respectively was considered on the 11th inst. by the Building Trades Joint Council for South Wales and Monmouthshire.to delay in dealing with the men&apos;s application, which was put in a month ago. The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation is endeavouring to persuade them to return to work pending a settlement, but so far it has not succeeded,Grimsby. The dock labourers who have been on strike at Grimsby and Immingham since 30th August are now supported by the local branch of the National Union of Railwaymen which has requested the National &quot;Executive to declare a general strike unless the Great Central Rail-way Company agrees within a week to meet the Strike Committee. The strike originated with the refusal of the railway company to pay the fares of the dockers in their employ travelling between Immingham and Grimsby.Ireland. The Belfast Dockers who went on strike on the 8th inst. formulated their demands at a meeting held on the 9th inst. These include an increase of 7s. a day for men engaged in unloading grain steamers and 4s. for cargo workers with a reduction in hours from 45 to 44 a week. There is also an application for increased rates of pay for the piece-workers. A later report states that the drovers have settled their part of the dispute and resumed work.Tramways (Sheffield). The whole of the Sheffield Tramway Workers came out on strike on the 11th inst. in accordance with notices tendered a week ago. The strike affected over 2,000 men and women and was concerned with demands for increases of pay and pay for Sunday work. The City Council and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation understood that the men would await the result of the national arbitration on the 12s. a week increase. No strike pay was therefore issued, and the strike was regarded as entirely unconstitutional. Rotherham Tramway Workers struck at the same time as the Sheffield men and they were joined on the 14th by the Mexborough and Swinton Tramway Company&apos;s employees..The strike was settled on the 16th inst. after a meeting of the Strike Committee and the Corporation Tramways Committee, subject to the conditions of pay announced by the latter, and to a promise to re-instate all the strikers without victimisation.Wood-Working.Furniture Trade. The National Federation of Furniture Manufacturers has issued a state-ment during the week denying that the lock-out is collapsing, although certain firms in Bristol and Nottingham have withdrawn their notices.Wood-turning. About 100 woodturners are on strike at Worksop over a demand for an advance of 15 per cent, on their wages.&quot;Glass Trades.Women Workers. Owing to the non-payment to all women of the National 5s. award 300 women workers employed at Messrs. Chance&apos;s glass works, West Bromwich, struck work on the 11th inst.  The dispute has been referred to the Employers&apos; Federation.-Agriculture.Staffordshire. The Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union has asked the Staffordshire Branch of the National Farmers&apos; Union to meet them with a view to settling the strike which has been in progress since the 2nd inst., and which involves about 1,000 labourers. The Executive of the Farmers&apos; Union refused on the ground that the men should go to the agricultural Wages Board if they demand alterations in the statutory wages and hours regulation.-Mshing.Aberdeen. The whole of the Aberdeen fishing fleet is now held up as a result of the owners&apos; lock-out over the question of hours. The fish market porters in sympathy with the locked-out crews are refusing to discharge vessels. About 5,000 workers are directly affected by the dispute, which has been in progress since September 1st.Co-operative Employees.The employees in the grocery, drapery and butchers&apos; departments of the Coalville and district (Leicestershire) Co-operative Society came out on strike on the 11th inst. &quot; They demanded a 65s. weekly wage for men and 45s. for women, and refused the offer of the Society to grant 60s. and 43s. respectively. The terms were conceded and the men returned to work on the following day.The employees in the grocery department of the Stockton-on-Tees Co-operative Society struck work without notice on the 13th inst. for an increase of wages and to secure the re-instatement of two assistants who have been recently dismissed.
Mining and Quarrying.&quot;.    Shale Oil Mining (Scotland). In connection with the dispute over hours and wages between. the companies and the men, and the decision of the Federation of Scottish Oil Workers to call a strike a conference was held on the 9th inst. in London and attended by representatives of both parties.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding.Ironfounding. The strike notices of 37,000 ironfounders handed in as a result of the em-ployers refusal to grant an advance in wages of 15s. per week for time workers, a proportionate increase for piece and lieu workers and 7s. Qd. for apprentices over 16 years of age expire on the 20th inst. The Association of Ironmoulders of Scotland is balloting its members on the question of joining the English Unions in this strike. They have put forward similar demands which have so far been refused by the employers.Textile Trades.Woolcombing. The offer of the employers in the Bradford District to grant advances to-operative woolcombers of 6s. a week for male and 4s. for female employees with bonus for over-time was refused by the men, who demand a 6s. a week all round increase with no conditions as to working overtime.Transport.Railways.
