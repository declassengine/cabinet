IIS DOCtTOTT IS THI PROF^TY OF JffS BRITAMIC MAJTSST^S *-WAR   CAblFST. ^IT ,8158&quot;Responsibility of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for qjjte s t ion i af fee 11 n;i ag r ioul turiaX&quot; lab our ^sm^randum by the President of the Board of Agrioulture and Fisheries.In considering the re-organisation and future work of my Department, I am impressed by the fact that its functions in regard to agricultural labour are not dearly defined.The Board was established to take charge of the speoial interests of agriculture as distinct from trade and commerce, and certain duties previously discharged by the Board of Trade were then transferred to it.    No special departmental provision was at that time made for Labour, but a Labour Department of the Board of Trade was formed subsequently, and made certain enquiries, from time to time, into the ^ages and Earnings of Agricultural labourers as well as of other workers.    Cn the formation of the Ministry of labour, the duties of the Board of Trade in regard to labour generally were transferred to it, amongst these being the responsibility for the establishment of Trade Boards.    By the Corn production Act, however the responsibility for the establishment of the Agricultural Wages Board (which is in effect a Trade Board and is formed on that model) was placed on the President of the Board of Agriculture.    This would appear to imply that the responsibility for matters relating t workers in Agriculture - as distinct from labour in other industries should rest with the Board of Agriculture in the same manner as the interests of employers in Agriculture - as distinct from other employers - are entrusted to it.    The exclusion of Agriculture from the Hours of Employment (No. 2) Bill, suggests also that any speoial machinery applicable to Agriculture which may be required in this
connection should he entrusted to the Minister for Agriculture,*Acting on thiB assumption, a Farm Workers1 Branch has already been formed in my Department to deal with questions relating to agricultural labour other than those coming within the scope, as defined by statute, of the Agricultural Wages Board,    Through the County Agricultural Committees, and its own officers, the Board receive early intimation of any labour difficulties or disputes which arise on farms.    The Farmers&apos; Union, whioh has a specialilabour branch, and the two Unions representing agricultural labourers, also appeal to the Board in such matters.    In some oases, tn the application of both parties^ Arbitrators have been appointed, and in other oases officers of the Board have given assistance in endeavouring to arrange a settlement of differences. As the result of conferences between representatives of the respective organisations, a system of local Agricultural Conciliation, Committees is in process of being set up.    The periodical returns of employment in Agriculture have recently been detached from t^ general returns of employment and taken over from the Board of Trade.I submit that all administrative duties relating to agricultural labour in England and Wales should be explicitly allocated to tho President of tho Board of Agriculture and Fisheries^ This would not only prevent any risk of overlapping or misunder* standing but, in my Judgment, would be politically advisable.,.  With the development of organised farm labour - which is largely in the hands of men closely associated with industrial labour * there is a natural tendency to eliminate all distinctions between work in agriculture and in industry.    It is, however, highly desirable, at the present juncture especially, to emphasise the special conditions under which Agriculture is oarried on.    It is further essential to remove the impression - for which in the past there has been justification - that the Agricultural Departments are concerned only with landowning and capitalist interests.
The labourers should bo recognised as concerned in food production equally with the farmer, and the 1&apos;inistor charged with the interests Of the one should bo charged also with the interests of the other.If, as I suggest, the %ar Cabinet lay down the principle above indicated, it will bo necessary to ensure that close touch shall bo kept with the Ministry of Jabour when agricultural labour questions impinge on general labour questions.    This can be arranged between tho Ilinistor of labour and myself.I shall bo glad of an early decision by the Cabinet with regard to tho main issue.I   03?   P.A   %/15th September, 1919,
