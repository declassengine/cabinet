From Viceroy, Army Department,io Secretary of Slate for India, lOtli September 1919.(Received 12th.)12358.. 10th September. Your telegram of the 1st instant. Bolshevik force in Turkestan at present consists mainly of prisoners of war and is of low morale ; we do not consider it capable of intervening in Afghanistan or Persia without strong reinforcements. Moreover, latest information indicates that Denikin is reinforcing Trans-Caspia with two battalions find two batteries. Distance from Orenburg to Tashkend is over 1,100 miles, and taking into consideration severity of winter, shortage of rolling stock, and damage done to railway north of Aral Sea during its occupation by Cossacks, it seems improbable that all appreciable reinforcements properly organised and equipped for active operations can reach Tashkend before next spring.2. Necessary preliminary to active intervention in Persia would be reconciliation of hostile elements in Turkestan, but Bokharans are definitely anti-Bolshevik and remainder of indigenous population are in the main hostile. Pacification of country will take time unless effected by force, and we consider use of force unlikely as calculated to rouse hostility of neighbouring Moslem countries,3. We must, however, expect anti-British agitation to increase in intensity and be mainly directed to stir up Afghanistan and Persia against us with extravagant promises of active assistance.One great clanger in this direction appears to be activities of (? Turk) Kazim Beg who by his political connections can appeal with greater chance of success to Moslem elements. It does not appear likely to us that Afghans, as a whole, would welcome Bolshevik intervention involving entry into Afghanistan.4. Actual invasion of Persia appears to us unlikely unless there is sudden development there of active anti-British campaign by Persians, of which at present there is no sign. If it were contemplated, only feasible routes for adequate force are (a) via Askabad and Kuchan, and. (b) via Krasnovodsk and Asterabad ; former pre-supposes ability to defeat Malleson&apos;s force and latter is gcarcely feasible, without control of Caspian Sea. Bolsheviks in Trans-Caspia are notoriously fearful of our troops, and if Malleson&apos;s force were reinforced, up to what we can now maintain from present rail-head, namely, one regiment of cavalry, one battery of artillery, and two battalions, we consider it should deter Bolsheviks from entering Persia, for difficulties of transport preclude possibility of invasion in any force.5. Should evacuation of the Caucasus by us lead to loss of command of the Caspian Sea by Denikin, situation will be materially altered, for chaotic conditions of area would re-act on Persia, with resulting difficulties anticipated and Bolsheviks would obtain alternative line via Astrakhan and freedom of access to Persian coast.6. As general conclusion, we consider Bolsheviks will confine themselves to intense propaganda, not undertaking military operations against Persia as long as we maintain force in Khorasan and retain command of the Caspian Sea.7. We have no objection to Malleson visiting Tehran, but suggest that this duty would more appropriately devolve upon the officer selected as President of Military Mission, vide Cox&apos;s telegram of 11th August to Foreign Office.8. As your telegram under reply was not addressed to Cox, Tehran, we are not repeating to him.   Do you wish us to do so ?
