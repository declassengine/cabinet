[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma,1esty&apos;s Governmeflfc]Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1919. .      secret.W^ffiANDUM BY SIR FRANCIS OPPENHEIMER RELATIVE TO THE -$S^K SITUATION IN AUSTRIA.8t09, . THE financial, and still more the reparation, sections of the Austrian peace terms &quot;&apos; have&apos; been drafted on the German model. Such a procedure must be condemned once the fundamental difference between the cases of Germany and of Austria have been grasped. If the.principles underlying the German reparation clauses in particular are riot considerably modified in the case of Austria, there is a very real danger that in the end the treaty will not secure peace, but beget war.The new Austria, which is neither politically nor economically the heir of the late Austrian Empire, is economically and financially bankrupt unless assisted from without; it is on the verge of famine, its working classes are demoralised, the Government is powerless and compelled to pay the idlers substantial wages (see paragraphs 1 to 3 of the report attached). Surrounded by enemies Austria can only survive by leaning either upon Germany or the Allies. The Entente has prohibited the fusion with Germany. In the following pages the grave dangers to the peace of Europe which would result from such a fusion are shortly set out (see paragraphs 5 and 6). The Allies must, therefore, boldly face the other alternative, and help to prepare the ground upon which Austria can eventually rise as an independent political unit. Otherwise a fusion with Germany will inevitably follow sooner or later.The peace terms should, therefore, firstly provide redress, to be granted under all the necessary guarantees of repayment, &amp;c. (see paragraphs 7 and 8); secondly, it should carefully avoid any conditions which could retard Austria&apos;s economic recovery (see paragraph 9); thirdly, it should remit all reparation, &amp;c, to a period when the new State has become solvent. In the case of Germany, the peace terms were drafted to check recovery; in the case of Austria, they must encourage it. To this end, the Allies must co-operate with Austria; she is at present unable, physically, morally, and. economically, to act alone.Even if the Allies decide to treat Austria generously during the period of recon-struction, only a great effort can save her from bankruptcy, so that in the end she may become self-supporting economically and financially (see paragraph 10).In view of the extraordinary complications of the financial problems to be solved, it would be advisable that the Allied representatives should have ample opportunity of conferring with the Austrian delegates, with a view to discussing details before the final settlement is drafted. The subsequent collaboration in Austria could thus be best prepared. There is some hope that, under such circumstances, the machinery would work smoothly and expeditiously.Austrians believe that the first period of reconstruction would probably not exceed five years.The form, as well as the substance, of a treaty on the above lines would convey to the Austrians the desire on the part of the Allies to assist Austria towards a possible resurrection. The danger of any fusion with Germany would thus and thus only  be effectively removed.The general principles in question to be included in our peace terms now to be presented should more particularly provide: 1. That nothing in the terms should hamper the grant of credits or advances by the Allies or others for the supply of food and raw materials1 (see paragraphs 7 and 8) ;2. That Austria&apos;s foreign assets be safe (subject to some form of Allied co-administration) from liquidation until Austria be solvent (see para-graph 9); ^ /     \3. That Austria&apos;s industrial enterprises situate within the new States be safe-guarded for a definite period against seizure or liquidation ;*[778] &apos; B
Eeport.1. New Austria, as circumscribed by the peace, is a small fraction only of the old Empire its poorest fraction from the agricultural and industrial point of view: devoid of natural resources, without access to the sea, yet burdened by the inheritance from the old Empire of the old name, which is misleading, and of its capital, which is a heavy charge.2. Vienna was the capital of an empire of over 50,000,000 inhabitants, attracted by its social prestige, its luxury, its art; it was the financial centre of an empire rich in industries and agricultural production, for all parts of which it acted as a clearing-house ; it was the administrative centre with vast official palaces, administering the Austrian Empire in all its civil and military branches; the traffic centre of roads, rails, and waterways. Its population consisted of a rich social community, a whole army of officials, a world of bankers, and commercial elements, and a limited working class employed chiefly in industries of luxury. To-day Vienna, with all its vast installations, is threatened with a fatal stoppage of all work, a charge upon a hinterland of small holdings, too few to feed the old capital. The factor)7 hands, condemned to idleness, are crowding into the city, a constant danger, because hunger may drive them to acts of despair. The fact that so far Vienna, devoid of coal, food, and clothing, has escaped a revolution would be inexplicable but for the presence of a large bourgeoisie with old traditions, braced in its misery by an extraordinary love of its home and the hope of succour from generous foes.3. The Inner Political Aspect. The present Government in new Austria is Socialist. It consists of two parties the Social Democrats and the Christian Socials, each divided into groups of varying intensity. The Social Democrats rely chiefly upon the population of the city, and aim at a fusion with Germany ; the Christian Socials upon the rural districts, and look towards the Allies for support. The Christian Socials do not agree with the extreme Socialist programme of the Government, but have joined the Government with the intention of acting as a brake. The Prime Minister, Bauer, is a Socialist, by some suspected of secret Bolshevik tendencies, dating from his captivity in Russia and his personal intercourse with Lenin. At one time he was certainly in close touch with Bela . Kim, the Hungarian Bolshevik Premier. As long as there is hope that the Allies will save the country from utter ruin, Bolshevism has little chance of success-though outbreaks might occur in certain districts of Vienna. In the rivalry between Socialists and Christian Socials, especially during the last few weeks, one or the other party drew hope and arguments from the reports published in the press concerning the peace terms good news encouraging the Christian Socials, bad news the Socialists. This game of see-saw is likely to continue until the peace terms are published, and among them chiefly the terms dealing with the new boundaries ot German-Austria, and with the economic conditions generally.4. The boundary question will have direct bearing upon the political constellation, because every extension of the rural area is likely to swell the numbers supporting the Christian Socials, who thus hope to gain eventually a numerical majority.   They have4. That all liabilities incurred by the late Austro-ITungarian Government be divided upon an equitable basis among all the States embracing parts of the late Empire;5. That all Austrian liabilities towards the Allies, the pre-war liabilities as wellas any liabilities incurred under this treaty, be secured in the form of a&quot; dette publique&quot; by a first charge upon the chief revenues of the new state (see paragraph 11); 6. That, generally, a stringent supervision of the public financial and economicinstitutions in new Austria be exercised by the Allies until the Allies deemsuch control no longer necessary; 7. That the old Austro-Hungarian Bank be liquidated, and that the Allies par-anticipate in the control or in the alternative acquire the concession for the foundation of a new note-issuing bank ; 8. That a close economic intercourse be established among at least the majority ofthe States embracing parts of the late Austrian Empire ; 9. That no payment by way of reparation, whether in cash or kind, except in theform of ships or other cessions of existing property under the treaty, becomeclue, if at all, until the Allies are satisfied that such reparation would nolonger prejudice the solvency of the new States.
evolved a plan of constituting new Austria into an &quot;interior&quot; federation, giving a certain autonomy to each province for German Austria is composed of a number of smaller districts with strong local traditions the Tyrols, Styria, Carinthia, &amp;c. In such a constitution the rural element would definitely prevail over the city. The fact that a number of these local areas are mutilated by the new line of demarcation (and among them more especially the German Tyrols) operates at present against this Christian Social plan. The Social Democrats are maldng good use of this imti-Entente argument.The boundary question has also a very direct bearing upon the economic situation of the country, as the addition of certain purely agricultural districts of German nationality [e.g., Western Hungary), would substantially promote a self-supporting Austria with regard to the supply of grain for food and animal feeding.5. Whatever the comparatively slight modifications of the political boundaries may be, New Austria cannot be entirely self-supporting; devoid of all natural resources (other than timber and a limited supply of iron and magnesite) she cannot stand alone as an economic unit. The Entente has decreed that there shall be no fusion with Germany Austria must look elsewhere for support.The majority of the people never desired the fusion with Germany provided there was any other escape from utter collapse. The Extremes in the Social Democratic Party supported and still support this fusion, because Socialists dream of a World Empire, and every gain in territory is deemed a step towards the ultimate goal. Some of the intelligent industrials also support this policy of fusion with Germany because they regard Germany as their most natural market. Yet the publication of the German peace terms has had a sobering effect upon this class of advocates.. The fanatics for fusion, however, continue their propaganda on the ground of blood relationship and national principles. The general aversion to the plan is due to a vast difference of character between the German and the German-Austrian peoples. The latter foresee constant friction and final humiliation yet, even so, life under such circumstances would be better than no life at all more especiallv as it is honestly believed that eventually Germany will rise again, and that Austria linked to Germany would benefit incidentally.6. The Foreign Political Aspect. With a view to the future peace of Europe it is essential that the fusion of Austria with Germany be prevented (a.) For the present Germany&apos;s ambitions towards the East have been arrested. No one can say for how long. Vienna owes much of its historical and economic importance to the fact that it is the most Eastern of the truly European towns of primary importance-a post of observation and a base of action in Near Eastern affairs. If New Austria were linked to Germany, it would become the jumping-off ground from where Germany would prepare a new attempt to satisfy her &quot; Drang nach dem Osten.&quot;(b.) If new Austria were linked to Germany there would be established a German block bordering on Italy apparently the aim of Italy&apos;s new policy. Italy has ambitions in the Mediterranean, which may eventually bring her into direct conflict with France. On the other hand, Italy recognises the new dangers to her hope of further expansion arising out of the formation of the Slav countries on the territories of old Austria. Sooner or later she expects a conflict in those regions. With a view to both these eventualities, she is apparently determined to re-establish a liaison with Germany, thus to separate, on the one hand, her possible future enemies; on the other hand, to prepare, in co-operation with Hungary and Roumania, the encirclement of Ozecho-Slovakia. Vienna is full of stories concerning Italian intrigues, which with this key are easily explained. The fact that new Austria is prevented from a fusion with Germany will at least retard these Italian aims-even if it cannot ultimately prevent them for the border connection between Italy and Germany will probably be established through the Tyrols. It is said that the Italians have insisted upon the incorporation of certain purely &quot; German &quot; parts of the Tyrols into the kingdom of Italy, because what is left to new Austria of the German Tyrols is so narrow a strip on the northern watershed of the Alps that economic needs will eventually compel its inhabitants to join Bavaria. This fusion would bring about the reunion of the Austro-German and Italo-German Tyrols (separated by the present treaty with Austria), because they form both part of an old independent race of free German peasants, tracing their history of joint independent existence back over a thousand years, [778] &apos; B 2
(c.) The fusion of Austria with Germany would, moreover, present a new danger to Czecho-Slovakia, which, on its north-western Bohemian border, contains a large German population, which is not likely to accept the new order of things unless it be treated with generous consideration by the Czeelo-Slovak Government, of which there are at present no indications. The German-Bohemian population of Czecho-Slovakia is the most industrious and prosperous section in this new State. Given the antagonism of race between these two leading elements in Czecho-Slovakia, there is little doubt that the Germans would make a determined effort to join Germany once the fusion between new Austria and Germany has shown the way.The foregoing remarks show the extraordinary political dangers arising out of a fusion of new Austria with Germany. The Austrians, in their vast majority, do not desire this fusion, if they are given any other means of subsistence. To provide the possibility of such a solution will be the task of our economic and financial conditions in the Austrian peace. Unless the possibility be provided Austria must eventually be driven towards a fusion with Germany by an elemental force which no pen can arrest  the elemental force innate in all living things the desire to live.7. Economic Considerations. What is to-day left of the old Austrian Empire, under the name of &quot; Austria,&quot; is face to face with famine and bankruptcy.New Austria has ceased to be self-supporting ; she must be fed from without. The old channels for the supply of foodstuffs have been cut, as a state of war exists between new Austria and the new neighbouring States. Hungary, once Austria&apos;s granary, is herself starving owing to the Bolshevik regime. Under present conditions, the supply of food is particularly costly, because it has to be brought a very long wray mostly oversea and because the foreign exchange of bankrupt Austria is bad. Liberal credits wall have to be granted for the feeding of Austria. Unless Austria can thus be fed from without, chaos must supervene a chaos which would eventually endanger the whole of Central Europe, because Bolshevism would no longer be confined within the borders of Hungary. If such were the case, those European countries and probably the United States which escape Bolshevism would in the end have to undertake some combined action to save Europe from utter destruction. Such action at a later period would be much more costly and much more difficult r,han at present. Any credits used for the feeding of Austria should be provided for and safeguarded by the peace terms. This would put an end to the present intolerable position of uncertainty recurring at short intervals. Austria being unable to feed, herself, it appears strange that a demand for the immediate delivery of cattle should be put forward as one of our terms of peace.8. Further credits will be required for the supply of raw materials if Austria is to be saved by the Allies. Coal stands foremost among the raw materials needed. New Austria has a few industries which are capable of development (wood, paper, iron, salt, magnesite, pianos, straw hats, leather goods, machinery), and with which Austria can compete in foreign markets. The resumption of these industries should be encouraged  to end the dangerous unemployment at home and to raise her credit abroad. It seems strange that under these circumstances the proposed5 peace terms provide for the export of at least some of the articles enumerated by way of reparation a demand which would deprive Austria of the main inducement to resume these industries with energy.In view of the demoralisation of the workmen in Austria, it would be advisable to link up the supply of food to the able-bodied with some proof of work done. The system applies already to some extent in the supply of extra rations to &quot;heavy&quot; workers.9. As the rebuilding of Austria depends entirely upon the grants of very considerable credits, the peace treaty should avoid any terms which would prejudice Austria&apos;s capacity to repay. It should, on the one hand, not unnecessarily increase her liabilities, and, on the other, safeguard her assets. If any sum is at all demanded by way of raparation, payment of the first instalment should be remitted to a date sufficiently remote not to impede Austria&apos;s industrial recovery. If, on the other hand, the new States demand reparation for damage inflicted within their territories, the sums so to be paid by Austria should be fixed by an Allied Committee to avoid after the conclusion of peace a permanent source of friction between these States and Austria. For a good understanding between Austria and the new States will, as shown hereafter, be one of the chief necessities in the resurrection of Austria. There should be no provision for the liquidation of Austrian assets abroad. A forced liquidation is apt to be very disadvantageous to its owner, and indirectly this financial loss would have to be made
good by an increase in the grant of credits. The Allies should, moreover, insist that no immediate liquidation of Austrian interests in the new States be enacted by the Governments of these States. Any such forced liquidations within a given short period would seriously affect the resources of new Austria. It would be necessary, too, to bring to the quickest possible end the Bolshevik rule in Hungary, which is endangering what is left of Austrian vested interests in that country, the original total of which was estimated at about six milliards of crowns. A fair distribution among all States concerned of all liabilities incurred by the&apos; late Government of the Austrian Empire is an important, perhaps the most important, subject, connected with the future chances of an Austrian revival. The new Austria is the poorest section of the old Empire, yet, owing to the fact that Vienna was the administrative and financial centre of the old Empire, it at present holds by far the largest share of the public debt. As far as the war debts were spent within the late Empire, they benefited chiefly the districts which are situated within the new States hostile to Austria the agricultural districts of Slovakia and the industrial districts of Bohemia which the War Loans have enriched.10. The best chance perhaps of an Austrian recovery arises, however, out of the position which Vienna occupied in the old Empire as.the clearing-house for its various parts. If a similar position (even on a reduced &quot;scale) can be secured for Vienna, both the new Austria and Vienna can be saved. It was the enterprise, energy, and financial resourcefulness of Austria in its narrower sense that had built up the manyindustries in the various parts of the old Empire. This presupposes some close economic intercourse between the new States a task which with their prestige the Allies can accomplish, and which need not necessarily take the form a Customs&apos; Union. The various parts of the old Empire were interdependent (which was the best historical raison (Vetre of the old Empire), and, similarly, the new States will be interdependent. Imports and exports will have to be exchanged as in days gone by. Vienna, the centre of the net of traffic, situated on the Danube as the broad waterway, can still fulfil a part of her old mission if the Allies help her. ,11. It is clear that if the Allies decide upon such a generous policy towards New Austria, involving new credits and the weight of their prestige, it will be essential that the Allies occupy a preponderant control in the interior administration of New Austria. Such a control would be welcomed by all responsible classes, as it is recognised that the present Government, deprived of its army, lacks the authority to carry out any real reforms. The Austrians are prepared to accept a supervision as far reaching as that exercised by Great Britain in Egypt. The Austrian debts (old and new) owing to the Allies could be united in a &quot; dette publique,&quot; the administration of which wTould be entirely under Allied control, and which would be granted first charges upon certain revenues, such as the State monopolies, certain taxes and other sources of supply. The Austro-Hungarian&apos; Bank, once liquidated, could be replaced by a State bank, for which the Allies might secure the concession, or in which they could at least largely participate.12. A policy of leniency is dictated by the Allied prohibition of a fusion with Germany on the one hand, and the necessities of Austria on the other. The hopes of the vast majority of true Austrians are focussed upon the Allies. The Allies, by a policy of moderation towards Austria, can prevent the probable destruction of Vienna by out-breaks of Bolshevism. For the Austrians the financial and economic clauses of the treaty must spell encouragement, a policy very different from the one applicable to Germany. This vast difference should find expression in the document itself. The &quot;German&quot; model should be abandoned in form, as it must be abandoned in substance. This in itself would be an encouragement for the Austrians, whose hopes have been fed by the long delay in the presentation of the Peace Treaty.The Austrian people are a sober, hard-working, enterprising people, with excellent commercial instincts and technical training. Thus their character, supported by an extraordinary anxiety to resume their economic life under the altered circum-stances and under the guidance of the Allies, is a factor which is important in gauging the chances of ultimate success. As a people their character is entirely foreign to what is known now as the true &quot; German&quot; character. They are a people not unlike the French in some details, gay, cultured, and chivalrous, and when true to themselves an altogether lovable race.FRANCIS OPPENHEIMER.Paris, June 99, 1919.o
