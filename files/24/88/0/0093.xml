They have, however, been successful in damaging Oil Fuel stores, Harbour works and several Patrol Craft, also, on the 4th September, a large Destroyer which was directing the operations of two Minesweepers and whioh had to be towed into Cronstadt by them at the end of the engagement.       Another Destroyer, which came out to her assistance, was also driven back into harbour by Bombs and Machine Guns,,8,-      I have, on two different occasions, laid mines close up to Cronstadt, and close inshore, by neans of the Coastal Motor Boats, of whioh I have now only one fit for service,9.-      The loss of &quot;Vittoria&quot; through a Bolshovic Submarine, I ver; much regret.   There had been no Submarine activity for six weeksa10,-      &quot;Verulsm11 also was lost, through striking one of our own mines off Stirs Point at nighto    This is a new Flotilla, which has scarcely yet beoov..? accustomed to the difficult conditions of maintaining the Patrols under the cramped conditions of manoeuvring space, which must obtain whilst we remain here.
11.&quot;     Reliable information, which has come through to viborg from Cronstadt, shows thatBI-etropavloskM was struck by two torpedoes, and is now resting or. the bottom.   Aerial reoonnaissance and photographs confirm this.wAndrei pervozvanni&quot; was holed In the submerged flat, and eve*ry possible effort and appliance was at once used to get her into dry dock, where she now is, and whare I endeavour to bomb hsr twice or three times a wadk.&quot;Pami&amp;t azov&quot; anil the Patrol Destroyer axis as I reported befirre; sunk In deeper water,The Cruiser ,,Bogatyr,, also Is sunk0   This I think must have fcsea by a torpedo fired by Lieutenant AugustineAgar, VaC, into the Military Harbour, which detonated but we were unable to find out on what object.120-       On the night of the 4th September, two hsavy explos-ions were eaen in the&quot; direction of Krasna Ooxka, near whioh we Ivvi lately laid Mines from the Coastal Motor BeatSo    These ware fOBBlbly guns from Krasnuya Gorka or else Bom craft striking a mine, and Finn watohers from Teriocki stats positively one was ir; our miivsf&amp;la.   On the night of 5th September a Patrol Vessel *types in that vicinity burning searchlights;   I think in antiolp-consideration of another Coastal Hotor Boat attack.13,- from time to time our Destroyer Patrel in Kaporla Bay has been fired at by a Shore Battery, but so far without effect, though the shooting has been nuch more aocurate than formerly,,    This fire has, of course, always been returned,14,-       I oalled on the new President of Finland, at HeTsingfora, on 1st -September, and was cordially received j but there is nothing of interest to report rp drding the interview.15.^      .A Mr.Goode, Correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, kind.who professes to be a Seoret Service Agent, who has been in the Beltio now for some months, arrived from Mosoow about 1st. September, evidently with the good will of the 3olshevics, and, from my reports, attempted to act as intermediary between the Bolshevios and  Etonians.   For this reason he was arrested by the Estonians, but set free again-, and 1 have required the British authorities at Reval to send him up here to explain himself,, Enclosure 1T6..3, will emphasise my reason for so doingo..-Whether he is. a Secret service Agent or.not, I consider it most undeeir-able that he should have further freedom of action out here.16,-       ,/itii regard to the naval  Situation in the Gulf of Finland, - the condition of affairs be.in;; that, Estonia, ,yhite Russia and Finland, are now relying on trj rtoroe to protect them from the Bolehevios, but of which not one .1s new taking a:*/&quot; active offensive measures to protect themselves, - it mi*&apos;ht be of value to so inform them, and point out that this condition of affairs oannot obtain indefinitely;   and so this Bight possibly bring matters to a head and spur.them on to combine and take petrograd before the weather and ioe renders canpaipninp bv land and sea out of the question.17.-       My opinion regarding the -Hussions is r.hat thev are proving themselves quite unworthy of further support, by reason
of their disobedience and disregard of general Sir Hubert Goufh&apos;s suggestions as to their dispositions and distribution of Cowhands, their perpetual quarrelling amongst each other, and intrigue both amongst themselves and with the Germans.18,- j.is for the Estonians, I can only ap:ain repeat what is contained in oiirarraph 10 of ny letter Ho.26/531 of 26th August, 1919.19.&quot;      Regardin- the Finns - the;/ are the nearest to Petrop-rad, their Array is fresh and well equipped, and there is a strong feeling amongst them in favour of the enterprise, whioh only needs the incentive of a small loan and the approval of our Government to make them 5:0 forward, - and this I believe now to ho the best remedy for a situation which fyrows worse instead of better.20.&quot;      a further and separate report is being sent by this mail regarding l&quot;.rn Goode (paragraph 15 above),I have the honour to be, f?ir,Your obedient Servrnt, (:&apos;i-r-ned) Walter Cowan,
