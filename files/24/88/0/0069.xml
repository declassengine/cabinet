[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]   218Printed for the War Cabinet   September 1919. f&amp; , . Jj?\ m   /SECRET. [G.T.-8169.J&quot;WAR CABINET.I circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum by Mr. Armitage Smith on the financial objections to the cession by Great Britain of Cyprus to Greece, with reference to G.T.-8090.(Initialled)        A. C.Treasury, S.W.,September 17, 1919.I. UNDER, the Convention of 187? between Great Britain and Turkey relative to the occupation of Cyprus, Great Britain undertook to pay annually to the Porte during the occupation a sum which was ultimately agreed at .92,8001. per annum. This sum was calculated to represent the excess of revenue derived by the Porte from the island over expenditure on the island for the period of five years prior to the British occupation.In -point of fact, the Porte has never received this tribute, for the following reasons: II. In 1855 the Porte raised a loan of 5,000,0001., secured as to 72,000Z. per annum on the tribute of Egypt and, as to the rest, on other Turkish revenues. The interest on this loan was guaranteed jointly and severally by England and- France, in each case with statutory authority.In 1876 the Porte began to fall into arrear with regard to interest, and since 1880 the default has been complete both as to interest and as to sinking fund.That portion of the interest which was charged on the tribute of Egypt, viz., 72,0001, has always been forthcoming, because the money has been paid by the Khedive direct to the house which issued the loan, and, owing to the accident that the conclusion of the Convention of 1878 synchronised with the default, England was able to intercept the sums due annually by her to the Porte (viz., 92,8001. per annum) and to apply them in discharge of the balance of the interest payable by the Porte to its creditors, and thus to relieve the British and French Exchequers from the operation of the guarantee under the Loan of 1855., Since 1880 this sum of 92,800Z. has been applied (a) in discharge of this balance of interest on the guaranteed loan (this absorbed about 82,000Z. per annum); (b) as to the residue (viz., about 1Q,000Z. per annum), in constituting an unoflicial and somewhat irregular &quot; sinking fund.&quot;Under the Loan Convention the Porte was under an obligation to establish a sinking fund for the Loan of 1855. Great Britain and France were under no such obligation; but as the Porte was in default with sinking fund as well as interest, Great Britain decided to use the balance of the Cyprus Tribute left after the payment of interest for that purpose. The sinking fund has been accumulating ever since, and now amounts to about 50O,0OOZ. (nominal), and its disposal is under consideration by His Majesty&apos;s T-easury.III. In order to fulfil the expectations held out by Her Majesty&apos;s Government when the British occupation of Cyprus began, a good British Administration (and accordingly a costly one) had to be substituted for a bad Turkish Administration.The result was that, instead of being a source of revenue, as it had been to Turkey, Cyprus became a financial burden to England. Its revenues were. unable to discharge both the cost o  its own administration and the &quot; Tribute &quot; ; consequently year after year the British Exchequer was called upon to make up the deficit.After some years the system of votes, varying in amount according to the programme of admmistration,&apos;was abandoned for that of a fixed grant-in-aid. When war broke out the grant-in-aid was, and for some years previously had been, fixed at
50,000L per annum ; altogether since the beginning of the occupation Cyprus had cost the British Exchequer upwards of 1,250,0001. in cash, without taking into account the disguised subsidies which the island has received in the form of loans on favourable terms from the Exchequer. If Cyprus were to be ceded it would be necessary for Great Britain to obtain adequate security for the service of the balance outstanding, viz., about 200,000/,, which the island has obtained by the favour of British&apos; credit.As a result of this generous treatment, the island has had the advantage of improvements in its system of railways and harbours, and has received assistance in connection&apos; with the protection and development of its agriculture, in addition to an honest and impartial fiscal and judicial system.IV. This being so, it may be asked : How can the transfer of Cyprus to another Power be open to any financial objection ? Would not such transfer merely relieve the British Exchequer to the extent of the financial assistance now afforded to it, viz., 5O,000Z. per annum, the amount of the grant-in-aid ? The answer is that this would be so if Great Britain were under no obligation with respect to the Guaranteed Loan of 1855, but that, as things are, the transfer of the island to Greece would certainly involve a financial loss to be measured by the difference between the Tribute, viz., 92,800L per annum, and the grant-in-aid, viz., 50,0001. per annum, the latter figure being liable to adjustment in respect of any contribution which Cyprus may be called on to pay towards the cost of the Imperial services. The transfer would also entail considerable difficulties of a mixed financial and political nature in relation to France and to Greece.If Greece were willing and able to take over Cyprus with the burden of the Turkish Tribute attaching to it, then, so far as finance is concerned, the British Exchequer would simply be relieved to the extent of 50,0OOLBut it is tolerably certain that Greece would be neither willing nor able to assume that burden.If Greece professes willingness to assume the burden, then it is certain that France (joint guarantor with ourselves) will insist on material security for the fulfilment of that undertaking. The only satisfactory security would be the hypothecation of specific Greek revenues for the purpose under international control.It is very unlikely that Greece, assuming that she could afford to do so, would be willing to make a charge of the required amount, e.g., on the Greek customs a charge on Cypriote revenues would be valueless-and the proposal would inevitably lead to friction.But if this security is not given, it is impossible to avoid the risk of the guarantee of the Loan-of 1855 becoming operative, and the British and French Exchequers being called upon to pay some 40,OOOL per annum each in respect of this ancient Turkish.Debt.It seems more than doubtful, however, whether Great Britain could insist on the French paying their share. They would doubtless point out that if Great Britain cedes Cyprus she must take the consequences, and pay the price of her quixotic action, the security having been fully adequate while Cyprus remained in British occupation and under British protection.It must also be remembered that the Loan of 1855 is the one Turkish loan in which the British investor is believed to have a preponderant interest, and that the Bank of England is understood to have a considerable holding, a fact of which the French are doubtless fully aware.The probable result, therefore, of cession1 without hypothecation of Greek revenues difficult to obtain, impossible to obtain without great friction would be that the British taxpayer would have to find the whole amount required for the interest on the debt, and that in perpetuity, since there is no provision for liquidation other than the small and irregular sinking fund which Great Britain has&apos; accumulated in the manner described above.It should be noted that it has been a presupposition of all the inter-departmental proposals with regard to Turkish finance that Cyprus would remain under British protection and liable for the Tribute, and that accordingly a clause has been inserted in the draft Treaty of Peace prepared by the Foreign Office which excuses France from her joint guarantee in respect of the Loan of 1S55 [&quot;Egypt&quot;: Chapter VIII,. Article 3].If Cyprus is to be given up this clause must be cancelled, and the Foreign Office will lose the advantage of making an offer to the French which has been regarded as having some value in negotiation (or wilLbe constrained to withdraw the offer if it has already been made). , ,
V. Attention is called particularly to the opinion expressed by the Balkan. Financial Commission which sat at Paris in 1.913.While considering the Ottoman Public Debt as it then stood and the &quot; principle of participation,&quot; that Commission excluded from the revenues of the Ottoman Empire to be brought under review the Tributes of Egypt and of Cyprus, and excluded similarly from the Turkish Debt the loans secured on these tributes, on the ground that the principle of participation had already been applied and was in force in respect of this portion of the Turkish Debt by the existing application of the tributes of Egypt and of Cyprus.The same view has been taken by the Foreign Office and the Treasury during the last two years&apos; discussions, and it is understood that the French Government has proceeded on the same principle.VI. It is perhaps worth while adding that Cyprus belongs, and has always belonged, to the economic and currency area of its Eastern rather than its Western neighbours. It is linked to the British Empire by its currency system, which is based upon the British sovereign, which is sole legal tender without limit, and by far the. greater&apos;part of its trade is with Egypt and the United Kingdom, as is shown by the following statistics, which represent the average of the four years 1910 to 1913 inclusive : 	Exports.
