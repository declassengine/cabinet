Members of the German Government are apprehensive of serious.trouble in October, while there is a general feeling that the reactionaries are planning a coup, either by allowing the Spartaeists enough pope to hang them-selves or by seizing the power.   There are further vague reports of an intention to use the Courland troops for an invasion of Russia to put down the Bolsheviks.  A list of the political parties in Germany is given.The month has been barren as regards newfc* from Russia; valuable reports are said to be on the way, but they^wjtll not arrive until next week.A few days ago Mr. Goods, the &quot;HenChester&apos; Guardian&quot; correspondent, was reported to be on his way with a &quot;Message from Lenin to the British People,&quot;  He is now detained by the Senior Naval Officer in the Baltic,In Hungary fee position is obscure.There is still monarchistfeeling/
- z -ST    - i    - .v.&apos;.v &apos;      &apos; &apos; A3feeling among the&apos; peasants- who are said to be longing for the rule of a strong man.   In Austria the fall of the Hungarian Communists has stabilised the situation,Beports from Italy are not satisfactory.1 $ignor lUtti ia collecting evidence against the extreme socialists, but it seems doubtful whether he will have the courage to deal with them.Quotations are given from intercepted correspondence, showing that the french Extremists are fomenting revolution ii Spain and that the suggested date for a world revolution is ii November.The Russian Bolsheviks are conducting a strong propaganda camnaign in Central Asia, where also the Committee of Union and Progress is trying to inflame Ik hommedan feeling against the Allies.Though the labour troubles in the United States hare beei suspended for the moment, there is labour unrest throughout tl country. Production is said to have fallen 30$ and correeponi in the Western States report that returned soldiers are not $ back to the farms. As in other countries, the great increase the cost of necessaries is the primary cause.
Distrusti of Great Britain&apos;s intentions in Syria has been skilfully engineered in the press, especially in the South of France where the agitation can be traoed to the financial and commercial interests of Marseillesi and lyons.   The attacks on the British Government are not oonfined to its supposed policy in the Middle East.   Great Britain is said to be largely responsible for the high oost of commodities,, it being alleged that the British are withholding shipping whioh should be conveying goods to France.   It is possible that this feeling of antagonism to Great Britain is being fostered as a prelude to the reappearanoe of     Caillaux in publio life,, whioh is considered probable.   The Socialist Party is reported to be ready to aooept his leadership aa he is the only statesman who is considered capable of re-establishing the country on a sound financial footing.Exoept for the dockers&apos; strike at Marseilles, where a certain amount of rioting has ooourred, oalm continues to prevail in the Labour and Industrial world.   The Extremists are as usual endeavouring to oreate discontent among the working olasses and are exploiting to their own advantage the high oost of living.  JUvidenoe, however, tends to show that the interest of the working classes in the principles and ideals of the Extremists Is steadily diminishing and that, in 3pite of the efforts of the advanoed elements, the situation.oan be regarded as beooming more stable every day. The meetings controlled by members of the Extreme Left Party are largely attended by young people, to whom they are devoting their main attention, having failed in their attempts to impress the older workmen.Longuet and his adherents are said to be in touoh with the Russian Soviet Government through the medium of the German Independent Sooialist, Dr. Oskar Kohn, in Berlin,and/
m  2 m.and of L. Chaaanowtsohy in Stockholm.   The latter la repo to be working in oloae touoh with Chattopadhya, the Indian Revolutionary of the Berlin India Committee, who was reoen sentenced to several months1 imprisonment owing to his commotion with the Zurich bomb plot.The morale of the French troops as a whole is repo to be satisfactory.  Some 1500 troops, however, who arriv recently at Marseilles from Russia, gave free expression their sympathy for the Bolsheviks.Considerable antagonism appears to exist between tfc Extreme Left wing of the Socialist Party and the more mode) section under inland.  A split seams probable.tJnder &quot;Spain&quot; will be found information about the ocmpiibity o  Jouhaux arid other extremists with Revolution plots in Spain.BSLGIUkThe active propaganda in favour of France oontinuei and is now taking an anti-British form, but there are signs of a reaction setting in among the Flemings, who consider I a friendly attitude towards  ranoe implies an acquiescence republican doctrines. The popular feeling towards Cfreat Britain is still unfriendly and may be attributed to a dial to eoonomio dependence on this oountry.        /The activities of all political parties in Belgium I are increasing owing to the approaching general elections. It is thought that in organized labour oiroles, where generally more moderate views prevail, there will be strong opposition to the nomination as offioial Socialist oandidati of J. Jaquemotte and other individuals of advanced opinions against whom there has latterly been a healthy reaction aflitfthe working class population.tkmti :.M &apos; ,  . m Two/

Two new Revolutionary Societies have recently been formed - "La Jeune Garde Socialiste" and "La Confédération Communiste Flammande" - but both are said to be already doomed to failure, on account of their anti-religious character and their policy of "direct action".

The efforts of the Liberal Party to regain its former influence appear to have failed and the issue at the coming elections seems to lie between the Catholics and the Socialists. The economic situation remains almost stationary. There is a general willingness to work and the Trade Unions are reported to be alarmed at the readiness of the workpeople to work for more than eight hours a day. In the iron trace a large number of furnaces will shortly be working and an increased production may be anticipated. Industirial trouble is threatened among the metal workers in the Liege and Charleroi districts, who complain that the employers are dilatory in carrying out the terms of the agreement. The frontier negotiations with Holland are a subject of much public interest. It is anticipated that a compromise will be arrived at by which the Dutch will maintain a nominal sovereignty over the Schelot whilst allowing the Belgians an unrestribted use of the river, and that the Dutch will undertake to resist by force any attempt to invade Dutch Limburg.

The publication in the Dutch Press of the confidential instructions issued by the Belgian Foreign Office to the Belgian Army Headquarters regarding propaganda to be undertaken by Belgian emissaries in Dutch Limburg, has caused some oonsternation among Belgians, who feel that it is likely further to weaken their cause in the negotiations now being carried on with the Dutch Governments.

SWITZERLAND/


The Swiss Socialist Party has now deoided to adhere to the. Third (Moscow) Internationale., and the Socialist Congress has agreed by a large majority to oppose the entty of Switzerland into the League qt Nations.Although the Ssias Socialist Party has. accepted Bolshevism, it is numerically wealc and even the optimists of the., party do not expeot to get more than 40 scats at tbi . next election..  .      . .......A new, party has been formed in Switzerland to combat Bolshevism. The strikes at Basel and Zurich, to which reference was.made in the last Report, may be said to havt failed. This may be regarded as a triumph for the moderati over the extremist elements, and a proof that the BolshevI movement in Switzerland.is becoming weaker.John de Kay, to whom reference has been made in previous reports, now appears to be the ohlef anti-British propag in Ssitssrland.   He has always been an extreme fanatic, there Is little doubt that he is in receipt cf German fur for causing political upheavals in England, , France, and Italy.   Ee has : just been reported to have had interviews Zurich; with the notorious German agent, Parvus,  He is in tcuoh with the. extremists,in England and France, and he p with them as a man of great personal wealth.   He paid the expenses of the; Lucerne Conference, and is said to have g 20,000 franos towards; the expenses of the paper, &quot;La Peui Ho is full of visionary,sohemes such as an anti-Imporiali Sooiety with branohea all ever the world, end with a oo of representatives from every country.   Hit&apos; Sooialist International is not very well disposed towards this enterprise, whioh it considers to be too autocratic in methods.

GERMANY

The Centre or Catholic Party appears to be making an effort to revive interest in the question of the secession of the Rhineland, but although there is a certain feeling in favour of separation and considerable disatisfaction with the Government, which is said to neglect the occupied region, no active measures are, being taken to organize a plan of campaign.

The German Communist Party, which appears to be steadily growing, has established a Central office in Berlin, with working branches in the Federal States and Provinces. There is evidence that the Party is now working in conjunction with the Independent Socialists and, at the same time, keeping in close touoh with the various civil, military and naval extremists, both at home and abroad. The Government, however, which can count upon the support of the regular troops, who now number about 400,000, seems able to control the situation for the present, and on the 22nd of August directed the Military Authorities to occupy the building used as the headquarters of the Independent Social Democrats and Communists, whose Executive Council had ordered new elections to be held for the Berlin Workers&apos; Councils. The Executive Council was forbidden to prepare for these elections or further to use the building.

The situation as regards Bolshevism is likely to become critical during the late Autumn, chiefly owing to the lack of coal and raw materials. A member of the Government expected a Spartacist rising in October, and said that the Spartacists had field guns and other arms ooncealed. Food does not appear to be scarce, but lack of proper control is inflicting serious hardship on the poorer classes. The prices of articles of clothing are still exceedingly high.

The Indepen are rather looked up to     the working classes, who oona them as the one strong party which Has not yet been giv trial.  The older workmen, however, and the skilled labourers are still inolined to adhere to the majority Sooialist Barty.The fall of the Hungarian Soviet Government has gr eased the situation in Austria. The spread of Bolsheviv has boon arrested on account of its failure in Buda Pest and also owing to the stoppage of financial support froal that source. The Communist Party in Austria still oontin to hold meetings, but it is not considered that the move is gaining ground.It is doubtful whether any of the new States formed out of the Austrian Empire will be self-supporting, and everything points therefore to an economic alliance bod Austria and Germany and between Germany and Caeoho-31ov&amp;. The policy of a direot union between Austria and Germany not realJy popular In Austria, but the Sooialist Party In now mads this policy a principal plank in its platform, mainly because its leaders foresaw that what was called the &quot;Danube Federation&quot; would never be socialistic.Oensral opinion oonoeming the financial situation is vary psssimlstio, whether expressed in the newspaper!or/
or by qualified Individuals.www I   11:Tho situation is still obsoure,   Monarchist feeling is said to be strong among the peasants, who are longing for tho rule of a strong man.    The Christian Socialists are anxious to retain Sriedrioh.   The Railwaymen and Post Offioe offioials have left the Socialist democratic Party for the Christian aooialists.  This reduces the Socialist strength, previously estimated at 16 per cent of the whole -electorate, to about 10 per cent;  It is stated that the peasants and agrarians regard the Archduke as the symbol of a Christian Hungary, and there is oertainly a strong ;   religious revival at the moment.In spite of their internment, Beia iCun, Kunfi and JJandler are reported to be keeping in touoh with their agents in Vienna and Buda Pesth.   Bela Kun evidently still hopes to regain power in Hungary and has already requested Lenin to give him financial support,It is now officially confirmed by the Vienna Polioe that Tibor Szamuely committed suioide when arrested by the Frontier guards on August 1st.   Aooording to his own statement he was proceeding to Vienna in order to start a Soviet Republic in German-Austria on August 5th.   138,000 kronen in bank notes were found in the pocket of his overcoat,Signor Kitti has obtained a good deal of evidence of the connection between JSxtremists in Italy and *theiBolsheviks in Russia and Hungary.   As soon as this evidence is oompiete he intends to arrest the ringleaders.   The Italian polioe, on the other hand, do not appear to have any systematic plan for dealing with the Bolshevik menace,and/
and these Socialists, who openly advocate Bolshevism, are taking full advantage of the polioe ineffioienoy to undermine the morale of the Army and to spread their propaganda throughout the country.There is evidenoe to show that Italy is working for a renewed alliance with Germany and German Austria.   At the same time the polioy of the Government appears to be less insistent upon the Italian olaims in Dalmatia, and the Prime Minister has emphasised the neoessity for olearing up the political situation at home if further assistance from the Allies is to be obtained.The industrial situation in the country is still unsettled.  Every class of labour is demanding higher pay and resort is made to strikes on the slightest provocation labour organisations appear to be well provided with funds, but little of the money is believed to come from foreign souroes.   It is probable, therefore, that money has been saved by the strikers during the war and that the strikes are of an eoonomio rather than a revolutionary charaoter. In spite of this, however, it should be noted that a special decree has been issued ordering that particulars concerning any firearms or explosives in the possession, of individuals should be made to the polioe,   The ostensi^j motive for this deoree is to guard against accidents trw war rel^os, but in reality it is to prevent the hiding of explosives and weapons which might be used for revolutioi purposes.The Committee of Union and Progress is now oonsidw by many Moslems as the sole ohampicn of the principles whioh Turks hold as sacred.  Agents of the Committee *r*endeavour^
endeavouring to stir up the masses at home and are aoting ay agents for Lenin in Asia and India.   It is reported that Bolshevik agents and large&quot; sums of money are passing froni the Ukraine into Turkey.   The Young Turks appear to be represented in Switzerland and are engaged in active propaganda work against Great Britain, in which they are reoeiving some Rrenoh and German support,The relations between the Committee of Union and progress and the Egyptian Nationalists appear to have been re-established, and a Mohammedan Association, whioh is to have branches in many Mohammedan countries, is being organised on the principles Of the Committee of Union and Progress.   The leaders of this movement have already reoeived promises of support from Arab tribes and from Mesopotamia.Further rumours have been reoeived to the effect that Enver is in Turkestan, where he is awaiting the development of the Bolshevik offensive on the Orenburg front.  He is said to be at the head ef an Army of 200,000, which he intends to use for a oombined offensive with the Bolsheviks on Bokhara and Afghanistan,    1The Turkish Red Cresoent Society, under the oloak of assisting prisoners of war, has beoome a centre for pan-Islamic propaganda, and is suspeoted of being oonrieoted with the revolutionary movement in Egypt.  The Sooiety .is also working to effeot an organised resistance to the Greek enoroaohments in IPurkey.   Leaflets of a pan-Islamic nature, printed in Arabio and Persian, have reoently been obtained in Constantinople.   Both leaflets are stirring appeals to.Moslems.   It appears probable that they were printed by the Shems Press in Stamboul, and the author is believed to be Syed Ivtuhaamed Tewfik, a Persianjournalist/
journalist, who is now Chief Chamberlain to the ex-Shah of Persia.All the Turks in Switzerland, with the exoeption of a very snail number who are francophile, agree that the best polioy from a Turkish point of view is to support the British 4.  Mandate.   At the same time- they are continuing their activities in favour of a Pan Islamic.League, which they would not hesitate to use against England should she refuse, or be unabls to aooept, the Mandate over Turkey,The viotory of the Prime Minister&apos;s party - whioh is sal to possess the most intellectual and capable politicians in tii oountry - at the reoent general elections in Sofia was reoeiw with great joy.The leaflets distributed during the eleotion period by the Narrow Socialists (the Left Wing Party) contained the injunotion &quot;Vote for Bolshevism as the surest way of getting food and work&quot;.Though this party have always sympathized with Bolshevl this is the first time that their actual identifioation with the Bolsheviks has been avowed.There are indications that the Slovenes and Croats are tired of the Serbian administration..   It is reported that t* former have practically oeased to take orders from Belgrade and that the latter are on the brink of open revolt.pZBCHO-SLOVAKIAIt is reported that there is an organisation for toritfBolshevik funds to Prague from Buda Pesth and Buoharest.headquarter
headquarters of this organisation, which is directed by Denes and Sazvarg, two Bolshevik agents, is at Karlsbad.  Jancusek, a Czech Bolshevik, who was formerly in touch with Bela Kun, is now reported to be in Prague,Reports from Various souroes indicate that negotiations are pleading between members of the Soviet Government and the representatives of Sooialist parties in Russia;   It is stated that Lunaoharaky has been sent by Lenin to  petrograd for this purpose,   there is also a rumour in Sweden that Lenin, who has been considerably disoouraged by the failure of Soviet Government in Hungary, proposes to hand over tne Government to the Menshevika, his idea being to shew that no other party oan evolve any more order out of the chaos in Russia than the Bolsheviks.  On the other hand, it is reported that the extreme Red section of the Bolsheviks, under Peters and Derslhsk^, is gaining the upper hand, that Lenin&apos;s influence haai obnsiderablir decreased and that a fresh Reign of Terror may be antioipated.: &apos;In reply to questions as to his present polioy, Lenin is reported to have said that his programme is to free the world from the yoke of capitalism, and from this he will1 never depart; to give all possible help to Afghanistan, India, and other Mohammedan oountries in their fi&amp;t for independencej with &apos; regard to America and Japan, t6cobmbat i-theiir-criminal, shameless and brigandlike attaok on us&quot;.

no   14   *&quot; &quot;will develop in Russia, it is fairly evident that the existlt Oovemment, whioh is becoming increasingly more unpopular, wi] not, last much longer - at any rate in its present form,, Meanv&amp;lle, however, the Bolsheviks are making vigorous I efforts to inoreace their Army and are said to be mobilising L the Tartar population of the Astrakhan distriot in rear of   I General Denikin*s army.   Their offensive operations on the   1 Orenburg front are also making good progress. IThere is no doubt that the polioy of the Entente in Buses 1b having a bad effect unon their Russian supporters, and alstl ,    upon the Finns.   The delay in the Military operations against I Petrograd is strengthening the feeling against Great BritainJ and it is urged that the proposed withdrawal from Ar oh angel I would irrevocably destroy British influenoe in Russia.

His literary works have a wide circulation.Large sums of money are being spent by the Bolsheviks on the work of propaganda in Finland and Siberia, and it is also reported that the Government is spending money on propaganda to oombat the religious revival in Bolshevik Russia.:   There appears to be a strong religious Reeling in Siberia and in this,connection an anti^Bolshevik religious order has reoently been formed at Omsk, called the Order of St. Hermogenes. &quot;The Old Believers throughout Siberia are to be invited to join this Order with the object of raising detachments to figit the Bolsheviks.

In Mosoow it is reported that the bread ration, which has been still further reduced, is now only distributed orioe in ten days. Mosoow appears to be mainly dependent, as regards wireless servloes^on. Tashkent for its news of the&apos; Eastern world, but the servioe is bad and news is usually delayed several weeks.   The financial position of the Soviet Government is growing steadily worse, the budget for the first half of the year 1919 having -been closed;with a deficit of 30.3 milliard roubles.   The 1 minimum.wage; in Soviet Russia,beginning on the 16th of August, was fixed at 1200 roubles a month; the maximum at - 4800 roubles a month1;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;     is feiforeign)
of the Poles.  On the other hand there is evidence that the Polish Communist Workmen&apos;s Party is suffering from lack of funds.The Russian portion of Poland, on aooount of its larger industrial population, is more susceptible to Bolshevik influence than the rest of the oountry.   In Lodz, where Warski, the titular leader of the movement,- is&apos; said to be in hiding, the Bolshevik propaganda increases daily.   It is largely supported by Germans. In Posen the Bolsheviks appear to have been less Successful and attempts whioh ware made to seduce the troops failed.   In Cracow and Lemberg also the Nationalist feeling has been strong enough to resist Bolshevik influences.   The Agrarian polioy of the Government seenis to have given more satisfaction to the oountry population than was at first anticipated, and, if the eoonomio conditions Improve, it is improbable that Bolshevism will reoeive any considerable measure of support outside the large industrial oentres.BAl/TIC PROVINCESIt is reported that the German organisation for recruiting volunteers for service in the Baltic provinoes has been re-oonstruoted under the title of the &quot;Society for the protection of Germans in Foreign Countries and Borderlands.&quot;FINLAND&quot;    !-Aithou^ the;eteo^ion of Stahlberg in plaoe of liannerheim has seriously affected the military policy or againfSoviet Russia, it has undoubtedly smoothed the internal situation:Stahlberg is a supporter of the Entente and a determined opponent of Germany, but it seems probable that the radical nature of his supporters will prevent him from giving military \ aid in the oapture at Petrograd.

Pamphlets have recently been distributedlat Helsin^for stating that a great Socialist World Revolution is imminent and urging the sailors to put forward a demand to be sent home, to introduce the new Era of Liberty arid to inaugurate Sailors * Counoils whioh should take charge-of the revolutionary movement in England.The prevailing opinion among qualified judges in Norway is that BolshevlBm is on the wane and that the fear of an attempted revolution Is decreasing.   The Government has taken elaborate precautions to ensure the suppression of any rising. !

The Swedish Pressalso/
also shows a tendency to support this proposal.It is not considered likely that the Swedes will create a revolution on their own initiative, but If the Finns and Norwegians were to adopt Bolshevik principles they would probably follow their example.      :HadjetlaohJ. alias Hadjani, who has undoubtedly been in the pay of the Bolsheviks, has oonfessed to having murdered Dr Ardaohev, the Russian&apos; Bolshevik&apos; agent, Calve, the Commercial attache at the Bolshevik legation, and bevltsky, a wealthy journalist and Bolshevik agent.   These murders were at first supposed to have been perpetrated by an alleged antl-Bolshevl] gang and created considerable excitement in political circles j in Sweden.   The motive for the murders, however, appears to have been pecuniary, as large sums of money were in the possession of the murdered men.Strikes, though frequent, have not usually been of long ^ or less   oomplevictory for the omployees. The serious factor.in the oituati however/appears to be that responsible leaders of the Trade Unions, who had resolutely opposed the, excessive demands oft Syndicalist section, now appear to have changed their eoonoml policy and to make demands coupled with threats which neither the employers nor the State will be in a position to meet, the other tf&amp;idy &apos;S^dioaliBm^inwpenma^^s;.npt indigenous and the great mass of the working class population is quite unaffected by the Syndicalist propaganda from abroad, line b* protection against Syndicalism, so far, has been the exoellei organisation (both of employers and employed, and the reoognii &apos;  regulation of the relat ionship. between all olasses,The/
The &quot;Klassekampen&quot;, the Bolshevik propaganda newspaper, has oeased to appear because it failed to obtain eoonomio support . from Danish working men.A powerful Jewish 3ociety, whioh is supporting Kerensky, is said to exist In Copenhagen.   Czamansky, who Is the leader of this organisation, is apparently also head of the Russian Red Cross in Denmark.   The polidy of this Society is to support the Russian Revolution in the hope that a reaction will set in, when it is anticipated that it will be possible for Kerensky&apos;s party to take; over the power.Herr Fredrik Strom, formerly leader of the Ultra-Sooialist Party in the First Chamber, has suooeeded in getting elected as rspresentative for iiulea, having been previously defeated at Stockholm and in the province of Koprarberg.   Strom was instrumental in sending Zaoharie/ssen to England with funds for Sylvia Pankhurst.There appears to be good evldenoe that the Syndicalist party are in negotiation with Germans for the purohase of arms on behalf of the Syndicalists in Norway and Sweden.  The transaction is at present held up owing to laok of funds.&apos;There has been little open Communist agitation in Holland. Small strikes continue to occur and probably the Communists are responsible for much of the labour unrest, their objeot being to exploit the existing ebonomio difficulties to their own advantage. The Dutch Authorities oonsider that Troelstra is one of the most dangerous, men in Holland at the present time.  He has a large following of Socialists with moderate views who would, undoubtedly follow him should he suddenly adopt Communist sympathies.Ytyiikpop!s popularity is said to have diminished owing to his laok of energy end pro-Entente tendencies.
The Communists have apparently organised a system of guides for getting their agents across the frontier,and the polioe are now obliged to rely entirely upon registration and upon disoover. ing oouriers after their arrival in the country.   Wie (JommunistB are also endeavouring to enrol their agents in the polioe force, Some of their number have already been discovered in the Burgerwaoht, which is aforoe raised by the citizens for the defence of public buildings and private property.The Hague Town ^Council has voted a subsidy of 10,000 florins ( 800) to the Hague Burgerwaoht in spite of the strong opposition of the Socialists.  Hitherto this subsidy has only been opposed by the Communists.The polioe force in Holland on the whole is considered to J be reliable, in spite of the fact that a Polioe Union has recently been formed. 1The Dutch Non-Commissioned Officers Union has held several I meetings in Amsterdam and other towns in order to protest against the scale of pay.   In some oases, officers have taken part in these meetings. : The Minister for War has, however, refused to grant the N.C,0&apos;s demands.A newspaper called &quot;The Word&quot;, part of whloh is printed in English and so presumably is intended for British soldiers stationed in Holland, has recently appeared.   It contains a     I clever combination of Sooialist and German propaganda.   One of j its editors is Rudolf W. G. Breithaupt, who is working at the I German Legation at the,Hague.

On the other hand, there IS a considerable amount Of unostentatious work being done by certain educated and dangerous propagandists whose work is generally considered to be more pemiolous than that of the loud voioed illiterate demonstrators.: The Seamen&apos;s strike, which has lasted fourteen weeks and entailed a loss of  3,500,000, oame to an end on August 25th.

All lines of commerce shew an Increased &quot; aotivitj and the outlook generally is regarded more hopefully.Further, information with regard to the reoent negro riots , at Washington and Chicago tends to prove that / although Garvey and^ialey, at Washington and the Irish leaders at Chicago did their best to instil a spirit of discontent among&apos; thenegroes, the&apos;main causes for the disturbances at both places were economic, due, to a great extent, to the employment of no -Union negroes from the South to do the work of white men who hj gone to the war.It is also reported that Japanese agents have been behind] . .   the coloured disturbances in America.   This may be due to the .faot that t^e negroes are demanding the inclusion of&apos;the&apos;yell^ -races in their world-wide olaims for social and political equality with the white races.

On&apos; the other hand, a strong movement is afoot to obtain the nationalisation of the American Railways and mines&apos;by direot action.In spite of high wages there is wide-spread discontent, which is explained by the fact that workmen generally are spending their increase of wages on luxuries and they feel the pinch when it comes to buying the necessaries of life at their present prioes.
