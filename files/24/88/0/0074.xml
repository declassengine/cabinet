MEMORANDUM BY THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER PASSENGER ACCOMMODATION FOR CIVILIANS.The attention of the War Cabinet is invited to the present difficulties experienced by business men and other civilians in obtaining passages to places abroad consequent on the very heavy demands made by the Army on the available passenger space on various trade routes. ,The situation is easing in-certain directions, notably South Africa, where it is anticipated Government demands will be small after the end of September and also on the North Atlantic and to South America.   On the Australian route a definite proportion of the accommodation on many ships has been placed at the disposal of the Shipping Companies and a similar arrangement will be possible on the New Zealand route on the ships sailing after the end of September. -The position on the route to. India and the Far East is however, that all passenger accommodation has been requisitioned up to the.end of October and although after that date it may.be possible to afford some slight relief by diverting a number of German ships to that route, the position will be that very little accommodation will be available for ordinary passenger purposes^during the forth-coming passenger season.   This, In view of the fact that one Company alone has over 12,000 passengers waiting for India aid the East, is a serious situation.The War Office maximum demands to India and the East arestated to be 50,000 troops between the middle of July and the end ofOctober and a further 50,000 between the end. of October and the end ofFebruary.   While the actual conveyance of the troops does not so seriously Interfere with the passenger traffic, the number of officersaccompanying them, when added to the very large number of officersgoing on or returning from leave, and Indian and Colonial officialswaiting conveyance, is such that the whole:of the passenger accorano-dation in prospect is required for Government purposes, and, even thenno/
th September, 1919.no provision is made for the conveyance of families of the-m11 itary officers who, under the regulations   are entitled to have their families carried to India at &quot;Government expense.The Shipping Controller requests that a drastic reduction be made in the number of Military to go out within the next six months or in any case that a large number be deferred.
