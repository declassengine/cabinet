&apos; i B : If&apos; /^AERONAUTICAL RrSHARCH.1, Theipresent po a1tjon.At the present time Aeronautical Rese$$ch is in the hands of four different departments as follows(a) The Technical Department of the Air Group of the Ministry of Munitions, now called the Directorate of Research, is responsible for all research and experimental work connecter! with aeroplanes, seaplanes, aero-engines, instruments, and armament.    Thin work is carried out either at Headquarters in London or at one of the experimental stations - R.A.D. Farnborough, Martlesham Heath, Grain, Felixstowe, and Orfortiness.   By arrangement with the Air Ministry, the directorate has taken over responsibility for Wireless Telegraphy, photography and Kite Balloon experimental and research work.    The wireless telegraphy work is carried out at Biggin Hill, and the kite balloon and photography have in the past been carried out at Roehampton and Kenley;- the future position of these experimental stations is not yet settlen.,(b) Research and experimental work connected with Airships has been carried out in the past by the Admiralty at a number of stations.    The transfer of this work to the Air Ministry is in process. - -(o)    Certain experimental work connected with Aeronautics is being carried out at the National physical Laboratory which is under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.(d)    Meteorological work is mainly in the hands of the Meteorological Office, but the Admiralty, War Office an3 Air Ministry all have branches of their own.    The transfer of the whole of this work to the Air Ministry under a decision of the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet is now ni process of being effected. &apos;,The only machinery at present provided for co-ordinating this work is the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.   Lord Raylelgh was appointed president of this Committee by the prime Minister In 1908, and held this position until he died quite recently.    This Comnittee has done excellent work.   It is clear, however, that the present position is not a satisfactory one, and that the research work should be properly organised by the transfer of all responsibility to some one central department.2* Committee on Aeronautical Education and Research.The whole subject has recently been examined by a Committee appointed by Lord &apos;*feir in October 1918 and presided over by Sir   H.T.Glazebrook and their main conclusions may be summarised as follows(a)    A Board of Aeronautical Research to be constituted in connection with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.    This Board to be composed of representatives of Government Departments, the Air industry and the Imperial College of Science and Technology as well as other members of Scientific attainments.   Non-official members to be paid. Its main functions to be as follows
.* 2 -(i)   ,To assist Government Departments and the ^troraft Industry of the Country toy scientific advice and research.(iij To be responsible for- all research and experiments carried out in Government institutions, the researc department of the R.A.E. at Farnborough to be trans ferred to the Boardfbr this purpose, and facilities for research work on seaplanes and: airships to be provided elsewhere by Government departments.(iii)   To promote aeronautical education.(lv)   To prepare estimates and administer funds placed fit Its disposal by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.(b) An inter-departmental Council for Aeronautics to be established consisting of high officials of departments concerned with aeronautical policy and independent men of science.   The function of this Council to be to advise the Minister in charge of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in regard to financial proposals of the Board of Aeronautical Research.(c) Direct representation of aeronautics on the existing Advisory Council for Scientific and -Industrial Research under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.(d) A Department of Aeronautics to be established in the Imperial college for the provision of advanced instruction in aeronautics anr! for research work.   This to be the only Government-aided school of Aeronautics and officers in charge of researches at R.A.E. and elsewhere to hold positions on the teaching staff.Details of the schemeto be settled in consultation with the Board of Aeronautical Research, when appointed as proposed. The present Advisory Committee for Aeronautics would disappear.3. Air Ministry proposals.As regards 2 (a), I dissent from the view of the committ that the financial control of aeronautical research should be vest in the Department of Scientific ana&quot; industrial Research.    The responsibility of the Air rintstry for this work has already recei the sanction of Parliament, a large sum being included in the Air Estimates for research, and I do not understand that the oreat of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was intend to relieve other departments of state of such special responsibility-ibilitles as that which attaches to the Air Ministry for research of a purely aeronautical charaoter.The purpose of the Department of Scientific and Industrt Research, is, as I conceivej rather to undertake the larger and more general problems of research where no immediate practical result is expected and generally to assist and inspire the work of departments whose work has a technical side.   The Air Ministry prepared and anxious to enlist the help of the Department, but cannot transfer to it a responsibility which is and must be peculiarly its own.    Such help would be peculiarly valuable in tl application of the experience of other sciences and industries to aeronautical problems.
29 r idThe reasons for which the Obinmiiteo recommended the transfer of the responsibility to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research are given in paragraphs 42 - 44 of the report, a cony Of which is appended to this&apos; memorandum.   But these reasons are not 1 think well founded.   Theyo^jected to control by the Air Ministry qua military department on the ground that control should be civilian in character,and they objected to control by the Department of Civil Aviation on the $round that research facilities should not be. subordinated to that Department of State which exercises a controlling or regulating authority over the industry.    Under the new organisation of the Air Ministry, however, research will be entirely independent both of the department of the Chief of tho Air Staff and of the Department of&apos;Civil Aviation, the proposal beinft to organise a special department of the Air Ministry to be called the Department of Supply and Research.As I conceive the situation, the essential tiling at the oresent stage of aeronautical development is to concentrate in one Ministry the handling of all factors on which success of failure in securing progress depends.   This consideration is&apos;the basis of the agreement as to the method of supply of aircraft arrived at between the Air Ministry and the.Ministry of Supply which is now   ^ awaiting ratification by the prime Binistef.   It is also the basis for the transfer of airships now being wade between the Air Ministry and the Admiralty.    The consideration applies with as much force to aeronautical research as to aeronautical supply.   One of the greatest factors in the striking process of aeronautical research during the war has been the constant and close touch maintained with actual flying through the subordination of what was the central department for research,&quot; vis. the Technical Department, at one time in name,vand always in fact if not in name to the Ministry controlling the use of aircraft.   Any&quot; Step **Mch removes research further a/ay from that Ministry is a retrograde step.Insistence on this essential principle in no way implies that full weight is not given to the relation of aeronautical research to the other branches of research.   The closest touch must be maintained with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the utmost use made of its assistance    The Air Ministry is fully prepared to see that this is done ard to request the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to investigate from time to time problems for the solution of which a knowledge ande xperience of other departments of State, or public or private research institutions will be required.   The precise relation between the Air Ministry.and tte Department of Scientific and Industrial Research can readily be worked out in practice and need not at the outset be defined in detail.I am accordingly of the opinion that the proposed Research Department of the Air Ministry should be entrusted with all aeronautical research work and with the Departmental control of all funds provided for the purpose by the State, except that it may be convenient in the case of the National physical Laboratory that the funds found to he  required for aeronautical research work there should continue to be borne on the votes of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the amount being adjusted with reference to tbe total Air Ministry provision.   If my view is the correct one, it follows that the state should give no financial assistance to such a research association formed by the Aeronaxitical Industry, in connection with th^ Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, aa has been in contemplation, since such an association can only produce practical resulta if it
.* 4 mprovides establishments where practical experiments can be carried out, thus duplicating the experimental establishments of the Air Ministry.    It is obvious that this duplication would be uneconomical and that such money as the State is prepared to provide for aeronautical researoft work should be placed in the han of one department which can ensure that there is no overlapping or duplication of effort.In substitution for the proposals of the Olazebrook Committee, and as a means of fully meeting their objections to control by the Air Ministry, and also of satisfying the legitimate demands of the aircraft industry, I propose that a committee should bo constituted by the Air Council consisting of official representatives, scientific men, and representatives of the aeronautical industry.,   This Committeenti.ll take the place of the present Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, but I propose that it should not only advise the Air Ministry on such matters aa are put to it, but that it should be given the executive control of certain portions of the&apos; research and experimental work undertaken by the Air Ministry and should have the power to initiate within certain limits research which in its opinion should be under-taken in the interests of aeronautical progress.    It seems to me that without some such executive functions the committee will be a; to lose   interest in its work and the full results will not be secured.If the above is agreed to, there is no necessity to appol an inter-departmenttti Council for Aeronautics to advise on &apos; financial proposals, nor is there any necessity for an aeronautical representative to be appointed to the Advisory council of the Depaf ment of Scientific and Industrial Research.    The appointment of Air Ministry representatives as assessors to the council, which is now being carried out, will be sufficient to ensure that the Air Ministry&quot;and the Department of scientific and Industrial Research! kept generally in touch with work being carried out by the two departments.   If this result is found in practice to be insufficient secured the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research can m doubt be represented on the Committee above proposed.A further point in the&apos; report of the Glazebrook  Oommitti to which I draw attention is the recommendation that a monopoly of research facilities should be given to the Imperial College. Adequate instruction in the science of aeronautics cannot be given at any University or other educational establishment.unless facilities for research work are provided, and professorial person! of adequate attainments is forthcoming.    At the moment: the Imperil College is, perhaps, the best equipped as regards research in aeronautics, but a Chair of Aeronautics has recently been endowed i Cambridge, and it is not Improbable that! similar action will be til at Oxford in the near future.   If this were done, there is no reasi , to think that either of these University could not afford the satf facilities as the Imperial college, while to some w^s they would have advantages over London with regard to actual flying. Arrangements are being made for an R.A.F. Flight to be stationed a an aerodrome near Cambridge., and,, should a Chair of Aeronautics be established at Oxford, -it is prpbable that, similar arrangements could be made there. ,It is probably advantageous to have several centres of researoh, in order fto&apos; ensure that the problems may be examined frfl different points of view, and that one method of investigation may not be stereotyped,&apos; as might; well happen if re search: were concent at a single University,. The estimate of cost, suggested on p.a$ of the Glajsebrook Committee, would probably.!have to;.be.,increased.; slightly as a total, but it is not suggested that the figure confer as a contribution to the Imperial College as the sole centre of rese^
23 for aeronautics, should be given to that or any other one institution if research is established at other Universities as well.4. Summary.To sum up my conclusions, I recommend the following(a) The Air Council alone should be responsible for all research and experimental work undertaken for the development of aeronautics with money provided by the Government (with the exception of such research work as forms the necessary partof education in the science of aeronautics.)(b) That the Government should give no financial assistance to any research association formed by the industry.   In order that the industry should be able to influence the course which research and experimental work takes, and to ensure that the military aspects of aviation are not over-emphasised to the detriment of the de\$.opment of civil or commercial aviation, I propose that the Air Council should reconstitute the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and should give aerate representation on it tothe industry.   To this Oonmittets the Air council should assign the executive control of certain portions of the research and experimental work undertaken by the Air Ministry.(c) Since the proper teaching of the science of aeronautics at universities requires the provision of suitable personnel and adequate facilities for research work, while the number of men capable of giving instruction is at present so limited that a complete teaching staff for more than one university may notbe immediately forthcoming, and the facilities for research work can only be provided at a considerable cost which no university is in a position to meet without a large subsidy from the Government, the bulk of the money assistance for the study of aeronautics granted by the State should, on account of the foundation of the Eaharoff Chair of Aviation at the Imperial College, be given to London University, while at the same time assistance in tho form of smaller grants or in other ways should be given to those universities which from time to time may ondow chairs of aeronautics. -Appended to this memorandum are (1) a cop^r of the Glazebrook Report (2) a copy of a letter from t^e University of London pressing for an early decision on the questions raised, in order that the Zaharoff Professorship may be filled.I would urge that the matter be dealt with at tho earliest possible date.9th September, 1919.(Intld.)

CONFIDENTIAL.COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND RESEARCH INAERONAUTICS.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE.To the Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill, M.P., Secretary of State for Air.]. The Committee on Education and. Research in Aeronautics was appointed by Lord Weir of Eastwood in October 1918 under the following terms of reference : To consider what steps should now be taken to organise education and research in aeronautics after the war and to report.The Committee should have regard to the agencies which already exist for this purpose or which it is proposed to establish, and in particular the relationship of the Zaharoff Professorship to such agencies.INTRODUCTION.2. We think it may be useful by way of an introduction to this Report to summarise both the problem as it appears to us and the general conclusions we have reached; the reasons on which these are based will be found in the body of the report while our definite recommendations are given at the end.3. Education and research are clearly very closely interrelated. The education with which we have chiefly concerned ourselves is that suitable for Aeronautical Engineers and Constructors, that is to say, post-graduate work for which the students will be fitted by a previous undergraduate course of either mechanical or general engineering training at one of the Universities or Technical Colleges. We have not dealt with the training of pilots or of mechanics. The course we contemplate will comprise a special study of the following matters : Aerodynamics-the laws of motion of bodies moving in the air, illustrated by experiments and researches in wind channels ; the principles of design and construction; engines and the methods of propulsion of aircraft; the investigation of instruments used in flight, with problems in Meteorology and Navigation. The engineer must also gain the practical knowledge acquired only in the workshop and must have experience of the full scale researches necessary to test and verify his theoretical conclusions. Such a course might eventually involve one or more centres of theoretical instruction with experimental aerodromes and laboratories where the full scale problems maybe worked out, but as the number of persons likely to require this higher post-graduate education will not be great, we consider that it will be wise for the present to concentrate the work in one central institution with which the experimental aerodromes should be closely connected. Such a central institution we find in the Imperial College of Science and Technology at which the Professorship lately founded by Sir Basil Zaharoff, G.B.E., is to be held.4. Turning now to Research : this is the means by which advance in Aeronautics is possible and it is required by all interested in the progress of the subject; by the State whether for the purposes of defence or to enable it to lay down the rules necessary for the safety of aircraft when used for civil purposes; by the Professor whose aim is to increase knowledge, and by the Industry in order that they may maintain the superiority which British aircraft has already achieved. Research is difficult, its requirements are costly, and the men who can undertake it are few. To establish separate research laboratories and aerodromes for each of these special interests is for the moment out of the question; here again combination is called, for; combination too with the agencies- concerned in education. At the same time we recognise fully that special problems may be dealt with at other research centres, and we trust that every encouragement may be given to these for such work.5. Since the commencement of practical aeronautics, research has been directed by the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, a body under the presidency of Lord Rayleigh appointed by the Prime Minister in the year 1908 &quot; for the superintendence &quot; of the investigations at the National Physical Laboratory and for general advice on &quot; the scientific problems arising in connection with the work of the Admiralty and &quot; War Office in aerial construction and navigation.&quot;o   [18.3.19]  (33) 7806 (7623)  Pk 0104  (F 314)  125  4/19  e&amp;SA
6. Full scale researck has been carried out at Farnborougb in part at the initiation of the Committee, in part at that o  the military authorities ; the Committee, however, have no control over the work there and-only occupy&quot;an advisory position with regard to it. During the war, other centres of full scale research have. developed, e.g., the Isle of Grain and Felixstowe for Seaplanes, Kingsnorth and Pulbam for Airships, and the Advisory Committee has been kept in close touch with the work in progress at all of these. Its activities have been of the greatest value. In our view a central co-ordinating body of this kind is essential, and we propose the establishment of a Board of Aeronautical Research to which the duties of the Committee would be transferred, and to which would be added certain duties and responsibilities with regard both to the central research aerodromes and to education.7. This Board should be fully representative of all the bodies concerned in the promotion of Aeronautics and in particular of the industry. Full scale research must, as in the immediate past, continue to be carried out in various centres, and it is necessary to consider the connection of the Board, with these.By far the greater part of this work could be done at Farnborough, and in our view control of this should rest with the Board, which should become responsible  acting probably through a Sub-Committee with Executive powers for the direction and management of the Farnborough Research Establishment.In the case of the Seaplane and Airship Stations it would probably he -sufficient, for the moment, to maintain the present arrangements, placing the Board in an advisory capacity.At present Farnborough is under the Ministry of Munitions and is maintained from funds for which the Minister accounts to Parliament. The experimental portion of the station is according to our scheme to become a Research Institution for the benefit of Aeronautical Science in all its aspects, military and civil, including in the latter, education.8. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research has recently been set up as the Department responsible to Parliament for the expenditure of funds devoted to research; the expenditure on the Aeronautical work at the National Physical Laboratory, which will be under the superintendence of the proposed Research Board, already forms part of the Budget of that Department, and we have come to the conclusion that the cost of the Research Institution at Farnborough should also fall on the Department. At the same time we call special attention to the need for great elasticity in the administration of the funds available for research.9. In order to connect the Board with the educational work and to render the opportunities of research at Farnborough and elsewhere available both to teachers and to students we suggest that arrangements should he made between the Board and the Imperial College for dealing with matters with which they are jointly concerned. In this connection, moreover, we suggest that it would be possible in a number of cases for members of the Research Staff to act as Professors or Lecturers at the College.The scheme outlined above, which we proceed to develop more completely, agrees in the main with that put forward in the Reports of the Civil Aerial Transport Committee (Cd. 9218) and described in the reports of Special Committee No. 5, and we consider that it may be possible through the organisation outlined to link up the advanced teaching in aeronautics wherever given. It is in our opinion highly desirable and indeed essential that any teaching connected with aeronautics which may be given elsewhere should be related and co-ordinated with this organisation.We would add that the reports of Special Committee No. 5 of Civil Aerial Transport Committee have been of the greatest value to us.EDUCATION IN AERONAUTICS.10. Education in Aeronautics in its widest sense might be held to cover not only the education of the scientifically-trained engineer, designer, or constructor, but also that of the mechanic or artisan. We have not, however, thought that the education of the latter class fell within our terms of reference. It will in the main be provided by the formation of special classes at the principaltechnical schools, more especially at those situated in the neighbourhood of important works or aerodromes.
11. The problem of the organisation of education in aeronautics as it has presented itself to us has been that of higher education, which can only be given in institutions of university rank.The subject matter of this higher education comprises instruction in I. Aerodynamics,(a) Aeroplanes(b) Seaplanes V Full scale and model work. . (c) Airships and Kite Balloons )   ,II. Engines and the means of propulsion.III. Principles of Design.   Structure and Material.IV, Instruments, Meteorology, and Navigation.12. We consider that an undergraduate course in engineering such as is commonly provided at Universities and at the great Technical Schools forms the necessary preparation to any more specialised courses of instruction.The advent of aeronautics will doubtless to some extent be reflected in the curricula of existing undergraduate courses. Just as at present the education of a mechanical engineer is incomplete without some general knowledge of electrical engineering, so in future all engineers should have at least a superficial knowledge of aeronautical engineering. For the civil engineer it will, for example, offer some instructive instances in the study of structural design while some reference to aeronautical engines will necessarily form part of any mechanical engineering course. Existing courses do not, however, provide for the specialised training which is needed for those who are to direct aeronautical research, and the design and construction of aircraft. It is clear that the provision of such training is of vital importance to the future of aeronautics whether viewed from the industrial and civil standpoint or from the point of view of defence.13. The organisation of this higher training requires in our view the provision -(a) of courses for men who have attained the highest standards of universitytraining at the various engineering schools ;(b) of courses based on a sound general engineering training but not involvingtoo high a standard of mathematical knowledge for men of special practical ability.The first class is represented by honours graduates, i.c, by the pick of those who have passed through undergraduate courses.We contemplate that the period of special theoretical training should not exceed 12 months, distributed as might be convenient over the ordinary period required for practical training.During the period of post-graduate instruction the student should also obtain some air experience. We have not, however, thought it within the scope of our inquiry to deal with the question of the provision of instruction in flying, though it is, we think, important that it should be recognised as a desirable part of the technical equipment of the designer and constructor.We have not thought it necessary to work out in detail the curricula of the higher education nor to discuss the administrative arrangements which will be required to provide for the division of the student&apos;s time between the lecture courses and the practical work in research stations or in the shops.14. It is undesirable that promising students of small means should be deterred from higher education in aeronautics by the expense which a prolonged period of training involves. - An adequate system of maintenance scholarships should be established. This might be supplemented by the payment of small salaries in respect of periods passed in the research establishments or in aircraft works.Organisation of the Higher Education in Aeronautics.15. The specialised or post-graduate training of the kind which has been described in the previous paragraphs should in our view be organised on an entirely different basis from the undergraduate training. The latter as we have shown can and should be provided in existing organisations of University rank in various parts of the country. Post-graduate training, however, to be complete, requires access to aerodromes and to research stations fitted with technical equipment, and it would be, wre think, impracticable under present conditions to try to provide completely for this highly specialised training at more than one centre.A 2
.. : The financial saving through the avoidance of duplication of research and other facilities necessary to the higher grades of education is obvious. It is also relevant that whatever the future developments of air transport may be,, the number of posts for which men of the higher standard of training will be required will, be limited and that men possessing the combination of theoretical aptitude and practical ability needed to profit by the highest kind of professional training are not numerous. Before the war the total yearly number of honour graduates in engineering, including civil, mechanical, electrical engineering and naval architecture, from all the Univer-necessities in the United Kingdom was not high, and only a fraction of the future number are likely to devote themselves entirely to aeronautics.&apos;:iJ16. In connection, however, with the question both of undergraduate and post-graduate education we would remark that the demands for the courses provided must depend considerably on the policy of the Government for the filling of such higher technical appointments as may be required by the Air Force or by the Air Ministry or whatever Department becomes responsible for the regulation of civil aviation. If technical appointments are thrown open to competition among graduates (as is done, for example, with the medical branches of the Naval and Military Services) the demands for the training provided in the University courses will be greater than if the State itself trains youths selected at an early age.17. The Zaharoff Professorship of Aviation supplies the nucleus of the single organisation which we think is desirable for the direction of higher education in aeronautics. This Professorship was established as the result of a benefaction to the British Government by Sir Basil Zaharoff, G.B.E., and it has been arranged between the parties concerned that it should be established as a Professorship of the University of London and held at the Imperial College.In our opinion the Imperial College should become the Centra] school for advanced study in aeronautical science, and we have, in the later sections of the report, described an organisation for teaching and research whereby this might be secured.18. It is clear that it would exceed the powers or abilities of any single teacher to cover all or many of the various fields of knowledge which are comprised under the general term of aeronautics. The appointment of additional teachers and the organisation of the Department of Aeronautics should be effected with the fullest regard to the resources which the Imperial College already possesses . for providing instruction in interdependent subjects such as Physics, Mathematics and Engineering.19. The teaching personnel of the actual Department of Aeronautics should, we think, comprise professors or lecturers qualified to provide advanced instruction as regards Aeroplanes, Seaplanes, Airships, and Kite-balloons, in the following subjects: (1) aerodynamics, i.e., the laws of motion of bodies moving in the air, (2) aero-engines and method of propulsion, (3) design, including structure and materials in so far as these could not be treated apart from the principle of design of aircraft in the Engineering and other departments of the College, (4), Meteorology, Instruments and Navigation.20. We consider that it is of importance that the same staff should to a great extent deal with both education and research, including much of the research directly required by the Government as well as that directed more especially to the advancement of the theory of flight. The expense involved in aeronautical research and the limited number of men competent to undertake it both lead to this result, which is in our view in itself desirable. We discuss this question in greater detail in Sections 59-62 of our Report. , .RESEARCH IN AERONAUTICS.21. The establishments which will be required to provide the facilities for the different aspects of research in aeronautics fall under five divisions :-(1) Model Research; (2) Full Scale Research ;:* Vide paragraph 24 of the Final Keport of Special Committee No. 5 of the Civil Aerial Transport Committee : ,;As outlined above, the specialised training of the aeronautical engineer would be a post-graduate course, and the question arises as to the nature of the institutions at which such courses should be organised. It has already been pointed out that whatever the development of the industry may be, the number of posts suitable for men of the highest standard of training is necessarily limited, and it is equally obvious tliat men possessing the combination of theoretical aptitude and practical ability required to profit by such a training are not numerous. Before the war the total yearly number of honours graduates in engineering, including civil, mechanical, electrical engineering, and naval architecture, &amp;c, from all the universities in the United Kingdom averaged about two hundred. .
(3) Testing and Experimental Investigation; . ,      (4) Special investigations connected with Airships and Kite-balloons;   . . (5) Navigation and Meteorology. . .Model Research.22. This includes model work in connection with aeroplanes, with seaplanes and with airships (rigid and non-rigid airships and kite-balloons). The model research work under these heads is at present carried on at the National Physical Laboratory and also to some extent at the Royal Aircraft Establishment.The fact that under the arrangements we propose research work at the National Physical Laboratory and the Pull Scale Research Establishment will both be under the control of a Board of Aeronautical Research should remove any lack of touch which might exist between those responsible for model work and those conducting full scale investigation. The National Physical Laboratory also contains facilities for research in Allied Sciences.Foil Scale Research and Experimental Investigation.&apos; 23. This work comprises research undertaken to investigate general principles and laws and is at present mainly represented by the experimental side of the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Full scale research on seaplanes has so far been mainly conducted by the Technical Department of the Air Ministry at the Isle of Grain and at Felixstowe, that on airships by the Admiralty at Kingsnorth and Pulham, while Kite-balloons have been investigated at Roehampton.The Royal Aircraft Establishment and the aerodrome attaching to it are Govern-ment property, and it appears to us that suitable provision might be^ made either there or possibly at some other aerodrome near London for the full scale work which is essential to our scheme. Adequate facilities for the scheme already exist at Farnborough along with other facilities for production work which would not be necessary. We, therefore, recommend that such portions of the establishment as are required for our purpose should be transferred&apos; to the organisation described in the report.&apos;5&apos;Under such an organisation the research work at the Royal Aircraft Establishment should we suggest come under the following heads :- (a) Experimental work for the advancement of aeronautics generally.   Theresults should have open scientific publication, and participation in the experimental work should be among&apos;the educational facilities available at the establishment.(b) Specific experimental work undertaken at the request of a Governmentdepartment. The publication of the results of the work would be a matter for the Government to decide.(e) - Certain specific experimental and testing work on payment for the industry.The establishment at Farnborough could not; of course, meet completely the need for full scale research and experiment on seaplanes and on. airships, much of which must be continued to be carried out elsewhere. But while this is so, there are many problems common to all kinds of aircraft which could be dealt with&apos; at Farnborough.Special Investigations connected with Airships and Kite-balloons.24, Full scale work on airships has been mainly carried on at Pulham Air Station, while kite-balloons have been dealt with at Roehampton, the model work, as in the .case of aeroplanes and seaplanes, having been mainly done at the National ; Physical Laboratory. Here again arrangements must continue for full scale work to be carried on at some station possessing suitable facilities, and we look forward to. the co-operation of the authorities dealing directly with those forms of aircraft in investiga-tions needing facilities under their control. Arrangements could, no doubt, be made for such investigations to go on under the supervision of the Research organisation.; . * The scale of the establishment would be sufficient to enable testing work to be carried out there in addition to pure research work. It would in that case be necessary to provide safeguards against undue preference being given to the testing work on the.ground.of its more immediate practical importance. :^Subject to the provision of these safeguards the association of research and testing work would probably prove of great instructive value to the technical staff concerned.A &apos;3
Navigation and Meteorology.25. Co-ordination of work under these two heads is at present lacking. Research work has been represented by the Meteorological Office, by the Meteorological Depart-ment of the Air Ministry (the personnel of which, was recently transferred from the Admiralty), as well as by the Admiralty, and to some extent and for limited purposes by the R.E. services of the Army.We understand that a general reorganisation of the existing arrangements is under consideration, and the interest&apos; of the aeronautical services, not only in the collection and dissemination of meteorological information, but also in the furtherance of meteorological research, will no doubt be recognised.The study of navigational problems, it may be remarked, has not been developed by the war to the same extent as some other aspects of air technology. The increasing-range of air travel serves to emphasise the needs for the fullest development of experiment in these directions, and the imminent introduction of aerial transport on a civil basis will greatly enlarge the demand upon bath practical and theoretical meteorology.We are of opinion that it is desirable in this regard to maintain close touch with the Meteorological Office and to make full use of its facilities for the collection and dissemination of information.Testing and Experimental Investigation.26. This class of work, as apart from that referred to in Section 21 (3), is at present represented by Martlesham Heath. It includes the determination of the performance of machines, tests of the efficiency of particular engines, and of minor modifications of machines and engines as affecting efficiency. This class of work may also include testing of typical machines to conformity with specification, as well as strength testing to destruction.A station of this character is required but need not form a part of this organisation.* Interests concerned in Research.27. We pow turn to an enumeration of the different interests concerned in the conduct of aeronautical research in varying degrees but in all cases to a sufficient extent to require some voice in its control. They are (a) the State as responsible for the maintenance of the armed Forces of the Crown by land, sea, and air; (b) the Aircraft Industry as constructors and as operators ; (c) Education and in particular the organisations providing higher education, and (d) the State as the regulating authority for civil aerial transport.Military Interests oJ the State.28. The scope of the State&apos;s responsibilities will be based on. the future require-ments of national defence, and it is probable that the aerial defence of the country will not be less important than that of naval and military defence on sea and land. Under present conditions, however, there is nothing to suggest any basis of expen-diture on fighting aircraft either absolute or in proportion to expenditure on the Navy and Army. /29. We desire, however, to refer to one factor which seems to us of the first ; importance in the determination of the State&apos;s responsibilities as regards provision for research. In the pre-war Naval Estimates between one third and one half of the total vote was allocated to new construction, research and experimental work forming only a small incidental item. The larger naval units take a number of years to build. For that reason only a relatively small increase of effective construction, can be brought about after a declaration of war; and supremacy, other things being equal, would be decided by the number and quality of the units available at the outbreak of hostilities. In the case of aircraft, however, the experience of the present war has been that a given type is becoming obsolete by the time that it is in general use. This applies essentially to the fighting scout machines, in a lesser degree to other types and least of all to airships.Regard must also be had to the high rate of wastage of aircraft under war conditions. There is, moreover, the liability of machines kept in store to become unfit for use, which makes it difficult (apart from financial considerations) to maintain a large peace reserve of machines.The final supremacy in the air in any future war will thus depend not mainly on the number of units available at the outbreak of hostilities, but on the adequacy of the preparation made beforehand for. the rapid construction of the newest and best types.
30. This preparation, so far as it.might take the form of administrative arrange-ments for the maintenance of equipment for large emergency production, is not within; the terms of our reference, but it is clear that such preparation must in any event; imply the ordered availability of (a) general scientific knowledge accumulated by systematic research, (b) detailed information with regard to all available types, (c) a liberal construction (not necessarily by the State itself) of experimental machines.It is relevant also to observe in connection with the organisation both of research and education, that any emergency expansion of production which might be required by a future war must be directed by a body of technical experts who could not be improvised after the emergency had arisen.The Aircraft Industry as Constructors and as Operators.31. Economic and Imperial considerations alike emphasize the importance of securing that the aircraft industry of this country should be so organised as to maintain a supremacy against all competitors from other countries, and it is obvious that generous provision for scientific research is necessary for the efficiency of an industry so highly technical and scientific as that of aircraft construction.It is, however, improbable that individual firms of designers or constructors could provide themselves with the research facilities which will be required. This is clear both from considerations of expense and of the insufficiency of men competent to undertake research work. The conduct of research on an individualistic basis, even if it were otherwise practicable, would involve a great deal of overlapping, and though it might enable individual firms to compete with each other, would not necessarily or even probably secure that their scientific resources would be organised in the best way to meet competition in international markets.32. The formation of an Industrial Research Association, which is now being proceeded with by negotiation between the Society of British Aircraft Constructors and the Department&apos; of Scientific and Industrial Research, implies a recognition of these considerations. Such an organisation, which should embrace within its member-ship all the leading firms of aircraft constructors is, in our view, essential to the conduct of research in the industrial aspect.Education.33. Access to research facilities is required (a) to enable the Imperial College to discharge its responsibilities for higher education in aeronautics and allied branches of knowledge, and (6) for the furtherance of knowledge as an end in itself and without reference to any immediate needs, whether of the State or of the industry. It is not necessary for us to labour the importance of adequate provision for independent research of this kind, but we desire to make clear our opinion that it is essential to the progress of knowledge in aeronautical and the allied sciences. During the war purely theoretical investigations have inevitably been subordinated to those under-taken for war requirements. It is important that under peace conditions disinterested research should have proper scope.The State as regulating authority of Civil Transport.34. It appears from the terms of the Air Navigation Act that the State will as a regulating authority have powers, inter alia, to test and pronounce upon the airworthiness of machines in use for public purposes (that is to say, for carrying for hire or for the transport of mails). These functions will imply the laying down of conditions of strength, performance, and air endurance, and it will be necessary that the department exercising them should have access to research facilities.Common use of Research Establishments by the various Interests.35. From the foregoing paragraphs the conclusion has been reached that four different interests each in its degree require access to, establishments, where the types of research mentioned in Sections 21-25 are carried out, i.e, (1) Model Research, (2) Full Scale Research, &apos;(3) Testing and Experimental Investigation, (4) Navigational and Meteorological Research. .36. We are of opinion that so far as possible the research facilities should be organised on the basis of a common use of the same establishments by the various interests. ;    &quot;&apos; ::
We are.led to. this conclusion, as we have already remarked, by the need of conserving and utilising to the fullest degree the resources both in staff and equipment engaged in aeronautical research, and also bjr the fact that very great and, as it seems to us, unnecessary expenditure would be involved by any present duplication of; research establishments., The expenditure required for the provision and. maintenance of the various establishments will he very considerable. A Model Research Establishment involves the provision of wind channels and laboratory equipment. Full Scale Research implies unfettered access to a completely equipped aerodrome with large engineering workshop facilities. The same applies to testing work. Navigational and Meteorological Research too, cannot be efficiently maintained without expenditure on a liberal scale.Limitation of the number of establishments is imposed not only by the desirability of avoiding a dissipation of effort, hut also by the comparatively small number of persons who are at present qualified to direct the higher branches of education and research in aeronautics.37. The principle of a common organisation of research stations is, however, subject to certain qualifications.(a) Many researches of exclusively naval and military concern (such as, for example, armament research) must no doubt to a considerable extent continue to be carried on at service stations by service personnel, though assistance in particular problems should be available from the various establishments for research in aero-nautics and in other allied branches of knowledge.(b) It will be necessary to provide that the use of common facilities does not of itself imply the complete pooling of results, (i) This must necessarily apply as regards confidential investigations undertaken for Government purposes ; (ii) it may also be found desirable to make arrangements whereby individual firms of aircraft constructors will be able to have industrial experiments carried out for their private information. The arrangements under which this will be done should be &quot;settled between any Research Organisation set up as a result of our recommendations and the Industrial Research Association as representative of the industry.(c) The administrative functions of the State in regard to &quot;type-testing &quot; and the examination of aircraft for use in public services may require that the Department responsible should be furnished with a testing station wholly administered by that Department.   (See Section 26 above).(d). VVe think it is of importance to encourage decentralisation of research on aeronautical problems which do not demand elaborate equipment or involve actual flying. There are many branches of research of the first degree of interest which do not involve access to aerodromes or to elaborate aeronautical equipment and which can therefore be carried on in other institutions. These include, for example, the study of raw materials (timber and fabrics), strength investigations of parts of structures, improvements in fuels, engine investigations, the chemistry of dopes, and mathematical investigations of all kinds.Control of Research Facilities.38. The maintenance of a common use of the same research facilities by the various interests concerned depends on the contrivance of a form of control of these facilities which will command the confidence of all parties. We have come to the conclusion that it will be necessary for this purpose to set up a Research Organisation representative of the various interests, including the Industry and the Teaching Authority.This organisation should, we consider, take the form of a Research Board which would control such Government Institutions as were placed in its charge, administer the funds available for this work, keep in close touch with the trade and educational authorities, and be in a position to advise generally on the scientific aspects of aeronautics.Later sections of the report deal more fully with the constitution and duties of such an organisation.39. Various alternatives to such a plan have been considered. Among these we have examined the possibilities of control (1) by the Teaching Authority, (2) by the Aircraft Industry acting through the organisation of an Industrial Research Association, (3) by the Air Ministry acting directly.40. The case for control either by the Teaching Authority or by an Association of the Industry can we think he dismissed at once.As regards the former we are of opinion that the amount of administrative work involved in the maintenance of plant and equipment and the executive control of
the staff in the various stations would impose upon the College a burden which is foreign to its normal functions, and which we have no reason to believe that it would desire to undertake. The system of grants-in-aid by which subventions from public funds are made to the Universities would, moreover, be peculiarly difficult of appli-cation to the finance of an aeronautical research organisation with growing and uncertain needs.41. Control by the Aircraft Industry through a Research Association is open to similar and to even greater objections. The maintenance of a research organisation is, as we have shown, deeply involved with questions of national defence. It is evident, moreover, that the greater part of the cost of their provision and maintenance will in some form or another be furnished from state funds. In these conditions it is certain that no Government would admit the principle of such control.42. Direct control of the Research Stations by the Air Ministry - (e.g., through a Technical Section) is obviously more&quot; feasible than either of the above methods. We are of opinion, however, that neither the civilian air interests nor public opinion avouIcI be disposed to accept such control if exercised by the Air Ministry qua military department. The requirements of military and civil aeronautics will no doubt tend to diverge more and more, and it is, we think, clear that control of research should be civilian in character.43. The arguments for direct control by the civil department of the Air Ministry are no doubt more cogent, but we do not recommend this course for the following reasons : (1) It is preferable that the research facilities, if they are for the purposes of both the State and the Industry, should not be subordinated to that Department of State which necessarily exercises a controlling or regulating authority over the Industry. (2) Public and scientific opinion will, we think, be more fully enlisted on the side of adequate financial support if the control of research is put on a broader basis than that of an administrative department. (3) There must be a close connection between research and education, and this we consider may be more easily effected if the control does not rest solely in the hands of the Air Ministry. (4) It is important to connect research in aeronautics closely with research in other cognate branches of science and. industry ; the Air Ministry is not, we think, the best agent for this task. 44. Dismissing then these alternatives we have come to the conclusion that a Research Board such as we have outlined in Section 38 is necessary.   Such a Board must be connected with some Department of State and obtain its funds from Parliament through a Minister at the head of that Department.   Here, again, two alternatives seem open.The Board could be constituted either as a Board of the Air Ministry or of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.We have decided to recommend the latter alternative because we consider the arguments against direct control by the Air Ministry adduced in Section 43 apply equally in this case, and also because the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was established for the promotion of research and would be, in our opinion, in a better position to co-ordinate the various forms of research which may affect aeronautical development; it is in various ways closely connected with education, and it is, moreover, already responsible for the financial administration of the National Physical Laboratory.Establishment of a Board of Aeronautical Research.45. We recommend therefore that a Board of Aeronautical Research should be constituted in connection with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for the control of research in aeronautics. The present constitution of that Depart-ment enables it to hold through the Imperial Trust for the Encouragement of Scientific and Industrial Research any funds or land, buildings, and equipment which may have to be transferred from their present ownership.Constitution of the Board of Aeronautical Research.46. The Board of Aeronautical Research should include representation (a) of the Department or Departments responsible for (i) naval and militaryaeronautics, (ii) the regulation of civil aerial transport;(b) of the Aircraft Industry;-(c) of the Imperial College, as well as -   :(d) other members of scientific attainments.o   7806 B
The chairman of the Board should oe a scientist of eminence, and in a position independent of any of the Departments represented on the Board.He and the other non-official members of the Board should receive suitable remuneration.Functions of the Board of Aeronautical Research.47. It should be the duty of the Board to devote itself to the advance of Aeronautical Science, and with this object in particular (1) to advise on scientific problems relating to the construction and navigation of aircraft;(2) to be responsible for researches and experiments carried out for the advancement of aeronautical science in the Government Institutions and Laboratories under their charge ;(3) to promote education in aeronautics by co-operating with the Governors of the Imperial College;(4) to assist the aeronautical industry of the country by scientific advice and research;(5) to prepare for the approval of the Committee of Council for Scientific and Industrial Research a scheme of work and estimate of expenditure for the year, and to administer the funds placed at its disposal by the Committee of Council;(6) to make reports from time to time to the Committee of Council, which reports should he laid before Parliament.Transfer of the Royal Aircraft Establishment to the Board of Aeronautical Research.48. In our view, and as we have alreadyfindicated in Section 23, the Royal Aircraft Establishment should continue to be the main centre for full scale research and investigation, and for this purpose so much of the buildings and land as are required should be transferred to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.49. Under existing conditions we do not propose that the administrative responsibility for any station other than the Royal Aircraft Establishment should necessarily be transferred. The resources and equipment of Farnborough are such that probably three quarters of the fundamental aeronautical research should be carried out there. As regards the remainder, i.e., full scale research on lighter-than-air craft and special researches on seaplanes, adequate facilities should in our opinion be provided elsewhere, as stated in Section 24.Board of Aeronautical Research to replace Advisory Committee.50. We propose that the Board of Aeronautical Research should replace the present Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, discharging in the main the functions of that body. On this point it is desirable to refer briefly to the present functions of the Advisory Committee.51. The Committee was originally appointed to advise the Prime Minister as Chairman of the Imperial Defence Committee, to determine what problems should be studied, and by what methods, and to discuss and offer advice on the solutions, it was the duty of the Committee to superintend the investigations at the National Physical Laboratory and to advise generally on the scientific problems arising in connection with the work of the Admiralty and War Office in aerial construction and navigation.Since the inception of the Air Ministry the Committee has reported to the Secretary of State for the Royal Air Force instead of to the Prime Minister, its duties remaining unaltered. The Air Ministry, Admiralty, and WTar Office have been repre-sented on the Committee by officers of high standing, and its responsibilities have been of a kind which greatly exceed those that can be adequately exercised by any Committee attached to a particular administrative department. This independent position has been, we think, of great value in securing co-ordination of research.52. A similar status should he secured for the Board of Aeronautical Research, and for this purpose it is we think necessary that the Board should be able to report directly not only to the Minister responsible for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, but also to the Ministers responsible for naval and military Aeronautics and for the regulation of civil aviation.53. The work of the Advisory Committee on Aeronautics is ordinarily carried out through a number of standing Sub-Committees. These Sub-Committees submit monthly programmes of work to the Main Committee, and the results of all the approved investigations are in the first place reported to and discussed by the Sub-Committees.
54. It should he added that the executive control of the staff responsible for carrying out investigations at the National Physical Laboratory rests not with the Advisory Committee but with the Executive Committee of the Laboratory which undertakes to carry them out in accordance with the wishes and advice of the Advisory Committee. The fact that the Chairman of the Advisory Committee also fills the post of Director of the Laboratory facilitates this arrangement.55. It will clearly be necessary that the Board of Aeronautical Research should have power to appoint Committees, membership of which should not be restricted to members of the Board itself. One such Committee will probably be required to administer the establishment at Farnborough.Financial and Administrative Arrangements.56. The annual expenditure of the Board of Research would form a part of the annual vote taken by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in Parliament. Under the normal arrangements of the Research Department proposals for research and estimates of cost are submitted to the Minister responsible for the Vote through the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research which reviews though it cannot amend or reject proposals for expenditure put forward by-any of the various Research Boards attached io the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Provision should be made for some direct representation of aeronautics on this Advisory Council. We assume that important proposals relating to Aeronautical Education and Research will not be put forward officially by the Department until they have been considered by the Board of Aeronautical Research.57. We consider that in the case of proposals for expenditure by the Board of Aeronautical Research the Minister should, be advised not only by the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research but also by an inter-departmental Council for Aeronautics, which should consist in a large measure of high officials of the Departments concerned with national policy in aeronautical matters together with independent men of scienee.Under this arrangement the proposals of the Board of Aeronautical Research would be reviewed and the Minister advised upon them (a) by the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in their scientific and industrial aspect and in their relation to the work in allied branches of Research, and (b) by the Inter-departmental Council from the point of view of national policy in aeronautics as a means of.defence and as a means of Imperial communication.The reasons for which, in our view, two advisory authorities are required are as follows: (1) Aeronautical research is closely connected with scientific research in several allied branches of knowledge, and it is clear that the work of the Board of Aero-nautical Research should be co-ordinated with other work for which the present Advisory Council is responsible.. (2) The importance, great at present, and potentially greater still, of aeronautics in connection with vital problems of defence and communications raises issues which are outside the functions of the Advisory Council, and which can only be effectively realised by the Departments of State concerned.58. We would urge in this matter the importance of the financial arrangements of the Board of Research being put on a basis which will allow an adequate freedom to the Board in the allocation of expenditure within the limits of the total sum available.The systems of control of expenditure, which are normal for Government Departments, at all events under peace conditions, require modification when questions of research arise. Heavy expenditure may be needed for some im-portant research, unforeseen at the time of preparing the estimates. The Board of Aeronautical Research should have at its disposal a sufficient sum to meet such expenditure, if urgently needed, without waiting for special approval. While, again, stated rates of salary and normal increments are essential it will be necessary to give the Board power, within due limits, to reward meritorious services in order to retain members of the staff of outstanding value or to attract experts whose assistance, either temporarily or permanently, is of importance to the work. It is, of course, hardly possible for an institution, financed mainly from public funds, to compete in the matter of personnel with exceptional offers from private employers,B 2
but it is of great importance that the central research organisation should have such measure of financial freedom as is practicable. One method might be to place a erant-in-aid at the disposal of the Board for these purposes.Co-ordination of the Research and Educational Organisation.59. We have referred earlier in this Report (Section. 13) to the need for close association between the research and experimental work and the strictly academic portion of the higher education. No school for providing this education can be successful unless the students are brought into direct touch with practical problems during their tuition, and unless those engaged in teaching are also engaged in or directing scientific research or experimental design.60. The arrangements whereby the student will divide his period of post-graduate instruction between work on books and at lectures, and practical work at research stations to which we have already referred, should apply also in regard to the duties of the teaching Staff. These should be such as to enable a professor or lecturer to spend part of his time in giving instruction at the Imperial College while giving the rest to investigations at one of the research centres.. 61. As stated in Section 19 the School of Aeronautics should provide advanced instruction as regards aeroplanes, seaplanes, airships and kite-balloons in (1) aero-dynamics) ; (2) aero-engines and methods of propulsion ; (3) design, including structure and materials ; (4) instruments, meteorology and navigation. It Avould follow, there-fore, that certain of the professors or lecturers in each of these subjects will discharge double responsibilities (a) as members of the stall of the Imperial College and (b) as officers of the research organisation directed by the Board of Aeronautical Research.62. The Interim and Final Reports of Special Committee No. 5 of the Civil Aerial Transport Committee contain much valuable information as to the organisation of teaching and research. One factor of importance which they emphasise is the need for a trained staff to act as a clearing house for the co-ordination and dissemination of aeronautical knowledge in all its aspects. The Central School of Aeronautics should in our view serve this purpose.The functions of the teaching staff of the School may be stated under four distinct, though closely related, purposes : (a) To study, co-ordinate, summarise, apply and&apos; extend the knowledge derived from the experimental work carried out by the individual workers at various experimental stations in this country and abroad.(/)) To stimulate research by indicating what information is most urgently required and what line of attack is likely to prove most profitable.(c) To guide and encourage research by constructive criticism based on a careful study of past and current work in this country and abroad.(d) To impart this knowledge by personal teaching to a limited number of post graduate students.A similar clearing house for current knowledge would be of value in any science, but for Aeronautics it is, for the present, essential, for whereas in older sciences  Physics, for instance-the bulk of the experimental data have, throughout the course of generations, crystallised into well-defined laws which form a framework ready to receive any new facts and a criterion by which their accuracy can be estimated, in Aeronautics the facts are the result of the work of the last 5 or 10 years, and the framework uniting them exists only in the minds of the few men who have been personally connected with the process of development.Before the war the total available knowledge was small, and it was possible for the members of the Advisory Committee to keep all the facts in mind while devoting the majority of their time to other duties. They then provided the necessary co-ordinating factor. This is no longer possible, and the function could best.be discharged by the staff of the School working under their Director with -a view to co-ordinating and making available all the knowledge in each branch of the work as existing at&apos; the moment.For these reasons it is essential that the permanent staff of the Central School should be adequate both in numbers and in range of experience to the duties outlined above.
63. It has been arranged that the Zaharoff Professor of Aviation should be Director of the School of Aeronautics in the Imperial College. We consider that he ought to have an important voice in the direction of research, not only in the College but at the Central Research Establishment and elsewhere. He would naturally be a member of the Board of Aeronautical Research, and in this way be brought into intimate contact with the investigations in all the stations. The work would occupy his full time. These considerations will no doubt be borne in mind by the Body responsible for making the appointment.It will also be necessary to have a full-time Professor of Aerodynamics at a salary, say, of 1,0001.64. The engineering questions relating to airships and kite balloons are of such -importance and so distinct, as to require the full time of a senior officer who would devote himself to teaching and research, and whose duty it would also be to ensure that special problems relating to these subjects were adequately dealt with in the courses of instruction on aircraft engines and strength of materials. For this purpose we recommend the appointment of a Professor of Airship Construction.65. The subject of Meteorology, including with it training in navigation and the use of instruments employed in flight is one of great importance. The position, however, of the teacher of this subject must depend on the action taken with regard to research and inquiry into Meteorological Science generally. We have made provision in the estimates for a teacher in meteorological subjects closely connected with aeronautics who should combine this work with research at one of the experimental stations. His work would be brought into connection with the Central Meteorological Department if that be ultimately established. We would add that quite apart from the other interests concerned we feel it our duty to press for the establishment of a properly equipped centre of teaching in this subject, the need for which has been felt for some years and is now acute.66. Our estimates of the numbers and cost of the total establishment at present required for the Department of Aeronautics at the Imperial College is given in Appendix A.The dual functions of research, and education might perhaps be combined as shown below: Imperial College. Research Organisation.1. Professor of Aerodynamicsv    -  Aerodynamics Research, Central research establishment.2. Professor   or   Lecturer    on  Engine  Research  Laboratory,   Central Engines   and   Methods   of     Research Establishment. Propulsion.3. Professor or Lecturer on Design  Design Branch of Central Research Estab-lishment or Designer of some Private Firm.4. Professor of Airship Construction  Research Officer at Pulham Air Station.Clearly, however, the feasibility of such combinations must depend on the men available, and the above is only put forward as a possible arrangement.67. It is obvious that this duality of functions can only be maintained on a basis of goodwill and readiness to co-operate between the Imperial College with whom will be vested the appointments in the School of Aeronautics and the Board of Aeronautical Research with whom the control of the R.A.E. will rest, but we feel that the details of the method of establishing full co-operation should be left to the two bodies to determine.Estimated Cost of Educational and Research Organisation.68. (a) The main item will be the maintenance of the central research establishment at Farnborough. We estimate that the annual cost of maintenance, including salaries, labour, material, and all equipment (with aeroplanes), and depreciation should be at the maximum 450,0001. per.annum. This figure is based partly on the estimate of the expenditure for the year 1919-1920 at the Royal Aircraft Establishment for Research and Experiment as distinct from the production work which is carried on there.The cost of the Royal Aircraft Establishment during the last year of the war was approximately 2,000,OOOL We understand that the estimated cost for the financial year 1919-1920 is 1,000,000L, of which sum 407,0001. is allocated to the costB.8
RECOMMENDATIONS.Our recommendations are as follows : &apos; I. A Board of Aeronautical Research should be constituted in connection with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.Note. It is recognised that other Government Departments will maintain research organisations to deal with problems special to their own requirements so far as these cannot be effectively dealt with by the Research Organisation.II. The Board of Aeronautical Research should include representation (a) of the Department or Departments responsible for (i) naval and militaryaeronautics, (ii) the regulation of civil aerial transport;(b) of the Aircraft Industry ;(c) of the Imperial College; as well as(d) other members of scientific attainments.The Chairman of the Board should be a scientist of eminence, and in a position independent of any of the Departments represented on the Board.III. An Inter-Departmental Council for Aeronautics should be appointed which should be composed of representatives of the Departments concerned with national policy in aeronautical matters together with independent men of science.IV. Provision should also be made for some direct representation of aeronautics on the existing Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.of labour and material for production work. If the salaries and general overhead charges for this portion of the work are taken at 250,0001, the sum allocated to research would be about 350,0001. To this amount would have to be-added the cost of aeroplanes which have been, under existing arrangements, a charge upon Air Force funds, and which we estimate at 100,0001. per annum, making a total, as stated above, of 450,0001.An independent estimate which we have made, based upon the present numbers of the scientific and technical staff (about 200), and allowing for a future non-technical establishment of 800 employees, has led-us to approximately the same figure.(6) The estimated expenditure of the aeronautical department at the National Physical Laboratory for the year 1919-1920 (salaries, labour, running expenses, and equipment) is about 33,0001.(c) We estimate that the cost of the Department of Aeronautics at the Imperial College, with salaries on the standards of remuneration which obtain in existing Departments of the College, together with an allowance for wages of mechanics and cost of laboratory experiments should amount to about 10,0001. a year. (See Appendix A). Towards this sum the income of the Zaharoff endowment of  25,000 is all that is at present available.(d) The fees of the non-official members of the Board of Aeronautical Research . must also be allowed for, but this will be a minor item.The total cost of the Education and Research Organisation should thus be in the neighbourhood of 500,000Z. a year. No provision is made in this estimate for the cost of research hearing on Seaplanes and&apos;Airships (including Kite Balloons) con-ducted elsewhere than at Farnborough.69. Since we prepared this report we have learned that it is proposed to establish a Professorship of Aeronautical Engineering in Cambridge University. On this proposal we desire to draw attention to Section 15 of our Report, in which we have discussed the provision required for advancing training and research in Aero-nautics and the probable numbers of men for whom such facilities will be required. We have there stated as our considered opinion that there is no room for more than one organisation fully equipped and maintained on the standard requisite for the advance of aeronautical science and practice. We consider it therefore important that this view should be brought to the knowledge of the Cambridge Authorities with an expression of the desire that the Government may have the co-operation of the University in giving effect to this policy.70. In conclusion we -desire to express our appreciation of the work of our Secretary, Mr. Evans, and to thank him for the effective assistance he has rendered to us.
V. It should be the duty of the Board of Aeronautical Research to devote itself to the advance of Aeronautical Science, and, with this object, in particular-(1) to advise on scientific problems relating to the construction and navigation of aircraft;(2) to be responsible for researches and experiments carried out in the Govern-ment Institutions and Laboratories under their charge for the advancement of Aeronautical Science;(3) to promote education in aeronautics by co-operating with the Governors of the Imperial College;(4) to assist the Aeronautical Industry of the country by scientific advice and research;(5) to prepare for the approval of the Committee of Council for Scientific and Industrial Research a Scheme of Work and Estimate of Expenditure for the year, and to administer the funds placed at its disposal by the Committee of Council in accordance with Recommendation VIII.;(6) to make reports from time to time to the Committee of Council, which reports should oe laid before Parliament.VI. The Board should replace the present Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and its non-official members should receive suitable remuneration.VII. Such parts of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough as are required for the purpose should be transferred to the administration of the Board as an Institution for Aeronautical Research. The ownership of the land, buildings and equipment should be vested in the Imperial Trust for the Encouragement of Scientific and Industrial Research.VIII.. The expenditure of the Board should form part of the Annual Vote taken by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and the arrangements should be such as to allow adequate freedom to the Board within the limits of the total sum available.IX. Research work on seaplanes and airships carried out by the Board which cannot be done at the Royal Aircraft Establishment should be carried on elsewhere, arrangements being made with the Department or Departments concerned to provide access to facilities for this work.X. It is not in our opinion practicable to establish a School of Aeronautics at more than one institution providing the specialised training required by those who are to direct aeronautical research and the design and construction of aircraft. For this purpose we recommend that a Department of Aeronautics in the Imperial College under the Directorship of the Zaharoff Professor of Aviation should be established for the provision of advanced instruction in Aeronautics generally on the lines indicated in Sections 62 to 66 of our Report. The scheme for the Depart-ment should be framed with full regard to the facilities provided in existing Departments of the Imperial College and should be settled in consultation with the Board of Aeronautical Research. It should be left to the Governing Body of the Imperial College and the Board of Aeronautical Research to determine a method of mutual co-operation.XI.

University of London. South Kensington. London, S.W.28th July, 1919.Sir,Referring to my letter of May 28th 1919 and to the interview between General Seely and Representatives of the University on Wednesday;, June 25th* I have now to inform you that the Board of Advisors in connexion with the Zaharoff Chair of Aviation met again on July 16th and reported as follows:-The Board desire to inform the Senate that they are of opinion that the field of candidates for the Zoharoff Chair will depend very largely on tho decision of the Government in regard to the Recommendations of Sir Richard Glasebrookfs Committeej   that pending that decision it is impossible to give candidates any information as to the provision which can be made for Research and additional teaching in connexion with the subject of the Chair;   and that the whole character of the Chair and of tho qualifications required to fill it must depend on the nature aM extent of such provision.   In view of those circumstances, to their great regret, the Board feel unable at present to proceed further with their reference;   and they recommend the Senate strongly to ur,r;e the Government to make a decision in regard to the proposals of the - Glfl^ebrook Committee at the earliest possible moment.The Senate at thoir recent meeting endorsed the vie   of the Board and requested me to make representations to His Majestyfs Government accordingly.The Air Ministry are aware that it was through their agency that the Zaharoff Chair was offered to, and was accepted by, the University of London, and that; the offer vras. made in the first instance more than two years&apos; ago;   and I understand from my interview with General Seely on June 25th that the Air Ministry are nob less desirous than the Senate of obtaining a decision in regard to the proposals of fie G-lazebrook Comr:committee without delay,/ and that the decision rests with the 0ab5.net.I trust that the Air Ministry will convey to the Cabinet&quot;fche disappointment which is felt not only by the University but by all those interested in aeronautical research at the delay which lias occurred, avid that they will press on His MajestyJs Government tho very great importance of tailing prompt action for the organisation of research in aviation for civil purposes as well as for naval and military purposes, &quot;Without which this country is likely to fall seriously behind other countries in this matter.I am,Sir,Your obediont Servant,(Sd.)   l\G, Perry,Vice Chancellor.The Secretary,The Air Ministry,Hotel Cecil, I7.C.copy*
