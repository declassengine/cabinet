[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Eajesffis Government,jPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1919.SECRET.I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office on ^advantages of taking immediate steps for the rehabilitation of Austria.C. of K.MEMORANDUM FOR THE &quot;WAR CABINET.The advantages, commercial and political, of giving financial assistance to german. Austria.THE War Cabinet have already been supplied with copies of two memoranda on conditions in Austria prepared by Sir F. Oppenheimer as the result of his mission to-Vienna in May last. In these memoranda (copies of which are annexed) Sir F. Oppenheimer indicated the desperate plight of the country, the moral obligation o/f the Allies to relieve the prevailing distress, and the political advantages which might be confidently expected to result from such action. Even before the receipt of these memoranda it had been realised at the Foreign Office that the question of Austria was one of peculiar importance from the purely political point of view, and there-fore no time was lost in submitting the memoranda to the Treasury for their opinion and to Mr. Balfour, whose attention was drawn to the urgency of the question.The Treasury stated in reply that it was impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-meht to consider these problems independently of the Allies, and that the matter should therefore be referred to the Peace Delegation. The Treasury added that it should be understood \from the outset that British resources are such, at the present time, that any assistance which could be given, even in conjunction with the Allies, would be very limited in amount.This question is, however, acknowledged on all hands to be one of u/rgency and importance, and it was felt at the Foreign Office that no rapid decision would be attained by reference to the Peace Delegation, especially as this is a matter in which the interests of the. various Allies are likely to come into conflict. At the same time it was considered that, in view of the very definite pronouncement of the Treasury, further interdepartmental correspondence would be useless owing to the paramount importance of the issues involved. The object, therefore, of this paper is to lay before the War Cabinet certain considerations which may not have been previously apparent, with a view to * the adoption of a more definite policy.In the first place it is not now merely a question of making a loan or granting credits to Austria, to enable her to restart her industries, seeing that an influential group of Austrian financial leaders have come forward with concrete proposals which appear worthy of earnest consideration. The proposal, put very shortly, is that either His Majesty ^Government or a British financial syndicate should send at once to Vienna financial, mining and textile representatives to enquire into the position of the leading Austrian firms, and acquire options on 20 per cent, of fhe capital of the best. This Commission could then return to England with an Austrian representative, preferably from Rothschilds of Vienna, to arrange details with the English syndicate. It is thought that ;the 20 per cent, of the capital in the various companies would give the British syndicate a controlling interest in the Austrian firms. This would immediately place the syndicate in possession of a large sum of Austrian money and would secure for this country very large and important commercial interests in Central Europe. It should be noted that this proposal comes direct from the Austrians to Colonel Sir T. Cuninghame, and it is a proof that the Austrians are anxious to do business with us rather than with the Americans, French, or Italians. Should we be wise to throw away this oppor-tunity ? If we do not accept, it will no doubt then be offered to the Americans, who are not likely to consult their associates before accepting it.
It would appear that this proposal offers us an excellent opportunity for creating a very favourable market for ourselves in Austria, and this is more impor-tant than would perhaps at first sight appear. The potentialities of Austria itself are small at present, but it seems almost inevitable that Vienna must remain in the future, as in the past, the commercial and linancial capital of the congeries of States which once formed the Austro- Hungarian Empire. Vienna owes this to its position on the Danube, to the railway system of the old Empire, of which it is the centre, and to the fact that practically the entire banking system was in Habsburg days concentrated in the city. If we obtain a strong position in Vienna we immediately strengthen our position in Bohemia, in Hungary, and even in Jugo-Slavia. All these countries wish to trade with us, and we shall be able also to facilitate regular interchanges between the various States, thus helping to solve one of the great problems of Central Europe while profiting ourselves at the same time.The present moment would seem to be particularly favourable for sending out a Commission of the kind proposed. The fall of Bela Kun in Hungary will have given, confidence to the capitalists, and there is now a possibility of freeing a considerable quantity cf Austrian money which has been locked up in Hungary. On the other hand, if steps are not taken soon, winter will have come with no arrange-ment completed with the Czechs for supplying Vienna with fuel. The resulting misery may well lead to an outbreak of hopeless chaos in the midst of which no such proposal as this could hope to succeed.Apart, however, from the commercial aspeict of the question, the political advantages of the proposal are even more important.   Vienna again is the crux of the problem.   It is not too much to say that unless some arrangement can be made soon this great city will be faced with absolute starvation.   It is utterly impossible to feed its two to three million inhabitants from the resources of Austria proper: its granary is in Hungary and its fuel is drawn from Bohemia.  Already there is great suffering in the city, and it is surprising that there have not yet been serious outbreaks and the establishment of a Bolshevist regime.  This is no doubt due in part to the easy-going nature of the Viennese, but the thinking Austrian must now see that he has come to the parting of the ways.  Either Vienna, must fall in ruins and Austria be given up to communism, or she must be absorbed in Germany.  The average Austrian has not forgotten 1866, and has no wish for this solution, but it does offer a chance of existence and, if the Allies do not help, it is the only way out of the impasse.  The political dangers of this fusion of Austria with Germany have frequently been set forth, but it may be convenient briefly to recapitulate them.  Once Germany is in Vienna she is again on the high road to the Balkans and Constantinople, and will resume her &apos;,&apos; Drang nach Osten &quot; policy, one of the causes of this war.  The problem-of the German minority in Bohemia at once becomes acute: and the continuance of the Czecho-Slovak Eepublic is definitely threatened.   It will also mean that Italy and Germany become direct neighbours, and in the former&apos;s present state of mind it is not difficult to picture the dangers to which such association might give rise.  It is already well known that the Italians have not been idle during the time of the armistice, but have been intriguing in Hungary and Bulgaria against the Czechs and Jugo-Slavs.   With a renewal of Italo-German friendship these two countries would be doomed.On the other hand if we can now accept, or at least encourage, the Austrian proposals these dangers are obviated. If Austria can rehabilitate her trade and thus solve the problem of feeding Vienna, she will set her face sternly against union with Germany. She wishes to be friends with us and she knows that she must renew relations with the other States of the old Empire. She has no desire for the return of the Habsburg or the Habsburg regime, as has already been&apos; demonstrated by her attitude towards the: coup oVetat of the Archduke Joseph at Buda Pesth. We thus have at once a buffer between Germany and Italy, and a bar to German designs in the Balkans. Furthermore, it should be possible for us to create a paramount position, commercially and politically, in Central Europe if we once secure a firm footing at Vienna. It has already been shown that Vienna is the natural centre of that part of the world. All reports go to show that British prestige has never been so high in Austria, and it can be confidenly predicted that the Austrian Government would follow our advice. We are already allied with the Czechs and it is to our interests to support the Jugo-Slavs against the Italians. With the friendship of Austria too we secure a position of peculiar strength in the centre of Europe, and it should not be an insuperable task to sej:tle the animosities which are now so hopelessly dividing these different States.   These
oStates cannot stand alone: they must inevitably be interdependent: and in working for their co-operation we could at the same time push our own interests in.each State and open ufp considerable fields for the commercial enterprise of British traders.It is possible to secure these advantages if action is taken at once; but time is short, and unless an indication can be given to the Austrians within a few weeks of our interest in their affairs they must inevitably go elsewhere. It is submitted that we should not lose this opportunity, but that the offer of the Austrian bankers should be accepted and the proposed Commission sent out without delay.C.
