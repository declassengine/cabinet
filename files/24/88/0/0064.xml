Copy. *-8ocrot-&quot;Delhi&quot; in Biorko Sound, 30th August 1919.No, 544/535/3. &apos;pnQSir,With reference to Ad rLralty message No.805, I have the honour to submit my views as to the present situation resulting from the attack of tho 18th August 1919.2,-   It seems, from my information, that the Bolshevics now have available for action, two largo Destroyers, three older ones, and possibly two Submarines.From time to time it has been reported that &quot;SEBASTOPOP   \     and &quot;RURIC&quot; are in commission, but I raw believe this is not so - though they are trying to get tho latter ready.They have also four Minelayers ready loaded, and five Kihesweeping Trawlers, also five Flying Boats,55t-   The situation rather hinges on Fort Krasnaya Gorka -if this Fort was captured, as it well might be by Russian and Estonian Forcos any time once the latter agreed to gs forward; which they would do on the recognition of their Independence by the Allies;   then I believe Cronstadt would no longer hold out, as all reports go to show that they are in a very demoralised state, and that all thoir crews leave the commissioned ships on the arrival of our Bombers.4.-   For tho present I do not think it advisable to reduce the Force here, and for possibly a fortnight to come it is unlikely that exact information regarding the extent of damage to the &quot;PSTROPAVIOVSK&quot; and &quot;and report R3RV0ZANNI11 will be available.5.&quot;    These two ships dominated the situation when Krasnaya Gorka surrendered in Juno, and battered it back into submission again; but to do this they had to move outside tho Harbour, which I think can bo assumed they will not bo able to do again,6.-    But every report has shown that, but for those shins, Cronstadt would then havo surrendered also, in fact one or more of tho Forts did hoist the Tnite Slag.7,-    I think, with the Minesweepers I now have, that should their lordships sco fit to send mo two Long Range Monitors we could reduce Krasnaya Gorka, and possibly then deal with Cronstadt from there and with the guns of the Fort.8,-    The Estonians havo their plan ready for tho co ;i,inod operation, and it is one which I am sure will succeed, but they will noi move before thoir Independence is assured by the Allies.9..-The Secretary of the Admiralty, (Copy to the Com lander in Chief, HJU $rips h Vessels,Atlantic &amp; Home Fleets).
9.-   Wore we to withdraw or reduce our Force now, both Finland and Estonia would ho apprehensive, and the Bolshovics might well try J.&apos;inin: and Destroyer raids.10.-   By the ond of the Month I hope to have so observed and appreciated the situation as to be able,to say at any rate whether or not our Submarines are still necessary, and also what other reductions I feel can be reooiiuiended,11.&quot; - The Bolshevic Force fcn lake Ladoga, which iai(;ht be used as reinforcements, is six Destroyers; two good, and four older ones.I have, etc.........(Si/pied)  Walter Cowan.Rear-Adniral Senior Naval Officer, Baltic,
