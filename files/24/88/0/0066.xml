/^Military Secret, 108412418.   Malleson wires 9th September :-&quot;(Two corrupt groups) writes 3rd September. Peace news from Kabul through (corrupt group) party of merchants and Heratis was (? detained) by that portion of Herat garrison belonging to East Afghanistan. There is apparently no real belief in permanency of peace. Merchants are holding up stocks of supplies normally sent Meshed and have instructed Meshed agents to do same. Governor had received orders prohibiting people leaving their homes except on very urgent business when passes may be given. Kabul correspondents talk of &quot; next Jehad &quot; and say that this will take more decided form towards Persian side.&quot; 2. Shrine custodians have left Herat with great ceremony. They travel via Panjdeh to Karshi, Bokhara and Samarkand for the purpose of preaching Jehad against British and enlisting sympathy and help of all Central Asia Mahometans on behalf of Afghans.&quot; 3. Kazim Beg continues to raise loans on Herat. He says he has positive news from Baku, that British are in full flight from Caucasus ; that they are abandoning Armenians and Georgians to their fate as they abandoned Turkestan and will shortly abandon Turkestans.&quot;The ex-Shah is now on his way to Persia and with help of Bolsheviks, Turkey and Afghanistan will turn out British. He also says Bolsheviks will shortly bring fleets of aeroplanes to help the &quot; royal Ghazi &quot; Amanulla to enable him to victoriously renew Jehad against British.&quot;
