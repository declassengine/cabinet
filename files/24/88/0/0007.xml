The Movement of Prices and Labour Unrest.It was suggested in the last issue of this report that the measures now being taken to .check &quot; profiteering &quot; would only result in disappointment if something were not done to dispel the illusion that individual rapacity is the cause of the present high prices. The very natural desire to blame individuals, to find a scapegoat, has led in the popular mind to an undue simplification of the problem. An attempt is therefore made in what follows to bring out briefly the true connection between rising prices, &quot; profiteering ?&apos; and labour unrest. *&apos;-f The rise in prices is not eaused by &quot; profiteering &quot; ; on the contrary &quot; profiteering &quot; *m by&apos;that is meant the taking of a profit that represents no social service-is caused by the rise in prices. Essentially profit is the payment society makes for the taking of the risks of economic enterprise. When prices are stable or falling there is always a risk of loss involved in manufacture and commerce, which no mere technical efficiency can eliminate. This is the risk that between the initiation and the completion of the process of manufacture or the movement of goods a fall in prices may have taken place, with the result that the completed product does not fetch a price sufficient to cover the original cost of materials and the expenses of manufacture or movement. A steady an$ universal rise in prices, ^uch as has characterised the last, five years, eliminates this risk;; instead of a contest between,1 entrepreneur and consumer, in which the odds&apos; are even, the former is put in the position of calling &quot; Heads I win,&quot; tails you lose.&quot; The steady increment in money value of all goods, entirely unconnected as it is with any change in form, any adaptation for use or any movement from one place to another, constitutes a tax which the persons who buy and sell goods are able to levy on the(01877)  255  9/19  h &amp; s 2 E
community without rendering any service in return. The only method of stopping this tax is by a financial reform that will stop the rise in prices.&apos; When prices rise wages usually follow suit. Nevertheless a time of rising prices is usually a time of exceptional labour unrest, though not necessarily strikes,* for several reasons. In the first place, the rise in wages usually lags behind the rise in prices. Con-sequently profits increase more rapidly than wages, and the disparity in the distribution of wealth between the classes is increased. Further, so long as the rise in prices continues, no adjustment between wages and prices is final. No sooner have the workpeople often by strike or threat of strike secured an advance in wages comparable with the increase in the cost of living, than the need for a further advance becomes apparent. The impersonal character of the attack on the workman&apos;s real income makes it all the more irritating; he feels that what he has gained with such effort is slipping from his grasp, and, believing that some personal influence must be to blame, suspects conspiracy and accuses the Government of being in league with the profiteer. Again, the only effective remedy is to stop the general rise in prices. Another and more important, though less obvious, cause of unrest is the dislocation of established relations which is inevitable in a time of rising prices. Wages, it has been noted, rise when prices rise ; but they do not rise evenly. The well-organised workers act promptly and secure adequate advances ; the ill-organised have to wait until some enterprising body like the Workers&apos; Union sweeps them into its ranks and puts in a demand for a bonus. In the ranks of the skilled and well-organised workers advances are not uniform, and the normal relations between the wages of different classes and grades of workers are upset. No more certain cause of industrial unrest could be devised. Industrial peace depends on maintaining these relations, which, however lacking in moral or economic justification they may be, have the authority of prescription and are regarded as just. Once they are dislocated, compari-i sons are instituted ; every worker almost can point to someone else who has done better relatively than himself, and is correspondingly disgruntled. And there is no chance that the different classes of workers will settle down to a new set of standard rates, because no standard rate has any stability when prices are moving as extensively as they have done recently.   The rise in prices automatically dislocates every industrial settlement.It is impossible in this place to suggest remedies ; the object has been to show that the continued rise in prices introduces a complication into industrial relations with which no single Ministry can cope. It is conceivable that a continuous adjustment of wages to prices might be arranged ; but there is not at present machinery in existence covering the whole field of industry ; and if there were, it would be extremely difficult to ensure that it functioned uniformly and simultaneously at every crisis, and in any case Labour would resent any suggestion that wages should be based exclusively on the cost of living.A stable currency is the first condition of stable economic relations. The recent abnormal fall in the value of money has synchronised with, and is no doubt connected with, the policy of extensive borrowing by the Government. The prevention of the future rise in prices-and the further Labour unrest which such a rise would inevitably bring with it-cannot therefore be considered apart from the financial policy of the Government. Even if this temporary factor were left out of account, there would seem to be no object more worthy of the Governments immediate attention than the possibility of securing a stable currency. That there is a primd facie case for public inquiry by a commission of experts is shown by the fact that the leading authority on currency questions in the United States, Professor Irving Fisher, has devised a scheme which, he believes, would secure this object. And there are other suggestions current made by lesser authorities. Moreover, the establishment in connection with the League of Nations of a Supreme Economic Council makes easy for the first time international consideration of the problem and international action. The case is one in which inquiry cannot be represented as an attempt to defer action.Part II. Demobilisation and Resettlement.Juveniles : TJie Question of Apprenticeship.The general question of industrial training for juveniles, which during the war fell of necessity into the background, is now attracting in many directions an attention which appears to be augmented to some degree by the Government scheme for enabling* Strikes, it has &quot;been estimated, are most frequent at the turn of the tide, because whereas so long as the tide is rising employers are able more or less to meet workpeople&apos;s demands, but at the turn this ceases to be the case.
apprentices called to the Colours to resume their training. Accredited representatives of associations of employers and trade unions, and also individual employers and trade unionists, when discussing the Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme and Welfare work with officers of the Training Department, have spontaneously raised the question of juvenile training. Evidence is accumulating which discloses, as was to be expected, a state of affairs which cannot but be unsatisfactory in view of the country&apos;s need of skilled workers. The matter is receiving attention not only from the officials of the Ministry of Labour concerned with boy superintendence, but from the Juvenile Employment Committees, and also from the Local Employment Committees, who have in some cases formed special training sub-committees, or equivalent bodies, to take such steps as are possible towards an improvement. The intervention of the State in connection with interrupted apprenticeships seems, in some quarters, to be giving weight to the opinion that the whole question of apprenticeship requires investigation and action on the part of the Government. The character of the training given in Workshops to returned apprentices is an important feature of the scheme, and the allied question of juvenile training has been raised in the conferences dealing with interrupted apprentice-ships. The Joint Industrial Councils, the National Trade Advisory Committee and the ad hoc conferences called by the Training Department in connection with interrupted apprenticeships, recognise the importance of workshop training, not only from the point of view of the returned apprentices, but also of those juveniles apprenticed to specific trades, as well as the position of juveniles in industry generally. The Training Department have been asked to confer with representative bodies of certain industries in regard to the problem of workshop training, and in the case of. the building industry the Department, at the invitation of the Joint Industrial Council, have arranged to supply a secretary to the committee dealing with the question as related to that industry.A few examples may be quoted as evidence of the difficulties which exist in a number of industries over the supply of apprenticed labour. In the printing industry, difficulties have been reported from many quarters. In Leeds it is stated that the scale of apprentices&apos; wages is too low in earlier years to be attractive and that lads prefer either to go into the local textile mills or enter the engineering trades. From Dewsbury a report has been received that the difficulty of obtaining apprentices is becoming acute, in part on account of the lack of a satisfactory uniform rate of wages during apprenticeship, but also because the wages of skilled journeymen are not considered sufficiently high. At Bury and Bolt on, the competition of the cotton mills has serious effects on the supply of printers&apos; apprentices, who see lads much younger than themselves earning higher wages and are in consequence difficult to convince as to the advantages of their trade. Many master printers in Bury have expressed the opinion that State intervention is necessary to develop a scheme for the assistance of their industry, and the suggestion has been put forward that the financial assistance given to apprentices returning from the Forces should be extended also to the younger apprentices who have not served with the Colours. Eeports from various centres of the ironfounding industry put forward similar complaints. In Derby, where boy labour is abundant, ironfounders complain of a difficulty in obtaining apprentices and a shortage greater than that in any other branch of engineering. Eeluctance to accept any system of indentured apprenticeship is attributed mainly to the refusal of parents to face the expense involved in the period of instruction, and it is stated that the lads, who become for the most part learners and not apprentices, rarely complete their training but leave at an early stage to take higher wages on semi-skilled or unskilled work. At Keighley it is stated that the blacksmiths&apos;, coppersmiths&apos; and ironmoulders&apos; trades are becoming depleted of skilled labour owing to the unwillingness of boys to be apprenticed in these less pleasant branches of engineering. In Doncaster, the lure of higher wages in the coal mines is stated to affect adversely apprenticeship in the engineering industry, as few boys will remain sufficiently long to become skilled men when in the mines they can earn over  2 a week at the age of 15 or 16. In the furniture trade the outlook in Birmingham is reported to be equally serious, boys refusing to be indentured because of the rates of wages offered. An appeal has been received from one firm of manufacturers that the Government should take up earnestly the scheme of apprenticeship in this industry. The question is in this instance to be discussed by.the Joint Industrial Council and an attempt made to agree upon an apprenticeship system satisfactory to all parties. In the baking industry in Glasgow, despite payment of wages which are stated to be more than three times the pre-war rate, great difficulty is found in securing apprentices. In this and other large Scottish centres the heavy nature of the work and the increased use of machinery is regarded as largely responsible, the bakeries in most cases recruiting the trade from men who have learnt it in small shops, often in the country, where lighter work is done.  Evidence as to the(C 1877) 2 E 2
prevalence of this difficulty may also be quoted as regards the brashmaking industry, especially in the Swansea district, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and Ashton-under-Lyhej the shortage being attributed generally to the low scale of wages paid before the war in cottse-quence of heavy foreign competition ; and in the coopering industry in Wales, Liverpool and Birmingham. In Wales this latter industry is reported to be dying out as such on account of the lack of apprentices. At Birmingham, it has been ascertained that there is not a single apprentice in the industry. In Liverpool, an apprentice Cooper receives a starting wage of 10s. a week, when by working in the docks he could earn from  2 to  3. Complaints have also been received as to farriery, in Halifax and Other Centres, where it is reported that it is almost impossible to get apprentices on account of the disagreeable nature of the work, and where complaints are also made that the prevalence of Cold shoeing in the Army has caused a great loss of skill in the trade. In Leeds and Gloucester, the shortage Of apprentices in the building trades is stated to involve a very serious outlook for the industry. In Wales, the sailmaking industry is considered to be in danger of extinction from the same cause. An attempt is being made to institute in the pottery trades some system of training and apprenticeship. At present no coherent system exists, and the supply of skilled potters and throwers will one day be exhausted.In some cases the attitude of the trade unions or the workmen themselves is con-sidered to be responsible for this unsatisfactory state of affairs. A firm of wagon wheel and axle makers at Rotherham complain, for example, that the men, who were piece-workers, refuse to have any boys in the shop, and that since the war none have been engaged. A firm of Birmingham screwmakers state that they cannot induce their tool-makers to teach learners or apprentices, except in the case of their own children or near relations, and that some action is necessary if the trade is to be increased or even to continue without a decline. In the watchmaking and jewellery trades in Cardiff and Birmingham the difficulty is stated to lie mainly in the attitude of the employers, who, fOr the mOst part, are in a small Way of business and show reluctance to teach their trade for fear of creating trade rivals. In Birmingham especially the boys employed are kept ( on a limited range of work and never really become skilled hands. A somewhat similar complaint, due in this case to war conditions, comes from the Scottish scientific instrument trade, in Which apprentices are stated to have been confined during the war t6 a f&amp;W operations, and emerge from their pefidd of training as Workers of a poor type.Something is, of course, being done to improve this state of affairs by a number of the larger firms, who elaborate apprenticeship systems for themselves. The trade unions are also, in&apos; some cases; interesting themselves in the matter. But at least in one instance, that of the United Patternmakers&apos;! Association in Liverpool, attention is devoted rathet to the quality of training than to the extension of apprenticeship, and this policy is a consequence of the experience Of the union, who have found that time-expired apprentices who were not qualified workmen tended to become a serious burden on the union. Some steps towards a&apos; solution have also been taken by various Education Committees, by the Local Employment Committees and their Training Sub-Committees, but the situation appears to be one demanding more than partial and local effort. The drift of opinion among the Bury master printers towards State action has already been cited. Similar views have been expressed in the Manchester area by the heads of a number of firms. The Chairman of the Mersey District Committee of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades has recently expressed the opinion that the apprentice question Can only be solved satisfactorily if it is regulated by the State in conjunction with advisory committees of employers and Workers. Finally, a draft report on apprenticeship recently issued by the Belfast District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union suggests that, failing reform by the industry itself, the only remedy is State action.It is possible that a satisfactory line of approach towards the solution of these diffi-cUlties may be found by way of a step recently taken by the Juvenile Branch of the Ministry of Labour. - In fourteen industries the Joint Industrial Councils, or Recon-structlOn Committees, have been approached in order to point out. the desirability of co-operation between these bodies and the Juvenile Employment Committees: It has been suggested that the councils should take into consideration the conditions of employe ment for juveniles, which, in addition to such questions as rates of pay and hours of wOrk; Will naturally include apprenticeship, methods of training and education* The proposal is that a scheme prepared by the Joint Industrial Council in co-operation with the Juvenile Employment Committees and officials of the Ministry of Labour should be recommended to employers throughout the industry, and that in the local operation Of the scheme the Juvenile Employment Committees should play a part. In four cases a decision has still to be reached, but in ten the proposal has been definitely accepted.
-   -      &apos; - Part? IIL-^Press Comments.(1) Labour and Socialist Press., (A) Imperial and Foreign.Mussia.The papers again draw attention to what is considered, the &quot;glaring falsity &quot;of Mr. ChurchilPs statement in the House of Commons that hostilities with Russia are practically at an end. &quot;The Labour Leader&quot; avers that the statement was made purely with the motive of influencing the impending Triple Alliance ballot.on Direct Action. The leading article in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; also deals with this. The attitude towards Russia is the criterion it accepts of the bond fides of individual politicians and of Labour and Socialist organisations. The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is attacked for its support of Mr. Henderson in his candidature for Widnes, owing to the character of his transactions over the Russian mission. The, Second International is condemned for having recognised the Esthonian Republic at a time when that Republic was fighting the Soviet Armies. The issue is stated, to. be between Communism, i.e., international socialism and capitalism. The principle of determining who are and who are not recognised as loyal friends of Labour is that he that is not for Soviet Russia is against true Socialism. The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer&quot; quotes the &quot;Liberator&quot; (U.S.A.) on the revelations of the American &quot; Nation &quot; regarding the mission of Mr. Bullitt and Mr. Steffens, and the fact that the Soviet Government, was prepared to accept the peace proposals of the Allied Governments instead of, as the latter alleged, refusing to cease hostilities. In connection with the American decision to raise the Blockade against Russia, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; remarks that it is hardly probable Allied manufacturers will stand idly by while America gets all the trade, so that some steps to secure their share will probably be taken shortly. &quot; Justice &quot; prints the appeal of the Municipalities and Zemstvos of Northern Russia against the withdrawal of British forces from that area without comment. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; remarks of it that &quot; Churchill simply cannot resist the appeal of the representatives of Commerce and Industry &quot; and hence the recent activity of our troops in Russia.Hungary.The.&quot; New Statesman,&quot; in an article on the general situation in Southern Europe, pays tribute to Mr. Hoover, as the cause of the Archduke ,Joseph&apos;s resignation. It adds, however, that it is thoroughly discreditable to Allied Statesmanship that its blunders and ignorance should have to be counteracted by the energetic and democratic action of an individual. It also finds the obvious.supremacy of America as indicated by this pro-ceeding a disquieting fact, on the grounds, that it is a dominance based on economic superiority and is therefore the outcome of the same democratic conception as prevails in Europe and not of a different and more inspiring one. The &quot; Nation &quot; also gives the credit for the alteration in policy to Mr.. Hoover but does not think that the situation is very materially improved. The &quot;British Citizen,&quot; taking a totally different line, rejoices because the intrigue of the Central Empires to restore the Hapsburg Monarchy has failed, owing to the prompt action.of the Supreme Council in Paris.India.The &quot; Nation,&quot; in a long article under the heading &quot; Whither in India ? &quot; deals with what it considers to be the discrepancy between the attitude towards Indian reform in England and the attitude of the actual administration in India towards every attempt at liberation. It adduces the repressive measures taken in the Punjab and the penalisa-tion of the Press in India as evidence that the worst kind of bureaucracy still prevails. Although the action of the.authorities over the Punjab outbreaks may be excusable on the ground that the country was in&apos; open revolt, the suppression of individual opinion through the medium of the Press is part of the normal working of the system. The article concludes that we cannot claim to have fulfilled our obligations towards India while such . a state of affairs exists, and calls upon the public to seize the opportunity afforded at the moment and to decide upon a future for India consonant with the democratic ideals of a great Imperial Power. The &quot;New Statesman &quot; reviews the work of the Joint Select Committee on the India Bill. It regrets that no announcement has been made on the promised Commission of Inquiry into the state of the Punjab, as a restoration of confidence in Upper India must, it thinks, precede any effective action in the matter of constitutional reform.Persia.The Persian agreement is the subject of some comment. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, writing in &quot; Forward,&quot; asks, if the arrangement was made with the knowledge and consent
of our Allies. The guarantees of the integrity and independence of Persia are in his opinion merely the &quot; official language of annexation &quot; and will deceive nobody. He is concerned at the rapid growth of feeling against Britain in Europe, which he maintains will, be very much aggravated by this latest move in foreign policy. Mr. Seymour Cocks also con-tributes an article on Persia to &quot; Forward.&quot; He gives an historical sketch of negotiations on Persian affairs since about 1890, and is led to substantially the same conclusions as Mr. Macdonald. &quot; Justice &quot; considers the agreement to have been dictated by the British Oil Ring and condemns it as treacherous to Persia, destructive of our good relations with France and a mockery of the League of Nations.Other.The papers contain very little reference to international affairs this week. The Socialist,&quot; however, has a long article on the International Trade Union Congress, by M. H. Sneevliet. In this a comparison drawn between the recent Trade Union Conference and the International Transport Workers&apos; Conference held at Amsterdam in April is very unfavourable to the former. The Trade Union International is said to have been opened on a note of war and no constructive or truly international proposals therefore emanated from it. The writer recalls the speeches of Mr. Robert Williams and Mr. Bevin at the Transport Workers&apos; Conference, and remarks that no such clear call to the nations to make common cause against capitalism occurred at last month&apos;s meeting which was overshadowed by. Mr. Gompers and Mr. Appleton. &quot; The Merthyr Pioneer,&quot; speaking of the Official Labour Conference at Washington, quotes &quot; The Times &quot; correspondent at Tokyo on the prohibition of Trade Unionism in Japan, and adds that the Allied Governments clearly knew what they were about when they invited Japanese labour representatives to attend the Conference, but excluded those of Germany and Russia. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dread-nought &quot; has an account of the recent Swiss General Strike and also a long article dealing with the demonstration strikes in Italy which took place on 21st July, and the views on their success of Serrati, editor of Avanti, and Lazzari, Secretary of the Official Socialist Party. Mertens writes in the &quot; Democrat &quot; on the Trade Union movement in Belgium. Mr. Massingham gives further &quot; Impressions of America &quot; in the &quot; Nation.&quot; He deals this week with the official campaign against personal liberty which grew up during the war. An extraordinarily broad definition of &quot;what constituted sedition has resulted in giving a great impetus to anti-labour agitation generally and especially to the movement against the I.W.W. Mr. Massingham thinks that the American Capitalist Class with far greater powers of organisation show less constructive and conciliatory capacity than our own. They are far removed at present from initiating a scheme similar to our National Industrial Conference, and are apt to think the idea Of a political Labour Party utterly absurd. The &quot;Nation&quot; and the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; and &quot;The Bradford Pioneer &quot; unite in condemning President Wilson&apos;s admissions to the Foreign Relations Committee on the Shantung question. The &quot; Nation &quot; demands an explanation of the transfer to Belgium of Ruanda and Unrundi &quot; over the head &quot; of the League of Nations. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; has a pessimistic article on the economic outlook of Europe generally. This, is said to be so serious that some international distributing agency with power to control and direct supplies is now essential, while the equally grave question of production needs heroic measures if the workers are to consent to increase their output under the existing capitalist system which has lost the confidence of everyone. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; sees some hope in the possibility of the establishment by Germany of a democratic League of Nations in opposition to the Allied League ; but it doubts whether the present German Government is capable of leading a really democratic and anti-militarist move-ment of any kind. Mr. Jowett takes Foreign Policy as the subject of his &quot; Political Notes &quot; in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer.&quot; He advocates the establishment of a Foreign Affairs Com-mittee to which the Foreign Secretary would be responsible, and of similar committees for all the other Departments of State as the most suitable form of check upon Ministers.(B) Home Affairs.Increased Production.The outcome of that part of the Prime Ministers speech which dealt with the gravity of the economic situation, is a crop of articles on the question of increased output and its relation to the well-being of the workers. The &quot; New Age &quot; argues that this remedy unless it results in an organised increase in the production of the necessities of life accom-panied by an equitable system of distribution, will tend rather to aggravate than to cure the disease from which society is suffering. Increased production under the existing capitalist system will result in an increase in the cost of living of the wage-earning class, because it will operate to reduce the purchasing value of fixed wages and salaries.  The
common error is to suppose that increased production implies better distribution, whereas the converse is the case, and once a fair system of distribution is guaranteed production will increase as a master of course. Sir Leo Chiozza Money, writing in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; declares that the issue is confused by bringing in the &quot; bogey &quot; of American competition as an inducement to British workers to produce more. He does not deny the need for the. rapid reorganisation of industry in the national interest, but opposes the introduction of trade &quot; scares &quot; to mislead the workers. He urges the Government to resume the control of industry which was beneficially exercised during the war &quot; instead -of merely talking about production in short, the Government should produce.&quot; Several writers emphasise the futility of calling upon the working-classes to produce more under a system of private ownership and profit-making. T-hus the &quot; Call&quot; ironically remarks on the reappearance of &quot; our old friend, increased production.&quot; &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; considers that until the confidence of the workers is restored on this point no real headway will be made in the improvement of an extraordinarily grave outlook. The leading article in &quot; Justice &quot; and also an article by Robert Arch on the economic doctrines of Mr. Harold Cox urge the same point eliminate private profit by means of the socialisation of industries, and the problem of output will cease to exist. Diminution of output is directly due to the working of the capitalist system, which does not for obvious reasons call out the best impulses in those who work under it. It also occurs as a direct result of the fear of unemployment, since the system creates an unvarying cycle over-production, glut, depression, unemployment. The &quot; Democrat,&quot; which takes a different line of argument, has no less than nine articles on the subject of output. These all have as their text the exhortation to the worker to produce more. One writer urges that ^as the rise of prices is wholly based on a shortage of goods, increased production will immediately eliminate the profiteer; another that since it is caused by increase in the cost of production, and since to raise the level of wages is to increase this cost, therefore it is more to the advantage of the worker to concentrate on keeping prices down, both by the negative method of not. seeking an increased wage, and by the positive one of producing more goods, than to try to meet a continually higher standard of living brought about largely by his own ignorance. American competition, the relation of import to export trade and the perilous nature of an extremist labour policy as they affect the -question of production, form the subjects of the other articles. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; has a leading article in the same strain, but demands that a fairer system of distribution be adopted. Mr. A. M. Thompson, writing in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; appeals to the forthcoming Trades Union Congress to consider Mr. Brownlie&apos;s letter on the economic position, not :as a party issue, but seriously in the light of the grave facts which caused it to be written.-Profiteering and High Prices.This week&apos;s press comments on the &quot; Profiteering Act&quot; are all unfavourable except in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; which maintains its belief that the scheme is a good one, -although time would doubtless lead to improvements in detail. The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; considers it to be purely a &quot; window dressing &quot; affair arranged to gain popularity for the Government without the intention to effect any real reform. The &quot; Call&quot; is sceptical about the good intentions in this direction of a Parliament which threw out the Labour Party Bill giving trading powers to municipalities. The &quot; Democrat&quot; quotes Mr. Runciman&apos;s speech at Alnwick professing no faith in a hasty measure to deal with so complicated a question, and joins with him in declaring that nothing will lower prices but increased production whereby our export trade will recover, and the present shortage of goods be removed. All the papers which deal with this subject note that the Act has been followed by an increase in the prices of milk and other staple articles, ;and imply that this is not a promising beginning to its career.. Nationalisation:The &quot; New Age &quot; gives an analysis of Sir Arthur Duckham&apos;s scheme and the reasons for treating it unfavourably. With regard to the significance of the Governments present policy over the nationalisation of the mines it inclines to the view that the object is to produce a deadlock The miners cannot gain by this and capital may at all events, it will gain time. In an article in the &quot; Call&quot; Mr. Frank Tanner says that the choice before the miners is action or defeat, and that they must make it immediately. The &quot;Clarion&apos;s &quot; leading article is very largely taken up with this question. It deprecates the forcing of the issue by a general miners&apos; strike, but strongly supports their claim, and contains personal eulogies of Mr. Smillie, Mr. Hartshorn and other prominent miners&apos; leaders. In a few comments on the present position &quot;Forward&quot; suggests that the financial situation may really be such that the Government cannot embark on nationalisation.
The importance of accurate knowledge to decide this jn place of the purely doctrinaire or extremist assumptions everywhere being advanced is emphasised. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; gives a critical analysis of the pamphlet recently issued by the South Wales Socialist Society as a sequel to the &quot; Miners&apos; Next Step.&quot;* &quot;The scheme although welcomed as a contribution to the problem is declared to have the inevitable defects of an attempt to &quot; graft a sprig of Socialism on to the Capitalist trunk.&quot; It starts from the top and not.as all socialistically sound schemes should, from the bottom, with the result that its electoral arrangements are too bureaucratic, and the control of the rank and file is not real in spite of sincere endeavours to make it so.The Political Outlook.The contest at Widnes forms the subject of most of the political matter. The &quot; Labour-Leader &quot; is not inclined to welcome the Liberal support given openly to Mr. Henderson, and implied in the omission of the Liberal Party to put up a candidate for Swansea, Both well or Pontefract. In so far as this avoids a three-cornered contest which probably would mean a Coalition victory, it is a gain to the Labour Party, but it is pointed out that the Liberal Party must not hope for any return in kind, as Labour is bent on forming: a large political party on an independent programme. A leading article on the election prospects declares that Mr. Henderson&apos;s victory would greatly increase the prestige of the Labour Party and its chances at subsequent by-elections, but a certain lack of confidence in Mr. Henderson as a Parliamentarian is not concealed. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; also criticises the poor spirit shown by the free Liberals in their by-election policy. Mr. Fenner Brockway writes on the general political situation in the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer.&quot; He expresses the hope that Mr. Henderson will be returned for Widnes, but asks when Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and Mr. Snowden will be once more in Parliament.Industrial Situation. .     ;The &quot; New Statesman&quot; has a special article on the main issues before the Trades Union Congress. The two principal subjects for debate are expected to be the Nationalisa-tion of the Coal Mines and Profiteering. The writer suggests that it is in connection with these matters and not with Russia or Conscription that &quot; Direct Action &quot; will be most keenly discussed. He does not anticipate that any Trade Union will demur to this measure when the issue is a definitely industrial one. The article concludes with a criticism of the Congress as a disappointing body which should devote more thought to-its executive functions and to the provision of a stronger secretariat if it is to give the British Trade Union movement the effective leadership which it needs. Mr. J. T/Walton Newbold, in a contribution to the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; gives his opinion that capitalism is anxious to throw the blame for the economic ruin which is prophesied for the country upon Labour, and by dividing the workers against each other, smash the Labour movement. altogether. In the &quot; Socialist&quot; appears an article on &quot;The Minimum Wage Fallacy &quot; inspired by the Prime Ministers announcement that a Commission of Inquiry into the question of a national minimum wage is to be appointed. The writer declares that the principle of a minimum wage is unsound from the workers&apos; point of view, while it offers advantages to the employer, and that even if it were immediately beneficial to the worker it must be regarded in its true character as another &quot; gag &quot; to keep Labour quiet just when the opportunity for its final effort is at hand.Other.The absence of any outstanding event of importance during the week accounts perhaps -for the rather large number of articles of a purely theoretical character. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, both in &quot; Forward &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; urges the, need for unity and for adherence to fundamentals in the Labour movement. Mr. John MacLean writing in the &quot; Call &quot; and Mr. Arthur MacManus in the &quot; Socialist,&quot; discuss Revolutionary Socialism and its chances in England at the present time. The latter states incidentally in his article &quot;the filthiest job which a revolution imposes upon a. revolutionary becomes sanctified and made clean by the purpose of the revolution, and likewise distasteful and repulsive opinions are ennobled when they become duties of the revolution.&quot; Mr. Fairchild continues his controversy on &quot;Parliamentarism and Trade Unionism&quot; in the &quot; Call.&quot; The &quot; Clarion &quot; has a long artiole on &apos;.&apos; Direct Action &quot; which it opposes as the antithesis-of democracy. Ex-Inspector Syme writes in &quot; Forward &quot; protesting against the innuendo in Mr. Ramsay Macdonald&apos;s reference to the W. F. Watson case last week. He contends that the use of Alec Gordon&apos;s name coupled with that of Watson was an insult to the*;&quot; Industrial Democracy for Miners.  A Plea for the Democratic Control of the Mining Industry,&apos;.&apos; ,
Part IV. General Topics and District Reports. (1) General Topics.Nationalisation.The Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain met in London on the 2nd inst. and passed the following resolution, which was unanimously approved by the delegate conference which sat on the following day : &quot; Being convinced that the Government^ scheme is wholly impracticable for the future working of the mines, the executive committee recommends the con-ference of miners&apos; delegates to reject the Government scheme, and records its regret that the Government has no better scheme than the creation of great trusts to secure the economic well-being of the industry.&quot; We are convinced that the only way to place the industry upon a scientific basis for the purpose of giving the advantage of a maximum production to the community consistent with the maximum economic and social well-being of the miners, is at once to introduce the scheme of nationalisation recommended by the majority of the Coal Industry Commission.&quot; We do not at this stage recommend the miners to take industrial action to secure the adoption of the Coal Commission report, but we invite the Trades Union Congress to declare that the fullest and most effective action be taken to secure that the Government shall adopt the majority report of the Corn-mission as to the further governance of the industry.&quot;This resolution may be regarded as a victory, in the meantime at least, for the con-stitutional party within the Federation. It is well known that a strong section of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain is in favour of urging immediate direct action on the nationalisation issue ; and it is evident from the terms of the resolution that this section has, for the present at any rate, been defeated. It should be noted, however, that Mr. Smillie, in his speech on the 3rd inst., insisted that the resolution did not indicate that the miners would be asked to abandon the weapon of direct action if they felt it to be necessary. Thus it would, perhaps, be truer to say that the resolution represents a corn-promise. This is suggested by the proposal in the resolution that the Trade Union Congress should declare that the &quot; fullest and most effective action &quot; should be taken.. Such a phrase indicates compromise par excellence, for it may mean anything from the most revolutionary industrial action to the most constitutional political action.   But&apos;   (C 1877) 2 Flatter who has not yet been given a chance to defend himself. It would be better if Labour leaders attacked the system which allows such a situation to arise at all. Several of the papers have a reference to the Prime Ministers letter on the need for economy in State Departments, the &quot; New Statesman &quot; speaks of it as the &quot; latest stunt &quot; and declares that it does not expect much real economy to be effected by such theatrical and superficial methods. It welcomes the re-organisation of the Treasury, however; as a much-needed, reform which promises to be carried out with discrimination.(2) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Government Scheme for Training Disabled Soldiers.The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; of 28th August summarises some objections to the Govern-ment scheme as it applies to the Engineering Trades, which were put forward at a special, meeting of the Birmingham No. 12 Branch of the A.S.E. The union considers that at the end of three years&apos; training the men. will be placed in an unfair position in the labour market. The union could not regard them as fully trained, although the Government and the employers might, and they would therefore not have the protection of the union. Another objection made is that it is a mistake to introduce fresh men. into the trade while approximately 5,000 members of the A.S.E. are out of employment and thousands more awaiting release from the Army.Some comments on the anticipated Royal Proclamation requiring employers to employ a certain percentage of disabled men appear in the &quot; Daily News.&quot; 3rd September. One engineering employer stated that he considered 5 per cent, a very large proportion in an industry where strength and vigour are essential, and where the men will require so much training. Another expressed the opinion that the State should compensate the employer in cases where the men&apos;s disablement reduces their normal capacity.
when a spirit of compromise is displayed, the tendency to adopt extreme measures subsequently is usually weakened.Trades Union Congress.The fifty-first annual Trades Union Congress, which will commence its sittings at Glasgow on the 8th September, will have a very full agenda. Resolutions in favour of the nationalisation of land, mines, railways, shipping and banking are submitted by the Agricultural Labourers&apos; and Rural Workers&apos; Union, the A.S.L.E. and F., the R.C.A., the Ship Constructors&apos; and Shipwrights&apos; Association, and the Dock, Wharf and Riverside Workers&apos; Union. An emergency resolution will also probably be framed in accordance with the resolution passed by the Executive of the M.F.G.B. on the 2nd inst. The Ware-house and General Workers&apos; Union advocates the establishment of &quot; a real Industrial Parliament of Labour &quot; to co-ordinate the claims put forward in Labour&apos;s name through the machinery of the existing Industrial Councils, and to enable the Trade Union movement to adopt, on all questions of national and international importance, a common policy. Various resolutions are submitted dealing with the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, the Fair Wages Clause, the Factory and Workshops Act, and the National Health Insurance Act. There are also resolutions, on the usual lines, in favour of the establishment of May Day, the raising of the Income-Tax exemption limit to  250, the repeal of the Military Service Acts, the reinstatement of conscientious objectors, the recognition of the Police Union, the granting of holidays with pay, and the adoption of a national working week of 44 hours. Two resolutions advocate the compulsory undertaking of adequate housing schemes by local authorities for their own areas. The only resolution in favour of a levy upon capital stands in the name of ,the National Cigar Makers&apos; Union, The United Garment Workers&apos; Union submits a resolution protesting against the arrest and deportation of alien TraeJe Union officials on the ground of their alleged connection with Bolshevism. Many other resolutions, dealing with questions affecting miners, seamen, teachers and others., will occupy the attention of the Congress.Discharges and Unemployment.There seems to be some prospect that serious difficulty may arise from unemployment consequent upon the sudden orders of the Government to cease work on naval and other contracts. The unrest due.to this cause is most serious at Barrow, where it is reported that the suspension of Government work will mean the discharge of two or three thousand hands from Vickers. There is apparently no immediate prospect of alternative work being found for these men, who have now to draw out-of-work donation, and under these cir-cumstances they are becoming restive, especially in view of the present rising prices. The local committee at Barrow has appointed two delegates to make representations in London, and it is reported that the Boilermakers are considering the question of taking action in sympathy. Reports from other districts, mentioned in the second section of this part of the Report, indicate that a considerable amount of unemployment will result from discharges at Plymouth and on the Clyde, and a less amount on the North-East Coast; and that in some cases the local absorption of the men will present great difficulties. In general, there is evidence that even where men thrown out of employment by the sudden cancellation of Admiralty orders are speedily absorbed in other work, the sudden nature of their enforced change of work causes a very considerable amount of ill-feeling and unrest, and it may be suggested that unless the policy of the Government with regard to the sudden stoppage of contracts is modified, seeds of trouble will be sown which may produce results wholly out of proportion to the actual immediate extent of the dislocation of labour.Labour and Production.There are signs that the gravity of the economic situation of the country due to the decrease in production is being realised by Labour, which is apparently beginning to awake to a realisation of the responsibilities that its great power implies. Manifestations of this responsible attitude were provided during the week by the decisions, mentioned elsewhere in this Report, of the conf tience of the M.F.G.B. not to advocate industrial action in the meantime to enforce nationalisation, and of the joint conference in the engineering and shipbuilding trades to postpone the workers&apos; claim for a 44-hour week till the probable economic effects of its introduction should be investigated, and by the agreement in the woollen textile industry, in which the workpeople&apos;s representatives engage to use their endeavours with a view to every effort being made to increase output.  And individual
trade union leaders have been advocating the necessity of increasing output. In this connection, much interest was aroused by the letter written on the 27th August by Mr. J. T. Brownlie, Chairman of the Executive Council of the A.S.E., to Mr. C. W. Bowerman, Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. In this letter Mr. Brownlie draws attention to the serious economic condition of the country, and suggests that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, as the most representative and responsible body of trade unionists in the country, should take action with a view to alleviating the situation. It is.expected that at the Trades Union Congress in Glasgow next week some definite proposal with regard to the question of production will be made ; but it may be suggested that any such proposal will involve some reference to the problem of the control of industry and the status of the workpeople. The extent of the interest at present being taken in this question in Labour circles may to a certain extent be gauged by the prominence which it assumes this week in the Labour and Socialist Press. (See: Part III of this Report.)Shipbuilding and Engineering.A joint conference of delegates of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Employers&apos;&apos; Federations and the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation and the Amal-gamated Society of Engineers was held in London on the 28th August to consider the recommendation of the recent conference of the men&apos;s unions for the appointment of a committee to investigate &quot; the economic effect of a 44-hour week throughout the eagineer-ing and shipbuilding industries, having regard to methods of production and foreign competition.&quot; (See Report for 13th August.) At the conference it was mutually agreed to recommend to the constituent bodies : (1) That the working conditions on a 47-hour week should be adjusted with the least possible delay ; (2) That a joint committee, representative of the employers and the unions&apos; Negotiating Committee, be appointed to investigate the economic relation of production to hours of work, and in this connection the methods of manufacture in the shipbuilding and engineering industries in this and other countries ; (3) That meantime the application for a reduction of hours to 44 per week is adjourned ; (4) That the chairman of the Joint Investigation Committee shall be a member of the committee, and, alternatively, a representative of the employers and a representative of the unions&apos; Negotiating Committee. This decision is of great significance as it indicates the willingness of both employers and workers to take into consideration the welfare of the industry as a whole, and not merely the sectional advantages of elements within it. The moderate and responsible attitude which the workers&apos; re-presentatives have adopted throughout the whole course of these negotiations, which have more than once threatened to reach a deadlock, shows signs of leading to the exhibition of the same spirit in negotiations in other industries.Electrical Trades.It is reported that the Executive of the Electrical Trades Union are circulating to the branches and district committees the considered policy of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association in contemporary trades and labour disputes, as set forth in a special circular. The &quot; policy,&quot; in the first place, pledges members of the E.P.E.A. to make every endeavour to maintain continuity of supply where members of other trade unions, strike, &quot; with the object of coercing members of the E.P.E.A.&quot; Secondly, the members pledge themselves to the same course until the executive shall decide on a line of action in cases where either party has failed to carry out an award or agreement, &amp;c. Thirdly, in all cases of disputes or strikes, where &quot; constitutional methods &quot; have been adopted and failed, the Divisional Emergency Committee will instruct members of the E.P.E.A. to carry out their normal duties only. This is, of course, the latest move in an old standing feud between the Power Engineers and the E.T.U. who cover a considerable number of power engineers, especially those who have risen from the ranks, and claim that they should cover this occupation completely, i.e., that the E.P.E.A. is usurping their ground.Woollen Textile Industry.The agreement which has been arrived at with regard to wages, &amp;c, between the employers&apos; representatives of the manufacturing sections of the Northern Counties District Council of the National Wool (and Allied) Textile Industrial Council on the one hand, and the representatives of the Trade Unions concerned on the other, is of special interest for two reasons.. In the first place, it provides machinery for the raising or lowering of &quot; the cost of living wage &quot; in accordance with the changes in the cost of living announced in the &quot; Labour Gazette.&quot;  The August wage for time-workers is recommended(C1877) 2 F2
to consist of &quot; basic wage, 100 parts ; advanced basic wage 10 parts, cost of living wage 107 parts.&quot; As the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; for August, 1919, announced the cost of living index number as 115, the &quot; cost of living wage &quot; from the first pay day in September will be 115 parts. It is provided that if the cost of living index number reaches 125, the cost of living wage will be 125 parts ; if it decreases to 105, the cost of living wage will be 105, and so on. In the second place, the agreement is significant because of the insertion of a clause which states : &quot; These advances are to be paid conditionally on every effort being made to increase the output and efficiency of the industry, and that the workpeople&apos;s representatives will use their endeavour to that end.&quot; How far the latter provision will be of any real effect remains to be seen. The arrangement whereby wages are based partly on the cost of living, it may be noted, is in force in the bleaching and dyeing trades and there has given rise to a considerable amount of dispute as to the interpretation to be put upon the figures. It may be mentioned, also, that in the cotton trade the conference of the Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association, at its meeting on the 2nd inst., was not in favour of a proposal that wages should vary with the cost of living.Ex-Service Men&apos;s Organisations.   .There is much dissatisfaction in the ranks of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers with regard to the action of its National Executive Committee. This dissatisfaction has crystallised into the holding of an unofficial conference by the rebellious branches at Southport. The conference was attended by representatives of about 100.000 members of the Federation, who maintain that the National Executive Committee by its action in raising the affiliation fees of local branches from 10 per cent, to 25 per cent, of the annual subscriptiors has disfranchised something like 500 branches and 882,000 of the total of a million members claimed by the Federation. The result of this, it is stated, was to restrict the recent Manchester conference to a small minority which, though legal and constitutional, was undemocratic. One consequence of the unrepresenta-tive nature of the Manchester conference was that it decided in favour of opening member-ship to all officers, a matter on which the rebellious branches have strong convictions.Ex-Service Men&apos;s Grievances.The Ex-Service Men&apos;s Clerical Association have forwarded a resolution to the Prime Minister requesting him to secure that&apos;before any ex-Service men are discharged from Government Departments every person who has not served in His Majesty&apos;s Forces be demobilised, irrespective of the position he has held during the war. Ealing and Hanwell branches of the .N.F.D.D.S.S. have passed a resolution calling on the Prime Minister to obtain situations in Government offices for unemployed ex-Service men to replace some of the 169,000 women stated to be still employed. A deputation from the Comrades of the Great War and the N.F.D.D.S.S. recently waited upon the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, pointed out that some 2,000 ex-Service men are unemployed there, and requested that some of these should be substituted for girls in all Corporation Departments. The local branch of the N.F.D.D.S.S. at Wakefield maintains that much of the unemployment among ex-Service men there is due to the fact that there are married women working as clerks, &amp;c, in the district.Out-of-Work Donation.The new scales of out-of-work donation payable to ex-Service men, the widows of ex-Service men, and the guardians of their children have been published.Piece-Work.At a conference of the National Federation of General Workers at York on the 29th August, a resolution was passed that when systems of payment by results are operative, arrangements shall be made for its application to all workers in the shop or department, and that after each workman has received an amount representing his weekly draw of wages there shall be an equal distribution of the remaining amount left in a common pool. *Trade Union Topics.The branches of the Insurance Agents&apos; Union at Blaengwynfi, Glamorgan, are protesting against full-time miners acting as spare-time insurance collectors after finishing-colliery work.A branch of the Bar Assistants&apos; Union has been formed at Burnley.It is stated that large numbers of Army Pay Corps clerks in Nottingham, most of whom are demobilised soldiers, have joined the local branch of the National Union of Clerks, to obtain better conditions of work.
Federation of British Industries.The Education Committee of the Federation of British Industries has issued a report on Compulsory Continued Education under the Education Act of 1918. It makes a strong recommendation that the interest of employers in the educational development of their employees should be maintained, since the most effective intimate co-operation between educationists, employers and employees is the only method by which the greatest good can be derived by scholars and students from the education system. After dis-cussing various possible arrangements for carrying out the provisions of the Education Act, it recommends that classes, unless in exceptional circumstances, should be held on two half-days or one whole day per week, the former for preference, and that the curriculum in the first place should be of a general educational nature, with due regard to the value of vocational illustrations. There should in the later stages be a development of those subjects which bear most closely on the work of the young person. Firms should help to meet their young employees&apos; loss of wages consequent upon their attendance at educa-tional courses, but this should depend on satisfactory efforts being made by the young persons to make the most of their educational courses.Britannic Industrial Alliance.This organisation has been formed to bring together all associations of employers and employees in this country which are working harmoniously in Joint Industrial Councils, and also organisations and individuals interested in developing British trade and British markets, with a view to placing them in direct touch with similar organisations&apos; and individuals in the Dominions and Colonies. Its general purpose is &quot; to promote co-operation and industrial harmony with a view to developing the Empire&apos;s resources and furthering the cause of Empire unity.&quot; Mr. J. Havelock Wilson, M.P., has been appointed chairman of the Provisional Committee, and among the members of the Com mittee are Sir Robert Home, Mr. G. N. Barnes, Mr. G. H. Roberts and Mr. J. R. dynes.Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.This Federation, whose formation has recently been announced, is reported to include practically all the leading firms in Great Britain which contract for the con-struction of large public works and similar undertakings. It is stated that one of. the functions which the Federation is intended to perform is the promotion of clearer under-standings with Labour, and with a view to this the firms included in the Federation look forward to the establishment of a Joint Industrial Council. Viscount Cowdray is the president of the Federation.Court of Arbitration.During the week ending 30th September, 1919, the Court heard 24 cases 20 in London and 4 in Dublin.Joint Industrial Councils.Electricity Supply.. A conference of about 250 representatives of electricity supply undertakings in Cumberland, Westmorland, Lancashire, Cheshire and North Wales, and of the Trade Unions concerned, was held at the Town Hall, Manchester, on the 19th August. It was unanimously resolved that a District Council be formed, and the representatives of the two sides of the Council were elected. The first meeting of the Council will be held at an early date for the purpose of dealing with basic rates of wages, &amp;c.Needles and Fish-hooks. The Joint Industrial Council, met at Redditch on the 19th August. The most important subject of discussion concerned the employment of disabled soldiers. The Trade Union representatives made it clear that, provided disabled men-were not used as unfair competitors to repress wages, they wished to do all they could to facilitate their employment. Both sides agreed that-(a) the remuneration of a disabled man should be fixed independently of his disablement pension, and (b) where a disabled man cannot earn a full wage, the deficiency should be made good by the State. Objection was taken by speakers on both sides to a scheme suggested by the Training Department on the ground that certain of the processes in which this scheme proposes to train disabled men are not such as can suitably be performed by them. The attitude of other Joint Industrial Councils towards the scheme is referred to in Part II of this Report.Road Transport. A meeting of the Executive Committee of the Joint, Industrial Council was held on 20th August. The Committee, after disposing of other business, discussed the congestion of road transport in certain centres, and a committee was appointed to see Sir Norman Hill, with a view to formulating a scheme for facilitating road transport in congested areas.
Vehicle BuiUing.-k meeting of the Joint Industrial Council was held in Birmingham on the 18th August to endeavour to arrive at a wage agreement to replace the agreement ex-piring on 31st July. Several previous attempts to arrive at a national agreement had failed, but this meeting was faced with a threat from the Scottish employers to withdraw from the Council unless such anagreement was reached. Eventually the Council arrived at an agree-ment providing for the concession of Id. per hour increase all round, with rates of Is. Sd. and Is. S\d. for specified provincial hours and Is. 9d. for London. The agreement is to be submitted to the constituents for ratification, the Trade Unions taking a ballot of members on the point.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastem.Unemployment. A reduction of 2,000 has occurred in the live register during the week.Resettlement. Building is reported to be delayed owing to the high cost of materials, transport difficulties and shortage of labour. Dry timber is difficult to obtain, also white lead for paints. Road work is being impeded by a shortage of tarred slag. The difficulty, it is stated, might be overcome by supplies of tarred granite macadam being obtained from firms who are able to deliver, provided transport can be arranged.General. Labour conditions may be regarded as satisfactory with the exception of the disturbed state of the building trade. Evidence is accumulating that points to the recognition both by employers and workpeople of the serious position in which the country finds itself on account of reduced output, and it is hoped that hostilities will be avoided and a joint endeavour made to meet what is a national emergency.South 3Iidlands and Eastern.Unemployment. A decrease, amounting to nearly 2,300, has occurred in the live register.Resettlement. Shortage of fuel, which appears to be due mainly to difficulties of transport and partly to insufficient supplies, is having an adverse effect on resettlement Further discharges have been rendered necessary at Northampton and Wellingborough owing to shortage of coal.General. The situation presents few noticeable features. In the lace and curtain trade at Nottingham the rather extravagant demands of the Workers&apos; Union are for the mpment in abeyance.The blast furnaces in the Wellingborough district, which were out of blast during the coke and coal shortage, were put in full blast again at the beginning of last week.South Western.Unemployment. A small decrease of 1,000 is reported in the live register.ResettlemenL-Tllie Bristol Housing Extension and Town Planning Committee have received an estimate of  3,000,000 for 5,000 houses. The tenders showed a. cost of  1,000 per house with a parlour and three bedrooms.Demobilisation is proceeding at the Worthy Down Aerodrome, Winchester. The Army Pay Department have discharged a large number of women clerks. The demobilisa-tion of the W.R.A.F. at Chattis Hill and the discharge of women from H.M.. Factory, Longparish, have placed a large number of women on the live register.The Devon Small Holdings Committee report that 265 ex-Service applicants have been approved for 5,913 acres, and 266 other applicants for 5,088 acres. So far, 3,628 acres have been, purchased.The plans in connection with the housing scheme at Basingstoke have been passed. &apos;General-Tlie labour situation is satisfactory. No disputes or strikes are reported in the Southampton area, and in the Bristol area no changes have occurred.The discharge of workers from the National dockyards is likely, to affect Plymouth to the extent of about 200 men per week. This is looked upon as a serious matter, as there are few openings where these men can be absorbed. ,West Midlands.Unemployment. For the first time since the end of March the returns show an increase in the number of persons unemployed.  The increase is confined to men and juveniles.
Among men the increase of 349 is largely due to the trouble in the furnishing trade and to discharges from the Siddeley Deasy Motor Car Co., Ltd. In the case of juveniles the increase of 588 is due to the occurrence of the school-leaving period.Resettlement. The shortage of railway trucks at Stourbridge continues. Messrs. John Hall &amp; Son have been four days without trucks, and in consequence of the accumula-? tion of fireclay products they will be compelled to suspend a large number of their employees. A large firm of hardware manufacturers are experiencing great difficulty in getting goods to the ports. Another firm complain of the constant blockage on the line between London and Liverpool.Messrs. Robert Heath &amp; Sons, Ltd., Stoke-on-Trent, who employ 2,000 hands, are expecting to increase this number by 20 per cent. The Tarmac Co., Wolverhampton, are soon to erect works adjoining those of Messrs. Heath for the manufacture of tarmac, which will give employment to 300 people.General. Little change has occurred in the industrial position. Mr. J. T. BrownhVs letter on the necessity for increased production has received much favourable attention in the public press, but in Labour circles its reception has been of a mixed character. The announcement of a new programme of wages and conditions for the railwaymen has received little notice yet, but discussions on the subject are to be held this week in various branches of the union. . xYorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. Owing to the settlement of the coal strike a decrease of 2,500 has occurred in the live register. Firms are rapidly getting back into working order, and the live register should gradually decrease until all those thrown out of work by the strike have been reabsorbed.Resettlement. The congestion of timber at the Hull docks has been slightly remedied, as more wagons have become available. If the supply of wagons could be kept up for a fortnight the congestion would be greatly diminished.General. The difference between employers and workers in the cutlery trade in Sheffield has now reached a very acute stage ; the result of the ballot is reported to be a big majority in favour of a strike.North-Western.Unemployment. A decrease of. 6,000 has occurred in the live register. Every Exchange in the area reports a reduction.Resettlement. Shortage of joiners is hindering building schemes at St. Helens. At the Eccleston Garden Suburb the workshop, railways and sidings are under construction for the erection of 486 of the 5,000 houses to be built on the site. No difficulty is expected in obtaining supplies of material, though shortage of skilled labour is feared.General-The general position is very much quieter than it has been for several months. Particularly is this the case in Liverpool, where there are now no strikes remaining. Dissatisfaction exists, however, on a large scale among discharged soldiers owing to the scheme of training provided for them not developing as rapidly as they wished. The arrangements for a march to London of several thousand men have been modified, and if the demonstration does eventually take place it will not consist of a larger number than 50 selected representatives.Northern.Unemployment. The numbers unemployed have decreased by 1,200 during the week. Small increases in the live register occurred at Jarrow, Middlesbrough, South Shields and Whitehaven.Resettlement. Messrs. W. Benson &amp; Sons, Ltd., Fourstones, cannot get del very of bolts for tubs used at their mines. This is causing tubs to stand idle. Shortage of ships&apos; plates is retarding output at Blyth, Willington Quay and Sunderland. At Willington Quay shortage of riveters is reported. Several squads of riveters are also required at Sunclerland, where the shortage of this type of labour is said to be due to lack of housing accommodation. At Shildon and Walkergate a shortage of woodworkers is reported. The North Eastern Railway Co.&apos;s wagon works have 1,700 wagons awaiting repairs.General. The situation remains very quiet, and there are distinct signs that the legitimate and more reasonable type of labour leaders are regaining more authority, owing to the various defeats which the extremist section have lately suffered.   It is not
likely that there will be much dislocation of labour in consequence of the new Admiralty order, as work on the majority of Admiralty vessels has been gradually suspended since the beginning of the year, and the stoppage of the few remaining contracts will not seriously affect the labour position.Scotland.Unemployment. A small decrease of 235 in the live register is reported. Unemploy-ment in Edinburgh is chiefly among warehousemen, rubber workers, butchers and barmen.&apos; An improvement is shown as regards&apos;general labourers. The live register still remains high at Kilmarnock, especially among turners, clerks, hosiery workers and general labourers. At Barrhead 200 men are going on short time. At Motherwell 60 men have been discharged by the Motherwell Bridge Go., and the Lanarkshire Steel Co. are suspending men through lack of orders.Resettlement. At Inverness a large unsatisfied demand exists in the building trades for skilled workmen. A hat and cap factory, which was expected to be started at Barrhead, is delayed owing to the lack of electrical power. At Ayr, delay in the delivery of steel is causing unemployment in the shipbuilding industry. Owing to lack of houses the Sanquhar and Kirkeonnel Collieries, Ltd.; are unable to fill vacancies for 4.00 miners.General. The general situation may be considered satisfactory. Considerable alarm prevailed among industrial workers engaged on Admiralty contracts when cancellation was announced. A careful analysis, however, disclosed a more satisfactory position than was at first expected, and the numbers to be dismissed will be relatively small. It is only in the upper reaches of the Clyde that the effect is really felt, and it is hoped that workers temporarily suspended will speedily be absorbed in yards where non-Admiralty work is in progress.Wales.Unemployment. No change has occurred in the live register. Unemployment is stil serious at Merthyr owing to the dispute at the works of Messrs. Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds Ltd., and the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Company.Resettlement. Plans for 100 houses at Newport have been approved and tenders are being obtained.The Reliance Fuel Co., Ltd., Llanelly, have purchased from the Llanelly Harbour Trust, 3 acres for the erection of a factory for the manufacture of briquettes and smokeless fuel. The company guarantee to ship 8,000 tons per week. Owing to the diminished output of the South Wales coalfield, the Cardiff and other docks are filled with ships waiting for coal.   Several ships have had to leave in ballast.General. Broadly viewed, the industrial situation may be described as satisfactory ; small disputes occur, but are restricted in origin and limited in scope. The question of output in the coal industry is engaging serious attention, and throughout the industrial area in South Wales a definite attempt is evident to create machinery for negotiation and conciliation in each industry. Anti-foreign feeling has been expressed by a resolution passed by the employees at the British Mannesmann Tube Works, Swansea, to the effect that they are not prepared to work if any German, Austrian, Hungarian, or ex-enemy is employed.Part V. Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work,Coal Miners.Durham. Some 1,500 miners employed at the Hebburn Colliery Co. ceased work on 1st September owing to a dispute concerning &quot; cavilling,&quot; i.e., the drawing of lots for places in which to work during a certain period of time.Scotland.
