n -1I-in I0.&apos; ornmerity.4 i IWAR CABINET.PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AERIAL ROUTE FROM CAIRO TO KARACHI. I MEMORANDA!.! BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR AND AIR.1.        1The Air Council have re Gently had under consideration tho necessity for the early establishment of stratogic air routes throughout the Empire.   Of such routes the most important at tho present juncture alike on  political and military grounds is&apos; the route between Egypt and India, via Mesopotamia, a preliminary survoy of which has already been made in the course of the two successful f li$ifcs to India accomplished some months since.   These flights however were of a pioneer, experimental nature,, and, if the route is to bo made permanently available for tho movomdnts of aircraft on a large scale, it Is essontir.1 that tho construction of certain works at the more important stations should be undertaken forthwith.2. The proposed expenditure of  100,000 for those purposeshas&quot; boon the subject of correspondence between the Air Ministry and the Treasury who think that a decision of tho VJar Cabinet should first bo obtained on the question of the strength to be maintained in the East as part of the Defences of -Egypt, Palestine and Syria, Mesopotamia and India.   Tho Treasury furthdr su?? ost that before any work of construction is under-taken- tho question of the incidence of cost as between the various Governments concerned should bo takon up with tho -India Officeand foreign ^ Office.   A copy of the last letter received fro;-&apos;, tho Trorvniry is.appended to this Memorandum.I would strongly doprocate any proposal to delay tho preparation&apos;of the air route from Cairo to Karachi for either -of the roasons&quot;suggested by tho Treasury.   It is not yet practicable to determine the permanent establishment of the Royal Air Force in India or the Middle Eastj and though the question of the incidence of cost as botweon the British and Indian Government in respect of the maintenance of Royal Air Force establishment in India has boon undor discussion with tho India Office, some considerable time must still pass before a definite basis of contribution can be arrived at.3. The Cabinet -ill appreciate that in vio-7 of tho present political situation in tho Middle East the prosonco of a strong mobilo Air Forco at points of strategic importance is essential. It is no loss essential that the Royal Air Force should bo in a position&apos; to effect at any moment a rapid concentration for purposes of an aerial offensive/or to despatch roinforeomcnts drawn from all available reserves at the shortest notice to onu or other of tho dlsturbod areas.This can only bo offooted by tho ostablishmont of a wo 11-diofino&apos;.&apos; route with stations at iritorvals whore there aro adequate facil: tivfl for refuelling and for effecting repairs. To this end tho Air Ministry proposo to organiso the Cairo-Basra -Karachi route on tho linos shown  in the ensuing para-graphs of this Memorandum.4. The route, of which a map is attached for reference,will embrace tho following landing grounds, intermediate landing grounds for- refuelling purposes, aha omorfconcy landing grounds:-
5.w 4Main lancVAp1: Ground, Emergency Landing Ground, Intermediate Landing Ground, Emergency .LancUnr*, Grovel. Emorgoncy Landing Ground. &apos;&apos;$tfor$oncy Landing Ground. Emergency Landing Ground. Intermediate landing Ground Emergency; landing Ground, Emergency; Landing Ground. Main, landing Ground,Intermediate,.landing Ground,, To provide the buildings essential tor, the iinau^uratioi of this route an expenditure- of approximately  100,000 trill be necessary* This will be absorbed as follows:-  ...Cairo. \  10,000     ^     &apos;Basra  33,000Karachi .  51,000:   - 4 Interned!ato Stations,   7,000 ( 1,500 a piece)i (Expenditure at Damascus tiot included for reasons in v.:.-; para. 7 below), -.v\ hm^Mi -.      It is. anticipated, that, no expenditure - ill-po required in rospoot of the emergency landing grounds shown above other than a nominal sum to be paid to the local sheikh on condition of hi ft maintaining the ground in order and properly marked.It should not be noted that of the total of  100,000 n less, a euw than. 94,000 is to bo spent on.the o^oction of permanent works at Cairo, Basra and Karachi *  The maintenance of those three stations, in Egypt, Mesopotamia^.,.and India, respectively, and, as a consequence, the provision of-adequate aerodrome accommodation,.is in any case imperative on strategic grounds, and for the normal supply of maohinos to the East, irrespective :of tho needs of a service such as that in -oontomplation between Cairo.and Karachi.;   ., This estimate of  100,000 is. not intondod to represontthe total expenditure which may ultimately he incurred but is to bo rogardod as the minimum which will enable machines to Jbe sent, to India by air.   If it is decided permanently to maintain a larger force of aircraft.at any one of. those three stations than is necessary for maintaining rerjular cowmunioations by air, it is. clear that a further considerable outlay will be involved. Again, incidental expenditure such as may toe incurred for the erection of motoorological and wireless stations is: not covered bv th&apos;s estimate, -. ,.- ^ofti-oThe Air Councilf&amp;. original proposal to the Treasury also contemplated the organisation.of a regular aerial..service for. Cairo to Karachi for the carriage- of urgont -of-fftcixP;, communications, and passon^ers on [official duty.   In, doforonoo A to the objection expressed by the.Treasury they are-prepared to postpone for the prosont tho qaostion; of-tho.organisation of such a service though they would desire to make it clear that the route is one which contains; groat possl-ilities for aviation in its civil and commercial aspects:.  Even, without tho establishment of a regular tervico, thoro would in any. case bo a considoraMo amount of air  traffic ovor tho route in connection with the maintenance of the squadrons in tho Middle and Par East owing to tho necessity of familiarising their porsonnolCairoITamTohOSnasoua2fl?ulfoBaT (Euphrates)RaiHadioh BTpjHdaciSfooikaald (near Kut) Amara &quot; Basra- ,BuaETro     1 Persian ftundarabbas) Gulf.

1*4*        vV 1August 27th, 1910.with climatic ana other conditions of long stance flying, the inception of this route will further make possible a more accurate survey of its interned.late stages, thereby facilitating any subsequent strategic movements of aircraft on a large scale, and in the li^jht of the experience already acquired in Mesopotamia it is clear that it will effectively assist in the maintenance of public order in the Middle East.7. The route as planned provides for the laying out of an aerodrome at Damascus and of an emergency landing ground at Tadmor.    The future status of the territory in vjnlch these places are situated has not yet been decided, but it appears probable that they may be under the mandatory po^er of*prance. It is not anticipated that insuperable difficulties would arise in obtaining the right of passage for British military aircraft through territory under French mandate*    It, however, such should prove to be the case, it will be possible to divert the route to the south and, by using machines of   greater endurance, to avoid passing over French soil;   and it is accordingly not proposed at present to incur any fresh expenditure to Damascus and Tadmor.   (See alternative Routes as shewn on map by dotted lines),8* On the grounds above stated I request that the WarCabinet will authorise the initial expenditure of  100,000 for the works required.9. The Memorandum has been referred to the Foreign Office,and India, who have intimated that they have no objection to its submission to the Cabinet.
****TREASURY CHAMBERS*15th July, 1919*28628 19Sir,I son directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty?s  Treasury to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo (A.17727/S.6) further respecting the Cairo-Karachi Route *My Lords note that the object which the Air Council have in view is primarily strategical, and as stated in Treasury letter of*the 18th ultimo They agree that adequate aerodromes and Depots have to be provided at the various points of the route, in order that the   strategical object may be attained,The question whether it Is also necessary with this object to maintain a regular aerial traffic appears to be much more open to doubt, and My Lords think: that this part of the original proposals may well be deferred until the estimates of cost of a regular service can be examined,,On the other hand They agree that units of the Air Force will have to be maintained at such a strength as will provide for the necessary concentration in case of emergency,  his question forms part of the general question of the strength of the Aftr Force to be maintained, and My Lords think that the decision of the War Cabinet should be obtained on the question of the strength to be maintained in the East, as part of the Defences of Egypt, Palestine and Syria, Mesopotamia and India. Opportunity should be taken at the same time to settle, or at least to raise, the question of the incidence of cost,   My Lords would have thought that the latter question could be determined without any delay, as They cannot think that either the Foreign Office or the India Office could raise objection to the cost of these services being borne by the respective Governments,I am to add that if an aerodrome at Damascus is vital to the success of the scheme, it would appear to be most important to obtain the consent of the mandatory power before embarking upon expenditure at both ends of the route.IS some provisional  agreement can be reached as regards the incidenoe oost of aerodromes Ac. at Basra and in Mesopotamia and at Karachi, My Lords would be prepared to give immediate authority for the wrks at these places to be put in hand forthwith; but They would of course prefer that the Karachi expenditure should be undertaken direct by the Government of India.I am,Si*vYour obedient Servant,(Sd.)   John Bradbury.The Secretary,Air Ministry.
