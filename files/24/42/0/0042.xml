INDUSTRIAL SITUATION AMD MERCHANT SHIPPING OUTPUT -in ReiAdmiralty Memorandum for;the War Cabinet in,Repjv to the Minister of !Sinltioni1^iemorsHlim 8In a Memorandum dated 8th February 1918 Mr Winston Churchill draws the attention of the Cabinet to &quot;certain serious inaccuracies in fact  which he alleges appear in the Admiralty memorandum to the &apos;7ar Cabinet of 5th idem on the Industrial Situation and Merchant Shipping Output.The exciting cause of Mr Churchillls intervention appears to be the view held 3py the Admiralty that aiiong many causes of unrest the 12-;? per c&amp;nt. bonus is conspicuous.Mr Churchill has been advised that the 12h per cent, advance was not an effective factor in the situation in Glasgow in January, and he       seems to make a similar contention wrth regard to Belfastj    At the same time, he quotes two cases which appear to the Admiralty substantially to uphold the Admiralty!s view, one case being in Belfast and the other in Glasgow.In Belfast a strike was occasioned by the attempt to settle what payment to piece workers was a suitable equivalent to the 12i per cent, to time workers.    It is precisely from this secondary effect of the 12j per cent, bonus that the shipbuilding industry suffers, and so far from this case which the Minister quotes being any evidence of inaccuracy on the ^art of the Admiralty, it-ssema to prove the accuracy of their judgment.The second case is still more illuminating evidence of the disturbance of output caused by giving the 12j per cent, bonus to time workers at a crisis when every inducement should be given to piece work and payment by results.Messrs. G.-&amp; Je Weir of Glasgow in a shop where premium bonus had been the rule sustained a loss of-output amounting to 40X by the refusal of the men to continue to work Dremium bonus.    The firm report that work   is now taking twice to three times as longMr Churchill does not apparently.recognise the PJ^inence of this case to a general review of the industrial situation and merchant shipping output^    He states that the introduction of this example is SrtreSSy^lSadiil, as a short output by Messrs  Weir would afford no explanation of the shipbuilding output during January.    The example was not riven as an explanation of the January output but it is unfortunately clear that the effect of this and other sequlae of the 12k% which are not reflected in the January completions, will become apparent in later months.    This fact was impressed upon the Cabinet in the Admiralty Memorandum of the 5th January.
In case sufficient proof has not been supplied in Mr. Churchill&apos;s own Memorandum that he was misinformed in holding the opinion that the 12M was not   an active factor in the Clyde situation in January&quot;, it may be desirable to call the attention of the Cabinet to the fact that of 1I,50CJ men who were on strike, 11 j000 returned to work as soon as the       bonus to piece workers was granted in lieu of the        claimed, only 500 men remained out on protest against the inadequacy of the award to which Mr Churchill refers,    This case is proof positive of the relative importance of the two disturbing factors.In the last half of his Memorandum the Minister gives his opinion and that of his advisers on various matters within the competency of the Admiralty0    Without entering into a detailed discussion on these points on each of which the Minister has clearly been hampered by incomplete or incorrect information, special comment is desirable on the last paragraph of the Minister^ Memorandum0Mr Churchill states that he delivered to the Admiralty during the last five months of 1917 nearly 70,000-tons plates more than he undertook to do.    The only arrangement on this point between the Ministry and the Admiralty is that in accordance with Cabinet order the plate rolling mills should be fed to their utmost capacity? and that shipbuilding should have the call on the platesf subject to an allowance of 73000-tons plates per week&apos;for other uses.    In his reference in the paragraph under consideration to an alleged undertaking to supply a definite amount, the Minister appears to have in mind a statement which he prepared for circulation to the Cabinet in September,    !Phis document was sent to the Admiralty in order to ascertain whether they concurred in its figures0    The Admiralty, however, pointed out that the steel plate productive capacity or the country was much in excess of the figure stated in this Memorandum, and refused to concur in it-y As a result of this discussion, Mr, Churchill withdrew his Memorandum from circulation.While the Admiralty welcome this opportunity of expressing their appreciation of the good work done by the Steel Production Department of the Ministry&quot;, the actual production proves that the advice given by the Admiralty on the productive capacity was in close accord with the facts, and that the estimate which Mr, Churchill asked the Admiralty to accept was very greatly below what might reasonably have been anticipated.(Signed)   A.
