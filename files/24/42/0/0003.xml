Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. BAV/027.Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary.   XXVII. (11th February, 1918.)The recent strikes in Austria have filled the foreground and have thrown somewhat into the shade many extremely important in-ternal developments which is is now necessary to summarise.Count Czernin&apos;s Position.     It is qui$e clear that TJount Czernin is making a desperate bid for the popularity of the working classes in Austria-Hungary, and that he realises that the only hope of internal peace is to press for external peace and to show the utmost zeal for a continuation of the negotiations with Russia.     His policy of being all things to all men is shown bj? the fact that he has a &quot;good press&quot; in all directions, being praised no less by the reactionary adherents of Tisza and Andrassy than by the Socialists of both States of the Monarchy and by the thoroughly honest Radical pacifists of Budapest.     While there are distinct grounds of suspicion in this circumstance (since it obviously suggests that Count Czernin is trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds), it is only fair to point out that his true sympathies almost certainly do not lie with the Magyar aristocrats.     It is to be remembered that his appointment as Minister in Bucarest shortly before the war (as a result of pressure from his friend, the late Archduke Franz Ferdinand) was the occasion of howls of rage from all the Magyar reactionaries v/ho could not forgive him for his intimacy with the anti-Hagyar heir apparent and for what he had written some years before in fs^Cur of the substitution of a centralist constitution, based on racial equality, for the existing Dual System,     On the other
hand it is obvious that Czernin, with his aristocratic traditions, is hardly likely to be very Bolshevist in feeling.     It must therefore have caused a great deal of amusement in sceptical Vienna When the Austrian Minister of the Interior, Count Toggen-burg, on IBth January instituted a comparison between the personalities of C2eamin and Trot ski - arguing that tfust as Trot ski would not hesitate for a moment to end as a cabin boy or a convict for the sake of his opinions, so Czernin, &quot;one of the hardest and most logical natures whom I have ever met&quot;, will not yield one iota of his convictions even if these should make a beggar of him-Czernin at Brest.     from the general tone of the press and from the turn which events art taking inside Austria it is abundantly clear that Count Czernin can hardly risk returning  rom Brest with empty hands.     It is quite openly argued that if he oannot make peace with thia Russian Government the population will be entitled to ask with whom he oould make peace-     If his repeated affirmations of the principle of &quot;Ho annexations&quot; have any meaning whatever, he ought, the plain man argues, to have no diffixwlty in coming to terms with Trot ski, who mor*. than any one else stands for this principle    There is more and more open comment - especially in the Socialist press * upon Germany^ interpretation of &quot;Ho annexations&quot;.     It is realised that the assemblies summoned in Courland and Lithuania by the German authorities are the grossest possible travesties of popular representation, ana that any attempt to build up a policy upon, them is bound to lead to rupture with Russia and therefore to the postponement of peace.    Those, however, in Austria who push this viev/ to its logical conclusion and condemn the   Idea of the Central powers laying hands upon C our land and Lithuctnia find themselves logically driven to recognise that an Austrian solution of the polish question must in its turn prove an indirect obstacle
to peace.     For it is obvious that the Germans can hardly beexpectedr^to-omeent to a renunciation of Courland and Lithuania,while their Austrian ally, whom they have saved  time after timefrom destruction, is allowed to acquire the rioh spoil of Poland.In other words an Austrian Poland means at the least a GermanCourland and Livonia, if not also a German Lithuania.Of course even in militarist circles many people are alive tothese difficulties, and hence a third tendency is gaining ground -and this is widely quoted as the view of Hindenburg and Ludendorffthemselves - that Germany^ true Eastern policy is neither &quot;21 oannexations&quot; nor &quot;Angiiederung&quot; (semi^annexation under some veiledeconomic form), but the acceptance of the principle that permanentpeace between Germany and Russia must always be the main issue, towhich all else must be sacrificed.     On these lines, it may beargued, not only Courland and Lithuania, but also Poland shouldsimply be handed back to the Russians to do what they please with,with the essential proviso that the German military party shouldbe free to draw Germany^ new frontier to the east in accordancewith the strategic and-economic requirements of Germany.    Thecorollary of this, as regards Austria-Hungary, would be that Polandshould not fall under the Habsburg dynasty, but should form awhichnominally independent State/should inevitably be the subservient vassal of Berlin both politically and economically.Count Czernin fs Delegation Speech.     The main lines of his speech are common property, but various Jbiter^eting. details emerge from a study of the verbatim report.     His own press quite naturally treats as the central point of the speech his suggestion that an exchange of ideas between Austria-Hungary and Amerioa might form the starting-point for a general discussion.    He had already led up to this proposal by describing President Wilson^ last speech as &quot;an offer of peace&quot; and by .subscribing to a number-of the latter&apos;s fourteen points - no.-secret diplomacy,, freedom
of the seas, no future economic war, universal disarmament, in-dependent Poland and a league of nations.     Where he remained scrupulously vague was in his references to Italy and the Balkans: he merely reaffirmed his refusal of last December &quot;to make one-sided concessions which would enable either side to continue the war indefinitely without risk.     Where he openly joined issue was, (1) when he insisted upon the defence of all pre-war territory of the Central Allies, and (2) refused all advice regarding the internal government of the Monarchy.     This refusal he justified on the ground that Austria has a tl oroughly democratic Parliament which is alone qualified to decide national questions.      Character-istically enough, however, he omitted to mention that the Hungarian Parliament is the very reverse of democratic, and that the control of the Austrian Parliament upon events is illustrated by the fact that it was not consulted about the war and aot allowed to meet for nearly three years after war had broken out.In dealing v/ith the Russo-German dispute at Brest, Count Caernin definitely aocepted the German view as &quot;justified&quot;, and declared that &quot;all which makes life possible in the occupied provinces is German- owned (deutscher Besitz).     Speaking later on he defended General Hoffmann and minimised the whole incident in a flippant vein.He drew forcible contrast between Petrograd and the Ukraine. Peace with Petrograd would alter nothing for Austria-Hungary, since the troops of Petrograd and Vienna are nowhere in contact, and since Russia can export nothing save revolution and anarchyi    Peace with Petrograd is therefore only desirable because it bringB general peace nearer.     Peace with the Ukraine is an entirely different matter, because the latter has food to export, and because it desires to fix the future economic relations at the peace, not after the peace.     (Here he was careful to add that Austria could do without these imports, and that he was merely
anxious to allay the sufferings of the population.)     The concluding part of his Bpeech was devoted to a very outspoken attack on the strikers and those who urge peace at any price: since it was madness to attack, in the rear a government whose main aim is peace.     He also repudiated with extreme, but certainly asauned, indignation the suggestion that the Government was privy to the strikes, those who said so being either &quot;criminal slan^srers or fools&quot;.A day 3,ater he was in a lighter and wittier mood and took up the comparison instituted betvreen hiaiself end Trotski in a very telling manner.    The difference, he argued, was that both had returned home to submit their action to their respective represent-etive bodies: Trctski had failed and killed the representatives by machine guns.     If he, for his part, failed, he would merely resign, s.nd he left it to his hearers to judge which of the two actions was the more democratic.frhe, Few Hungarian^ .jCr is is.     The workmen^ movement found Hungary in the middle of a fresh polifcioal crisis, which had been ripening for many wseks past.     The Y/ekerle Cabinet, which, it will be remembered, eucceeded the weak Esterh&amp;zy administration last autumn, has like its predecessor never succeeded in securing a Parliamentary majority, and, though the continuance of a govem-ment on this basis is quits definitely contrary to the established principles of the Hungarian constitution, has remained in office by a kind of tacit understanding between the parties.     The Government has from the first proclaimed electoral reform to be the main plank in its programme and indeed its very raison d*etre: but the various party groups on whose support it rested are by no means at one in their interpretation of such a reform, and even if they were, could not carry it through except by one of two methods - either detaching a sufficient number of deputies from the reactionary Tisza party to give them a majority for the Bill or dissolving Parliament and ordering new elections - a very dangerous experiment.
unier present conditions.     Prom this situation there resulted something very like a deadlock.The reform Bill introduced in Parliament just before Christ-mas is the result of a sort of clandestine compromise between the Government and the reactionaries.     It represents a certain pro-grcss as compared with the existing reactionary franchise, since it incr^anes the number of electors from 1,800 to 3,150,000. But the qualifications which it imposes are specially contrived, so ai to ensure &quot;control&quot; over the elections, especially in the non-Magyar districts, to the Magyar landed class and to the local administrative officials, who are in many cases notoriously corrupt For instance the ballot is only to be allowed in sixty-six town constituencies; in the rural districts voting by public declaration is retained,     260,000 women are expected to qualify for the vote, under what the progressive press sarcastically describes as &quot;the lady franchise&quot;.     There has oeen widespread and open satisfaction at the vnfy in which the reform has been manipulated to secure undu*   representation to the Magyars: and even its author Mr. Vazsonyi has been declaring that under the new Redistribution (shortly to be introduced) the non-Magyar races will not be able to get more than a dozen deputies into Parliament.The Army   Dispute.     At Christmas Dr. Y/ekerle found himself in the /vosition of having satisfied-no single group or party in the matter of the franchise, and yet of being irrevocably committed to proceed with the reform - quite apart from the fact that the Crown insisted upon his doing so,     He therefore looked round for seme means of raising enthusiasm and saving himself from an impossible situation.     By raising the vexed question of the In-dependent Hungarian Army, he hoped on the one hand to rouse what is known in Central Europe as a &quot;hurrah-mood&quot;&apos; among his most numerous supporters, the party of Independence, and on the other hand to off^r to the Tisza party enough Jam to cover the franchise
pill in its modified form.    V/ith his Independent friends, led by Count Apponyi, It was all the more necessary to provide some such sop, since he was at the same time   engaged in committing himself to a twenty years economic arrangement with Austria and Germany, such as runs counter to all heir principles.At the turn of the year, then, Dr. Y/ekerle deoided to launch a new party with army reform as the tit-bit in its8programme. According to his scheme the Joint Austro-Hungarian War Office in Vienna was to be abolished, and two entirely distinct armies were to be formed in place of the existing joint army: while the functions hitherto performed by the Joint Y/ar Minister were.to be divided between the Austrian and Hungarian Ministers of National Befence.    iTeedlees to say, in the Hungarian army Magyar .wae to be^ made the sole regimental and aumini atr&amp;tive language, anxi^hua to become a powerful instrument for Magyar! sat ion.    Equipment, armament and training v/ere to remain the same in the two armies, but to be run on entirely distinct lines: and the only direction in which the old unity was to be preserved was to be the General Staff and the Supreme Command.    Dr. Y/ekerle went to Vienna to lay these proposals before the Emperor-King and to secure the latter!s sanction for his change of programme.    But the announcement of the broad lines of the proposed change raised a strom of resentment and disapproval throughout the Austrian press: and it was pointed out that it involved very vital revisions of the joint con-stitution - the Ausgleioh of 1867 - and that this could not be done without the consent of both Parliaments.    This was of course an indirect way of hinting that under no circumstances could-a majority for such a change be obtained in the Austrian Parliament..The opposition to the scheme in Vienna appears to have been quite.overwhelming, and for a fortnight a kind of trial of strength evidently went on behind the scenes - all efforts being doubtless concentrated upon influencing the Crown in one direction or the
other.     On the very eve of the great strike Count Tisaa in a public speech made a desperate effort to back Wefcerle^ military-demands.     He categorically maintained that these demands were not compatible with the existing Ausgleich (thus implying that they could be carried through without the Austrian Parliament): and he actually went so far as to claim knowledge for the fact that the proposals were directly traceable to the initiative of His Majesty.     In his speech he deprecated making this struggle into a conflict between the Crown and the Hungarian nation: but it was obviously a peculiarly perfidious attempt-to plunge the Crown into a no less acute conflict with AuBtria.     At this stage the great strike movement intervened,   and one direct result has been to drive the army question completely into the background, and has enabled Dr. Wekerle to abandon it while saving his face.     He presented his resignation to the Crown and was invited to form a new Cabinet.     In doing so he has retained almost all the former ministers, and has virtually reverted to his original programme. He is, however, confronted with the same Parliamentary deadlock as before, and the political situation in Hungary is only less gloomy and obscure than that of Austria.Hungary and Germany.   On the 18th -January a peace motion of Mr. Hollo (one of Count Karoly^s supporters) gave risetft an important debate in the Hungarian Parliament.     Dr. Vekerle in his reply defended General Hoffmann and emphasised the unassailable strength of Hungary but at the same time reaffirmed the standpoint of &quot;Ho annexations&quot; and international agreement.     Incidentally he argued that to raise the question of Alsace is incompatible with u&apos;3o annexations&quot;.Later in the debate Dr. Wekerle made a very important statement on the subject of the commercial treaties.     Though he kept&apos; assuring th? House that Hungary was defending her own interest very strongly, hie main emphasis was laid on the great importance of
close relations between Hungary and Germany for reasons of world economics.     The two countries, he said, ,lare so bound up with One another in financial and economic matters that two-thirds of our international relations are with GermanyM: and &quot;if Hungary is to share in the great eoonomio traffic from the Horth to the Black Sea we must make our economic arrangements accordingly&quot;.     In short he spoke entirely from the angle of Mittel Kuropa.He made certain definite announcements - (1) that in negotiating with Germany both Austria and Hungary proposed to adopt a prefer-ential attitude: (2) that a joint customs schedule and a  oint tariff were being laid down: (3) that the&quot;commercial treaties in their final form must in any case be ratified by Parliament.    He evaded the point raised by a previous speaker that despite all fair assurances that Parliament would be left to decide, the close inter-connection of all these commercial arrangements with the terms upon which peace would eventually be concluded with Russia might none the less in effect place the country before a fait accompli.    He admitted that the economic questions had. not yet come up for discussion at Brest, but that he and his colleagues and the Austrian Cabinet and the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister had agreed upon the broad lines regarding the economic portion of the peace treaty.     In conclusion he announced that the in-tention was to conclude a &quot;Most Favoured Hation Treaty&quot; for twenty years with Russia, and that both sides reserved the right to enter into closer customs relations with Germany or other States.The Hew Cabinet.     The most telling commentary upon the Premier1s Germanophile attitude is provided by his inclusion in the reconstructed Cabinet of two of the bulwarks of a German-Austro-Kungarian economic entente.     These are Dr. Alexander Popovics, Chairman of the Joint Austro-Hungarian State Bank, who becomes Minister of Finance, and Mr. Szter&amp;iyi, former under-
secretary for Commerce and one of Hungary&apos;e most practical economists, who becomes Linisier of Commerce.     This is a clear sign that the governing class in Hungary is rallying in support of the German allianoe.2.11*IS.
