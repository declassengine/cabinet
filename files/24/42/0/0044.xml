Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information,3SCR3T.FFW/023.WEEKLY   REPORT   01?   FRifiCE*   XEIII.Hill-     I    iin-P.i.1i    in..      &apos;i-   K-iW - iWfcn     I   &quot; **M^-^- - mX   ili^^M^KP-W^^-Pill I(Feb. 15th, 1918)Bolo trial has ended, as was universally expected, in his being found guilty and sentenced to death.    There can be no doubt that he deserves and will receive no.mercy,    What is, however, perhaps more important than his fate is the political effect of the trisl and evidence.     The proof that a creature Of this kind, with ooottndrel written all over him, as one.would gather/from his behaviour, had managed to get into relations with a large number of the leading politicians of France, cannot but add to the distrust of the political world which is so general throughout the countrye     It gives the old world of the Quartier an excuse for once more shrugging its shoulders at the people who govern France and donft know a gentleman from an adventurer:   and it increases the distrust felt by the new world of the v/crking-men to find that a nobody, with millions got from nobody knows where, can make his way into very high political circles.     It is particularly unfortunate that one of the witnesses, a r-eneral, brought out the fact that M. Mandel, 11.Clemenceai^s Chef de Cabinet, was in relations with Bolo and dining with him so lately as last August:   so unpleasant, in fact, that most of the papers friendly to M. Clemenoeau did not report the evidence,   iff. Mandel has published a letter explaining the circumstances in v/hich the dinner took place, to which not Bolo but an official of the Ministry of 7ar invited him:   and adding that what occurred at that dinner and on other occasions gave him the.worst opinion of Bolo which h&quot; frequently expressed.     He has also privately denied to an English acouainton^e that he ever accepted a letter of introduction from Belo to the
General, as asserted by the General.     But the incident leaves an unpleasant impression;   /;.nd a still worse impression is m:;de by the revelation of the very long delays which somehow took Place before the various unfavourable reports on Bolo got through from the Government denartments to the officer conducting the preliminar$enquiry.     One of these, made by a journalist on Bolo&apos;s dealings with the ex-Khedive, was shown by him to a brother journalist who showed it to LI. Humbert, the Senator and proprietor of Le Journal, with the result that after consultations with M. Caillaux and others, it fell into BolcTs own ftand3 months before the magistrate concerned received his cony.&apos;   The delays are explained b?/ tho difficulty of getting  he reports confirmed in America and Switzerland, but they cannot make a favourable impressionM. Caillaux wr.s called and gave his evidence in a quiet and digni-fied manner, very unlike the rhetorical exhibitions in whioh some of the witnesses were allowed to indulge.     He seems however to have fallen into one awkward pit;   for he is reported to have said that his reasop for wanting to see Bolo in May 1916 was to hear his impressions of the prospects in the American Presidential election:   for which, at that time, as is pointed out at New York, neither Kr. Wilson, whom he said he was for, nor Mr. Hughes, whom he was against, had been chosen as candidates.&apos;There can be no doubt that the condemnation of Bolo will have a good effect on the Army, and will confirm the impression already made by everything M. Clemenceau has done that the whole nest of traitors will be ruthlessly cleared out, and politicians and their friends no more spared than soldiers at the front who commit much less serious crimes than wilful treason.   Altogether it seems plain that the spirit of the Army has very much improved in the last months.     This is partly due to the popularity of General Petain whom M. Renaudel, the Socialist leader, described privately the other day as not only the beet but the
1.      s -- 3 -nost popular General Franoe had yet found.     It is also due to the iaany steps taken since last summer to improve the lot of the soldier in many ways, one of them, perhaps the most i^rortant, being that he now gets very frequent leave, every four   months, whereas the best the English private oaii hope for is about once in twelve months. Then again, owing to the fact that the British Army, after the failure of the French offensive last April, undertook to bear, and did bear, the main brunt of last year&apos;s fighting, the French had little to do and were able to do that little with ease and complete success.   And more recently/ our taking over more of the line has relieved the French Government from the un^pular necessity of recalling any of the older men from the land.    All these things have combined to make the Army . much more cheerful, as all evidence, public and private, goes to show, Perhaps the most-conclusive proof if the fact, derived from private but very trustworthy sources, thrt the censors who examine the letters written and received by soldiers n^ find that only 5f: are of a grumbling or discontented sort, a far smaller percentage than was once the case.It is more difficult to gauge the temper of the people than of the Army.   This fact about the letters&apos;written to soldiers is a good sign. On the other hand there is still a good deal of that kind of Pacifism which can only be fairly inscribed by the name the French give it, Defaitisme.   And some -of it is still of s suspicious origin.   There has lately been a nasty agitation of this sort at Lyons, which has ended in the arrest of a gang of thirteen persons, who were engaged in the circulation of leaflets of the &quot;assez de sang&quot;, &quot;war is all the fault of Governments&quot; order, as to which it is significant that the pa^er on which they were published was not French.   Another ugly fact is the recent meeting of the Socialists of the Confederation of the Seine where the Minority, or more Paoifist group, defeated the Majority and
w 4 *&quot;secured 7 delegates for the forthcoming National Socialist Council as against three secured by the Majority, and two by the very extreme or Kienthal section, whose motion was introduced by e woman who made a Bolshevik speech saying she cared nothing for the Society of Nations or for any arrangements made by anybody except the proletariat of t e different countries.     The victorious party in their motion declared against further support of votes of credit for the war, epposed any particioation in the Government, and caller upon the three Socialists who now hold minor and non-political r)osts to resign.     Thtse are all bad signs and are of course emphasized by the anti-Socialist press, whilw the official Socialist organ makes an embarrassed defence, saying that in spite of some * puerile1 talk, the unity of the party is really as great as ever and is secured by the temper of J;*. Clemenceau^ Government, both in home and foreign affairs.     It adds that after all, though all desired peace as soon as possible, no one snoke of a peaceat any price or on the basis of the Status quo.     *nd it reminds itsfreaders that the Socialists of the Seine hafe several times before taken up a line which has hot been followed by thenparty as a whole. To this may be acded, perhaps, that the population of Paris and the suburbs has enormously increased, to over 5,000,000 it is believed, during the war and that the Paris Socialist Federation has drawn in a very large number of members who are not pr^erly speaking Socialists, but rre, for one reason or another, especially Pacifism, anxious to Join in agitations against the Government,     This meeting was therefore less strictly a meeting of the ;party than others.Nevertheless it is difficult not to regard it as *ne more sign of the ultimate carting of the ways between men like IU Albert Thomas cni M, Varenne who really believe in the Union of t-e Nation and the prese-cution of the war till victory is attained, and the Pacifist section who do not honestly believe In either.     There frill probably, as the
mmjiumonite. Points out, be more difficulties than Tr. Henderson seems tore lise, about the Inter-Ulied Socialist Conference which is now inoreparation.     &apos; fter all, the twtr extremes of the Labour-Soeii&amp;istuiirty do not mean the same thing either in Prance or in England.   *7ehave Ve extremists oi the Seine on the one h;.na snainst voting credits;*inri we have I&apos;. Thomas on the other taking oart in a great patrioticmeeting of men of all parties in the presence of 1% &quot;*oincare at theSorbonne,    The meeting, which was addressed by many speakers of variouspolitical views and by E. Leygues on behalf of the P-overnment, wasavowedly one in sumort of 1&apos;Union Sacree, and :\ Thomas laid stressin his speech on th&amp;t union as absolutely necessary.    He has neverfaltered in his attitude towards the war.     If there are people inFrance, as is said, who, supposing that Oermany restored *lsace-Lor-roine would at once ask what thero was to  0 on fighting aoout, he isnot one of them.    He has Aao insisted that the question of &apos;lsace-Lorraine is only a symbol of the spirit of right v ich must nrovern theoeace.     At the same time his practical intelligence shows him thatby professions of faith the war caniot be won, as some of his party think,/as it makes himdoubt the possibility oi controlling Afxicaby a Society of Nations,refuse to commit himself against a commercial boycott of Germany afterthe war till he has seen how Germany behaves, and even regard thequestion of un International Socialist Conference as one not of passionor of pr&apos;noiple but purely 4f expediency.He got into hot water for expressing some of these views while in3ngland;   but he successfully vindicated hie right to express hisopinions.   The wonder to some people is -toy, holding such views, he andthose who think with them not only do not co-operate in the Governmentbut even continue to oppose it and divide against it in the Chamber.Vurenne and he, to name no others, have openly asserted that no dis-agreement with 1&apos;, Clemenceau will prevent them collaborating in the
National defence and Varenne both in public and private declares that nothing will induce him and his friends to bo drr^ged at theheels of the Minority, still legs to have any dealings of any sortk evenwith Bolshevism, which indeed/Le Journal du Peuple denounces.     Therehave been private reports that (Phcraas and his friends would after alljoin Clemenceau.     3ut the best opinion is against their truth.   Inthe fii-st place to do so would break up the Socialist party, whichholds very tenaciously to its discipline and unity, even when as oflate they can only be maintained under colour of phrases that admitof several interpretations.    Then it is said that the personal rela-tions of I!. Clemenceau with M. Thomas and other Socialists are nolonger 30 friendly since he refused them passports to go to Russia.And finally there is the reason If. Thomas has lately given in a publicspeech which is that K. Clemenceau misunderstands and distrusts oopu-lar forces.     This is by no means altogether untrue.   Clemenceau is aLiber.?. 1 of the past generation to whom the Social and economic problemsof to-day are ne*r and distasteful.    He has been called in by theoountry, with whom he is certainly very popular, to get rid of truitorsand finish the war:   and that is the only work whioh interests him,while it is not the only work whioh interests even the most patrioticSocialists.&apos;    Co-operation between them is consequently difficult and1 improbable.     But it might come about if Thomas and his friends ^ere; driven to choose between the Socialist party and the National Cause:a choice which happily has not yet been forced on them.
