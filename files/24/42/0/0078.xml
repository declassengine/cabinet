odonm fees1/DOCUMENTT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAHITIC MAJE^STYlS^qvgl^^^j.)CHS T..678.WAR CABINETWITHDRAWAL 0? BRITISH SI ^13101;6 PROM THE ITALIAN PROHT.Copy of telegram from Signor Orlando to the Italian Ambassador.(Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 347, Minute 3)Your Excellency should acquaint at once the Prime Minister pith the impression of painful surprise felt by His Majesty1s government for the communication received from Sir R. Rodd of the decision taken by the British War Cabinet to withdraw two divisions from our front.    I am not going into the merits of the question viz.(l) where it is more presumable that the next Austro-5;erman offensive is going to take place; (2) where the conditions of the Allied front are more to be dreaded.   Considering only the formal side of the question I come to the conclusion that the decision of the War Cabinet is in contradiction with the recent deliberations arrived to at Versailles.   According to these deliberations the question of the destinations to be given to the Allied divisions on the Italian front was to be intimately con-sected with the constitution of the &quot;masse de manoeuvre&quot; which had to be decided by an Inter-Allied Superior Council following the proposal of the Military Committee.   In execution of the said deliberations the Committee had already put forward some proposals for consultation among the different Chiefs of the Allied General Staffs.   According to such proposals three British and four French divisions actually on our front were to have constituted part of the &quot;masse de manoeuvre&quot; and their destination was to be in a territorial zone next to the Franco-Italian frontier.I also wish to remember that according to the deliberations taken at Versailles the Military Committee had to examine the question whether it was preferable to send to the French front Italian divisions to replace Allied ones.   This for considerations of a moral order.   It seems to me that ail these agreements matured after long discussion and announced in different Parlia-iaents as having been reached in complete concert are virtually annulled by the decision of the British War Cabinet in so far as it exercises attributions which had been definitely entrusted to the Superior Council and it anticipates and therefore prejudges the final decision of the Versailles Committee and of the Superior Council.Your Excellency should also call the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that, from the last news received the con-elusion of peace on the part of Rumania seems to be almost inevitable and that this should let free at least .250 Austrian battalions^to be thrown against our front..0 3a. t&amp;   ;   )
