CIRCULATED TO THE KING AND WAR CABINET.memorandum*Now that peace has been arranged by the Ukraine Rada and that the Bolshevists have publicly announced that they propose to fight no more, it seems desirable to make a brief survey of the Russian position.It must be admitted that the prospect to he sur-veyed is not very agreeable.    Since the collapse of Russia rrade it plain that no effective- military co-op-eration was any lender to be expected fro^ it, we have confined our efforts mainly to the maintenance of our interests in different parts of the country, where they were specially threatened:   the Ukrainej Roumania, the Cossack districts, the Caucasus, and Siberia,    Of Arch^ angel, I say nothing.    The ice-bound condition of the port made action almost impossible.    As for the others s we have done what we could;   hut it must he owned that the results smi not much to boast of.The Allies, under French superintendence, gave maney and advice to the Ukraine, largely for the sake of Roumania.    But the nOn-Bolshevist Ukraine that we as* sisted has made peace with the Central Powers;   and any hope that this peace may prove useless to our enemies,, depends upon the possibility of the Bolshevists upsetting the Rada,We have given every support in our power to Rou-mania;   hut the isolation of that country from her Western Allies, and the abominable manner in which she has been treated by Russia, are inexorably driving theKing
King and his Government towards an arrangement, with Germany and Austria..    Nothing short of some striking event, such as the elimination of Turkey or Austria from, the war, can, so far as -1 am able tb judges save the situation.In the Cossack Country there is sporadic fighting. Some times the Cossacks hold their own.    More often they have to retire before the Bolshevists.    But, taking a wide view of the situation, it must be admitted that the Cossacks show little vigour, that their local or-ganisation is seriously impaired by Bolshevist propa-ganda, and that no very high hopes can be founded upon -their patriotism or &quot;esprit de corps&quot;,There seems more spirit in the various nabionali-ties.that make up the Caucasus, - but we have not yet succeeded in organising anything like a general resist-ance to the Turks, or in allaying-th4 international jealousies which divide the population.In Siberia., which mioht in certain circumstances   &quot; become a great source of food to the. Germans, and where there are, at Vladivostok,: immense stores of munitions supplied by the Allies, local resistance to the forces of disorder has been organised with sdme success, . At the head of this movement N General Semenov,. and, as his success would prevent the Germans from exploiting Eastern Siberia in their own interests, we have done our best to provide him. with arms and money.    But the best we can hope from his movement, however successful&apos;, is the preservation of Eastern Siberia from German ex-ploitation*Prom
From this survey it is evident that our efforts in Russia have amounted to no more than a series of rear-guard actions, which may have delayed the enemy.s ad-Vance, hut have not effectually checked it.    The prob* lero we have nbw to face is whether some more heroic method must be tried, or whether we must&apos;rely entirely Upon the inherent difficulties which a cOuntry like Russia, physically enormous and socially chaotic, will necessarily present to complete German penetration^ 1 assume that we shall not abandon our policy of aiding South-Eastern Russia by the loan of money, and perhaps Of Officers, so long as the people there show the small-est willingness to resist the Turks, or to preserve an independent attitude towards the GermansP    I assume also that the probletn of Archangel will receive careful consideration from the Admiralty and the War Office. Now that ROumania is negotiating for peace, the small Polish Army,: which still maintains itself in Velhynia, cannot, so far as I can see, be used for any important purpose;From all this it follows that, if We are not to sub mit to the almost certain/ if slow, destruction of every organised anti-enemy influence in Russia, some new ef-fort must be made, wholly different in character from anything that has yet been attempted9Nbw the only new thing on a great-scale which is possible, or indeed thinkable, is an incursion by Japan-ese troops,,acting on an Allied mandate, which should penetrate as far as the Ural Mountains, deny the Siber-ian Railway to enemy uses, and open a route by whicheffective
effective assistance might he given to the Caucasus and the Cossacks of the South-East*    This policy has al*-ready been accepted by the British Cabinet and the French Government..    It has been considered, hut not accepted, by the Americans, and the &quot;Italians?    It has not been communicated to the Japanese,    The immediate question of policy is whether we should press President Wilson, against his natural inclination, to give his assent to the scheme *    Without that assent the policy is impracticable^   though unfortunately the converse proposition is by no means certain,I will not recapitulate theaarguments in favour of the plan?    They are all contained in -. telegrams I sent to Paris, Washington and Rome, and in : private supplementary messages which I sent to Colonel House for the information of the President,    I print these in an appendix*    I content myself now with adding some reflections which have occurred to me since the matter was last before the Cabineti-(l)    I feel certain that the President will yield only under the strongest pressure from the Allies, and I feel very reluctant to take any share in exercising this pressure unless we are certain that the Japanese will carry out their, allotted r&amp;le,(2)    We must admit that this is extremely doubts ful.    It is not that the Japanese will be reluctant, in certain circumstances, to lend a force in Eastern Siberia,    On the contrary, there are some signs that they are making a case to justify such action.    In anycase
case it is plain that they  an hardly allow the Germans to control the Eastern Siberian Railway;   and that, with or without an Allied mandate, they would In their own interests take action to prevent such a catastrophe.(3) .   But, though tha Japanese may he ready enough to occupy Eastern Siberia either as mandatories of the 1 Allies or otherwise, I am extremely doubtful whether they would consent either to go a  far as the Ural Mountains, or to be shepherded on their way by repre-sentatives of their four great Allies.    Such a policy would require a large force,, it would compel the di-version to unprofitable work of much Japanese tonnage, it would be expensive, and though it might not involve serious military risk it would bring with it no mili-tary glory.    More important than all it might involve open war with the Bolshevists and might even throw the latter openly into the arms of the Germans.I do not think their risk is negligible.    I am   -impressed by what I understand to be Monsieur Maklofc-Off &apos;s aversion to Japanese Intervention.    This dis-tinguished Russian now titular Ambassador at Paris, is a cadet in politics and belongs to the very class who are suffering most from Bolshevic methods.    Both as a &quot;Bourgeois&quot; or as &quot;Intellectual&quot;, and as a strong pro-ally, he has every inducement to approve Japanese in-tervention.    As a matter of fact he regards it with dismay.    It seems to me a most serious thing to adopt any policy which might revive the moribund patriotism of Russia and, by the very act which gives it new vigour, turn its whole strength against us and our cause *The decision which the Cabinet has to take is plain ly a most difficult one:-^   I must a$d that it&apos;cannot any longer be delayed.(Initialled)    A.J.B,14..2.

fltraplatert to The King and War Cabinet.PRANCE ITALYUNITED STATES OP-AMERICALord &quot;Bertie (Paris)      No;2QO. Cypher telegram to Sir R.ITodd (Rome! No; 184.Mr.Barclay (WashingtonjNo.538.Foreign Office. - January 26th. 1918.. 6..00 pjn,Urgent.   (D).Recent changes in Russian conditions suggest the necessity of a change in Allied policy.a few weeks ago there appeared to be no political or military forces in Russia^ outside the area ruled by the Bolshevistsk which could or would do anything to aid the oauuse for which the Allies&quot; are fighting.   The whole country presented a spectacle of unredeemed chaos.Now, however\ there have apparently sprung up in South and South-East Russia local organisations,, which with encouragement and assistance might do something to prevent Russia from falling immediately and completely under the control of Germany.   Among these, the most 5m-portant are the various Cossack organisations to the north of the Caucasus and the Armenians to the South. The former control the richest grain-growing districts of the country, and almost all the coal and iron.   The latter, now that the Russian Army has ceased to count, will supply the chief bulwark against the Turanian move-ment.The advantage of assisting them is therefore ob-vious. The difficulty is how to do it.   We can reach them effectively neither by the Baltic nor the Black Sea, notthrough.
through Persia and the South.   There is hut one remain- VJ ing line of communication possible: the Siberian rail-way c   Our General Staff are strongly of opinion that this line ought to be used, and that it could be used if the Japanese will, give us their assistance.   At first sight indeed the enormous length of the line to he guarded might seem to prohibit the scheme; but our pro-fessional advisers take a different view - as is fully explained in a separate telegram,&apos;which should reach you shortly.Assuming, for the sake of argument, that this scheme is practical from a military point of view; that the     v Allies are prepared to invite the Japanese as their mandatory to undertake it; and that the Japanese are ready to accept the invitation: it may perhaps be argued that such a scheme, even if successful, would do more ham than good to the Allied cause in Russia,   It involves the temporary control of many thousands of miles of Russian railway by foreigners, and those foreigners drawn from the very nation by whom Russia was defeated within recent memory,   Russian susceptibilities, it might be thought, must be deeply wounded by such a pro-jcct,1 All the information, however, that we have been able to collect appears to indicate that some form of    * foreign intervention in Russian affairs would be welcome to the Russians, and that it would be more welcome in the shape of Japanese, acting as the mandatories of the Al-lies with no thought of annexation or future control, than in the shape of Germans, who would make Russia orderly only by making it German.From
Prom the Allied poSnt of view thro difference is enormous.   While the war continues a Germanized Russia would provide a source of supply which would go far to neutralize the effects of the Allied Blockade.   When the war is over, a Germanized Russia would he a peril to the world.   We think that the scheme outlined above is the only way of averting these consequences and provides the only machinery by which such militant forces as South-East Russia still possesses may be effectually aided in their struggle against German influences on the West and Turkish attacks on the South.   We therefore desire to press its favourable consideration on the Government to which you are accredited. -As events are moving rapidly in Russia decision is urgent.Addressed to Paris No,200, Rome and Washington.
CIRCULATED TO THE KING AND WAR CABINET.Telegram to Sir W* Wiseman,January 30th, 1918*- Please give following message to Oolonel House from Mr. Balfour0A telegram has been sent to Barclay instructing him to urge that Japan should be invited by the Allies to act as their mandatory and occupy the Siberian Railway0Though the scheme undoubtedly presents many serious difficulties the arguments I have set forth in this telegram seem so strong that I hope it will receive very careful consideration^,1 do not propose to repeat these arguments, but there are two points on which I should like to supplement them - one relating to Russia and the other to Japan.It may seem at first sight that this incursion along the Siberian Railway is inconsistent with the rights of the Government now in power at Petrogradc   We have no desire to quarrel with the Bolsheviks; on the contrary so long as they refuse to make a separate peace we look at them with a certain measure of favour. But they have no claim to be the Government of All the Russi&amp;s either de facto cr de Jure.   Especially since the forcible dissolution cf the Constituent Assemblythey
g&amp;hey have no better claim to this position than the autonomous bodies in South Bast Russia which the Siberian scheme is intended to assist: while they are much less likely than these to assist in defending the Roumanian Army, repelling Turkish attacks &quot;on Armenia and refusing supplies to the Germans,So much for the Russian situation.  As regards japan, I need hardly assure you that I quite appreciate the difficulties of the situation.   I am not even very hopeful that the Japanese Government will agree to the proposition if and when made, but ih the present stage of the war I think %k of real importance to do all we can 4 to encourage active Japanese participation.   The effect on the military and ruling caste in Germany may be very great.It may he said that the aggrandizement of Japan, whether territorially (as it might be impossible to get her out of, say, the Maritime Province when once established there) or morally as a consequence of her successful intervention as saviour of the situation, would present a grave danger from the Allied point of view. There is force in this: but on the other side I would suggest that the Japanese occupation of the MaritimeProvinces is a question which must probably be faced in &amp;hy case, as the state of Russia will probably soon render an occupation inevitable.   Japan in such circumstances will doubtless take action on her own Initiative, whatever the wishes of the Allies may be0 As regards the danger of Japanese aggrandisement, the very fact that the Japanese will be forced into theopen
aopen against the Germans, and their respective interests brought into open conflict; should do much to lessen Japanese pressure in other directions.I trust that you will not mind my placing these considerations before you, but the cabinet regard the question as of great military importance.   It Is also, as you will realize3 of immediate urgency.

I in-538&quot;formed IvwJ&amp;x^Jjmcz that the views of the pro-youfessional advisers to His Majestyfs Government with regard to the military aspect of &quot; he question of the occupation of the Trans-Siberian Railway by the Japanese.would be sent to you in a separate telegram.I find however that the recent Information in the possession of the General Staff is too meagre to allow of a detailed scheme being worked out,I therefore suggest that if the three Governments decide to approach the Japanese Government on the subject they -should invite their opinion both as to the feasibility of.-the operation and whether they are pre-pared to undertake it. There can be little doubt that the problem has already been considered by the Japanese General Staff.I am however informed that no organised military opposition is to be expected and that consequently if means of transport are still available when tlie expedition starts, the proposal to occupy the whole of the Trans-Siberian Railway should be within the power of the Japanese army.

The policy therefore advocated in my previous telegram of inviting the Japanese to be the mandatories of the Allies is still worthy of the most careful examination.
