A . . A . (&apos;* ,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.] ^       ^Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1918.SECRET.G.T.-3606. 17THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending the 13th February, 1913.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The situation on the Clyde and the man-power question are discussed.Part II: Pregs Comments.The opinions of the Labour press on man-power and the A.S.E., on war and peace, on the food question, and on conscription of wealth, are summarised.Part III: District Reports.The food question continues to be a prominent subject of commeht, but in certain areas, as, for instance, the northern and north-western districts, the position is less acute. Opposition to the Man-power Bill is still active in the case of the A.S.E., but otherwise the position is improving.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving Stoppage of Work. The week has been singularly free from serious strikes, those at Beardmore&apos;s, Parkhead, and Barr and Stroud&apos;s, Glasgow, and the National Aircraft Factory, at Waddon, having been settled.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work. The disputes among the aircraft workers constitute the most serious disputes of the week.I. General Remarks.Situation on the Clyde.It is satisfactory to be able to report that the general situation on the Clyde has materially improved during the week. The most interesting symptom of this improvement is the dissatisfaction with existing conditions, which was freely expressed at a joint meeting of the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee, Industrial Workers of Great Britain, the West of Scotland Workers&apos; Committee, and representatives of the I.L.P. on Saturday last It will be remembered that a resolution had been passed by the District Committee of the Federated Trades, on the 12th January, to the effect that if the Government did not withdraw the newr man-power proposals before the end of January the delegates would advise their members to &quot; down tools &quot; with effect from the 31st. The District Committee, however, subsequently modified its opinion, and passed an amended resolution attaching a threat to down tools, not to a refusal to withdraw the man-power proposals, but to refusal on the part of the Government to provide facilities for Labour delegates to meet at a peace conference. There has consequently been a distinct struggle during the past fortnight between this Committee and the shop stewards&apos; organisations on the subject of that resolu-tion. The District Committee realises that a call for a general strike on the man-power proposals of the Government would not meet with success.   The Clyde[1100-16] B
Workers&apos; Committee and other shop stewards&apos; organisations doubtless also realise that fact, but being in an irresponsible position, and also avid of any circumstances which are likely to embarrass the Government and the employer class, are using every effort to compel the District Committee to carry out its original resolution. At the joint meeting&apos; of the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee and other organisations on Saturday last, which was presided over by Gallacher, an opinion was expressed that the opportune moment for calling a general strike was slipping past, and that victory for the capitalists is now almost assured. In accordance with a resolution adopted at the meeting, attempts were made by the leaders of the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee to influence the meeting of the District Committee, which was held on the 10th February, to carry out its promise to call the general strike, for which the date originally fixed was 31st January, subsequently postponed to 9th February. That effort has been unsuccessful, and the chances of a general strike in the Clyde area are now remote. The revolutionary element has received a decided check, and the loyal portion of the community have been correspondingly encouraged.These results appear to have been due to three main causes. Of these, probably, the most important is the fact of the national loyalty of the majority of the workers. The second cause was a most efficient campaign in the Scotch press, and the third, exceedingly satisfactory and effective action on the part of the National War Aims Committee. It is worthy of note that in the two most critical instances of apparent disaffection in the past few months, viz., that among the South Wales miners in November last, and on this recent occasion on the Clyde, the efforts of this Committee have proved so immediately effective.There are, however, certain elements of unrest on the Clyde due to perfectly definite causes to which it is desirable that attention should be directed. Of these the first is the trouble due to the 12^ per cent, advance. It is not anticipated that this trouble will attain any very serious proportions. Machinery has been provided by which all claims for the advance can be, and are, expeditiously decided upon clear and recognised principles.The Hope Street Strike and the subsequent closing of the works were serious, but the ultimate enquiry and settlement by the Chief Industrial Commissioner temporarily disposed of this element of danger. Underlying the symptoms which were apparent in the Hope Street matter there is, however, a serious state of feeling between Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s management and the employees of the firm. It would probably be no exaggeration to say that in its relation to its employees the manage-ment is considerably behind the times. As McManus and Gallacher are both of them employed in Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s works, it is clear that any resort to archaic methods on the part of the management in relation to the workers is likely immediately to be resented.The most important latent danger on the Clyde, however, is the question of the riveters&apos; price list. This list has given continual trouble, and has been responsible for frequent and, occasionally, serious strikes. It was considered by the Committee on Production in December last, and several awards were given allowing advances on the price-lists. It appears, however, questionable whether any recognised general price-list is, in fact, in operation, and the Committee&apos;s findings have proved un-acceptable to the riveters. The whole question of the riveting price-list seems to require detailed investigation.These matters are forming the subject of a separate reference to the War Cabinet on the part of the Ministry of Labour.Man-Power Question.Although there is no reason at present to question the conclusions which were advanced in this report last week on the subject of man-power, it is necessary to sound a note of warning on the question of the attitude of the miners to these proposals. There have been several one-day strikes in protest against them, and in Scotland a ballot is being taken on the subject. The question on which the men are asked to vote does not provide a fair presentation of the problem. They are asked to vote, first, as to whether an honourable effort should now be made to open negotia-tions for peace, and, second, to say whether they are prepared to supply 50,000 men from the mines. A reference in this form doubtless indicates the influence of Mr. Robert Smillie. The general assumption that a peace on the basis of no annexations and no idemnities can be had for the asking is not only widespread, but is fostered for their own purposes by many of the pacifist leaders, who must be perfectly well
-aware that it is entirely erroneous. Unquestionably a vote on a reference of the kind indicated is liable to result in a manner apparently favourable to the pacifist policy. Among miners generally, however, the opinion most commonly expressed is to the effect that the principle should be, first, a complete comb-out of all those who have -entered the mines since the war began, and have so obtained protection from enlist-ment, and if this does not provide the requisite quota, recruitment oi regular miners. A ballot is about to be taken in South Wales upon the issue whether the Miners&apos; Federation should accept the Government recruiting scheme or not. It is generally anticipated by the local press that the result will be favourable to the Government.Upon the question of the A.S.E. there is little to report. The Executive has called for a ballot in support of its action in refusing to attend joint conferences, and all indications point to a result successful from their point of view. According to latest information&apos;, the Executive has not yet replied to the invitation of the representatives of other unions to meet them in conference on uie question of man-power. There is thus a maintenance of the status quo. The opposition to the pre-tensions of the engineers has in no wise abated.II. Press Comments.Man-Power and the A.S.E.This question continues in the Labour and Socialist as in the daily press to form a principal topic of discussion.Most notable is an article in the &quot; Clarion &quot; by Alex M. Thompson. He thinks that much of the prevalent pacificism is due to the Governments unfortunate handling of the problem, which has not been marked by that frankness and trust which ought to have formed the basis for their policy. The only alternative to this is a. policy of coercion, which he thinks would be a mistake; that of the Govern-ment has, however, been one of &quot;wobble.&quot; Mr. Thompson then emphasises the importance of the food question, and makes a proposal for a general scheme of distribution through canteens in munition works; this proposal had already been made to the Ministry of Food by the Ministry of Labour.Many papers, which were at first doubtful whether the attitude adopted by the A.S.E. was justifiable, have now come round strongly on to their side. Among these may be mentioned the South Wales &quot;Pioneer,&quot; and the &quot;Cotton Factory Times,&quot; which thinks that &quot;a simple matter&quot; has been &quot;badly bungled,&quot; and regrets that the &quot; tangle &quot; is left &quot; to be smoothed out by the wizardry of Mr. Lloyd George.&quot; The &quot; Leeds Citizen &quot; agrees that &quot; all the engineering unions ought to be on the same basis of agreement,&quot; but argues that the demand made by the A.S.E. &quot; did at least follow precedent and did not for a moment involve any preferential terms in the settlement.&quot; The other papers do not forget the position of the other unions, but are of the opinion that, if men are really urgently needed, it would be pure &quot; pedantry &quot; for Sir Auckland Geddes not to retire from the position he has taken up.The &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; New Witness,&quot; which have been inclined to support the A.S.E. from the beginning, find in the recent developments the vindication of their attitude. The &quot; Herald&quot; asserts that the A.S.E. has gained prestige during the week while Sir Auckland Geddes has lost it. The &quot; New Witness &quot; thinks that, apart from their demand for an immediate armistice, &quot; their attitude is reasonable and logical,&quot; and asserts that the developments which have taken place do not &quot; show any improvement in the methods of the business Government.&quot;War and Peace.The discussion of war aims and peace terms follows on much the usual lines, with the exception of a noteworthy article by the middle page writer in &quot; Forward.&quot; He argues that behind the facade of the Labour party lie &quot; deep divergencies of opinion.&quot; Both sides accept the Labour Party&apos;s declaration of war aims/which is in &quot; substantial agreement &quot; with those of President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George, but the one holds that these aims can be attained by means simply of democratic diplomacy, while the other holds that while negotiation cannot be ruled out, force is the only weapon which the German Government understands. The former party take up much the same attitude, as the Bolsheviks let them look at the proceedings
at Brest-Litovsk and listen to Trotsky&apos;s denunciation of the German object of a &quot;monstrous annexation.&quot; This excellent article might be useful at the present time for propaganda purposes.The &quot; Herald &quot; publishes a frenzied manifesto to the democracies: of all countries to join together and, following the example of their Russian comrades, crush their capitalistic and imperialistic Governments. In a somewhat more moderate article elsewhere, it complains that the decisions of the Paris Conference mark a return to the policy of the &quot;knock-out blow.&quot; Perhaps in concert with the &quot; Herald &quot; the &quot; Call &quot; also prints a call to the &quot; workers of all countries &quot; to unite and follow the example of the Russian workers.The Food Question.This subject receives a very considerable share of attention, compulsory rationing and the consumers&apos; council being dealt with at some length.The rationing scheme is on the whole received with relief, though most of the papers are careful to point out that too much must not be expected, and that even when the scheme has been introduced, the difficult problem of distribution will require careful handling.The Consumers&apos; Council does not meet with very warm support, and its first meeting is hailed by the &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Call &quot; as proving the truth of their early criticism, that unless the Council were given more than purely advisory functions it would prove a failure.Mr. Hyndman, a member of the Council, contributes an interesting letter to &quot;Justice,&quot; in which he complains that it is &quot; already swa,thed up in officialism,&quot; that &apos;: it has no power whatever,&quot; and is &quot; purely advisory and consultative.&quot; He declares that the War Cabinet, not Lord Rhondda, is responsible for the delay in introducing compulsory rationing, protests against the Council having an official as chairman, asserts that the members have not time to waste making themselves conversant with the minutiae of the Food Ministry, and states that &quot; Lord Rhondda himself gave us to understand that the shortage would be very serious indeed  certainly worse than the public as yet has any idea of.&quot;Conscription of Wealth.This subject is attracting less attention; but among other articles which deal with it, there is worthy of note one in the &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; which points out that the Germans made use of the capital levy before the war for the purpose of increasing armaments, and suggests that if the proposal were properly administered, it would not be made &quot; unprofitable for a capitalist to continue his beneficent operations.&apos;&apos;III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.In this district discontent still centres chiefly round the food crisis, which appears to be very grave, and an important demonstration took place on Sunday in Trafalgar Square. Considerable agitation is evident against the present methods of distribution, and this was expressed at a meeting of railway men in a resolution demanding Labour control of food distribution. Again, it is said that in the works of the Integral Propellor Co., Hendon, the workers are in a state of revolt owing to the difficulty of obtaining supplies. On the other hand, at Faversham the workers passed a resolution deprecating any idea of rioting, though demanding immediate action from the Government. At a meeting of the Bermondsey Trades Council on the 5th, one speaker put forward the view that starvation was threatened before the *nd of the year, and therefore urged the workers &quot;to refuse to kill any longer.&quot;Discontent upon the Man-Power Bill is probably to a large extent complicated by the food question, and the view is expressed that only if the Government fail to take full control of foodstuffs is there danger of other unions than the A.S.E. ceasing work.For the most part, as at Woolwich, the demand is now for immediate negotia-tions for peace, but the same direct opposition to the man-power proposals is no longer displayed.
South-Western.The position as regards the Man-Power Bill seems somewhat unsatisfactory in this area. The Bristol Trades Council have.passed the usual resolution as to an armistice and no annexations. At this meeting complaints were made of the tyranny of the Government, and a further resolution passed in support of a strike policy. The situation is peculiarly acute among the aircraft workers, and serious stoppages of work are feared locally.Unrest is reported from Cowes with regard to the 124r per cent, bonus.West Midlands.A slight improvement is apparent in the situation in this area.Though the food question in Coventry is reported to be still acute, it. shews in other parts of the district a decided improvement, and it seems clear that the ration-ing scheme in Birmingham has considerably relieved the situation in that centre.Opposition to the Man-Power Bill is still based upon the question of the dilutees, and it is affirmed that every means will be used to prevent the calling up of other workers before the dilutees have been taken. It is not expected, however, that any definite action will be taken until the result of the postal ballot is made known.Agitation upon the question of the 12^ per cent, bonus seems to be less violent, but the piece-workers are displaying marked hostility towards the 7^ per cent, award.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The position in this district is on the whole satisfactory. Trouble may arise, however, in the Yorkshire district unless it is made clear that the dilutees will be the first taken.The I.L.P. at present are very active in-this area; references were made to &quot;the spread of the peace movement in Austria and Germany&quot; at a meeting in Sheffield on the 5th, and it was urged that the present time was ripe for a social revolution. At Loftus, Mr. Roden Buxton made a somewhat violent attack upon the Government. He stated that &quot; the Government has not done what is necessary to secure peace, and we must force it to enter into immediate negotiations.&quot;In the Midlands the food question is still the principal cause of discontent. Thus at Leicester on the 3rd, and at Nottingham on the 7th, resolutions were passed by the N.U.E. condemning the present situation and threatening drastic action unless an improvement &quot;was effected. A similar resolution was passed by &quot;the Nottingham miners. Again, in the munition shops of the West Riding there is much grumbling at the difficulty of obtaining food for the heavy workers, although it is said that the visit of Sir Arthur Yapp caused considerable improvement at Sheffield, where his hearers were left with the impression that the Government are making earnest endeavours to improve the present situation.North-Western.The situation in this district is at present quiet. In Manchester, on the 2nd, a meeting of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Federation passed a resolution condemning a down-tools policy upon the man-power question, but calling for an international conference &quot;at an opportune moment.&quot; At a similar meeting at Barrow, violent attacks upon the Bill were made. It was described as an attempt to smash trade unionism, and as a method of the capitalist Government for supply-ing cheap labour after the war. The usual resolution as to no annexations and labour representation was, however, passed. Again, the Mersey boilermakers are prepared to stand by the Mersey Federation of Trades in whatever action they may adopt to secure a just peace.The general impression is that, provided the situation is properly handled, the crisis has passed, and the local representative of the Ministry of Munitions thinks that &quot; there will be no generalstoppage of work &quot; in his district.There are indications that the food situation is less acute, but in certain parts, such as Bolton, the beer shortage is causing discontent.[11.00-16] ^ ; C
Northern.Discontent in this area appears to centre almost exclusively around the question of &quot; dilutees first.&quot;Strong disapproval of the action of the A.S.E. is expressed in most quarters, and more particularly by the boilermakers, who demand preferential treatment for other unions if this is given to the A.S.E.At a meeting of the A.S.E. held at Willington Quay on the 5th, distrust was expressed at the Government owing to its failure to keep its pledges, and a hostile resolution was passed. But in other quarters, provided that the dilutees are the first to go, the general feeling is favourable to the Bill, and the necessity of carrying on the war to a satisfactory conclusion appears to be fully realised. In Sunderland it is even said that strong resentment is being shown by- all trades at the threatened strike on the Clyde, and a resolution was passed in one of the shops at the Elswick works declaring that the Clyde resolution was &quot; too extreme,&quot; and pledging its support of the Government provided &quot;dilutees be first withdrawn.&quot;South Wales,There is little to report from this district, and the situation is said on the whole to be quiet.Some unrest has occurred owing to the food question, and the Bwllfa Collieries stopped for one clay for a mass meeting on the subject of distribution. Again, the Tredegar workers on the 3rd adopted a resolution in favour of a general stoppage of all industries in view of the failure of the present methods of distribution.On the question of man-power it is thought that the views of the A.S.E. in this district would be unfavourable to the Governments proposals, and hostility among employers has also been reported.Scotland.The situation in this area is dealt with in Part I.IV. Disputes. (a.) Involving a stoppage of work.The general situation from the point of view of disputes involving strikes is distinctly satisfactory, and indicates a marked improvement in the purely industrial situation.There has been no stoppage of national importance; the position among aircraft workers is somewhat serious, although strikes which were threatened in various quarters have been averted. At the National Aircraft Factory at Waddon, however, some 2,000 hands ceased work on the 7th February over the Yl\ per cent, award. A meeting was held, and it was decided to resume work at once pending negotiations.The Shipyard Labour Department report 18 cases of stoppage, 7 of which have occurred during the week.The total number of men involved in the new cases is only 1,129, and of the whole in fifteen cases work has been resumed, so that the situation may be regarded as fairly satis-factory. The most serious of these stoppages involves some 650 of the riveters recently on strike in the Glasgow area over rates on standard and merchant vessels. The men are in an obstinate frame of mind, but it is hoped that an early resumption of work may be secured.At Birmingham 350 men engaged in the manufacture of steel tubes for boilers have been on strike through dissatisfaction with the 1\ per cent, advance, which is not being very warmly received. The stoppage only lasted two days,, and it has been decided that the men shall receive the 7 &apos; per cent, or the 12J per cent., to whichever they are entitled.The Ministry of Munitions reports that &quot; as regards strikes actually in progress the Ministry has rarely been in a better position than at the close of the week,&quot; though as many as nine stoppages which had arisen out of the 12^ per cent, award have only just been settled.The most important of these involved 1,500 steam-men, and was mentioned in last week&apos;s Report. These men.have formed a new society known as the Steam Hydraulic and Enginemen&apos;s Society, and on the 1st February they intimated to their employers (Messrs. Beardmore at Parkhead) that unless the 12^ per cent, were granted to them on gross earnings they would not work overtime or at week-ends. The firm anticipated their action by locking them out, a procedure which has caused indignation locally.   Ineffectual negotiations took
Tplace, and during the week some 4,500 other workers became involved. Eventually the. conference of employers and trade unionists in the iron and steel trades took the matter up, and made recommendations which would ensure an approach to 12  per cent, on gross earnings. On- the assumption that the terms of settlement would be satisfactory the men decided to resume work on the 11th.The strike at Messrs, Barr and Strouds, Glasgow, referred to in last week&apos;s Eeport, has also been settled. The chief difficulty.in the way of a settlement was the firm&apos;s refusal to meet the works industrial committee, either separately or in conjunction with the recog-nised trade union officials. An agreement has, however, been patched up, and the men resumed work on the &apos;7th February.Three other strikes are mentioned as having been settled, and in three cases the men are still away from work. .The Coal Controller has six cases of stoppage to report, two of which have been settled. Three only of these cases have occurred during the week and altogether fewer than 4,000 men have been involved.The V/ar Office Contracts Department reports that there were only two&apos; out-standing stoppages of work at the end of last week. Neither of these is very serious, though it is reported that food difficulties are leading to absence from work on the part of women workers. This is particularly the case in the Birmingham and Walsall district.(b.) Not involving a stoppage of wozk.The dispute between the Corporation War Wages Committee and the municipal employees at Bradford has not yet been settled.The ballot which was held is not regarded as satisfactory by many of the men, and a mass meeting of the employees has been held, which demanded local arbitration. A notice of the dispute has been sent to the Chief Industrial Commissioner.Disputes among aircraft workers are reported from Hendon, Gloucestershire, Bristol, and Cowes.At Hendon the National Aircraft Committee had decided that all work was to cease on the 9th February. They succeeded in obtaining a settlement, however, at the last moment, so that no stoppage has taken place. The dispute among the aviation joiners at Cowes has also been settled; and the trouble in Gloucestershire, which it was feared locally would lead to a serious strike, has also been reported to be subsiding.The number of controversial cases reported by the Shipyard Labour Department is 191; of these 66 have arisen during the week, and 24 have been settled. The majority of these cases nearly 50 per cent., in fact originate in the Glasgow area.The dispute at Armstrong&apos;s Naval Yard, Newcastle, among drillers over the dilution of the shipwrights&apos; drillers with fitters&apos; drillers still continues. The shipwrights are dissatisfied with a recent award on this point, but have agreed to suspend their notices pending negotia-tion. In the same area there is trouble with the platers&apos; helpers at Messrs. Short&apos;s over a demand for participation in an award by the Committee on Production.The number of cases of dispute reported by the Ministry of Munitions is four-teen all except four of these cases arose out of the 12^ per cent, bonus.At Messrs. William Hunt and Sons, Birmingham, a large number of workers have handed in notices to cease work as a protest against delay in appointing an arbitrator to a dispute. On enquiry it has been found that the delay was due to the failure of the parties to supply exact details in their reference.The Coal Controller reports that three new cases of disputes, not so far involving a stoppage, have occurred; in addition to these there are eleven cases previously reported, none of which has so far been settled.A partial agreement has, however, been obtained in South Yorkshire with the Miners&apos; Association regarding surfaeemen&apos;s wages. A dispute is also in progress owing to- the refusal of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association to accept a national award of the Committee on Production, which was obtained in the first instance owing to the action of the National Coke Workers&apos; Union. This award applies to the wages of cokeoven men, and, to enforce their policy of protest, the Yorkshire Association have handed in cards for all their members at the New Monkton Colliery.    It is hoped that a settlement will be effected.Two new cases of dispute are reported by the War Office Contracts Department.By Messrs. Waring and Gillow, Ltd., two applications for advances to workers have been received: one from the Workers&apos; Union for the 3s. 6d. advance to women, and the 12J Per cent, and 7  per cent, advances to male time and piece workers at the White City Factory; and another from the National Federation of Women Workers for the 3s. M. advance to women in the Oxford Street and Lancaster group of factories. The dispute has been referred for settlement to the Ministry of Labour.
The second dispute has also arisen over a question of wages at the Hope Manufacturing Co., Leeds. The United Garment Workers&apos; Union allege that the firm have ignored the Stoker award of May last and the Committee on Production^ award of the 4th October; the firm, on the contrary, contending that they&apos; db not come within the terms of the Stoker award.   The matter is at present under consideration under the Fair Wages Clause.In addition some unrest is reported in the woollen industry in Yorkshire, owing to&quot; the fear of a reduction of wages consequent upon reduced output. Both the woolcombers at Bradford and the Advisory Committee on Top-making refuse to consider any such reduction, and disclaim all responsibility for the action of the operatives under such circumstances.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports about 190 fresh differences, a large proportion of which are due to discontent with the 12^ per cent, bonus. The largest group falls, as usual, within the engineering, shipbuilding, and metal trades, which account for sixty-seven out of the total.Among cases of importance referred to arbitration is the claim of the mining officials in Scottish shale mines, a claim against the London County Council, and a third by the building trade operatives, with reference in each case to the 12^ per cent.D.
