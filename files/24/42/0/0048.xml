Go T*-3640..-&quot;* WAR     C A B IB g TtPALATINE AMD MESOPOTAMIA.FUTURE MILITARY POLICY. (Copies of telegrams from General Smuts.)Itgeneral Smuts to-Chief ef,the Imperial Generaljtaff. (lo. 2 2. dated 15th February 1918)Secret communication following to HAHEEY for the information of War Committee: -I have discussed with ALEENBY the following plan of operations in PALESTIHE and also MESOPOTAMIA and he is in agreement with -the recommendations set out &quot;below.   I unexpectedly had advantage of meeting at AJ..E2AIQRIA General HOPWOCO), lately Chief of the&quot; &quot;; Staff vita. MAUDE and we discussed the situation in MESOPOTAMIA.   . He also appeared personally to favour following proposals, GIU^yjST will arrive at CAIRO on Feb. 20th, and I am anxious to . be in position on arrival to settle and explain both to A1LEHBY and HOPffOOD policy to bo followed in the future in SYRIA and MESOPOTAMIA.    A. I hopo to loavo EGYPT on Feb.. 21st or 2 nd. on my return journey, it is desirable 7/er Committee should consider my following recommendations as soon as possiblo &amp;nd authorise me to stato definitely to them before leaving Var CommitteeTs policy in respect to these campaigns. Thereafter Chief of tho General Staff could follow up the matter with all formal instructions.As neither force is separately strong en;:ugh to go far enough it is impossible to continue the offensive on both *SYHIAH and MESOPOTAMIA!? fronts.   One force will have to go definitely on the defensivo and to feed the other with reinforcements from surplus to its reasonable requirements for defence   MESOPOTAMIA!! Force is the one which should become purely defensive because of its excessive distance from AliEPPO, the danger of lengthening ; the lines of communication, its excessive requirements in railway construction along both TIGRIS and EUPHRATES and tho danger to its right flank, if it&apos; proceed beyond MOSUL,   At present it has very strong defensive positions both on EUPHRATES and on \. TIGRIS between SAMARA and BAGHDAD as well as to the north on 4TEBEL EilffilM, which positions c*e.n be held with reduced forces. Route from MOSUL to north-west PERSIA should bo closed by small detachments working in conjunction with local force levies now being organised by DUUSTERVILLE.   MARSHALL has 6 infantry     y divisions 3 cavalry brigades-and 14 battalions of 1 of 0 troops. Of those. 2 infantry divisions including 13th. division consisting of British troops together with 1 cavalry brlgad   should be definitely earmarked for A1LEHBY and transferred for PALESTINE front.   In this are also included   t batteries of howitzers from Italian front which ere now in MESOPOTAMIA.Continuation follows later
GENERAL SHUTS TO CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF. (No. X 3, 1st Continuation dated 15.2.18.)ALLENBY then will have 10 infantry divisions 1 Indian cavalry division nor coming from FRANCE and 1 caSalry brigade from MESOPOTAMIA in addition to his present 3 MESOPOTAMIA!&quot; divisions. He will he prepared with those to undertake as vigorous an offensive as mil he permitted hy progress of railway cor/aaunica* tiens and physical conditions.   His plans mil include (A) immediate advance to the JORDAN and thereafter the demolition of the &quot;IEJAZ Railway so as to isolate Turkish MEDINA force and support the ARABS. (B) As soon as weather conditions allow-an advance towards HAIFA and TIBS &quot;HAS line,    (c) Construction of oread gauge railway at as rapid a rate as is possible under the circumstances to HAIFA and thence along the coast to E3SUR or to TYRE and BEIRUT cr further tc most convenient point from &quot;which to turn DAMASCUS position through the mountains.    This may haveto ho through TRIPOLI E.....3 GAP.   His main bo ay will advance withthis railway and to assist his transport situation HAIFA and TYRE BEIRUT and convenient ports will be developed on route. (D) Restoration and repair of Turkish line frcm HAIFA via ELFULE and YAHMUK to HEJAZ&apos; railway in order tc support smaller column which will follow this routo towards DAMASCUS and occupy HAURAN area in conjunction with ARABS and DRUSES.    This second column will move some distance behind main force and avoid counter attacks by enemy in superior force.   Other smaller force will operate through Hi 113 of GALILEE   toward the north of LAKE TIBERIAS.   The advance of the main body along the Coast will facilitate supplies, will be protected cn the right flank by the mountains with friendly population and should render it impossible for enemy to hold cn long in strength to any centre in the interior such as D3RAA or DAMASCUS as its retreat will be endangered thereby.III.GENERAL SMUTS TO CHIEF 0?

Genero-3- SMgts to C . I.G ,S . (Eo0X5 Part 3 dated 15/2/18)If Allenby f;s above strength is ira detained in drafts,he will be more than able to deal with whole of Eurklsh force at present in Palestine and Syria,    19 or 20 &quot;battalions are being formed for him in India &quot;but it is a serious question whether in addition to these, every effort should not be made to keep all his hatt--aliens of white troops intact and as full as possible with drafts from home, Ihope to send later a round estimate of require -ments.       According as this northern advance proceeds and enemy strength increases on Syrian front and weakens on 2 liesopct --amian front, Marshall..could still further reinforce Alienby, and this seems to me the only method of effectually co-ordinating the two campaigns. The reinforcement of Allenby by African troops from East Africa or the Congo(more especiallyfSr use in the tropical Jordan valley) and perhaps also by troops from Salonika, should be borne in mind.The total Turkish forces in all theatres are of course still considerable,but it should be remembered that the single railway line through Asia Minor is the limiting factor to the numbers which the enemy can bring to,and supply on,the Syrian front.The most- serious difficulty confronting Allenby in rapid advanc will be railway construction and transportt    I am sending separate telegrams to rar Office giving details of his require--ments in these respects based on joint adyice of Generals GampbeIl,Macaulay and Stewart. To summarise their recommendations Allenby will want for transport,ten additional auxiliary petrol companies complete with workshops and personnelsConstruction of standard gaw^ge railway at rate of tw&amp; miles per day with double track as far as Haifa and from then onwards single track together with repair of Turkish railway Haifa on to and including Hejaz railway will require two battalions of Canadian Railway Sroops and many thousands of unskilled,,As regards labour, 2 Canadian battalions to &quot;be in time could only come from those already in France and I urge most strongly that this be ordered at once and that if necessary they should be replac- d in France by fresh battalions recruited in Canada, Every effort will he made to utilise Turkish prisoner labour and to reorait additional unskilled labour in Egypt and locally,but the possibility may have to be faced that part at any rate of additional requirements will have to be met from Indiar.    In Mesopotamia all railway construction should be definitely stopped and all available labour skilled and unskilled as well as mat,&quot;-&quot; -sr:,-U should be transferred to this front, As regards additional rally nay material, locomotives and wagons I was assured by Granex. m Romethat provided he is advised in time to make necessary arrangements they could he supplied3

No. X.3. (Part 4), dated February 15th, 1918.

A certain amount of total requirements wired separately can be found in Egypt or has already been indented for by General Macauley. I hope to send another wire about these in a couple of days. The balance will have to be found by Granet. Personally I am in doubt about necessity of doubling standard track as far as Haifa. It must be remembered that in proportion as above mentioned ports can be effectively developed advantage of double track and demand for rolling stock will be reduced. Admiral Jackson is sanguine that both Haifa and Beirut can be developed for a very good rate of traffic. Large demand of coal for military use should as much as possible be met from South Africa via the East Coast.

The War Cabinet must realize that the policy advocated above as compared with purely defensive policy will entail a large initial and probably some permanent increase in tonnage. I am sending fullest possible estimate of main requirements with object of enabling shipping requirements to be estimated.
