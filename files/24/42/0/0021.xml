MINISTRY OF SKIPPING.Priority for shipments of FoodsjaiJX^iriZ^ Bary andMarch,On January 18th the Ministry of Shipping presented to the Cabinet a statement as to prospective shipments of cereals and proposed that(a) Orders should be given to reduce shipments of other articles in N. Atlantic liners to an extent estimated to allow the shipment of 960,000 tons of cereals from the N. Atlantic for all the Allies In February, and(b) instructions should be cabled that priority should be girten both on the railways and in the allocation of shipping to secure the loading of 1,100,000 tons of cereals for all the Allies in the N. Atlantic in marchcThese proposals were approved by the Cabinet and action was taken accordingly.The continuance of bad weather conditions and railway difficulties in Horth America &amp;c, will, however, probably result in the reduction of the cereal shipments in February from 960,000 to some 860,000 besides diminishing other cargo.For March the total tonnage including Allied, which will be available both for cereals In all tonnage and for other articles shipped with the cereals in liners does not appear likely to exceed about 1,200,000 tons,   The Ministry of Food requirements outside coreals amount to 180,000 tons.   It is clear therefore that the shipment of any such quantity as 1,100,000 tons of cereals would mean the exclusion of practically all other cargoes than foodstuffs (Including oil fuel and munitions),   In these circumstances instructions have been cabled to the following effectLiner tonnage United States and Canada with cereal transports expect total about 1,200,000 tons for March sailing.Government
Government decision to load 1,100.000 tons cereals must If possible be carried out but Ministry of Pood require 180,000 tons, Ministry of Munitions ought to have 100,000 tons and Fuel Oil as much as possible up to 100.000 tons, but oil allocation willlnot be definitely settled till next week.   These requirements at present conflict0   You should in first instance arrange load in British Liners the 180,000 tons asked for by Ministry of Food,   As In all probability some of the grain will fail to arrive and ;as further Allied tonnage may materialise you should utilise1&apos; the further tonnage thus available in shipping munitions &amp;cs   All other commodities must wait.   It is truo proclse results this policy cannot be4- MacT:n except after event but need for cereals so vital that this uncertainty must be facede   You should report how this policy squares with necessities youi&apos; traffic though as American Traffic Authorities have had ample warning think policy capable of execution within relatively narrow limits.The cereal position has become worse since the action Indicated in the beginning of this memorandum was approved by the Cabinet(a) because of the short shipments from N. America referred to above, and(b) because It has not been possible to provide tonnage for the 650,000 tons then contemplated for February and March loadingin the Plate (largely through failure of Allied tonnage)t   The Plate strike moreover adds a further element of risk.The consequent food position is of the utmost gravity and general instructions have therefore been cabled throughout the world (outside H. America whicjh is dealt with above) that in liner shipments in the latter part of February and throughout March foodstuffs, (particularly wheat, flour ,and oil seeds)should
should be loaded in all practicable cases in preference to other cargo with the exception of certain key commodities (e.g. nitrates, sandbags, gunnies).This action will probably give an additional shipment of about 100,000 tons of foodstuffs (mainly cereals and oil seeds) at the cost of shutting out an equivalent weight of other articles.The main articles which will thus be excluded from shipment or reduced to very small dimensions for the six weeks or so in question are manganese, ore, hides and sheepskins, tanning materials, cotton and cotton waste, hemp, chrome ore^ rubber, wool, jute, graphite, copper ingots, lead, teak, mahogany and logwood, asphalt with minor, quantities of match splints whale oil        (Australian), cinnamon; loaf oil, gutta percha, wax and candles, esparto, and flax &amp;c.This action which has been taken in view of the extreme urgency and gravity of the situation is now submitted for information and covering approval.14.2.18.
