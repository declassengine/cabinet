(1)20th February, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following report on the work- of the Food Production Department for the week ended 19th February:-The Weather.The weather in most parts of the country last week was good for the time of the year, and satisfactory progress was made in sowing the arable land, as well as in ploughing grassland.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. Derbyshire - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a neglected farm of 100 acres near Derby occupied by the o^ner; 50 acres of the farm are existing arable land.   The Committee propose to let to a reliable tenantiKent -   The arable part of a farm occupied by the owner of an estate at Womenswold was entered upon by the Committee in the summer of 1917 and let. to a tenant of the ovmer. . The owner then resumed SO acres.; of grassland, of which the.:grazing had been let to that tenant,. and let; the grazing to another tenant of his. The Executive Committee, served the latter tenant with an order to plough 72 acres out of tho 80.     The tenant was willing to plour-h this land, but the, owner refused his permission, and the tenant at Christmas, surrendered the 80 acres.   The Executive Committee have now been authorised to;take possession of the 00 acres, and they propose letting it for breaking up, to the fircst mentioned tenant,,. who;is already in occupation of the existing arable.The Committee have also been authorised to take
possession of 88 acres of building land at Hartley which used to good corn land;   they propose to cultivate it themselves. Suffolk; Ea3t*   The Committee report having made special inspecti of eight parks, and.have directed the breaking up of an aggregate 140 acres in six of them.   In tho remaining two no suitable land was found.Yorkshire, North Ridinp.   Arrangements have been made lor the ploughing of portions of Norton Conyens and Baldcrsby Parks ^hieh have been added in recent years.Drainage of Land.   The Cheshire Committees have served notices upon the adjoining occupiers for the cleansing of the Sugar Brook, and the Lancashire Committee have served notices for the cleansing of the Glazebrook and the Filling water.Damage by Game.   Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from Norfolk and from the We3t Riding..Determination of Tenancies.   During the week 6 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of b farming in respect of 469 acres, and 8 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 292 acres.. HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Preservation of Bruit and Vegetables.   121 Demonstrations and lectures on Fruit Preserving have been given during the past fortnight, and the Department has taken part in exhibitions at Plymouth and Bridgvyater.. An excellent cinema film hus been produc by Gaumont Company on methods of food production, Including bottli drying and making bread with potato flour.   Canning demonstrations have been given in Chelmsford and Launceston.Glass Jars for Fruit Preserving.   Arrangements made-with&apos; tho Minis of Munitions, Glass Jar manufacturers and retailers for the early distribution of.largo supplies of glass jars are working saticfactorily.   By 9th February the number of orders received fro
different parts of the country was 1,324* and the total number of jars included in the order is 2,212,544.Agricultural Baskets.    Owing to the fact that the Railway Companies will not accept returned empties 227 truck loads of baskets are out of circulation,   as a consequence the large distributing firms in London are refusing to supply agents in provincial markets, and there is a shortage of produce in the centres supplied by those markets. It appears to be necessary for a representation to bo made to the Railway Executive with the object of bringing pressure td-bear on Railway Companies in order that they may accept returned empties.   The scheme proposed by the Department for training disabled soldiers in basket-making under the Ministry of Pensions has not developed owing to the inability of the Ministry to undertake the necessary financial responsibility, but the London Salesman&apos;s Association has undertaken to finance an Institution at Earith, sear St. Ives in Huntingdonshire,., and the .;ork of basket-making has already begun at that centre.Provision of Land for Allotments.   Reports received from 1,117 districts show that 252,739 applications have been made for plots under the Order, and- 229&quot;,401 plots have been provided,, containing a total area of 16^666 acres.Under Regulation 2L the Board have entered on part of the private croundo of an unoccupied house at Lambeth/ with a view to the land being used as allotments.- The Allotment Inspectors have visited 26 Local Authorities, ,and as&apos; a result of these visits the Authorities are taking steps to acquire an additional 620 acres of land (over and above the area included in the total acreage given in the previous paragraph), which area,will permit of the allocation of 10,000 new allotments.   At Bradford 250 acres - (5,000 allotments) are being provided, Plymouth 34 acres (514 allotments), at Hereford 27 acres (378 allotments), Doncaster&apos;30 acres (415 allotments), Cambridge 35 acres (490 allotments) and lalsall 61 acres (732 allotments).
TECHNICAL DIVISION, Inspection of Land. (1) One of the.Department1s Technical Advisers inspected Sir Vauncey Crewe&apos;s Waralow Estate in North Staffordshire. The estate extends to several thousand acres, s that only a general inspection was possible, but special attenl was given to high-lying parts situated above the 900 feet conto The higher land is rough moor, carrying a heavy stock of grouse The agricultural land is let in holdings, many of which are not than 20 - 30 acres, and all grass of very poor quality, the sol sources of Income being the sale of cows and young stock. The policy of the owner in the past has been to let the farms at vej low rents and to spend very little money on the estate, and thij policy has had an extremely bad effect on the tenants. Beyond bringing moral pressure to bear on the landlord, it is difficult see what general action can be taken by the Executive Cemmittee present. It is suggested that the County Education Committee should arrange trials of various roots and forage crops during 1 coming season, so as to be able to give exact advice next autumr Most of the grassland.is capable of great improvement; much of requires drainage, and until this is done, it would be useless spend money on lime and manures, of which the land is in need.(2) -A neglected farm of 600 acres in Oxfordshire has also bd inspected. The soil is a heavy loam, and of fair depth, but the farm is in a deplorable condition, and the conclusion was reache that it would be useless to urge any radical modification In the present., system of management, as there is no one on the farm nit; the necessary knowledge or energy to carry out the recommendatio for improvement. The sbject of the inspection was to try to induce the. tenant to produce as much food as possible during the coming summer. Therefore a draft letter Is being sent to the tenant confining suggestions to very,simple measures with a view tsecuring as good crops as can be expected this year. The Execut Committee decided to terminate the tenancy and to take possessio: but as the tenant contests the legality of the power exercised uj
the Cultivation of Lands Order, the matter cannot be proceeded with until the case has been heard.Use of Mitre Cake in the manufacture of Superphosphate., A report has been received on the experiments which have been conducted at the Rothamsted Experimental Station and elsewhere during the last twelve months.     This report shows that the replacement of sulphuric acid by nitre cake is perfectly feasible from the chemical standpoint, but attended with difficulties ^hen carried out on a large scale. These difficulties become less as the proportion of replacement diminishes, and 15% is suggested as bein?$ suitable.   Cn the- pre-war basis this would cave 75,000 tons of acid and utilise 150,000 tons of nitre cpke per annum.     Two methods by which the re-placement might be effected are discussed in detail.     Field trials with the various products were made at a number of centres throughout the country.     Owing to the very favourable character of the season for the growth of the selected crops, the trials have not given very definite results, and In any case it would be unsafe to draw far reaching conclusions from one year&apos;s work. In no case however, is there any evidence that the Introduction of nitre cake has proved in any way detrimental.LABOUR DIVISION.   . Soldier Labour.     The War Office have issued a circular letter instructing all Commands that every effort should be made to trace, and obtain the services of, all men placed in any category lower than &quot;A&quot; who can be usefully employed on farm work.     It is   -important that as many as possible of these men should be at work within the next two weeks.   , A certain number of skilled men are immediately available in the Eastern Command., and are. being transferred at once to the Distribution Centres in order to meet the imnediate demands in the counties situated In this Comnand.
During the week an,additional 1,000 men were sent! out on to the land, making a total of 31,141 (23,357 skille and 7,784 unskilled) how out with farmers, out of the 35,19 (24j833 skilled and 10*357 unskilled) attached to depots to In addition to these men 1,273 ploughmen from overseas on th months&apos; agricultural furlough are working with Government ho or oiit with farmers on ploughing work.An additional ten men of the South African forces been placed at the disposal of the Department during the wee and have been sent out to farmers.The total number of soldiers sent out for training as tractor drivers and ploughmen to date is 3,275, an additi 246 having been sent out during the week. Horses.     The number of horses issued to date is 5,507, inclu ing 70 horses sent out jluring the week, ,   A return dated the $1st January shows that&apos; on;that date 2,079 horses were compri in teams out on loan to farmers, the number of such teams bel 908. ,  The number of teams out on garig work was 593, dbmprisi 1..334 horses.     In addition, 663 horses were out on loan to farmers without- ploughmen, and 299 horses were at work in the various ploughing schools.Frisoners of Y.ar. Seven additional prisoner ploughmen camps were opened during the week, bringing the total number of men agricultural camps up to 5,698. ifL^AOri\theXand&apos;&apos;i\jS--^98-^j^d&apos;^tpgethe^ with 1,543 released aliens make a total of 7,^341 prisoners now employed 0Y  ^   CA**In addition, 127 prisoner ploughmen schemes are wit the War Office, and also 16 schemes for the employment of prisoners on ordinary agricultural work.
WOMEN&apos;S BRANCHiThe demand for women labour continues to be greater than the available supply.     There is a decided increase in the number of recruits, nevertheless the urgent demands from farmers cannot be met.     To meet the need for a larger number Of women, arrangements have been made with the Ministry of&apos;Labour to include the Land Army in the general scheme for the recruiting of women for all forms of National Service, and the County Committees have also been authorised to undertake local recruiting.The problem of the supply of food for women land workers is growing still more difficult.    New Training Centres are urgently required,: but unless this food difficulty can be solved it will be impossible to open them.The reports on the &quot;survey&quot; now being made of the probable demand for, and possible supply of local labour in the spring are very varied.     In Cambridge the Group Leader has experienced practically no difficulty in obtaining estimates of the farmers1 probable needs.     In Pembrokeshire, on the other hand, it is reported that no Information can be obtained.     In Cornwall the Group Leaders are being Very well received by the farmers who appear to take a great interest in the scheme and seem anxious to help.     In many places they are quite prepared to employ women labour if it is properly organised.7,079 women are accounted for as members of the Land Army as follows:-In Instruction Centres ......... 239On farm work................... 6,012Employed by the Forage Dept..... 490&quot; &quot; &quot; Timber &quot; ..... 115 Waiting to be placed inTraining Centres........ 18Waiting in Depots............... 59Waiting in their homes.......... 1467,079
Women *s Institutes. An officer of the Ministry of Informatl has been deputed to visit certain of the WomenU Institutes i order to afford informatlen to neutral and allied countries.Last year Llandeffan Women&apos;s Institute rented li ac of land which was planted with potatoes. Fifteen members un ,took the work and also undertook the cultivation of gardens w owners, were unable to give any time to thi3 necessary work, an outcome of this effort a suitable piece of land was offere the Institute for allotments.Nineteen new Institutes have been started during thlast week.MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shows the position as regarthe provision of tractors owned by the Department:-Consigned to County Committees andTractor Schools up to and including12th February............................     2,311Consigning instructions given duringthe week................................        141On offer to counties.................... 20Consigned to Scotland      132&quot; &quot;   Ireland       JH 2162,688The following are some examples of notable results achieved by the Government tractors last week:-In Monmouthshire one team ploughed 15 acres in four on very difficult ground.     In the west Riding of Yorkshire a tractor ploughed 18 acres in 58 hours.     Another in the East Riding accounted for the same acreage in 42 hours on a paraff1 consumption of 63 gallons, i,e. 3^- gallons per acre.     Two Tit in East Suffolk each ploughed 21 acres in 53 hours with a fuel consumption Of 88 gallons of paraffin.
The best result for the week In Shropshire was obtained with a Titan Tractor rhich accounted for 26 acres on a fuel consumption of 3,6 gallons per acre.    The Market Rason half unit in the Lindsey division of Lincoln again did the best work in the county^ having ploughed 97 acres during the week - an average of over 15j acres per tractor.One of the Lancashire tractors ploughed 25^ acres on 3j gallons per acre.      The Leominster unit, consisting of 9 tractors, accomplished the most meritorious performance in Herefordshire.     They had extreme difficulty with heavy clay land, but ploughed the biggest acreage of any unit in the county, i.e. 154 acres or an average of over 17 acres for each of the, 9 tractors. The highest acreage is reported from Hampshire where an Overtime tractor ploughed 49 acres in 60 hours on two years Sanfoine ley ploughed 4i&quot; deep, the average fuel consumption being 2.75 gallons per acre.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Sulphate of Ammonia.   The figures for the first eight months of tho fertiliser season; Juno 1917 to January 1918, show that the total deliveries of sulphate of ammonia have amounted to 156,000 tons,    The quantity sold for delivery in the remaining four months is 56,000 tons, so that the total for the season should amount to about 190,000 tons, which is more than three times pre-war consumption, -Superphosphate.   The production cf superphosphate in the same period is estimated by the Ministry of Munitions at 497,000 tons. It is hoped that during the remainder ofvthe fertiliser season another&apos;200,000 tons will be used making a total of approximately 700,000 tons.     This figure does not differ materially from the quantity available in the previous&apos; season (1916 - 1917).    A substantial proportion of this supply is used in the manufacture of c ompound manures.
At &quot;the present time the stocks, both of-superphosphat and of compound manures, are large, but makers are being urged&apos; every effort to clear their works without delay. Basic Slag,   The total deliveries of Basic Slag during the 8 mo of the present season (June 1917 - January 1918) have amounted 524,000 tons, which is at the rate of 500,000 tons per annum; a compared with a pre-war consumption of about 3OQO00 tons.     The demand for slag is still much in excess cf the supply, though several new grinding 7*ork3 are coming into operations     Stocks in the hands of makers are very small, as, owing to the demand, it has been possible to avoid any accumulation. Labour for Fertiliser and Lime Works.   14 skilled lime burners now in the army have been granted three months leave to, return t their old occupation.The release of men from munition factories i3 likely to do something to relieve the demand for labour, both for lime and fertiliser works, and in a number of cases the super-priorit certificates which have been obtained from the National Service Department have proved to be effective.Sulphate of Copper.   The 0rde.ry,fIxing the price of sulphate of copper has now been issued.     The sales for agricultural use this season have amounted to 5,500 tons, cf which nearly 4,000,-tons, or about one-third of the total estimated requirements for the ye were ordered for January - February delivery.     This is a very satisfactory result of the sliding, scale.Potash.   Experiments have been made at the Potash Production Branch of the Ministry of Munitions at the instance of this Department with a view to ascertaining whether the liquor produced in the Bradford Halifax District as an effluent from wool washing will provide an appreciable source of supply of potassium carbonate.     The. results of.the experiments are entirely favourable.
Negotiations are toeing proceeded with quickly with a view to co-ordinating the whole supply, and it is anticipated that this will be effectedi     Some months will, however,, elapse before the market will benefit. :.,freed Cats (licensing).     The following figures give particulars of ;the number of licences and the quantities of oats exported undwr licence from Scotland:-Class of Oats. Number of Licences. Quarters.Seed 1,645 100,644Killing. 44 2,275These figures relate to the week ending tho 16th February, Seed Oats (Purchases and Sales),     The following figures relate to the purchases and sales of stocks acquired by the DepartmentAmount Bought. Amount Sold;Manx 5,682 quarters. 5,889 quarters.Irish 9,145      &quot; 9,145      &quot;Scottish      4,615-      &quot; 959       nTotals       19,440      &quot; 15,995      &quot;Potatoes. Seed Supply.      The total quantity of seed potatoes orderedforward now amounts to 17,256 tons, and the total quantity delivered,excluding those consignments sent forward for shipment, amounts to2,140 tons.The weather during the past fortnight has been favourable and comparatively few complaints have been received..    There is no doubt, however, that certain of the loaders are sending very large tubers in the case tf varieties --which may be sold &quot;as grorrn&quot; and a circular letter bas been issued to those who have entered into contracts with the Department In Scotland pointing out the necessity of throwing off the coarse and large tubers t    The effect of..this letter has been te cause an improvement in the consignments.Arrangements have been made for shipping up to 2500 tens of seed for the army In France at the&apos; beginning of next week.
Potatoes Wart Disease. Licences are being issued with very little delay considering the number dealt with.   Much unnecessary corres-pondence has been caused by the issue in South Wales of a press notice by the Ministry of Food forbidding the sale of susceptible varieties of potatoes without Scottish or Irish ancestry, and as a result dozens of people have written to ask if this means the prac withdrawal of the Board&apos;s Restricted Districts Order. Potato Spraying, The Chief Constable of Reading has approved of a scheme whereby lectures on spraying should be given to the local constables.   Amongst army camps visited during the last week are those at Wareham, Swanage, Lulworth and Bovingten,   In every case the officer who was interviewed arranged that the spraying should i thoroughly carried out this season.A lecture was given last Thursday evening at Harrods&apos; Stores and was attended by employees of the firm who are cultivati allotments.Linseed for Sowing,, Arrangements have been made to collect and control the distribution of all the available supplies in England&quot;and Wales of linseed suitable for sowing for seeding purposes. Seed Growing. A memorandum is being issued to Agricultural Executi Committees drawing attention to the necessity for encouraging the production of vegetable and root seeds.   Owing to the* increasing difficulties of transport, and the general shortage of seeds available for export from the principal seed growing countries, the foreign supplies required here for sowing this-spring will be seriously curtailed, and, unless steps are taken to make good this deficit by increasing the production of seeds at home, the positio as regards supplies for 1919 and 1920 may be extremely grave. Seed Experts and Military Service^   The War Office has agreed to a two months &quot;agricultural furlough&quot; to 28 out of the 32 seed expert. of low category now serving in this country whose names were recen submitted through this Department.
The Ministry of National Service has agreed to givesympathetic consideration to the exemption of men whose cases are submitted to them by this Department with a certificate that they are indispensable experts employed in the production and preparation of seeds of food plants.   This arrangement is satisfactory so far as it goes, but does not allow protection to men employed in the production, cleaning and distribution of seeds, which is essential if the threatened collapse in the distribution of seeds is to be avoided.     Further representations are being made to the Ministry on this subject.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland F. Prothero, IS.P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
