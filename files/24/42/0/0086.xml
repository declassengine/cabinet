AIR    -RAID     PBECAUTT:ONS,Hemorandura by Lord^Kothcrmore.In view of the fact that enemy air raids on London and other populous districts will probably bo intensified in the coming Spring and Summer, the Air Council thinks it right to put forward the following remarks for the consideration 01 the V/ar Cabinet :--(l)   Enemy air raids have hitherto been attemptedmainly on moonlight nights, but it must not be assumed that they will,  in future,, be .rieccsoar-ily confined to times of moonlight-.     Our own experience goes to show that when pilots have become thoroughly trained and arc familiar with their objectives it is possible to go long dis-tances for bombing on fine nights even when there is little light.(2)    The nature of the risk caused by the dropping ofa large explosive bomb;  and that unused by tho dropping of numerous small incendiary bombs is different and these responsible for taking pro-cautions on the ground must bear in mind the difference.    If* a very large explosive bomb waa dropped so o.s to penetrate a crowded place of entertainment the lose of life may be expected to be very heavy indeed,    Hitherto,, wc have been fortunate as to this,, but it is a mere matter&apos;of chance whether,  if enemy aircraft succeeded in dropping these large bombs upon London in the future, crowded public&quot; entertain-&apos; mcnto will escape   At&apos; the same time there is no doubt whatever that it is more dangerous to be in the afreets than under cover..   As regards incendiary bombs,  especial risk appears to arise from the multiplication of wooden structures such as temporary additions on the tops of public offices.     It is not the function of the Air Council to suggest what steps should be taken to minimise those ricks, but it is for consideration whether the further construction of wooden buildings should not be prohibited and opecial regulations adopted to limit their uac at night or at any rate to occurs that fires started in them could be promptly dealt with.(3)    It is,  as above stated, undoubtedly safer forpeople to take cover in any building rather than stay in the open,  as meet cf the casualties are inflicted by. splinters and the majority of projectiles fall in open places, but all shelters that may be improvised or selected should be small and numerous rather than large and fcw;   so as to avoid heavy casualties involved by a bomb directly hitting a big shelter and aloe to limit chances of panic in crowding into them;(Signed).- BOTHEIMEHE.-Air Ministry...20.&quot;2,18... -.
