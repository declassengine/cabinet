(Feb. 20th, 1918)As the day of the General Election Feb. 24th approaches, the attention of Spain is divided between this and the food question and a third which receives still more public attention, that of the sink-ingto Of Spanish shins by Garm&amp;a^submarinest which have been very fr&amp;* (juent of late and accompanied by circumstances of even unusual ftar-barity.     The outrages have been so flagrant and so insulting to Spanish self-respect that even pro-German papers have insisted oh the necessity of the Government taking action to prevent them.     Several of the pro-Ally organs demanded that relations with Germany should be suspended till receipt of a satisfactory rerly to the inevitable of-ficiai note of protest to Germany:   and it is known that the Prime Minister privately expresses great indignation both at these outrages and at the German attempts to foment disturbances.in Spain.in order to prevent her from trading with the Allies.     But there is reason to believe that in spite of private feelings and public indignation the Note actually despatched to Germany was in no way anmltimatum, and-that it admitted or invited an evrsive reply.     IVhas not efeen ob-tained that..   The Germans are so totally indifferent to Spanish dignity or Spanish indignation that pending the offioial reoly from Berlin their Ambassador has been instructed to inform the Spanish Government that the German Government to Its great regret finds it-self obliged to give orders for the sinking of all Spanish ships trading directly or indirectly with the Allies.&apos;Thus the gauntlet is spanly thrown down.    Will Spain take it up? The answer is almost certainly that she will not.     The present Cabinet is weak and divided, and though it contains at least one -  -
strong pro-Ally member in Senor ftimeno, who as Foreign Minister last spring drafted the strong note to Germany on which Count ?.o*nanones fell, it contains others,notahly Senor Alcald Zamora, the legal ad-viser of the German Embassy, who are strong and active pro-Germans. The latter is naturally very unpooular in the. shipping and commercial world:   but pro-Cermanism has other elements to which it can look for support,     The real political feeling of the officers of the Army is particularly difficult to discover and no doubt it is far from unani-mous:   but there is certainly a sufficiently strong pro-German element; in it to make the Army, which is sedu^usly courted by the Germans and regarded with some jealousy by the pro-Ally politicians, especially those of the extreme Left, aa obstacle in the way of ally strong line being taken against Cerman outrages.     Ever since last June the Army has been a power behind the Throne;   and neither King nbr Ministers seem to dare to offend it.     There have been signs Of greater courage of late, as mentioned in, the last Renort, and the officers1 Committees are reported to be having a good deal of frietion among themselves. But for the present, in view of the fate of the Bato Ministry and the rumours of revolutionary strikes - which however never seem to come to anything - Ministers are; not likely to wish to bre??k with the Army. The attempts made occasionally by the Germans to induce the Army to insist on entering the war or at least mobilising on the German side may however be dismissed as of no importance.     For no onw knows so well as the offioers that the Spanish Army is totally unprovided with the equipment necessary for foreign war end that, if it were, to attempt to nrovide it,, it could only do so by the assistance of the Allies.    The Army, therefore, is well known to be adverse to any departure from neutrality.However, even if this obstacle were removed and if the civil Government fully re-W tablished, as it possibly may after a while,
its control over the Army, there would remain the difficulty thatpartie3all Spanish Governments and all Spanish/- except that of Count Romanones - are at. present weak &quot;because they are divided on the international question^     Even Senor Dato and the Marquis of Lema, friendly as they wefe to us, were hampered in their action by one or two important pro-German supporters, such as Senor Besada,     What will happen after the election, when the present Prime Minister has an-aaunced hi3 intention of retiring, no one can of course tell.   But as to &quot;the international issue it is safe to proohesy that no strong oolicy will be followed unless and^until a homogeneous Cabinet is formed.     This could only be done, on the side of the Allies, by a coalition between Dato and Romahdhos,-whifch some Spaniards suggest-.-/ should be womoted fluiUeiousry by British JnffcuenceV    (hvrthat case Bato would have to leave out his few pro-German friends:   and the two leaders would form a Monarchical pro-Ally Cabinet on a basis of practical reforms such as Dato Is Known to favour and such as would probably be sufficient to secure a good deal of supoort from the much-divided Republicans, especially from the Reformists who remain semi-monarchical in sympathy in spite of their union with the Republicans who follow Senor lerroux.     The Reformist leader., Don Melquiades Alvarez, is even said to be quite willing to lead back his followers to their for-ner qualified allegiance to the Monarchy, if the King would show that Monarchy and Reform were not incompatible and, wwr, would adopt a policy of frankly benevolent neutrality towards the Allies.     The possibility of attaining the goal   of such a definite-ly and unanimously pro-Ally Government in Spain would, of course be facilitated if some sort of assurance could be given to Soain that her interests will not be forgotten at the peace Congress, and still ro^re perhaps if Prance could be persuaded to make the concessions Spain desires and is still trying to negotiate in the matter of Tangier.     It would also be necessary to show that it was not
desired to Obtain the help of Spanish trooos or indeed to bring Snain into the waf, but at most to urge the severance of diplomatic rela-tions with Germany.These, however, are all castles in,the air - or more strictly in the French phrase &quot;chateaux en E3pagne&quot; - until we know the oomo^Si-tion of the new Coirtes.     The one thing universally agreed about them is that no single statesman or party is likely to have a majority. The Prime Ministers paper says that the answer to the question &quot;who will have a majority in the new Parliament?-1 is simply &apos;7The King&quot;. A great responsibility will therefore be upon him and if he has the courage to take and the wisdom to uas it he will have what may perhaps be the opportunity of his life.     He has probably some perfectly genuine sympathies with&quot; the Allies;   no Zing af Spain could fail to feel the indignity of the way Germany treats Spain:   and Alfonso XIII is most likely shrewd enough to see that Spain&apos;s interests, first as a Western Power, second as a latin Power, third as bordering on Prance and Portugal, fourth as nearly surrounded by the sea, fifth as having large commercial and cultural associations with America, are and must always be rather with the ^llies than with Germany.    But he is a King as well as a Spaniard, and after the Austrian Emperor the chief of Catholic Sovereigns:   and both these facts are exploited in his mind by the Germans, who represent themselves as the supporters of order,   Monarchy and religion, while..the conduct of the French not only in their own country but unfortunately in Spain has not always been prudent enough in these respects to avoid giving advantage to th$ Germans and ore-Germans who are so numerous at the Oourt of Madrid.Of course His Majesty&apos;s action will be dependent on the result of the elections, in the sense that though he is likely to have the last word if he known how to take it-r the first word will be with the Cortes and must have its influence on thfc. King.     What sort of Parliament will
it be?    Divided and short-lived, say many or most oeople.   The Carlist leader, Vasquez de ITella, has even refused to stand on this ground.     The old parties are for the moment broken up:   the Conser-vrtives into 3 sections under Dato the late ?rime Minister, Maura the old leader, and La Cierva the present Minister of War;   the Liberals into another three under the present Drime Minister (the Marquis of Alhucemas), Count Romanones, who was Prime Minister a year ago, and Sen$r Alba, who broke with both and formed a small party of his own, whioh he at first tried to guide on a strange combination of advanced Liberalism and pro-Germanism, a Policy whioh he seems now to have abandoned in favour of a pro-Ally Liberalism of the Romanones type. The natural tendency Of the King would be to try and restore two more or leas united parties of the old sort, so&apos; that he would have one to hold office rnd the other to reolaoe it when necessary.   But the divided internationalnsympathies that are found among leading men in both parties seem to render this impossible.     It is more likely therefore that he will have to turn to some kind of national Cabinet, and if he has not the oourage to take a frankly pro-Ally attitude and call In a Sanchez Toca- Dato - Romanones - Alba combination, he will probably have to turn to some kind of national minifctry under the Premiership of the present Minister of I7ar, Senor la Cierva, a man of ability, strong will and oommonsense. said to be personally Anglo-phil both on sentimental and ^olitloal grounds, but likely to lean on the influence of the Army which, for reasons given above, would not encourage a pro-Ally policy.     This is reported to be the present intention of both the King and the present Prime Minister, whfi is supporting Senor la Cierva!s candidates in the whole of South-Eastern Spain.    But these intentions may, of course,- be modified by the result of the Election.Various prophecies continue to be made as to what these will be; One such prophecy Was quoted in the last Reoort.   All agree in dis-
Believing in any &quot;clear sweep&quot; by Republicans, Socialists or Regionalisto, though it is expected that the Republicans will carry Hadrid in spite of a Monarchical &quot;bloc&apos;having been formed to resist them.     All these groups are generally put down as gaining about 90 seats between them:   and of course the 90 Deputies would not be in any sense a party, for these Republicans and Regionalists have not muoh in common either in Home or Foreign politics - except that they do not belong to the old Conservative and Liberal parties and reject the Rotative system.     Senor Dato expels to have lfeo or 130 followers^ but other people including his&apos; late Minister of the Interior, Sencr Sanchez Cuerra   do not expect more than 80*   The flOmanoniots may perhaps number 40 or 50.     Neither Sanchez Cuerra nor other recent proohsts put the followers of the present Prime Min&apos;ster a3 likely to be nearly so numerous as they were estimated to be by the statesman quoted in the 1-st Report.   They do   ot expect his party ;B*even to reach 100.     The Maurists are put at about 20.     The general, but not the universal,opinion is that there will be a not very large pro-Ally majority amo$g the Deputies.     If the official Conservatives amount to 90 and the Romanonists to 45 and the followers of Alba to 20, this Is a solid body of 155 pro-Ally Deputies, assuming that Senoi Alba does not change his tone again:   and there will probably be some 50 or 60 Reformists rnd Republicans who will also be strongly pro-Ally:   so that of the 404 Deputies there would be aver $00 pro-Ally, without counting any of the followers of the Marquis of Alhucemas or&apos; Senor la Cierva, or Senor Cambo, some of whom are almost sure to take the same line.     But by next week we shall have no need to oonsider prophecies., unless indeed there should prove to be any truth behind the rumours of some coup d&apos;etat or revolutionary rising occurring at the last moment to prevent the elections being held.   But there seems
no reason to attach any imoortance to these idle tales and every reason to suppose that the elections will take place on the appointed day.     Let uc hope that the results when they are known will be such as will strengthen and steady Spain internally, and lead to the formation of a united Government which oan defend both her dignity and her.interests with rather more courage than they have been defended of late.
