/ This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)i      KBrigadier General Spiers. C1.G.S.Uclonel2103.Paris11th   February, 1918,Your 51930 of February, 8th.French General Staff inform me that the measures so far taken in regard to the dzech and Polish contingents in Russia are as follows1      The direction of the organization and instruction of the Polish army has been entrusted to General Niessel in whose favour a credit of 10,000,000 roubles has been opened for the purpose.     Latest information stated that a 1st Army Corps of 3 divisions (about 40,000 men) was being formed in the Minsk Mohilev region and that other contingents, strength not specified, were being assembled in Ukraine.     Without doubt these are the forces referred to in your telegram.Niessel, however, had recently wired that these troops were incapable of any considerable movement as they lacked horses for artillery and supply columns.28.     General Berthelot has been entrusted with the affairs of the Czech contingents and ha3 been authorized by the Czech Committee to make such use as he thinks best of these contingents.     The French General Laffont has been appointed to command the Czech army with a French field officer as Chief off the Staff.     Berthelot&apos;s original intention was to   move the Czech Army Corps to the left of the Rumanian Army to relieve part of the 6th Russian Army;   this movement has not so far been carried out, however, owing to the difficulties raised by the Ukraine Government which wished to keep this disciplined force which has not been disorganized by Maximalism in Ukraine.     The French High Command can only leave it to Berthelot to decide how the Czech troops can best be used for the advantage of Roumania and the interests of the Allies in. * the present chaotic conditions in South Russia.Regarding the Poles, the offensive operations in which they are engaged for the benefit of the populations by whom they are supported for the moment deprive them of their liberty of action; besides, their transfer to the right, wing of the Roumanian Army appears difficult to realize, either by rail (in view of the disorganization of the railways)  or by road (in view of distance involved and shortage of horses above mentioned.
