EmaJBQ by the Pood Controller.iD SITUATION IN FRANCS.Recent applications made by the French Government for additional help in tonnage and in food supplies have been based on an allefcsd seriousshortage of food in the provinces which were said to be kept short in order that Paris and the l .?ge industrial towns, where labour discontent was more to be feared, might be kept well supplied.The general impression of British visitors to France appears to be, on the contrary, that not only are there good aupplies of bread but also extraordinarily plentiful supplies of meat, butter and milk.   H.M. Ambassador in Paris, has therefore been asked to telegraph to H.K.&apos;s Consular Officers asking for oach to telegraph his general views as to the situation-in his district and later to forward a detailed report.    An abstract of the replies at present received is attached.   These confirm in all essentials the general Impressions referred to above. i      A certain shortage of bread is spoken of in the districts cf Bordeaux and Havre, and a grave shortage in the Nice district: the latter is very probably dfce to transport difficulties and disorganisation which are referred to in more than one report.   Apart from these, and some shortage of bacon and sugar in the Havre district^, supplies seem to be plentiful, k good supply of meat and of dairy produce is specifically mentioned at Brest, and it Is definitely stated in the reports from Bordeaux and Lyons that the rural population are not short of supplies and have not ouffered at the expense of the towns,A possible explanation of this apparent plenty of meat and dairy produce - no shortage of which is mentioned in&apos; any district - is that grain in the hands of farmers is being fed to stock, and before further help is givon by H.M.Government in tonnage or in the allocation of grain supplies this point should be cleared up,.TCith the exception of reports from Lyons and Nice the following abstracts aro based solely on preliminary telegraphic advices from the 1onsular Officers concerned.    V.rhen the more detailed reports have been received they will, if so desired, be laid before the Cabinet.MINISTRY OF FOOD, 11.2.18RHONDDA
BORDEAUX- : Rural populatior- are, not short of supplies other than flour and oats and these only to a certain extent and not so much as large towns.BREST- &quot;    l-io real shortage in any necessarioc of life.

The   country districts have not suffered at the expense of the large industrial centres, but arc more abundantly supplier.   Generally speaking food is very plentiful in Lyons, certainly far more plentiful than in England.. -There, is much waste and extravagance. MARSEILLESConditions are fairly satisfactory;   in restaurants and hotels there is even a certain wasto of food.uAKTSSThere is no shortage of food.    All the shops seem well stocked and thero are no &quot;queues&quot;   There seems to be no scarcity of bread and at the restaurants there is &quot;pain a discretion&apos;5 NICE.There is now a serious shortage of flour and farinaceous *foods such as macaroni etc.     The organisation for the distribution of bread has been bad and wasteful but is now being really taken in hand.   The nominal allowance is 300 grammes per day ( 4 lb. 10 02. per week) but often less is obtainable.   The quality of the bread is also poor.
