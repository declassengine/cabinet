To receive a report by the Secretary on the Work of the Historical Section.II. To consider the question of an increase of the salary of two members on the Staff of the Military Branch of the Section.III. To consider a proposal that the Military History should be published inParts, the first Part to be issued as early as possible.IV. To consider a suggestion that the Histories should be illustrated, and, ifso, to what extent.V. To consider the question of a separate volume being allocated to the Naval Auxiliary Patrol.VI. To consider a communication from the Admiralty having reference to a request from the French Minister of Marine.I. Statement by the Secretary.Sir Maurice Hankey raised the question of the line of demarcation between the various Histories dealing with the Naval side of the war, and that which is being prepared by Mr. Carless Davis for the Foreign Office.&quot;Sir Julian Corbett said that special attention was being paid to this matter; Mr. Hurd, Mr. Fayle, and Mr. Davis were in constant communication, and appeared to have no difficulty in settling their respective spheres. :Admiral Slade offered to read the Flistories as far as they have gone, to corn-pare them with the Naval History being written by Sir Julian Corbett with a view to ascertaining how the arrangement is working, and to make any suggestions that he may consider necessary.This offer was very gratefully accepted by the Committee.[254] &quot; B
Captain Atkinson stated that he had obtained permission from the War Office to approach officers interned in neutral countries with a view to their furnishing information to fill up gaps in the Military History.On Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s suggestion it was agreed that the report of the Secretary and the proceedings of this meeting of the Committee should be circulated to the War Cabinet.II. Proposal to increase the salaries of Major A. F. Becke and Captain J. J. Bell.All the members of the Committee were in favour of this proposal, and a letter from Mr. Fortescue; strongly supporting it, was laid on the table.Mr. Waterfield, on behalf of the Treasury, stated that on principle they could not agree to an increase on the ground of additional work due to the prolongation of the war.General Maurice pointed out that that was not the ground on which the applica-tion was made. It was the importance of the work that these officers were doing; they were highly efficient, and each was in charge of a Section, with the result that the work was being greatly expedited and promised a speedy return to the Treasury.To an enquiry from the Treasury representative, Sir Julian Corbett mentioned that in the Naval Branch of the Historical Section there had until recently been three men on a similar footing with salaries of 500Z. a year or above, one of whom had now been transferred to other Admiralty work and had not yet been replaced.On the circumstances being explained, Mr. Waterfield said he was ready to agree to the proposal going forward and would recommend it for. favourable consideration.III. Proposal that the Military History should be published in Parts, the first Part to be issued as early as possible.There was a conflict of opinion in regard to this proposal, and after some dis-cussion, in the course of which General Maurice stated that continual requests were being received, especially from head masters of public schools, for an official account of the early operations of the war, Admiral Slade suggested that it might be possible to commence issuing one volume of the Military History as soon as it could be got ready for the Press.Captain Atkinson stated that Mr. Fortescue had drafted one volume, but,that the earlier part required considerable revision.Sir Julian Corbett explained that the text of one volume of the Naval History was also now drafted, and covered the period up to and including the Battle of the /Falklands (8th December, 1914).&apos;      It was agreed that Admiral Slade&apos;s proposal should be recommended to theWar Office, that all matter should be got ready in typescript for submission to the . General Staff for their approval, that a similar proposal should be made to theAdmiralty, and that on the return of the drafts they should be finally passed by theOfficial History of the War Committee.It was decided that there was no necessity to extend this recommendation toMr. Fayle&apos;s History, while Mr. Hurd&apos;s History was not sufficiently advanced.IV. Proposal that the History should be illustrated.This item was placed on the agenda at the instance of Sir Arthur Leetham, who stated that Lord Kitchener had always attached great importance to attractive illustrations, which, in his opinion, would vastly increase the sale.After some discussion it was considered that there would be great difficultv in selecting illustrations if they were extended to portraits of officers, types of ships, &amp;o, and it was eventually agreed that illustrations, as apart from maps and plans! should, for the present, be confined to photographs, authentic sketches and views of. scenes of operations, that would assist the general reader to understand better the descriptions in the letterpress.It was decided, moreover, that the opinions of the publishers should be ascer-tained on the question of illustrations generally.
v. Proposal that a separate volume should be allocated to theNaval Auxiliary Patrol.Sir Julian Corbett explained that he would only be able to deal with the main lines of this subject as it affected the general policy and progress of the war, and would be unable to satisfy the known demand for a detailed and personal account of the work of the Auxiliary Patrol.It was agreed provisionally that a separate volume might become necessary, and that, in order to enable the Committee to come to a decision on the matter, Lieutenant Keble Chatterton should be asked to submit what he has so far written, and furnish a statement as to the plan and scope of the work he proposes to write, and also the nature and amount of material available.VI. Communication from, the Admiralty having reference to arequest from the French Minister of Marine.The request referred te in this item is contained in the following extract from a letter from the French Minister of Marine to the French Naval Attache in London: -&quot; Paris,Slst January, 1918.&quot; I beg you to be so good as to ask the British Admiralty to inform us as to the functions and working of the Historical Section. I should especially like to know in some detail upon what principles and methods it deals with the documents necessary for the study of the present wa,r.&quot;When presenting the letter from which the above extract is taken, the French Naval Attache also asked for the views of the Historical Section as to collaboration with the French Historical Section in Paris.The Secretary was instructed to reply to the Admiralty to the effect that the Naval Branch of the Historical Section would be very glad to- furnish the required information. The Section was also authorised to get into touch with the French Naval Attache.General Maurice said it would be a great advantage also if the Military Branch of the Historical Section could get into touch with the Historical Section of the French General Staff, with a view to collaboration and interchange of information.It was agreed that the necessary action should be taken.With regard to the verbal request of the Naval Attache, Sir Maurice Hankey said that he was strongly in favour of an interchange of information., and believed that, owing to the cordial relations now existing, no difficulties would arise in case of our having to decline information on any specific point. It was decided, however, that no action should be taken until the Committee were fully informed of the views of the Admiralty.
APPENDIX.Memorandum on the Work of the Historical Section of the Committee ofImperial Defence.(Prepared by the Secretary.)At the last meeting of the Official History of the War Committee, held on the 11th July, 1917, it was pointed out that the progress of the Naval History was being hampered by the refusal of the Admiralty to permit the Historical Section to have access to certain indispensable material. This difficulty has now to a great extent been surmounted, and an arrangement has been made with the Admiralty which, it is hoped, will secure that there shall be no undue delay in the production cf the second and subsequent volumes of the History. A memorandum on this question was circulated to the members of the Committee on the 9th August, 1917. It was also stated in this memorandum that a room in the Admiralty building was about to be allocated to the Section. This room has now been obtained, and the progress of work in the scrutinising and examination of registers and papers has thereby been greatly facilitated.The material available for the production of the Naval and Military Histories and the method of dealing with it were fully described in the Appendix to the Eeport of the last meeting, and it is only necessary to state here that the material continues to grow with the prolongation of the war.Naval Branch.Naval History.2. The second volume of the Naval History has now been drafted by Sir Julian Corbett as far as the opening of the combined attack on the Gallipoli &quot;Peninsula  25th April, 1915 with the exception of certain North Sea incidents, the material for which is not yet available. Since, however, the documents dealing with the Dardanelles are believed to be complete, this section of the Naval History can be continued to the end. This, together with the account of other oversea operations, will enable the writing of the History to proceed for several months, but the volume cannot be ready for publication until some time after the necessary Home Waters telegrams have been released.Arrangement of Papers.3. The primary work of the Naval Staff during the past half-year has been to collect and make a preliminary analysis of papers for the purpose of the History. A large number of docketed papers have been examined and summaries written (a.) Foreign Waters. The number of volumes of 1914 papers is likely to be less than was anticipated. Forty-two volumes have now been bound, and thirty-eight are in various stages of completion. A few of these papers deal with events in 1915.(&amp;.) HomeWaters. It has been decided after full consideration that the Grand Fleet and Flotilla telegrams shall be bound together in one continuous series; for the period to the end of 1914 they will probably constitute twenty-four volumes. The method of arranging Home Waters docketed papers has not yet been settled.General.4. In November Mr. 0. T. Tuck, Naval Instructor, R.N., spent a week at Portsmouth taking notes from the records in the office of the Commander-in-Chief, who afforded him every facility. The information he obtained is of great value, and it is intended that the other ports shall be visited in due course. Mr. Tuck is at Devonport at the present moment for the same purpose.5. Mr. M. A. Ainslie, Naval Instructor, R.N., who was lent to the Section from the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, returned there on the 5th November, for duty
in the instruction of naval airmen in navigation, &amp;c. During his period of service with the Section he was always most assiduous in his work.   His place has not yetbeen filled. . . .    .6. Lieutenant E. Keble Chatterton, R.N.V.R., joined the Section m September 1917 for work on the Naval Diary. He had from the beginning of the. war served in the Auxiliary Patrol and, owing to his exceptional experience and to the fact that he is an author on maritime matters by profession, he has also, in addition to the Diary, taken in hand the collection of material and the writing of a record of this most important Service. The number of vessels-armed yachts, trawlers, drifters, and motor craft employed in countering the submarine and mine amounts to between 3,000 and 4,000, while the personnel of R.N.R. and R.N.V.R. officers already exceeds that of the Royal Navy.Having regard to the importance of this Service, which represents a new phase of naval warfare, it is a question for consideration how best to deal with it from an historical point of view, and this subject has therefore been placed on the agenda for discussion.7. Lieutenant J. F. H. Pollen, R.N., has completed the track charts and plans of the action off Heligoland on the 28th August, 1914, and of the Falkland Islands on the 8th December, 1914. The evidence on which these charts and plans are based is of a most contradictory character, but, since he has been able to devote his whole time to the work and to compare very carefully the numerous deck logs, signal logs, engine-room registers, and official reports, as well as to consult officers who actually took part in the actions, the result attained is highly satisfactory, and the controversies that have arisen over the naval actions of previous wars are not likely to recur.Military Branch.Military History,8. Mr. Fortescue has written the narrative of the operations in France and Flanders to the end of April 1915, and he is now engaged on the Second Battle of Ypres, which has proved to be a most difficult and complicated affair, so that his progress has not been so rapid as he anticipated. He has also been able to devote some time to a study of the blue books on the Dardanelles and Mesopotamian campaigns.Preparation of Material.9. Captain Atkinson reports that the activities of the Military Branch have been greatly augmented by the addition to the Staff of the three officers whose appointment received Treasury sanction in March 1917. Owing to this increase he has himself been able to devote a considerable amount of time to the collection of additional evidence on the earlv events of the war from officers who have been....... */taken prisoners and repatriated. The information thus obtained is of real value and interest, and will be available for Mr. Fortescue&apos;s use when he revises his draft, of his account of this period; it also contains much detail of a technical character which will be required for the Staff History. Many of these officers have been most anxious to help, and the special thanks of the Branch are due to Colonel F. H. Neish, Gordon Highlanders; Colonel S. C. F. Jackson, D.S.O., Hampshire Regiment;. Majors E. C. Doughty and A. S. Peebles, D.S.O., both of the Suffolk Regiment. A number of officers now serving at Home have also been approached, and mainly by correspondence have been able to fill up most of the gaps in the story of Mons and Le Cateau, where the Diaries were missing or inadequate. Mention may be made of Major-General Sir F. C. Shaw, K.C.B., Major-General Sir F. B. Maurice, K.C.M.G., C.B., Brigadier-General S. P. Rolt, C.B., Colonel W. D. Bird, C.B., D.S.O., A.D.C., and Colonel H. L. James, C.B., Manchester Regiment, as among those from whom the Branch has received most valuable help. The Branch has.&apos; also to thank Lord Balfour of Burleigh for a most interesting account of the retreat from Mons, which he received from an officer now a prisoner in Germany, and which&apos; he lent to the Branch to copy.The Dardanelles diaries have now been read and precis of them made to the end of September 1915, and those for the remaining months should be finished long before Mr. Fortescue will be ready to make use of them. General Sir Ian Hamilton, G.C.B., D.SO., has kindly placed at Captain Atkinson&apos;s disposal many papers relating to the Dardanelles which are of great value and importance.[254] &apos; c
General.10. The ordinary administrative work of the Branch has increased with the development of the different campaigns. More diaries come in every month, and the amount of correspondence continually increases. Owing1 to the accumulation of material it will be necessary to make a further application for storage room to the Secretary of the Public Record Office, who has always been most helpful in providing accommodation.11. In addition to the Canadian War Records Section there are now installed in London Historical Sections belonging to Australia and New Zealand, and the same arrangements have been made with them as with the Canadians, whereby the original copies of the diaries go to the Dominions, who in return furnish the Branch with complete duplicates.  This arrangement is working satisfactorily.Staff.12. When the Treasury were asked to sanction the appointment of two assist-ants, each at a salary of 300Z. per annum, it was contemplated that the officers appointed to these posts would act as assistants to Captain Atkinson and Major A. H. Thomas, but when the officers in question Major A. F. Becke and Captain J. J. Bell started work it was quickly realised that they were capable of more than merely acting as assistants, and they have in fact been doing the same work as Major Thomas, that is, each is taking a separate Section and working quite independently. They have proved themselves most capable and efficient in every way. Captain Bell is engaged at present in examining and summarising the war diaries of 1916. Major Becke has made a special study of the artillery diaries, and his precis is being used by Mr. Fortescue; he has also been assisting Captain Atkinson in collecting evidence from repatriated officer prisoners cf war, while his skill as a draughtsman has been of great utility in the preparation of sketches and plans. The work of the Military Branch has consequently advanced far more rapidly from the point of view of preparing material for Mr. Fortescue than it would have done had these appointments been filled by officers of less experience.Before the war Major Becke, who has written several books on Military History, was employed by the Military Instruction Delegacy of the University of Oxford as Lecturer in Military Subjects, and his services in this capacity were recognised publicly by the University, which conferred upon him the Degree of Master of Arts honoris causa.Captain Bell, who was a scholar of his college at Oxford, took a good class in the Oxford Honour School of Modern History, and was employed as Lecturer in History in the University of Liverpool, and subsequently in the University of Toronto.It is considered that remuneration at the rate of 300Z. per annum is inadequate for men with the Qualifications and capabilities of these two officers. Captain Atkinson recommends, therefore, that Major Becke and Captain Bell shall be placed on the same footing as Major Thomas, that is, that their salaries should be raised to 5007. per annum.13. Lieutenant C. G. Douie, Dorsetshire Regiment, returned to active service in&apos;&quot; August, 1917. He was of great assistance during his period of dutv with the Branch, and has been replaced by Capt. C. A. L. Brownlow, D.S.O., R.F.A.History of the Effect of Naval Operations on Seaborne Trade.14. Volume I of this History, which is being written by Mr. C. E. Fayle, is finished, subject to a few outstanding queries, and covers the first six months of the war. Volume II, as at present planned, will cover the period to the autumn of 1916, and Volume III will thus begin with the intensification of the submarine attack on the one hand and the creation of the Shipping Controller^ Office on the other. It is hoped that the work will be completed in three volumes.A large amount of material for the second and third volumes has been collected and comprises Admiralty papers, information bearing on shipping and trade collected by the Garton Foundation and a mass of material which Mr. Fayle has got together from various sources.- It is anticipated that the second volume will not take so long to write as the first: partly because the scope of the work has now been more exactly defined and partly because more of the material is available in an accessible and digested lorm.
History of the Merchant Navy in the War.15. This was the last of the Official Histories to be undertaken, and it is interesting. to mention that no history of the kind has been prepared after any previous war. Mr, Archibald Hurd began work in August, and has finished the four preliminary chapters. The section dealing with the auxiliary patrol, which, is being written by Lieut. Chatter ton, is well in hand. The preparation of a complete summary of every notable action between merchant ships and submarines is being made, and attention is being also devoted to fights between armed merchant cruisers in the early part of the war.Mr. Hurd wishes to acknowledge the cordial assistance given him by all the Departments concerned.Line of Demarcation Between Mr. Fayle&apos;s and Mr. Hurd&apos;s Histories.16. To avoid overlapping, Mr. Fayle and Mr. Hurd have come to an agreement as to the scope of their respective Histories, both of which deal either directly or indirectly with the work of the British mercantile marine.17. To put the matter as broadly as possible, Mr. Hurd&apos;s work will embrace the organisation of the marine, its relations with the Admiralty and other Govern-ment Departments, the manner in which these relations have developed during the war and the services which it has rendered. He is concerned with seaborne trade only as one of the services so rendered, and will deal rather with the changes which became necessary in the organisation and control of the mercantile marine to enable it to carry on trade under war conditions, than with the manner in which the volume of trade was affected by the incidents of the war. He will lay special stress on the personal and psychological aspects of the merchant service and will ignore, so far as possible, pure economic factors.18. Mr. Fayle&apos;s subject is the effect of the war at sea on seaborne trade. Direct effects include the capture or sinking of merchant vessels, allied, hostile, or neutral; the suspension or diversion of traffic due to the closing of routes or the presence of enemy vessels off a port, and the corresponding fluctuations of imoorts and exports; the stoppage of enemy trade; rises in insurance rates and freights due to fear of capture, &amp;c. Indirect effects include such matters as shortage of tonnage and congestion of ports, so far as these can be traced to the result of naval operations: reference will also be made to financial and economic causes of disturbance with a view to ascertaining how far the dislocation of trade was due to the effects of hostile attack.19. All operations as such will be fully described by Sir Julian Corbett in his Naval History.Blockade.20. With regard to the blockade of Germany and the restriction of enemy trade, Mr. Carless Davis, C.B.E., of the War Trade Intelligence Department, is preparing an account of the legal aspects of the blockade and the arrangements made with neutral Governments and such bodies as the Netherlands Oversea Trust. Mr. Fayle will confine himself to a general description of the effect upon enemy States, of the successive measures taken to intercept contraband, and the severance of their maritime communications.21. Mr. Davis is being assisted by Mr. R. de B. Layard, C.M.G., who acts as liaison between the Historical Sections of the Committee of Imperial Defence and the War Trade Intelligence Department, by which arrangement the danger of over-lapping is still further safeguarded.Diary of the War.22. The diary of the war consists of a chronological record of events day by day and a monthly summary giving a short account arranged as far as possible chronologically of the naval, military and political (including blockade) events in every theatre and every country. The diary is illustrated by maps.
Military.23. The military section, in charge of Major H. T. Skinner, D.S.O., has been completed to the end of December, 1914. It has also been written up from January to June, 1915, but this part requires some revision.Major Skinner has taken a very great interest in his work. He is being assisted by Major A. R. S. Sale-Hill, who relieved Captain C. C. Langhorne, and by Captain H. FitzM. Stacke, M.C., who has just joined.Naval.24. The naval section has been completed to the end of September, 1914, and the three succeeding months will shortly be finished. The groundwork for the period from January to June, 1915, has also been done. * Lieut. Chatterton is in charge of this section, but since he is also writing an account of the auxiliary patrol service the diary is not so far advanced as it would otherwise have been.Political.25. The political section has been completed to the end of June, 1915, and includes an introduction dealing with events leading up to the war. The diary of this section has been compiled by Captain E. G. F. Abraham, whose work has been characterised by great discernment and penetration. He is much indebted to Mr. Edward Parkes, Assistant Librarian, Foreign Office, for affording him every facility for obtaining the necessary evidence among the Foreign Office papers. Captain Abraham has been recently transferred to the Secretariat of the War Cabinet, and his place has been filled by Lieutenant W. St. J. Pym.E. Y.
