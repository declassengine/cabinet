Animals448 17,145 5,008No vehicjes-only pack transport with divisions; the Greek General Staff having insisted on this, basing themselves on the experiences gained in the wars of 1912-13, and contempating the ultimate resumption of open warfare.
The following units will constitute the Corps troops of each of the three Army Corps, which it is at present proposed to mobilize : A regiment of field artillery of three groups of three batteries of four guns.An artillery park consisting of three artillery ammunition columns and a mobilerepair workshop. A company of sappers and miners. A pontoon company. Two bridging half-sections.A company of telegraphists with lighting section.A searchlight section.An aviation flight (&quot; escadrille &quot;).A sanitary park with prophylactic section.Two automobile sanitary sections.Two administrative convoys (one on wheels, one pack), A section for utilizing local reserves. A court-martial. A band.V. Improvement of Existing Communications in Greece.(A.) Railways.The Hellenique Company is deficient of three things principally, viz. .: (a.) Coal or lignite. (b.) Rolling stock, (e.) A good staff.(a.) Lignite and coal. The output of the Malacassa and Alivieri mines has been increased. (Wages raised, premiums given for extra production, construction of a 60 cm. line between Malacassa and the Athens Larissa main line.)The output of the K.Y.M.I. mine, hitherto reserved for the Allies, has been ceded to Greece up to a yield of 6,0Q0 tons per month.Fjance has given 4,000 tons of coal to be used lor mobilization purposes. (This coal has not yet arrived.)(b.) Rolling stock. The company gave up 120 trucks and 20 engines to the Allied Armies. On the other hand, the British Government has promised to send 10 engines and 300 trucks.   If these should arrive soon the situation would be greatly improved.Considerable difficulty will, however, still remain owing to the fact that there is only a single line between Greece and the Salonika front and that this single line has very steep gradients which necessitate, between Lamia and Larissa, the reduction of trains to 12 trucks per locomotive.The British Government has promised to give to the company five kilometres of normal railway track now at Salonika ready to be taken away, and capable of being employed for sidings at the tops of the gradients.Lastly, the company has made a contract with the Greek Government by which it undertakes to keep the line between Bralo and Ekaterini in repair and to strengthen the bridges and culverts.(c.) Staff. The company has asked for a certain number of stokers and mechanics which are still deficient. The staff generally is still badly trained and often very neglectful.The secondary lines (Thessalian, Peloponnesus and Attica), are of less importance from the military point of view.   They are also suffering from a deficiency of coal.Note. The statement in my despatch No. 1, of 20th January, 1918, to the effect that 6,000 tons coal was required for the movement of one division was due to an error on the part of the French Mission. 6,000 tons is the quantity required to move all 5 remaining divisions and is arrived at as follows : 80 trains of 12 trucks are required per division, 1 engine consumes 15 kilos (Cardiff) per kilometre, i.e., 15 tons for the journey Athens-Salonika and return.  Thus, for the 80 trains, 1,200 tons are wanted.(B.) Roads.The road Larissa-Monastir is being repaired and should be able, by utilizing motor lorries and horse-drawn vehicles, to relieve the railway of some of the traffic..It will aho be desirable to improve the Volo Larissa road in order to lessen the lieavy traffic which will have to be borne by the Thessalian railways.
(C.) Sea routes.In order to deal with the excess traffic (which may become considerable) sea transport will have to be used, and a service created between Piraeus, Volo and Salonika.Especially, a hospital ship is indispensable for evacuating sick and wounded from Salonika to the interior cf Greece. It has been asked for from the Allies by the Greek Government.VI. Supplies for the Army.(1.) The French Armee d&apos;Orient sees to the food supply of the Greek units at the front. It has been agreed that tins shall continue to be the case; but as England has been entrusted with the principal food supply of the Greek Army as a whole, the British Salonika Force will let the French Armee d&apos;Orient have the necessary supplies for the Greek contingent.(2.) The question of supplies for the mobilized units in the interior of the country does not yet arise, since no unit there has yet been mobilized. Such, supplies, according to the agreements made at the inter-allied conferences, will be furnished by America and England.   The negotiations on this subject are not yet completed.YII. Armament. (A.) Rifles.The three divisions of the National Defence Army Corps are armed with the French 1907-15 Lebel rifle.There are sufficient Mannlichers and Mauser rifles in Old Greece to arm the six other divisions.The 1st and Ilnd Army Corps will be armed with the Mannlicher, and the Vth Army Corps, in Epirus, with the Mauser.France is supplying, in addition, for the divisions of the 1st, Ilnd and Vth Army Corps, 40 Lebel rifles, 1907-15 or 1886 pattern, for each company of infantry, which are required for certain squads of specialists, light machine gunners, grenadiers, &amp;c.(B.) Light Machine Guns and Rifles for Rifle Grenades. The French Army is supplying to each of the Greek divisions mobilized : 8 portable machine guns per company. 16 rifles for V.B. rifle grenades.(C.) Machine Guns.Greece possesses Schwartzlose machine guns, which have been given to two divisions (1st and 13th), and Maxim machine guns, which have been issued to the 9th Division of the Vth Army Corps in Epirus.The other divisions are or will be supplied with French Saint-Etienne machine guns, 1907 pattern, except the 2nd Division, which will receive Colt machine guns.The scale approved is 8 machine guns per battalion, or 72 per division. There are in Greece 165 Schwartzlose, 159 Colt and 62 Maxim machine guns. Greece will receive from France 450 Saint-Etienne machine guns.(D.) Carbines and Pistols.There are in Greece 15,000 Mannlicher carbines, some Mausers and 11,000 Gras. These arms have been or will be distributed to the different divisions.In addition, France will furnish a certain number of 1892 pattern &quot; mousquetons &quot; to make up deficiencies.Greece has only very few revolvers, about 7,000 in all. France will furnish 18,000 automatic pistols, with the corresponding ammunition.(E.) Guns.(1.) Field guns. Each Greek army corps will have a regiment of three groups of three batceries of Schneider-Canet field guns. This equipment is entirely supplied by Greece, which possesses 159 sets.
(2.) Heavy guns. Greece has none. The following are to be supplied : (a.) Nine batteries (36 guns) of 120 long, from the French Armee d&apos;Orient.(6.) Nine batteries of 6-inch howitzers furnished by England. These will consist of 36 howitzers, with 4 spare. So far only one battery, for instructional purposes, has been furnished by England. These pieces will no doubt have mechanical traction, but the question of supplying the traction is not yet settled.(3.) Mountain guns. There exist in Greece 81 Schneider-Danglis 75-mm. mountain guns.   Four divisions have been supplied with this equipment.The other divisions which are to be mobilized will receive 65-mm. equipment from Franbe.   Twenty batteries have been promised, of which only one has arrived as yet.(4.) Trench artillery. Greece has none. France is to furnish a six-gun battery of 58-mm. No. 2 for each mobilized division. This equipment has not yet arrived. One of the ships carrying it.(&quot; Marc Freyssinet&quot;) has been sunk.(F.) Ammunition.(1.) Infantry ammunition. Greece has a considerable stock of Mannlicher and Mauser cartridges, amounting to about 100 millions, and the local industry could turn out 60,000 per day with materials supplied by France.2. Artillery ammunition. What is required over and above that already available in Greece for Schneider-Danglis Mountain and Schneider-Canet Field Artillery is furnished by France.   (Daily allowance and reserve supply).France further furnishes hand grenades and rifle grenades (V.B.) as well as the ammunition for 65-mm. mountain, 58-mm. trench No. 2, and 120-mm. long (heavy) guns.; The question of the supply of ammunition for the 6-inch howitzer furnished by England has not yet been settled. The allowance proposed is 21 rounds per gun daily during the five winter months and 5 rounds per gun daily during the rest of the year.VIII. Clothing and Necessaeies.Existing stocks in Greece suffice for equipping several divisions. Tjit- articles now being manufactured will enable the rest of the army to be fitted ou ;or materials obtained from abroad.Generally speaking, the materials are supplied by England and America (khaki cloth, buttons, thread, canvas, &amp;c).England further supplies blankets, tents and metal cooking utensils.Canvass clothing;, shoes, trench helmets, underclothing and leather for belts, &amp;c, are sum lied by France.All this material is still undelivered. The negotiations with America are not even finished.(Sd.)   W. E. FAIBHOLME,Brig adier-General, Military Attache.
