i,, ... 12 2Colonel Jour? (This Dn-trment is the Property ofis Britannic a/faje:;ty?s Covernment.)Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.B. 11.special immmmuonTHE   PEOPLES OP THE   BALTIC   PROVINCES AMD   LITHUANIA.(with map).Estonia (Estland), Livonia (Livland) and courland constitutevtogether the so-called Baltic Provinces.     The Governmente of Kovna, Vitebsk, Vilna, Grodna, Minsk and Mohilev roughly correspond to what was known between 1569 and 1772 as Lithuania. The Baltic Provinces are the land of the Bets and the Letts, whilst historic Lithuania is that of the Lithuanians and the White Russians.     But kstland, Lettland, ethnic Lithuania and White Russia are to be found on nationality maps alone; they do not coincide with any historic or administrative divisions.    Their national character is determined by the language of the vast peaaant masses, whilst the political boundaries have been drawn by the races to which these peasant nations had been subject, the Poles, the Germans and the Great Russians.     The big landed estates in the Baltic Provinces remain to the present day in the hands of the Germans, those throughout historic Lithuania mainly in the hands of the Poles.     In the Baltic Provinces the Germans and the Jews form considerable minorities in the towns; in historio Lithuania the Jews form the larger part of the town population. The Poles form considerable settlements in the Lithuanian towns, and also enclaves in the rural districts of the Governments of Vilna and Grodna.     The Great Russians are scattered throughout the Baltic Provinces and Lithuania.
1. ThejLsts.The lust3 inhabit the vhole of Estonia and the northern part of Livonia, roughly as far south as a line drawn west and south-east from the town of Walk.     The town of Harva in the Government of Petrograd is also predominantly Est and has recently been allowed by Russia to join the autonomous State of Estonia.The Bets speak a Finnish language and are Lutherans.In 18$7 the population of Estonia was 413,000 of which 366,000 were Ests and only 16,000 Germans.    The same census put the population of Livonia at 1,299,000,&apos; the number of Ests among them at 519,000.    There were moreover 64,000 Ests in the Govern-ment of Petrograd and 25,000 in the Government of Pskov.     Their total number in Russia was given as 994,000.    This figure would have probably to be increased by about 16 per cent to bring it up to date (the birthrate among the Este is low and the deathrate comparatively high).2 and 3.    The Letts and Lithuanians.In the 12th century Lithuanian tribes inhabited the Baltic shore from about the mouth of the River Salis to the Lower Vistula and its hinterland for about 200 miles inland.     They all spoke dialects of one common language which, though not Slav, approaches nearest to the Slav linguistic group.    The most westerly Lithuan-ian tribes, the original Prussians, are now almost completely extinct - just a few hundred of them are left in East Prussia. Differences in historic development have divided the surviving Lithuanians into two separate nationalities speaking slightly different languages, the Letts, who since the 13th century have remained under the dominion of the northern branch of the Teutonic Knightly Order (Kreuzritter). and the Lithuanians, whose upper classes became Polonised in the 15th and 16th centuries and who thereupon came under Polish dominion.
2. The Letts.

The Letts inhabit the four southern districts of Livonia (Riga, Wolmar, Wenden and Walk), the whole of Courland and the three north-western districts of the Government of Viteb?k, usually described as Lattgalia (Dvinek?, Ryeshitsa and Lyut?in).

The Letts in Courland are Lutherans, in Lattgalia predominantly Roman Catholics, some also Greek Orthodox.

The census of 1897 put the total number of Letts in Russia at 1,436,000. Of these 511,000 inhabited Livonia, 524,000 Courland and about 260,000 Lattgalia.

In recent Lettish publications the following figures are given for the territories inhabited by them, the population being calculated for 1912: but it must be remarked that of Livonia only the predominantly Lettish part is taken into consideration:-

Germans 113,000 3.7

Others 160,000 6.2

2,605,000

The total number of Letts in "Lettland" (i.e. Courland, S. Livonia and Lattgalia) is thus estimated at 1,974,000; the total for the whole of Russia is given by the same sources as 2,300,000.



           
The figure -given for Ccurlan^L-s^aaB^xeliaole.     It aarks an increase of about 20 per cent on that of 1897.    The number of Lette in Livcnia in 1912 claimed in the Lett statistioa exceeds by about 50 per cent that admitted by the Russian census of 1897, and for Lattgalia it is double that of 1897.    As in Courland the Letts are indisputably the dominant race, both sides seem to have kept approximately to the truth.     In the oase of Livonia where the question lies between the Ests and the Letts, we may assume that the unusually rapid increase of the Lett population marks an over-statement on their part.     In Lattgalia, where the Russian officials are likely to have tried in 1897 to increase the number of White Russians at the expenee of the Letts, the unnatural increase of almost 100 per cent is no doubt the result of an under-statement on the part of the Russian officials and an over-statement on the part of the Letts. 3.    The Lithuanians.The Lithuanians inhabit the Government of Kovna, the northern, and by far larger part of the Government of Suvalki (H.Poland) and parts of the north-western districts of the Government of Vilna (Svientsany, Vilna and Troki).    They touch the Baltic in the district of Polangen, which only in 1817 was separated from Lithuania and joined to Courland.    Moreover, the north-eastern corner of Bast Prussia and also its eastern fringe are inhabited by Lithuanians (parts of the districts of Tilsit, Heidekrug, Hemel and Gumbinnen).     This is of course a very much smaller total region than that occupied by the &quot;historic&quot; Lithuania ab ove-ment i oned.The Lithuanians inhabiting Russia are almost all Roman Catholics, in East Prussia they are Lutherans.The census of 1897 put the number of Lithuanians in Russia at 1,659,000, of v/hich about a million inhabited the Government of Kovna, 280,000 the Government of Vilna and about 300,000 that of
Suvalki.    Their number in ftast Prussia was put by the German census of 1905 at about 100,000.    neither the Russian nor the German figures for the Lithuanians are reliable, and though ii would be equally risky to accept wholesale any of the estimates made by the Lithuanians themselves, the. official figures are most certainly under-estimates.4.     The White Russians.The White Russians inhabit the larger part of the Governmentsof Vilna and Grodna and praotioally the whole of Minsk, Vitebsk andMohilef.    Their language is but a dialeot of Russian and they themiselves are a branch of the Russian nation.   Had it not been for thecenturies during which they remained under Polish dominion, theWhite Russians would no more rank as a separate branch of theRussian nation than do the Great Russian peasants of Vologda orViatka, who apeak dialects of their own.    Had a proper system ofelementary education been introduoed by Russia when she regainedthese territories at the partitions of Poland, no one would nowthink of White Russian as a language.   Only in recent years haveattempts been made to develop a White Russian literary language.White Russian shades gradually through dialeots into Great Russianand Little Russian (in some western border districts the WhiteRussian dialects bear also marks of Polish influence).   In fact itis impossible to draw a lino between the White Russians and LittleRussians where they meet in the Government of Grodna in the midstof the biggest forests and marshes of Europe; villagos and settle-ments are practically cut off from one another, live their own lifeand speak their own tongue.    But any one who knows either GreatRussian or Little Russian will easily understand every single formof White Russian.By religion about four-fifths of the White Russians are Greek Orthodox, one-fifth, inhabiting the western parts of Vilna and Grodna, Roman Catholics.    The Poles have for centuries conducted a Roman Catholic or Uniate propaganda among the White Russians,just   as   among the   Little Russians,   trying to alienate
these tv/o branches of the Russian nation from the Great Russians. To the present day praotioally all the Roman Catholic priests in the V/hito Russian country are Poles or Polonised, and the vernacular part of the service is conducted in Polish, even though the peasants do not understand it.    The alien character of the Church has probably contributed towards rendering very slight the in-fluence of Christianity on the western White Russians who, in-habiting the wildest and most inaccessible parts of western Russia, have remained in their customs, beliefs and thinking the most pagan nation in Europe.     One thing, however,has been achieved by the Poles; the Roman Catholic Yfaite Russian calls his alien religion &quot;polish&quot; - with a view to census abuses a most convenient confusion of ideas.    Kinglake, having travelled about 1850 through what is now the kingdom of Bulgaria,, described his journey without making a single allusion to the existence o  the Bulgarian race - he had found only &quot;Greeks&quot;.     And yet it would be ludicrous to Suggest that the Bulgarian peasant ever considered himself a Hellene; by &quot;Greek&quot; he meant merely his religion.    Similarly a White Russian peasant, if he calls himself a &quot;Pole&quot; means to say that he is a Roman Catholic, not that he shares the nationality of his Polish landlord. There is in fact very little feeling for Poland, polish traditions and Polish history even among the Roman Catholic White Russians on the very border of Poland.The following table regarding the six governments of historicLithuania and Suvalki reproduces the results of the census of 1897,the only one which analyses the population by nationality;-Population in Thousands.Great Unite LittleRuss.

The Russian statistics no doubt under-state the number of Poles in Lithuania just as they do also with regard to the Lithuanians. But even less acceptable are the methods used and the figures given in the quasi-scientific Polish statistical works. They usually start by asserting or by silently assuming that every Roman Catholic White Russian is in reality a Pole. To reach more favourable results even the figures thus obtained require further treatment. They receive it, e.g., in the recently distributed "Problems of Central and Eastern Europe", 1917, the figures in which can? be easily disproved.

If we put the percentage of Poles in the three Governments of Vilna, Grodna and Kevna at an average of about 15%, we shall have conceded to them the most which can be conceded with justice, and perhaps even more.

There are no important mining districts or industrial centres either in the Baltio Provinces or in Lithuania. The country lives almost entirely on the produce of its agriculture and its farests, and whatever industry there is, is based chiefly on tne raw materials supplied by them. The only big town in the Baltio Provinces is Riga, with a population of about 500,000; the next biggest is the part of Libau with over 100,000; in Lithuania Vilna with about 200,000 inhabitants.

The Ests and Letts, the Lithuanians and White Russians are almost entirely peasant nations, and the land is the pivot of their life and thinking. It comes with them before religion and nationality; a peasant will forsake his God if that is the price at which he can acquire or retain acres (witness the French peasants, the Church lands and the Papal interdicts during the French Revolution). In the case of the Ests, Letts, Lithuanians and White Russians national interests coincide with their peasant passion for the land - the big landed estates in their countries are owned mainly by aliens,
Germans and Poles.History and Present Conditions: 1. Baltic Provinces.The history of the Lsts and Letts has been an endless struggle against the German &quot;Baltic Barons&quot;.     ITowhere in Eurdoe has serfdom been as ruthless as that imposed by the German con-ouerors in the Baltic Provinces, a fact admitted even by German historians.     i/hen towaris the end of the 18th century, Catherine ii tried to improve the conditions of the peasants, she met with the opposition, of the Barohs and failed.     &quot;The nobility,&quot; writes Dr. Seraphim, a fervent German patriot, in his Baltische Geschichte (1908),    &quot;consisted largely of retired officers in whom camp life had developed that contempt for other men which the difference of nationality had by itself implanted in them........ They resented the demands of the Empress as an unjustifiedand ruinous intrusion in their private affairs.&quot;    When in the reign of Alexander I the German Barons abolished serfdom in the Baltic Provinces, they declared the entire land their private property, whereas everywhere else in Eastern Europe, on the abolition of serfdom, part of the land was assigned to the peasants.     Moreover, all kinds of feudal privileges were retained, and in the pasts now under German occupation they survive to the present day (they were not abolished by Ukaee until 1916). Politically the German Barons were till about 1880 all-powerful in the Baltic Provinces.     Sxom among them came most of the German officials who filled the highest posts in the Russian army and civil service - the Osten-Sackena, the Meyendorffs, the Uexicfllls, etc., and these used the hold they had over the Russian Government for strengthening. still further their power in the Baltic Provinces.     The Landtags by which these Provinces were administered were exclusively in the hands of the noble land-owners; in Courland the Landtag was elected by about 500 voters?
In the Baltic Provinces the revolution of 1905 was a social andnational War of the Est and Lett peasants against the German land-lbrds whoi on the collapse of the revolution, directed the penalexpeditions in these Provinces, having first constituted them-selves into a &quot;voluntary constabulary&quot;.The following extracts from folksongs may serve to illustratethe feelings of the Lett peasants towards their German masters;&quot;The work for the master is hell, is hell, Nothing is lacking except the cauldron. Lords, Governors, buy therefore a cauldronJ&quot;X XX&quot;All the castles are on the hills, Our house is in the plain, It stands in the plain, In a morass of tears.&quot;X XX&quot;0 German,child of hell, Some day thou wilt be a beggar, And my own brothers will give thee A piece of bread.&quot;In the course of the 19th century the Est and Lett peasantry succeeded in redeeming from the German Barons about half the land of their country.    The other half is still divided into 462 big landed estates in Estland, 804 in Liviand and 648 in Courland. The biggest of the &quot;noble entails&quot;, Dondangen, covers no less than 250 square miles.     There is hardly another country in Europe where the peasantry is as highly educated as in the Baltic Provinces; there are practically no illiterates either among the Letts or the Ests.    And there is for the same reason hardly another peasantry which resents the rule of landlords more violently than they.    The average Est or Lett is by nature and training a revolutionary, and at the present day they supply the Bolsheviks with the most intelligent, best trained and best disciplined regiments.     But more than anything else in politics the Letts and Ests are anti-Germans.
g.   Lithuania.The hostility between the Lithuanian and $fhite Russian peasants on the one hand and the Polish landlords on the other is perhaps slightly less:violent than that which exists in the Baltic Provinces.    Yet it forma the dominating feature in the political life of the whole of historic Lithuania.    The Polish national interest in Lithuania reste mainly On the big manor houses, and the hold which they possess on the country.    Every Polish manor house is a Polish centre, the officials on the estate and many among the servants being Poles.    The one thing therefore which the Polish Nationalists oould never admit in Lithuania would be a &apos; thorough-going agrarian reform, whioh is the first point in the social and national programme of the Lithuanians and Unite Russians. When in April 1917 a V/hite Russian Peasant Congress met at Minsk, the Y/hite Russian peasants did not admit any plea in favour of Y/hite Russian autonomy, suspecting this to be a Polish idea invented by the landlords with a view to withholding the land from the peasants.    They demanded the closest union with Russia so that they might benefit from her agrarian reforms.     Puring recent months the parts of White Russia  behind the Russian front have been the scene of a most violent peasant revolt, and numerous manore have been sacked and burnt down.     In the parts under German occupation the Lithuanian and White Russian peasants are gnashing their teeth at the thought that because of the presence of German troops they cannot settle their accounts with their Polish landlords, and in the Polish press voices are raised, openly admitting that, should these Provinces be evacuated now, they would be threatened by an immediate peasant revolution.The author of &quot;problems of Central and Eastern Lurope&quot; (p.55) states that &quot;the Baltic Germans themselves are afraid of remaining face to face with the Letts and look for support from outside&quot;, and that for this reason &quot;in Courland now under German
escupation there has appeared among the German upper classes a leaning towards incorporation into Poland&quot;.     it seems quite likely that the Polish land-owning gentry both in Lithuania and Poland and the German Baarons in the Baltic Provinces feel a kind of comradeship for each other which exceeds national animosities, but as the Prussian power and the German armies are real, and the Polish power and the numerous Polish armiee merely vapouringfl of heated imaginations, the land-owning classes in  astern Europe will not find it difficult to ohoose their protector against the Bolshevik revolution which rages behind the Russian front and knocks at their own doors.     The peasant in revolt, who desires to seize the land, provides at present the one great anti-German force throughout the Baltic Provinces and historic Lithuania, and the potential ally of any one who fights Germany.APPENDIX.; Total population of the Baltic Provinces and the Lithuanian Governments according to the estimate for 1915 drafei up by the Russian Central Statistical Commission:-   &quot;Estonia 512,500Livonia 1,778,600 Courland        812,300Kovna 1,871,400Grodno 2,094,300Vilna 2,083,200Vitebsk 1,984,800Minsk 3,070,900Mohileff 2,551*400Suvalki 718,00014th February, 1918.
