This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)I circulate extracts from a report by Mr. Basil Thomson dealing with the activities of Maxim Litvinoff and Arnold Lupton. Attached to the Report are some interesting notes of Litvinoff&apos;s career.G. CAVE.20th February, 1918.The Pacifists have net had a good fortnight.    This may be due, partly to the aftermath of Count Hertling&apos;s speeoh, partly to the efforts of the War Aims Committee, and the various independent speakers who are doing their best t*, educate publio opinion among the working classes, and partly to the Bolshevist sympathies of many of the Pacifist speakers, for there is a decided anti-Russian feeling among British workmen.    The general feeling is that the Russians have &quot;let us down&quot;.    They do not distinguish very moch between one Russian and another A  but they are inclined to distrmst anyone who holds up Russian institutions &quot;for imitation.    George Lansbury, of &quot;The Herald&quot;, has been quick to notice this,: and in his issue of 9th February, he deprecates any attempt to introduce Bolshevism into England.     &quot;The Call&quot;, on the other hand, has an article entitled &quot;Learn to Speak Russian&quot;.     &quot;The working-class mustcome forward as one united whole, and assert its will in Russian acoents.........It should be an anti-Parliament, as the great Chartist conventions were, and then we shall soon see how easily Russian tan be spoken, evon in these islands, without the knowledge of grammar tr vocabulary&quot;.LITVINOFF.The activities of Maxim LITVINOFF, the Bolshevist representative in England, have become so sinister that I have thought it well to append to this report some notes about his career, and his secret activities during the last few weeks.    In my opinion, the time has come to consider very seriously the question of requiring him to leave this country, for had an accredited diplomatic representative committed half the indiscretions that he has been guilty of, his recall would have been asked for.    Besides inoiting the crews of Russian ships lying in a British harbour to rise and overpower their Officers, he has been inoulcating the same kind of doctrine among British soldiers, wh* are invited to his offioe for the purpose.    He is to address a Meeting in Westminster this evening, with Mr. Anderson, M.P., in the Chair. This was intended to be a small Meeting of 200 people, but the pressure was so great, that already some 2,000 tiokets have been issued.Litvinoff has appointed John MoLean, M.A., to be Bolshevist Consul for Glasgow.    This man belongs to the British Socialist Party.    He is an ex-Board School teacher, and at yne time was part Editor of the &quot;Vanguard&quot;.   He was arrested in Glasgow in March, 1916, and sentenced to three years1 penal
servitude for making seditious speeches.    He was released about the middleof June. 1917.     Since his release, he has made a few speeohea, from whichthe following may be quoted as a type of his style of oratory.-*When we entered the War, it was because of the violation of Belgium, they said, out it was really nothing of the kind;   it was to crush Demooraoy.&apos;     ........... King George is about as incompetent ashis imbeoiie cousin, the Czar of Russia ........... He had taught mostof the men who were responsible for the agitation on the Clyde, and he was pleased to say that the oream of tnem had been members of hisolass, and Marx s eoonomios had been well grounded into them..........After the War, there will be a greater exploitation of Labour than ever .ARNOLI LUPTON.Reference has been made in these reports to Mr. Arnold Lupton, sub-soriber to most of the Paoifist Societies.    He was apprenticed to a mining engineer, and for a time was a Colliery Manager.    For twenty- tne years he was Professor of Coal Mining at the Yorkshire College, Leeds University. He was Liberal Member for the Sleaford Division of Lincolnshire from 1906 to 1910.    On the 7th November, 1916, he waB fined  200 and 50 guineas Costa for publishing and distributing Paoifist pamphlets.     He appealedr but the appeal was dismissed with costs.     The conviction did not restrain his activities;   he continued to distribute Pacifist literature, and he was also found to be the chief promoter of a Society called the Free Trade League, conduoted by a man named Zusman, which was founded to promote trade with Germany after the War.    He was oharged at Bow Street on the 2nd February, for publishing a leaflet beginning &quot;Every day at the present time&quot;, and remanded.    On the 16th, he was sentenced to six months1 imprisonment in the Second Division.Further enquiries into the source of Mr. Arnold Lupton&apos;s considerable means have produced rather remarkable results.    It appears that early in 1913 he entered into relations with Hugo Stinnis and Gustav Nepper, the German oolliery ownerB.    A Company called the Northern Union Mining Company, with a capital of  500,000 was registered, in order to acquire coal leases in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.    Arnold Lupton received some  20,000 in oash, and  13,000 in shares.    The Company was wound up by the Board of Trade as an Enemy concern, on the 10th April, 1916.     It has lately oome to my knowledge, that Lupttn, working through an Agent, has been again in treaty to acquire mining leases, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that his Paoifist and Free Trade activities may have some relation to the interests of his German co-partners as well as to his own.     At any rate, it is the nearest approach to what has been termed &quot;Boloism&quot; that has yet oome to light in this country.
SuME NOTES ABOUT &quot;MAXIM LITVINOFF&quot; THE BOLSHEVIK AGENTIN LONDON.Litvinoff is a native of Baisk, a town in the Baltic Provinces.    He was barn of Jewish parents, his father being Merdeoai FINKELSTEIN, a shopkeeper who gave private lessens in Russian and Hebrew.    Litvinoff&apos;s real name, therefore, U David Mordeovitch FINKELSTEIN.     He attended a Russian County Seh*ol, and at the age of about sixteen years, began to associate himself with the Revolutionary Movement then prevailing in Russia,    His adventurous nature gained the confidence of hib colleagues in the &quot;Movement&apos;&apos;, and he began- a propaganda tour through Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Provinces.    The &quot;Movement-, however, found this tour too expensive, for he lived rather extravagantly, and he wab then for a time with-out employment, beyond what he could earn by giving private lessons in Russian,In 1901, he was said to have been imprisoned in K;j.eff for having a secret printing press for printing Social Democratic literature, and to have been sentenced to exile to Siberia for five years from 1903, for being one of the preminent members of the Kieff Committee.     He is believed to have escaped from prison in 1902, After the amnesty In 1905, he returned to Russia, furnished with a German passport in the name of Gustav GRAF.    At that time, gangb were being formed, under the name of &quot;Expropriators&quot; who, posing as anarchists or revolutionaries, began to attaok bankers and other wealthy people.    This role appeared to have suited David Finkelstein, and he is believed to have taken part in several robberies.    About 1907, the Russian Police Authorities Issued a description and photograph (a copy tf the latter is attached) of LITVANOFF, alias Vallach, alias Harrison, as having been concerned in a bank robbery at Tiflis, when 250,000 roubles were stolen. This photograph has been identified as that of Litvinoff.Before his activities as an &quot;Expropriator&quot; had been discovered, namely, in 1906, he left Russia- with the passport of Gustav Graf, for France, and soon after this, he arrived in London with a woman named Rosa MALKIN (the name of this woman&apos; 1b not quite certain) who got work as a clerk at the Russian. Information Bureau in Commercial Road.    She maintained Litvinoff for some months, in order that he might pick up the English language.     He then obtained employment as a.salesman cr Manager at a stationery and newspaper shop, known as &quot;The International Library&quot;, -in some side street off Tottenham Court Road.    He was then still known as David Finkelstein.    When he had learnt some English,.he applied for the post tf Secre-tary of the &quot;Gertzelski Kruzsok&quot;, a Russian group of political refugees, among whom were some of the leaders of the Russian Revolutionary Movement, suoh as Princes8 Boryatinskaia,   Kr^potkin, etc.    This body used to meet at.107, Charlotte Street.    As &quot;Finkelstein possessed documents proving his political activities in Russia, he was appointed Secretary, under the name of Mr. Harrison, and considerable sums of money passed through his hands.     The Russians pronounce &quot;H&quot; as &quot;GB, and his signature in Russian characters was at this time &quot;M.G. Garison&quot;.   At this time, he was still known at the International stationery shop as Finkelstein.It is said that in 1908 he was arrested in Paris, and in his lodgings were found some of the spoils of the. Tiflis robbery in 1906.About
About 1911, he was trading as importer of continental bocks and newspa from an address in the Marylebone district, under the names of Harrison and Buchman.     Some German firms knew him as Buchman;    in Prance he was known as Harrison.     About this time, he made the acquaintance of a Miss Low, believed t be a daughter of Mr. Sidney Lsw, an English girl with some journalistic aptitud He married her, and represented himself to her parents as a martyr to Freedom, and an exile from Rupsia.     He was received by the Lows and their friends with respect and sympathy, and under their influence he began to contribute English articles on Revolutionary subjects, which were corrected and improved by his wif In this way, he became popular among the Socialists, the Herald League, and othd Societies.A short time after the Russian Government Committee was formed, for the prj chase of War supplies, etc., he obtained work there in the Agricultural Departme and he kept this occupation until after the Revolution, namely, till July 1917, At this time, he seems to have adopted the name of Maxim Maximovitch Litvinoff. Under this name, he obtained the post as Manager of the &quot;Committee for Correct Information about New Russia&quot;, which was opened at Imperial House, Kingsway, As long as Kerensky&apos;s Government was in power, and Litvinoff felt that his posit at Imperial House was safe, and his salary secure, he posed as a strong anti-Bolshevik, but immediately after Kerensky fell, and the subsidy from the Russian Provisional Government was stopped, he began to show Bolshevist leanings at Imperial House, and he left.     He then became&apos;a member o5 the Russian Delegates Committee, where &quot;he worked in association with Tchitcherine at Finsbury House.At the Revolutionary Committee known as the &quot;Hertsel-Circle&quot; he used to meet Trotsky, .(then. known as Bronstein), Lenin, and Tchitcherine.     On the outbr of the Revolution, most of the members had returned to Russia, and the &quot;Circle&quot; ceased to exist.From a specimen of the work Litvinoff used to do at Imperial House, which now in my hands, it appears that he was employed on a precis of Russian newspape. opinion from day to day.The Russian Military Authorities became uneasy about him as early as 1915. He was supposed at that time to. be in communication with German Social Democrats but this has not been confirmed. He was, however, on intimate terms with KLYSKi who is employed in the Drawing Office at VickerB*, and he was therefore probably in a position to Bupply information if he wished to do so, . Klyshko is now in close association with him.Since his appointment as Representative of the Bolshevist Government in England, he has by no means confined himself within the limitations subscribed f diplomatic representatives.     He has been in close association with English Pacifists, and he addressed the Independent Labour Party at the Nottingham Con-ference.     He composed, and: circulated tc the Press, the Manifesto which appeared in the &quot;V/oalwieh Pioneer&quot; on the 8th February.    He has been trying, with somesuccess, to get British and American soldiers of Jewish desoent to visit his off: to induce them to engage in propaganda in their regiments. (A copy of this mani is appended on the last page). On one occasion, a few days ago, thirty soldiers wore soon in his office, namely, Royal Engineers, Canadians, and Americans,     Hispropaganda
i.244propaganda among ivorking men led to despatch of a telegram to the Prime Minister by the British Workers&apos; League at Walsall, urging that a stop should be put to his activities. *His latest exploit has been the engineering of a mutiny on board two Russian patrol vessels lying in the Mersey.     On the 6th February, two sailors from the patrol vessel &quot;PORYV&quot;, returned from a visit to Litvinoff in London. The spirit of the crew immediately became worse, and the unrest was communicated to the crew of the patrol vessel &quot;Razsvet&quot;.     Members of the crew stated that Litvinoff had received them very well, that he expressed astonishment on learning that Russian ships were lying at Liverpool, and that it was proposed to repatriate the crews.     He promised that they should return on their own vessels, concerning which he would telegraph to Petrograd, and he would supply them with money, coal, and water.     On Monday last, the 11th instant, mutiny broke out on the &quot;Razsvet&quot;, the crew of the &quot;Poryv&quot; having come on board.     At 2 o&apos;clbck, the Captain and Officers were summoned to the deck, and voices were crying out, &quot;Shoot the Officers&quot;.. Fortunately, a British Naval Officer came on board, and this probably saved the lives of the Russian Officers.     The Police were then summoned, and 120 men were removed from the two vessels to Police cells.     There, some of them made state-ments, incriminating Litvinoff.    They are all to be sent back to Russia, via Newcastle, on the 18th, being escorted to Newcastle by British Naval rating, the Home Secretary having made Deportation Orders against each one of them.To
