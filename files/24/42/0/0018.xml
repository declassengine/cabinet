To:- C.I.G.S.

Rostoff No.33 February 12th.

Report is current that Kaledin committed suicide yesterday afternoon.

I am afraid that the last two paragraphs of my telegram of yesterday&apos;s date are misleading, they were merely intended to indicate how small an affair had become the hope of doing anything with the fleet. Korniloff mentioned the subject only upon being questioned and his idea of attacking Novorossisk must be quite subsidiary, as both he and Alexieff have always talked of Ekaterinodar as a mere talking place and of effecting their ultimate retreat in the opposite direction.

The south eastern federation, of which Rostoff is for the moment the capital will ?now ?dissolve and I recommend that Petrograd Embassy be cabled to stop the sending of any officers ?requested.

Unable repeat Barclay.
