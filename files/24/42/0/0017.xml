Colonel Jenes[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1918.HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES AFTER THE WAR.Memorandum by the President of the Local Government Board.I SUBMIT for the consideration of my colleagues the following statement on the question of the Housing of the Working Classes at the end of the war. The problem is admittedly one of the most important and pressing of those that call for prompt preparatory measures, so that immediate action may be taken at the close of the war. The previously existing shortage of houses has notoriously been aggravated&apos;by war conditions, building having practically ceased in the last two 3^ears. The demand for more and better housing accommodation on demobilisation will be irresistible, while the provision of large numbers of houses will operate as a factor in reducing the risk of unemployment attendant on the return to peace condi-tions I ask for an early decision to enable me to follow up, by the immediate issue of the Circular letter annexed, the negotiations with the Local Authorities which the War Cabinet authorised me to initiate so long ago as the 24th July last. The Local Authorities are in a mood to respond to the call, and are becoming impatient at the delay.On the 24th July last the War Cabinet decided that &quot; .... it will be necessary to afford substantial financial assistance from public funds to those Local Authorities who are prepared to carry through, without delay, at the conclusion of the war, a programme of housing for the working classes which is approved by the Local Government.Board/&apos;On the 28th of that month I issued a Circular and Questionnaire to all Local Authorities under the Housing Acts announcing this decision, and inviting them to state the circumstances and needs of their districts in regard to housing and what they and others were prepared to do to meet them. Returns have been received from 1,495 out of 1,806 Local Authorities.These returns indicate a need for some 300,000 houses in England and Wales and willingness on the part of the Local Authorities to erect some 150,000 with sub-stantiai financial assistance from the Exchequer. They further indicate the inten-tion of certain societies and persons to provide houses in some districts at the close-of the war.On the 19th October I submitted certain proposals to the Treasury for giving financial assistance to the Local Authorities, being the recommendations of the Advisory Conference on Housing set up by my predecessor, Lord Rhondda. These proposals were not accepted by the Treasury, but that Department last month put forward proposals of their own which have since been modified to meet points raised by me.These proposals (which are set out in the Appendix to this Memorandum) I am prepared to adopt, and 1 hope they may be regarded by Local Authorities as reason-ably satisfying the promise of substantial financial assistance given in July last.Meanwhile the Minister of Reconstruction has had a \ Pan el sitting on -the housing question, which has put forward/scheme which, I think, may be described      a in outline as follows :-- &apos;Local Authorities are to build, as agents for the State, and manage the houses, also as agents, for five years from the date of completion. At the end of that time the Local Authorities are to be compelled to take Over the houses at the price which it is estimated it would then cost to build them.   The balance[251] B
of cost would be borne by the State. Power is to be reserved to the central authority to build and manage if the Local Authority refuse, but at the end of five years the compulsory transfer takes effect as regards all houses.The Local Authorities under this scheme will be the Councils of counties and county boroughs and the Councils of boroughs above 10,000 population and of urban districts above 20,000. Those authorities who have not any necessary town-planning or rating powers, &amp;c, are to have those powers conferred upon them for the purpose. England and Wales are to be divided up into districts, and Commissioners are to be appointed for these districts who will decide, sub-ject to the directions of the Local Government Board, the number of houses to be provided and settle plans, lay out, and contracts. Architects and other staff will be attached to them. There will also be a panel of architects paid by the State, who can be employed by the Local Authorities free of charge.During the five years rents are to be fixed by the Local Government Board acting through the Commissioners, and collected and paid over by the Local Authority to &quot;the State. In urban districts they are to be economic rents as near as may be, and in rural districts they are to be raised by stages, in co-operation with the Wages Board, to a similar figure. At the end of that period the rents must, if possible, be sufficient to cover in each case annual charges coming upon the Local Authority. Steps are to be taken to secure that wages will be paid to cover rents.Power is to be given to the central authority to defer the date of the transfer of the houses. (Presumably this means the date of&quot; the determination of the cost of building similar houses at the end of the transition period.)The Secretaries for Scotland and Ireland, the President of the Board of Agri-culture and Fisheries, the Minister of Reconstruction and myself have had various conferences on the matter, but we have not reached any agreement.The proposal involved in the scheme put forward by the Ministry of Recon-struction appears to me to invite criticism on many grounds.In the first place, it makes the Government responsible for providing the number of houses which may be found to be necessary an undertaking which, in my opinion, it is most unlikely that they will be able to carry into effect in consequence largely of shortage of materials and money. I feel that it would be a grave mistake for the Government to take this serious responsibility upon themselves unless there is no alternative, for it is a responsibility which must grow, and its growth could not, in my opinion, be checked before it had landed us in disaster.The scheme as it stands is the most expensive to the State which has been put forward, and may, and is supposed to, relieve the Local Authorities from all risk. It might on this ground commend itself to them. They will certainly regard other aspects of the scheme as objectionable. It involves legislation compelling them to take over houses, the number, sites, and types of which are finally settled by the central authority or its commissioners. Such legislation must be controversial, and the proposal to oust the smaller Local Authorities from their position under the Housing Acts and to substitute the County Councils adds to the subjects of conten-tion. When is such legislation to be passed ? It cannot be delayed, for the neces-sary schemes must be prepared without delay if we are to be ready to build at the end of the war.Apart from this important point, the position of the Local Authorities in rela-tion to the State under such a scheme needs consideration. The cue of the Local Authorities is obvious; they will say, &quot; We don&apos;t want so many houses: we don&apos;t agree as to site, and we don&apos;t think the type of house you suggest is suitable.&quot; The Local Authorities, according to the Panel Report, are to be used during the transi-tionf*4 period to collect rents, and as the whole deficit is to be met by the State there is no immediate inducement to the Local Authorities to be harsh in the matter of arrears and defaulters or the raising of rents. For any prosecutions in this clirec-tion, and the consequent evictions, the State takes the sole responsibility, and at the end of the emergency period of five years the Local Authorities can, without any loss to themselves, put themselves in a position to point to the warnings they originally gave as to the excessive number of houses, the imsuitability of the sites and the houses, and the results in lowered rents and empty houses. Even, therefore, if the controversial legislation becomes law in the first instance, it may be almost impossible to compel Local Authorities to take over the houses built five years previously %t the price of new ones, as this scheme suggests.
APPENDIX.Local Government Board,Whitehall, S.W. 1., 1918.Sir,1. I am directed by the President of the Local Government Board to advert to the Circular letter of the 28th July, 1917, in regard to the provision of houses for the working classes at the conclusion of the war.2. In that letter it was stated that the Government recognised that it would be necessary to afford substantial financial assistance from public funds to those local authorities who were prepared to carry through, without delay, at the conclusion of the war, a programme of housing for the working classes approved by the Board, but it was not possible at the time to indicate the form which the financial assistance from the State would take or the extent of it. The President has been in communica-tion with the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury on the subject,&apos;and in regard to the financial assistance which may be granted by the State to Local Authorities carrying but housing schemes under Part TII of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, as soon after the conclusion of the war as funds are [251] &quot; &apos; &apos;       &quot;    B 2.AThe movable date for the -taking over of the houses is no doubt properly regarded as an essential point of the scheme, but the opportunity for pressure on the Govern ment, who are bearing all losses during the transition period, can hardly be exaggerated.&apos; For these reasons I am convinced it would be unwise to adopt the scheme which the Minister of Reconstruction has had under consideration, and, as the matter is one of great urgency, I ask permission to communicate to Local Authorities, in the form of the Circular letter set out in the Appendix to this Memorandum, the pro-posals indicated above upon which the Treasury and my Department are in agree-ment. I shall then be in a position to inform them of the Treasurer decision as regards the nature and extent of the financial assistance, adding a warning as to the possibility that money and materials may be short. I shall at the same time invite them to submit their schemes and get everything ready for action when action is possible. We shall then see where we are and how much of the problem can be solved, when money and materials are available, by the Local Authorities.I do not, however, intend to rest entirely on the good will of the existing Local Authorities, for I have had a Bill prepared which enables me, after hearing them, to replace the existing Local Authorities by County Councils without formal proof of default where the Local Authority have not taken adequate steps to exercise their powers of providing houses. By the same Bill I am proposing to give better facili-ties to County Councils to provide houses for their employees, and thus to some extent meet in another direction the housing problem in rural, and particularly agricultural, districts.At the same time, I am most anxious to go to considerable lengths in an endeavour to keep alive private enterprise, which in the past has provided at least 95 per cent, of the working-class houses of this country. The whole matter is now before my Housing Advisory Conference and the Ministry of Reconstruction, and I shall hope shortly to be able to submit some proposals which should prove of material assistance to public utility societies and other forms of private enterprise.I believe my present proposals have the general support of my colleagues, the Secretary for Scotland, the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I trust that the War Cabinet will agree to give me authority to proceed with them without further delay, for in this matter time is of the utmost importance, and I must again emphasise that the Local Authori-ties and others are becoming restless owing to the failure of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to make a decisive move.W. HAYES FISHER.Local Government Board, Whitehall,February 1918.
available, or within a reasonable period thereafter, their Lordships have laid down the following principles, namely:-The full cost of the scheme should, in the first instance, be met out of the funds of the Local Authority by means of a loan to be raised by them and for a sefia&amp;e? of years, which my Lords think should not be less than seven, the necessary State assistance should be given in the form of a grant of a percentage of the loan charges sufficient to relieve the authority of 75 per cent, of the estimated annual&apos; deficit; the deficit in each case should be estimated, with due regard to the actual increase in the cost of construction in the particular locality, on the basis of the estimatec^expenditure, and the estimated annual income over a period of years; the interest charge on loan moneys should be taken at the amount actually paid where loans are raised from an outside source specifically for the purpose, or at the current market rate where the money is provided from accumulated funds in the hands of the Local Authority. At the end of the period above referred to the property should be valued, and 75 per cent, of the excess (if any) of the amount of the loan outstanding over the then value of the property should be met by the State, either by writing off a portion of the outstanding liability (if the money was borrowed from State sources), or by the Government undertaking responsibility for the appropriate proportion of the loan charges for the remainder of its currency. Any loans by the State for the purpose of assisted schemes would be made at the full market rate of interest current from time to time, and not at the preferential rates ordinarily allowed for housing loans, in order (1) that the whole of the State assistance may be. given under one head, and (2) that Local Authorities may be encouraged to borrow on their own credit rather than to have recourse to State capital funds.3. The President has alwavs taken the view that in this matter there must be a partnership between the State and the Local Authorities, and he was not -disposed to contend that as regards most Local Authorities the extent of the assistance which the Treasury proposed to give in accordance with the above principle was inadequate generally. He felt, however, that cases might arise, especially in agricultural areas, in which the sharing by Local Authorities in the contemplated deficit, even to the extent of 25 pefr cent., might prove a somewhat heavy burden. He accordingly represented to the Treasury that in these cases he should be empowered to allow a further proportion of the burden to be placed on the State, and made certain sugges-tions with this, object. He is glad to be able to state that he has been sympathetically met by.the Treasury in this matter.  They have now stated as follows:- My Lords are willing to agree that the Board should have discretion in cases in which 25 per cent, of the deficit in respect of any scheme would exceed the produce of a rate of a penny in the   on the area chargeable, to increase the grant to 100 per cent, less the produce of a rate of a penny in the  .4. The President trusts that this announcement of the terms proposed in regard to State financial assistance will have the result of inducing Local Authorities generally to proceed with the preparation of housing schemes without delay.5. Owing to the financial exigencies of the time, and the number of sublets-for which money will be required by the State, the assistance-available must, ft is feared, be limited in amount as well as in time, and one object of the Government will naturally be to secure the erection of as many houses as practicable where they are most urgently required.6. In communicating their proposals for financial assistance, their Lordships expressly ask that it niay be made quite clear that the precise date at which the execution of any schemes approved by the Board can be commenced must depend on circumstances which cannot at present be foreseen, and that the financial position may be such that it may be necessary to give precedence to the more urgent cases, even to the exclusion for the time being of the less urgent.... 7. The President thinks that he ought again to emphasise the fact that it is only in the very exceptional circumstances of the national emergency that the Government are proposing to give substantial financial assistance to Local Authorities for the execution of housing schemes.8. In response to the Circular letter of the 28th July, the Board have received up to the present time returns from over 80 per cent, of Local Authorities under the
Housing Acts. Originally it was requested that the returns should be furnished by the 15th October, 1917, in the case of Local Authorities desirous of availing them-selves of any financial assistance from the State in aid of housing schemes, but the Board wish it to be understood that proposals from Local Authorities, even if they have not hitherto sent in returns, will be duly considered if returns are sent in with-out undue delay. They understand that some Local Authorities have not moved in the matter in the absence of any indication as to the form and extent of the State assistance, but this objection is removed by the above announcement. Although the information furnished in many of the returns is not of such a definite character as could have been desired, the Board are glad to note that in no less than 880 cases Local Authorities have stated that they have prepared, or are preparing, or willing to prepare, schemes for the erection of some 150,000 houses by them.9. In these circumstances the Board think it desirable to communicate to Local Authorities generally some points of general application which it will be necessarv to bear in mind in connection with their housing schemes. To some extent these will not apply to the Local Authorities in the County of London.10. The Board will require to be furnished with the information, plans, &amp;c, indicated in the enclosed Form D. 18,, and with the balance sheet in Form D. 18a. In framing the balance sheet it will be desirable at present to calculate the amount of the loan charges on the rate of interest now in force for loans by the Public Works Loan Commissioners in respect of housing, namely, 5^ per cent. Any necessary correction on this point, as well as in regard to the amount of the capital expenditure in connection with tne scheme, can be made at later stage. The Board recognise that, in the first instance, only an approximate estimate can be given in regard to the amount of such expenditure.11. The scheme must be prepared in relation to a particular site which the Authority have selected as being the most suitable site available for the purpose, and it should be borne in mind that in connection with schemes intended to secure Government assistance, the aim should be to provide, that in ordinary circumstances, not more than twelve houses (or in agricultural areas, eight houses) should be placed on an acre of land wherever this is possible without materially increasing the cost of the scheme.12. In view of the restrictions placed upon the raising of loans by Local Authorities during the continuance of the war, it is desirable that the Local Authorities should endeavour to make such arrangements for the&apos;acquisition of land as will not involve ine payment of the purchase money until after the war, and that and provisional agreement entered into by the Authority should stipulate that the purchase money should not be required to be paid until the Board have sanctioned the borrowing thereof. In only very exceptional circumstances could the Board sanction loans for the purpose during the war, and then only for very small amounts or for a proportion of the purchase money.13. If it is found that, when prepared, the housing scheme fails to comply in any respect with the bye-law7s in force in the district in which the houses are to be built, attention should be specially drawn to the points in respect of which the bye-laws are not complied with, and in order to save time, a statement should be fonvarded to the effect that, in the event of the plans being approved, and if/an amendment of the bye-laws, similar schemes could be authorised to be carried ouf?by any other body, or persons, in future, the appropriate Local Authority will be pre -pared to make application to the Board for approval to any amending bye-law which may be necessary for that purpose.14. It will be a condition of any financial assistance given by the Government that the erection of the houses shall be commenced within two months from the date of their sanction to any loan, and that the houses shall be completed by a date fixed, not being more than twelve months from the date of sanction unless circumstances are very exceptional. Provision will, however, be made in the conditions for an extension of the term where circumstances necessitate this.15. The Board have issued a revised Memorandum wTith respect to the provision by Local Authorities of houses for the working classes, including twelve designs ia regard to the arrangement of the rooms. &amp;c, in such houses. A copy of this Memorandum has been, or will be, forwrarded to each Local Authority that, sd far as the Board are aware, is willing to proceed with the preparation of a housing scheme, and to any other Local Authority that applies for the same. Further^ copies may be obtained from the sources indicated on the title page of the Memorandum.
16. The Board desire at the same time to state that by their request the Royal Institute of British Architects are conducting a competition for suitable designs for houses of the working classes, the result of which will be announced in due course. Also a Committee, appointed by the President, is now considering questions of build-ing construction in connection with the provision of dwellings for the working classes in England and Wales, and is to report upon methods of securing economy and despatch in the provision of such dwellings. The report from this Committee is expected shortly.17. In regard to the question of materials required for the erection of buildings and the construction of works after the war, a Committee appointed by the Minister of Reconstruction is engaged in a comprehensive investigation of the subject.18. The President trusts that in regard to each district in which there is an admitted need for provision of additional houses for the working classes, which the Local Authority are of opinion will not be met by any form of private enterprise, the Local Authority will at once give instructions for the preparation of a housing-scheme if this has not already been done, and submit the proposals to the Board with as little delay as possible. In those cases in which schemes have already been submitted, including many for which loans were sanctioned prior to or during the early months of the war, but not proceeded with, it will be necessary to reconsider the schemes in view of existing circumstances, and in the light of the foregoing observations, particularly those in paragraph 11, and it would be of great con-venience to the Board in connection with such reconsideration to receive from the Local Authorities concerned the Forms D. 18 and D. 18a above mentioned duly filled up, together with any amended plans and particulars that the altered cir-cumstances require.I am, Sir,Your obedient servant,Assistant Secretary.
