Colonel Joness .Ji^MjP1J^B3 ,^^SHTY Of HIS BRITAINIG MAJBS TY1 3 GOVERNMENT,)S EC R E To,WAR     CABINET,ECUS TITO 03? THE WORKING CIAS SES AFTER TEE WAR.Memorandum by tho Chief Secretary for Ireland.The memoranda circulated by the President of the Local Government Beard and the Secretary for Scotland as to the necessity for specific action in regard to the housing&apos; ox the working classes after the War, deal with-a problem which is probably more urgent in some parts of Ireland than in any other part of the United Kingdom,     The needs of Dublin have&apos; often been brought to the attention of the Government;*   there is a formidable shortage of artisans1 dwellings in Belfast,.-and in almost all-of the smaller Irish towns.   A large pro-portion of the population are housed in slums which could not be matched in Great Britain^In every instance in Ireland which I have personally investigated the work ahead in tho business of housing the poorest classes is hopelessly beyond the resources of the local authoritiesc   Private enterprise is out cf the question for the present.     In many of the towns the great majority of the inhabitants aro by reason of poverty outsido of any con-ceivable scheme of direct taxation.,The adoption of national Housing Proposals for England and Scotland will I think involve a similar proceeding with regard to Ireland.     The uncertainty whioh exists as to the future of Irish Government will not relieve Parliament, as matters now stand, from the necessity of dealing with tho housing problem.     what is really to be decided seems to me to be the question of what is most prudent under the circumstances.After discussing the relative merits of the schemes proposed respectively by the Minister of Reconstruction and the President of the Local Government Board, I have come to the conclusion that the latter is best adapted under existing circumstances to meet the case of Ireland. -(Signed) .   H.E.DUZB. -Hist February, 1918.
