SECRET.(This Documdn* in tho Pjuptsrty&apos;TiTHis 9ritannio Majesty&apos;s Government)&quot; A SHORT HOTS PASSAT       AT XOIS Iff THE HBJAZ,7- iIt has possibly &quot;been considered in some quarters that Britain is not getting her &quot;money&apos;8 worth&quot; out of the svolt in the Hejasj&quot; and that so far there has practically visible result it return for a large expenditure of stores and munitions.     This according to European ideas -&quot;fa very possibly true but if one could look at the results through Arab &quot;spectacles&quot; a very different aspect would appear.It would be as well here to study the respective positions of the Turkisk and Arab forces in the Hejaz at the outbreak of the revolt in the summer of 1916.The Turks were garrisoning the province of the Hejaz with a picked garrison of trained disciplined troops, v/ell equipped with guns, arms, ammunition and supplies which was brought up to a strength of about 25,000 men.They held the whole, of the Hejaz Railway from Maan to Hedina, had strong garrisons at Taif and:Pf&apos;.dca. and occupied the coast line with garrisons at Jeddah, Yembo, tfejh, and Akaba.     Their communications with their forces in Syria by means of the railway line were intact.The Arab forces on the other hand, although numerically strong, had no guns and no department to organise supplies. They had practically no small arms, ammunition nor equipments In July 1916 Sherif Peisal had three camps of 10,000&apos;men each but no single camp had as many as 2,000 rifles.     There was no organisation of any sort, each contingent coming in under its own Sheikh whom it might or might not obey according to circumstances.   They, of course, had no experience in anything approaching modern warfare, their training being oonfined to periodical inter-tribal raids in which the main idea is loot and carry the spoils home as quickly as possible.Although the Sheriffs banner was first raised in rebellion against the Turkish rulers of Arabia on July 4th, one may datt the actual beginning of the movement from the proclamation of the Grand Sherif of Liecca to the world on July 7th.     In this document after reoiting how the C.U.P. had oppressed Hejaz, dishonoured Islam, desecrated the grave of Abdel ICader, executed the leading men of the Arab race and and damaged the Kaaba at i;ecca and the Holy Places, the Sherif announced that he declared himself and his subjects henceforward independent of the C.U.P. and intended to return to the striot law of Islam and to the rule of his people in the true faith of Ilahomet.     This declaration of independence was at once followed by armed action,     The whole of the Hejaz which was under the Sheriffs immediate sway&apos; rose against the Turkisk garrisons,    Lecca was surrendered on July 10th, then Umlej on August 16th, Taif on September 23rd; &apos; while Kunfuda had in July been    Raptured by the forces of Idrisi of Asir,    At the same time several attempts on the part of the garrison at Medina, the H*Q. of the Turkish Expeditionary Forces, to break out1 southwards and march on Lecca were repulsed by the Sherff*%&apos; forces.     The latter were organised in three groups^j*.ach under one of his sons, Ali, Abdulah, and Feizal; totalling somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 men including 2,000 Camelry^     As has always been the c^se with Arab armies the numbers vary&quot;from day to day and a good many more men were being paid and-fed at any given time than could actually be brought Into the field; as a fighting force&quot;th^ os*eBBed-^the vices of Cuerilla troops^ with the extra qualifications of religious and racial prejudice and Arab temperament!In,
In so far as any oonnected military plan was fortheoming it consisted in 4 distant blotkade of Medina and its garrison, at one time about 13,000 Btrong, tombined with spasmodic attempts to out the Hejaz railway.    Broadly speaking the army of Ali, about 8,000 strong at its maximum, faced Medina on the south and blocked the roads leading to Yembo Rabegh and Mecoaj the army of Abdullah, 4,000 or so encircled the city on the east and northeast, to cut off any supply or relief from the Tribal allies of Turkey in that direction, a task whioh was not fulfilled aompletelyj while Ptisal^s army, 8,000 to 9,000 men, the strongest and best of the three, based first on Yembe. operated against the Turks and the railway from the frouth*west and west.Mshri Pasha, the G*0.0, at Medina was unable to take advantage of the critical period from September, 1916&quot;, to January 1917. when the Sherif became alarmed at the Turkish preparations for the recovery af Mecca and the question of the despatch cf a British brigade to hie assistanoe was seriously:Considered.     It wab recognised that this would be a desparate remedy which everyone oonoerned was roluatant to adopt, in&quot; view of the irreparable disaster to the prestige of the new Kingdom, if it wero &quot;Based on infidel arms, and these objections supported by the appreciation of Turkish difficulties carried the day.Time prove,d to be on the side of the Arabs.     in January Feisal felt himself strong enough to leave the defence of the southern roadB to Ali, and moved northwards to raise the tribes on the Turkish communications between Medina and Maan.     Wejh was taken with British naval assistanoe on January 29th, 1917, and the immediate effect was seen in the Turks drawing in their horns at Medina and reorganising their forte for the defence of the railway.    At the end of April, 1917, Akaba was successfully raided by the Navy, and the adhesion of the tribes along the R^d Sea Littoral in that neighbourhood! augmented the strength and striking power of Feisal*s forse,*    The Arab movement was not affected by the first two battles of Gaza but despite the increase in the number and effectiveness of the raids on the railway the $urks, in faoe of great supply difficulties continued, by evacuating part of the civil population of Medina, by the strictest eoonomy and use of all the looal resouroas to their fullest extent, to maintain    hsmselves in Medina, which the Arabs are unwilling to capture &quot;by storm, and to prevent more than temporary severance 62 their line of o6mmunication.     There is also little doubt that they obtained a sertain amount ogof supplies from Nejef and Koweit,The Hejaz railway line has nearer been cut for more than at most, a continuous period of ten days which is not long enough tp affect the supply question deoisively though it causes the Turks Berious inconvenience.     The -Arabs themselves will not fire a shot at the Holy City itself, nor permit anyone else to do so, and the reduction of Medina therefore will have t8 be by starvation.     In this sonneaticn the Turkish Commander Fakhri Pasha is known to falsify his returns and probably has more food than h* admits or is known, including a large supply of dates which although unpleasant as the sole diet would suffice to keep the garrison for some months.Despite this factor the situation has steadily grown worse for the Turks who have been able to find no organised foroe within their rea4h at whish to strike and who have suffered a series of mincer lyreraae in detail whith have had a demoralising effect on Wtfh men and commanders.Jemal
Jemal Pasha was quick to see the danger to the Turkish force in the Kejaz which would he involved in the British capture of Jerusalem^ and after the fall of Gaza while the British forces were still within striking distance of Jerusalem in November, 191.7, Fakhri pasha, the Turkish commander in Medina, was advised of the decision to evacuate Mediaa (of all but a small garrison), and the Hejaz railway south of Maan.     An elaborate seventy five days programme to commence on December 1st was drawn up, to arrange for supplies of food and fuel for the Turkish forces during the evacuation. This programme for which 20 locomotives and 300 wagons were allotted has by now,fallen very much behind time despite German assistance in the management.     This as due vo various causes, among which are, the congestion on the line during December owing to large troop movements from Damascus to Deraa, the wash-out of improvised repairs to many parts of the line, notably near Tebuk, caused by heavy floods in December, and the offensive operations of Sherif Feisal&apos;s. army,This force at the beginning of January occupied the Hish forest, north-west of Maan, with its .. supply of firewood;&apos; it then moved to the railway at Jauf JSd Derwish which was held for three days and a large stretch of the line damaged.     Tafile was occupied about January 10th, from which place the grain growing district of Kerek is threatened, and a Turkish force of 3 battalions with 27 machine guns and a battery of quick firing mountain guns attempting the recapture of Tafile from Kerak/ was almost totally destroyed on January 26th-     El Mezraa, on the Dead Sea, on the road to Kerak, was captured by the Arabs on January 31st and there are..now various indications of movement of Turkish units from the no^th. to Amman, Madeba, &apos;Kutrani, and Kerak, in order to counter this Arab advance.In conclusion it is apparent that the Arabs have succeeded at small cost to us in holding up a eonsidr&amp;ble force (now at least 22,000) of Turks as well as in demobilising rolling stock which could have otherwise been used against General Allenby,&quot; and that they have in fact done far more than could ever have been expected of them.General Staff, War Office,10th February, 1918.
