(phosphorous), TOTAL. 1,924 lb.700 rounds were fired at targets on the ground.Accurate shooting was impossible owing to the darkness.However the leading machine dropped a phosphorous bomb on theytarget which caused a blaze of light covering an area of a quarter of a mile square.

Bombs were seen to burst well on the Station and Junction but it was impossible to observe results.The majority of the pilots report that the Foundries to the North of Metz were well lit up, but these were doused soon after our machines crossed the lines.   All lights at Courcelles were quickly extinguished, and pilots could not observe any traffic on the Sidings 0There were considerable A,A. Defences, but the shooting was bad and erratic.
