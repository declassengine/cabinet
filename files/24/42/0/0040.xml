&quot; T^T^ST 1 - Colonel Jones-j 4 a-  ::        I (This Document is the Property ofI &apos;V Hit Britannic Majesty^ Government.)be. / -[I  I I WJ febe 8 .14, 1918a.^T^TS^SaBK.     Arrangements are now virtually completed for theJoint supervision, by H.M. Government and the united States Wsrji Trade Board, of American exports to the northern European neu-  J I trale.   *t is not yet decided whether, under the new system,the guarantees of such neutral associations as the i*.G.ri. will   I be accepted-    She Americans have suggested, as an alternative,, j that guarantees should be issued by a representative of the Allied powers in the country of destination;   but we should naturally prefer to rely upon the organisations through which wej have exercised our control in the past,Bow that provisional agreements have been made with swedehjy ijjand the **etherlands, we ere proposing that the general embargoIon imports into those countries should be relaxed, so far asIcertain named articles ere concerned. 2ho articles in question   ji I&apos; era of no military importance and many of them are at presentBl &apos; illj.;     &apos;        exported from Germany to these two countries *   -Is hope in this   l way to diminish the volume of Semen export trade and to prevent!her from acquiring a monopoly of valuable, markets for the future,jI 1Our proposal is under consideration at if ashing ton;    but the1United states Government appear to be in favour of maintaining I .T the general embargo *1 ill&apos;ESSBIA*   SJhe German manufacturers of ploughs have been instructed     Jthat &quot;all their etocfcs which are not required  or $eriaany andI iAustria-Hungary must be reserved for export to the Ukraine.She Sera an press appear to have been informed that thejl Ukraine is able to supply one   million tons of grain immediately JI a sure source reports that ell purchases of Ukraine produce,I vo&amp;ev       economic treaty with the Central Powers, will be j
arranged by the German Government, so that competition may be avoided and the agreed rates of exchange observed.The Supplies Committee of the Archangel region are anxious to open trade with the. United kingdom.   They offer the natural products of Western Siberia and 13.W. Kuaaia in exchange for saltt. coffee, rice, tea, coke, cement and boot oh herrings,   lie should prefer to take in payment the war stores of British and American origin (about 200,000 tons in all) which are now lying at Archangel.SWKDEii.      The Swedish Btate Railways are refusing or delaying to transport goods intended for the United kingdom,   ihey demand compensation for such services in the form of ooal, although we are already supplying them with 6,000 to 9,000 tons a week, sad have offered to ma&amp;e further deliveries when the $hipping Ag&amp;ee-ment is concluded,   f?e are protesting a&amp;aiast this unfriendly action.The German deliveries of ooal to Sweden are still very in-adequate.   For 1917 they only amounted to 1,700,000 tons as against 4,381,000 tons in 1916.   The deliveries in January were 165,000 tons.   It is believed that some of the German ships em-ployed in this trade will shortly be diverted into the trade with the Kussian Baltic provinces, and that the Swedes will be requir-ed to fetch ooal from Germany in their own vessels.   But Qemany is making great efforts to supply Sweden with steel and iron, es-pecially for the building of merchant ships.aoitWAX.   The united states War Trade Board have gone much further than m expected or desired towards m&amp;etigg, the views of the Norwegian Government with regard to the proposed economic agree-raent.   Dr. H an sen has been Informed that Norway would be per-aitted to supply the Germans with specified quantities of calcium
carbide, coloium nitrate. ferro-silioon, iron ore, zinc, alumin-ium, felspar and sons other commodities of less importance.   It Is no doubt advisable that the allies should avoid a breach with Bor??ay.   Her shipping is important to us, and her factories supply France and Great Britain with materials which are almost if not quite indispensable for the manufacture of munitions and military supplies.   But in the opinion of Sir M. i-indlay the United utates are conceding raore than is necessary.   The &amp;or-wegian Government have been as&amp;ed to accept or reject the A&amp;ree-ment, in its amended form, by March Z.   They ore at present communicating with Berlin on the subject.The Christiania money market has not &quot;been much affected bythe news of the peace signed between the Ukraine arid the CentralrosePowers.   The mark-r&amp;te/at Christiania, between Feb. B and Feb. 11 froTyt 56.75 to 68.50, but relapsed to its original level on Feb. IE.   In Stockholm and Copenhagen the markets were more sensitive.   At Copenhagen the mark-rate rose, between Feb. 6 and Fob. 1&amp; from 59.50 to 64;   at Stockholm in the sterns period It rsoe from 54.50 to 60.&apos;  pTHKhLiHJ&amp;S.   H.M. Government have provisionally raised the embargo oil Dutch commercial cables.   The transit traffic in sand and gravel has ceased for the time being, and eannot be resumed before March 15.   is M, Loudon now admits that his Qovornm&amp;nt are bound to prohibit the passage oi these materials, when they are -intend-ed for military uee in Belgium or northern France, it should not be difficult to arrange a final settlement of this question before the traffic is resumed.On Fob, 7 the Dutch Government permitted the export of 280 horses to Germany.   We have protested;   but a. London contends that, under the economic agreement between Holland and Germany, he is powerless to stop this trade.
-The main lines of a Comes rcial Agreement between ispain and the United states have now been arranged. She United States agree to supply Spain with 35,000 bales of eotton and 8,000 tons of petroleum. Spain will be required to conclude with Ifranpe the financial agreement which has been under discussion for some time; and also to place a certain amount of tonna&amp;e at the ais-posal of the United States  hipping jsoard.Licences to export from the United  in&amp;dom to &amp;pain are only being granted in cases where Spanish  Oods are pffered in exchange for the British exports,$he Spanish Government recently requisitioned 100,000 tons of Spanish shipping.   About half the vessels in question were en-gaged in carrying ore to the United Kingdom, and we are consequent ly short of tonnage for this essential trade.Xf&amp;liyyjlit.   tke Swiss Government are prepared to negotiate with the Allies for a reduction of their cotton exports to Germany. If they protract the negotiations unreasonably the Paris Eationing Committee will probably be asked to take action in the matter.Ho Jute is to b$ exported from the United Kingdom to Swit-aerland until the federal Government can show that the jute bags in which Swiss cement is exported to Germany are duly returnsd to Switzerland.jlgjSj) SffjffSS.    Bner^stio measures have been taken to provide cars for the transport of grain to the Western seaboard.   Consignments intended for the Allies will be given priority,   i&apos;he United States Government hope that they will be able to ship, during February and March, the quantities of grain ?/hich they promised, at the recent Conference, that they would supply to the Allies in those months.fl5he requirements of pig iron for war industries have proved to be so heavy that vary little will be available for ordinary
