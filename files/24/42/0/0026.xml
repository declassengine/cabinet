FAIRHOLMEon theGREEK ARMY.(Despatch No. 1.)Athens,20th January, 1918.1. The 15 divisions, of which the Greek Army at this moment nominally consists, may be divided into the following categories : (a.) The three divisions of the National Defence Army Corps actually mobilised and on the Salonika Front, though still incomplete in artillery, &amp;c., and deficient of a portion of their artillery and materiel which has long been overdue from France and England, viz. :-Cretan Division (less one infantry regiment). Archipelago Division. Serres Division.(6.) Troops already in the Salonika war zone, but still under instruction prior to taking their places in front line, viz. :  1st Division.One infantry regiment.The division was made up to war strength, without a mobilisation, by drawing on the 1915, 1916 and 1917 contingents of other divisions.The infantry regiment was recently formed to replace the 9th Regiment of the Cretan Division which has been kept in Old Greece for political reasons.(c.) Divisions of the Old Army normally stationed in Old Greece and still under more or less normal peace conditions.   These are : 2nd 13th 3rd 4th 14th 8th 9thDivision Division Division Division Division Division DivisionAthens.Chalcis.Patras.Nauplia.Kalamata.Corfu.J anina.(d) Divisions of the Old Army displaced owing to recent events, and now reduced to mere skeleton divisions : The three divisions of the Illrd Army Corps from Macedonia (10th, 11th and 12th).The 16th Division from Southern Albania, the remains of which are at Pyrgos.(e.) Permanently at Athens for political reasons : The 9th Infantry Regiment of the Cretan Division at war strength.2. The strength of a mobilised division, under the recent scheme introduced, by the French Military Mission, was given in the enclosures to my despatch No. 10 of 5th October, 191.7.** 397 officers, 17,188 other ranks, 6,415 animals, 344 vehicles. -(B18/131)  30  2/18  h&amp;S -5563wo
The strength of the immobilised divisions varies according to localities, but the present collective strength of the divisions coming under the categories (c) and (d) may be taken roughly at about 42,000 men, made up as follows: 1915 contingent still with colours ...       ...       ...       ...     15,0001916 and 1917 contingents ....       ...       .........     45,00060,000Less 18,000 taken to form the 1st Division and the newregiment mentioned under (b)    ...      ...      ...      ...     18,000Leaves ...      ...      ...      ...      ...     42,0003. Thus ib will be seen that no actual mobilisation has as yet taken place in Old Greece, except for the calling to the colours of a few classss of previously exempted men and special categories which amount to a negligible figure.After undergoing various changes and modifications the mobilisation scheme at this moment stands as follows : On the 14th February, the 1911, 1912 A and B, 1913 and 1914 classes of reservists are to be . called up in the areas of the 13th Division (Cbalcis) and 9th Division (Janina).The movement of the completed 13th Division to the Salonika zone is not to commence before the 15th March, the earliest date on which General Guillaumat will be able to spare the necessary railway transport.From that date forward the following four divisions are to be mobilized successively in the same manner and transported to the Salonika zone at a rate which is governed by the capabilities of the available railway transport, viz. : 2nd Division (Athens), 3rd Division (Patras), 4th Division (Nauplia), and 14th Division (Kalamata).It is hoped that the mobilisation of the six divisions of the Old Army will be com-pleted by 1st May, and their movement to Salonika a fortnight later.On arrival in the war zone the divisions will require at least from four to six weeks&apos; training before they can be fit for employment at the front, so that it is clear that no serious help can be counted on from the Greek Army before the end of June at the very earliest, and that only if the promised equipment, &amp;c, arrives from France and England up to time.The 9th Division is being mobilised for service in Epirus or in Southern Albania if required, in case the enemy develops greater activity on that portion of the front. It is being provided with equipment, &amp;c, without drawing on the Allies, by making use of existing materiel from the Army reserves.What has lately been stopping the whole progress of mobilisation is undoubtedly the lack of rolling stock. It should be remembered that a great portion of the rolling stock of the Greek railways has long been detained by our Salonika Armies, and that what remains is barely sufficient for the most pressing needs of the country as regards provisioning the population, &amp;c.Thus at the present moment movements of troops can only be carried out with rolling stock furnished ad hoc from Salonika and none will be available for this purpose beiore the 15th March.I understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government had promised to send 300 trucks and 10 engines to Greece and if these had been available matters would have progressed more rapidly; if they were despatched even now it should make a great difference. Coal is also urgently required, 6,000 tons being necessary for the movement by rail of one division.   Thus 30,000 tons are urgently required for this purpose.Of course, if any shipping could be furnished (with the necessary coal) it would help matters considerably.4. I gather from the heads of the French Military Mission that the Greek Govern-ment now fully realises that their first idea, that of an imposing Greek Army appearing all at once on the Salonika Front is unrealisable, and that Monsieur Venizelos himself is now doing all he can to further the less ambitious scheme drawn up by the French Mission.It is however to be feared that a very bad effect will be produced throughout Greece if it should at any time appear that the Greek units are to be employed on the
Salonika Front simply to enable Allied troops to be withdrawn for service elsewhere and any reduction of the British and French contingents there would be regarded with dismay.5. As regards the quality of the new Greek Army it will. be wise not to count on it too much and certainly not to calculate on Greek units being anything like an equivalent for British and French ones.Although, the French Mission is doing all that is possible for the instruction, discipline and sense of duty are lamentably deficient, and unless very severe measures are adopted and examples made, it is to be anticipated that the Greek Army, once mobilised, will melt away, especially if things were to go wrong.The 1st Division which arrived in the Salonika zone five weeks ago 15,000 strong and is still under instruction before going up to the front, has already lost 6,000 men through desertions, &amp;c.The present General Staff is very incompetent and inexperienced, all the best officers having had to be removed as inveterate Constantinists, and it is to be feared that the same state of things prevails in the regiments.(Sd.)
