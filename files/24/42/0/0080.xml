FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 20th February, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work cf the Department ? the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland?:-

TILLAGE DEFAULTERS.

The work of inspecting holdings, the occupiers of which were in ? default in respect of the cultivation of their holdings under ? 1917 Tillage Regulations, is proceeding as indicated in last Week&apos;s report. In many cases it has been found that the requisite area has been ploughed up or set in conacre for a 1918 crop. In some instances, however the Inspectors have reported that little or no effort has been made by occupiers to have the necessary ploughing carried out on their ?dings, and the question as to whether the Department should exercise ? powers of having portions of these holdings placed under cultivation has been receiving attention.

In last week&apos;s report it was mentioned that seven holdings were ? possession of by the Department and lettings in conacre announced during the week the Department&apos;a Inspectors have taken or have been instructed to take possession of sixteen additional holdings. Auction? conacre lettings in those cases have been or will be announced and  ? to be hold within the next few days. In two cases where the department decided to let land in conacre, the Inspectors, when about ? take possession, found that the occupiers themselves had, within ? last few days set in conacre an acreage approximately equal to the ? required under the 1918 Tillage Order.

It was reported last week that the Department had entered and taken possession of a large holding in the West of Ireland. The public ? in this case began on Monday last, and is still in progress, and already? 250 acres have been set in conacre by the Department&apos;s Inspector ? another large farm in South Tipperary on which the Department entered ? acres were let in conacre by public auction.

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Ninty-seven applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year to date, under the scheme, amounts to  Â£12,156.
