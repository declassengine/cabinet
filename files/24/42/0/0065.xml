(This Document 18 the Property^     228HOUSING 0? TS^oSScTGLASsis&quot;AFTER THE WAR. sorstaryMHpiORAHDUH BY THE SECRET ARY FOR SCOTLAND.I concur generally in the view of my colleague, the President of the Local Government Board, as to the I ^% importance of pressing forward without delay the prepara-yNcp\\tion of schemes for the provision of houses for the work-taS.-)g)ling classes at the end of the War.   The Report of theRoyal Commission on Housing in Scotland,     -   the issue of w/ which last year gave a great impetus to the discussion of \\*a/   the question,  -   &apos;  showed that the urgency of the Scottish problem is at least equal to that of the English problem.ot/rfate, Foreign Affair^hFollowing upon the decision of the War Cabinet on 24th July, 1917, a circular similar to that issued in England and &quot;$Tales was issued by my direction to Local Authorities in Scotland by the Scottish Local Government Board.   The returns received from 297 out of 311 Local Authorities show a need for approximately 110,000 houses, and^a^Tsillingnssq on the part of these Authorities to erect/99,000 houses, provided satisfactory financial assist-ance is received from the Exchequer.I have been in frequent conference with the President of the Local Government Board and my other Ministerial Colleagues    interested in the subject as to the basis on which financial assistance should be given towards housing schemes in view of the exceptional conditions aris-ing out of the War.   I have also had an opportunity of con-sidering the proposals of the President of the Local Govern-ment Board in process of their adjustment with the Treasury. While these proposals differ from the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Housing in Scotland in respect that under them a proportion of the&apos; estimated annual deficit in connection with housing schemes will fall to be met by the Local Authorities, the proportion., suggested,-viz:    one-fourth of the deficit, which in no case is to exceed the equivalent of a rate of one penny per   in the district of the Local Authority - seems to me in the circumstances reasonable.   Such an arrangement, coniucive as it -will be to economy in carrying out housing schemes, appears to &quot;be conceived on sound lines.I am in general agreement with the views expressed ^oy the President of the Local Government Board as to the difficulty of adopting the schema put forward by the Ministry of Reconstruction.   It appears to me that the responsibilities, financial and administrative, which it would place directly upon the State at a time when its bur-dens will in &amp;1X probability be unprecedentedly heavy would prove to be of a very grave character.I accordingly support the proposal for immediate action, as recommended by the President of the Local Govern-, ment Board.   I suggest that a circular on the same lines as he asks authority to issue in England and Wales should be issued to Local Authorities in Scotland with the lea-st possible delay.(SIGHED) ROBERT I.7JER0.Scottish Office,19th February, 1913.
