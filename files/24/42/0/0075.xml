j this Document is he Property -.-t fk4mll &apos;%ttffl   J H*s Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)f REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE ACT - Qualifying Period.emorandum by the President of the Local Government Board.1It is necessary to determine- immediately the date to be fixed as the &quot;qualifying period&quot; for the first Register under the Act, -inasmuch as the age of a person for purposes of registration depends upon the qualifying period, and the forms of statement upon-whioh the -electoral qualifications, including the age, of Naval and Military voters are to bo furnished must be dispatched to the Troops, the Fleet,  etc. at the very -earliest moment if they are to serve for the new Register.After consultation with representatives of the Registration Officers, who will have to prepare the Registers, I propose that the qualifying period for the first Register should be April next.the 6 months ending on the 15thI have at the same time considered what should be the other registration dates for tho first Register.Under normal conditions the Overseers bogin their work of preparing the lists about the middle of April, the Registor comes into force for Municipal elections on the 1st November and for Parliamentary elections.and other Local Government elections on tho 1st January.      The actual work from the beginning of the compilation of the lists to the printing of the registers now takes just six months. Under present abnormal conditions it seems necessary to allow rather more than six months.     It must be remembered that the present register is practically of no use as a basis for revision;    and completely new manuscript lists must be prepared for the printer.     The new franchise, too, will necessitate, especially for the first register, much more careful and exhaustive inquiries in connexion with the qualifications of electors as &quot;residents&quot; and as &quot;naval and military voters&quot;.      The view that at least six or even seven months will be required if a reasonably good register is to be obtained his beon pressed upon my Department by a number of Clerks of the Peace and Town Clerks who will be responsible for the work.I accordingly propose that the register should be published and oome into force on the 1st October, and that the intermediate dates for the several procedures connected with the first Registration should be as shown in the following table:-Registration Dates.Subject-matter.Proposed date&apos;End of Qualifying periodPublication of lists.......Objections to electors listsClaims...................t.Claims as absent voters&apos;....15th April 15th June 29th June 5th July 5th JulyP.T.O.
