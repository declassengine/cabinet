Colonel Jones74Note by D.M.I. on Sir I^Rumbold1 s No.1304 of 28th December 1917, in accordance with decision of War Cabinet Meeting 308.st.The importance of .Berne telegram 1304 depends largely upon the degree of reliability that can be attached to M.Shipkoff. Thia gentleman, as far as is known, occupies no official position in Bulgaria, he is believed, however, to be in olose relations with King Ferdinand and may perhaps be considered as the confidential agent of -the latter and -of the Bulgarian Government,It seems possible however, that in the main his first three statements are correct.     There is ltttle doubt that Bulgaria is tired of the war, anxious for peace and that she would be most unwilling to send any troops either to Italy to assist the Austriane or to Asia to assist the Turks,     As regards her action on the Macedonian front, if she is left to herself she is unlikely to make any serious attack on General Guillaumat&apos;a Army, except perhaps for the purpose of regain$flg Monastir, but there is always the possibility that German divisions may &quot;be sent to that front and may oompel the Bulgars to assist them in an offensive against Salonika.Information received from various sources indicates that . the Bulgarians resent German domination and are unwilling to be converted into a semi-dependent state forming part of a highway &quot;between Germany and the East.     They seem to be much displeased with Count Hertling*s recent declaration that Germany will leave the settlement of Balkan problems to Austria, they dread an occupation of Salonika by the latter Power, and probably desire to become the predominant partner in a Balkan confederacy, blocking the expansion if Germany eastwards, and seeking to develop, their own oountry, and possibly part of Turkey as well, with the assistance of American money.There is much sympathy &quot;between Bulgaria and the U.S*A. They are still at peaoe and maintain their diplomatic representatives in Sofia and Washington respectively, and it is probable, as Sir H.R.umbold states, that the Bulgarians were much disturbed by the American declaration of war against Austria and are most anxious to avoid a similar declaration against themselves.If any steps are to be taken to detach Bulgaria from the Central Empires,., it is essential that they should be taken by America. It seems improbable that a definite severance oould be arranged, but there is a possibility that some secret understanding might be reached, whereby Bulgaria would agree to preserve a passive attitude. Bulgariajrould almost certainly have to be guaranteed Macedonia, but she might agree to evacuate the occupied portions of Old Serbia in consideration of receiving compensation elsewhere, preferably in the Adrianople district.It is needless to say that in any negotiations with King Ferdinand the utmost caution will have to be observed.     There is a possibility that he might take advantage of any conversations that might be instituted to sow discord between the Allies, but- provided this danger is recognized there seems no reason why, as suggested in the last paragraph of Berne 1304, we should not favour an exchange of views between the Americans axld Bulgarians with a view to the latter coming out of the war.General Staff, War Office,14th February. 1918.(Sd)    G.M.W.MACD0K0GH.D.M.I.
