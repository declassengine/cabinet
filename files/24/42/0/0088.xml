The Board further consider that, in the newly formed District Wages Committees under the Corn Production Act, the medium for effecting auoh agreements in moat parts cf the country is ready to hand, and, as the Aot contemplates these Committees doing other than their statutory duties, the Board have asked them to hold meetings with   , a vievr to fixing the actual market rates in each District.   The Board have suggested that this work should be undertaken unofficially and they have impressed upon Committees that it must be carefully -distinguished from their statutory duties of fixing minimum rates under the Corn Production Aot.The Board have circularised the Secretaries of District Wages: Committees (Kos. 2-11 inclusive), the Highland and Agricultural Society, Scottish Chamber of Agriculture, National Farmers&apos; Union, Scottish Farm Servants&apos; Union, and the Secretaries of District Agricultural Executive Committees on this subject.COLLBCTIQK of STATISTICS and RFTUItffS relating to ^GBICUXTURB.
