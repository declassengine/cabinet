g t,nCT!MP.Nff 13 THE PROPERTY OF.HIS BIKTAPTTIC 3 AJE3TY*3 GOm^^llh.C R E T, ,T. 3681.WAR CABINET. R3C0H3TRUCTI0N FINANCE. MEMORANDUM 3V THE FIRST COHMISSIO^liR OF WORKS. (Previous Paper G.T. 3643).ofThe important Memorandum - by the Minister of Reconstruction the 10th of February,  (G.T. 3643) raises such important questions of policy for future development that I venture shortly to express my views thereon to the War Cabinet.Without going into detail as to tie urgent matters to beectthe provision of sufficiei raw materialto be imported after the War as rapidly as possible. This would seem to be a first priority, in order to get the Country going.taken in hand,  there is one omission to which I would attention,  and that is the question port facilities on a large scale to enable foodI understand that an important scheme is being prep;by aneminent authority on the subject, namely, Sir Norman Helme.Generally speaking, I wish to express my concurrence with the views of the Minister of Reconstruction, but it would appear useless to devote a large amount of time, work and. energy to working out schemes of reconstruction unless the finances necessary for their execution can be assured.    The fact is that to raise expectations among the people of great improvements in social conditions which could not be fulfilled would, in my opinion be extremely dangerous ana playing direct into the hands of violent extremists who wish to destroy our existing social -structure.The repayment of debt, while lightening the burden of taxation will not,  in itself,  in any way^promote better social conditions and the argument could easily/advanced that effort wa3 being directed to remove the burdens from the shoulders of the wealthy instead of dealing with the necessity of the poor. This refers especially to the debt hole, in this country.   The question of debt incurred in foreign countries involves problems of exchange which will require different consideration.The views expressed in 8 appear tc be unanswerable.the Memorandum paragraphs 6,  7 and The enormous sums spent on warsome extent unfortunately, it is possible to spend very, and although argument that we should not a large way when we haveexpenditure have undoubtedly, and to given to the public the feeling that large sums while national prosperity is maintained this is economically fallacious, the refuse to spend on peace purposes in spent great sums on war purposes, however illogical, will be very powerful.   It must be remembered that the objects in view, differing in this from war expenditure,  will be in the nature of productive, capital and that State Finance will be merely applying national credit instead of private credit to schemes which, if properly carried out,  should, return reasonable interest on the money spent.   The National forms of account in the past have not been so devised as to show the capital account and in this re-spect are undoubtedly misleading.   They give an impression that money devoted by the State for purposes which arc of a capital
character 13 spent annually without return in the same manner as , Votes, whose expenditure is an annual charge.   It is obvious tha.1 if in future the State is to be a participant on a considerable scale in social or industrial enterprises some other form of accounting must be devised.(Sgd.)    ALFRED MOND.H.JI.
