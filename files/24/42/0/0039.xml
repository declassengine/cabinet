/This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic fVlajesty&apos;s Government.)9THE   LABOUR   SITUATION ONTHE CLYDE INRELATION TO-THE &quot;SEDUCED OUT-PUTp .OFMERCHANT   TONNAGE.MEMORANDUM  FROM   TEE   MINISTER   OF   1AB0UR.15 - Z - 1918i
The -First Lord has recently submitted to the War Cabinet a / very grave Statement oh tke output of Merchant tonnage during themonth of January 1918; followed by a recommendation for publicity -f-in respect of our tonnage losses, in order that the seriousness oftho position may be brought home to the Workers.The diminution of output in January, particularly on the Clyde is attributed to abnormally bad weather, an unpardonable extension of the Hew Year Holidays, strikes and a general inclination to go slow.The Clyde is perhaps the most important district engaged on the production of Standard ships and other vital chips, and it is essential to asoertain whether the causes for decreased output oan be palliated or removed.The weather is obviously not subject to control;   the horsing conditions which are a slow-moving but obstinate cause of discon-tent have been scandalous but it is understood that tho Admiralty have taken the problem seriously in hand.The food situation is probably bad, but it is undoubtedly being exploited, and the chances of exploitation will decrease with each increase of a compulsory rationing system.   Such a system may not involve more food, hut it implies a Specious   equality of burden.Pacifism is noisy but it is eloar from recent reports that extreme views are by no means universal.The causes of unrest above are largely psychological and it is doubtful whether under present fatigue muoh can be done by any administrative machinery to remove them.There are, however, three concrete industrial causes of trouble whioh the Ministry of Labour ie inclined to consider the most important, and those can be met:-(1)   The first is tho unrest caused by the 12^$ order.   Undoubtedly while the position of pieceworkers v/as still undefined no regular work could reasonably be expected as the bonus   implied no need for ier,effort but on Monday 4th February, after hearing the case, the Committee on Production issued their Award of i\\o bonus to pieco workers among   the Shipwrights and Boilermakers.   On the whole tho decision has been received contentedly by those two Societies: the A.S.E. had already received tho benefit of 12-1-   for their time workers, and though their premium bonus men in the Marine Engineer-ing Shops may claim 12$j  on the ground that they are time workers, they will probably accept the decision that premium benus workers shall get 7-J?o on earnings as do pieoeworkero.   The boilarmakers returned to work directly it became, ole&amp;r that they would get the bonus.It is probable therefore that on the Clyde as a whole the disturbance caused by the order will die down speedily;   any serious traces left by it will take the form of a transfer from piece-work to time-work, with perhaps a consequent diminution of output.   In the present state of morale; on the Clyde the impression that the bonus appeared to be granted without reference to effort is the potential source of trouble.(11). Rivetters List.The Second trouble which at the moment is causing a strike on the lower reaches of the river and is understood to have been the reason for the big strike over tho Hew Year is the position of the Hivetters List, which affects the Boilermakers1 Society,/ numbering
numbering more than 50$ of the total men on the Clyde engaged in work on ships.The list of prices for work which has been in existence for several years has not been modernised to meet changed conditions in shipbuilding and immediately previous to the War a wholesale revision and standardisation was in contemplation and oven in progress.   Already the uniformity of the list had gone as individual employers occasionally made up the pay sheets with liou rates, special allowances etc., but when the war came with demands for/ships -entirely now kind, the variations rapidly multiplied.Tho trouble may be said to have begun with the first Admiralty ordor early in 1915 for a special typo of single screw Minesweeper. The idea was experimental and orders were confined at first to very fow firms;   the work was very urgent, and difficult owing to the narrow lines of the ships and the firm chiefly conoerned bo-gan to pay lieu ratos and all manner ofmake-up1 allowances. As the order spread, so did the allowance.   Then case further complications with the paddle steamers and twin screw minesweepers and finally standard ships,   each olass of ship obtaining a new rate of pay varying with the firm who had the contracts.It is impossible not to form the opinion that serious looseneus in the control of contracts oxisted;   however much the firms may have broken away from their Federation rules as to rates, the variations suggest loose estimates of the proper costs and a loose control over the actual work done, e,g. the men state that often they were credited and paid for rivetc never driven, similar practices were openly alleged bofore the Committee on Production, it being also stated that the names of the firms were torn off the paysheets before the sheets were handed out,Although thoy havo little evidence bofore them other than loose statements, and influences from unexplained facts, the Ministry of Labour believe that there is something radically wrong with the Employers on the Clyde as well as with the men. It is perhaps not just on the facts before them to suggest corruption or malpractice on the part of foremen responsible for the giving out of the work, but the whole atmosphere of the Clyde denotes a moral rot, and such an atmosphere oannot ordinarily arise where relations between employers and men aro-&apos; honourable even though they are not harmonious.There is a tendency on both sides to conceal facts and tt burk impartial enquiry;   if this is due to any form of collusion implicit or tolerated, at the expense of the State, the explanation of tho unsatisfactory situation is found.   It ic also duo ho doubt to manoeuvre tactics as both sides are well organised.   Both sides are ready to profess patriotism upon oooasion, but it is especially on the Clyde that the Ministry of Labour has found on both sides a completo look of that accommodating spirit which should characterise the parties to such a vital national industry.It is obvious from the above that the Rivetters List in tho sense of an accepted and orderly list had ceased to exist,&apos; it the same time the employers were anxious to get back to the lists, as tho conditions were intolerable.Attempts were made on su/r-estion of Committee on Production to draw up a revised list, item by item, under neutral chairman-ship but after discussions lasting for many days agreement had only boen reached as such a small number of it-ems that prolonga-tion of the discussion was futile, and resort was had to arbitration./ There
There are three findings applicable.(a) Single arbitrator who decided in May 1917 that tho rate for trawlers should bo on the Clyde merchant list of rivetters prices.(b) Arbitration Court under Mr. Condie Sandeman-ln May 1917 in the- case of Standard ships, added 35% to tho Merchant ships plus 2fyp for holders-oh.   The men objected to this award, and it was probably disregarded by both Aides,(a) Interim Award oh Standard Ships by Mr, StokerlS tribunal in July 1917 of 60^ plus fef on tho list pii-oe rates, wi^h special allowances for obstructions etc,, and on the under-s^andihg that an attempt would bo made to codify and amend the list,An enquiry was arranged by Ministry of Labour into the rates after the award but although both sides agreed, the Boilermakers1 Society acted in. bad faith, raising all sorts of tochhio&amp;l obstructions and the enquiry was- novar carried out,The Committee on Production, after a long hearing embittered by the appearance as a witness for tho employors of an ex-ofiieiai of the Boilermakers-&apos; Society who had boon active while with the Society, in working out the proposed . now List, issued awards on 11th December fixing the rates for all work at 60$ over Clyde List rates plus        for holders-on.;This award reaffirmed Mr, Stokers&apos; of July and purported to give the men 17-g$ increase over tho 4S-J^ awarded by Mr, Condio Sandeman,Tho men were dissatisfied, struck and have now offered to go back on the old, rates (apparently tho actual rates paid without any reference to Lists or the awards) ponding an ojaquijpjf.   The Ministry of Labour realise that tho men&apos;&apos;&quot;&quot;&quot; must fo back not on the old ratos but on the rates as fixed by Committee on Production but this attitude of the men reveals real trouble.   They have rejected 42- $ and 60$ over list prides as moaning a wholesale reduction on earnings. If their contention is right,$he departures from tho List rates mudt have-vbeon so great as to make the List a pious fiction, not worth fighting for.   Tho -facts are very obscure, apd Ministry of Labour&quot; oonsider it essential to prove th*s mattei4.ThoBmplovers&apos; Federation are now disciplining their ranks, are working reasonably strictly to tho Committee on Production award and are accused by tho men of interpreting the award in some particulars in a narroi? spirit.It is too lato now to adopt this attitude-   and this form of death-bod repentance angers tho men.   If the rates previously paid with the addition of make, up allowances etc,, were- higher than the Committee on Production award, it is obvious that tho Committee on Production award must bo reconsidered; an award on arbitration which results in a wido reduction of rates cannot bo supported,   if its consequences are desperate to a national work like Ship-building.Moreover it is believed that the men are not entirely standing out for higher pay, but for some stability of pay as between yards, some system which oan bo understood,3. /If
If the trouble on the Clyde continues, it may have grave resultsof which the Country must be made aware. Tho Ministry of Labour oaanot accept the responsibility before the Country unless they are in possession of the facts.The men have asked for an enquiry:   the executive have beea asked if they.support this request.   If they do, the Ministry of Labour considersi$  a strong impartial Commission of Enquiry should be appointed-to examine into the facts. There may be reluctance to give the facts, and it may there-fore be advisable for the Contracting Department i.e, the Admiralty to conduct the enquiry by moans of a very strict audit.     On the other hand it may be necessary to take evidenoo and if so obviously some one of judicial and teehni-oal knowledge will be required to assist.(Ill) Beardmores. 4.,-The third cause of unrest 0$&apos; the Clyde seems to be Beardmores,   Prom the evidence before the Chief Indie trial Commissioner^ Department it is clear that bad relations exisl; between the management of this firm and its employees. The dangerous faot in this not uncommon position is that Gallaohe, McManus and one or two more of tho mjist powerful extremists are employed at Beardmores in various works. ThSB they have $fc^wiil and power to exploit any trouble with their firm oah&apos;rbe &quot;Shown by the serious consequences which were threatened by the alleged victimisation of four women workers at the East Hope Street, where a national stoppage was suggested.It is not really out of proportion to give this prominence to Beardmores.   They employ large numbers of the turbulent part of the A.S.E., and in the present temper of that body, bitter over the comb out and wearied by really remarkable efforts over a long period, handling of labour by Messrs. Beardmore may easily  rove to be the spark that lights a big fire.It seems probable that Sir William Beardmore is not unaware of the situation, and is. not too eager to help, but in the present crisis, the pride of one big employer should bo put into its proper place.   The Ministry of Labour believe that the personal intervention of the highest authority may be necessary, but here again as in the whole situation&quot; fim tho Clyde, they consider that a very firm and impartial handling of both sides may produce    remarkable results.Tho temper of the Clyde has changed in the last three weeks;   it is now better than it has beon for some time, and a sincere and immediate effort to use this improvement to advantage by examining the chief causes of   discontent might result in a permanent improvement.13.2.
