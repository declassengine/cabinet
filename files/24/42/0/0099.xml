A p     &apos; -I    . d 16 fThis Document is t^e Property of &quot;Hte Britannic Majesty^ Govern menffifch February. 191**BY THE ROYAL COMMISSION Off SUPPLIESI^HALLPROPOSED FURTHER PURCHASE OP V&quot;EEA&apos;i? IH AUSTRALIA      / -The Australian Harvest operations commence in Noyemher-and are completed in January and February, and the Australian Government have   for some time past, suggested that nego-tiations should be entered into for the purchase of the exportable surplus of the Harvest just gathered.      The position is that Great Britain, France and Italy own about 2-^. million tons of Wheat still remaining in Australia of the I previous harvests, and a further 1 million tons, of the Harvest of Christmas 1916 is owned by the Commonwealth Government.     The surplus of the Harvest of Christmas, 1917, is estimated to amount to about 2 million tons.     There is, therefore, at the present time, between 5 and 6 million tons of wheat in Australia available for export, about half of which belongs to Great Britain, France and Italy, and the remainder to the Commonwealth Government.    &quot;The Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies ask for authority to negotiate for the purchase of this balance of wheat - From unofficial communications, they have reason to believe that the French and Italian Governments would be prepared to partici-pate in the purchase, if it is authorised.The Royal Commission are aware that the Treasury do not favour the proposed purchase on general grounds, and par-ticularly because the previous purchases have been subjected to adverse criticism by a Select Committee of the House of Commons .     The Royal Commission appreciate the view that, when regarded purely from the stand-point of providing finance, the scheme may be open to objection, but in their opinion, the advantages of such an operation should be held to outweigh any possible objection from this point of view.(a)   Wheat bought under the existing contract, can only be shipped to Great Britain, France and Italy.     The *us trailan Government are anxious sellers, to other destinations
of the wheat they hold, and are, consequently, in active competition for ocean tonnage.(h)   The cereals available in the exporting markets situated nearer to Europe are definitely insufficient to meet the total needs of the Allies.     It is therefore, desirable to direct to Aus-tralia any new demands for cereals for the supply of iteutral Nations, The difficulty of effecting this would be lessened if it were possi-ble to offer fco provide wheat cargoes at a definite price.     Under the present arrangements, it would be necessary for each Neutral country to enter into separate negotiations with the Australian Government,(o)   The present arrangements tend to lead to a waste, both of foodstuffs and of tonnage.      rith two owners of the wheat in Australia, it is not possible with any completeness, to secure that the wheat, which will not keep, is first consumed.     If all the wheat were in one hand, the Koyal Commission are advised that com-paratively little waste would be incurred, unless it should remain impossible to export the wheat over a period of several years.Further, it could, and should, be made a condition of any further purchases, that the Ministry of Shipping should have the sole direction of all shipping engaged in wheat transport from Australia, and, further, that all ships at present under the control of the Australian Government suitable for wheat transport, should be transferred to the control of the Ministry of Shipping.(d)   The Commonwealth Government have guaranteed to purchase the present crop from their farmers at a price equivalent to 32/-f.o.b.     This payment is now falling due, and past experience leads to the conclusion that the Commonwealth Government are likely to exert continually increasing pressure until some financial assistance has been received to enable them to meet this payment.(8)   If Uie impression is given that the unexpected balance of wheat will be left as a loss on the hands of the Commonwealth Government,     It is certain that the tendency to decrease the future production of wheat in Australia would be enhanced.     Having
regard to the improbability of obtaining- wheat supplies in the future from Russia or Rouma&amp;ia, to the fact that the countries from which supplies are now available do not provide sufficient to meet the needs of the Allies, and to the doubt as to the future   European supply, the ^iOyal Commission would strongiy deprecate any course y/hich will decrease production in Australia.ff)   The strongest argument for immediate purchase of the remaining wheat in Australia is that the existence of such a large block of wheat not definitely under the joint control of the Allies, might be the cause of tho gravest possible embarrassment either during, or immediater after, any peace negotiations which may be entered into. 8. How that free purchases can be made in South America, it maybe said that, with the exception of this block of wheat in Australia, the Allies and America jointly control, either actually or potentially, the entire cereal supplies of the world available for   export, andthe Royal Commission venture to suggest that the positions would be enormously strengthened if the remaining wheat in Australia was alsojointly controlled.The cost involved cannot be accurately determined until after negotiations, but it should not exceed  27,000,000 in all, of which, it may be assumed, one half would fall to be borne by Great Britian* Some part of this cost would at once be saved by the advantage of con-tr-ol of the shipments and marketing of grain, and some part of the cost would be recouped by the control of shipping, and, quite apart from this if oeace should ensue while the grain remains fit for shipment, it is reasonable to suppose that the venture would immediately assume an attractive commercial aspect.
