Hit Britannicl^ajesty^rGo^^i^y No&apos;    19 79/London/88, 22,2.18.MEMORANDUM ON AIR REQUIREMENTS POR THE DEFENCE OF LONDON .The attached report dated 17th January, 1918, of the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chieff Home Forces, on the air defence of London is forwarded in accordance with the instructions of the War Cabinet as recorded in the proceedings of the 320th meeting held on January 11th,, 1918,On receipt of this report a consultation took place between the General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff and other authorities with regard to the scale of an enemy air attack, and their conclusion was that a maximum total of 118 machines might be made available, and that they might all be employed simul-taneously.     Of these it is unlikely that more than 80 machines would actually reach these shores.     The Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces ^ was informed of this conclusion on January 30th, and was asked whether his existing or contemplated air defences were sufficient to deal with a raid on this scale and if not, whether any additional defences would ensure the failure of the attack, and of what nature these defences should be.In reply the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces,stated that his total requirements would be the following(i)     300   120 cm, searchlights additional to the replacements now in progress,(2)     A total of 12 squadrons with 20 machines each, and 4 additional flights for wireless work (24 maohines), 264 machines in all,(3)     100 additional guns of larger calibre than 3&quot;,The- situation -with regard to the above requirements is asfollows(1)     Searchlights - The provision of the 300 sets now asked for cannot under present conditions commence until October next.
/i      38 are required to replace 13 pr. 6 cwt.(2)    Aeroplanes - 8 service squadrons (160 machines) formed^ and 2 service squadrons (40 machines) forming, to be ready by Kay.(3)     Guns over calibre of 3&quot; - One 4&quot; gun.   It is -anticipated that 9 more of these guns will be delivered by June, and there is no prospect of obtaining the 100 guns asked for by the Field iilarshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces, for a long time.3. In connection with this question of the provision ofair defence, it should be noted that the Field MarshalCommanding-in-Chief, British Armies in France, has recently -pressed for additional guns for the air defences of theaerodrome of Nancy, consisting of20    3&quot; 20 cwt. guns.12   13 pr.      9 cwt, guns. 12  Anti-aircraft searchlight sections.These demands which are in addition to his otherrequirements for the Western Front can only be made good.atthe expense of Home Defence.The situation as regards the above types of guns is asfollowsRequired Required Required for Anticipatedfor                   for                 Home           Total.

As regards aeroplanes,the additional squadrons askedfor for the defence of London can only be -obtained at the expense of France.     If Hone Defence is to have precedence of France the squadrons could be provided by May; the effect would be to cause a delay of two months in meeting the requirements of France.     If France is to continue to have precedence then the additional squadrons would probably not be available for Home Defence before October.
General Staff, War Office.22nd February, 1918.(Sd.)   Henry Wilson.C.I.G.S,The questions for decision by the War Cabinet are Is Home Defence to have precedence over Prance (i)   in guns (ii)   in aeroplanes.My recommendations are that in view of the great importance of maintaining the moral of the Capital of the Empire, Home Defence should be given for the present precedence over Prance as regards Anti-aircraft guns. This will mean that we shall be able to supply the 13-pr. 9 cwt guns for the Hancy aerodrome but not the 3&quot; 20 cwt. guns.As regards aeroplanes, in view of the great importance of superiority In the air in the battle which may take place before long on the Western front, of the fact that more aeroplanes are urgently needed In Prance, and that two additional squadrons are now in process of formation for Home Defence, I recommend that Prance should continue to have precedence over Home Defence as regards aeroplanes.
H.F.C.R. 13788. (A.A.) s 2 C H J3 TIMPORT OH THU AIR DEFDNC1DS Off LOHDOflThe present scheme for the Air Defences of London, which is Hearing completion, has been built up&apos; by successive stages to meet the different forms of air attack to which London has been subjected since the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces, assumed responsibility in April 1916 for the defence of the United Kingdom against attack by air.These forms of attack are(1)   Attack by Zeppelins.(2)   Attack by aeroplanes by day.(3)   Attack by aeroplanes by night.2* Defence against attack by Zeppelins.(1)     The power of navigation and the rayon of action of Zeppelins render London liable to this form of attack from any direction.     The defence of London was therefore necessarily an all round defence, and guns were disposed at single gun stations at supporting intervals over an area including London itself and as large a zone around it as the number of guns available permitted, so that an attacking airship would be illuminated f\nd under fire for a considerable time before reaching its objective, as well as while over the objective, should he reach it.(2)     Under the original scheme 83 guns were, to have been disposed in this manner for the defence Of London proper, but owing to the decision of the Cabinet in January 1917 to divert to the Admiralty 190 of the 403 fixed guns earmarked for Home defence, the London scheme was cut down to 64 guns.(3)     Outside the gun perimeter advanced lights were disposed for the purpose of illuminating the enemy before he came within range of the guns, so as to enable our aeroplanes to see him and attack, and guns to open fire the moment the enemy came within range.(4) The small-number of aeroplanes available for Home Defence enabled only one squadron R.F.C. to -be allotted for the immediate/protection
protection of London, and the three flights of this squadron were disposed at three separate aerodromes covering London, from the North and North East, this being the most probable line of attack.The fact that Zeppelins did not attack in groups   or even pairs and the vulnerability of a Zeppelin to attack by a single aeroplane permitted this dispersion of force.(5)     Indirect protection was afforded to London, as to the whole of England, by flights R.F.C. disposed along a searchlight barrage line which runs from Northumberland to Sussex about 25 miles inland from the coast and approximately following the contour of the lattere(6)     Delays in the provision of guns did not permit the com-pletion of the London gun scheme until July 1917, but long before that time, i.e. October 1916, the losses incurred by the enemy in attempting attacks on London with Zeppelins flying at about 12.000 feet high, had brought this form of attack to a close. Since then only once have the Home Counties been visited by Zeppelins..    These were of a later type capable of flying at a height of 18,000 feete     On this occasion (19th-20th October 1917) only one of the eleven Zeppelins engaged in the raid (without, knowing its whereabouts and partly out of control) passed at a very great height over the centre of the metropolis, and was with six others carried by a strong North West wind over Prance where 4 were destroyed..(7)     The Zeppelin menace aannot however be said to have dis^ appeared.     Great improvements have been made in the speed, radius of action and climbing power of the latest type of Zeppelins, while their visibility has been reduced by camouflaging the under-parts of the envelope with black dope.The return of warm weather will probably be the signal for renewed Zeppelin raids, but in view of the recent increases in the defences of London and the South East of England it is probable that they will direct their attacks on the North East/coast
coast or Midlands .3. Defence against attack by aeroplanes by day.(1)        The development of aeroplane raids since the-&amp;nrdng,-of 1917 has brought new factors into the problem of the defence of Xondon-The limited radius of action of aeroplanes confines the bases from which they can attack, to Belgium and necessitates their taking a fairly direct route to their objective.The greater speed and invulnerability to gun fire of Gothas as compared to Zeppelins, and their fighting power against attack by our aeroplanes, especially when they raid by day in large formations, necessitates concentration, both of gun fire and aeroplanes.(2)        These circumstances have caused the gun defences of the Thames &amp; Medway, Dover, Essex and Harwich, as well as the squadrons R.P.C. disposed on the searchlight barrage line in Suffolk, Essex, Kent and Sussex, to become important factors in the defence of London, and has necessitated the co-ordination of all the defences of both guns and aeroplanes, in the South-East of England.   They are now under one Command - that of the General Officer Commanding, London A.A. Defence Area.(3)        To meet the case of attack by aeroplanes in large form-ations by day a request was submitted in July 1917, for guns to form a gun barrier around the London district, about 10 miles clear of the populous portion of London, with the object of breaking up the enemy formations by gun fire, so that our aeroplanes, concen-trated between London and the barrier, could the more successfully deal with the enemy after he had passed through the barrier and had lost his formation in the passage.(4)        It was not considered justifiable to deplete to any great;!ISextent the defences of London proper, which, as has been stated,\ ihad been disposed to meet Zeppelin attack, but some 10 guns werejjwithdrawn from London, which together with 24 guns withdrawn fromthe defences in the provinces and 16 supplied by the Admiralty.*enabled a start to be made On the Eastern portion of the barrier.I I-Six 1
Six batteries of mobile guns were also withdrawn from the Horth East and Eastern counties coasts and disposed temporarily in the London gun barrier.    The defences of East Kent were strengthened by 2 mobile batterieso(5)   Further supplies of guns from the far Office have enabled a complete ring of guns to be formed around London, and the barrier now only requires 10 guns to strengthen Its Eastern portion, to complete the scheme.    This enables the 6 mobile batteries to be withdrawn from the London barrier and they are now being disposed on the Essex coast and about Canterbury.(6)   During the period of day aeroplane raids, the last of which was on Vth July 1917, no aeroplanes capable of dealing with Gothas were available.    One well equipped squadron was lent from France from 22nd June to 5th July, but during that period no raid took place.    Immediately after the last day air raid on London (7th July) 2 efficient Day Plying Squadrons were sent over from Prance and remained in this country until 30th August.     In the meantime 3 new Home Defence Day Plying Squadrons had been author-ized and were being provided with efficient day scout machines. The 5 existing squadrons in the South East of England, previously equipped only with old machines incapable of dealing even with Zeppelins of the latest type, were provided with some efficient day machines, and their respective flights concentrated at one aerodrome.    One of these squadrons was moved from Brighton to the East of London.(7)   The presence of efficient day machines in South East of England doubtless became known to the enemy, as since then no day air raids have been attempted, and the enemy soon commenced raiding by night.4. Defence against attack by aeroplanes by night.(1)   Since 4th September there have been 13 night air raids on the South East of England, 9 of which penetrated over theLondon
London district.    These have invariably taken pla*e by* moonlighW(2)   Up till the end of September 1917 there were no available night flying machines capable of dealing with Gothas.Since then it has been found practicable for a very expert pilot to fly a Sopwith Camel machine (a day scout machine) on moon-light nights.    Certain modifications are being made to render this machine safer to fly by night and pilots are being trained to its use.In addition 3 different types of efficient night flying machines have been evolved and 50 of these machines have been received.    The provision of such machines to the 8 squadrons in the South East of England is proceeding.Two additional squadrons have recently been authorized for Home Defenoe, one of which is earmarked to go to Biggin Hill aerodrome, near Croydoni    The other will be disposed at a convenient aerodrome in Essex or Kent.(3)   The principle on which guns of fixed defences were originally disposed to meet attack by Zeppelins, referred to in para. 2 (1), and the wide dispersion of the vulnerable points around London and in the Thames &amp; Medway and East Kent defences, which have to be covered by gun fire, has rendered it somewhat difficult to provide a sufficiently large zone for the operation of the large number of R.P.C. squadrons now disposed between London and the East coast,(4)   During the period of Zeppelin raids, when there was only     N&apos;J one squadron R.F.C, disposed near London, one in Essex and one in Kent, this difficulty was not experienced. &apos; IOur aeroplanes were allotted eones covered -by the range of special searchlights provided to serve them and clear of gun fire, which were of sufficient breadth to enable them to engage the slower moving Zeppelins.JIf, as occasionally happened, they pursued the enemy over areas within range of the guns they suffered comparatively little/risk !
riek of being damaged by our fire, owing to the fa-et that they could not be mistaken for the enemy airship.(5)   During the period of enemy attack by day this difficulty also seldom arose as our machines were seldom able to get in touch with the enemy Gothas, and on such occasions as they did so the standing order that guns are to suspend fire if there Is a risk of hitting our own aeroplanes, protected them.(6)   The present case of aeroplane attack by night is, however, different, as not only are there a considerable number of efficient aeroplanes to be disposed, but in firing at the sound of aircraft * which has hitherto been the main defence at night, it is not poss-ible to distinguish friend from foe.(7)   It has therefore become necessary to provide sufficiently large areas covered by searchlights clear of gun fire, to give our aeroplanes a reasonable chance of engaging the enemy without being inevitably obliged to pursue him over areas within range of the guns.   The provision of searchlights for this purpose will short-ly be completed.(8)   To increase the areas reserved for the operations of our aeroplanes, some modifications in the dispositions of fixed guns will probably be necessary.   It is at present, however, difficult to determine the ultimate relative value of guns and aeroplanes as weapons of defence, and to what extent such modifications will be justified.Hitherto undoubtedly guns have been the more effective, but this is chiefly due to the fact that they can fire at the sound of an invisible target, whereas our aeroplanes have little prospect of finding the enemy unless he is well illuminated.(9)   Improvements in the methods of manipulating searchlights and in the training of the detachments have resulted in hostile aeroplanes having been picked up and held for increasingly long/periods
periods by our searchlights and, during the last raid, one of our aeroplanes was able to engage the enemy, 5 Illumination of hostile machines,(1) Por the moment the most important factor in an efficient defence is undoubtedly the illumination of the target.    The small 60 cm, searchlight which was supplied for Home Defence, though effective against the old type of Zeppelin, is not sufficiently powerful to deal with aeroplanes flying at 11,000 feet, or with the latest type of camouflaged Zeppelin flying at 18,000 feet,(2) A few 150 c,m, searchlights have been obtained from a French firm and the supply of a considerable number of home manu-factured 120 cm, searchlights will shortly commence0A new type of carbon which is being manufactured will increase the range of searchlights to a considerable extent,(3) Sound Locators to enable searchlights to be directed on an invisible, but audible, target are also being supplied, and parachute flares, which are fired from guns, are being manufactured Experiments are also being carried out with powerful ground flares which it is hoped will illuminate up to a great height and enable the searchlights to locate, the enemy.(4) These improvements, will, it Is hoped, have the effect of turning the scale in favour of the illumination of the target. It remains to be seen whether the guns or the aeroplanes will derive the greater advantage. 6.        Types of gunsft(1) The most efficient A,A, gun in use for Home Defence is the 3&quot; 20 cwt.   The 18 Pr. and the 13 Pr. 9 cwt gun (which is a mobile gun) come next in order of merit, but both are considerably inferior to the 3&quot; 20 cwt.(2) The whole of the fixed defences in London and the South Fast of England, with the exception of 35 - 18 Prs., forming theWestern
Western portion of the London gun barrier, and 4 guns at small Isolated defences, consist of 3&quot; 20 cwt guns.This gun, howaver, wears badly. Experiments are being made with a view to prolonging its life and providing it with a heavier shell which will have a longer range and a greater radius of action.(3)   Arrangements are also being made to provide the 13 Pr. 9 cwt mobile gun with an efficient mounting, and to effect other improvements which will, it is hoped, improve the ballistics and enable a heavier shell to be used-.(4)   The need of a longer range gun-firing a heavier shell is however increusing.     It was hoped that a supply of 100 - 4&quot; guns was about to be arranged for, but owing to difficulty in granting the necessary priority for the manufacture of these guns; it is understood that the War Office proposal to that effect will not materialize.7.    -   The Balloon Apron Wing, R.F.-C.(1)   After a series of experiments authority was obtained In October 1917 for the formation of a Balloon Apron Wing for the close protection of London.(2)   The Balloon Wing is designed to furnish 20 Aprons, each consisting of 3 Gacquot captive balloons 500 yards apart connected by a horizontal wire from which are suspended steel wires 1,000 feet In length at 25 yards intervals.     Any aeroplanes flying into the aprons would be put out of action.(3)   At present aprons can be raised to a height of 8,000 feet, but larger Oacquot balloons are being provided ?rtiich will enable the apron to be raised to 11,000 feet.(4) Although it is of course possible for hostile machines to fly over these aprons (the average height at which they now carry out raids by night is about 11,000 feot) and although aprons can/only
only &quot;be placed at Intervals, theyundoubtedly^nav^ moral effect on the enemy and deter any except the boldest pilots from descending to an altitude from which bombs can be dropped with accuracy on vulnerable points.(5)     At present 3 aprons are actually in operation, and it is hoped to complete the remainder at the rate of 4 per month. 8. Machine guns.(1)     In order to deal with the case of enemy machines descend-ing over vulnerable points in the defended areas to such low altitudes as to render gun fire impracticable, 300 Lewis guns have been suited for the close protection of all important vulnerable points in London and the South East of England.(2)    Arrangements have also been made for machine guns with Home Defence Garrison and Field Army Troops to be supplied with high-angle mountings.9. Communications and Information.i.(1)     The communications throughout the defences in the South East of England consist of direct telephone lines to local centres which in their turn are connected to the Headquarters of the London A.A.Defence Area at the Horse Guards.Direct lateral communication between local centres is also provided for where necessary.(2)    A Wireless system has been established for tho communica-tion of information as to the movements and the height of hostile aircraft from our aeroplanes, specially detailed for these duties, to Receiving W/T Stations suitably disposed in the London and other defended areas.     The latter are telephonically connect-ed&apos;to the Headquarters of the Area.(3)     In addition to the information received concerning the move-rants of hostile aircraft, from various anti-aircraft and flying stations,.special military observation posts, located at/various
various points of vantage, supply such information by telephone to the Headquarters of the area, whence it is transmitted to the defences concerned.These posts include specially constructed &quot;Listening Posts&quot; on the East Kent coast by means of which approaching aircraft can be detected while still far out to sea.(4)        Similar information is also supplied by the Admiralty by W/T from ships at sea.Direct telephone communications have been established between the Horse Guards and Headquarters, R.F.C., Prance, and the Admiralty respectively, which are used for the constant interchange of information. 10.      General Scheme of Defence.(1)        The present scheme for the gun and light defences of London and the South East of England is shown in Appendix &quot;A&quot; .It will be observed that there are Naval A.A. guns in the Harwich, Thames &amp; tiedway and Dover A.A. Defence Commands to afford additional close protection to Naval establishments.     These come under the orders of the A.a. Defence Commander during air raids.(2)        The disposition of the squadrons R.F.C is shown in Appendix &quot;3&quot;.(3)        Arrangements have been made for the available day scout machines of the various units of the Training Division R.F.C., located near London and in the South East of England, to come under the orders of the General Officer Commanding, London A.A. Defence Area, to assist the defence against air raids by day.The total average number of these machines available is about 24.     They are allotted definite patrols or concentration centres.The detail of the above is given in Appendix nC&quot;.No night flying machines are available from these sources.
(4)     The Royal Naval Air Service do not now provide any fighting patrols for defence against air raids.(5)     The whole scheme of defence for London and the South East of England is shown on the accompanying map, from which it will he seen that while London is provided with an all round defence, its defences from North via East to South are considerably stronger than those on the West.(6)     The main lines of approach of enemy aeroplanes from the East are further crossed by a succession of defences, fixed guns, mobile guns, Illuminated zones for the operation of aeroplanes, the London gun barrier, further aeroplane zones, balloon aprons and finally the area covered by the fixed guns of the London defences proper.(Sgd)   French.Field Marshal, Commanding-in-Chief, HOME FORCES.General Headquarters, Home Forces,Horse Guards, S.W.1,17th January, 1918.
