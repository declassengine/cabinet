(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)MINISTRY OF SHIPPINGPLIES 0? Big MftMIALS ?BGM SPAIN.e memorandum on this subject circulated by theWnTstar of Munitions (G.To3501) on the 30th January 1918 has been examined in the Ministry of Shipping.2,    !Phe diversion of any British or controlled neutral ship to Spain involves the loss of a cargo of coal to Naval Stocks, the bunkering depots or to -France or to Italy.   It is notorious that there is insufficient tonnage available to meet these requirements *    Spanish vessels which are not controlled will only carry their coal to Spain and no doubt prefer to serve Spanish interests9 but some owners are willing to carry coal for British interests in- Spain if they are paid the market rates of the day for Spanish ports.Spanish tonnage on these terms and obtain British or controlled tonnage they directly rob tho bunkering depots of France or Italy of an equal quantity of coal,and tonnage is lost to the Alliance merely on a matter of price.4*    In these circumstances the policy of the Ministry of Shipping which is to charter Spanish tonnage on market terms . whenever it can be obtained does not seem to require justification by further argument than is provided in its letter To53153/17 of the 16th November last (printed as an Appendix to the Ministry -of Munitions1 memorandum) and the Shipping Controller asks that that policy may be endorsed at once by the War Cabinet.  He asks also that ths Ministry of Munitions may be instructed to arrange that the British interests in Spain whose products are essential to the conduct of the War may be enabled to charter Spanish -ships for their requirements under such financial guarantees as the circumstances of each case justify.In so far as British interests refuse to charter
5,    It will be gathered that the whole object cf the &quot;&quot;Shipping Controller is to avoid sending British ships to Spain. The rate to be paid on any British ships which are in fact sent as a result cf deliberate refusal to charter Spanish tonnage in order to force the hands  of the British Government is therefore a comparatively unimportant matter.    It is obvious that if a lower rate were charged for such ships3 all Spanish concerns serving the interests of the Allies, however, remotely, would cease to take Spanish vessels and run their sunplie-s of coal short so that they might claim the aid of cheap British tonnage as the only-means of enabling them to conduct their industryc This has already proved to be the case in connection with the Lead contracts and in view of the great difficulty in securing tonnage for coke, the Ministry of Shipping has in fact supplied the vessels under a special arrangement made under the Ministry of Munitions&apos; contract.    Discrimination in favour of British interests would moreover almost oertainly lead to political embarrassment in Spain as it is still the aim of the Spanish Government to force this country to carry Spain?s coal in British bottoms.    It is understood that the demand was made once more in connection with lord Cunliffefs recent negotiations and it would appear to be most impolitic to take any step which would unnecessarily revive this issue or lead the Spanish Government itself to direct Spanish owners to carry coal only for predominantly Spanish interests.60    If the policy of thj Ministry of Shipning is aooroved, no question of-making undue profits out of British Shinping for the British Exchequer will arise, since it is hoped that British tonnage will only be sent to Spain in exceptional cases and the Shipping Controller is unable to perceive why the United States and other consumers of Spanish minerals should not pay whatever increase in price is necessitated by the rise in the market price of coali   In any case the provision of cheap British tonnage forthe
the Bio Tinto Mines would involve an indirect subsidy to the United States and Prance at the expense of this country or whichever Ally was forced to employ a neutral to carry the cargo which the British ship would otherwise have taken.7c.    Meanwhile it is understood that the position of the Eio Tinto Mines in particular may become critical,8c    The Shipping Controller cannot acquiesce in the development of a situation which may result in an emergency demand for the diversion of a British ship at short notice in order to maintain the supply of Pyrites.   He therefore proposes &quot;to charter for Huelva Spanish vessels if any are available and to put down their cargoes under circumstances which will leave the coal available for these Mines.9.    The second point on which the Ministry of Munitions seeka decision is this:-&quot;The suggestion made by Mr. Crosby should be adopted, and an official assurance given him that   if this be the fact, the British Government , apart from the particular instance of outward freights to Spain, is not guilty of profiteering in the manner suggested1&apos;,10.     The Shipping Controller takes the strongest exception tothe action of the Ministry of Emitions in this matter.    He desiresto point out that the impression which Mr, Crosby appears to havecarried away from his interview with Sir Keith Price cannot fail tohave the most injurious effects in embarrassing negotiations withthe American Government, and in particular our requests for AmericanShipping for Allied service which is absolutely vital during the .next few months.   The whole suggestion ofnprofiteeringft arises outof the question of the Spanish freights&quot;.   Sir Keith price waspresumably aware of the terms of the Ministryfs letter of the 16fchwhen he saw Mr. Crosby.   That letter, as the Treasury point out,sufficiently, disposes of the ^legation of &quot;profiteering&quot; but itsargument does not seem to have been conveyed to Mr, Crosby nor doesthe Treasury?s proposal that a copy of it should be sent to himappear to have been acted upon-
11.    The letter sent by the Ministry of Munitions to the Treasury on the 22nd December is vitiated by the failure to perceive that the Spanish freights have been forced to their present ea erbitant level by Spanish competition, not by the Ministry of shipping, although the position is made clear in this Ministry&apos;s letter of the 16th November.12.    In the circumstances the Shipping Controller does not propose to defend himself against the general charge of being &quot;guilty of profiteering&quot; but asks that the Treasury may exnlain the matter fully to the United States Government and also to the Chairman of the American Board.13.    It may be added that there is now reason to expect that, as a result of-the conclusion of the &quot;Commercial Agreement with Spain, more Spanish vessels will come to this country for coal. A certain number has already &quot;been requisitioned by the Spanish Government for the purpose.    It is&apos; also rumoured that the Snanish Government is about to fix coal freights.    A considerable drop in Spanish freights may therefore be hoped for, but they are perhaps unlikely to fall much below 200/- in any event.15th February 1918.
