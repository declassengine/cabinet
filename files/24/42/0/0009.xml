TE3   AITMJAL   OOl^SHlSCB HELD IN   NOTTINGHAM,ONOff THE LABOUR PARTY, JAN. 2dt 24 &amp; 25, 1318.I c&amp;rculate for the information of my colleagues a report&apos; on the Labour Party, Conference, by an official of the Ministry of Labour.GBO. H. ROBERTS,13,2,18,
REPORT ON THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE LABOUR PARTY, HELD AT NOTTINGHAM EANUARY 23, 24, and 25, 1918,The general impression made upon my mind by the Labour Party Conference is that there are at present elements of very real danger in the movement.   The spontaneous attitude of tne great body of the organised workers is doubtless one of loyalty in the present national crisis;   but that attitude is considerably influenced by a failure to understand the real nature of the military and the industrial needs;   by the food difficulties of the nresent time;   by a feeling of war weariness;   and by the activities of those sections of the movement which are animated by pacifist and by revolutionary aims,     Thore is thus a largo body of workers who may at any moment pass from an attitude of loyalty or of moderate satisfaction and oritipism to an attitude of open hostility;   and the danger is increased by the fact that these workers have far fewer opportunities of hearing the case for the war and for the Government than of hearing hostile and embittered attacks upon them.     It was clear at the Conference than when a responsible and reasoned statement is made Euch statement will carry great weight, if not always preponderant weight, with a relatively representative gathering of workers. Unfortunately,really representative gatherings of workers are at the moment difficult to get, and such meetings of Trade Union branches, Trades Counoils, Local Labour parties and other organ-ieations are held, are attended chiefly by the more revolution-ary and pacifist sections of the members.    Under the existing circumstances it is doubtless inevitable;   but the question arises as to whether means can be taken to get responsible and reasoned statements put more widely, frequently and effectively before the workers.The pacifist and the revolutionary sections of the movement appear to have given up altogether the objects of the Leeds Convention.     I heard no referenoe at the Conference to Workers&apos; and Ifaldiers1 Councils;   but that the Russian revolution exercised great influence upon a great body of the organised workers was made quite clear on several occasions during the Conference, especially at the meeting which was held on the evening of January 22nd for the purpose of providing an opportunity for the whole cf the fraternal delegates to speak.     On that occasion JiliLitvinoff made a violent speech, glorifying the aims and the results of the Bolshevik regime and practically oalling upon Btitish workers to follow the example of Russia.    &amp;,Litvinoff!s speech was enthusiastically applauded by the audience, and one heard no expression of dissent.   In marked contrast to this were the expressions of dissent from the moderate arguments presented at the same meeting by KCVandervalde and M.Renaudel, and the coldness of the reception given to M.Renaudel compared with that given to M.Longuet.    This meeting appeared to indioate that the pacifist and the revolutionary elements were in a marked aocondancy.This apparent ascendancy of these elements was also indicated by the speeches of many of the delegates, and by the applause which was accorded to them.    One may discount the speeches of the street-corner type, and those of men who have over and over again taken up an attitude of marked hostility to the Government and to the prosecution of the war; - but there remains sufficient evidence of the existence of a wide-spread feeling of vague uncertainty and cf positive unrestr^ and of a not over-scrupulous/ organisation
organisation of that feeling into anti-Government and anti-war activities.On the other hand, the Presidential Address of Mr,Purdy, which was a vigorous plea for the consolidation of all labour forces in the successful prosecution of the war, met with rather more support than dissent; - which seems to indicate, in view of the reception given to M.Litvinoff on the previous evening, that at labour Party Conferences, as elsewhere, the mood of many is determined for the time being, by the emotional appeal that is made to it at the moment.     But even allowing for this, there ar)Deared to be real and wide-spread support for Mr, Purdy&apos;s views,There were several clear indications that however much vocal support may be given to violent speeches as td calls to revolutionary action, the R-rcat majority of the organised workers are not $ot prepared to go to extremes.    For example, a motion to suspend tho standing orders in order that the Man Power Bill should be considered was defeated by the adoption of the previous question,    A resolution on tho Agenda declaring &quot;that it is irregular and inadvisable that any member of the Executive Committee should retain his official^connection with the Party after the acceptance of an official position with the Government&quot; was defeated, as a card vote, by 1,561,000 votes to 794,000.    And another resolution, also on the Agenda, declaring &quot;that it is contrary to the interests of the wor3dng-classe3 for Labour Members of Parliament to remain members of the Coalition Government&quot; was defeated,   as a Card vote, by 1,085,000 votes to 72,200.In reviewing the temper of the Conference several important matters have to be borno in mind.    First, it is very doubbfei if the Conference can be regarded as really representative of the Labour Party,     In view of the manner in which Labour de:; c^fces. have been elected by their Societies to other recent coiifeienees it is more than probable that a number of affiliated Soc: et,ies were represented by supporters of a minority policyr   S g c c nd, the influence of the difficulties of food supplies, and one vigour with which the feeling provoked by these difficulties has been exploited, were considerable factora in fche production of expressions of unrest and of revolutionary tendenciest   Third, the organised workers have recently had far more destructive than constructive appeals made to thorn.     Fourth, there is a tendency for large sections of the movement to de^elope &quot;swelled head&quot;.    The Representation of the People Bill, the framing of tho new Constitution of the party, and the issue of the Party&apos;s draft report on Reconstruction - &quot;Labour and tho Hew Social Order&quot; - have revived the hopfes^of 1906 and it is widely Believed that Labour has a real chance of coming into full political power in the near future.     That belief is re-inforced by the entrance of the Co-operative movement into the field of active politics, and by the boliof that tho recent Labour Party Conference on War Aims compelled the Primo Minister to toe the line.Taking all the circumstances into account, the temper of tho Conference is exceedingly difficult to diagnose.     It was somewhat loss revolutionary than I had anticipated, but there was enough to show that there are elements of serious danger m the present situation,     Tho chief danger, I believe, anc.ee from the fact that within the organised Labour movement, most of the members of which are inarticulate and over-tired, there is a minority more or loss violently revolutionary, constantly and/ vociferously
vociferously articulate, and becoming more and more effectively organised as a destructive force.A great deal depends upon Mr. Arthur Henderson.     His change of attitude towards the war has given the pacifist section of the movement an influence which it did not possess when Mr, Macdonald was its leading figure, and the opportunity which he has, and the energy which he is exercising, in reconstituting and in rebuilding the movement, give him &amp; power immeasurably beyond that possessed by any other labour leader to-tLay,   There is danger hero from the personal aspect which events and circumstances tend to take - a certain door-mat for example is now being used very effectively as an altar-cloth;   and from the liability of immediately possible tactical successes to obscure larger strategical views;   but I am convinced that Mr. Henderson&apos;o influence is steadily directed towards holding the national movement closely together.   That that is the direction of his influence was made clear by his speeches at the Conference and by a speech which I recently heard him deliver at a delegate meeting of the Woolwich labour Party and -she Woolwich Trades and labour Council*    Mr. Henderson is determined to aee a labour Cabinet in power, probably with himself as Prime Minister, and he realises that the more revolutionary sections mustjje restrained from disrupting the whole labour movement, and/proving the greatest obstacle to the realisation of that ideal.(Signed) Edward MaCegan, 4/2/1918.
