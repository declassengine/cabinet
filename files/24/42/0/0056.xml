WEEKLY REPORT ON SWEDEN?, VIII.

(Feb. 18th, 1918)

In Sweden all eyes are turned in the direction of Finland where, as in Russia, civil war is raging between the forces of the Provisional Social Democratic Government and those of the Finnish Government. The exact situation is very obscure. It may be taken as fairly certain that the Southern portion of the country including Helsingfors, Viborg and Nystadt is in the hands of what is practically a Bolshevik Administration supported by the de faoto Government at Petrograd and what remains of the Russian garrison. The Finnish Government appear to be in possession of Uleaborg and it seems to be certain that their forces have captured Knopio which is one of the more important towns in the interior. ?, a town of nearly 50,000 inhabitants, has been the scene of fierce fighting and is probably in the hands of the Socialists. In several places, notably at Viberg, the Red Guards, aided and abatted by Russian soldiers and the criminal elements of the inhabitants, have committed terrible excesses. In. the capital (Helsingfors) there is a reign of terror; but the British Consul General has not as yet reported any loss of life among the British Colony.

The army of the Finnish Government in under the orders of General Mannerheim, who commanded a Russian Brigade in the Bukewina before the disruption of the Russian forces last year. He is said to have from 8000 - 100,000 men at his disposal, but it seems improbable that his troops are well-armed or in possession of an adequate quantity of ammunition. According to the Petrograd Telegraph Agency the "Revolution of the, Proletariat&apos; has been proclaimed in Finland, and it is announced that all authority now belongs solely


ft *to the working classes and its organs,     In Helsingfors the printing presses of all anti-Socialist newsseiners have been seized. It is certain that the Petrograd Government are assisting the Socialists in Finland with arms and ammunition, and that regiments of Red Guards will be sent if this is not prevented by the Finnish Government.     Everything in fact, noints to a revolution on Bolshevik lines.     It is probable that the Finnish Government will receive a certain amount of sureptitious help from Sweden, but it is not likely that the present Liberal-Socialist Government will o-ctively intervene in Finland.     It would seem that - *oert from foreign intervention - the deciding fnctor in the Cfcvil war will be the amount of support in men, money and military material the ^etrograd Government is prepared to send to the Bolsheviks at Helsingfors. Malting al?l allowance for the chaos reigning in Russia, the dis-banding of the armies on the front must &apos;.ave released a relatively large quantity of guns, rifles and ammunition, not to sneak of provisions of all kinfs.     It is difficult to see where General Mcnnerheim can obtain war material in sufficient quantities to cope with his rivals.     A great part of Finland must he a very difficult terrain from a military point of view and much will de-pend on whether the Russian Meet is used in the interests of t e Finnish Socialists.     If the latter gain command of the sea it Beems almost imnossible that the Finnish Government can for long maintain a struggle agrinst such unequal odds.&quot;    There remains, of course, the unknown factor of foreign intervention.     *s there 13 every likelihood of the Baltic becoming i Germ:n lske it is im-probable that she will look on with comnlacency at the establish-*mentof a Bolshevik Government in Finland.Meanwhile meetings are being held in Stockholm both for : nd against giving official assistance to the Finnish Government.
The Socialists with l!r. Bran ting at their head propose mediation by.... (the Swedish Government between the contending factions and a reso-lution to that effect was passed at a mass meeting in Stockholm on Peb. 11th.     The extreme Socialists &amp;nd the Conservatives re-pudiate mediation.     Speakers at sos-e of the Socialist meetings o^ehjy hinted at a rising in Sweden if the Government were to assist the Finnish &quot;bourgeois&apos;&apos; Government.     This situation has placed the Socialist members of the Eden Cabinet nnd their Liberal colleagues in. a difficult position,     Humours are even current thot the ^rime Minister offeree to resign,   however this may be it is certain that the Cabinet is greatly embarrassed by events in Fin-land end there is ho present sign that they h:,ve any definite policy with regard to that country,The question of the possession of the -aland Islands is ncturally exciting great interest in Sweden.     The Ictest development has been the visi/t to Stockholm of a deputation of Islanders who ore-sented an address to the King proposing their incorporation with Sweden.     The signatories of,this . ddress represent obout 90$ of the adult inhebitants, eo that if the doctrine of self-determina-tion is to prevail there is no fu.. ther .doubt to whom the Islands should belong, the more so as the inhabitants, almost to a man, ere of pure Swedish descent.     The Xing of Sweden expressed Pleasure at receiving ine Deputation ;:nd the hope that in agreement with a free and independent Finland, the-Swedish Government vrould find a way to overcome the difficulties connected with the realisation of the desires of the Colanders.     The Russian garrison in the Islands would appear to have created a reign of terror.     There is a persistent rumour that the Russian soldiers, having thrown off :*11 discipline, are committing atrooities similar to th&apos;*se which f-r seme months have been so common in Russia and Poland.
IleaiFfhili? the Swedish Government, having received no invitation to do so, have drooped their project of sending a delegate to Brest-Litovs/i, to discuss the Aaland Question..: s the result of the visit of the Swedish Commercial delegates to London a provisional arrangement has been arrived at satisfac-tory to both parties.     There seems to be a fair prospeot of a final understanding on the completion of the negotiations.     The details of the provisional arrangement have not at present been published.
