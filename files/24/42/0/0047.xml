.f!^fo.it is Jhe Property of -/: :ty&apos;s Government)SECRET.MINISTRY  OF  FOOD.ort for Week ending Wednesday, February 13, 1918.PART L-ACTION  TAKEN.Control of Supplies, Prices, and Distribution.Allied Requirements. Lord Rhondda has received through Mr. Sheldon the following cablegram from Mr. Hoover : &quot; I should like to know Lord Rhondda&apos;s views upon complete cessation of brewing on. both sides of the Atlantic. The competition of the Allies here in purchase of barley against its use for brewing and especially for bread dilution here is driving it to unheard of prices and forcing other grain up in sympathy. We have a great out-cry from our people against our drastic measures while barley is going to England for beer and intrinsically it would add materially to bread resources on both sides.&quot;The shipping situation in the shipping of food supplies from America still continues to be precarious owing to the railway congestion and other causes.Mr. Owen Smith reports that on the 31 st January unshipped purchases autho-rised for that month for the United Kingdom amounted to over 83,000 tons and the unshipped purchases in Canada to nearly 10,000 tons. He cables that during February it is hoped to ship from the United States 98,230 tons of meats and fats and oils and 18,000 tons from Canada. There will then remain for shipment in March from the United States approximately 135,000 tons of these food-stuffs and frozen meat.The United States Food Administration have notified Mr. Owen Smith that purchases for the British Army Canteen Committee and other canteens must be made through the Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive..Payments through the British Government Commercial Agency in New York for the week ending February 9th amounted to 6,244,311 dollars and in Canada to 2,188,033 dollars.Large contracts have been closed for Canadian butter.   .Mr. Owen Smith reports that the supply of Canadian hogs is light, but that he is buying allthat is offered by Canadian packers for which he estimates about five million dollars monthly will be required.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. As anticipated in; the Report for the week ending the 30th January, 1918, it has been decided to stop buying raw lard in America on the ground that it will be cheaper to buy refined lard than to pay English refiners. A meeting will shortly be held with the refiners in the United Kingdom to ascertain whether their plant can be economically used in the manufacture of compound lard. A substantial economy should be effected.Bacon arriving from China will be put direct into cold siore and used for emergency requirements.It is thought that the imports of bacon during the coming fortnight will enable this Ministry to make a satisfactory contribution of bacon for the rationing scheme which comes into operation for London and the Home Counties on the 25th February.A meeting of the Bacon Advisory Committee and other representatives of the trade was held on the 12th February to discuss the proposed flat rate for bacon. A member of the Consumers&apos; Council attended the meeting. It was agreed to adopt a single retail price for all kinds of bacon sold without bone. It is hoped to give effect to the decision at an early date.Butter. Further purchases in the United States of America amount to 93 tons, at prices ranging from 44 to 47 cents per lb. f.a.s. in New York. Arrivals of butter from the States amount approximately to 700 tons. A further purchase of 16 tons of butter has been made in Canada, at prices from 38f to 39i- cents per lb. No butter has arrived this week from the Argentine ; the total quantity of butter on the water on February 9th, was 17,127 tons.A.  (33)4987-2  Pk 1   110 2/18  E &amp; Sa
There will be a distribution of butter at the end of the week, amounting to one-eighth of the amount applied for in February by the trade.Gerea.ls.-The Oatmeal (Restriction) Order, 1918, prohibits as from 10th February 1918, the use of oatmeal or oat products except for purposes of human food. An exception is made in case of oatmeal or oat products manufactured for rjther purposes prior to that,date, or which may thereafter become-or be-unfit -for human food. It further prohibits the damaging of these substances and provides for the determination of any doubt as to whether such substances are or are not unfit for human food.-The Barley (Export from Ireland) Order, 1918, prohibits after 18th February, 1918, except under licence &quot;of the &quot;Food Controller, the &quot;export or shipment of any barley from Ireland to any destination outside Ireland.        .  ;Cn.eese.--lt is hoped to make a distribution shortly of controlled cheese, provided that cargoes arrive from-the United States&apos; of America, Canada, New. Zealand and Holland ; the total quantity of New Zealand cheese now on the water is 5,134&apos;tons, whioh should arrive in the course of March ; 5,000 tons are expected from the United States of America, before the end of February but difficulties of inland transport may delay its arrival until March. The bulk of the supplies of old season Canadian-cheese will be required by the War Office, which is arranging for the inspection of the stocks at present in the country; until this survey is completed and the requirements of the War Office.stated,it will not be possible to say whether any of these supplies will be available for civilian consumption. - - &apos; &apos;I . Consumers&apos; CouncUj-The third meeting of this Council was held at the Ministry of Food on Tuesday, 12th February. Sir Charles Bathurst, Sir John Beale; Sir Harold Stuart^ Major Carr, and Mr, Vivian. attended, and the following matters were discussed : (1) The distribution and rationing of sugar ; - (2) Further restrictions on cakes and pastry ; :(3) The proposed flat rate for tea ; . ; (4) Feeding-stuffs for poultry.       - .-, . .  .     .  - &apos; .Feeding Stuffs. The Cattle Feeding Stuffs (Maximum Prices) Order, 1918, which was made by the Food Controller on Friday, 8th February, supersedes and extends the Maximum Prices Order for concentrated cattle feeding-stuffs made last November. The prices stated in the original carder are continued except as to a modification in respect of compound cakes, and, in addition, maximum prices are fixed for brewers&apos; and distillers&apos; grains, malt culms, and kiln dust. It fixes one average price for; millers&apos; offals instead of four prices for different, grades as in the previous Order. It gives the Food Controller certain powers of control over the compound cake manu-facturer as&apos;to manufacture, and deals with various points /of detail which have arisen in the course of administration of the previous Order.Food Hoarding. The Food Hoarding &apos; (Amnesty) Order, 1918, dated 11th February, 1918, embodies the provisions as to a week of .grace which were referred, to in last week&apos;s Report. In response to a number of requests for directions as to&apos; what stocks may be considered ordinary and proper,.Lord Rhondda has intimated-that two or three weeks&apos; stocks heed not be considered excessive, but that stocks in excess of that amount must only be held by people living in a situation remote froni ordinary sources of supply. ;&apos;, --     vMeat.--The arrangements which have been made to meet the calls arising from, unexpected emergencies are gradually developingJnto a. satisfactory organisation. . &quot;&quot;   The work has been greatly facilitated-by the establishmeut of the Associated Importers Committee which distributes the supplies of imported meat under the control of the Director, of Meat Supplies.Figures and maps have been prepared showing  ....&apos; (i) those areas of &quot;the country which may be expected to be self-supporting; (2) those areas which should have surplus of home production for the supply.of other areas&apos;; and &apos;.: ^(3) those areas which must rely .to . a large extent upon. importation from . . - abroad or from/the areas having a surplus. The last; class, are already absorbing a great deal of the meat now arriving from the United States, aud it does, not appear at present that it will be possible to build up any considerable reserve of frozen meat. Live. stock is coming forward a little more freely to the - market, arid- movement of the curve is distinctly upwai d but very gradual. &apos; &quot; &apos; *
f &apos;- ;*Tb&apos;e immediate&apos;&apos; situation is certainly hot so acute&quot; as iiwas at the-beginning of the month, and the initiation of&apos; voluntary rationing schehresjh numerous districts has ensured more equitable distribution.and thereby removed a grieyancewhich was more keenly resented than&quot; the scarcity of supplies.&apos;&apos;     &apos;&quot;*- &apos;&apos;-The Meat [Licencing of Wholesale Dealers) Order has been made, requiring all wholsesde meat dealers, to be licenced&apos;&apos;by the/Ministry of Food.: .   \ The;Canned,Meats [Maximum&apos; Prices) Order has been issued, fixing maximum prices for the principal varities of canned meats.        - &quot; : &apos;-     &apos; 1 * [- &apos; :- &apos;; It is; intended&apos;shortly to issue an Order: ^amalgamating the Cattle (Sales) Order and the Sheep (Sales) Order, and providing for the sale of cattle and sheep on a dead weight.basis.&apos;, i..&apos; - &apos;-&apos; *. &quot;-&apos;y &apos; - : &apos; : &apos;&quot;&apos; -&apos;&quot;&quot;- :----- -Milk^The Condensed Milk (Distribution) &apos;Order-was issued on the 8th February,by which the Food Controller takes power to control the distribution of available supplies of condensed f milk. The necessary forms are being sent to wholesalers, manufacturers, and importers for issue to the. trade ; retailers, caterers, and institu-tiins must make application to the firm dealt with in 1917, stating requirements for 3918, which must not exceed the quantities obtained in 1917.  &apos;:Supplies will be allocated pro rata on the basis of the applicants supplies during 1917, if it is found;impossible to meet the applications in full. i&apos;.The Milk (Registration of Dealers) Postponement Order,; was issued on the 7th February,, the effect of which is ,to postpone - for r-one. week the necessity of a wholesale -dealer-in; milk to obtain a licence from the Ministry of Food.   ,.      \;-.Oils and Fais.-Although&apos; the production of margarine in this country&apos;continues to remain at a satisfactory level, and, although there is every expectation, of the record output of the last&quot; few weeks being eclipsed in the near&apos; future,, the question of the supply of sufficient raw material to meet the requirements of.plant, old.and&apos;new, in this country is causing very considerable anxiety. It should -be remembered that the increased home output of imargarine Is modified by the-appreciable decrease in supplies . of imported margarine, and by the&apos;! almost complete1 cessation1 &apos;6f butter imports. Under these circumstances, it is a matter of imperative necessity that the import&apos;of oilseeds and-oils should; be .kept as close as; is practically possible to the figures to which the sanction of the War Cabinet was accorded.Oilseeds.- Owing to the troubles in Argentine the shipment of linseed is delayed, and it would appear that the first shipments will not be made until the end of &quot;March.Egyptian and West Coast seed-and kernel supplies are good, but from other sources the shipments are small. -     i. &apos; . ;- .Tea. The s.s.&quot; Glenartney,&quot;,with 1,478,3^9 lbs. of tea on board, was sunk by torpedo on 6th February.&quot; : ;,The first ballot for National &quot;Control tea will be held on 18th February. , -....     ^ - f. . f m. &apos; &apos; - -:&apos;.      ; f. &apos;      t-OpAL&quot; ORGANISATION: - , &quot;      . r  -  &quot;  , -&quot;&apos;  - : .;-;&apos;.;&apos;Administration. Lord Rhondda has-expressed the opinion that schemes for meat rationing ought to be introduced in important industrial districts&apos;at an early date, and has stated that he is ready to consider the question of making their introduction in such areas compulsory. Reports from the Commissioners from all parts of the country emphasise the increasing difficulty experienced in dealing with the situation, owing to the shortage of meat supplies, which is at present aggravated by the unequal distribution of the supplies that are available; and they almost Unanimously agreet as to the very great necessity for immediate action, such as the Food Controller now advocates, in order to allay the increasing unrest in large centres of labour, such as munition factories and colliery districts.It is, for example, reported that in the mining district of the Forest of Dean the average meat supply under the present arrangement works out, at under 7 ounces per head, owing to the fact that the demands on the regular butchers were restricted, as pigs and forest sheep, which did not appear on the retailers accounts, were freely slaughtered. ,.&quot;,Pending the meeting of the Road Transport Board, to be called by the Board of Trade, there has been, no further development in the coordination of transport. There is, however, a strong feeling that the establishment of -a-compulsory scheme o . transport control.is necessary, for. the successful carrying out.-of. any rationing scheme.
Labour Representation. -During the past week 13 applications&apos;for sanction to enlarge Food Control Committees have been approved, and 26 farther applications have been received. In almost every case as in the previous week -the demand has been made by Labour Organisations in order.to give additional representation to labour. .Rationing Scheme. The whole country may now be said to be embraced in rationing schemes, which are uniform in essentials, though varying in details according to local requirements. .Applications have been received from many of the industrial centres for the addition of meat to the rationed food-stuffs. It is hoped by this means to reduce the queue trouble, the chief further cause of this now being the difficulty experienced by the consumer in obtaining supplies of meat in any degree commensurate with his requirements.National Kitchens. Interest in the setting up of national kitchens is developing rapidly, and in some areas it is reported that they have become an immediate necessity. - ;- . ;Shortage of Supplies. Numerous complaints of food shortage have been received during the week from many different parts of the country, and from many different sources. The Clyde Ship-workers, the Admiralty workers at Grangemouth, timber-fellers near Bristol, and workers in factory construction in Lancashire are mentioned amongst the classes from whom or on whose behalf representations have been made. Great difficulty has also been experienced by railwaymen in obtaining supplies during long journeys. It appears, however, that the small colliery strike in Staffordshire referred to in last week&apos;s Report, was prevented from taking place. Some producing districts are inclined to resent the removal of their supplies to other areas.Labour Priority and Exemptions. Numerous applications have been received from various trades, which are being considered. Although priority has been obtained in many cases for fitters and men required for the building trade in con-nection with margarine factories, the greatest difficulty has been experienced in obtaining the necessary labour.7:6 applications for exemption from military service have received attention.Enforcement.For the week ending the 2nd February, returns have been received of 446 prosecu-tions in England and Wales of which 394 resulted in convictions. - - \&apos;Full returns for Scotland have not yet been received..85 prosecutions were in connection with potatoes.55 ,, ,, ,, public meals.44        ,,: ,, ,, meat.28     - ,, ,, butter.23 ,, ,, ,, jam.Prosecutions for hoarding have increased in number, during the week, of which 17 were successful.

PART II.-SUMMARY OF. THE FOOD POSITION.* &apos;     &apos; Imports.  f^,&apos; &apos;.   -t . .     ,The improvement noted in last week&apos;s Report has not been maintained. The aggregate weight of principal foods imported was 131,800 tons.in the week ending February 9th, while in the previous week , it had been 15.5,000 tons (Table A). The falling off is mainly attributable to cereals. Of wheat and flour 20,000 tons less were imported, of barley 3,500 tons less, and&apos;of maize 15,600 tons less than in the previous week. On the other hand, the same amount of meat arrived ; as in the. previous week, and bacon and hams increased 4,800 tons, reaching the highest level for eightweeks.      , - .  ..... ?. -        !   a      - &apos;        &apos;-; &apos; -        - -    . -    .A large importation of sugar brings the average for 1918 so far to nearly the same level as the first six weeks of 1917... No rice arrived, and only 214 tons of tea, but in both these commodities, there have been good imports-in the earlier weeks of this year. . ; .Consumption.Meat. Owing to the effects of the various restrictions and regulations affecting the distribution of meat the markets included in Table C are no longer representative of consumption, but suggest a greater fall since last year than is the casein the country as a whole.Returns from over 200 markets (including more cattle than those covered in Table C) show that the numbers of cattle stalled in the weeks ending January 19th, 26th, February 2nd, February 9th, were in 1918 respectively 50 per cent., 381- Per cent., 48 per cent, and 38-1 Per cent, fewer than in 1917. Similar returns for sheep show deficits of 48 per cent., 65 per cent., 64 per cent, and 56 per cent, respectively for the same dates. These figures show no indication of improvement in .the situation. -      -At the Central Meat Market, London, and three provincial meat markets, the quantities of home-fed meat in the weeks ending January 19th, 26th, and February 2nd, were in 1918 respectively 36 per cent., 47 per cent., and 46 per cent.-below last year (Table B), and in the week ending February 9th in London the supply was 48 per cent, below last year.The supply of foreign meat (Table B, with later information for the Central Market,) has been less than half that of last year in each of the four weeks in question.Consumption of Flour.The bakers&apos; and retailers&apos; returns for the consumption of flour (Tables E and L) show an increase of \\ per cent, in the four weeks January 6th-February 2nd over the previous four weeks. As was pointed out in connection with the returns for the four, weeks December 10th-January 5th, there was a fall in December owing to the inclusion of Christmas week ; the subsequent increase has brought the consumption back to the November level; similar movements in these three periods have taken place in all food control divisions. An equal rise of 4^- per cent, took place from December 1916 to January 1917.The consumption in January 1918 was 1^ per cent, above that in January 1917. When the general shortage of other foods during the month is considered, it appears to be very remarkable that so slight an addition was made to the use of flour. Potatoes have not yet contributed seriously to economy in bread-making, since only 350 tons of potatoes are reported as having been used with 102,000 tons of flour.Retailers&apos; stocks have fallen in some districts, as the following table shows : . ...

Stocks.As a result of the farm stock-taking of January 15th, considerable revision of the stocks estimated on January 1st has been necessary ; wheat, barley and oats are written down to the extent of 112,000 tons, 168,000 tons, and 501,000 tons, respec-tively. As part Of the stock of oats is in Ireland, where there was no stock-taking, it has to be assumed that the depletion there has been proportional to that in Great Britain; for this reason the estimate of the total oats stock must not be regarded as Certain (Table G). The wheat stock on February 1st, 1918, was 418,000 tons higher than on February 1st, 1917, whereas on September 1st, 1917, it was 700,000 tons higher than a year before. Thus the position, though not so good as on September 1st, is still better than last year. The relations between the stocks of barley and of oats at the various dates are similar to those in the case of wheat. The stock of maize continues to be low as compared with last year.,The stocks of butter and margarine on February 1st, 1918, were each only oile-quarter of the stock a year ago. The stock of all kinds of meat was 90,500 tons oh February 1st, 1918, almost exactly the same as a year ago, but 12,000 tons less than amonth ago. ......Of tea the stock has improved 70 per cent, since January 1st, but is still 46 per Cent: lower than a year ago. The position of sugar though not quite so favourable as last month is very much better than that on February 1st, 1917. i.  . , jj,Prices, Wholesale and Retail.The Gazette average price of wheat has risen U)d. to 72s. a quarter. A year ago it was 76s. a quarter-(Table F). ;There has been a very small but nearly general rise in retail prices during January (Table H). The only exceptions are bread and sugar which are unchanged and foreign beef, tea and potatoes which have fallen. The general movement of retail food prices from January 1917 has been re-calculated on the basis of quantitiesconsumed by the home population in the Autumn of ] 917    H numbers are as follows:-    .                                            ihe lesultl&quot;g mdex-&apos; January 1st, 1917 - - -      .      .               \AnJuly 1st, 1917      - - .     .     .     &quot;     &quot;August 1st, 1917 . r. - -                           &apos;   JiiISeptember 1st, 1917 -                                 &quot;   , ji2October 1st, 1917 - . .     .     . &quot;          &quot;   \%LNovember 1st, 1917 - 1      .                         !J5fDecember 1st, 1917 :                                &quot;   lf,o2&quot; January 1st, 1918 -                                        &quot;February 1st, 1918- -                           &quot;The stationariness of prices during this winter is noteworthy. The prices of subsidiary foods shown in Table K did not change during January, except that American lard rose 2 per cent, and tapioca 3 per cent.
