The principal complications arose from the sudden development under war conditions of aircraft work as a new industry, carried on in establishments previously engaged in trades so different as the engineering, building, cabinet-making and coach-making trades ; and, secondly, from the fact that while in practice a large proportion, perhaps 50 per cent., of aircraft workers were remune-rated by systems of output bonus-considered necessary in order to stimulate output to the utmost in this vital branch of manufacture the unions principally concerned, notably the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, were definitely opposed to payment by results. The anomalous position of the industry, partly independent and partly dependent, and the antagonism occasioned, not only between employers and workers but between workers and their unions, by the controversy on wage methods were responsible for a most complicated and dangerous position.  &apos;The Minister of Munitions last August appointed a committee to consider the system of remuneration and conditions of employment of aircraft woodworkers. It consisted of one representative of the Ministry, two representatives of the Air Board, two representatives of the woodworkers&apos; trade unions and an independent chairman (Sir William Robinson) nominated by the Minister of Labour. Two representatives of employers were added a few days later. The findings of the committee in favour of payment by results, a standard district rate, standard working rales and conditions, and a 53-hour week, was received with serious objections by the Engineering Employers&apos;- Federation. These employers were opposed to the 53-hour week and the proposed working rules and conditions as calculated to introduce confused practice into engineering establishments. The workers, on the other hand, consulted by ballot on the question of payment by results, voted against it by two to one. The result of this ballot was communicated to the Minister on the 22nd October by a deputation from the National&apos;Woodworkers Aircraft Committee. At this conference Mr. Churchill, while accepting the ballot, expressed his anxiety that there should be no interferenceU   (33)5107   Pk 20   125   2/18   E&amp;S A
with existing systems of payment By results and his desire in the interest of output to extend such systems where they were fair in their terms and were acceptable to the men. On the other hand, he was prepared to consider favourably the fixing of standard time-rates, and of working conditions. On their side, the representatives of the workers undertook not to interfere with existing methods of payment and to address meetings of workmen for the purpose of impressing upon them the necessity to speed up production.Subject to undertakings mutually given on these points, an agreement was subsequently arrived at on the 30th October, 1917 -at a time when a serious crisis existed in the London aircraft industry between the Ministry of Munitions and the National Woodworkers Aircraft Committee. The agreement provided that skilled male woodworkers should receive as a minimum the standard rate paid in each district to cabinet makers, coach makers, or house carpenters and joiners, whichever should be the highest on the 1st November, with a minimum of Is. per hour. It also provided a maximum working week of 53 hours and standard allowances for overtime, night shift.. Sunday, and holiday work. It was stipulated that aircraft woodworkers were in future to have advances settled on a separate application, and were not to come under awards applicable to the engineering industry. The question of payment. by results remained subject to the undertakings of the conference already given.The conclusion of this agreement closed a strike which, both in itself and in the special circumstances at the time, was of a most menacing description, and the men returned to work.The employers, however, developed their objections to the terms arrived at. They pointed out that the practical effect of the agreement was to base the new industry not on engineering trade conditions, but on building trade conditions. In other parts of the country, if not in London, much aircraft work is done in engineering establishments, side by side with general engineering or shipbuilding work, and the new arrangement would provide different conditions for men in the same establish-rnent, according to the work on which they happened to be engaged. The employers were specially aggrieved by the men&apos;s absolute rejection of payment by results the system which it was the original object of the joint committee of August 1917 to establish. Their attitude resulted for the time being in a deadlock, which continued until the end of January, when a widespread strike was threatened. A revised agreement was then arrived at with the National Woodworkers Aircraft Committee, and an order based on the agreement was issued the same day (8th February). Under this final agreement the employers accepted a 53-hour week, time worked thereafter to be paid as overtime at specified rates. On the other hand, it was provided that no interference of this character should be made with existing arrangements in any engineering establishments recognised as such before August, 1911. Further, it was agreed not to interfere with existing overtime arrangements that were more favourable in certain districts than those provided by the agreement. The order does not apply to shipbuilding or ship-repairing establishments.II. TRADE DISPUTES. Conciliation in the Iron Ore Mining Industry.The Ministry of Munitions have appointed a Controller of Mines for Cumberland and Lancashire (Mr. Anderson). A Joint Board has also been established to deal with difficulties locally. On this Board the Ministry have two representatives, the employers three, and the men five.Strikes in Progress on the 12th February, 1918.As regards strikes, the position has rarely been better. Only one strike  involving 300 glassworkers was reported to the Ministry as in progress on the 12th February. No serious strike has originated during the week, and the two serious stoppages of the previous week have both been brought to an end. The menace of a general strike of aircraft woodworkers was averted by the agreement and Order of the 8th February.Strike Statistics for Week Ending 6th February, 1918.i The number of workpeople reported by&apos; chief investigation officers fco have been involved in strikes during the week ending the 6th February was 9,275, as against
10,461 - in tbe-preeeding week. The-number of people still on strike at the end of -the week was 2,325. The number of working days lost during the!week was-33,169, as -against 47,701. in the previous week.The largest number of days lost in any area was 20,350 in Scotland, where a stoppage at-Messrs. :Barr &amp; Stroud&apos;s (Glasgow), involving 2,700 men/lasted throughout the week, and another at Messrs. W. Beardmore&apos;s (Parkhead, Glasgow), -involved 1,500 men from-Sundav, the 3rd February, onwards.Unofficial Workers&apos; Committees and Recent Disputes.A feature common to the two important stoppages in Glasgow last week has been, the attempt of emergency committees of workers to assume the conduct of the dispute on the side of the workers.   Another common feature is that the stoppage has been, at least at one stage, rather a lock-out than a strike.The.dispute at the works of Messrs. Barr and Stroud, Ltd, related to the method to be followed in calculating wages pending arbitration as to the substitution of time rates for a premium bonus system. The men resorted to a stay-in strike on the 26th January; the management replied by closing the works on the 28th for repairs to machinery. The difficulties of negotiating a settlement were complicated by the claims of a &quot; Works Industrial Committee &quot; to act for the men. Officers of the Ministry succeeded in avoiding the question of formal recognition of this committee by the management, and brought about a resumption of work on the 7th February.At ithe Parkhead Works of Messrs. W. Beardmore &amp; Co., Ltd., the occasion of the dispute was the terms under which the 121- Per cent, advance should be applied to workers whose wages follow not engineering or moulding, but iron and steel trade rates. Some workers, not highly skilled but engaged in operations essential for the supply.of power to other workers, became so distrustful of their trade union officials and qf constitutional action that they formed a mew union, &quot; The Steam, Hydraulic and Enginemen&apos;s Society.&quot; This body and an emergency committee of which the new union formed the core -on the 1st February threatened an overtime strike. The firm, by arrangement (it is understood) with recognised trade union officials, closed down their furnaces on the 2nd February, throwing 1,500 men idle. The opposition, however, proved stronger than bad been anticipated, and the strike leaders gained, instead of losing, strength. As the result of the interdependence of various depart-ments of the works, 4,500 additional men were thrown idle on the 8th February. Officers of the Ministry negotiated with the unofficial strike leaders as&apos;&quot; workmen In &quot; a controlled establishment who had a definite grievance,&quot; convinced them on the 9th February that the settlement effected through constitutional channels would meet their legitimate claims, and secured a resumption of work on the 11th February.Short strikes of &quot; pivotal&quot; workers are one of the methods of harassing employers advocated by class-war extremists, such as the members of the Industrial Workers of the World. They must have derived much encouragement in such a policy from a recent decision by Sheriff Fyfe, which held the employers &quot;liable in payment of a u week&apos;s wages to each of 150 ironmoulders, who, when they returned after the New &quot; Year holidavs, did not get a start for&apos; a week, because during the holidays a dispute &quot; had arisen with the Millmems Onion and, till this was settled, gas was not available *&apos; to enable the ironmoulde-rs to start work.&quot;*Another instance of successful dealing with a rank-and-file organisation is reported by the Birmingham chief investigation officer. Piece-workers in the engineering trade at Smethwick have made a claim for the 121 i)er cent, instead of the 7g- per cent, bonus, and their demand is backed by the unofficial Smethwick Workers&apos; Committee. On the 23rd January the men resolved to hand in strike notices on the 2nd February, but they have now been induced to suspend the notices for a fortnight and an arbitration is being arranged through the constitutional trade union channels. The union representatives have been invited to confer with the Workers&apos; Committee on the, subject of the arbitration.Statistical Retrospect.The number of workpeople on munitions work other than- those in Admiralty firms who were involved in strikes reported to this Ministry by the chief investigation officers during January amounted to 54,446, while the total number ofworking days lost was 250,039 (out of a total of 67,600,000), or an average of 4&apos;6 per head of those.* Glasgow Herald^ 6t.h February. Decision in a similar case in Belfast has been held over for a fortnight.   (^Belfast Evening Telegraph, 5th February.) ;tj   5107 a 2
on strike. The total number of workpeople involved was low compared with that in December; .on the other hand, the number of days lost was greater.The most important reductions in working hours owing to stoppages of work were caused by.the strike of steel workers at Sheffield, of workers in the nut and bolt trade at Darlaston, and among the engineers of the Great Central Railway-at Gorton and Dukinfield.The following table shows for January the number of persons involved in strikes and the total number of working days lost: -&apos; ,-;                  District. .	No. of Workpeople	No. of Days lost	involved.	in January.	7,119	19,283	1,528	2,812	9,489	41,023Yorkshire and East Midlands       -      -      -      -      -      -	14,212	63,725	7,833	29.853Wales -      -      -      -      -      -      -      -      -	2,900	45,500	821	7,853	10,544	39,990Total for all districts        -	54,446	250,039The reduction owing to strikes in the total number of days which might have been worked during January in firms other than Admiralty firms engaged on munition work is estimated to have amounted to only 0&apos;37 per cent. In the following table figures are given showing the total number of days which might have been worked and the percentage of those days which were lost through strikes reported by chief investiga-tion officers. For purposes of comparison, corresponding figures are also shown for each of the preceding six months : -Month.

Some indication of the problems with which the Ministry has very recently been confronted in connection with food supplies is afforded by the following illustrations : 1. labour unrest. For some weeks past officers of the Ministry throughout the country have given a prominent place in their reports to food shortage and the queue system as causes of unrest. Protest demonstrations have become frequent, and in some places have taken the form of one-day strikes.2. war munition volunteers. The difficulty of obtaining food for War Munition Volunteers on their transfer to a new district has proved so great that landladies have refused e.g, at Manchester and at Coventry to accept them as lodgers. In some cases it has been found necessary to re-transfer the Volunteers to their former employment. If this is to be avoided, it will be necessary to make some working arrangement for such cases with the Local Food Control Committees.3. timekeeping- Food queues have also been held responsible for much loss of time by munition workers.   At one establishment a workers&apos; committee,
IV.-RECRUITING.The attitude of workers in the munitions trades to the Man Power Bill is less menacing to output than was the case a fortnight ago. At Woolwich a resolution has been carried that the engineers must await the decision of the miners, who are taking a ballot on the subject. On the Clyde, the body&quot;:;:&quot; which issued the first ultimatum to the Government on the 13th January demanding the withdrawal of the Man Power Bill before the end of January, has now postponed any action until after the Allied Labour Conference on the 20th February. The important question of the official attitude of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers remains unsettled, but returns to the ballot of the members are due this week, and the isolation of the society from other unions has been emphasized by a conference on the 8th February to which all the unions concerned in the Man Power proposals were invited, and which the Amalgamated Society of Engineers failed to attend.Meanwhile, an example of successful co-operation between employers and work-people for the release of men for the Army is afforded by an agreement, concluded at the Ministry of Munitions on the 30th January, affecting workmen in the iron and steel trades.The scheme of recruiting agreed upon is to be under the supervision of 11 district committees, composed of representatives of employers and workmen with a chairman appointed by the Ministry of Munitions. The Ministry will fix the number of men required from each district, and the munitions area dilution officer will intimate to each firm the quota which it is expected to supply. Employers dis-satisfied with the assessment made upon them may appeal to the district committee, whose decision will be final. In each district a list of all the men recruitable under the Schedule of Protected Occupations and passed as Grade I. after medical examina-tion, will be sent to the committee and to each establishment concerned with a note by the dilution officer of the particular men suggested by him for release. The employers and the trade unions may make representations to the district committee against the dilution officers list, and the committee will give the final decision.The Ministry of Munitions, at the request of the employers&apos; and workmen&apos;s representatives, undertook to see that the men, whose work exposes them to extreme heat, were not subjected to undue risks from exposure while undergoing medical examination.V.-WELFARE AT COVENTRY.Out of the Central Girls&apos; Club established at Coventry at the instance of the Welfare and Health Section of the Ministry there has been developed a plan of a much more ambitious centre for popular recreation-a &quot; People&apos;s Palace&quot; on the model of those in East London, Glasgow, and Middlesbrough equipped with lecture rooms, concert hall, and gymnasium. An officer of the Welfare Section is discussing the subject with the local committee. The project has the support of the employers, workers and civic authorities.* The District Committee of the Engineering and Shipbuilding TrSdes Federation.......when consenting to&quot; assist in dealing with&apos;cases of bad timekeeping, stipulated:&apos;that the local officer of the Ministry should report specially &quot;that the food&apos;&apos; shortage is likely to be responsible for a lot of lost time.&quot;   Another officer, after addressing a meeting of workers, &quot; was literally bombarded with questions arising out of the food question,&quot; and was told &quot;that it was useless to expect&apos; &quot; them to keep good time if they and their wives had to stand long hours in &quot; queues.&quot; :. 4. Munition Works Canteens.-The Welfare and Health Section of the&apos; Ministry is conducting a special inquiry in the London area into the means at the disposal of munition &quot;workers for procuring food. Investigations are being made as to the accommodation provided by works canteens, the difficulties they experience in catering for employees, and the other accommodation (restaurants and eating-houses) in the neighbourhood of such works. The section has also been conferring informally with officials of the Food Ministry, with a view to the systematic collection of vegetables and&apos; fruit for munition canteens.
