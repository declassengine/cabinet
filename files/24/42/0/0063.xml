Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information, COT/005.SECRET.WEEKLY   REPORT   OK   DENMARK, V. (Feb. 18th, 1918)The election campaign opened.in Denmark on the 10th instant by the Prime Minister, Iff. Zafcle, who delivered a long&quot; speech in the    , -course of which&quot; he mentioned, that the Social-Democrats all over the world including those in Neutral countries were carrying on a policy which could be defined in two words viz. a peace policy.     Further -that the international reputation of Denmark had been Comoromised by false accusations against the Danish Social-Demooraoy, to the effect that its political attitude had been influenced by privileges obtained from Germany with regard to 6oal i*&quot;norts.   (see Denmark Memorandum Feb. 4th)He took exception to an article which appeared in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as misleading in regard to this coal deal, but which in regard to the action of Scheidermann, the German Socialist organiser,, might, he said, stand.     The importation of ooal from Germany, carried with it, he said, no obligations.     In reviewing the history of the case IL Sahlo stated that in 1916 Giheat Britain, mm obliged to cut down her coal exports to Denmark by tl*o-thirds.     This fact made it oossible for Germany to gain a footing in the Danish coal market, hawing an interest in supplying the coal, uQ it was to her advantage to pay for goods imported from  Denmark to the fullest possible ex-tent.in goods, and not in money.     The wish oi the Socialists to orocure coal for the rorking classes wae met by Germany&apos;s cnxiety to have&quot;her coal sold and distributed in the country.     At first, !r. &quot;jhle said, the business was not lucrative but later the State inorder to build uo their coal reserve, in view of the unrestricted
- 2 -submarine war, purchased their supplies from the &quot;&quot;orkmex^* ?uel Co.&quot;, rhich ptssibly after overcoming- great difficulties, hcd mode a good profit on account oi the considerable imports, and the in-creasing prices for co 1.I&apos;. !Iahle, presumably v/ith a ouroose, missed the point if the charges against the &quot;Worker^ Fuel COY &apos; and the Socialist oart:.*, ^hich were (1) that the whole scheme had been invented b?; Scheider-mann, and was carried oat by his Agent Helohand alirs ^arvus; (2) that there were no &quot;conditions&quot;, but that the profits, said to have been  350,000 in the first year&apos;s working, were to be soent in a Socialist prooagandcI-:, Zrhle oontinued, stating that aocusations of breaches of Neutrality on &quot;the part of the Socialist party in Denmark was born of part:; fanaticismin the statement made at the time to the Danish press ii was expressly mentioned that no &quot;conditions&quot; for the supply of coal had been made to Denmar,.,. but that &quot;con-ditions &apos; had been offered to Norway, ana refused.A curious out-cone of the oo$l deal with the &quot;V/ori:ers* Fuel Co. &apos; and the profits that hrve been made, is the fact th^t the Bonn of Directors of this Co. ive. Messrs. Helohond, Sohlarz, Fttrsten-berg, alias Cenecki etc* hr-.d decided to make s free gift to every umemoloyed workman in Co -enhapen and suburbs of fire-^ood to the value of  S, provided he had ieen without work for 30 days and ^as the supporter of a family or of relations.   This gift to the um-employed will oost the &quot;Fuel Co&quot;, about  330.000, and will probably gain many adherents to the Socialist oerty.It is.stated that Danish Banks have decided to omit the rouble from the offioiol list of quotations on the Copenhagen Exchange. The cause of this action is a message from the Eussian State Bank, stating that it only acknowledged claims b  *local&apos; pfcrsois, ^hieh is looked upon us a partial repudiation of the Debt.
vUndrr. the new Constitution whereby women will vote for the first time a general election will take place on the  2nd of Aoril, ond the Prime Minister announced in the &quot;Politiken&quot; of January 10, -the probability of an alliance between Radioals and Socialists during the -eleotion campaign, which means that the Radioals must rely more and more on the support of the Socialists, in view of which the recent revelations, of the connection   between the Danish and German Social-Democrats should not be lost sight of.The growing state of unemployment in Copenhagen caused by the lack of raw material, has formed a good basis for &quot;Syndicalist&quot; agitation.     Serious riots took: place and the Exchange was stormed by the orowd, who did considerable damage.     The Treasury and other Government buildings were also invaded without however any material demage being done.   It is perhaps difficult to explain exactly what is meant by the term &quot;Syndicalist&quot; agitation, but it would appear to be an agitation on the nart of an extreme section of the Social D^iriocrats, the latter advocating state proprietorship, and the former, government by the &quot;Syndicates&quot; of the different Trades, which theories and aims bring the two factions into ooposition one with the other.The Bolshevik Charge d1Affaires, !&apos;. Corine, who has arrived in Constantinople, stated that the Dowager Smoress of Russia-, will arrive shortly in Denmark, :nd will remain there permanently.
