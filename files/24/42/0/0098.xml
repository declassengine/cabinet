nt is the Property^ Crfothii DoeuyfleSOHMAIff OP BMOKAUB 3FQRMAIIOH310Feb.lBth - 2lBt 1918.SI. Bi^GMrte^^Exports from the United States to Greece and theNorthern Neutrals will henceforth only require to be covered by United States export licences and no farther letters of assurance will be issued by the British authorities.     United States export licences will not be granted by the United States War Trade Board until the views of H.M. Government have been obtained, and the Board will in no case issue a licence when the authorities in London unanimously disapprove.   The new joint scheme of control already applies to all shipments pro-ceeding to Greece and Iceland and to such special shipments as are allowed to proceed to the Northern Neutrals notwithstand-ing the general embargo.   The guarantees of such neutral associations as the N.Q.T. will continue to be required as hitherto and all the existing neutral organisations for the control of imports into neutral countries will be left, as far as possible, intact.We are carrying out at once our proposals, noted last week, for relaxing the general embargo in favour of certain goods imported into Sweden and Holland.8, RUSSIA.     Our Embassy at Petrograd is informed, contrary to a report which we noted in a previous summary, that the Bolshevik Gov-ernment do not intend officially to sanction trade with the Central Empires.     Foodstuffs are undoubtedly being sent across the Eastern frontiers in return for German supplies of boots and clothes;   but this traffic does not appear to be very considerable.     Prices have fallen in Constantinople as a result of the opening of the Southern frontiers.   The Turks and Bulgarians confidently expect to secure large quantities of foodstuffs from South Russia.     For transport-ing these foodstuffs there are some forty ships of about
t2,000 tons which have been lying in South Russian ports since the beginning of the war;   but the Germans will probably require these vessels to carry Russian produce to Constanza. Our Military Mission report that quantities of grain are already being carried to Constanza from the Russian ports in the Black Sea,A Syndicate has been formed to buy up stores throughout Russia for which good offers may be expected from the Central Powers.    German, agents are openly negotiating for stores in Moscow and Petrograd.   Among the valuable supplies accessible are quantities of high speed steel and glycerine and some valn-able stocks of manganese at PotI on the Black Sea.The United States Government have officially announced that they will allow supplies of a non^military character to go for-ward to Russia from the United States.   A cargo of 10,000 tons has already been despatched.   These supplies include railway material, agricultural machinery, leather and Red Cross sup-plies.    We are representing to the United States Government  &apos; that these imports will undoubtedly assist the enemy $0 obtain supplies from Russia and that exports to Russia should be at least as carefully watched as exports to any of the bor-der neutrals.HORWAY.      She Norwegians are not satisfied with the United StatesWar Trade Board1s generous proposals for an economic agreement which we noted last week.     They desire to export to Germany 10,000 tons of Galcium Carbide instead of 8,000 tons and 2,000 tons of Perro-Silieon instead of 1,000 tons.     They also claim that the 40,000 tons of iron ore and the 1,000 tons of zinc to be annually exported to Germany shall be ex-elusive of any further quantities with which they may desire to supply the Central Empires in exchange for German iron and steel and raw zincThe Norwegian Government have prohibited the export from
Norway of all fish and fish products, including tinned fish, except under licence.   No licences will he granted for the export of liver, blubber, fish oil, fish meal, liver meal, guano or roes, or for any canned goods produced with the aid of milk, cream or fats of Norwegian origin.   Other classes of fish and fish products will be licensed for export provided It can be shown that their export is not contrary to any guar-antees which have been given by the manufacturers, earners or fishermen in respect of any of the commodities necessary to their industry.DENMARK.     ^fte Danes have replied to the proposals for an economic agreement which the United States War Trade Board presented in January.     Their suggestions are distinctly more acceptable than any previously submitted (vide Summary Jan.11th to 17th). They offer to limit their exports to Germany of bacon, butter, eggs, cheese and fats to 700 tons per week and to send, the balance of their dairy produce to the United Kingdom if payment can be made at current export prices.   They will limit their exports of &quot;cattle to Germany to 6,000 head per week and of hor-ses to 15,000 head for a period of six months after the Agreeme: is signed.     They will prohibit altogether the export of hides Germany and restrict their exports of fish to 25,000 tons per annum.     In return for these concessions the Danes require sup-plies of Chile saltpetre, tanning materials, heavy hides and petroleum (8,000 tons).They agree to retain only 400,000 tons deadweight of shipping for their own requirements.     This leaves 430,000 tons deadweight to be divided between the United States and British shipping authorities, and is ianac cor dance with the War Trade Board*s proposals.        The Danes stipulate, ho?;ever, that none of the tonnage handed over to the United States shall be used in the danger zone (except for Relief services) or be put into
tlie ore trade.The Danes refuse to &quot;be &quot;bound by the proposed Agreement for more than six months from the date of signing.SWEDEN.   There is a strong opposition amongvthe neutrals, andparticularly on the part Of Sweden, to the application of the United States bunker regulations to ships ceded to the Allies Or hereafter to be ceded under the various proposed shipping Agreements.      The Swedes have refused outright to accept them, threatening to cancel the provisional shipping agreement just concluded with the United States and British Governments and to break off all negotiations for a general agreement if the United States Shipping authorities insist.     The United States War Trade Board have accordingly stated that they will not apply these regulations to ships trading In accordance with Agreements to which the United States Government are a party.   This should satisfactorily dispose of the Swedish difficulty^NETHERLANDS.     The Dutch Government are apparently discussing with the German Government certain features of the proposed Allied Dutch General Agreement.     Sir w. Tovmley is informed that the German Government strongly object to our shipping proposals and that they have threatened to blockade the Dutch coast unless they receive an undertaking that Dutch vessels leaving Dutch ports for the United States will return to Holland.   The attitude of the German Government is believed to be inspired by the German Admir-alty and to be contrary to the advice of the German Minister at the Hague.SOUTH AMERICA.     ^he United States Government hope shortly to secure the enemy ships in Uruguay, Chile and Peru.   H.M. Government have been treating with the Government of Uruguay for the ships in Uruguayan ports since October last;   but have decided to retire in favour of the United States.    We shall continue our negotiations for the ships in Ohile with the Ohilean Government
59.Trade Intelli-iice Department. 22nd February,1918as the United States Government are in this case negotiating with the German interests concerned, and experience shows that such negotiations are rarely successful.    We are warning the United States Government that the German Government have in the past only sanctioned such negotiations in order to gain time and to obtain information of the intentions of the Allies.   The Peruvian Government have given the United States Government to understand that they are willing to cede the enemy ships in Peru for employ-ment in Allied services provided they are secured against reprisals from the Central Empires.&apos; UNITED STATES.   Owing to transport difficulties the United States Government have been obliged to introduce further measures for controlling imports and exports.     On Feb. 16th they published an Order prohibiting except under licence all experts from the U.S.A. to neutral countries and all imports whatsoever whether from Allied or neutral sources.   They have further decided to grant no export licences for goods ordered by the Allied Govern-ments or by Allied firms or persons unless the orders have previous-ly been sanctioned by the United States Purchasing Commission.   This will prevent orders from being accepted for goods which cannot pos*-sibly be shipped.   The Purchasing Commission will only accept for consideration orders received through the several Allied War Missions.GERMAN SUBMARINE BLOCKADE-   The following is a summary of the lossesto merchant shipping due to enemy activity, which were reportedin the period Feb.15th to Elst inclusive.
