a &amp;[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys1 Government.]32233Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1918.SECRET.\NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION No. 39.4?jWeek ended 16th February, 1918,NAVAL OPERATIONS.Mines have, been laid in the, Heligoland Bight.A deep minefield has been laid in the approach to the Baltic.North Sea.Baltic.area.On February 16th R.N.A.S. machines from Dunkirk carried out a bombing raid Manders on Zuydwege Dump, and over 1,800 lbs. of bombs were dropped, causing a fire in the middle of the dump.   Dunkirk machines have also carried out several patrols and reconnaissances.On February 15th, at about 1 a.m., the enemy, with a flotilla of at least five destroyers, Dover made a raid on our patrol forces in the Dover Straits while they were hunting a submarine. Straits. Our casualties were 86 killed and 19 wounded, and one trawler and seven drifters sunk.On February 15th-16th, about midnight, an enemy submarine fired about 30 shells of small calibre into the town of Dover. Our destroyer patrols saw the flashes, but the enemy had disappeared before the spot could be reached.On February 8th and 12th aerial reconnaissances of Constantinople were carried out Mediter-and &quot; Goeben &quot; was seen to be in Stenia Bay alongside a jetty ; her trim appeared normal ranean. and no cofferdam or temporary patching was visible. On February 12th her fires were alight, as smoke was seen issuing from both funnels, and a considerable quantity of stores was on the wharf alongside. No anti-aircraft fire was experienced from &quot; Goeben &quot; or from several positions which are known to be armed with anti-aircraft guns, nor were hostile aircraft seen.NOn February 11th the Special Service Ship &quot; Cullist&quot; was torpedoed 15 miles east Casualties of Drogheda, 43 of the crew being lost.On February 12th &apos;the Mine Carrier &quot; Eleanor No. I,&quot; which was taking mines to the Mediterranean, was torpedoed off St. Catherines, 35 officers and men being lost.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week 19 to 23 large enemy submarines have been located, 6 of them&apos;being Submarines vessels of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type.   Of the latter, 2 were operating about operating. 100 miles south-west of Cape St. Vincent, and 2 in the vicinity of the Canary Islands.   The areas of greatest activity during the week were in the English Channel and off the East Coast.The measures which have been taken to deny the Dover Straits to enemy submarines are increasingly successful, and are evidently causing the enemy considerable uneasiness. An unusually large number of submarines have this week been reported to be on passage from the Kattegat to the Fair Island Channel between Orkney and Shetland, so that apparently the enemy is being forced to take the route round the north of Scotland.(C 975)  Wt.   55  2/18  h&amp;S

It will be noticed that, in consequence of such reports, the figures of losses for the previous week have been substantially increased, two large British vessels, aggregating over 17,000 tons, and four Allied and Neutral vessels having been added.Losses of British steamships in trades.The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of losses by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British Merchant Steam-ships of over 500 tons gross register ; and the table in Appendix II shows by trades.as regards suoh ships the percentage of tonnage sunk by enemy action to tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last four weeks.
Areas in which -vessels lost.The percentage of losses to sailings this week. as.regards British tonnage employed in overseas trades, is only 1.14 as against 3.88 last week, but as regards Coastal and Cross-Channel traffic the percentage is .36 as against .18 last week, while the total percentage of losses to sailings as regards all United Kingdom trades is .69 as against 1.58 the previous week. The improvement in the percentage figures is due, not only to a considerable reduction in losses in all trades except the coasting trade, but also to a notable increase in the total British tonnage afloat during the week. This increase is spread over all United Kingdom trades, and the aggregate tonnage engaged in those trades is more than 20 per cent, in excess of the corresponding figure for the previous week.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British Merchant Vessels sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine classified according to areas.There has been a considerable increase of enemy activity in the English Channel and some increase in the North Sea, but on the other hand only one small vessel has been lost during the week in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel area in which last week there were heavy losses.ENEMY MINES.The week under review has been unusually quiet as regards minelaying activity on Minelaying. the part of the enemy.   The reduced activity which has been noticeable of late is possibly accounted for by a shortage of minelaying submarines or of mines, but as the few that are laid are now very widely scattered and laid farther from shore than hitherto, our mine-sweepers are kept fully employed.Mines have been laid during the week in the Cromarty, Harwich, Nore and Dover areas.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British vessels Casualfcies-sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks: Week Ended.

- -  -  - --------Defensive During the week 27 Merchant Vessels were fitted to take primary armament and 30armament.  Merchant Vessels to take supplementary armament.The number of Howitzers and Bomb Throwers delivered to date is 704.Mine pro- 1,299 Merchant Vessels, have been fitted with Otter equipment, and the Warshipstectiongear. fitted with Paravane equipment now number 350.Aircraft.The anti-submarine operations carried out by the Royal Naval Air Service have now been examined for the last seven months of 1917, during which period the total distance flown in such operations by aircraft, excluding kite balloons, was 935,936 miles, and the number of submarines sighted was 132. The monthly average number of escorts per-formed by aircraft during the period was 69.5 by aeroplane and 55.7 by airship, and the value &apos;oi this escort work is demonstrated by the fact that up to the 19th December no ship under aircraft escort had even been attacked by submarine. Two ships under airship escort, which were sunk at the end of December, were just leaving port and the convoy had not formed up.During the period the monthly average number of submarines sighted by aircraft was 19.4 and of submarines attacked by aircraft was 12. Submarines have been sighted by aeroplane and airship at a distance of 10 miles and by kite balloon at a distance of 28 miles, whereas the accepted maximum distance at which submarines can be sighted from ships is only 7 miles.There are nineteen known instances where attacks on vessels and convoys have been prevented through the activity of British aircraft. Also on numerous occasions mines have been sighted by aircraft and information given which has led to their destruction.MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.Merchant- 1 Seven enemy merchant ships have this week arrived at, and four have sailed from, men.        Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat.   None have entered or left Rotterdam.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. France.The policy of converting a number of their submarines into Minelayers has been abandoned by the French, owing it is believed, to the fact that their depth-keeping qualities are impaired by the alteration. Only two submarines were thus converted but a new large submarine for minelaying only is being laid down.Russia.The powers of the Governor General of Archangel have been relegated to an Executive Committee of twenty-five, the majority of whoin are Bolshevists-, but the Governor General, who is strongly pro-British, is to remain as a member of the Committee.Admiral Ketlinsky, the Russian S.N.O., Murmansk, was murdered onFebruary 10th.There is no alteration in the situation in the Baltic or Black Sea, but a report has been received that German troops are being concentrated in Baltic ports for use in Finland.A decree has been issued disbanding the Fleet and reorganising what is described as the Socialistic Workmen&apos;s and Peasants&apos; Navy. An order has been issued to the Fleet stopping all defensive works and all other work in the Ministry of Marine and in the naval ports.
Austria.On February 2nd a peaceful mutiny took place at Cattaro in most of the ships and in the barracks, the mutineers demanding peace and better conditions, and an Admiral and several officers were locked up. The intention appears to have been to take out some of the ships and surrender them to the Italians at Brindisi, as in the case of the Austrian T.B. No. 11, which surrendered at Ancona last October. The mutiny is reported to have been particularly bad in the cruiser &quot; Sankt Georg,&quot; but the German element in the crew of the &quot; Novara &quot; and of another ship, disassociated themselves from the mutineers, and order was restored. Three battleships were sent from Pola to quell the mutiny, and these were fired upon by the coast batteries on their arrival off Cattaro.On February 3rd three Austrians landed near Barletta in a seaplane, and stated that they were the ringleaders. It would seem, therefore, that the mutiny had practically been put down by that date.It is difficult to form an opinion as to the importance of this mutiny until further details have been received, but it is interesting to note that the trouble appears to have spread to the Aviation Service and to the Fortress Artillery regiments which man the -coast batteries. Cases of mutiny in ships have occurred previously, and the cause is -always reported to have been bad food and bad treatment.Naval Staff,21 st February, 1918.[APPENDICES.
