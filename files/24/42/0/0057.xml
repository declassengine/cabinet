(Vi 209; / / // MINISTRY OF SHIPPINGTONNAGE FOR SUGARThe Food Controller^ Memorandum G.T.-3565 of the 7th of February, 1918, on the subject of tonnage for Sugar has been examined in the Ministry of Shipping.2.   The tonnage allocated for Cuba has dropped behind its date but the total allocations already made for January/March loading now amount to 212,000 tons.3c   The position, so far as it can be estimated by the Ministry of Shipping is as follows : -Tons.     Weeks Supply. Sugar Commission Stocks 2nd February 183,764 -     8 l/3rdEstimated arrivals 2nd February to)    rn nnn30th March ) 1DU&apos;0UUEstimated consumption ,8 weeks&apos;        ) ^76 q00 at 22,000 tons per week )       &apos;Estimated decrease in Stocks 26,000Estimated Stock 30th March 157,764 -     7The Food Controller^ statement that stocks on the 31st of March will only suffice.for 4j- weeks would thus appear to be an under-estimate.4o The April arrivals are estimated to amount to about 150,000 tons which will cause an increase in stocks of about 50,000 tons or 2 l/3rd weeks&apos; supply.5.   The recent decision of the War Cabinet that the domestic ration is to be reduced by 6 ozs. may affect these figures materially the extent depending upon how soon the reduction is put into operation On the assumption that it will take effect from the 1st March, stocks existing on the 30 ch March amount to 8jj? weeks instead of 7 weeks1 ccLisumpt!on.     It will correspondingly reduce the shipments necessary to meet the consumption.(Sgd) J. P. MACLAY.IS February 1918.
