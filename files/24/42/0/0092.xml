A meeting of the British Sugar Beet Growers&apos;Association, Ltd. the body responsible for the acquirement of the Kelham Estate, was held on the 12th inst., at which the proposals of the Board with regard to their responsibility of management was formally accepted and approved.The first meeting of the Estate Management Committee appointed by the Board was held on the 20th inst.   The Committee settled their methods of prooedure and administration, and arranged to meet weekly until further notice. -In the meantime the work of bringing the greatest possible amount of grass land under cultivation for spring sown cereals is being actively pursued.Small Holding Colonies.   There are at present nine settlers working on the Holbeaoh Colony, and, as soon as the cottages are completed, it is hoped to provide them with land.   Meanwhile, in order to ensure the proper cultivation of the land, it is proposed to allow one of the farmhouses to be used temporarily as a hostel for the accommodation of ten to twenty women, who could be moved from this central position to work on different parts of the colony without loss of time.   Ploughing has been completed on all except one farm on which there are about 12 acres of grass land still to plough.   In order to make this field productive, a large bank is being levelled and a creek filled in.Mr. Henshaw, who has been appointed Director of the Heath Hill Colony will take up his duties on the 1st March.Pilax Production Branch.The principal work of the Branoh is still the inspection and taking of the land offered by farmers, whioh now amounts to about 10,500 acres.   3608 acres have boon definitely contracted for.Surveys have now been submitted by the Office of Works of the buildings taken over for the treatment of the crop, and arrangements are being made for their equipment. Six thousand bags of Dutch seed have been allotted to the Board by the Flax Control Board, and it is hoped that shipment of this seed from Rotterdam will commence forthwith.Tithe. Commons. Copyhold and Survey Branch.In connection with the applications made to the Board under the Law of Commons Amendment Act,        1893, for their consent to the inclosure of Tiptree Heath and Long Heath Common and Totham Plains (Essex) representations have been received from the Commons and Footpaths Preservation Society to the effect that, with a view to avoiding consider-able expense to the parties concerned, a Looal Inquiry should be dispensed with.   The matter is under consideration.
Ordnance Survey.During the week ending 20th February, 1918, 105,302 maps were sent to France and 2.623 to the Admiralty.Thirty relief models were sent to France.Commercial Control Branch.The work of the Branch during the week in addition to the enquiries as to the improvement of rural transport and extended commercial control after the war, has consisted principally of correspondence as to railway facilities for empty barrels, oil drums, agricultural machinery and ashes for drainage purposes;   shortage of sheets and trucks for conveyance of farm produce on the Great Eastern Hallway, railway charges for cattle, turnips, and acorns, enquiries of manufacturers as to present ability to supply cheese making apparatus, approval of names for margarine and correspondence on matters arising in connection with ths Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act.Fisheries Division.Administrative Section.   A Meeting of representatives of CountyCouncils interested in the Ouse and Hone Fishery District was convened by the Department in the hope that some arrangement might be made for reviving the Board of Conservators with extended po\vers.   The representatives, however3 were not disposed to take action, and the opinion was expressed that in the peculiar circumstances affecting this watershed fish conservation was best left in the hands of Riparian owners and Angling Societies.   Further^ that if the Government pressed for the constitution of a Looal Authority with a view to increasing food, supplies the expenses thereof should be a oharge on publio not local funds.   The difficulty in the case is that the Conservators would have no funds other than those they could raise by licences on freshwater fish, and the exercise of suoh a power1 would conflict with the licences now paid by fishermen to Riparian owners and Angling Societies,   The position will be carefully considered.Permit Section.   Twenty-three Permits for fishing boats have been issued, and twenty-two cancelled.   The regulations for fishing in the Dover Command have been revised, certain areas having been further restricted.   Hight fishing is, however, to be allowed for vessels of all sizes instead of being restricted to the smaller boats.   As a result of these regulations over 400 permits for night fishing have been prepared.   A complete revision of permits in the Flamborough Spurn District has been undertaken.Motor Loan Committee.   The trials of two large Lowestoft smacks of about 120 tons displacement and 80 feet long were run last week at Dartmouth and the installations proved most satisfactory. These vessels are two of a number of Lowestoft smacks which have migrated and made padstow their home port; they are also two of four which were chosen to be engined and armed for the protection of the Padstow Fleet.   So far as the Committee are aware there are no trawlers fitted with Internal Combustion Engines approaching the size of these vessels;   it will therefore be extremely interesting to watoh results and see whether the vessels will prove sufficiently successful to stimulate other owners into applying for engin.es for vessels of the same class.
Fish Pood Committee,   VTood Turnings.   A satisfactory supply for present purposes has now been furnished by the Committee to local Committees at Hull, Grimsby, Yarmouth and Lowestoft, . These local Committees are supplying the different Firms in their respective districts; large numbers of sacks have been provided oy the Committee for the purpose, on terms which should obviate any loss.Snrat Fishfofi.   The catches of Yawlings referred to in last week*s report have ceased, and are not likely to recur this season. It was not necessary to start the scheme of supplying Hospitals, etc.   Attempts, however, were made to put them on the market on the Midland Towns, but without success.   They are not suitable for eating in a fresh state, and will not be taken by Canners who have adequate supplies of Sprats. It is hoped next year to have all facilities for canning,that it may be possible to absorb any Yawlings that are landed,JSyyc,   Enquiries for Flax sewing twine for repairing sails have been received, and the Committee have obtained the necessary Permit from the Flax Controller and have obtained Twine to meet the immediate requirements.Secretary.
