His Britannic (V?ajesty&apos;s Government.)(This Document is the Property orzSECRETIntelligence Bureau Department of Information. A.GfW/039WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   GERMANE   XXXIX. (Feb. 12 1918)The end of the German Strike, the different methods by which it was dealt with in Prussia and other German States, and the politioal oonsequenoes of these events are subjects which at first sight would seem to have been eclipsed by the Peace wi,th the Ukraine and the Bolshevist Delegations singular declaration of a peace between Bolshevist Russia and GermanyIt Is hardly possible at this stage to estimate the real nature and significance of what has happened at BreBt-Litovski we have no news as yet of the Central Powers1 reply to the Bolshevist declaration of peace.    There will he general curiosity as to what they mean to do about it.    The promised &quot;complete demobilisation of the Rus8ian forces on all fronts&quot; opens avenues for wide speculation.    So far as the front against Germany and Austria is concerned the Russian forces were* for all practical1 purposes, already demobilised.    In so far as they still remained at or near the front they were either fraternising and trafficking with the enemy or plundering and ravaging the distrlots behind their positions.    It hae been significantly - &apos; stated that such soanty supplies of commodities as Germany had been able to obtain from Russia during the truce came, not from the Ukraine but from the north from Esthonia, and was the result of local trafflo through the lines.    Ukrainia produoed in peace-time one-third of all the agricultural produce of Russia, and three-fourths of the coal and iron.    But so far as the agricultural produce is concerned, it is reported firstly, that
- 2 *there is not so muoh of it as was at first believed, and secondly, that the landowners and the peasants are very reluctant to sell it even to local buyers,    they will not take money for it because mbney cannot at present purchase what they want.    They will only barter their produce for other commodities, agricultural implements, clothing, tea* etc.    How soon the Germans may he able to organize a traffic of this kind remains to he seen.    It also remains to be seen whether the Bolshevists contemplate &quot;deraobil-iaation&quot; on the internal fronts. e.g. In the spheres 6f their fperation against Finland and the Ukraine.    Continued operations against the Ukraine oould hardlfr he witnessed with passivity by Germany, as they would thwart all her plans for the a&amp;mediate establishment of commercial relations with that country. 2.    It will be very important to watoh the effects of the Peace with the Ukraine and of the Bolshevist declarations upon the masses in Germany.    The strikes were after all, as their insti-gators confessed, in the nature of a demonstration.! intended; amongst other things, to influence the Government against annex-ation and in favour of domestic reform.    For the moment they have had precisely the opposite result.    The Gflprerament in Prussia has hardened its heart and has allowed it to be sew. that the military element is in supreme control of the domestic situation. The Chief-in-Commandt in the Marks (i.e. Brandenburg and the other districts whioh were the cradle of the Prussian Monayohy), General von Kessel, took the preservation of order and the trial and punishment of disturbers of the peaoe entirely out of the hands of the Prussian Government.    He even enaoted that there should he no meeting of the leaders of the strike with each otherwwmj - w - oat mam mm m mm k. ****** a.        mm        itX It was brought out at the trial of the Minority Socialist, Dittmann, that the * demonstration&apos; strike had actually beenintended to. last only three days.
n    3   Hor v/ith the political representatives of the working-classes, the Social Democrats.    A deadlock was thus oreated for some days, during which the leaders could not efcen have ooaferred with the object cf ending the strike. The Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor (the Radical Herr vcn Payer-) the Imperial Secretary of State for the Interior and the Prussian Minister of the Interior likewise conformed to these marching orders abd refused to receive any deputation to which either strikers Or representatives of strikers &quot;belonged.    The old Governing Parties, the Conservatives and the Industrialist National Liberals felt that their prospeots were brightening.    The kational Liberals who had hitherto found it expedient to attend the meetings of the patriotic Reichstag bloo which includes the Majority Socialists (Soheidemani^s party) now assumed their old airs of superiority and absented themselves. They desire to make out that the Majority Socialists were connected with the strike, that they sympathised with it and that they ought therefore to be politically boycotted as they were before the war. It Is evident that the Conservative and the National Liberals would like to evolve a new bloc on pre-war lines.     They would Include the Catholic Centre and the Radicals, if the Radicals would join, but would exclude the Socialists.     The object is plain] it is to dispense the Government from any necessity of seeking the support of the masses and their representatives, the Socialists, by concessions in regard to the right of coalition or by the more vigorous promotion of reforms, especially the Prussian Franchise Bill.Now the influence of the strike and the method of its suppression,t- ------   -as well as the treatment of the Socialist leaders, has evidently Intensified popular discontent to a dangerous degree.    We cannot
yet know how far^Jhi/r Hfiealisg- wilX- Jfca^irocp^ontb^fe^-tom^^^-Urt it would be wise not to oount too-muohupon effects of this sort.    It seems more likely that the discontentwill simmer cn among the working^olasses and result in hal *b6artedor BoariTped work in the munition factories, sporejdlon*enewal ofstrikes and manifestations 0*f hostility to the prolongation ofthe war.    In the Reich a tag, which Ought, according to programmeto m6et on February 19th, a dismission of tfra strike and themethods by which It was suppressed is Berlin Is inevitableAnd in that corniest ion a debate oa tho relations of the Governmentwith the Higher Oo*nmnd^rLho--onar^side and with &amp;e parties inthe Reichstag on the ether is bound to-talce place.    Count Hertlingwill be exposed to the first great test ot his Chancellorship.Ho will have to make it clear whether he relies mainly upon militarymethods for the maintenance of law and order and of the &quot;wlll^to-vioT-oryy&quot; or whether he still feels the necessity which governedthe policy of Bethmanu Eollweg, the r6c60.e3.ty of keeping the sympathy -of the masses by securing the oo-operfctlon of their politicalleaders.3.    A remarkable feature of the situation is that the Governments of the South German States and Saaraay have taken a very different line from that of Prussia in dealing with the strikes.        fThe Bavarian Minister-President Herr Dandl (Count Hertllng!s successor In that post) publicly thanked the Socialists In the Chamber for having taken over the leadership of the strike in Bavaria with the object of keeping it In peaceful paths and speedily ending it.    He even went so far as to respond, with due reservations, 4.to get him to pronounce an opinion on the dilatory treatment of the Prussian Franchise Bill.    It is true that all that he said was that the promise of the King of Prussia was meant to be kept and
that there was no evidence that the Prussian Government did not intend to carry through the measure.    The noteworthy declaration was made by one of tho speakers in the Bavarian Chamber that the Prussian Franchise was now &quot;a German question&quot; and could not be trifled with.    This is a fundamental truth, as there can be no liberalising of the imperial Government until the predominant State, Prussia is liberalised.    For one thing, Prussia supplies the sole Imperial Minister, the Chancellor, and this holds good whether the Chanoellor be by birth and adoption a Prussian or a citizen of come other German State.    He must take his instraotions for Imperial Affairs from the King and Government of Prussia.The Saxon Minister 6f -the -Intericr likewise thanked a deputation of Socialist members of the Saxon Chamber for their action in oonneotion with the strike.These things are no more than symptoms-    But they ere noteworthy and may portend a firmer exerolse of non-Prussian influences in the last stage of the war.    It was likewise noteworthy that the Bavarian Minister-President explicitly contradicted a report that the King of Bavaria had taken part in a movement of the German Sovereigns to bring Influence to bear upon the Kaiser in the direction of annexationlsm.A Press organ of the Bavarian Government, (the Munich and Augsburg Abendseitunp;) subsequently stated that efforts ,had been made - doubtleas by Tirpitz and the Fatherland Party * to induce King Ludwig to take action of that, kind but that they had failed. 4.    It ought further to be noted that there has been a violent debate in the Press about the despatch of a special Bavarian envoy, Count Podevil3, to Brest-Litovsk to^r^i^sentJBavaria at the negotiations.
e   6   &quot;The wuwxationist papers have been denouncing this step as a piece of &quot;partiouXarlsm,Jf the word which is always used to eharaoteriae any manifestation of independence on the part of the Sooth German States,    T/hat is more remarkable Is that the Liberal Frankfurter Zeltunff has in mare moderate terms, aesooia/ted itself with this campaign.    The equally Liberal Munich Heueste Nachriohten has replied to the Frankfurter Zeitung and has pointed out that the despatch of Count Podevils to Brest-Litovsk is in conformity with a Convention concluded between Prussia and Bavaria on November 23, 1870 (i,e. during the Franco-Prussian War) and ratified on February 14 1871, that is to say after the proclamation of the German Eswpire (January 17, 1871) and the ratification of the Treaties of Versailles, by the Bavarian Chamber it is true that this special treaty with Bavaria is not included in the Constitution of the aspire, but its validity is secured by the fact of its being mentioned in the Law of April 16, 1871 establishing that Constitution.     (Section 2)Another matter on which BaVaria has reoently been attacked is the presence of a Bavarian representative with tie Commission which is engaged in negotiations for an eoonomio treaty with Austria-Hungary.    The Munich journal already cited is again ableAto quote ohapter and verse   for this constitutional right of Bavaria and to show that provision is made for the participation of delegates from the South German bordering States in all oases of commercial negotiatiations with Austria and with Switzerland. Both these controversies are worth noting with a view to future eventualities.X  Final Protocol of Negotiations on the Zollverein Treaty which was concluded on July 8, 1867 between the North German Bund on the one part and Bavaria, Wurtemburg, Eaden and Hesse on the other. vd Article 8, Section 8.-lttkalopsed in the Constitution of the Entire Article 40(HanJ3Iswesen)
