r CA8//vtThis Document is Jhe Property of His Britannic MajestyJs Government.)MEMORANDUM FOR THE WAR CABINET.*2 &apos;r*rWith reference to my memorandum of February 12thas to the temptations to men of the Oversea Forces on leave, I circulate to the War Cabinet the accompanying personal telegram from the   Governor-General of New Zealand.   This telegram confirms the views already expressed as to the strong feeling which this question is arousing in the Dominions, and supports the case for the immediate issue of the proposed Defence of the Realm Regulation.W.H.L.13th February, 1918COLONIAL OFFICE.
PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM:From the Governor General of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office 6.18 p.m., 10th February, 1918). Personal.I have again been asked by Minister of Defence to mention the subject of venereal disease to you under this heading.   The feeling in New Zealand is that sufficient is not being done to deal with this matter especially in large towns in United Kingdom and that sufficient measures have not been taken by His Majesty^ Government to prevent solicitation.   Can New Zealand hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will again consider question as my Government are most anxious for the welfare of the soldiers and do not think sufficient has in this respect been done for their protection by His Majesty&apos;s Government?LIVERPOOL.
