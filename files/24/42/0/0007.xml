13th February 1918.nACQUISITION OP CHILEAN BATTLESHIP nATJ ERANTS OOCKRANE&quot;.Admiralty. Memorandum for the War&apos; Cabinet.The approval of the War Cabinet is desired to the acquisition of the Battleship &quot;Alnirante Cochrane&quot; , which is now building at ElsvrLck for the Chilean Government.Should the acquisition be sanctioned, it is proposed to con-vert the vessel into a seaplane-carrier for which she is admirably adapted, as she could accommodate a large number of machines. About 9,000 tons of steel are already built in the ship, the boilers are on board, and from&apos;1,600 to 1,800 tons of additional plate would be required, for the conversion, which would take about 9 months to carry out.She would, therefore, be available as a seaplane-carrier in the autumn of this year, whereas the seaplane-carrier &quot;Hermes&quot; could not possibly be completed before the summer of 1919.   It wj.ll be seen that by adapting the &quot;Almirante Cochrane11 as proposed, the provision of a large seaplane-carrier will be expedited by at least 9 months.In the autumn of 1914, when the purchase of the &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot; (now H.LI.S. &quot;Canada&quot;) from the Chilean Government was negotiated, the possibility of our acquiring the &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; was foreshadowed.The Chilean Authorities have been approached and the Chilean Minister states that his Government are willing to transfer the ship on terms similar to those agreed in 1914 with respect to the &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot;.      He adds that his Government ask that, in consideration of their agreeing to sell the &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot;, the British Government will see their way to supply the Chilean Government with some aeroplanes (of which some at least should be up-to-date machines) during the next 12 or 18 months, and he points out that for this consideration to be of value&apos; the aeroplanes must be supplied during the war as subsequently they would be easily procurable elsewhere.     The Chilean Government do not, however, make the transfer of the &quot;Almirante- Cochrane&quot; conditional upon compliance with this request.The Admiralty propose to investigate what could be done in the direction of meeting the wishes of the Chilean Government in this respect,. bearing in mind that shortly after the &quot;^Jinirante Latorre * was&quot; acquired, 6 submarines which we had ordered in the United States were transferred to Chile at the request of the Government of that Country.The total cost of acquiring and completing the &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; would be anproidmately  3,000,000, of which about  500,000 represents the estimated cost of completing and adapting the ship as a seaplane-carrier.(Sgd)     R. L Wemyss.loth February 1918.
