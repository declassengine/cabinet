A.This 00icument is thePropei^^SUPPLY DP DOCTORS FOR THF; ARi-iY-.Me:aorandUJttj3  the Minister of National ServiceThe Army Medical Department has submitted to the Minister of National Service a demand for medical practitioners for the Array during the present year, which would necessitate the withdrawal from civilian practice of 500 doctors of military age,The number of civilian medical practitioners has been so seriously reduced in many districts,  that any demand for further withdrawals must be closely scrutinised; and the civil and military requirements can only be met by rigid economy in the distribution of medical practitioners.   In these circumstances there is no doubt that further withdrawals of medical men on the scale asked for by the Army Medical Department would lead to serious protests in Parliament, and could only be justified by proof of pressing military necessity-    I feel bound, therefore, to advise the War Cabinet that it would, not be either politic or justifiable to proceed with the arrangements necessary to meet che present demand, unless the War Office are able to shew that all possible plans have been considered end put into operation to secure the fullest use of the medical personnel of.the R.A.ILC. now at their disposal, both at home and abroad,
