Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.-MEMORANDUM ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THEX^W CAUCASUS.The study of the most recent newspapers give3 ground for regarding the immediate outlook in the Caucasus as serious, events rapidly moving in the direction indioated in our two immediately preceding Memoranda.     &quot;Even to the 0ttr^e.^si^pX^^minded&quot; (writes Mschak, the leading Armenian paper, H,i$B &apos;-Uv$* of December 26) &quot;it must be evident that Russia and s.ijp^ motfe&apos; the Caucasus is shaken to its foundations&quot;.   The grave element. is 1^at,i, as we foretold, apparently no confidence is felt in the iffiXifo/?? the present Trans-Caucasian Government to cope with&apos;the situation.   In fact, the same paper intimates that it is convinced &quot;that there is no authority to provide against the crisis and no body capable of even thinking about it&quot;.    This pessimism seems to be l^prne out in part by the fact that instead of providing means and measures to meet the approaching crisis^ the Government seems to be most busily engaged issuing decrees on the agrarian problem aid the suppression of titles. It is apparent that the Bolshevik party is growing in strength and aggressiveness and if, as is probable, they are reinforced by another 25 to 30 thousand troops returning from the front, amongst v/hom all Ideas of discipline and patriotism have disappeared,, the Caucasus maybe the scene of such chaos as characterises European Russia at present.In Northern Caucasia there seems also to be growing confusion, although the South Eastern Union is reported as strengthening Its position and extending its sphere of action.   Even there, however, the Bolshevik agitators and emissaries are hard at work to bring about confusion in order that they may seize the power.      The Bolsheviks have gained so much strength already that on December 26
their agents killed General Karaulov, the Ataman of the Terek Cossacks, along with some of his followers.   It appears that Karaulcv was returning from Piatagorsk to meet and disperse the Bolshevik troops from the front.   At one of the local stations the Military Guard simply shot him and threw his dead body out of the window. This murder of Karaulov is hound to have roused the Terek Cossacks, and this in its.turn may introduce a new element of discord &quot;between the regular forces and the South Eastern Union.Another serious danger from the South is revealed in the local-expressions of the Pan-Turanian movement.   Count Yorontsoff Daohkoff whilst Viceroy (1905-15) settled some hundred thousand Russian colonists r*n the Mughan steppe along the course, and&apos;in the hinterland, of the Lower Araxes.     New that all military protection has disappeared from the Russo-Persian frontier, wild tribes of No&quot;:&quot; tii-W e a tern Persians, fierce Turco-Tatar tribes of Shahsevans and Karadaghis are moving across the river into the Mughan steppe where they are reported as having massacred thousands of Russian peasant colonists, carried off the women and burnt down farms.    These  aids by the Shahsebans have oaused a serious panic at Baku itself, ivhere national regiments are being equipped to meet them.     It is netfl* worthy that these brigand tribesmen do not spare any of the Tatar or Persian peasants on their way;   aJJ are treated alike by Shahsevans and Karadaghis, but so f&amp;r the greatest sufferers have been the helpless Russian colonists.The effect of this wide-spread movement of the Persian tribesmen was immediately felt at Elizabetpol, on the main line between Tiflis and Baku.     In the last week of December ab-out 3.,000 Tatars from the Elizabetpol district raided several railway stations on the main line, killed the railway officials, robbed the buffets and tore up the lines;   they also cut down telegraph and telephone-Swires and destroyed all communication between Baku and Tiflis.    It was pro-posed to send Georgian and.Armenian national regiments to quell
these Tatar raids, but the Provisional Government, considering that such an action might arouse suspicion among the Tatars, decided to send mixed regiments to keep order at Elizabetpol and to repair the communications.At Tiflis itself the Provisional Government is working under many difficulties.   In almost all civil and municipal bodies the Bolsheviks as yet represent a comparatively small proportion. Nevertheless their seoret activity and strength appear to overshadow all the democratic organisations;   owing to the increasing numbers of demoralised trtfops returning from the front, this influence grov,s daily.It appears that the Petrograd Bolsheviks sent some time ago a certain Ptepan Shahoumian as their Commissioner for organising the autonomy of Turkish-Armenia.   This Armenian Bolshevik on arriving at Tiflis expressed himself as against all nationalist manifestations, national regiments, national gutonomy and so on.   In the local press he openly expressed himself against Georgian nationalism;   so he was naturally asked to leave Tiflis, the capital of Georgia. During the second conference of the representatives of the Caucasian Territorial Army Shahoumian gathered round himself 170 Bolsheviks, as against a bloc of 180 representatives of Mensheviks, Social Revolutionaries and Nationalists combined;   the conference achieved nothing practical.   Both sides accused each other of espionage under the old regime and of playing the role of agents provocateurs   at present.-  All this simply tends to strengthen the nationalist movement dmongst Armenians and Georgians, and inoreases the importance of their National Councils^ relatively to the Provisional Government.Following upon the signing of the armistice with the Turks,, whole regiments appear to have left the fron^JLndJ^rljninately. The Armenian National Council, fearing an inroad by the Turks, has been appealing to the Armenian deseirters-xLot to leave their trenches.
&apos;  t-The Georgian National Council has likewise issued a similar appeal. Thousands of Turkish-Armenians have been equipped by the Armenian Military Union and sent already to the trenches left vacant by the deserting Russian regiments.   The Armenian Teachers&apos; Union has also volunteered to send several hundreds of men and women teachers to the Erzerum and Erzingan fronts to replace the deserting troops. The Armenian press continues to express its feeling tha  the moment has arrived when Armenia is going either to be a new Armenia or the graveyard cf all Armenians. :Tho latest information from the Caucasus (dated February 14) . only oq^^nfirms the above.   The Russian troops as well as the native soldiers returning from the front are under no control and, besides the Tatars, are pillaging the country in all directions. Civil war is being waged everywhere, revolt and disorders are rife, and the Central Trans-Caucaaian -Government1 s authority is practically ncn-exietent.As we pointed out in previous-Memoranda, the National Councils are the only bodies on which any reliance can be placed.13.2.18.
