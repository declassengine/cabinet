Colonel form      IfflS -DOGUMSm IS -&apos;TBS-: ^Q2BRji 0* ELa - BRITAHfllC MAJESTY&apos;8 SOVEBNHEM^).j.367?..WAR     CABINET.Jtelations between the Board.of Tra&amp;t and/the War Trade Department in connection with the economyof Tonnage.:tomorandum &quot;by Lord Wolmer)The export prohibitions imposed by the Board of Trade and administered by the r,&apos;ar Trade Department hare hitherto been imposed for reasons of -(a). .Blockade ;(V)   Shortage of Home Supplies^It is aiitoitted that the present acute shortage of tonnage calis for a;reconsideration of policy. In April 1917 shortage of tonnage caused His Majesty&apos;s Government to control transhipmenttrade* and since then all export and import restrictions have been applied to. transhipments.-; the licensing of transhipments being administered by the ?/ar Trade Department in consultation with the Department of Import Restrictions and other Departments concerned. The experience thus gained by the War Trade Department has reveal-ed the inadequacy of present arrangements to cope with the necessity of economisingtonnage-.urgentThe first conclusion forced upon the Department Is that pro-hibitions upon export to all countries should apply to -(a) All commodities which are import prohibited.(b) Imported raw material and certain other, commoditieswhich, having been imported, have undergone no further proeess of manufacture in the UnitedKingdom,,If the tonnage situation is such that trade must be sacrificed in order to secure sufficient food and, munitions, imports must as far as necessary be reduced to the requirements of Home consumption only, and therefore goods which have been imported should not be permitted to be re-exported in their original state, save in exceptional circumstances.     The present our tonnage can be shown by the following instances..drain uponA large quantity of paper recently arrived from Canada via New York for transhipment to South Africa.   The shipment was objectionable inasmuch as tonnage from the U.S.A. is quite inadequate for the requirements of this country and it has been found impossible to transport great quantities of munitions and grain which are awaiting shipment from Africa,     further, there are facilities for direct shipment from the U.&amp;.A. to South Africa.The absonco of an export prohibition upon paper, the reasons for which are known to the Board of Trade, forced the. hand of the War Trade Department,, for if facilities had been refused and the consignment released for. consumption in the United Kingdom, there would have been nothing to prevent.its re-exportation to South Africa.    In effect the refusal of transhipment facilities
would have been fu/tile and would have meant nothing more thanthe - substitution of import and export entries for the tranship-ment entry.The Tar Trade Department was therefore obliged to grant facilities for an unde liable, transhipments.    In this connection it may be mentioned that during 1917. -2,V91,916 ewtSo of paper were &quot;imported into this country of which 25.878 owts* were re-exported while the. amount of Home manufactured paper exported 7/as 915,999 cwts *     The Board of Trade returns are not sufficient-ly detailed to ^how what waste of tonnage, if any, has been involved.Another instance may be given -A firm recently applied for a licence to re-export rubber gloves to Spain.     A licence was authorised by the RubberCommittee but it was subsequently discovered that a licence for the importation of the gloves from imerica had been granted by the Department of Import Restrictions on account of &quot;national requirements&quot; and the Rubber Committee was thereupon asked to withdraw the export authorisaticuio     But since Rubber Goods are only on List &quot;B&quot; of prohibited exports there was nothing whatever to prevent this consignment, of which the Import from America was allowed owing to &quot;national requirements&quot;, from being re-exported to Canada.About 50,000 tons of Rubber were re-exported during 1917 -that is to say 503000 tons were imported above that which was required for Rome consumption.     It would appear to be a matter for the consideration both of the War Trade Department and the Board of Trade how far this amount could in future be advantageously reduced,     But in any case there are vary strong ; reasons for strictly controlling the export of goods, which, having been imported from abroad, have undergone little or no process of manufacture in this country, and to this end many of them should be placed on List &quot;A&quot; of export prohibitions,The second conclusion which arises from the experience of this Department is the desirability of closer, co-ordination of policy between the War Trade Department and the Department of Import Restrictions.Though the Department of Import Restrictions has greatly helped the War Trade Department in supplying statistical inforiaa-tion and in other ways, yet the policy and methods of the two Departments appear to bs divergent.One elemont of difficulty in co-operation is that the classifications of the Import Prohibitions do not correspond with the classifications of the export prohibitions, e,g, &quot;hardware&quot; is import prohibited but this title comprehends a number cf articles some of which   are export prohibited and some of which are not,     Correspondence in classifications is not only essential to co-ordination of policy, but also of great importance to business firms who may have dealings with both Departments and who are greatly bewildered to find, the same commodity is dealt with by each under a different category.    It should also be noted that the practice of the Department of Import Restrictions in granting &quot;open general&quot; import licences detracts from the value of their statistical informstion to the        Trade Department, as imports imported thereunder are not included in the Department of Imporo Restrictions statistics which are sent to the War Trade Dejpartment.
Another difficulty is th*t the two Departments do not always consult the same sources for their information and are sometimes consequently acting upon contradictory data,A third   difficulty - the most important - is to be found in a fundamental difference of conception as to the principles upon which transhipments and trade generally should be controlled,  or instance the War Trade Department attempts to reduce imports by restricting exports -t but they sometimes find that the Depart-ment of Import Restrictions have given an import licence on condition that a proportion of the goods shall be re-exported. The War Trade Department are not infrequently in the dark as to the policy which has actuated the Department of Import Restrie-tions in their decisions.     If some machinery could be devised which would facilitate exchange of views it would be of great assistance.     The following eases are typical of the friction which has arisen and the waste of tonnage which has resulted.Under the Anglo Spanish Agreement His ivi$.jesty,s Government has undertaken to allow the importation into the United.Kingdom of 50 per cent of the Wine imported from Spain during 1913.   For this quantity tha Ministry of Shipping has to provide shipping facilities in spite of the fact that the tonnage available for tho importation of Spanish Iron Ore is inadequate.Recently numerous consignments of Spanish wine were shipped to the United Kingdom for transhipment to other countries.   As it would be contrary to the terms of the above mentioned agreement to count wine imported for transhipment within the 50 per cent to be imported for ooottcn^tiah  in the United Kingdom, and as the situation in regard to inward tonnage from Spain is so serious, the War Trade Department declined to grant transhipment facilities.    The polity of the Depftrtnoi;t of Import Restrictions hbwever, in controlling the import of Spanish wine is that licences should only be granted to pro-War Importers, and as in many cases the merchants interested in the transhipment applications were not pro-War importers they, could not be granted import, licences.    The Department of Import Restrictions there-fore held that their transhipment consignments could not be imported, but should be stored here in bond until after the War, or returned to Spain..     The result is. that the inward tonnage already consumed is being wasted, and more tonnage will have to be found to carry the amount of wine stipulated in the agreement.A similar position:has arisen- in regard to a large con-signment of Dutch beer intended for transhipment to Egypt.   The Egyptian Author!tios stated that;tonnage to Egypt was too short to admit of tha carriage of beer and certain othsr commodities of-which there was no urgent need-in that country, and tranship--ment facilities wera accordingly refused..   The Department of Import Restrictions feel that they cannot allow-tha beer to bo ^imported except on condition that it will be 3tored until the end of the War,     In view of the shortage of beer in this country and of the fact that the tonnage already consumad would thereby be wasted, the War Trade Department is,unwilling to agree to the consignment being raturned to Holland. .   If tha deadlock lasts for any length of tima tho beer will go bad.     Meanwhile the shortage of bear in this country is a contributory causa of industrial unrest.The War Trade Department recently asked tho Department of Import  Ssotriotionswhether they could confirm statements that certain quantities of copal gum had been Imported under their licence; the reply was that tha Department of Import Restrictions had no information and referred the War Trade Department to the Customs who could not help because copal gum is not shown separately in their returns.    Apparently the
import licences hai been granted without knowledge of the .quanti-ties actually imported under tho3e licences.The &apos;:irar Trade Department have boon trying to find out, notably in connection&quot; with celluloid, the conditions under which licences are grant 3d. because thoy have received r- large number of applications for the export of celluloid brought in under import licence and if it wero imported cn the ground that it was needed for Home recruiremontc, the T^ar &quot;Trade Department would feel justified in refusing bo allow tho re-sxport6     On tho other hand if the Import Restrictions Department are granting licences with tho full knowledge that the goods are to bo re-exported, thoy aro following a policy contrary to that of the War Trade Department who are deliberately discouraging re-exports in order to economise inward tonnage0 . - .Some time ago tho War Trade Department received 3ome very considerable applications for the export of cycle valves imported under licence from Japan^     The Department of Import Restrictions stated that tho valves had been imported for the purpose of fitting to bicycles in this country; later on the War Trade Department ascertained from the Cycle Association that there was a superfluity of valves in this country, as far more had been imported than could be fitted to bicycles hero.The War Trade Department was recently receiving at the rate of 1,000 tono per month applications to ro-export wire nails imported from America.    The information of the War Trado Dopart-* merit both from the Trado and the consuming Govornment Departments was to the offeet that the shortage of wire nailo was not acute. This information was communicated to tho Department of Import Restrictions but for some months that Department did not see its way to withdraw the open general lie en 00 v&amp;ich had &quot;boon issuod for tho importation of wire nails, since the Department of Import Restrictions app.arontly had received representations from the Trade that tha nails were urgontly required and that thoy would be used in this country.These incident^reveal a very unfortunate lack of eo-opera-tion betwoea the War Trado Department and the Department of Inj-Mport Beatrictions which have invoivod the waste of thousands of tons of shipping.It is therefore suggested that the whole question of the relations between the two Departments should be gone into with-out delay.      Indeed tho Question may be asked whether amalgama-tion is not the best solution,     Tho problem of tho maintenance of Homo supplies cannot bo   considered in watertight compart-iaents*     The same considerations ought to govorn tho policy of imports and ro-oxpor&apos;&apos;;s, they are indissolubiy connected and both impend upon tho tonnage situation.     The very persons who are tiskod for import licences might well be - the&quot; means of bringing applicants into toirx&apos; w:V&apos;.-h other firms requiring ezporb licenooa. In fact it is very difficult for any authority who is concerned only v/ith oithor imports ox exports to havo complete knowledge of the Homo supplies unuer its charge,     Tho insight gained by an sxamination of both import and export applications could not fail to assist in ascertaining the true state of affaiss cencern-ing Home supplies of any given commodity,     The problem of Home requirements confronts the Government as a wholo, yet there is io executive authority in a position to survey the wholo field it once.     The Spectacle of divergent policies, Departmental friction, and goods held up indefinitely at the docks while the obate lasts, is an unhappy one, nor could it be defended either n Parliament or in the Press.     Ho doubt the difficulties of aalgamation are great and other expedients may be devised for
:bJtter ebrrblatidn of fmi^tion betweon tha $apartment of Import Restrictions and -tie/^ar ^tErade vDopar-Gmont.., but in&apos;,Tiow of &quot;tho .acuto food a^&apos;&apos; munition crisis -which - thro a tons tho country &quot;it is submittod that tho&apos;matter &quot;is one-which&quot;requires immediate consideration.(Signed)   WOLMEK.IS. 2.
