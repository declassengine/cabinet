Bruce Log^r^o^ord Milner^British Legation, Stockholm. 4th January, 1918Dear Lord Milner,- After &amp; somewhat adventurous journey, entailing an extra twenty-four hours at sea, we arrived here safely on the 20th.     We leave to-morrow night for Tornea,     The four days spent in Stockholm, however, have been very interesting, and the interviews with Yorovsky, the Bolshevik Commissioner here, and Sir Esme Howard have been most valuable.     I think Sir Esme&apos; is one of the best and most broad-minded diplomats we have.Yorovsky is also very interesting. Ee is intellectual, of considerable&quot;&quot;culture, very clever and not at all unreasonable. It is useless for me to try to give you any statement of theas it will probably have changed long before Prom my conversation with Yorovsky, however, ay with me the conviction that recognition of Trotsky by us would be at present a serious mistake.   His position has been considerably weakened by the action of the Ukrainians, although he is certain to try to rehabilitate himself by attempt-ing an internal revolution in the Ukraire,     But the main reason for not recognising him is furnished by the accounts of Bolshevik policy which I have received from Yorovsky and Litvinoff. Yorovsky does not give the Bolsheviks more than a few months at the outside,   He admits they may fall any day end foresees 6 succession of short-lived governments for some time to come, with the eventual return to power of the CadetsRussian situation this reaches you. carryfacts.He explains the success of the Bolsheviks by Russian peasant (and soldier), who, afterT     *The70 simple all, com-j-c.^ vo * -two   ii.uuoit.ii   jjtycoau. v   v o-i^u.   ovjxu.j.cx ; ,    ,Ui w ,    sx wsi    ail,    ^ uiilposes-.80$ of the population cf Russia, looked on the revolution as the harbinger of peace.     Tho first revolutionary government promised (1) peace and (2) the land.    They then proceeded to delay the first and refer the second to the Constituent, with result that a natural disenchantment followed.   Tho Bolsheviks gave the land at once and immediately entered into noace negotia-hetions.   They thus wonthosupport of the peasants, who areBolsheviks only in so far as they desire to return home and to obtain morefLsnd. Yorovsky admits that there is no horse of the Russian peasant over adopting such socialistic extremes as theabolition of private property. Ha realises that the Russian peasant is not at heart a socialist and still less an anarchist, and that eventually he will develop into a somewhat conservative peasant proprietor.   His present psychology is simple in the extrer.
Ho is tired of fighting and wants to return home.   &amp;*ltr determination and other peace theories have really no interest for him, and he has practically no objections to anpmeasures which will give him peace.The Russian working-ran is in a different position.. Although it would be absurd to speak of him as an educated man, he is, nevertheless, better educated than the peasant,.He has been brought up on the International and on doctrines 9f class warfare, which make a strong appeal to him..   Vorov&amp;ky thinks it likely that the workmen will continue to support the Bolsheviks for some time to come.and admits that at the present moment the real force of the Bolsheviks comes almost entirely from the sailors and the workmen&apos;s guard.   Only in Petrograd and Moscow is there any real semblance of order.    In the country districts anarchy reigns supreme.   He says the Bolshevik leaders themselves realise that they will never be able to destrc totally the capitalistic structure of states.    Their real -amb,i^ tion as regards both their foreign and their internal policy is mainly destructive.    In, their foreign policy their ambition is to destroy all governments based on militarism and capitalistic imperialism and to give the world peace.   In their internal policy,  realising their reign must be a short one,  they desire to destroy as much of the old structure as possible and to carry through as many reforms as they can,  ,jO that when the inevitable reaction come3 a return to the old conditions will be impossible Vorovsky thinks that in all these connexions they have already achieved the majority of their aims,  and that Trotsky and Lenin for that reason will have a far greater place in history than anj of their contemporaries,   He considers that the defeat of militarism is already a fait accompli, in all the belligerent countries and chat self-determination in Austria, Ireland, etc., vail come by itself within a few years after peace is declared. Vorovksy himself is a purely intellectual Bolshevik,  and his explanation of Bolshevik policy is certainly worth considerationHe was very interesting on Germany and Austria, with which countries he is in close touch.   He says the Austrian labour movement is developing mosc favourably, but that the German socialists are still imbued -with the idea that the English and&apos; French Governments will invade Germany in the event of any internal disruption in Germany,   German official opinion is counting much on a labour revolution in England, but is very afraid lest revolution in Germany 3hould precede this happy event.It seems to me that our two main objects,in the war are (l) the defeat of German militarism and (2) the suppression of Bolshevism.    I think tnat unless His MajestyVs Government is absolutely sure of a. purely military victory,   they should give immediate and serious consideration to the promotion of an inter national socialist conference as the best means of attaining the two objects mentioned above.    Such a conference has three distinct advantages, . First,  it might completely detach Austria and would certainly help to. widen the gulf between the military party in Germany and the socialists.^ Secondly,  it would go far to remove any objections of the * British laoour leaders,  such as Henderson. Thomas, Smillie and even Ramsay Macdonald,  to the present war&apos;policy of the.Govern-ment.   This is, in my opinion,  a very important&quot; consideration, as I cannot help feeling that there is in England a serious danger of the more moderate labour leaders being overwhelmed - by the wave of Bolshevism and being replaced, by new leaders from amongst ^ the shop-stewards,  in much one same way as the STationS alists in Ireland have been overthrown by Sinn Fein.
Thirdly,  such a conference mil be cf^-enoxmous value in undermining Trotsky&apos;a position in   Ru&amp;sJLa.   He would then-be faced by the following alternatives; (l) either to accept the &apos; invitation and to admit the presence of the other Russian socialist parties, who would almost certainly be on our side, or (2) to refuse all partjcjpatjon in which case he would run a grave risk cf being overthrown.In short,  the object of the conference would be to streng-then the position of the moderate socialists in all countries as against militarism and Bolshevism.    The invitation would have to come from the neutral socialist committee,  and it may be taken for granted that the majority of -the neutral socialists would be on our side.You will have seen already my own telegram and Sir Esme Howard&apos;3 on this sucjeet.   I cannot help feeling that the position is very favourable to such a project at the present moment.   He would be a bold man who would say that it will be &quot;better six months hence.   It seems to me, therefore,  that if Ei3 Majesty&apos;s Government is hesitating between a peace by common understanding and a peace by military force the dedision must he taken now and will be irrevocable.    I do not for one moment imagine that an international socialist conference will give, us peace, but I do believe that such a conference will enormously strengthen our military position and weaken Germany&apos;s c orre spondin glytI think you yourself said to me that revolution was more likely to coine first in France,  Italy,  and even England,  than in Germany, because the Germans would not be afraid to use machine guns against their own people.    I think most people would agree with this, but, by providing a safety-valve for British labour in ths shape of a conference, you postpone indefinitely the need for machine-guns in the Allied countries and increase correspondingly the necessity for them in Germany. My point of vie.v may he entirely wrong, but I cannot help feeling that, wnite the German Government may be very anxious to coquet w:lt&quot;i socialist peace-doctrines because it feels sure the Allied Governments will suppress all movements in this direction,  it would.be seriously alarmed if the Allied Govern-ments were themselves to promote an international conference.I only offer these suggestions for what they are worth. I have not had time to write a despatch on the subject to the Foreign Office, but perhaps if you see fit you might care to show both the Cabinet and the Foreign Office copies of this letter.I am sending you, under separate cover, , a few German pamphlets and one or two German books on Russia, which I hope you will find interesting.My mission in Russia will be a very difficult one,  and I hope we will come out of it safely.    It will have to be all eyes and ears, I think,  and as little tongue as possible.(Sgd.)    R.H. BRUCE LOCKHART.
