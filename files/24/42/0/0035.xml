Their men were mobilised, their pro-perty requisitioned, and the dissatisfaction among tho Jews in Germany at this state of affairs was already sufficiently great in the spring of 1915 to make it neceesary fer the Turkish Ambassador at Berlin tc publish a reassuring statement.Prom this time onwards the question of Zionism was discussed in the German Press.    The idea that the Central Powers should take action to seoure Jewish sympathy was propagated, among others, by Major Jp.C.Endres - a Bavarian officer on the German General Staff, who has served in Turkey during the war and published several popu-lar books on the Bast.     Thera was also an important article in the &quot;Voasische Zeitung&quot; of August 8th 191? bjr C.\.^ratter - the German apclcgist of the Turkish atrocities in Armenia - in which it was prophesied that England would make a bid for Zionist support, and the importance of Zionism was insisted upon as a faotor either for or against Germany in the war and after it.^ The Jaffa Begprtaticns.The deportation of Jews from Jaffa, begun by Jemal Pasha afterthe British line had been advanced to the Wadi Ghuzze in the
spring of 1917, produced an outburst of indignation throughout German Jewry which the blandishments of the German Press (of all x? parties) were powerless to quel?.

There was an interpellation in the Reichstag, and the German Government found? itself obliged, for the first time to bring diplomatic pressure to bear on Constantinople.

The deportations were stopped; relief funds were sent by the Ottoman Government; the responsibility was placed on Journal&apos;s? shoulders; and it was represented at the same time that the accounts of the deportations had been grossly exaggerated, and that they were a purely military measure applied to the whole population? in the ?one of operations with no discrimation against the Jews.

The German wireless circulated this apology, and was at pains to refute the charges in detail. Particular prominence was given to an interview with the Grand Rabbi of Turkey, published in the "Frankfurter ?tung" on May 29th 1917.

Apparently neither the Jews of Germany nor the Sephardi and Donm√©? confederates of the C.U.P. were convinced of the sincerity of these explanations. But they contented themselves with the financial reparation and the assurance that the policy would be dropped.

(3) Effects of Mr. Balfour&apos;s Letter (Nov.2) and the Liberation of Jerusalem (Dec. 9)

These two events, which of course produced an enormous impression on the Jews of Russia and neutral countries, have evidently affected Jewish opinion in the Central Empires as well - where the ground had been prepared by the developments narrated above.

It is worth noting that one of the deportees was David Yellin, the organiser of the strike of Palestinian Jewish teachers against the enforced use of the German language, immediately before the war.
mm    3The German Zionist Conference of BSC. 23 -4, 1917, passed a resolution expressing its satisfaction at the British Government&apos;s action, and on Hov. 16th the German Zionist organ, the &quot;Jtidisohe Rundschau&quot;, had published an important article treating Mr. Balfour^ letter as an event of historio importance for the Jewish raoe, and showing little regard for Turoo-German susceptibilities.(4) Official Counter-measures.As early as August, 1917, the Palestinian question is said to have been discussed by von Kuhlmann and a leading German Zionist with Jemal Pasha, during the latterrs visit to Berlin;   and it is also said that Count Bernstorff took the question up in September, after his appointment as Ambassador at Constantinople.The tfffeot of Mr. Balfour*e letter upon Jews, not only in Allied and   Neutral countries, but in Germany Itself, stimulated the German Government to positive action.   The German Zionists ap-^ pear to have pressed them immediately to secure as great concessions for Zionism from Turkey as were foreshadowed in MT. Balfourfs letter. But since concessions to nationality and looality run counter to the Ottomanising, centralising programme of the C.U.P., it was difficult for the German Government to intervene till the Turkish Government had taken some step on their own aooount.After the fall of Jerusalem Hessimy Bey, Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, alluded, in an interview with a foreign journalist, to the asylum traditionally given to Jewish refugees by Turkey, complimented the Jewish immigrants on their loyalty and industry, and stated that&quot;Turkey guarantees them all civil rights1&apos;.A more important interview, given by Tala&apos;at to the Constant!-nople correspondent of the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; in the presence of the Sheikh - ul - Islam, was circulated by German wireless on January 2nd 1918.
In this interview Talalat made the&apos;fallowing points(a) Turkey has been traditionally tolerant towards her Jewish citizens.     Turkey is the only country where there has been no anti-Semetio movement;   but &quot;of course we take the stand-point that we can give Jews no privileges above our own citizens&quot;.(b) Mr. Balfour&apos;6 letter - &quot;c&apos;est une blague&quot;,(c) Any administrative restrictions hitherto placed by the Ottoman oovernment on Jewish colonisation have been due to the polioy of the Tsardom, which compelled Jewish emjPgtants from Russia to retain their Russian citizenship, with the consequence that, under the Capitulations, they remained under the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the Russian consular authorities.The abolition of the Capitulations has removed this diffioulty, but &quot;naturally it is presupposed that the J*ws who wish-to settle permanently in the country must give up their former citizenship become Ottoman subjects, and fulfil all the duties thereby entailed&quot;.(d) Immigration must keep itself within the limits of the ability of the country to support a population.     The mass-immigration of hundreds of thousands of Jews into Palestine is impossible.(e) Intellectually and spiritually, the Jews are freer under Turkish government than under any other in the world.(f) A new bill is before the Turkish Chamber Providing for ex-tensive municipal self-government for all communes of 5000 inhabit? tants and upwards.     &quot;Small Jewish communes can reckon on V.iB good-will of the Ottoman Government....... and all justifiable wishes Jof the Jews in Palestine will be able to find their fulfilment within this framework&quot;.This statement of Tala&apos;at\s was severely criticised by Mr. Jacobus EVKann, ,Chairman &quot;of Committee of the Zionist World
Organisation at the Hague, and himself an Austrian Jew by origin. Mr. Kann&apos;s points were as follows(a) The sincerity of Great Britain is proved by the previous offers of El Arish and East Africa.(b) If Palestine cannot suonort large masses of immigrants atlongpresent, that is due to/neglect, which can only be remedied by Jewish science and capital.(c) The Jews cannot put their money and enterprise into Palestine unless they receive adequate guarantees that they will be allowedto enjoy the results of it.(d) &quot;It is a matter of course that all oitigens in Palestine must enjoy equal rights, but we demand that Palestine shall again become the country of the Jews&quot;.This was not a favourable reception of Tala&apos;at&apos;8 statement from the Turoo-iGerman point of view. .  Nevertheless, that statement was evidently intended as the point of departure for a policy of oon-oiliation.    Tala!at went to Berlin a few days later, to discuss the Palestinian question there.    The results of  his consultations, as far as thay are at present known, are dealt with in Part II of this Memorandum, whioh follows.
PROPOSED   ENEMY   SCHfflB   FOR WIKHIBG   OVER   ZIONISM. The following information was received Qn Feb. 4th 1918 from a trustworthy Jewish -source at Copenhagen t-&quot;Talaat Pacha has been for, some time in Berlin discussing Zionist Polioy.    He sent for Karasso a member of the Turkish Parliament te come to Berlin and gave him full powers to deal with the Jewish question, and assurances that the Turkish and German Governments would accept the policy he recommended.2,    &quot;Last woek Karasso assembled a conference of 24 leading Jews, who, in their turn, appointed a Committee about 20 strong. (Including Dr. Paul Nathan, Dr. James Simon, Professor Ludwigetein and ProfessorOpoenheimer) to advise upon the matter.3.    &quot;The Committee recommended the formatiom of a Chartered Company, on British lines, of all Jews in Asia Minor.4.    &quot;This Company, which wilt have its heaAquartara-in Constantino-nle, will be empowered te^onfer-earton&amp;my en districts inhabited by Jews, not only in Palestine but anywhere else in the Turkish $npire. The districts thus formed will have full oontrol over their own taxa-tion, police and municipal institutions.5.    &quot;Talaat has given his approval e^f the scheme, and has promised that it will be embodied in the Peace Conditions,    In doing se he has been influenced by the out-spoken objection og the Austrian Catholics (supported, it is believed, by the Pope) to replacing either Palestihe er Syria under Turkish Government;   his object now is to win over the Jews to the side of the Turks,6.    &quot;it is feared that this proposal will create a great impression among the Jews in Europe and Asia Miner, as it promisee somethii^g which it is in the power of Turkey to grant them;   whereas the British offer is only realisable when the war is over, or at theearliest when Syria and Palestine are in our hands.&quot;
- 2 -Mg/TORTOIJM   OH   THE   PRECEEDINO   DOOGKBflg.The Jewish informant states, in this conversation, that Karasso Effendi has he an summoned by Taia**at to Berlin , and that, in con-junction with a Committee of German Jews, he has drawn up a scheme for concessions to the Zionist idea in Turkey on the Turkish Oovern-mentTs part.   Tala&apos;at, it is added, has undertaken to embody this scheme in the treaty of peace.The euwstlon ariseE whether there&apos;is any danger of this scheme diminishing the effect of 1.Er. Balfour&apos;s letter, and restoring sym-pathy for the Efeemy Governments in the Jewish World.    A review of the fact3 suggests that the trump cards are still in the hands of theAllies :-t(1) The most important Jewish Communities in the world live under the Allied Governments, or at any rate not under the Governments of th   Enemy Powers - e.g. the Jews of the United States, Great Britain, France, and Salonika.     These Jews depend on us for their future and are convinced of our good-will.The enemy Oovernmonts control the Jews of Germany, Austria ana Hungary, and the Sephardim of Constantinople, Adrianoplft aad Smyrna (less important in wealth and numbers than the sephardim of Salonika).The Jews of the Russian Pale and Rumania have partly come undsr enemy control by military occupation, but it must be remembered that (a,) many of them fled or were evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915;    (b) the Russian Revolution has changed their feelings towards Russia;   (c) the nationalism of the new Polish rfsrime in the former Vistula provinces of Russia has alienated V:*;m from the Central Powers, on whom this regime depends.
As regards the world-interests,, therefore, of Jewry as distinct from merely Zionist interests, we are in a far stronger position than the Enemy Powers.As regards Zionism, erJewish colonisation in Turkey, (a) in the first place we control the chief reservoirs of population on which the future of Sionism will depend.(b) As regards the present Jewish population actually resident within the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire, and the Jewish centres in Turkey ef historical and religious importance, the relative holdings of the Allies and the Enemy at this moment are shown in the following tableHELD   BY ^ THE ALL IES. HELD   BY   THE   ENEHY.A. Jewish Agricultural Colonies in Palestine.16 colonies along.the Jaffa-Jerusalem Railway cr South of it (about 3050 colonists and 15,627 acres)Jr 4 col-onies on the Auja line (about 2540 colonies and 5187 oares).g the Jaffa- 24 oolonies in Galilee andy cr South the Pldiri of Charon n. of0 colonists the Auja front, including4 ool- the important Atlit anda line 2iohran-Yakob.   (Vboutnies and 4515 colonists and 65,973acres - including 12,600 acres of unoolonised land east of Jordan)B. Jewish Agricultural Colonies in Anatolia.8 colonies of the Pales-tinian kind, apparently not very flourishing, (about 37,000 acres)C. Jewish Urban Centres in Palestine.Jerusalem (70,000 Jews)Nab 1 usSafed (8000 Jews)D. Jewish Populations in other provinces.Bagdad (50,000 Jews)(70,000) ) Sephardim ^Smyrna ) (of whomConstantinople(about 30,000 ) Karasso ; Adrianople ) Effendi is(17,000) ) one)Yemeni Jev/s (isolated, ill-used )
- 4 -On the war-map.ther\ the Allies control at least as important a section^ numerically, of the Jews in Turkey as the Enemy do, while the possession of Jerusalemfand Bagdad) gives us an incal-oulable advantage iri the historic-religious sphere.The Jewish informant states that the Karasso scheme &quot;promises something which it   is in the power of Turkey to grant, whereas the British offer is only realisable when the war is over, or at the earliest when Smyrna and Palestine are in our hands&quot;.This is surely fallaoious.     The only tangible basis at the moment for overtures to Zionism from either side consists in the present war-map.On the wiw-map, as has been shown, we are already in a better position with regard to the Ottoman gurko than the Turkish Govern-ment is.    But if the war-map is to be considered merely provision^ al, and the Jews ate to be influenced by foreoasts of the peace-settlemont, then is it just as uncertain whether the Turks will hold their present line and recover Jerusalem and Judaea as it is whether the British will retain these and add to them the rest of Palestine, Meanwhile, Jerusalem is our &quot;bird in the hand&quot;.3)      Finally, the Earasso scheme does not promise Jewish colonips in Turkey any wider autonomy than they have enjoyed hitherto. They already collect their own taxes, maintain their own police, and govern themselves municipally.     They do not desire more ex-tensive rights so much as greater security that their recognised rights shall be respected - and that they can never have under Turkish rule.     This truth has been impressed on them by what they have suffered from the Turkish authorities during the war.     They are eager now for a stable, equitable government, and if they ob-tained one they would probably prefer to relinquish some of their rights rather than add to them - for instance, the right of
- 5 -maintaining a looal militia, which is really a burden imprsed hy the failure of Turkish rule to keep orderj   the right it collecting their own taxes, which would be a municipal burden under any but the Turkish fiscal system;   the right of building their ewn roads, because the Turks build none.The only new feature in the scheme is the &quot;Chartered Company&quot;, and that is not a liberty but a restriction, since it would pre-sumably come between the Jewish colonists and the world-wide Jewish organisations - with their centres at Odessa, Berlin, londen, New York - by which they have been supported hlthertoe.This would subject Jewish colonisation to Ottoman ofiTieial control far more than has been the oase hithertoo.     It is a characteristic suggestion of the centralising, ottomanising policy of the C.U.P,, and as such would hardly commend itself to Jewish opinion.Altogether, the cards seem to be in our hands, and it ought toibe easy for us to disoose of the Karasso scheme by counter-propa-ganda - though we oannot afford to leave it unanswered.13. 2. 18.
