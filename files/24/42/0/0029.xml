(1)13th February, 1918.^S&amp;tf all onI beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Food Production Department for the week ended 12th February:-The Weather.Although the weather was generally unsettled, and in some counties there were heavy rains, e considerable amount of ploughing; especially of grassland, was accomplished in most parts of the country.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural,Sxecutive Committees. Cambridgeshire.   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a 120 acre farm at Dry Drayton which they have had under supervision for the last four or five months, as they have found that the occupier will do nothing towards the cultivation of his land which is very foul.     He is, however, to be left In possession of the dwelling house.Cheshire.   The Committee have found themselves compelled to take possession of several small farms in various parts of the count/y, the largest being 38,acres in extent.   These farms were inspected a year ago and found to be badly cultivated, but they have still further deteriorated in the interval and are now being let by the Committee to reliable tenants.Suffolk, East.   The Committee continue to deal with various parks In the county and have ordered the breaking up of 50 acres in Somerleyton Park, and of a portion of Little Glemham Park.
Golf Links.   In Devon the Torquay Golf Club have agreed to plou up 26 acres of their course, and to feed or mow the rest.     In Durham the Committee have, after a special Inspection, ordered the ploughing up of 50 acres of the Burnopfield Course, and in Middlesex the Committee have made arrangements with occupiers o courses at Acton, Wembley, Harrow and other places to plough up various areas.Prosecutions. In Buckinghamshire a case of some importance has been decided. Mr. Gough, the tenant of a farm belonging to All Souls College at Maids Moreton, had refused to quit after hi tenancy had been determined by the Board with the acquiesence of the College. He was prosecuted under Paragraph 3 of Regulation as recently amended, and the case was keenly contested. Finally at the suggestion of the Bench, the defendant undertook to give up possession of the farm within fourteen days* and In considers of his doing so they inflicted a fine of  10 only, but ordered him to pay  50 costs.A farmer at Skeffington in Leicestershire has been fined  50 and costs for failure to comply with a notice to break up and sow with corn 70 acres of grass land.   The Notice required the operation to be completed by 1st January, 1918. Drainage of Land.   In Cumberland the Executive Committee are enforoing the cleaning out of Bassenthwaite Beck by the Drainage Board, and of three other becks In addition to those already dealt with.     In Norfolk the Committee have Issued notices to th( occupiers of lands at Denver and Terrington to clean out their field dykes, and drains.     These are the first instances in which the exercise of the new powers for this purpose conferred by Paragraph (ee) of Regulation 2M has been reported.
Damage by Game.   Action under the Pheasants Order is reported from East Sussex and under the Rabbits Order from Somerset, Surrey and Warwickshire.Determination of Tenancies.&quot; During the week 9 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 511 acres, and 6 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 610 acres * .    .r HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. .Detailed reports have been received.of.the work under-taken by 58 out of the 43 Horticultural Representatives in boroughs and urban and rural districts of Staffordshire which afford striking evidence of the valuable work which these, honorary officers can accomplish in respect to food production in those counties in which there is a County Organisation to unify and direct their work.In Staffordshire the direction of Horticultural Organisation is under the direction of the County Education Committee, and at&apos;a conference held some months ago and attended by Sir Graham Balfour, the County Director of Education,.a representative of this Department and the Horticultural Represcn-tatiVes^ schemes of work were discussed and agreed upon, . The reports now received show that the Horticultural Representatives have been successful in assisting allotment holders in the cultivation of their allotments, and in helping to acquire more ground for cultivation.   In districts where householders have large gardens, Representatives have concentrated attention on increasing the production of food from the gardens.   They have also distributed Food Production leaflets to allotment holders, and been instrumentai in organising demonstrations and lectures on fruit preserving, bee keeping, and also in co-operating with the local authorities in the destruction of pests, arranging for the supply and delivery of manure to allotment holders, etc. Their efforts are proving&apos;most successful, not only in increasing
the number of allotments, but also in stimulating the enthusiasm the cultivators and providing them with expert assistance.The reports received demonstrate the great value of Horticultural Representatives when their efforts are directed and co-ordinated by&apos;the county organisation, and. it is hoped that counties which have hitherto not found themselves able to appoint a Central Committee, for. the guidance of Horticultural Re pre sent a-tives will take this necessary step towards the improvement of horticultural organisation.Provision of Land for Allotments.&apos; Reports received from 1,114 districts show that 246,656 applications have been made for plots under the Order, and 222*568 plots have been provided; containing a total area of 16i182 acres.During the past week&apos; the allotment Inspectors have conferred with the local authorities of 25 districts, and as the result the authorities have agreed to acquire 451 additional acre; providing 6,300 allbtments, which are not included in the number given in the previous paragraph.   At Dewsbury the area, whioh it ii proposed to take is 100 acres; providing 1,500 allotments;   at Bristol 74 acres; providing 1*036 allotments. - At Cheltenham, Yea Chesterfield, BeIper, Croydon and Middlesborough 20 or more acres are being acquired.   At fltiddlesborough, in addition to the 22 acr; which the local authorities * are acquiring, the Allotment Ihspectoi arranged with private o?mers for the-division into plots of 44 acres, providing 352 allotments of 20 poles each.- Hence, as the result of the Inspector^ visit to Middlesborough, a total of&apos;!65f acres for allotments has been obtained, and with&apos;this amount the total in the county borough will exceed 500 acres.   At Yeovil the allotment Inspector was successful in obtaining 1 acre for the Somersetshire Women1 s War&apos; Agricultural&apos;Committee for division int! &apos; 30 plots, and arranged also with the/Westland Aircraft Works for the use of- 4 acres of land adjoining the factory for the purpose of allotments.
At Selby the Inspector was able to prevent the ejectment of 13 allotment;holders who were under notice to quit.The Department have now agreed to pay  840 as compensation to the 140 plotholders in Birmingham who last autumn were dis-possessed of their plots in consequence of the necessary extension of the Birmingham Small Arms Factory.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection Of &amp;and. (1) An area of land in the Honiton District of Devon was inspected by one of the Technical Advisers at the request, of the Agricultural Executive Conwilttee, in connection with schemes for bringing into cultivation as much as possible of the high-lying land-in the district. &apos; The land in question is mostly enclosed and comparatively inaccessible from the home-steads.     The. natural poverty of the soil has probably been accentuated by. an- exhausting system Of farming, and most- of it is under poor grass, worth about I0/-i per acre.   Proper cultivation with subsequent re-seeding could not fail to improve the quality of this pasture, even If It were unnecessary to increase the production of human food,,   The existing tenants, however, are not able to deal with the land, and the local Committee feel that the cost involved is a charge which could not be made against the tenants or the owners.The Department are Considering whether, where land of this type is handed over voluntarily by&apos; the owner and tenant, It should not be cultivated by the Committee for/&quot;-say-,. 3- years, with a view both to producing as much food as possible during this period and tp bringing the soil into good condition&quot;. The Committee would be in.the position of tenants paying rent, and at the end of their occupation-the land would be restored to the owner subject to an ordinary farm valuation In accordance with &quot;local custom. A-considerable area of the;land only needs ploughing&apos; and ordinary cultivation, and all that is required&apos;&apos; immediately is a small number of, prisoner ploughmen with the necessary horses, and a few labourers.
(2)   WOlterton Park, in Norfolk, was inspected by one oft] Technical Advisers, in connection with objections raised by the owner against orders to plough which have been served in respect of four portions of the park.     The objections to ploughing are not wholly unreasonable.     The Park at present affords good sheltered grazing for a variety of Stock, and fits in well with the intensive arable practice of the district.     On the other hi a considerable body of local agricultural opinion.is in favour of the step proposed, and it is undoubtedly justifiable in the national interest.     Each of the four areas involved in the Orders was inspected.     In two cases the Inspector recommends the enforcement of the Order;    in the third, the reduction-of the scheduled area from 20 acres to 8 or 9 acres;    and in-the fourth, the substitution of 20 acres of potatoes for 88 acres scheduled for planting with oats.Seed Testing Station. During the week reports have been sent out on 556 samples, making a total of 2,719 out of 4,000 sample received for testing.     Deposit accounts have been opened.by 68 seedsmen up-to-date, the receipts amounting to  488. Several . change s..Jiave been made in the working arrangements of the Stati so as to make full use of the existing accommodation and equip&apos; axa -at the moment tests on over 900 samples are running.   Farirtf are beginning to use the station to a very real extent, and 192 &apos;fa23aers&quot; have sent samples of cereals to be tested.     Oats   -predominate amongst the cereals. :over 770 samples having been received.     A report dealing&quot;with about 2,400 completed tests has been prepared for publication in the February issue of the &quot;Journal of the Board-of Agriculture&quot;.&apos;&quot;
... ... ....  LABOUR ,DIVISION.Soldier. Labour. - The War Office.state that they are prepared to agree to the Depa^aentr^ the Military Authoritiesshould, supply a smaller r^umber of really. ski-Lied men in place of ? the,.unek^^ still to be drawn from the Army under theQabinet decision, of June 27th last, ^and that endeavours are now ..being made., to ascertain the whereabouts of every ploughman of a . Category below &quot;A&quot;, in order that he may be made available for the 19.18 agricultural programme.     It is to be hoped that additional skilled men will be found &quot;at a very early date, as at the present time the Department are quite unable to meet the many demands for skilled,ploughmen that are being made by the Agricultural Executive Committees. The Field Marshal CoimTianding-in-Chief in France has authorised.an extension of one month&apos;s furlough to the ploughmen recently ,sent home on two months agricultural leave.   All Committees were, at once notified but.unfortunately 306 of the men had already gone.back, leaving 1.110 still on the land... Exclusive of tho above men 34,201. (24*096 skilled and 10,105 unskilled).,have been, attached to Depots to date, and of . these. 30,, 170: (22?7  .: skilled and 7,388 unskilled) arc out with farmers...    . ..... .An additional. 11. men. of the South, African Forces havebeen; placed at the disposal^of the Department, during the week, and have been sent out for work under the Horse Scheme....  The total numbers of soldiers sent out for training as tractor drivers to date is 3,029, an additional. 422 men having been sent out during the week.. - .. .      ,     - ,  *, .,Horses ...r, -Orders, or the issue of 74 additional horses have been sent.out;during the week, making a total of 5,437 horses to date&apos;. -Sale of Horses Order - Since the coming into force of the Sale of Horses Order, the Department have liberated horses for essential
trades on the recommendation of the Government Departments concerned.     In this way 1,149 horses were released between July 2 1917, and February 2nd 1918, 737 of these at the request of the recently appointed Controller of Horse Transport.The Controller has made representations to:the effect that road transport is being seriously affected by the operation of the Sale of Horses Order and&apos; that the work of was industries is being impeded, and after consultation between the President of the Board of Trade and the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Department have agreed that all horses found to be surplus to the requirements of the holdings concerned and not required by the Army Council or for agriculture, shall be licensed for sale to persons duly authorised by the Controller of Horse Transport.     Representatives of essential industries will be able to purchase any horse so \licensed, either by private treaty or at auction sales.     Under this arrangement, the Department will endeavour to release not less than 300 horses a week. &apos;Under the form of licence at present in use, any occupia of agricultural land, however small the area, can purchase horses without restriction and considerable leakage has been found to take place.     The form of licence is therefore being amended so as to limit the sale of horses to occupiers who purchase them for use wholly or mainly for the cultivation of their holdings.As indicating the difficulty&quot;which&apos;is being experienced by Agricultural Executive Committees in &quot;obtaining a sufficient nuri of horses for the Increased cultivation in their areas, it may be mentioned that some County Committees have asked for authority to limit the sale of agricultural horses to &quot;purchasersvresident within their Counties, and this has been granted. Prisoners of War - Three additional &quot;ordinary prisoner camps-&apos;-and two ploughmen camps were opened during the week, making a total of 48 agricultural prisoner camps now established, viz.&apos;-- 40 ordinary
camps and 8 ploughmen camps. These camps comprise 4,064 agricul-turists and 276 ploughmen. Information has been received that 11 further ploughmen camps are expected to open during the next seven days.The number of Combatant Prisoners of War now employed on the land is 5,348, and together with 1,543 released aliens make a total of 6,891 prisoners now employed.     In addition, 123 prisoner--ploughmen schemes are with the War Office, and also 14 schemes for the employment of prisoners on ordinary agricultural work.Women&apos;s Branch.The demand for woman labour is at present greater than .the&quot; available supply.     Many of the women lent to the Forage and -&quot;Forestry Sections of the Land Army are being recalled to agricul-ture, but even with this number the urgent demands from farmers cannot be met.    Requests are being received by the Department from all over the country for permission to undertake a recruiting campaign, and permission is being given at once as the women wanted for the spring work should be in training at the latest by the end of the -present month.The Land Army were invited at the last minute to contribute to the Exhibition of Women&apos;s Service opened on 11th February by Princess Arthur of Connaught at Harrod&apos;s Stores.     Scarcely any time was left for making adequate preparations, but figures dressed in the uniform, and some very fine photographs are on view. It has also been arranged for a representative to be in attendance *. all day to answer questions and enrol recruits.During the last fortnight, 4 women have been placed on motor tractor work in Berkshire, 6 in Cheshire and 6 in Lancashire. The women trained in Wiltshire have done excellent work, and one of them has recently delivered three tractors at a distance of 30 to 40 miles without mishap,
An Efficiency Test has been held this week in North Wales.   The six northern counties sent competitors, and about 2,000 people were present.   Thirty women entered for the milking test, this number being made up of five picked competitors from each county.   There were eighteen entries in horse ploughing.   Thc-nine ploughs placed at the womenrs disposal were all of the newest type, and it is interesting to note that although nearly all the women had been accustomed to a more old fashioned plough, they managed the new ones excellently.   The work done was of a high standard.   Great interest was taken in the thatching class, and the opinion was expressed that there will be a great demand for thatchers during the coming season.   The outstanding feature of the whole Test was that the majority of the women who entered were those who had had years of experience on the land.   These had been brought out by the appearance as competitors of the Land Army girls.   Most of the prizes were given to those of long experience, and it is thought that the general result of the Test will be that more farmers will be anxious to employ women, and that more women of the. farming class will endeavour to recruit others into their ranks.   One woman of between 60 and 70 years of age competed in the milking, ploughing and trenching classes.   Her husband had died, her two s-ons had been killed in the war, and she Is at the present laement working her own small holding.   The formers made a collection for her at the meeting, and presented her with  10. Several of the competitors spoke very little English, and some of them had never been in the train before.There are now 51 Group Leaders working throughout the country, and applications have been made for several more.   Nearly all are now occupied in collecting the necessary information for c-&quot;survey&quot; which is being made of the probable demand for, and possible supply of village labour. They are also visiting the Distr:
Representatives and Village Registrars throughout the County in which they are working and endeavouring to stimulate them to further efforts.6,751 women are accounted for as members of the Land Army as follows:-In Instruction Centres ... ... 211On Farm work ... ... 5,883Forage ... ... 428Waiting to be placed in TrainingCentres ... ... 33Waiting In Depot ... ... 50Waiting in their homes ... ... 146Women1s Institutes - As a result of a Womenfs Institute meeting recently held in Oxfordshire, it has been decided to start a Co-operative Live Stock Society of which any residents in the village will be eligible for membership.     The question of Rabbit Clubs is being advocated by an Institute in Hertford, and numerous enquiries are being made on the subject.Successful meetings have been held during the week inSussex, and four new Institutes have been started in the County.Since the last report, six new Institutes have been started inDurham, one in Lincolnshire, one in Huntingdon, one in Hampshireand one in Surrey,MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shows the position as regardsthe provision of tractors owned by the Department:-Consigned to County Committees dnd Tractor Schools up to and including 5th February.............................., .2,228Consigning instruction given duringthe week........................ ...90Less tractors withdrawn........... 2 ......      88On offer to counties,,.........,.............      26Consigned to Scotland......................,     127&quot; Ireland........................_82&apos; 2,551

SUPPLIES DIVISION.^Railway Transport.   Owing to pressure on the railways by the Ministry of Food in connection with the transport of food, complaints of delay in the carriage of fertilisers and seeds are becoming increasingly frequent.     Cases reported to the Department are being taken, up - with the Railway Companies concern and in most cases it is possible to secure improved conditions, at any rate for a time.The attention&apos; of dealers in fertilisers has been called to the importance of ordering supplies in sufficient quantities to constitute full truck loads. Materials for Insecticides.   Arrangements are being made to secure that a sufficient, supply of materials will be available to meet the needs for fruit spraying.. After consultation with the Oils and Fats Branch,, the Ministry of Munitions has agreedsto allot sufficient materials for the manufacture of soft soap, .and similar action has been taken In.regard to arsenate of lead,   It has also been possible to secure shipping space for the import of&quot;85&apos; tons of arsenate from the United States.Negotiations are going on in regard to the supply of Soda Crystals,   This material presents a special difficulty owing to Its industrial and-domestic use, but it is hoped to arrange for dealers to reserve a supply for potato spraying, and give priority to orders guaranteed to be for this purpose only.
Seed Oats. The following figures show the position with regard to stocks and sales of seed oats.Sample No.3 - 44 10 82 83(Blue wool) (Green wool)Manx Oats.Amount Bought1,015 quarters3604164478 1,0661 l,035fr4,1174 quartersAmount Sold.1,015 quarters. 36 Oi      &quot;1774       fl1,553 quart er sSample No.1 L4 L6 L7 LVariety. &quot;Abundance&quot;Irish Oats.Amount Bought.2,643 quarters 1,769      &quot; 893      &quot; 1,607       &quot;6,912 quarters.Scottish Oats.

The total quantity ordered forward or on rail up to the 9th February is 14,655 tons.The total quantities advised as delivered up to the 9th February is 1,129 tons.
ffart Diseases. The opposition to the planting of immune varie in the Gower Peninsula has been considerably reduced. A meet in was held at Gower on 8th February, at which over 200 farmers we; present, and a resolution passed that they would not allow any decrease in the production of potatoes in the Peninsula this ye-whatever burden the Restricted Districts Order might put upon t: and it was resolved that the provisions of the Order be careful: carried out.Pot at o.S pray i ng. Considerable interest is being taken in the Department&apos;s work in connection with spraying at Peterborough a: in Kent. Very successful meetings are being held in Lincolnshi: which are largely attended by farmers. Lectures on spraying in Welsh are being given in Wales, and are perhaps proving the most successful in the whole of the country.Transport of Potatoes and Cereals.   Reports from Scotland indie; that there is very great difficulty in securing transport for seed potatoes and seed oats;   that many of the stations are clo: to,-English traffic for several days in the week, and that v/hen wagons are loaded they frequently lie at the stations because engines are not available to move them.   Corn merchants in Scot!: represent that the difficulty in regard to the transport of seed oats is causing grave concern.The Railway Executive Committee has been asked to assi: in securing better facilities, and it is understood that this matter v/^s considered at a meeting on the 12th inst.- The trans?-of about 20^000 tons of potatoes, is a serious matter, and it is absolutely essential that the &apos;seed! should be got into the hai$ of English&apos;growers in time for planting. The delivery of seed c is even more urgent-.Seed Beans.   Arrangements have been made v/ith a wholesale seed firm to hold at the disposal of this Department 10 tons of        i &quot;Canadian.fonder Beans&quot; and one ton of &quot;Dutch Brown Beans&quot;.
Seed Experts and Military Service.   No reply has yet been received from the Ministry of National Service with regard to tho representations recently made by this Deportment as to the urgent need for the release from the colours of certain named seed experts, and for further protection to be afforded to those experts who, up to the present, remain in their civil employment.Tho Seed Trade is now at the beginning of its busiest season, and unless adequate expert assistance is available it is almost certain that the distribution of seeds will breakdown,ywith serious results to food production.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.Tho Bt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.,President of the Board of agricultureand Fisheries.
