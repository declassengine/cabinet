(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)Department of Information, GHW/007.WEEKLY   REPORT   OH   HOLEAND, VII, (Feb. 13th, 1918)Intelligence Bureau,SECRET *So far is known to this Department no settlement has been reached in the Sand and Gravel Controversy,and Dutch Commercial telegrams, except in a few cases, are stitl not allowed to pass onBritish controlled cables.     One of the best articles which has ap&apos;-peared regarding this unfortunate matter is one by Dr. G.W.Kernkamp in the monthly magazine &quot;Vragen dea Tijds&quot;.    Although casting no doubt 6n the good  aith of the Netherlands Government he is not sat-isfied with their action.    He makes what seems a good suggestion. He thinks that the Netherlands. Government from the first should have insisted on the sand and gravel passing through Dutch territory being controlled till the end of the war by Dutch officials.    That would have settled once and for all the question whether or not the materials are being used by the Germans for war purposes.     If the Germans re-fused to permit such control this could have been answered by thestciDpage of the transit cf sand and gravel over Dutch waterways. Reading between the lines of the whole controversy it is difficult t? resist the conclusion that the Netherlands Government are really quite well aware that the Germans are not acting in goed faith, but that absolute oroof of this is not forthcoming and in these cirouro-stances they have followed the line of least resistance.During the last few weeks the Dutch Eress has been singularly uninteresting and colourless.     Comments on foreign events have been cautious , and little of importance has been said either regarding the progress of the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk ?r the internal situation in Germany and Austria-Hungary.   On the other hand the news-? papers have been full of speeches and articles foreshadowing theId&quot;
struggle which will take place during the General Election next summer..    Lfeanwhile there is r latent political crisis arising out of the unsettled quarrel &quot;between Mr. Posthuma, the Minister of Agricufc-ture and Mr, Treub, Minister of Finance, to which reference was made in Report Ho. V of Dec. 31st last,   Mr. Posthuma&apos;s position has been shaky ever since;   but he has not resigned as was at one time expec-ted-     It is now proposed to create a Ministry to take over the uon-trol of the food supply as well as transport and foreign trade.    If this schome matures it is uncertain what Mr. Posthuma&apos;s position would be.     Mr. Treub, who is a trained economist,vobjects to the distribu-tion of cheap food with the difference between the retail orice and the market price being defrayed by the Treasury.     As Minister of Finance he not unnaturally desires to control the policy for which he has tc find the money.     Some persons think that a compromise might be reached by leaving Mr, Pcsthuma to control purely Agricultural affairs while his rival was placed at the head of the contemplated Ministry of Food.     In an article in the &quot;Telegraaf&quot; which may pos-sibly have been inspired by Mr. Treub, the future policy of the Government as regards food &amp;nd transport is laid down as follows-.-I. The Minister must introduce an absolute State Monopoly for purchases in the home market, for exports and for distribution if he interferes with an article at all.II. Navigation must be on Government account, though practised by shipowners.III. Interior transport should be controlled by the Minister.IV. All negotiations concerned with purchases from abroad or sales to foreign countries or with imports from the Dutch colonies or ex-ports to them should take place according to rules fixed by him.The consequence would be that the Government would bear the re-sponsibility, officially, for all transactions, including those with foreign countries.
A new Institution of some interest is being created at the Hague in the hope of restoring some of the prestige of that capital as a centre of the international peace movement.     The ooject of the founders appears to be to gather together in one central place in-formation of an international character, whether eoonomieal or ju-ridleal, and supply such information to ell applicants.     For instance an JL&amp;s1trian may require information about the British Colony of Jamaica or an Englishman about trade with Mongolia.     These persons would obtain it gratis at the International Intermediary Institute. At -jresent-in order to --ensure impartiality the new movement is ex-clusiveiy controlled by Netherlander, and Mr. J. louden, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, is the Honorary President.     The nec-essary funds have been entirely subscribed by Dutchmen.     The list of the executive has not yet been published, so that it is difficult ttf say what the prospects of the Institute may be, but it is stated that the eontrol is in the hands of raeyi, distinguished by their knowledge both of International Law and Trade.
