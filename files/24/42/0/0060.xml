FIRE AT TETRYL ACETONE PURIFICATION FACTORY, WALTHAM ABBEY, 24TH FEBRUARY, 1918.

(Copy of letter from Capt. Webster, to Secretary, War Cabinet.)

Ministry of Munitions of War,

Whitehall Place,

S.W. 1.

18th February, 1918.

Dear Sir,

I am desired by Mr. Churchill to inform you that information has been received from the Superintendent of Waltham Abbey that the Tetryl Acetone Purification Factory and the Corning plant which is near it caught fire on the night of Thursday, the 14th instant, and were destroyed. Details as to the cause of the fire have not yet been received, but it is known that, there were no casualties.

As regards the effect on material, there are ample stocks of Grade 1 Tetryl, but there may possibly be some difficulty for a short time in providing sufficient supplies of corned material. I may, however, add that the corning process is intended simply to reduce the danger to the health of the workers handling Tetryl, and that if necessary uncorned material can always be used.

Yours faithfully,

(Signed) J.A. WEBSTER.
