Colonel fee?16This document is the property of His Brit&quot;ranic Majosty/s Government3SECRETRECONSTRUCT I OH PIKAiTCE.MEMORAHDUM BY THE MINISTER OP REG OBSTRUCT I OH.2,It would be convenient if some general assurance could be given as soon as possible that measures which are agreed upon as essential in order to give the country a satisfactory start on a peace footing will not bo delayed or refused sanction on the ground of expense.     Sufficient evidence exists to show conclusively that certain things will have to he done, at a very- considerable cost, immediately upon the conclusion of peace.     Some of them I will indicate, but at this stage I am not able to give figures.     Estimates on some of them will be available shortly.     The precise figures do not indeed affect my general contention, namely, that it is useless to prepare plans unless there is a reasonable prospect that such plans will be carried out, always provided that they arc found to be suitable for the purpose&apos; and framed frith due regard to economy.Amongst the urgent matters to be taken in handare: -(a) An adequate housing programme for the United Kingdom involving purchases of materials and acquisition of land on a large scale.(b) A considerable transfer of agricuM-ural lands to public authorities for the purpose of small
&quot;holdings, soldiers1 settlements, afforestation and reclamation.(c) The reconstruction of roads and the repair of railways and their equipment *(d) The financing for a time in whole or in part by the State of certain essential industries.(e) An extension of unemployment insurance to meet the dislocation of industry that is to be expected during the transition period.. (f) Ik strengthened health service both at thecentre and locally the necessity of which is already urgent and will be aggravated by the return of the armies to overcrowded surroundings and defective sanitary conditions arising from the neglect of public health during the war. (g) It may be found necessary, as the result of inquiries now proceeding, for the State!s guarantee to be given if the credit offered by the Banks is insufficient to enable manufacturers to start work on a peace footing, whether in the execution of orders or in making to stock.This list is far from being exhaustive, and i have not included in it the various heads of expenditure in respect of bread, potatoes, etc which must bo continued, nor the further charges which must arise if it is found impossible to devote any appreciable amount of tonnage to the transport of materials for some time after the war.     The cost of demobilisation, apart from the payment of war rratuities and transport, will-bo relatively inconsiderable, unless the
threatened shortage of materials renders it necessary -greatly to extend the period during which it will be carried out.It is clearly necessary that a general decision Should be arrived at as to the attitude which the Government proposes to adopt towards demands for after-war expenditure.     There arc two broad lines of ar-gument in regard to this.     On the one side the view that everything should be subordinated to tho paying off of debt and that&quot; there is no prospect of a p$&apos; mancnt or substantial restoration of prosperity until a eon- &quot; siderablc part of our war indebtedness has been liquidated.     It follows from this that the total expenditure of the State should be kept as low as possibly:-that cervices such as housing, land settlement&apos;/ and the improvement of public health and presumably the restoration of transport services to their full capacity, must wait until the efforts at extinguishing debt are reflected in the improvement of national credit and international.exchange.There would on the other hand, it appears to me, bo more force in this argument if it could be shown in the first place that the expenditure required for the purposes I have named involved the withdrawal of capital from production, and in the second place, if its advocates could explain by what method, other than by the maximum development of all our resources for the maximum of output in the minimum of time, we can ever hope to pay off debt and to restore the national credit. As to the first, it cannot bo too strongly urged
that capital expenditure on every one of the subjects I have cited is as vital to efficient production as if it were invested in machinery or factory buildings. To say that the workman must be healthy and must have a house is simply to state two of the prime factors in the scheme of production which we all desire.     The means for realising it will not be forthcoming except through the State and so far from withdrawing from industry the capital it requires the State in performing these obligation towards its citizens will be discharging a function which is essential to industry.It appears to me that the restoration of prosperity and public credit can only be secured if we are prepared to incur expenditure essential for establishing at the earliest possible moment, the fullest measure of national productivity.    &quot;By al] means let us pay off our debts if we can.     But how can we until the conditions required for creating wealth and restoring credit arc first of all restored, even though the process is costly and involves a fresh drain upon our depicted credit?   A discontented population and an iilrcpaircd machine offer, as it seems to mo, an improvident means of debt-extinction.Two things should be borne in mind in this connection.     First the enormous advances in productiveness to which the war has accustomed us.     The improved cr-ganisation and methods and processes which wc arc master-ing should enable us to create wealth at a much greater rate than that to which we were accustomed bef ore *&quot;thc w ar In the second place, the expenditure contemplated will, unlike war. expenditure, return to.the country a dividend: of increased health, good will, energy and intelligence. I
suggest-therefore that the restoration and development of our productive capacity to its fullest extent with the assistance of State credit and public services wherever it can be shewn that private means and enterprise arc unavailing should be accepted for what it is, that is to say, the condition precedent to extinguishing debt,and restoring credit. 0. I fear that if support should not be given to thisview the difficulties awaiting us after peace will be too much for this or any Government to contend against.     If I and my ^colleagues concerned can count upon financial support plans can bo matured which ought to tide us over some of our most dangerous problems:   but if wc are to be left in uncertainty as to whether these plans arc to be given effect to our task will become impossible.     Of one thing I am quite sure.     It will be no defence to say that vital proposals Yfcrc not enacted for want of money, ITobody will believe it.     Wc shall be told that tho money would have been forthcoming if it had been required for -   the war and we shall be pressed to accept all manner of wild proposals and to devise hastily extemporised expedients which will satisfy nobody.     I hope that we shall not have to legislate and spend money for rcc-on-struction purposes in an atmosphere of panic engendered by violent agitation aud well-founded discontent; but I do most seriously suggest that this is an alternative that cannot be disregarded if our plans arc laid for a half-hearted tentative scheme of reconstruction based on the view that wc cannot afford to prepare for peace,CHRISTOPHER ADDISON. 10.2.18.
