Eff CLOSURE.Copy of letter from Mr. 0. T, Crosby to Mr. OhurahillaPAKIS. 26th January, 1910.Sir,As you may already bo aware, the Inter-Ally Councilon War Purchases and Finance is charged with the duty of inquiring into and mailing recommendations concerning purchases &quot;by European Allies in the United States, particularly, and else in neutral countries.   A very large item in these purchases is, of course, on account of munitions.   An embarrassment existing in this situation to-day arises from the fact that orders must ho placed for munitions a good many months before they can he received.     The result is that commitments are actually made, and if funds are not in the hands of the Allied Governments placing these orders, there is at least a tacit feeling that they should he supplied by the United States Treasury,In order to forecast as nearly as possible the needs of the Allies for these purposes, it is desired first of all that the-existing outstanding orders for munitions from the United States and the probabla dates of delivery on such orders should be known. Such a list isas placed before the Treasury of the United States by JcPcMorgan &amp; Coc at the beginning of the loan operations in Washington, and showed in very satisfactory form, for purposes of provision, the character, quantity, cost and deliveries under the various contracts then in force.     I trust, therefore, it will be possible at an early date that the Council may receive at its offices at Wo. Z Rue St. Florentin, and in duplicate to my address in London, at present Claridge&apos;s Hotel, such lists as are here indicated.In addition to the information asked above, it is also desirable that statements should be had of all the actually delivered material which is awaiting shipment in the United States,     Further,, it Is desirable, that information should be had as to the stocks of materials actually on hand In England, France and Italy,, in. orjer that they may be compared so that the needs of one may possibly in emergency be filled from- the other without calling upon- the United States either for the furnished article on raw material corresponding to stocks that may be full in the hands of one- Ally although short in the hands of another Ally..     It would be helpful also that th* information should be given in this connection concerning the amount of ra?; material of a given kind,, as for exampler steel bars, required to make up Into a given number of shells. It is a well known fact to-day that the French Government has large stocks of steel bars- in the United States for v^hich ton-riage is not available..   Are these available for other Allies,, who perhaps will be able to. ship them?.     A total French stock of ail kinds has now been accumulated in. the United States&apos; amounting to over 1,000,000. tons of material..   This fact certainly must, suggest a challenge of orders from other Allies-as to whether or not they, can be satisfied from some of these accumulated stocks or not...ftith these classes- of facts laid before the Council,, it will be-possible to more intelligently pass upon questions-presented by orders yet to be placecU     Already in its dis-cussions of lists presented to. it,, the Council, has found reason to belietQ that while: one Ally is calling insistently for&apos; material of a given character because of a shortage in that material,.
another Ally may be overstocked with the same material.-Thus, if the new order be placed, waste of money, waste of tonnage, and delay in obtaining the article in question will.result.In order to expgiite the operation herein suggested,,&apos; I enclose a list (Appendix) of the headings of materials of all kinds under which the requests of your Government are made to the Council.   Some of these headings are for articles other than munitions, but the whole list is sent for your general information.     If it could be followed in making up the tables which I have herein requested, it would be possible to conveniently compare the requests for new material with statements concerning the material ordered but not yet delivered;    the materials delivered but not yet shipped, and the materials in stocks behind the lines.If in this letter I am asking for any information which is already tabulated, or if I am asking for a study of correlate needs which is already made and therefore should not be dupli-cated by another Inter-Ally organism, I should be glad to be so informed,     The result of such correlated study, if it exists I trust will then be placed before the Inter-Ally Council in order that it may make recommendations, as it has undertaken to do, for such disposition of funds of the United States Treasury as may be available, and which funds, under the statute and according to the opinion and intention of the President and the Secretary of the Treasury are in all oases to be allocated with a view to their best uses in the prosecution of the war.It has long been the earnest conviction of thoso con-cerned with this matter in the United States that much remains to be done in respect to the correlation of the needs of the Allies as they have been disclosed to the United States Govern-ment since April 1917, in various independent and almost competitive requests for loans.   Nothing but a sincere, anxiety to work for the common cause and to maie the funds of the United States work best for that common causo inspired the Government of the United States in asking for the establish-raent of the Inter-Ally Council and nothing else inspires me in thus addressing you, asking that in addition to your present manifold duties you would be good enough to give attention to this request.In the meantime, I remain Cordially yoursP.S.   It is possible that all or oortions of the inquiry here made may have reached you through one of the Secretaries of the Council.   Lack of the established office facilities and.the requirement of conducting the affairs of the Council from two headquarters, one of which is a hotel in London, for the moment results in a certain amount of confusion.    In so far as there may be duplication in this letter of any such inquiries, thus made by others, I trust it will be overlooked.The Kight Hon.Winston Churchill,Minister of Munitions, LOHLGH.
