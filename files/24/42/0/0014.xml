38fjgJS aaaagflg  2 IS IR^tmX 0* HIS BBniBHIC igj2Sn&apos;3 Q0t8MBI8Kgj1Dear Lord Rhondda,In pursuance of the interview you kindly granted to a Committee of London Members of Parliament, I now beg to put into writing the main points that we brought betjr% you.I may say that those whowsited on you were appointed by a very largely attended meeting of all the London members from all parties and you may take it that we are unanimous on the main points that were brought before you.1.        Vte would ask you most earnestly te take suon aotion as will ensure that no steps be taken to olose the Port Of London or further reduce to any large extent the number of ships that are bringing food to that Port.We make this request because we were informed on good authority that the Admiralty were diverting ships from Lendes te Liverpool and were contemplating the total closing of London1s Port. We have seen Sir Joseph Maolay together with representative of the Admiralty and they have told us that while they are eompelled by the exigencies of the submarine warfare to direot that certain ships coming to London should discharge at Liverpool or other Western ports they have no intention of closing the Port of London altogether.   At tfca same time, it is evident to ua that even the latter course may byeome necessary and that certainly a great part of the food supply of London is now being landed on the Western Coast.tfo fully appreciate the serious danger caused by submarines in the Channel and the difficulties that arise in the process of convoying ships through these waters but on the ether hand we do not think that sufficient attention has bean given to the difficulties which will attend any efforts to supply London v/ith food entirely from the Western Coast.    $either the Western ports nor the cross country railways are suited to undertake this task and we view such a proposal with serious apprehensions.     In any case we oonsider that no such action ought to be taken by the Admiralty or the Shipping Controller fcnleee you are consulted and are satisfied that the feeding of London can be undertaken successfully in this manner.   Wt trust that you will bring this question before the War Cabinet and obtain some assurance on this point,H.        The second matter to which we ask your attention is with re* gard to the supply of meat to London.   As you are aware the present shortage of meat is causing intense publio anxiety and disturbance is likely te arise shortly unless some relief can be afforded in this respect.    Even if the introduction of meat tiokets on February 25th., puts an end to the queues it is probable that if the meat rations are then unobtainable publio indignation will grow rapidly, and events might occur in London which might even Jeopardise the nation&apos;s prospect of success in the war.     We prass this point in no alarmist sense but because we think that the Mat Cabinet should be prepared to take sxoeption&amp;l measures to see that the rationed quantity of meat for tha people of London should be available in the case of serious emergency.    ^e tire informed that whilst thereW A ft    C A B I IT S t.
is but little meat in London for civilian consumption there are large quantities kept in store for the Army. It is unnecessary for me to say that the London members have no desire to deprive the Army of a? supplies that it requires, but they suggest that some of the meat he? in store for the men who are stationed in this country might be temporarily used to meet the urgent needs of the civilian population if the situation becomes serious. They hope that you will consider this proposal and if you think fit convey it to the War Cabinet.

3. There are some minor points to which individual members of the deputation invited your attention. It was suggested that greater efforts should be made to prevent soldiers in England from obtaining at canteens or elsewhere food over and above their rations. It was suggested that in various institutions provided for the accommodation soldiers considerable supplies of meat are being used up which otherwise would be available for the ordinary population. The rations allowed by the Army Council fully suffice for the requirements of the soldiers in the Home Army and it is reasonable to ask that they should not deprive the civilian population of any part of the limited supply now at the latter&apos;s disposal.

Another point raised was that of the effect of maximum prices of the fish supply in London. A member stated that retail fishmongers are being compelled to pay the maximum price to wholesale dealers and therefore have to sell to their customers at a loss or not at all. Your attention was invited to this matter, as it may result in London being deprived of fish.

I am,

Yours very truly,

(Signed). W.H.DICKINSON.
