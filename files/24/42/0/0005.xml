f This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)SECRET.OPBRAT IONS.Prom :- General de Candolle, Rostoff.ToC* I *G* S*Handed in at 11.30 a.m. 9.2.18.Received at 2.10 p.m. 10.2.18.The military situation has become worse and Alexieff fears a retreat from Rostoff is inevitable.     He should in that case in a few days (?) force his way to Ekaterinodar in the hope of being able to make a fresh start there and ultimately to retire to Tsaritsin.I shall telegraph again to-day but wish at once to report that yesterday I ui-^cussed with Hucheiet how we should act if the retreat takes place.\/e decided it would be best course for us to remain at Rostoff and Novochercask respectively.     Please wire your instructions and ask Paris to instruct Hucheiet, via Bombay, that being the only communication to him.In order to appreciate the development&apos;&apos; of events here I recommend that all my previous telegrams he re-read.A few travellers have recently reached here from the north via Tsaritsin, route still occasionally open.   From their statements and from admissions by individuals lie re I gather that events outside the Don area are much less, favourable to the league than ?/e had been told.     If so the whole movement must, in my opinion, fail*     This is not repeated Barclay, as telegraph lines are cut.
This Document is the Property of - 210 PER A T I 0 H S.From:-   General Candolle. To:-      C.X.G.S.Handed in at 7.10 p.m. 9*2.l8. Received at 5 p.ia, 10.2,18,Humber mutilated.In continuation of my telegram 28.The positions held to-day by the League troops lie only about 30 miles Horth of Hovochercask and 30 miles West of Rostoff.   Moreover the wastage of the scanty supply of munitions and men is serious,the. new enlistments not exceeding the casualties.   The amazing apathy displayed both here and elsewhere in Russia by the very classes ^ho should be interested in restoring orders is the direct cause of the smallness of the numbers enlisting.As regards the possible retreat of the League forces Ekaterinodar is, of course, well situated for food supplies and the Circassian hill tribes in that neighbourhood are friendly though the terms they demand for giving active support are both onerous and ineffectual.   But Alexieff i3 still in treaty with them.The League does not expect, anyhow for the present, support from the more numerous hill&apos; tribes on the northern slopes of the Caucasus. On the other (?) hand Kharlamoff avers that they are on the point of settling their differences- with tlie Terek Cossacks, the latter yielding parts of the contested lands of the Sunja.   The Terek Cossacks like those of the Don, have chosen this awkward moment to hold a general election for their Krug.As against the danger of the position here to-day, there remains of course the possibility that the Bolshevick may not be able to push their attack home.Personally I am convinced that with the help of local risings they will shortly do so.   For although their fighting force is small there is no doubt that they are the dominant party throughout Russia. They are likely to remain, for some time yet, the dominant party, so that to me it seems unwise for the Allies to risk driving them yet more into the lap of Germany by embittering them and openly fostering opposition to them.
