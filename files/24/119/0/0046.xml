To    Tho Right Hon. W. S. Churchill, M.P. Sir,      1.  We  were appointed by Cabinet Minute of the  11th January, 1921,  to  make recommendations ior carrying out the Cabinet decisions of the  31st December, 1920, in regard to the formation of a new Department under the Colonial Office to doal with the administration of British  mandated territories in the Middle East.  We were instructed to report to  you by the 1st February for reference to the Prime Minister.    I.-DEFINITION  OF  THE TERRITORIAL  SPHERE OF  THE NEW                                 DEPARTMENT.      2. In our terms of reference, which are set  out in full on  the opposite page, it  is laid down that the Department to be set up is to &quot;comprise in principle  Mesopotamia, Aden and Palestine.&quot;   We assume that it was intended that the term Palestine should cover Trans-Jordania.   We are,  however, faced  at  the outset  with  the following difficulty : Mesopotamia,  Aden and  Palestine tire not conterminous.   The  large inter- vening area is sparsely inhabited  by Arab tribes, who depend in the .main  on one or other of these  three territories for their contact with  the  outside world.  The land boundary of  the Aden Protectorate  is fixed on the West and North, but  remains undefined on the East, and the land boundaries  of Mesopotamia and Palestine on the south-west and east, respectively, have not  yet been determined.   Owing to the fact that  the nomad tribes in the adjoining territories move  freely to and fro between the desert and the more settled areas, it  is questionable whether these boundaries can ever be defined in a final and satisfactory  manner.     3. We understand that Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres provides that the disposal of this  Central Arabian area, with the exception of the Hedjaz, is to be made by the Principal Allied  Powers ; that it has been the intention of the Foreign Office to obtain  recognition  from  the  other  Principal Allied Powers of the  special  political interests of Great Britain  in these areas; but that it has not yet been found possible to approach them with this end in view.     Although the Kingdom of the Hedjaz has been recognized as an independent State, none of its land boundaries have as yet been fixed.     We also understand that it was the intention of the Foreign Office to submit that the delimitation of  the boundaries of Mesopotamia and Palestine should be undertaken by Great Britain as the mandatory for these  two areas,  in  conjunction with the Arab rulers concerned.     4.  In considering the steps to be taken to form a new Department to  deal with the administration of Mesopotamia, Aden and Palestine, we have  found it essential to take into account the future of  the intervening area,  and the  special difficulties  arising out of the absence of clearly defined boundaries.    We have assumed that  it was the underlying intention  of  the  Cabinet decisions  of the 31st December last  that all administrative  and political responsibilities  which  will devolve upon His Majestys Government in respect of  the Arab areas of the Middle East  should, as far  as possible, be placed under the control of one Department.   The wording of our terms of reference quoted above has encouraged us in this belief.     5. On the assumption that it is  the  intention of  the Cabinet that the Middle Eastern, or rather the Arab, problem should be treated as one organic whole, we considerthat the guiding principle  should be that the new Department should be responsible fordirecting policy as regards the whole Arabian peninsula, subject to certain qualifications,which are discussed  later, regarding the  Kingdom of the Hedjaz.         6. We  accordingly recommend, subject  to certain  reservations  to which we    refer later,  that  the sphere of  the new  Department should include  all the    territories south and  east of the  newly defined boundary between the  French    mandated territories of Syria and the British mandated territories of Palestine and    Mesopotamia.   Oo the west this  sphere would  be bounded by the Mediterranean ;    on the south-west by the frontier of Egypt  and the  Red Sna; on  the  south  and    south-east by the Indian  Ocean;  on the north-east by the north-eastern boundary    of Mesopotamia and by the Arabian littoral  of the Persian Gulf.    (8&apos;JM-l)                                                                A 2
     7. This will entail the assumption by the new Department of all responsibility for the obligations resulting from the treaties which His  Majesty&apos;s Government  have from time to &quot;time negotiated with the Chiefs of the  various districts of Arabia, and the responsibility for the  negotiation of further treaties of this description.   It will also entail the new  Department  having an influential if not a  determining voice  in  the delimitation of the boundaries which have not yet been fixed, though the  negotiations with the Principal  Allied Powers would of course be conducted  through the ordinary diplomatic channels.     8. With regard to the north-eastern boundarv of the area, for which we recommend that the -new Department should be responsible, we offer the  following observations :      (1.) Kurdistan. We  understand   that  Article  64  of the Treaty of  Sevres provides that, if within a period of one year from  the coming into force  of the  Treaty the majority of  the  Kurdish peoples inhabiting the areas between the  Armenian and Mesopotamian frontiers  shall demand to   be independent, and if the  Council  of the League considers them capable  of such independence, Turkey will renounce  all rights and title over these areas.  In  this case  no objection will be  raised by the  Principal Allied Powers to the voluntary adhesion to such  an independent Kurdish  State of the Kurds  inhabiting that part  of  Kurdistan (generally known as  Southern Kurdistan) which has hitherto been included in the Mosul Vilayet.         We recommend  that pending  such a  development the  responsibility for     Kurdistan should  be vested in the new Department.     9.-(2.) Persian  Gulf  littoral.-These areas have for the last  hundred years or more been under the political control of the Government of  India, exercised for  the past fifty years through  an  officer of the  Government of India,  with headquarters at Bushire with the title  of Political Resident in the Persian  Gulf who also controls the  Northern (Persian)  littoral  as  well  as certain  inland  Consulates  in  South Persia.   The Gulf is thus dealt  with as a single administrative unit  for  all purposes. Posts at Bushire and on  either side  of the Gulf  are  interchangeable.   The officers at each political agency  (including an Arab residency agent at  Sharjah, on the Trucial coast) correspond  with the  Government  of  India through  the  Political  Resident at Bushire.   This  pout is  always  held by  an officer of many  years&apos;  experience  of the Gulf, assisted by an  adequate staff.     10.  All the accounts of the stations in the Gulf are dealt  with at  Bushire, where there is a Treasury of  the Government of  India.   The currency of the Persian Gulf is almost exclusively Indian and the amounts involved are very large  (e.g., the Bahrein pearl trade alone aggregates over 4,000,000/. annually).    Almost all  trade  is  with India ; the Gulf lives almost wholly on cereals imported from India.   Indian  merchants handle the bidk of the trade.     11. Quarantine, Postal and  Telegraphic Services, Public Works, Lights and Buoys,Naval duties,  Military  detachments and Political and Administrative personnel through-out the Persian Gulf are provided, controlled and partly paid for by India. The transfer to the new Department of the Arabian littoral would entail an additional burden on HisMajesty&apos;s Treasury  and  could scarcely be  accomplished without much  confusion and possible friction.   At the same time, we realize that the fact of Ibn Saud&apos;s  territoryhaving an outlet on the Gulf renders it essential that the new Department  should havea deciding voice  in all questions of policy affecting the littoral.         12. We accordingly recommend that the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf     should  remain under the control of the Political Resident in the  Persian Gulf;    that  this officer should  be  appointed as at present  by the Government of India,     but should  be  authorized  to  communicate  direct  with  the Colonial  Office on     matters concerning the Arabian littoral; that the functions of the  Government of     India in respect of the Arabian  littoral should be confined to administrative and    purely local matters, and that the prior concurrence of the Colonial  Office  should    be obtained by them to any measures of political significance ; and lastly, that the    relations  of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  with  Ibn Saud  should  be conducted    exclusively by the new Department through   the  Political Resident at Bushire in    the first place.  It may  also be desirable to  provide that the Political Agent at    Bahrein, whom  we  understand  to be the official in direct  touch with Ibn Saud,    should in cases of urgency be communicated with direct by the new Department.
     13.  Relations with the Kingdom of the Hedjaz. If these arrangements are carried out, the Colonial Office will become the authority responsible  for the direction of the Arabian  policy of His  Majesty&apos;s Government, except in regard to the Kingdom of the  Hedjaz.  On  geographical  grounds,  there would be  obvious  advantages  in an arrangement by which negotiations with the  Kingdom of the Hedjaz were entrusted to the Department which is to be responsible for the territories  surrounding it on  three sides.  It is  also  clear that  the  new Department  will be seriously  hampered  in its dealings  with Central Arabia if  it is not in a position to exercise a direct influence over the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the Kingdom of the Hedjaz.     14,  It may appear somewhat anomalous  that  negotiations  with an independent Kingdom should be entrusted to any Department other than the Foreign Office.   It has been  suggested that  the direct  conduct  of negotiations between the Government of India  and Afghanistan presents a somewhat similar  arrangement  to that indicated above, but  we  understand it to  be  the view of the Foreign  Office, that the case of Afghanistan does not offer an exact analogy with that of the Hedjaz,     Afghanistan  is not in general diplomatic relations with  Western Powers ; it  is  not a  member of the League  of Nations; it  has practically no  means of access to  the outside world, and geographical reasons alone would be  sufficient  to  make the Viceroy of India the channel  of communication between His Majesty&apos;s  Government and  the Afghan Government.   The Hedjaz, on the other hand, has only to ratify the  Treaty of Versailles to regularize its position as an original member of the League of Nations ; it&quot;contains  the  holiest cities of Islam, to which large numbers  of the Moslem subjects of every power  in the world make, an annual pilgrimage ; it lies on the Red Sea, and thus has access by water  to the  outside world, and European Powers will continue  to be represented there in the future, as they have been in the past.   We cannot  deny that there is considerable force in  this  argument.   At  the same time, we are impressed with the paramount importance of the general direction and  control of the Arabian policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government being vested  in one Department  of State, though we regard any  arrangement by which the representative of  Hi,s Majesty&apos;s Government in  the Hedjaz should communicate  with any Department other than the  Foreign Office as unworkable.         15.  We  accordinglv recommend that the  channel  of communication between    His  Majestys Government and the Hedjaz Government should still be the Foreign    Office, but that in all questions affecting purely Arab politics the Colonial  Office    should be regarded as the responsible British authority.                 II. SCOPE OF  THE NEW  DEPARTMENT.    16.  We have thought it  necessary to discuss  at  some length  the definition of  the territorial sphere  for  which  the  new Department should   be responsible, since  it was clearly impossible  for us to make  effective recommendations while it remained  uncertain what areas were under consideration.  For the same  reason we  think it necessary to have some working definition of che scope of the new Department  before proceeding to discuss in detail the steps to be taken with regard  to its formation.   If our interpretation of the intentions of the Cabinet in regard to the territorial sphere of the new Department is  accepted, the Colonial Office  will become  the  responsible  British  authority  on all matters relating to :     (a.)  Administration and  policy in Mesopotamia, Palestine and Aden.    (6.)  Policy in other Arab areas within the British sphere of influence.    (a)  The delimitation of boundaries between British spheres and the territories of           independent Arab rulers.    (d.)  All  expenditure, whether civil or  military, which may fall upon Imperial funds           as a result of British responsibility ior and interest in  the areas concerned.    17.  Some of  the problems arising out  of  this definition have been dealt with  inthe recommendations  which  we  have already made.  As  regards  (d), we  have not considered the question of financial adjustments with the Government of India.    nor have we examined the larger question of  the incidence of expenditure in respect of the mandated territories.    There remain three questions of major importance :     (1.)  The arrangements to be  made for carrying  out British military policy in the           Middle East, and  the relations between the Colonial  Office, and the War           Office  and Air Ministry.
    III.-MILITARY  ARRANGEMENTS.   RELATIONS  BETWEEN   THE COLONIAL  OFFICE,  AND  THE  WAR  OFFICE  AND  AIR   MINISTRY.     18. The  Cabinet  decisions of  the  31st  December  last  contemplate  that a fundamental change shall be made in the present position whereby the War Office and Air. Ministry bear the cost of military operations in Mesopotamia and have to answer for such expenditure in Parliament, while the  policy is in the main  laid down by  other Departments.  We have, therefore, to consider what should be the relationship between these two Service Departments and the  Colonial Office in regard to military operations in Mesopotamia.     19. This question will of necessity be affected by the decision taken as to the  foroe which is to be maintained in  Mesopotamia.  We  understand  that a Committee has been considering  this question under the  chairmanship of the Adjutant-General to the Forces, and that  the general policy  aimed at is  to  replace the bulk of  the  regular garrison by an effective force of armed Constabulary and certain specially raised Indian (or possibly  African)  units officered from the British  and/or Indian Armies.   We understand that it is contemplated that the Colonial  Office should recruit this latter force  through an  officer holding a post of Inspector-General under the Colonial Office, and that the arrangements should in the  main be similar to those already, existing as regards  the  recruitment  and maintenance  of  the King&apos;s  African Rifles and West African Frontier Force.  The Colonial Office would arrange direct with the War Office for the loan  of officers and personnel to form  the necessary cadre and would  assume direct  and full financial  responsibility.    We  will return  later to  these proposals. The more immediate and important question is to decide upon the arrangements to be iuade to tide  over the  transition period  before  this eventual normal  establishment is reached.    20. We have assumed that for some  time it will probably be necessary to maintain in Mesopotamia a considerably larger force than  this eventual establishment.   It istherefore  necessary to devise means for  putting an end  at once  to  the present unsatisfactory system of divided responsibility.    21. A possible solution would be for  the Colonial Office to set up  a  completemilitary organization, which -should  be in a position to offer military advice as to theforces necessary to carry out the policy decided upon by the Secretary of State for theColonies, and should  be responsible for  all the military  and  financial arrangementsnecessary to maintain troops in Mesopotamia.  This suggestion does  not in  any way commend itself to  us.   It would be  uneconomical  to the  highest  degree and wouldinvolve duplisation of work.   Further, it is most  undesirable to set up a large depart-ment  to perform a task which it is hoped  will be  in the  nature  of a decreasing liability.         22.  We  recommend  during  the transitional  period that the  War Office and    the Air Ministry should continue to  be the  Departments responsible  for advising    as to the forces required to carry out the general military policy decided upon. .         We trust that  the   Secretary of ^tate  lor  the Colonies  may,  with  the    concurrence of the Secretary of State for War  and the Secretary  of State for Air,    have the advice of the departments  of the War Office and Air Ministry concerned,    on all questions affecting their respective forces.         23.  Further, we recommend  that the War Office and Air  Ministry should act    as agents for  the Colonial  Office  in  maintaining  such  regular forces, and in    conducting such military and air operations as may be required  in  Mesopotamia    during the transitional period.(2.) The civilian Services  which  will  he  required  for the  Administration  of       Palestine, Mesopotamia, and Aden, and for political duties in  other parts of       Arabia.(3.) The constitution of the new Depaitment of the Colonial Office.We propose to deal with each of these questions separately.
     This  question requires  further explanation both on  its financial side and  in its military aspect.     24. Financial relations. In its financial aspect, the War Office and Air Ministry would be responsible for including in their estimates of the cost of the Army and loyal Air Force, as a whole, the expenditure to be incurred in Mesopotamia, and would  show a recovery of that sum  to  be made as an Appropriation in Aid  to  Army and Air Estimates.   The Colonial Office would at a later stage present to Parliament estimates which  would include  an amount to be repaid to the War Office and Air  Ministry in respect of tins expenditure, and would charge their accounts with the amounts certified by the War Office and Air Ministry to have been expended.  As far as finance is con- cerned, the Colonial Office would have  to  repay to the War  Office and Air  Ministry within the financial year, but if accounts were not immediately available, we should recommend the payment of advances  within the year up to amounts estimated by the War Office and Air Ministry to be required : certificates of actual expenditure would be required  from the War  Office and Air Ministry, but the  total which they were able to certify before tne accounts for a given year closed, to have  been expended up to the 31st March preceding, would be finally charged  in Colonial Office accounts for  that year.     Similar arrangements should be made in regard to the military and  air expenditure of the War Office and. Air Ministry, respectively, in Palestine.     25. For the purposes of securing adequate control, India Office military expenditure in respect of Indian Army  troops  serving in  Mesopotamia  should  be  charged in the first instance to the War Office.   The latter would, therefore, include in their original estimates of  cost to  be incurred,  and  also as part of the recovery from  Colonial Office, such Indian Army expenditure.     26. We consider  that the Chief Financial Advisers to the High Commissioners in Mesopotamia  and  Palestine  should be responsible for advising  their respective High Commissioners in regard to expenditure generally.         27. We   recommend  that  the  financial  arrangements  outlined  in  the     preceding paragraphs should take effect as from the 1st April, 1921.     28.  Relations between  Civil  and Military Authorities. We  recommend that  the High Commissioner in  Mesopotamia should,  as  is   customary  elsewhere, have the titular rank of Commander-in-Chief, it being understood that the possession of this  title will  not  confer  on  him any  right  to give  executive  commands to the troops.   We recommend that  the General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia should be appointed by the War Office and Colonial Office in conjunction.     29.  On matters of principle or policy  in their military aspects,, the General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia should only communicate with the War Office through the High Commissioner, but he should have the right to communicate direct with the War Office  on questions of intelligence, training and preparation for war, as  well as on matters affecting the routine  administration of the Army.     We understand that this is the arrangement suggested  to regulate the relations of the Commander-in-Chief in India with the authorities at home.     It would also be well to  ensure that the Hio-h Commissioner  and the  General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia on the one hand  and the Colonial Office and the War Office on the other should exchange regularly telegrams of  mutual interest.     We think that these arrangements, which  give  effect  to  the principle of the ultimate responsibility of the military to the civil authority, will regulate satisfactorily the relations of the departments concerned, and  that they should be  adopted from the date on which the  Colonial Office takes over the control of Mesopotamia.   &apos;  30. There is however, one respect in which we would delay the  application of this arrangement.  We do not think it right that the Colonial Office should  be called uponto assume any responsibility  in regard to the military operations connected with  thewithdrawal of the  British forces in North-West Persia.         31. We therefore recommend that the  financial and military responsibility for     the withdrawal of British Forces from North-West Persia should remain with  the     War. Office until  this  Force has  been, withdrawn within the   boundaries  oi     Mesopotamia,  and  become  subject  to the  ultimate control of the High  Com-     missioner.
     32. There would thus be three stages in the process by which the War  Office willdivest itself of responsibility for military policy in the Middle East.     (1.) The  withdrawal  stage   during  which the  War  Office  is  to retain full           responsibility for the operations in Persia, until the withdrawal is complete.     (2.) The transitional period during which time the  War Office and  Air  Ministry           will  act  as  agents  lor the Colonial Office in the manner indicated above.     (3.) The stage when the normal establishment has been reached.  This establishment           is  to  consist mainly of personnel under the direct  control of the Colonial           Office.   The special forces of white constabulary and  Indian (or possibly           African) units would be administeLed and controlled by the Colonial Office.           Any regular Units required in addition  in the early stages would be lent by,           the War Office and Air Ministry as during the transitional period.     33. A similar arrangement  as to  the relations between  the civil  and militaryauthorities is already in force  in  Palestine.   There is,  however, this difference, thatthe troops stationed  in Egypt and Palestine are for  certain purposes regarded as one force, under the Command of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,  EgyptianExpeditionary Force, who,  of  course,  can  transfer troops  from Egypt to Palestineor vice versa, but  delegates such  powers as he thinks  suitable to  the  General OfficersCommanding  in  Egypt and  Palestine.   The High  Commissioner for Palestine  istitular  Commander-in-Chief,  and  is responsible  for  the general  policy adopted inPalestine, subject to the special limitation imposed by these circumstances.                           IV. CIVILIAN SERVICES.     34. We are asked to  &quot; recommend in  outline the steps to be taken to form a Middle Eastern Service for the  administration of British  mandated territories in the Middle East; and for the discharge of British responsibilities in regard to them.&quot;     35. Administration  of  Palestine. Arrangements  for  the formation of  a Palestinian service  are already  far advanced.  We  understand  that  staff has been recruited by  the High Commissioner on  the  basis  of  a provisional establishment, and   that   negotiations   are now  proceeding  between   the  Foreign  Office  and Treasury as to the permanent grading to be adopted  for the  officials of the Palestine administration.   It  has  been agreed in principle  that posts  in  this service are to be pensionable, but the details of the pension scheme  have not yet been settled.   In the circumstances, wTe do not consider it necessary to make  detailed recommendations.  The final settlement of negotiations with the Treasury as to the details of the scheme would be  handed over to the Colonial Office by the Foreign Office.     36. We are of the  opinion that having regard  to the  fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government, as the Mandatory for Palestine, have undertaken to give  effect  to the proclaimed policy of establishing a national  home  for the Jewish people  in Palestine, and to the special international importance of  the country, it would not in any case prove feasible to combine into  one service the administration of  Palestine and  of the other areas within the sphere of the new Department.         37.  We  therefore recommend that  the  Palestinian Service  should remain     distinct  from whatever service  it  may be necessary to  set up to  fulfil British     responsibilities in other areas of the Middle East.     38.  In  dealing  with  the civilian staff  required  for the  other  areas,  we find  it necessary to distinguish  two  main categories :  first, the  technical services which are necessary to carry on Government services - in the  settled  districts,  e.g.,  irrigation and postal services,  railways, customs, &amp;c.;  secondly,  the officers who will be required to  act as advisers to the Arab  authorities.  It will  be convenient to deal first with the technical services.     39.-Technical services. (1.) Persian Gulf  littoral.-In paragraph 12 we have already recommended that for administrative and purely local purposes the control of the  Government of India over the Arabian  littoral of the  Persian  Gulf should bemaintained.
           It follows from  this recommendation that the administrative  and technical      personnel at  Koweit,  Bahrein,  &amp;c,  should  remain  under the control of the      Government  of  India, which  would continue  to be responsible  for questions  of      recruitment, &amp;c.:       40. (2.) Aden. The  existing civil  administration  of Aden is carried on  by  members of the Bombay Political Department, &amp;c,  numbering in all about twenty-five  officers:            41.  We  recommend that this administrative service should be taken over and      organized by the Colonial Office on the lines of, and  possibly as part of, similar      services under that department.      42. (3.) Mesopotamia. We understand that the technical services in Mesopo-  tamia will, in the main, be organized as part of the  Arab Government, and that officers  in  these  services  will not be in the employment  of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   We  have not  therefore made any recommendation as to these services.      43. (4.) Trans-Jordania.-We would suggest that it might at some later date  be found  convenient for the technical services in Trans-Jordania to be  administered as  part of the technical  services of  Palestine.      44. Advisers  and  Political  Officers. - Mesopotamia.   The   political  administration of Mesopotamia  is at present being carried out  by  officers who  have  been recruited  in a number of ways.   Some  officers have  b;en loaned  by other  Governments who are now pressing  for their return.  A considerable number of Army  officers have been seconded for definite periods.  There are also a great many temporary  officers who served in  the East during the war and  who are now engaged on a temporary  basis with contracts varying for the most part from one to three years.      We  understand  that  the High Commissioner estimates that 40 officers will be  required  in the immediate future  for political duties, but  that the number  may be  capable of subsequent reduction to 30.      45. We have considered whether it would be desirable to fix  a definite cadre and to  establish  a Mesopotamian  service on the lines of the Palestinian service.  We think  that such a  step  would hardly  be  consistent with  our obligations as  Mandatory for  Mesopotamia, and that the proper course  is for the civil administration - of Mesopotamia  to remain on a provisional footing.  Further, the number of  British officials required in  Mesopotamia is at the present moment decreasing, and  it seems  likely that  for some  time to come sufficient personnel of  the right quality will be  available on the spot.          46.  We  do  not  therefore recommend setting up a  Mesopotamian  service      or creating a pensionable establishment, uidess it becomes clear that the necessary      personnel is not obtainable on the special conditions recommended in paragraph 47.      Nor do we think it necessary to suggest any special method of recruitment.      47. It will, however, be necessary  to give  some security of  tenure to officers not  loaned from  parent services.   We approve  in principle the suggestion made by the  High Commissioner for Mesopotamia, that a certain  proportion of such officers should  be given 5 years&apos; engagements.   Instead  of a pension scheme we  suggest that it would  be  desirable to arrange  a  system of gratuities  payable  in respect of each completed  years  service, such gratuity being payable both to officers who are given 5 years&apos;  engagements  and to the margin of officers whom  it will be  necessary  to employ over.  and above those who are engaged  for the longer period.   The  details of this scheme  should be  worked out  between the Colonial Office and Treasury.      48. As  regards officers loaned  from  parent services, special  steps are essential to  secure the loan  of an adequate  number  of  experienced officials for as long as may be  necessary  to  fill a  proportion of  the more responsible posts.  The exact conditions of  engagement will  have to  be settled in each individual case, but we recommend  that  arrangements should be made in all cases to secure that service under the Mesopotamian administration will count for pension.     49. In addition to the Political Officers  required for  service in  Mesopotamia,  a certain number of officers will be  needed  to perform  similar duties in other areas.  We understand that there  are at present five officers engaged on such duties in Trans-Jordania but that it may be necessary to increase the number.  A certain number of officers will also be required for duty in the Aden Protectorate and on the Persian Gulf Littoral.     (8014-1)                                                                 B
    We are of the opinion that the officers who will be needed for political duties in these areas will have to possess the  same general qualifications as the Advisers and PoliticalOfficers in Mesopotamia.         50.  We therefore  recommend that  there should  be  one  body of &quot; Arab    Political Officers &quot; who should be  liable for service  in  any part  of the  territorial    sphere  of the new Department outside  Palestine.    We recommend  that the    arrangements which are  proposed  in  paragraphs 47 and  48  should  apply to this    body of officers as a whole. V. FORMATION  OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT  UNDER THE  COLONIAL                                     OFFICE.     51.  The last question which we have to deal with is &quot;the  formation of the new Department under the Colonial Office&quot;   ....  and the preparation of a time-table for the handing over to the Colonial Office of these new duties.     52.  From the definitions of the scope  of the new Department  which we  gave in paragraph 16 it is clear that the  new Department must contain sections or branches capable of dealing with  questions  of policy, administration and  finance.  The existing organization of the  Colonial Office, does not  provide the expert advice which the new Department will  require.   Political and administrative  questions  affecting the Arab areas demand a knowledge of local customs and language.  To effect the desired reduction in the  expenditure  which   has hitherto been incurred in connection  with the Arab countries, a very close scrutiny and control of local expenditure will  be necessary.  The formation of the special forces, referred  to in  paragraph  19, which  will be required if Imperial funds are to be relieved of the heavy cost of maintaining regular units  of the British or Indian armies in Mesopotamia  and Palestine will demand expert military advice.     53.  We assume that the  Secretary of  State  will exercise his  control  through an Under Secretary, and an Assistant  Under Secretary.  We do not  think that it is for us to  consider whether  either or  both of these officials will require to be specially appointed for the  purposes  of the  new Department, or whether  the duties  involved in the new  responsibilities of the Colonial  Office will be discharged  by  one or other of the existing  Under Secretaries  and Assistant Under Secretaries.  The point at which the political  and administrative, military, and financial branches should separate is, in our opinion,  immediately below the Assistant  Under Secretary.  There would be three sub-divisions, organized as follows :      (1.)  Political and Administrative          Palestine.         Mesopotamia.         Aden and Arabia.     (2.)  Military-         Relations with the War Office and  Air  Ministry  on  questions arising out of               the employment of regular British or Indian units.         Organization of local troops and consequent provision of British personnel.     (3.)  Financial.     54.  In addition to the above general outline technical advice may be required upon such subjects as  Muhammadan Law, Commerce, Public Works, &amp;c.     It will probably be found possible for this technical  advice  to  be  provided in themain by existing branches of the Colonial Office.         65. We recommend  that  in forming the political and administrative sub-     division of the new Department full use  should be made of  the services of officers     with local experience,  and that there should be free interchange between officers     serving at home and abroad.     56.  In Appendix A we present a diagram  showing in outline our  conception of the provisional organization  required to discharge  the functions that we have assigned
                 VI. SUMMARY  OF  RECOMMENDATIONS.     60. Territorial sphere of the New Department (paragraphs 2-15).         Subject to certain reservations  the  sphere  of the new Department to include     all the territories south and east of the newly defined boundary between the  French     mandated territories of Syria and the  British mandated territories of Palestine and     Mesopotamia (paragraph 6).         Reservations are made  as  regards Kurdistan (paragraph 8),  the Persian Gulf     littoral (paragraphs 9-12) and the Hedjaz (paragraphs 13-15).     61. Scope of  the  New Department (paragraphs  16-17). The Colonial Officeto become the responsible British authority on all matters  relating to :      (a.)  Administration and policy in Mesopotamia,  Palestine and Aden.     (b.) Policy in other Arab areas within the British sphere of influence.     (c.) The  delimitation of  boundaries between British spheres and  the territories of           independent Arab rulers.     (d.) All expenditure, whether civil or military, which may fall upon Imperial funds           as a result of British responsibility for and interest in the  areas concerned.        62. Military arrangements (paragraphs 18-33).        Relations between the  Colonial Office  and the War  Office and Air Ministry     (paragraphs 22-23).        The financial arrangements proposed to take effect as from the 1st April,  1921     (paragraph 27).        The High  Commissioner  in  Mesopotamia  to  have  the  titular  rank  of    Commander-in-Chief (paragraph 28).        The responsibility for  the  withdrawal of British forces  from  North-West    Persia to remain with the War Office  until this  force  has been withdrawn within    the boundaries of Mesopotamia (paragraph 31).        63. Civilian services.-The  Palestinian  service  to  remain distinct  from    other civilian services in the Middle East (paragraph 37).        The administration of the Persian Gulf littoral to remain  under the  control    of the Government of India (paragraph 39).tentatively to the new Department.   But it is clear that the accuracy of any estimateof numbers must depend upon the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in  the Arabiansphere, and the measure of control that it is proposed to  exercise from London over the actions of the authorities on the spot.   In any event we recommend that steps be taken immediately to  provide accommodation on an adequate scale in  order  to  avoid the dislocation that might otherwise be caused in the early days of the new organization.While it  is difficult to  make  any close estimate of the number  of officers required,we recommend  that  about twelve  to  fourteen  rooms should be made available to accommodate the staff of the new  Department.   The  necessary steps are  being  takenby the Office of Works in consultation with the Colonial  Office.     57. Decisions of great consequence will have to be taken  in the immediate futureby the Government  on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for the colonies and it is, in our opinion, essential  that he should have at his disposal an adequate staffdirectly the new responsibilities  are transferred to him, if British  expenditure in theMiddle East is to be reduced effectively.         58. We recommend that in the first instance the new Department should be    manned by officers loaned from parent Services and  that  no additional permanent    commitment should be incurred  until the future of the  new  Department can be    gauged with greater precision.    59. We anticipate that the  arrangements for securing the loan of the personnel from their parent services,  and for obtaining the accommodation  required, should becompleted by the 1st March next.        We therefore recommend that the transfer of the new responsibilities to the    Colonial Office should become effective upon that date.
    Aden to be taken over by the Colonial Office (paragraph 41).    No separate permanent establishment to be created for the Mesopotamia!!service (paragraph 46), but one body of &quot; Arab Political Officers,&quot; liable for service in any part of the  territorial sphere  of the new Department  outside Palestine(paragraph 50).    64. Formation of the New Department. The  new Department to  bemanned in the first instance by officers loaned from parent services (paragraph 58).    In forming the  New Department  full use to be made  of officers with localexperience (paragraph 55).    The transfer of the new responsibilities to the Colonial Office to become effectiveon the 1st March next (paragraph 59).                               J. E.
