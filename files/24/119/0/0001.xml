THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.                              CABINET*    PROPOSALS FOR CONTINUING Tim WORK OF ESTABLISHING TRADE BOARDS.   ,                     MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR *IET   31.       lt  On consideration of a memorandum submitted by my predecessor  on 15th November, 1919,  (CP. 129) the Cabinet approved the expenditure  of a sum of  20,000 on  additional temporary staff for the purpose of  establishing Trade Boards to cover those trades in which no machinery  exists for the effective regulation of wages.  This sum will shortly be  exhausted, and I submit the following proposal for the expenditure of a  sum when war-bonus   is included approximately the same during the next  year .   I understand that this proposal is considered to involve new  expenditure and thus to require the sanction of the Cabinet.           At that date It was hoped that the staff then provided would -  be adequate for the work involved in the  stablishment of 100 Trade  Boardst  It has, howevor, been found that, owin , to the complexities  of many of the trades,  of the desirability of securing general agree-  merit before Boards were set up, and the difficulty of training a new  staff rapidly, the number which could be set up in the period in ques-  tion was only 33.           In addition to tie work involved in the actual constitution of  new Trade Boards, there has further been a heavy volume of work in two  directions^           A. The investigation of conditions in trades where an exten-  sion of the scope of an existing Trade Board had been pressed upon me,  both by the Trade Board itself and by the Unions in immediately kindred grades.   The four Boards to *which special attention has been given are.            The Sugar Confectionery Trade Board,            The Stamped and Press Metal Wares Prade Board, and            The Tin Box and                Hollow-ware Trade Boards.
In order to complete the organisation of these Boards enquirieshave been &quot;,ade into some 21 trades which are set out at &quot;A&quot;  in theattached Appendix.         Be  In addition enquiries have been made into 15 tradesxwhere an undertaking had been given to investigate with a view todiscovering whether there was a case for the setting up of a trade board or of a Joint Industrial Council.  In both these cases the enquiries are not complete and a great deal of additional workremains to be done if the work already done is not to be wasted.     2.  In the meantime the policy of the extension of Trade Boardswas accepted by the Government as the only possible alternative tpa universal flat minimum wage, and later to the extension of theWages (Temporary Regulation) Act y/hich expired at the end of last september.  On numerous occasions, both in Parliament and atconferences, statements have been made on behalf of the Governmentto this effect.  It must further be remembered that the minimum wage  (Commission) Bill, which WBB recommended by the ProvisionalJoint Committee of the National Industrial Conference in 1919, and accepted by the Government, has been introduced and that theGovernment are still u&quot;der pledge to proceed with it.  I share my predecessor^ view that to proceed with this Bill would haveundesirable results.  It is, however, plain to me, especially havingregard to the latest manifesto of the Labour Party on the subjectof reduction of wages, that they will not be prepared to let thismatter rest unless the Government can continue to present the substantial alternative afforded by the extension of Trade Boards.         5.  I am aware that considerable criticism  (increasingrecently in volume and emphasis) Is being directed against theestablishment of Irade Boards on the  round,  among others, thattheir establishment tends to increase unemployment.   This criticisex &quot;B&quot; on attached Appendix.
of course has boon the sto^-^IN-^trade of all opponents of everyattempt to reform unsatisfactory wages conditions in the past, andhas so far always shown itself to be unfounded.  I am watching ittoday with close  care.   If it now be well founded we are ofcourse, in our endeavour to improve conditions,defeating our ownobject.         4.  While-, therefore, I regard the criticism in general aspart of the attack on the Government, I am fully conscious of thenecessity ir. the interests of the system of Trade Boards itself,to which I attach the greatest importance, that we should proceed as slowly AS IS compatible both with our commitments and with theneeds of the situation.         My predecessor and myself have given  certain specificpledges in respect of A number of trades in Parliament and furtherpledges have been given by ny Department in accordance with thegeneral policy during the present year.         The Trades in respect of which these  promises have beengiven are 53 In all, but in some cases, in view of pledges that have been made, it will be necessary to set up separate Boafcdsfor Scotland.  It should, however, be understood that it does not follow that there will necessarily be a separate Board for eachof the trades, because experience may  show that what appears to beA separate trade can in fact, and should be, grouped  with one ormore other trades.         A list of these trades is given in the Appendix at &quot;C&quot;.         5.  The position therefore is that, In order to carry outpromises, it is necessary to continue the investigations and thework in respect of the trades in which enquiry has been made, Inorder to remedy the existing definition of Trade Boards and in orderto set up-Boards in trades where Boards do not exist.   In addition
there is the fact that a considerable sum of money,  calculated  to amount to some  8,000, has been spent on preliminary investigationsin other trades which would be wasted if the investigation is nowinterrupted as conditions change 90 rapidly that what has been discovered in the immediate past will be of little value after  thepassage of some months%         Moreover, apart from these considerations,  it is vital that there should be staff available to ma.:e the necessary invest!-gations in respect of the Boards already set up, with a view to securing that they achieve the purpose for which they are intended,and to keep up with the fluctuation In the structure of industry,which is particularly marked at this time of reconstruction.         6*  I have anxiously reviewed the position, bearing inmind the possible reactions at this time on Employment of a toouncompromising prosecution of Trade Board policy and the paramountneed for economy in administrations.  I am, however, convinced thatto stop the programme abruptly now would not merely be a breach of faith impossible to justify, but would, from the general industrialpoint of view, be a false step.     The amending Act of 1918 wasexpressly passed in order to provide effective wage regulation forthe  period  of depression which it was anticipated would follow uponthe  War,         Experience in  the past shows that there is no more fruit-ful  source  of general discontent than that  caused by the existenceof a large  pool of entirely underpaid labour.  With the prevailingunrest, due to widespread unemployment, it  is above all necesaarythat the Government should not appear to be a party to any generalpolicy  for  depressing wages where wages are indisputably inadequate.                                m 4 **
         7.  I have fully considered the proposal and I  askfc.  sanction for a further  25,000 for the work of investigationduring the current year.  If In the course of the work I can find any means of reducing it ia extent, I shall of coursedo so, and  shall In any case personally watch its progress with great care.
