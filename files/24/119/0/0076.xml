(Received 0 p.ni.)     Clear the line.     182 8.   Following from Dobbs, No. 31 0., dated 7th February :-     &quot; In reply to statements and arguments advanced by me at private meeting ou2nd February, Tarsi has written a rather acrimonious note denying breach of faith,expressing readiness to publish all correspondence, reiterating  right of tribes to self-determination, emphasising justice of  draft clause 8, declaring that  Afghans do not wish to reject British offer of friendship unless forced to do so, as  they recognisetheir dependence on Indian trade, and  inviting me to put forward a draft of my own.On the wdiole, drift seems to give slight indication of  retreat, while  making  it plain that it is essential to save the face of  Afghanistan.  I am ordering up  motors, as i must be in a position to leave Kabul immediately on collapse of the negotiations.   Inthe meantime. I shall have  private  meeting with Tarsi in next few days, in accordancewith his  invitation already given, and  shall put forward, as  maximum  possibleconcession to Afghan sentiment, following proposals : Afghan  clause  1.   Add  afterthe  words &apos; external independence&apos; the words &apos; within their  respective boundariesas accepted under the  treaty signed at Rawalpindi on the 8th August 1919.&apos;  Afghan.clause 8.   Substitute following clause: &apos; The two high contracting  parties havingmutually  satisfied themselves,  each regarding goodwill  of the other, and especiallyregarding  their  joint  benevolent  intentions  towards tribes residing close  to  theirrespective spheres,  hereby  undertake each to inform the other in  future  of  any measures which may appear necessary  for the maintenance of order amongst frontiertribes residing within  their respective  spheres before  the taking of such measures.Further, with a view  to maintenance  of  harmony on their  frontiers, the  two highcontracting parties agree that there-shall in future be a periodical exchange  of visitsbetween respective frontier officers, as  Avill be subsequently laid  down in  detail,  forthe purpose of exchange of views regarding best means of preserving peace of frontier and  regarding betterment, of  the tribes  of  Afghan origin  in whose  welfare  thesentiment  of the Afghan  nation  has  always  been closely  interested.   The  AfghanGovernment declares on its part that, in view  of the foregoing stipulation, it is satisfiedthat it need no longer  entertain apprehension  that undue severity will  be  exercised by the  British  Government  towards tribes residing  within  the British (one groupundecipherable)   which  rose  against the British  Government  during the recentregrettable war between the two high contracting parties in retaliation for any actionswhich the said tribes (? may have)  taken during the said war.&apos;  Proposals end.  I donot think that this will commit us  to anything, and it may possibly  be acceptable toAfghans.  If the Government of  India disapprove,  please  inform me  urgently.   Ishall inform Tarsi at private meeting that suggestion  has not  yet received  approvalof my Government.&quot;     Our comments follow.                           i
