            King&apos;s Speech on the  Opening of Parliament.tail   u MY  LORDS AND MEMBERS OF  THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,     My relations with  Foreign Powers  continue to be  of  a friendly  nature. Conferences will  be  held at  an  early date in London, which will be attended by Our Allies in the late war and  also by representatives of  Germany and Turkey. I earnestly trust that by this means  further progress will  be made  in giving effect  to the Treaties of Peace, in re-establishing concord in Europe  and in restoring tranquillity in the Near East.  It is My hope  that the negotiations for a trade agreement with Russia will also be brought to a successful conclusion.     The  Duke of Connaught has inaugurated the new Councils in India, and I pray that the assumption by  My subjects in India of new political responsibilities may secure progress in  administration and an  early appeasement of political strife.     The  policy  of  My  Government in  regard  to  Egypt, following  upon  the investigations of  the Special  Mission appointed in  1919, will be laid before  you.     I am glad to say that arrangements have been made to renew  that personal consultation between My Ministers here and  their colleagues overseas, which  pro- duced such good  results during the last two years of the war and during the Peace settlement.  I hope that the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia,  New Zealand, the  Union of South Africa and Newfoundland, as well as representatives of India, will be able to visit this country during the coming summer.  I am confident that the  discussions to take place during their visits will be of the utmost value in bringing  about   co-ordination both  in  the  external  and internal  policy  of  the Empire. MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE  OF  COMMONS,     The estimates for the Services in the  coming  year will be laid  before you in due course, and these estimates  will reflect the determination of the Government to reduce expenditure to the lowest level consistent with the well-being of the Empire.  The war has left upon the nation  liabilities which can  only be  met by heavy taxation, but  it is imperative in the  interest of  an early revival of trade and industry that this burden should be reduced to the utmost.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    The situation  in Ireland  still causes me  distress.  A misguided section ofthe Irish people persist in resorting  to methods of criminal violence with  theobject of establishing an independent Republic.  Neither Irish unity nor Irishself-government can  be attained by this means.  The arrangements  for bringing into force the Government of Ireland  Act are now well advanced, and I earnestlytrust  that  in the  near future the  majority of  the  people will  show their determination to repudiate  violence and to work  an  Act  which confers upon them the responsibilities of self-government and provides the machinery wherebythey can attain to Irish unity by constitutional means.    In view of the onerous programme of legislation  which was set before  youduring last year, it is the intention of  My Ministers  to lighten as far  as possiblethe business of the coining Session.  The most pressing problem which confrontsyou is that of unemployment, consequent upon  a world-wide restriction  of trade,and this may be alleviated, but  cannot be cured, by  legislative means. this problem, with its acute and distressing consequences for hundreds of thousands ofour fellow-citizens, is receiving the constant and anxious attention of My ministers with the object both  of reviving trade and prosperity and  in the meantime of assisting those  who are unfortunately unemployed.   You will  be invited topass a  Bill extending the  provision  which  is  made for the unemployed underthe Unemployment  Insurance Act.   A measure will  also  be introduced  into      [5617]  &apos;
the House of Commons to deal with the safeguarding of essential key industries of  the  country and  with  certain aspects  of  unfair  and  abnormal industrialcompetition.   I earnestly trust that these efforts will be seconded  by loyal and frank  co-operation between employers  and  employed,  for  it  is  through theco-operation of capital and labour in a spirit of mutual trust and confidence thatan early solution of this grave problem is to be found.    It is proposed that  the  forthcoming removal of control over the home price and export quantities of coal shall be followed at the earliest possible moment bythe complete restoration of the industry to its normal condition of freedom.    In accordance with the intention expressed in the Ministry of Transport Act,a Bill will  be submitted to  you for the  reorganisation  of the railways of GreatBritain.    Bills will be laid  before you dealing with the completion of land purchase inIreland, and also for facilitating Church union in Scotland.    A Bill will also be presented  dealing with the  sale of alcoholic liquor in thelight of the experience gained during the war.    My Ministers  further trust that the work of the Committee now examining the question of the Reform of the Second Chamber will be  finished in  time topermit  of  proposals  being  submitted to Parliament during the  course of thepresent Session.    And I  pray the blessing of Almighty God rest upon your deliberations.
