This  document is the property of His  Britannic Majesty V GovernmentSECRET. &apos;CP. 2549.                               THE CABINET.CANTEEN  TRADING.103MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR  WAR.Gen. No. 2450    My previous Memorandum upon this subject (CP. 2224), of 3rd December, referred in its last paragraph to the forthcoming report of the Inter-Departmental Committee    5gwhich was constituted  to consider  the  future  organization of canteens for  the three &quot;Gen. No,Services.                                                                           2325      This Committee has now issued  its report, and I circulate to my colleagues the relevant paragraph which touches upon  the  relation  of Canteens  to Private Trading,and which embodies the views of the War Office thereon.                                                                     w.  s. c.    THE WAR OFFICE,           8 th February, 1921.         EXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF THE REORGANIZATION COMMITTEE.        &quot; Relation of the Navy and Army Canteen Board, to private trading.     While not perhaps strictly  within  the  terms of their reference,  the  Committeedesire to bring to notice the  fact that there appears to be a feeling in garrison townsthat  the present trading  activities  of the  Navy  and Army Canteen  Board  aretrespassing unfairly upon the  province of general trade and commerce.     Various Trading Organizations have expressed their views  on this  subject at twodeputations which have  been  received by Sir Archibald Williamson in the War Office,and  have attacked  the present trading  of the Navy  and Army  Canteen  Boardsomewhat bitterly, but they have not hitherto been able to  suggest any plan of traderestriction which could be accepted.     It is contended  that simply to desist from opening  canteens or shops on any landnot belonging to the Service  Departments does not  fully meet the real case, which isconcerned with the scope of trading done or which  may be done.   It is alleged that  thecanteens have unfair advantages  from the State, that it is in effect State trading, thatthe articles dealt in have greatly extended in number and  class, and that the list ofprivileged purchasers is  too wide.  The Committee are of opinion that  the advantagesare exaggerated and are largely counter-balanced by the necessity of opening a separatecanteen for each  unit, even when in the same  camp, and  by the pressure, if not more,to open canteens and  recreation  rooms in places  where there may be only smalldetachments of troops and where the canteens  cannot pay, that there is nearly alwaysactive   competition,  that the articles supplied  are  to meet  a demand,  that it is impracticable to  draw a  line as to where the requirements of a  soldier and his familybegin and end,  that  in some stations the soldier and his family depend upon  thecanteen for almost  everything, and  that the  list of privileged purchasers is strictly&apos;limited by regulations.     These observations apply  with particular force to the circumstances of the Armyand Air Force and  in some degree  to the Navy.  Incidently, it may be rememberedthat supplies are not  sold  at  bare  cost.   Beyond  operating expenses,  wages andoverhead charges, which have to be  covered, there is in  addition a loading which atpresent  is 10  per  cent.  Of this, in  the case of the  Army, 8 per cent,  is returned tothe funds of  the  unit to provide facilities for healthy  recreation such  as games andsports, and 2 per cent, is allocated to the Central Funds Committee,  which makes    (1321/80)  100 2/21  H&amp;S,Ltd 8932wo
grants to  military  institutions  which  exist  for  the  benefit of  the  soldier.   TheCommittee  are  informed  that it  will not  be possible,  on the volume  of peace-timetrading and having regard to the scattered units for  whom it is necessary to cater, tocontinue  the rebate at this percentage; it will  be necessary to  reduce it, and if thebusiness were by order to be still further restricted, apart from the disadvantage to the soldier, this loss of revenues to provide for his healthy  enjoyment  would render  the life of the serving man less attractive.     The Committee are of the opinion  that, while t*he list  of privileged purchasersshould be carefully scrutinized and strictly adhered to,  the scope of trading should beleft to the discretion of the Council and  Board of Management, who must necessarily be  guided  by  the  circumstances  of  the locality,  and influenced by the  demand orotherwise for various articles.     As the complaint  has been publicly  made,  although originating probably from a relatively small number of persons, and as it may, perhaps, be considered a matter ofpolicy for the Cabinet to decide, the Committee have thought it desirable to bring thematter to notice along with their opinion  upon it.&quot;
