nent is  the  Property of His  Britannic  Majesty &apos;s  Government. J   CP   2569   )   J Printed for the Cabinet   Feh *uary 1921,y              -  ^  CONFIDENTIAL.[W 1364/115/50MEMORANDUM.    AMONG the many delects in our national organisation that were brought intoprominent notice by the war was the very noticeable  lack of cohesion and aptitude for common action among British subjects resident in  foreign countries.   The necessityfor combating German commerce and influence in neutral countries during the war ledto a marked improvement in these respects, and in order to prevent a relapse into theformer conditions, and also  in order to meet the constant complaints that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are indifferent  to the welfare  of British  subjects abroad, I appointed aCommittee last summer to  consider and  advise what policy it would be desirable forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt in these matters in the future.    2. The Committee  presented a unanimous report, which has been published andaccorded an exceptionally favourable reception in the British press.  To some of therecommendations effect has or will  be given by departmental action.  There remains,however, the most important recommendation of all, Le., that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould grant financial assistance for educational purposes abroad.  This recommendation was based on the following grounds :     (1.) Where the members of a British community by their enterprise and industry           are extending British trade, wealth and influence, they earn  the right to a           British education  for their children, even though they may make no direct           contribution to Imperial taxation.    (2.) It is against the material and moral  interests  of  the  Empire as a whole that           the children of British parents abroad should be allowed to grow up as           foreigners, with  the feelings and sympathies of aliens, and that the position           of English as the language of  commerce over the greater part of the globe           should be exposed to open challenge.    3. The Committee also recommended the appointment of a permanent StandingCommittee to advise generally and  to  administer any Government money allotted for educational and other  similar purposes.    4. The report was communicated to the Treasury for their observations.  In replythey state  that they can  hold out no hope that  Government funds will be available for assisting British educational or other institutions abroad, and they see no use therefore in appointing a representative on the proposed Standing Committee.    5. Without Government money the recommendations of the Committee cannot becarried out  except to a negligible extent.  The forthcoming Conference  of  BritishChambers of Commerce  intend  to  demand what are the intentions of  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and the question is sure to be raised at any early date in both Houses ofParliament and in the press.  It seems to me, in these circumstances, to be a matter for Cabinet decision whether the general principle of refusal of Government aid shouldbe maintained and the proposals of the Committee shelved, or whether we should adopt,within reasonable limits, a more  generous policy.  In  the  former event, we must beprepared for attacks in Parliament and the press, to which financial stringency and thegeneral need for economy will be the only, but not, I think, an adequate, reply.    6. Quite recently I circulated  to the Cabinet a &quot;  Memorandum on French policy with regard to Propaganda in Foreign Countries,&quot; in which it was pointed out that theBudget Commission of the French Chamber of Deputies attach so much  importance to proposals of the kind advocated by the British Committee, that they have  recommended vote on  that account of 26,000,000 fr., on the ground that it  is only by judiciousexpenditure on such  objects that  France  can  re-establish her  overseas  trade and increase her political prestige in foreign countries.       98   [5602J
     7. An allocation of even so modest  a sum as  100,000/,  per annum for a termof years, to be spent on the support of British institutions in foreign countries, would allow of the proposed Standing  Committee being set up, and would, 1 think, satisfypublic opinion.    This  sum  would  be  expended  on  the  advice of  the  StandingCommittee, on  which  the presence  of a  Treasury representative  would  supply asufficient safeguard against extravagance.                                                                     0.  OF K.    Foreign Office,         February 9, 1921.
