/(P (507)        From Secretary of Stale to Viceroy, Foreign Department,                                1st January 1921.     Clear the line.     600.  Your  telegram  ot 27th  January, 129 S.  Afghanistan.  In  view oi  yourinstructions to Dobbs, which 1  approve, it  is  unnecessary for  me  to comment  onAfghan  demands.     With reference to opening  sentence of proposed communications  to Afghans, I doubt wisdom of indicating to  them  possibility of different shades  of view between his Majesty&apos;s Government and Government of India.  Please bear this in mind.
