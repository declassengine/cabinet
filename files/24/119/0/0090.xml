o    CP.   2 5This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1921.CONFIDENTIAL.THE EGYPTIAN SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I MUST ask the Cabinet to come to an early (preliminary) decision on the subjectof Egypt. It cannot indeed either in honour or with safety be delayed. Acting uponthe instructions of the Cabinet at our last meeting on the subject (4th January), Iforwarded a copy of Lord Milner&apos;s report to Lord Allenby on the 6th January. Inmy covering despatch I said that we proposed to lay Lord Milner&apos;s report beforeParliament at the opening of the session, that it should be simultaneously published inEgypt, that an advance copy should be given to the Sultan, and that the latter shouldbe invited to constitute the long-promised official delegation which was to come toEngland to discuss the terms with His Majesty&apos;s Government. I added, in accordancewith the Cabinet decision : &quot; Both parties will enter the discussion with free hands, since, pending theexchange of views to which I have referred, His Majesty&apos;s Government have notthought it right to arrive at a final judgment on either the principle or the detailsof the proposals contained in the report.&quot;Then ensued a telegraphic correspondence with Lord Allenby, which has beencirculated to the Cabinet in the printed collection of telegrams, and the salient featuresof which have been the following: From the start Lord Allenby expressed himself as confident (12th January) thatbefore the Sultan agreed to form an official delegation he would require certainexplanations as to the general attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that anyvery wide modification of the principles of Lord Milners proposals would be regardedby all shades of opinion as a breach of faith on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; Egypt,&quot; he said, &quot; expects a declaration of policy by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentbased on Lord Milner&apos;s conversations, and then to be called upon to produce adelegation to discuss details of settlement.&quot;While urging this course of action, which he has since emphasised and repeated,Lord Allenby did not conceal his own opinion that in certain respects His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be well advised, when the Egyptian delegation comes to England,in insisting upon certain substantial modifications of. Lord Milner&apos;s concrete proposals.They are the very respects in which I have in previous papers myself criticisedthem, viz. :-(a.) The control of foreign affairs, as to which Lord Allenby thinks we shouldnot acquiesce in the appointment by the Egyptian Government ofdiplomatic representatives in foreign capitals,(b.) The right to maintain British troops in other places than the Canal zone,notably in the neighbourhood of Cairo,(c.) The position and functions of the financial and judicial advisers.(d.) The non-employuient of foreigners in the Egyptian civil and military servicesexcept with the assent of the British representative.In subsequent telegrams Lord Allenby has added criticisms or has suggestedamendments on other points which would be appropriately discussed with the Egyptiandelegation when it arrives.The Sultan, when he had read Lord Milner&apos;s report, took exactly the line whichLord Allenby had foreseen. He said that, while entirely willing to meet our views,he could not form the delegation without a much more definite basis than the purelynegative attitude so far assumed by &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government: A little later(29th January) the Sultan formulated on his own account a fresh objection to the109   [5634]
Milner proposals, viz., that the responsibility of the Council of Ministers to theLegislative Assembly would, in his opinion and that of many leading Egyptianpoliticians, be at present a dangerous experiment, leading to intrigue. But herepeatedly insisted that &quot;it would be impossible for him to nominate an officialdelegation until His Majesty&apos;s Government come to a definite decision which wouldform a basis for discussion.&quot;This, then, is the point at which we have arrived. If we mean to keep our pledgeas to the delegation (and it is unthinkable that we should not), if we want to settle, theEgyptian question peaceably and to escape a revival of controversy and agitation verylikely in a much more dangerous form, we cannot procrastinate indefinitely, or waittill the Dominion Premiers arrive in June to help us to make up our minds, but mustcome to some prefatory decision without delay.   What form should it take ?Lord Allenby, whose official telegrams, as well as his private correspondence,demonstrate that his views are substantially identical with those which I have morethan once placed before the Cabinet, has supplied us with a formula (17th January).It is that we should forthwith make the following declaration to the Sultan : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government, after a study of the proposals made by LordMilner, have arrived at the conclusion that the status of protectorate is not asatisfactory relation in which Egypt should continue to stand to Great Britain.While they have not reached final decisions with regard to Lord Milner&apos;srecommendations, they desire to confer regarding them with an official delegation,nominated by the Sultan with a view, if possible, to substitute for the protectoratea treaty of alliance which would, while securing the special interests of GreatBritain and enabling her to offer adequate guarantees to foreign Powers, meet thelegitimate aspirations of Egypt and the Egyptian people.&quot;I am not wedded to these precise words. But they represent in substance thetwo principles which, while sharply criticising some of Lord Milner&apos;s proposals, Iasked the Cabinet to accept in my note of the 1st January, viz., (a) the substitution ofa treaty of alliance for the existing but disputed protectorate, and (b) the recognitionwithin certain defined limits of the independence of Egypt.If we are prepared to go as far as Lord Allenby proposes, then I believe, andLord Allenby concurs with me, that when the delegation comes here we shall be ableto exact pretty well what terms we desire about the disputed points, and even to insistupon the control of foreign relations. We shall also be able to take up a firm lineabout the Zaghlul reservations, which of course we shall be willing to discuss pari passuwith the discussion by the Egyptians of our objections, but about which I hope thatwe shall decline to give way. In other words we should have made our maximumconcession, and if we did not obtain the terms that we desired would then revert tothe status quo ante. If we do not, adopt some such line, but take refuge in furtherdelay, we shall be acting in direct opposition to the emphatic and repeated advice ofthe Sultan, of Lord Allenby, of Lord Milner, and indeed of everyone J. have met orheard from who is acquainted with the present position in Egypt; we shall obtain nodelegation; Adly and Mazloum, who is to be president of the delegation, will decline toserve upon it (vide Lord Allenby&apos;s telegram of 19th January), and we shall be back inthe quicksands. It is too late now to act as though Lord Milner had never existed, oras though his report had not been written, or was not about to be given to the world.As a matter of fact the Egyptians are giving us a great opportunity by the super-stitious and almost insane significance which they attach to the phrase protectorate.In their eyes it connotes servitude of a degrading character, inconsistent with theglorious Wilsonian discovery of self-determination as the future guiding principle ofmankind. Why should we not humour them ? Why worry about the rind if we canobtain the fruit ? I take it that what we all have in view is that Egypt would remaininside rather than outside the British Imperial system. If the best way to do this is todrop the word protectorate and conclude a treaty of alliance with her, as we did withthe Indian Princes a century ago (their relation to us has indeed been commonlydefined by the constitutional writers as one of &quot; subordinate alliance &quot;), why not do it ?My advice therefore is : 1. That we should now make up our minds to go as far as Lord Allenby proposes,and invite the Sultan to appoint and send the delegation on that basis.2. That we should have an early discussion in Parliament. Indeed, we cannotescape it at. which we should, without committing ourselves to anyacceptance in detail, lay down the above general propositions, and inviteopinions as to detail.
5593. That when the delegation comes we should press for and even insist upon ourconditions, which, in my belief, we shall obtain.May I add this final reflection, that if we do not take this &quot;opportunity to settlethe Egyptian problem on lines which, though we might not a priori have chosenthem, are yet compatible with the retention of British predominance in Egypt, wemay find that a British Labour or Socialist Government at no very distant date maygrant complete independence and sacrifice oui position altogether ?(Initialled)        C. of KFebruary 14, 1921.The War Office have submitted to the Foreign Office certain criticisms of detailupon Lord Mimer&apos;s proposals, which could be considered by a committee or conferencebefore the discussion with the Egyptian delegates begins.
