CENSUS (f PRODUCTION (1920)./      IJIhORANDUL BY THE PRISTONT OF            THE BOARD OF TRADE.     I desire to bring before the Cabinet the circumstancesoonneoted with proposals made by the ^oard of Tradeto take immediately a partial Census of Productionin respect of the output of factories ^ c. in 1920.     Early in 1919 the Board of Trade determined thatsuoh a Census should be taken, and in December 1919 they approved a draft Order prescribing the trades to whichthe Census was to be limited.   The draft Order was laid before the Treasury with a statement that the totalcost of the Census, so far as could then be estimated,would be i&apos;50.000.   The Treasury approved and the order was accordingly made on 22nd December, 1919, it beingneoessary under the provisions of the Census of production-tion Acts that there should be at least a yearrs interval between the date on which the Order is made and theoommenooment of the year in which the Census is to betaken.   4 copy of the Order is attached.     On 22nd November, 1920, a letter was addressed tothe Ereasury requesting approval of a further and completeCensus to be taken In 1922 in respect of productioncarried on in 1921.   It was stated in the letter thatit had been found possible to reduce the estimate of thecost of the partial Census for 1920 from  50,000 to under 30,000.   On 23rd December a reply was received from theTreasury intimating that expenditure on a Census inrespeot of 1921 could not be sanctioned and that it wouldbe necessary that the partial Census in respect of 1920should be abandoned.   The Board replied to* theICreasury on 24th December stating that, in theiropinion, it was desirable to proceed with this Censusin view of the following reasons and, of the fact thatthe sum involved was relatively small: -      1. The Statutory Order for this Census was   made in December, 1919, and preparations for   taking the Census are far advanced.   Draft schedules   for the 36 trades to which the Order relates have   been circulated to Trade -associations and Chambers   of Commerce,  their criticisms and recommendations   have been considered, a register of firms to whom   schedules are to be issued has been compiled and   arrangements for such issue are in active progress.   In these circumstances the ^oard submit that it may   be considered that the enquiry is actually in opera-   tion.   The Federation of British Industries and   other Associations of Employers have been in communi-   cation with their constituent members as to the manner   in which the detailed information specified in the   Schedules should be furnished, and it is to be   assumed, therefore, that manufacturers are now putting
    themselves  in a petition to  supply  che particulars   -promptly, m advantage  which will he  entirely lost if    the  Census  is postponed.  Proofs ior  ohe prints for    the  various trades  have already been  passed, but print-    ing  off has not begun.      2.   There is at  present no adequate information as    to the  condition of the countryTs industries in    comparison  with the pre-war  position.  Owing to changes    in values of commodities, and in some industries    changes  in  organisation and  in the nature of the    goods produced by individual firms, the pre-war   position affords  no  basis for estimating present    conditions  and it is considered to be a matter of   pressing importance  that sufficient information   with regard  to  the post-war  position should be made   available as  early  as practicable.   The 1920 Census   while not covering  all  industries, has been planned   on a scale sufficiently wide to enable reasonably   reliable estimates to be made for industry as a whole   and:;to yield much essential  information of use both   to Departments  and to the Government as a whole   respecting the  output of commodities, the numbers   oi persons employed, and the mechanical equipment   of the factories  engaged in  their production.      3.  Both  ior administrative purposes,  and also   for the  determination of policy,  it is necessary to   knew the facts  regarding particular industries and   also the condition oi manufacturing industry as a   whole.   Such information, which can only be obtained   through  the medium of a Census  of Production,  would   appear to be of importance not  only to the Board of   Trade, but also to the  Treasury,  the Ministry of   Labour and other Public Departments.      4,  The Board have be^n oi opinion that in the   rapidly  changing  conditions of  industry it was desir-   able that continuous information should be collected   throughout the  reconstruction period,  and for that   reason they proposed that in addition to  the partial   Census relating to 1920, a complete Census of production-   tion should be  taken in 1922 in respeot of 1921.   In   view, however,  of the Cabinet&apos;s decision *chey are now   disposed to agree that,  provided that  they are enabled   to make current estimates on the  basis of a Census,   relating to  1920, the next succeeding Census should   be postponed.     The Treasury, however, in a letter dated 10thJanuary ,1920,  replied that they were unable  to make provision for the  carrying out of  the  partial Census ior1920.     In accordance with Treasury Circular oi 17th December,1920, (P.2355)I desire to reruest that  the Cabinet willauthorise the necessary expenditure  for that partialCensus.     A copy of the correspondence  between &apos;che Board ofTrade and the Treasury is  attached.R.3.H.2*2.1921.

Sir,     I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty1s Treasury your letter of the 24th ultimo (E.38956), requesting that the partial Census ofProduction in respect of the year 1920 should beallowed to proceed.     In reply I am to request you to inform theBoard of,,Trade that My Lords remain unable to make provision for the carrying out of this partial Censusfor 1920.   If the Board so desire,  they will no doubtsubmit the matter to the Cabinet in tho manner in-dicated in Treasury Circular of the  17th ultimo (P.S355),I am, Sir,     Your obedient Servant,(Sgd )   R.S,  MBIKDEJOHN..The Secretary!

The Statutory Order Tor this Census was made  in     December, 1919, and preparations for taking the Census     are  far advanced.   Draft schedules have been circulated j     to Trade Associations and Chambers of Commerce, their     criticisms and recommendations have been considered, a     register of firms to whom schedules are to be issued has     been compiled and arrangements for such issue are  in     active progress.   In these circumstancos the Board     submit that it may be considered that the enquiry  is     actually in operation.   The Federation of British     Industries and other Associations of Employers have been     in communication with their constituent members as to     the manner in which the detailed information specified     in the Schedules should be furnished, and it is to be     assumed, therefore, that manufacturers are now putting     themselves in a position to supply the particulars     promptly, an advantage which will be entirely lost if     the Census is postponed.     2.   There is at present no adequate information as to     the condition of the country1s industries in comparison     with the pre-war position.   Owins to changes in values     of commodities and in some industries changes in organi-     sation and in the nature of the goods produced by  indi-     vidual firms the pro-war position affords no basis for     estimating present conditions and it is considered to be     a matter of pressing importance that sufficient informa-     tion with regard to the post-war position should be made     available as early as practicable.    The 1920 Census,     while not covering all industries,  will be sufficiently     wide to enable reasonably reliable estimates to be made     for industry as a whole and will yield much essential     information of use both to Departments and to the     Government as a whole respecting the output of commodities,     tho numbers of persons employed and the engine equipment     of the factories engaged in their production.Copy.  15. 38956.3.   Quite apart from information as to the condition ofmanufacture as a whole the proposed Census will yieldinformation rofrardiner particular industries which it isnecessary for the Board to possess for their administra-tive purposes, and foil placing s,t the disposal of theGovernment information in connection with the directionof policy in dealing with current rroblems.   Questionsfrequently arise -which cannot be properly considered forwant of particulars as to the output of one or othersrroups of industries,   Por example, information was re-quired for the purposes of tho debate on the ForeignDyestuffs (Import Reflation) Bill now before Parliament,as to the use of Dyes, i.e., a statement was wanted of                                                 the/
the  quantities of soods subjected to dyeing or colouringprocesses.   In  default of a recent enquiry into production a roush estimate had to be made on the basisof pre-war figures and such an estimate could only bein the nature of an intelligent sruess.   It was accord-in^ly deemed inadvisable to make the figures public, asthey mierht perhaps be misleading owinf? to the consider-able element of uncertainty which existed.   Anotherrecent   illustration is afforded by an enquiry receivedfrom the Cabinet who wished to know what would be theeffect on industry, as a whole, of a strike in any one -of the most important industries.   Here, again, the lack of recent production figures was seriously felt.The  bearing on British industry of proposals for the alteration of foreign tariffs can only be imperfectlycaused in the absence of recent statistics of home production, taken in conjunction with those relating toforeign trade, and, similarly, it is equally difficultto estimate the effects of any extension of duties onthe  imports of soods into the United Kingdom.   It is submitted that information of this character would beno less useful to the Treasury, the Ministry of labourand  other Departments of State dealina: with matters ofpolicy and administration.4.   The Board have been of opinion that in the rapidlychanging: conditions of industry it was desirable thatcontinuous information should be collected throughoutthe reconstruction period, and for that reason they proposed that in addition to the partial Census relatingto 1920, a complete Census of Production should be takenin 1922 in respect of 1921.   In view, however, of theCaiaiBietTs decision they are now disposed to agree thatthe Census relating to 1921 should be postponed providedthat they are enabled to make current estimates on thebasis of a Census relating to 1920.   If the lords commissioners concur they will be glad to discuss thematter further with a view to determining the year forwhich the first post-war Census of all productiveindustries should be taken.I am,  Sir,   Your obedient Servant,     (Sgd)  H.

TREASURY ORj^BRRS,     23rd Deaember, 192Sir,     I have laid before the Lords Commissioners cfHis hajesty&apos;s Treasury your letter of the 22nd ultimoproposing that a Census of Production should be heldin the year 1922 in respect of production carried onin 1921,     In reply I am to request you to inform theBoard cf Trade that Ky Lords regret that, in vie1,&apos;? cfthe necessity for the restriction cf Stateexpenditure to the utmost extent possible, They arounable to sanction any expenditure cn a Census ofProduction in respect of the year 1921.     I am to add that, in consequence cf the decisionof His majesty&apos;s Government on public expenditure as announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in theHouse of Commons cn the 9th instant, it will benecessary that the partial Census already approved bythe Treasury in respect of the year 192C be abandoned and that expenditure in connection with it should forthwith cease if steps have net already been takente discontinue it.                  I am;                       Sir,                  Your obedient Servant,                  [Signed) R,S. kSIKLEJCHN,Tho Secretary,   Board of Trade,
BOARD OF TRADE,   Great George  Street,           22nd  NovBnfbor, J320,Sir,     I am directed by the Board of Trade to  advert to  your letter No.55318/19 of 30th December,  1919,  stating that the lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s  Treasury concurred inthe proposal that a census of production should  be taken in1921, in rssped of the year 1920. Preparatory  steps  havebeen taken in connection -with that census including the compilation of a register of manufacturers  and the issue of draft schedules t^ associations of manufacturers and chambers of Commerce for their observations and suggestions.     The Board have had under consideration  the  question ofthe provision ci adequate Information with regard to the productive industries of the United Kingdom  during the periodof transition to normal conditions and they  deem it essentialthat a further oensus should be taken in the year 1922, underthe Census of Production Act, in respect of  production carriedcn in 1921.   The Census already sanctioned and  to be  takennext year does not cover the whole field of productionIndustry and the Board are strongly of opinion that, in orderthat a survey of the whole field may be made as  soon as thegeneral condition of industry is sufficiently favourable andthat a beginning may be made of a fresh series of periodicalCensuses, a full enquiry be made in 1922,     It was estimated that the cost in salaries  of the partialCensus referred to in the above mentioned letter would beabout  50,000.   Since the estimate was made it  has beenfound possible to reduce it by omitting from the enquiry someof the smaller firms and by oontlnued attention  to  economicalmethods, and it is now probable that  the cost will  be  under 30,000,   As regards the complete Ces\sue proposed  to  be takenin 1922 the estimated expenditure for salaries,  so  far as can be at present foreseen, will be about  80,000.   Ofthis amount it is probable that about  15,000 will  fall to be expended in the financial year 1921-22,  40,000  in  1922-23and the remaining  25,000 in 1023-24.     In addition to the  80,000 it will be necessary toprovide a  sum for the Ministry of Agriculture and theDepartments of Agriculture  for Scotland and Ireland forthe pi^pose of  carrying out that part of the enquiry relatingto Agriculture.   It is understood that such enquiry InEngland and Wales is estimated to  cost about  25,000  and itappears probable that for Sootland and Ireland together thecost would be between  5,000 and  7,000.     I am to request that you will be good enough to  laythe Board&apos;s proposals before the Lords Commissioners  of HisMajesty&apos;s Treasury for their approval,                                   I am.
