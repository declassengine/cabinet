(P 638)          From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,            1107                               27th January 1921.                                (Received 7 p.ni.)     Priority A.     128 S.   Secret.  Persia.   Our  telegram of  the 22nd  January,  No. 107  S.Following  is Dobbs&apos; appreciation: &quot; Whether Bolsheviks bring Persia  under their influence by invasion or  by propaganda resulting in republic or by making puppet ofShah at Teheran, I  think consequent increase oi&apos; their prestige, working on preclis-position of Amir in their favour and against us,  will probably make  Afghanistandecide that she must at all costs keep on good terms Avith Bolsheviks.   While in theirhearts fearing the effect of Bolshevik propaganda on  themselves, conceit of Afghanofficials makes them flatter themselves that they can pass it  on into  India withoutcontaminating Afghanistan.  Another factor  will  be undefended  state  of  Avesternborder  of  Afghanistan, and fear that Persia, when friend of Bolsheviks, will reviveformer  claims direction  of  Herat and  Sistan.  I  fear, therefore, that Ave must  beprepared for the worst effect.     &quot;I clo not think Ave  can avoid ill-consequences by  attempting to  buy Afghanfavour,  which would only confirm their present belief in our Aveakness and make them more intractable.  They are putting forward enormous  demands, and only possible means of bringing them to their senses lies, I believe, in keeping our heads high, and ,firm front.&quot;
