R&quot; FORT BY THT GTN^RAL OFFICER COH^n)EiG-IN-CHOT                      KIT)IMG JANUARY 29th. 1921.            (Circulated to the Cabinet 07 the Secretary of State                                 for &quot;&apos;ar).1. G^MSRAT  SITUATION,   There is no substantial change to be recorded in t^e&quot;&quot;(?general   ^l&quot;^ViJEliation;   hostile activity has continued though ina less marked decree than  during the previous week, and has been almost entirely confined to the Martial Law Area.      The intensified campaign of outrage has only been jlrt progress for a short time, following a period of abnormal quietness, and theweek before lost was one of exceptional activity, it cannot, however,be expected that this-decrease of crime will continue in the immediatefuture, the diminution last week being no doubt In port due to the fuller information which is Doing obtained by the Crown Forces butprincipally to the increasing success with which the rebels were dealt with when they ventured on enterprises which resulted in an engagement with&quot;the troops or the police.      A Icrry was ambushed in Dublin on Saturday night resulting inthe wounding of one officer and eight other ranks, and two cases have occurred of &quot;&quot;Military Barracks in the partial Law Area being fired onin one of which cases at least the attackers suffered casualties.These attacks are a new form of Sinn ^ein Operations, previous raids on military Barracks having been carried out with a view to obtainingarms after admission had been gained by means of a ruse or by treacheryon the part of civilian employees *      Reference was made in my report of January 11th to the destruct-ion of bridges in Counties Meath and Kildare.  This policy is still being followed and the area of destruction has spread northwardsthrough County Meath.   The usual procedure is to destroy a road orbridge to such an extent as to make it impassable for heavy motor transport but to admit of smaller vehicles using it.  The object aUmedot is not clearr no attacks have taken place in localities which havebeen so dealt with and if it is simply intended to deny the use of theroads to Military transport, it Is not apparent why operations shouldhave been confined to one oourit.yA   It is more likely that it is being done as a means of annoying the Crown Forces and drawing their attentiofrom the Partial Law Area.,      There is still no general sign that the Irish Republican army is losing its hold over tho young men of the country or that there is any substantial section which is prepared openly to repudiate its aims and methods, nor have the loaders given any indication that they have any Intention of changing thorn.   It is perhaps to some extentsignificant that in the series of trials now proceeding on charges ofthe murder of officers in Dutlin the accused have been defended by counsel and have not as in previous cases (one of which resulted in theexecution of the prisoner), declined to recognise the Court.2.  OPERATIONS.E4th January - A party of rebels fired on the military barracks atBandon, County Cork,,  The shooting was very wild and a sorti party shotpn armed man who was firing from a tree and brought in his body*84th January.

The lorry was fired at whilepassing through one ambush and was shortly afterwords fired at and .bombed by another ambush when the Officer and eight other rank3 vjerewounded.  The fire was returned in both cases but the rebei casulties are unknown.29th January.  A party of Auxiliary Police raided Cullenswood House.,DuBTIn and Tound indications that it -as being used by some of themost important leaders of the I.R.A.  This house had been previouslyraided when a secret office containing very valuable documents was dis-covered^   It was noticed that since the previous raid various struct-ural alterations j such ns the building of false&quot; walls j had been made.A thorough search     therefore made of the premises on January 30thwhen, the dummy walls were broken down and some other damage was done to the house.   As the house has undoubtedly been used as a refuge bythe most prominent members of the T.R.A, this action was thoroughlyjustifiable.5a  SIT:Si!0T ^PRiso^Rs W &quot;.&apos;.)*. CAMPS.
