This  document is the property of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.                                  8SECRET.CP. 2559.THE  CABINET.THE  &quot; EINWOHNERWEHR&quot;  IN  GERMANY.     MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR WAR.    I circulate an extract from  a further letter from  my German correspondent inBavaria (see CP. 2460), in which  he gives  particulars for which I had asked as to theformation and character of the Einwohnerwehr.   It seems  to me very important thatthese facts should be tested and verified.  If they are  true they would certainly showthat this force is no danger whatever to France or to us, but is on the other hand avery great security  against  a  Bolshevik  revolution  in  Bavaria.   I have askedGeneral Bingham to institute special enquiries.                                                                    W. S.  C.  THE  WAR OFFICE,      10th February, 1921.                                                      Munich,                                                         2Uh January, 1921.               *               *              *               *    In order to answer your questions, let me state that  the unities of the BavarianEinwohnerwehr have a purely local character, of different strength according to the farms, villages, markets and cities, just like the fire brigades.  Regiments,  battalions,companies,  or  any  other  military formations do not exist.   Very much like theAmerican &quot; law-and-order  committees,&quot; they  are willing  to maintain law  and orderwithin their districts.    There is a very small percentage which, in case of emergency,  would leave  theirown districts for support of the regular troops (Reichswehr) if the latter show a lack ofsufficiency in revolutionary centres.  The whole Bavarian Einwohnerwehr, however, is neither ready nor intended for any use beyond the Bavarian frontier.    A  great portion of the Einwohnerwehr men, in many districts more than 50 percent., are over 50, 60, and even 70 years old, and only employable  in local police service.Many of them  had  no military  training whatsoever.   No  man who enters  theEinwohnerwehr passes a medical inspection for physical test.  It  transpires from these facts that the Einwohnerwehr in a European war would be but  &quot;  food for the cannon,&quot;and all these facts can be verified by you at any time.
