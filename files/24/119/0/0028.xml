I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of the Cabinet,  a Memorandum.which I have received from the Board of Customs and Excise regarding the retentionof the control of beer and spirit prices.                                                         (Initialled)      A. C.    Treasury, S.W.,         February 2, 1921.CONTROL OF BEER AND SPIRIT PRICES.     1. The control of beer and  spirit prices  was first imposed/in connection with therestriction  of beer output and of deliveries of  spirits for consumption measures which became necessary  tor the conservation  of  food  supplies during the  war.   The main object of controlling prices  was to prevent  discontent through excessive charges beingmade at a time when supplies were artificially restricted.  Restriction on quantities wasremoved in 1919,  but control of prices remained, and  has been  used since 1918  tofacilitate the raising of additional revenue by means of increases in the rates of duty onbeer and  spirits.   Now  that all restrictions on quantities are removed, it becomes necessary to examine whether any justification remains for keeping on control of prices,and the object of this Memorandum is to look at this question from the revenue pointof view.     2. Speaking broadly, control of prices is desirable in the interests of the revenue solong as demand is greater than supph.   Whenever  this is  the  case,  the tradersconcerned are in a position to obtain  very high  profits by selling a comparatively small[quantity at an  excessive figure, and, as in the  case of beer  and spirits  the duty isIrelated primarily  to ths quantity consumed,  the revenue  suffers accordingly.  Oncesupplies have increased  beyond  the point where competition  comes fully  into play,control can safely be removed.                                   Beer Prices.     3. We are  of opinion that  control of beer prices (which  is  limited  to  the retail[price charged to the consumer) can be abolished.  In coming to this conclusion we have considered the effect of  control in increasing the productiveness of the revenue in thelast few years by keeping down beer retail prices.   But supplies of  beer are now fullyequal to the demand, and we think that competition may be trusted to keep the retail prices of beer at about their piesent level.   Possibly some advance in price might takeplace in the case of the highest class beers,  but this would not be important.     4. The Food  Controller in his Cabinet Memorandum (C.P.-2287) states that he is advised that the Beer (Prices and Description) Order could  be safely revoked  if gravity restrictions were abolished.  We cannot see that there is any connection between the controls of prices and of average gravity.  We  can well understand that the Ministry of Food find the gravity  restrictions difficult to administer, and they may wish to see them  disappear, but they could  certainly remain  even if control  of prices werelabandoned.       [5551]V
                                   Spirit Prices.     f). The control  of spirit prices (lifters  from the control of beor  prices in thatinter-trade as well as retail prices are subject to control.  It is therefore necessary toconsider whether control of inter-trade prices or of retail prices or of both could safely be abolished.     (i. We do not think that revenue interests would he prejudiced by the removal ofcontrol from inter-trade prices.  This was imposed in order to safeguard  trade interests,and  no  revenue  consideration is involved.   We  have &quot;rounds  for believing that the controlled inter-trade prices are largely ignored, and  it would appear desirable to allow the  various trade interests to adjust  matters between themselves rather than for theState to attempt the task.     7. On the other hand, we do not think that the time has come for the removal ofthe control of retail spirit prices, as under existing conditions there is no doubt that itwould result in a substantial  raising of  the  charges  made  to the public.   This wouldmean less  consumption and, consequently, less revenue.   Amongst  the causes of this state of affairs may  be mentioned the retailers somewhat narrow margin  of profit onspirits, the  desire of exporters  to obtain large profits in the foreign market and thepolicy of wholesalers in conserving the more mature spirit, due to their desire to realisehigher profits on their old spirit than the existence  of  control  and the Excess ProfitsDuty at present allows.     8. The Food Controller in his  Memorandum (O.P.-2287) refers to the large profitsbeing made from the export trade in  spirits as a difficulty in removing the control ofprices.  This has certainly been prominent amongst the causes which operated  in thecourse of  1920 to restrict supplies of spirits in the home market.   While the maximumcontrolled  price  in the home market was 14s. 2d. per proof gallon, the exporter could obtain from 30s. to 40s. per proof gallon in  the foreign market.   The  effect  has beenthat, whereas the exports in 191(5  did not exceed one-third  of the home consumption in that year, the exports since the last Budget have been at  the rate of approximately one-halt&apos; the  home  consumption for that  period.  Recently, however, exports have declined, whilst deliveries for home consumption have increased.  It is therefore difficultto say how  far  the export trade  will  interfere  with the supply of spirits  for home consumption in 1921.     9. Our information goes to show that  there is now  no withholding of supplies ofthe  younger and cheaper spirits, but there  is a likelihood  that  the supplies of this class of spirit will  be prejudiced in  the next  year  or  two by the operation  of theImmature  Spirits Act.   Distillation of  spirits for potable  purposes  was  practicallynon-existent in   1917  and  1918, and  did not  start again in any quantity until theautumn of 1919. Thus  there  will be  little three-year-old  spirit to come on  to themarket  in the next  eighteen months, and, as has heen  stated  above,  wholesalers  are unwilling to release the maturer kinds.   For these reasons we think that it would be dangerous to remove retail control.   If the Immature Spirits Act were amended so  asto allow as a temporary measure the release of spirits after, say, eighteen months, then we are inclined to the opinion that retail as well as inter-trade control could go.
