:HI0 l-OCITk. i;i&apos;r  IS  THE; PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.      i                                      &quot;                   5HOUSINGH.26,Memorandum by the Minister of Health.          In connection with the Report of the Cabinet Com-mittee on the admission of ex-service men into theBuilding Traded I think it advisable to offer some general observations on the present position as regards labour supplyand progress on that part of the Government housing scheme whichis being carried out through local authorities and publicutility socleties,          Labour statistics for housing scheme are received foreach month soon after the opening of the succeeding month.  Thelatest figures available at present are those for the end,ofDecember and they show that at that time the number of men employed on the schemes in question was 40,505 skilled and41f294unskilled, total 81,798.  The corresponding figures at the end oflast July were 18,917 and22,414, total &amp;,331,  This means thatIn five months the labour force on these schemes was nearlydoubled, without recourse to any such special schemes of augments *tion by ex-service, men as have been under consideration.          The  number of houses under construction was on the31st July 37,022, and on the 31st December 57,014.  Apart fromthose completed at the dates named, namely  in July 4,394 and  inDecember 15,421,  The inference  from these figures is that without special measures the rate of the labour supply on housing and theprogress in construction are already improving, and from such information as we have it appears that  the  Introduction of agoodly number  of new men into  the industry  Is quietly going  on.Having regard  to conditions in  the Building  Trade generally  Itis reasonable  to assume that this process of expansion of thelabour force will continue steaJily.
          At the end of December, however, there was still ashortage on work under construction estimated at 12,625 skilled men and there Here about 102,000 houses in approved tenders and about 72,000 in signed contracts on which work had not been begun,for various reasons of which difficulty as to labour was certainly not the least important.          In a memorandum  submitted to the Cabinet Finance CommitteeI have proposed, with the  sole object of reducing  cost, that weshould for the moment specially concentrate on the 172,000 housesprovided for in approved tenders  (with a margin over and above this for urgent cases), and  only  sanctioning the constructionof the balance of  300,000  as prices fall.  In order to constructhouses at a reasonable rate  of speed we require augmentation oflabour and increase of output.  Recent experience  indicates thatwe are obtaining material  augmentation of labour in the ordinary course and I am  advised that there are evidences of a general increase of output subject to marked exceptions in certain places.          It is roughly estimated that &quot;to produce 100,000 houses in a year 63,750  skilled men and  approximately the same numberof unskilled men  are  required, at a rate  of output higher than  isnow generally  obtained on  housing schemes.  On a programmeof 57,000 uncompleted houses and  102,000  houses in approvedtenders  or contracts  there is clearly room for considerable-further  augmentation  of labour apart from any allowance for thebalance  over this  figure referred to above.  There  is  no guarantee that  we  shall obtain  such augmentation In a  reasonable period without  special measures.          Agreement by the Government with employers and  employed as to  special measures for augmentation from the ranks  of theunemployed ex-service men  would  simply mean accelerating  byconsent  a process  which  as I have  shown  is going on  In theordinary course  of business.   Such  agreement  is by far the  best  solution and I  am not  without hopes that  it  may  be  promoted by  such  practical measures as  are  outlined  in  the  Circular  for
issue to local authorities by myself,  the draft of which is appended to the Report of the Cabinet  Committee and no opportunity of furthering such an agreement should be lost.  Theactual absorption of any large number  of- ex-service men In thetrad:- would be found in the long run to be more quickly effected in that  way.          The contingency that agreement may be impossible hasof course to be faced.  If that occurs, it is only too likely toproduce a situation which may well have disastrous resultson housing progress for a time which cannot be estimated, either by causing a strike or by producing a  general concerted slowing down of output.  Such a situation will be particularly           ,deplorable at a time when the housing schemes are through thevery difficult initial stages and solid and increasing progress is bein; recorded,towards which the decline in outside industrial building is an important contributing factor and Is likely tobecome not less potent in the near future.          In deference to the decision of the Cabinet as to the absorption of ex-service men in housing I have assisted in thepreparation of the report of the Committee but as the minister responsible for Housing I should fall in my duty if I did notdraw attention to the above considerations and ask that they beborne carefully in mind in deciding what the next step as regardsabsorption of ex-service men is to be.
