February 3rd, 1921,The Right Honourable T.

These  do not include walling masonsjfurther,  the  bricklayers have  accepted during the last few  months                                                       roughly/
roughly 2,000 juveniles and apprentices and the industry generally has adsorbed hundreds of disabled ex-Service men.3,   The vote which has been cast upon the proposals of theGovernment is composed of at least 50$ of ox-Service men.4*   Reliable and trustworthy evidence has been obtained by various sections of the Industry that labour in all itsbranches is capable of meeting the demands of the market atthe present time; in fact, at the present time, there are,In round figures 50,000 Building Trades Operatives unemployed.,.5.   The Building work and repair on factories and industrial establishments, which had fallen in arrear during the War, as now been practically completed and leaves quite a large volumeof labour available for houses,6.  Regarding the housing programme we have no knowledge ofany repudiation of the statement, which had wide presspublicity, that the estimate of the Registrar General for housing demands would be met by the construction of 140,000houses;  We think this figure is ridiculously low and feel justified in urging upon the Government the importance ofdischarging their-full housing programme further the statement that the Finance Committee of the Cabinet have oounoiledreduction of the Government housing commitments has causedalarm amongst our membership as to future prospects ofemployment, We hope that the Government will push forward and fulfil its promised housing programme not only to absorbethe unemployed there will be but in the interest of theNations Health,  May we suggest that the present unemployedbe sustained in accordance with the programme of the LabourParty from that section who amassed huge fortunes out of  theNations need  during the period of the  late European VTar,  In                                            conclusion/
conclusion we wish to state that the  figures which are proposed for absorption would be impossible of  application^We have already proved the present alarming position ofunemployment in the Industry*     We yield to none in our desire to see every ablebodied person provided employment or sustenance but  no solution of the present problem can he found by putting  oneof the present unemployed in a Job and discharging a personalready there.     On behalf of the national Federation of Building TradesOperatives.                                Yours truly,                                 (Sgd.)
