                                GENERAL.       The increase  in  unemployment  and  underemployment  continues.    Thejoiners&apos; strike in  the shipbuilding industry  continues,  and this is preventing anyrevival in this industry which might otherwise have been anticipated owing to thereduction in the price of steel.  Ship repair work is still suffering from continentalcompetition.   The position in the cotton and  woollen textile industries remains unchanged, but an improvement is taking place in the lace industry, and a more hopeful feeling is manifest in the boot and shoe trade,  particularly  among  manu-facturers who are supplying cheap goods.  Short time is increasing in the iron andsteel industry  at Sheffield, but at Ebbw Yale a  considerable number  of workpeopleare expecting to restart shortly at the local  steel works.   Work in the transporttrades continues very slack.                         II. EMERGENCY WORK.    The Prime Minister made  a statement  in the  House  of  Commons  on the19th October  on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment.He outlined  schemes for  employing  a large number  of fit  ex-Service men  inconnection with the  Housing Programme, on  which negotiations with  the tradeunions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme forArterial Roads in London and in the provinces; whilst at the same time pressing forward  with the Ministry of  Transports programme of road classification andmaintenance  grants.    A further statement was made by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December,indicating that the further proposals of the Government included: a final endeavourto secure an agreement with the building trades for the admission of ex-Service men;a rapid extension of road construction schemes; the distribution by the Unemploy-ment  Grants  Committee, under the Chairmanship of Viscount St. Davids, of a sumof  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting local authorities on relief schemes otherthan  house building  and road work; and the  amendment of the UnemploymentInsurance Act (1920) in  order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who hadbeen unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualifytor benefit. It has since been agreed that the Unemployment Grants Committee shall also deal with schemes in respect of road work other than those undertaken by theMinistry of Transport,                      ROAD WORK PROGRAMME.
