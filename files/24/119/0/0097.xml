576This aDocumejitJsJL^His C^annb Majepty^s Government.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 194615th February 1921.(Received 11.30 a.rn.)Clear the line.204 &quot;S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following from Dobbs, 39 C. of 12thFebruary i &quot; Afghans have made no sign since my interview of the 10th. Motor arrives on15th instant, If Afghans reject my proposals I suggest that I leave for Indiaimmediately without attempting to deal with any matter at issue between twoGovernments except Arnawai. Regarding latter, I suggest that I should presentformal note before leaving, requesting evacuation within one month. It would beintolerable that Afghans should continue forcible occupation of Arnawai after rupture \of negotiations, and their action in question will be good test of their behaviourduring coming period of aloofness. If they refused to evacuate, we should presumablyproceed to stop trade at Khyber and at Chaman and Kundi. Please telegraph whethermy suggestions are approved.&quot;Following is our reply, dated 14th February : &quot;Your telegram of 12th February, 39 C, Government of India agree generally.But before finally breaking up the negotiations you will doubtless insist on a formalmeeting, preferably in the presence of Amir himself, at which you will sum up the&quot;position and make it clear that the Government of India, acting under the authorityof His Majesty&apos;s Government, have been most reluctantly forced into breaking offnegotiations for the reason already stated. A note requesting evacuation of Arnawaiwithin a month should be then presented, and Afghan Government should be plainlywarned that failure to evacuate Arnawai within this period may compel us to takedrastic measures to stop all trade with Afghanistan. Should they request furthertime for reconsideration, you should give them a definite time limit, which is left toyour discretion.  Forty-eight hours is suggested.&quot;
