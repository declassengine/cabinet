Lord D&apos;Abernon to Earl Curzon. (Received January 26.)(No. 17.)My Lord,                                            Paris, January 20, 1921.     I HAVE the honour  to report that  as a result of very numerous conferencesbetween the members of the Brussels Conference we have now arrived at agreementrespecting the main heads  of our report to the Supreme Council.     I enclose an advance copy of the report.     An endeavour has been made by the members of the Brussels Conference tokeep the report as impartial as possible, to take into full account the representations of the German delegation at Brussels,  and to make suggestions for the improvementof German finance on technical and scientific lines.     We have carefully avoided the tone of the blind and reckless creditor who caresonly for the rapid encashment of his debt, without reference to the position or thosolvency of the debtor.     Trie whole position respecting the payment of reparation by  Germany must beconsidered, not only  in the light of the report of the Brussels Conference, but alsoin connection with the subjects of my two despatches to your Lordship of yesterday(Nos. 15 and  16) the one stating Herr Bergmann&apos;s  views, and, presumably, theviews of the German Government, regarding the possibilities of payment;  the othercovering a memorandum on the legal position.     My hope  is that these three  documents will put your Lordship  in possession ofthe main elements which bear upon the question as it will be discussed at the paris conference next week.     I have, of course, a mass of further  detail upon  the subject  of reparation, but so far as  I am able to judge, there is nothing essential which the above-mentionedcommunications do not contain.                                                        I have,  &amp;c.                                                             D&apos;ABERNON.     Enclosure in No. 1.Exports Conference, Brussels.                    Report to the Allied Governments.                                 (a.)  General.    1.  IT is impossible at present to form a definite opinion on the general situation of Central Europe, on  the  dangers  of bankruptcy caused by  the  unprecedentedfiduciary inflation, and on the intrinsic value of  the real wealth, which  to-day is expressed only by a mass of paper money.    German exports benefit by the fact that wages and the cost of raw materials inGermany have not increased in proportion to the depreciation of the mark in foreign exchange.  But it is difficult to indicate how long  this situation is likely to last.    Generally, we recognise  that the economic situation of Germany is much betterthan heT present financial situation.    Clearing  up  the  financial situation wouldenable the economic possibilities of Germany to develop;  there is thus a possibilityof considerable prosperity, as soon as the financial and currency difficulties have been overcome; but it is almost impossible to say how soon this  result can be attained.    At the same time, it is  a major interest to let Germany  know, with the  least possible delay, the extent of her  obligations, so as to put her in the way both ofproviding the means to meet them and of  beginning as soon as possible actually topay them off.5277 cc-1] oB
i     Under  these conditions, the Brussels experts have thought it the right course to explore the  possibilities of an agreement by which Germany  would give a firmundertaking to pay, for five years, an annuity on the scale of 3 milliard gold marksa year, thus postponing fixation of the capital debt and the  amount of the laterannuities to some date as near  as may be,  in order to permit the restoration  of ameasure of order in Germany&apos;s  financial situation.     It has  been  proposed  that  the  annuity should consist  partly of  deliveries in kind, in accordance with the different annexes to the treaty, and  partly  of  cashpayments, and various suggestions, intended to regulate deliveries in kind, and make them more productive, have been considered in the scheme.     These suggestions have been communicated to Herr Bergmann, and  have  beenthe subject of discussion between him  and the German Government.     2.  It would  be an error to try to balance the German budget by borrowing.Equilibrium must be established by increasing  revenue and  reducing expenses.   Bythese means Germany would be able      (a.) To stop  the printing press.     (b.) To avoid recourse to borrowing, except for the special objects of obtaining          necessary raw materials on short credit for the periods necessary to allow          them  to be worked up by German factories,  or  of funding the  floating          debt,  or, again, of  discharging, in advance, part of the  reparation          obligations.     The chaos  of Germany&apos;s present  financial situation is  due principally to herincessant recourse in  the past  to  unfunded borrowings and to the printing of currency, whereas her proper course would have been to demand greater fiscal effortsfrom the country.     On the present ordinary budget, direct taxation appears to be high enough, andmay be found too high when the  scheme of direct taxation comes into full operation;but indirect  taxation is inadequate, particularly  as regards  alcoholic drink, and,perhaps, customs.  It may also  be noted that the  taxation  system contemplated inthe new budget has not yet yielded the full return of which it  is capable.   Thepossible effect on Germany&apos;s ultimate  economic recovery of the severe taxation ofcapital most of which has not yet been collected must not be lost sight of.     There is room for reduction of certain expenses on the ordinary budget, but no substantial decrease of the total ordinary expenses can be looked for; thus, thoughreductions of personnel may be contemplated, it is  to be feared that economy in thisdirection will be  largely offset by increases of pensions and inevitable additions tosalaries and wages to adjust them to the cost of living.     The German estimates of extraordinary expenditure have been drawn up  veryextravagantly and without reference to the facts; they are certainly too high.    For all details concerning the budget, see Annex I.   ,  The general  conclusion of  this annex is that a large number of  the items ofextraordinary expenditure can be abolished, reduced or deferred until the ordinarybudget shows a surplus.                               (b.) Suggestions.             (Submitted for the approval of the Allied Governments.)     1. Taking into consideration the danger of fixing the total German indebtednessat a figure which may prove too low, the Brussels experts,  in spite of the  presentdepression of Germany&apos;s financial  condition, cannot  take the responsibility ofsuggesting a total lower than that indicated in the Boulogne Agreement.   t  Considering  further that a scheme of annuity payments will be  adopted by theAllied Governments following the general lines of the above agreement, the following suggestions  are made for simplifying  and making more efficacious  the  reparationprocedure:      (1.) As  provided in the Boulogne Agreement,  Germany  to pay during the next          five  years  annuities on the scale of magnitude of 3 milliard gold marks.          Details of the exact application of this  principle  during this transitional          period of five years  (e.g., whether  payments should be spread  equally          or unequally over the period) will be studied and settled at Brussels.
    (2.) Payment of these annuities may be looked for partly by deliveries in kind           and partly by cash  payments, part of  which would be provided by the           retention (by  the Allies) of a percentage of the proceeds of the sales in           foreign  countries  made by certain  large German trading corporations           (see Annex II).    The principle of a minimum payment in cash will be laid down.    Discontinuation of the advances made by the Allies against the coal deliveries.    Establishment  by the Reparation Commission of definite rules  for fixing theprice of deliveries in kind laid down in the treaty, the price of other deliveries being settled in the special agreements which will be made for the purpose.    Annex III gives  some indication of the scale  on which Germany has  so fardischarged her financial obligations.    2. Securities and Guarantees.    (1.) First guarantee of the annuity is the right  conferred by Article 248 of theTreaty of Versailles.    No administrative interference in  Germany&apos;s  public finance  is  contemplate under the right thus conferred, so long as the annuity is duly paid.    (2.) Germany to undertake to establish special taxes, if her existing revenuesare insufficient.    Particularly indirect taxes (on alcohol, coal, &amp;c.) and customstaxes can be contemplated (see Annex IV).    (3.) Germany to recognise the right of the Allies  to occupy and administer hercustoms in case of failure to carry out her obligations,  and in that case only.    Equally,  the Allies  to be empowered to require Germany to suppress certainexpenses, in particular (as is contemplated by paragraph 12, Annex 2, Part VIII,of the Treaty of Versailles) the suspension of the service and sinking fund of herinternal debt.    (4.)  Upper Silesia.    Inter-Allied control of  the distribution  of  coal to be established  after the plebiscite, in order to assure equitable division of the supplies.    The Reparation Commission  has made elaborate  studies on this question, andpossesses  all  necessary  information.    The  conclusion  to  be drawn is  that theimportance of  Upper  Silesia  to  the  economic life of  Germany  must not  be exaggerated, on condition that measures  are taken similar to that suggested above.    (5.)  Possible alleviations in the manner of applying the treaty.     (6.)  It must be clearly established in  the first place that no concession can becontemplated  on the following  points:     (a.)  Limitation of immediate reparation  payments  to deliveries in kind, and           postponement of all cash payments to iater annuities.     (b.)  Reduction of coal deliveries below the level fixed in the Spa Agreement.     (c.)  Continuation of the  coal advances by the Allies.     (i.) Sequestered  and  liquidated property of  German nationals  in  Allied           countries.     Impossibility (subject to reservation indicated below)  of accepting  Herr vonStauss&apos; Brussels proposal for restoration to former owners of sequestered propertynot yet liquidated; and  also  of Herr Melchior&apos;s proposal that the  German Govern-men should be allowed to deposit in neutral banks, as collateral for a loan, bearersecurities in Allied companies held by German nationals.     (e.)  Cancellation of the plebiscite in Upper Silesia.     On the other hand, it would seem  that certain alleviations could be given toGermany in a spirit of equity as well as to facilitate a general agreement.     The Allied Governments are requested to give a general indication of principle on the suggestions made below all details  being  settled  by  the  conference  at brussels:      (a.)%Armies of Occupation. Limitation to 240,000,000 gold marks  a year of            the amounts  to be reimbursed to the Allied  Governments on account of            the armies of occupation expenses, as contemplated in the note of the            Prime Ministers to Germany of the 16th June, 1919.
          The Allied  Governments  can  decide whether,  after  the above      reduction, the charge  for the armies of occupation should be included or      not in the temporary annuities.          Expert inter-Allied delegates to meet at once&quot; to settle questions      relative to armies of occupation charges, and get in touch with the various      Allied War Offices, to obtain from them all necessary information.  They      should  report to the Allied Governments before the 1st  April,  1921,      setting  out clearly  the actual  expenditure of the different armies  of      occupation, and making practical suggestions upon :           (1.) Possible economies, whether by the  Allied  armies or by  the               German Government, to enable  the desired result to be attained.          (2.) On an equitable system of the division of expenses amongst the               Allies (Annex  V).(b.) Simplification of the  various  Heads of Reparation,  and, other Financial      Obligations imposed upon Germany by  the Treaty. This simplification      is desirable in the interests of the Allies as well  as Germany.   A clear      statement of the situation should be drawn up, showing all  the payments      which Germany is obliged to make in virtue of the treaty, which compete      with reparation payments.   Reductions, or special facilities as  regards      means of payment, should be considered in the interests of reparation.          As regards  Germany, she ought to  be  placed in a position to know      definitely what obligations  to  expect, and  to  release herself from  the      present situation^ which involves unexpected demands for payment, and      thus creates situations very prejudicial to German exchange.(c.) Economic  Relations. Assurance to Germany that the Allies do not intend      to use the  stipulations of the Treaty of Versailles to  prevent legitimate      development of German trade (see Annex VI).(d.) Ships.-(See  Annex VII).          (1.) Waiver by the Allies,  under  certain conditions, of the claim to               new tonnage which Germany  is  under  contract  to build and               deliver to the Allies.          (2.) Possibility of  allowing Germany to  retain  for     )^ears  part               of the existing tonnage which she has not yet delivered, or          (3.) Restoring to Germany, for    years,      tons of  what she has               already  delivered tramp tonnage only, and not  passenger               liners.                   Germany  must withdraw forthwith her refusal  to  grant               emigration licences for Allied lines,  and guarantee fair  treat-               ment to Allied shipping companies.(e.) The Debt  Clearing Offices. Debit balances due by  the German office to be      discharged by a  fixed monthly payment, the  amount of which will be      settled  in advance.(f.) Reprisals  under Paragraph 18 of Annex 2 of Part VIII of the Treaty. It      is  probable  that the Allies  intend  to follow  Great Britain in  her      renunciation of  the right to take reprisals against certain categories of      German private property.   This renunciation might also be extended to      other forms of private property.(g.) Sequestered German Property in Allied Countries. Possibility of making      certain exemptions in  favour of small owners or  small properties  (see      Annex  VIII).January 18, 1921.
ANNEX I.                      German Budget and Public Finance.                                       I.     The German budget, 1920 (see Appendix 1)  is in round figures-                                                             Milliard marks.         Receipts          ...      ...       ...       ...      .,,      40         Expenses     .    ...      ...       ...       H(^-         Plus supplementary estimates      ...         4^                                                   -           115     The deficit works  out at 76 milliards after deducting estimates now before theReichstag, which amount, for food subsidies only, to 7 milliards (answer to question24 of the Brussels Questionnaire).     To appreciate  the situation which  these figures represent, it is necessary to distinguish receipts and expenses of a permanent character from  those which willappear at a constantly dimishing figure in future  budgets.  This sifting process hasbeen attempted in Appendix 2, which is admittedly open to criticism, and does notpurport to convey more than a general order of magnitude.  Its conclusion is that over 51  milliards ought to disappear from budgets of the more or  less near  future,and  that 8 milliards of the  receipts are  of a temporary character.                                                                 Milliards.        The permanent expenses  appearing in the  1920 budget             appear to amount (ordinary and extraordinary budget             combined) to    ...       ...      ...       ../     ...    85                (of which   about  40  milliards  are  for  execution                     of the  Peace  Treaty.)        And the permanent receipts to       ...       ...      ...    32        The  permanent budget thus presents a deficit of      ...    53                                      II.     Assuming that the  total deficit, as shown above, is accurate,  is it possible to anticipate an improvement of the resulting situation in the course of the next fewfinancial years1?     Such an improvement might be made either by recourse to borrowing,  or by areduction of expenses, or by  an increase of revenue.1. Borrowina.     It is precisely its past recourse to floating debt that has brought the Reich faceto face with its present deficit.  The borrowing policy involves all the evils brought out in the German reply to questions 1 and 2 of the Brussels Questionnaire.   It mustend in a further increase in the fiduciary circulation, which is inherently injuriousnot only to the credit of the State, but also to financial, economic and social prosperity of the whole country of Germany.    A loan  designed to cover the budget deficit would apparently have small chanceof success, given the present low credit of the Empire.  Further, such a loan, even ifit were  possible,  would  involve  the  grave  evil  of putting  off  the  ultimatelyindispensable effort of reducing expenditure  and increasing revenue.    Borrowing must be  limited, as laid  down by  the  international  financial con-ference  of Brussels, to the funding of  the internal  floating debt: the discharge inadvance of part of the reparations debt:  and finally, to the purchase of  raw materials which are to be worked up in German  factories,  and will  assist in the  recovery ofthe economic life.    The German  Government  appears  absolutely determined-as  Dr.  Wirth, theFinance Minister, has stated in several answers-&quot;to cover the expenses of the Reichentirely and permanently by its own  income;&quot;  this  is repeated  by the german delegation in its reply to question 24 of the Brussels Questionnaire.
2. Reduction of Expenses.     (a.)  A very large number of the figures found in the 1920 budget can be acceptedonly under reserve.   Certain estimates have had to be made on more or less doubtfuldata.  This is particularly the case with most of the votes for the execution of thetreaty, for the  calculation of which the German  administration was  often entirelywithout data.  The figure of 15-5 milliards for &quot;cost of armies of occupation&quot; doesnot include the sums which  Germany will have to pay the Allies in reimbursement of expenses paid by them an item on which the German Government has received no information. On the other hand,  it does not correspond at all to the actual expenseswhich can be incurred  in the financial year 1920-21 in connection with billeting,requisitions, and every  form of services in kind:  it is  a physical  impossibility forthe competent German authorities to issue &quot; orders to supply &quot; to a total even nearlyapproaching the sums voted by the Reichstag.  There will be occasion for substantial reductions of these votes for  the year 1921.-22, since, at  the 12th December, 1920, the out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred amounted to only 4,591 million paper marks,while  the  amounts voted in 1919 and 1920 together  were  16,4.55  millions.  Theexpenses incurred were  thus no more than 28 per cent, of the amounts voted.     In the same way, the 25 milliards  voted to the financial administration  for theexecution of the treaty  seems to have been fixed on highly uncertain data, since onthe 1st December, 1920, the  amount of the vote still unspent  (including the  sum of14-921. milliards carried forward  from  the end of the financial year 1919-20  out ofthe vote of  17 milliards granted  in that year) amounted to 24-834  milliards. the magnitude of the amount still in hand seems to indicate that the figure of 25 milliardsappearing in this year&apos;s budget  bore  no  relation to  Germany^ capacity to makeforeign payments. In spite of the constant vigilance and unremitting labours of theReparation Commission, the sums actually spent by Germany under sub-head 6 ofthe budget for execution of the treaty had not, by the 1st December, 1920, exceeded17  milliards, out of a vote of  42 milliards.    The  amount spent  reached some40 per cent, of the amount voted.     Equally, relative rather  than  absolute importance must he attached to the figureof 400 millions appearing in  the German budget as  &quot;provision against damagesarising from possible political disturbances in  Germany.&quot;     Finally, many of the figures appearing in  the budget  bear  the mark  of  an executive and a Parliament equally anxious to impress the world with the precariousand difficult situation  of German finance.  The political effect of the  Germanbudget upon the public  opinion of the world has not been overlooked by  the authorsof that budget:  they have, indeed, been at some pains to  create such  an effect.Dr. Wirth,  Minister of  Finance,  in introducing  his budget to the Reichstag  on the27th October, 1920, made the following observation : &quot; The budget for execution ofthe  Peace Treaty is the best  weapon for propaganda  that the  German  peoplecommands, and it must  be disseminated in millions of copies over the whole world,&quot;(shorthand report, p. 793).   The  desire so.frankly expressed to use their budget asan  instrument  of propaganda has  possibly prevented the  Government and theReichstag from exercising proper control over  the exaggerated demands  presented by the spending departments.     (b.) (1.) There are very numerous cases where a comparison of the 1920 budgetwith that of 1919 discloses  almost gratuitous increases.  Thus,  the Foreign Officevotes for  1920  rise to 295 millions as  against 24 millions in  1919 an increase of1,200 per cent, for which  no serious defence is offered. For the Home Office, the increase is 7,500 per cent. (1,433 millions against  19 millions),  the excess arising from thecreation of the &quot; security police &quot;  (1,200 millions).  For  the Post Office, staff expenseshave gone up by  630 per cent,  between 1919 and 1920 (from  736 millions to 5,366millions).  The economies that might be made on permanent administrative expensesmust unfortunately be absorbed, it seems, to a great extent by new expenses arisingfrom an  increase of  salaries and  pensions: the Government has  already had to askits  Parliament, on this  account, for a supplementary estimate of i\ milliards.     (2.)  There  is no occasion  for similar apprehensions with regard to reductions which  can be effected in the  charge on the German budget for economic subsidies ofall  descriptions.   These subsidies, including  the deficit  on  the  Reich&apos;s ownindustrial undertakings, exceed 32 milliard marks, according to the German delega-tion&apos;s answer to question 24 of  the Brussels Questionnaire; of this sum 10 milliardshave been appropriated  in reduction of the price of food, 16-3 milliards to cover the deficit on the working of the railways,  and 2-3 milliards for the  postal deficit.     These are expenses  that&apos; GermanVs financial  position can no longer admit, andthey ought, within a very short time,&quot; to disappear progressively from her budgets.


 France is 50 gold marks, or say 900 paper marks.  The German consumer thus reaps a considerable advantage,  which, it would seem, might be so charged for the benefit of the Exchequer as to produce a larger revenue than that resulting from the present coal tax of 20 per cent, of the price.  An increase of 10 per cent., assuming that the output and prices of 1920 undergo no change, would increase the  revenue by 2 or 3 milliard marks.  Customs taxes  are also capable of increase; their yield before the war was from 680 to 700 million  marks (gold), while in 1920-21 it  will only be about 250 million gold marks.  An increase is desirable from the economic as well as the fiscal  point of view.  The  fact  that wages and  the cost of raw  materials inside Germany have not risen proportionately with the depreciation of the mark in foreign exchange gives German exports substantial advantages, which sometimes appear in foreign  countries in a form which  is  &quot;dumping&quot; in the true  sense of the word, against which those countries may he forced to take protective measures.  By main- taining  the export  taxes  now in existence, perhaps even by  increasing them, the German Government, in so far as it curtails the margin in favour of the German exporter, will reassure foreign countries and avoid the counter-measures which they might take against German export trade.     The revenue from export taxes for the financial year  1920-21 was at the 1st November  1,100 millions, or 100 per cent, over the budget estimates. Conclusions.   -  1. Given (a) the future increases of revenue which may be expected  from the present  taxation system, (b) reduction of  certain expenses, it  is  possible to look forward in the near future  to a  balanced ordinary budget, from which all expenses of a non-recurrent character have been excluded.  One may even  hope, if  not next year at least in the following years, for a budget surplus.     2.  Non-recurrent and extraordinary expenses consist principally  of  economic subsidies (food subsidies, deficits on the State industrial  undertakings, subventions for various industries or various works, relief of unemployment,  &amp;C).  These should disappear   with  the  briefest delay  compatible  with  the avoidance of  social disturbances.   ,     3. As to  the budget  for execution of the treaty :      (a.)  The  present expenses should  be  heavily cut down, so as  to  reduce  to  a           minimum all outgoings which  compete with  reparation and delay the           restoration of Allied countries crippled by the  war.   This reduction does           not depend solely on the German Government who must, however, deal           with economy in compensating German nationals damaged by the treaty            but also on the Allied  Governments, so far  as  regards the total to be           claimed   from Germany  in  reimbursement for  armies of occupation           expenses, inter-Allied Commissions, &amp;c.    (b.)  The expenses of the treaty budget will have to be  defrayed; (i) by the aid of           the surplus on the ordinary budget;  (ii) by  recourse  to new sources of           revenue, consisting principally of increases in the existing indirect taxes           (especially those on  alcohol), and in customs.    It would  appear that  the Reich will be able relatively soon to meet the treaty obligations out of revenue, and without continuing the indefinite accumulation offloating debt and paper money.  It must be constantly remembered that in the last few months there has been  a considerable  improvement in Germany&apos;s  economic position, which has coincided with the successful effort of the  Government to enforce the collection  of taxes.  This improvement gives Germany grounds  to hope,  if shewill firmly determine upon it, for rapid establishment of equilibrium in her  publicfinance.  The  Allied Governments, as creditors of Germany,  are directly interestedin the  restoration of budget  equilibrium.   They are fully prepared to support theGerman Government in its financial effort, and they are most desirous to avoid anynecessity of recourse to the right conferred on them by the  treaty (paragraph 12,Annex 2, Part VIII), &quot; to create a charge in favour of the sums for reparation which germany is required  to pay upon all her revenues prior to that for the service or charge of any domestic loan.&quot;

Payments to date have been only  onaccount. .....2. As to interest tax, the figure of  138,000,000  is the only one mentioned in  the accounts published  bythe Administration.    The figure of 351,000,000 represents the total revenue collected by the Public Debt Offices of the Reich,.the States and the Communities.    This t ix will ultimately yield what was estimated.    8. The assessment fur these taxes is not yet definitely settled.    4. The smaller yield of death duties must be attributed to the fact that the settlement of estates liableto succession duty has fallen into arrears;  those now in hand are thus subject only to the old  low rates  of duty,  and the settlement of new cases subject to the new  rates has been much delayed.    5. Turnover tax will not yield the greater part of its  revenue till after January, because it is assessed  onthe total turnover of the year, and in consequence the declarations can only be made in the month of January..    * See the German delegations reply to the question formulated by the Allied experts at the BrusselsConference.

     The deliveries can be divided into the following categories:                                       I.     Commodities specified in Annexes III, V, and VI of the treaty, including alsothe commodities of  a general description stipulated in Annex IV.  The manner inwhich these Annex IV deliveries are to be made will be regulated by the ReparationCommission,  particularly with regard to  the determination of prices; in order toavoid, so far  as possible, recourse to administrative as opposed to commercial trans-actions, the number of categories of these commodities should be kept down and willbe presently specified.  Tor all other categories, the operation of Annex IV will be suspended, except that  commodities  already demanded.and in process of delivery,and  as to which an effective agreement between the Governments has already beenreached, will  continue to follow the procedure thus established. The same procedurewill  apply also in the cases mentioned below.                                      II.     Goods of whatever description purchased by those in the devastated areas.  Wecome here to Annex IV commodities not included in the list  (above mentioned) under paragraph II, (a) and  (b) of Annex IV.   These goods, of  whatever nature anddescription, will be the  subject matter of  direct acknowledgments  between the purchaser in  the devastated area and the German who supplies him.     These acknowledgments  will be converted into contracts made in accordancewith the rules of private law  and subject to the jurisdiction of the common law ofnations in all that concerns disputes of a commercial character.  At the same time,they will  include a clause to  the effect that they are subject to a special mode of payment, and that suits arising from this special mode of payment will be referred toarbitrators specially  appointed  by  the Governments concerned, the ReparationCommission,  or  a delegate nominated  by  it intervening in the last resort as finalarbitrator, and the  commission being charged generally with the  settlement of any difference of  principle that may arise.     If the judicial authorities above indicated decide  that the execution  of the disputed  contract is  impossible, the Reparation Commission will  have the righteither to require completion of the proposed delivery in virtue of its administrativeauthority under Annex IV or to annul the contract.     The German supplier will be paid out of a mark  credit created by the GermanGovernment in favour of the Reparation Commission or  any Allied bank they maynominate, and opened in the books of some financial  concern (possibly the Reichs-bank) to be appointed.  The division of this credit among the Allies concerned willbe the care of the Reparation  Commission.     A. very simple organisation  will enable the German financial  house to viser the bills drawn by the  German supplier.  Bills thus visered will be presented to anyAllied bank,  which  will transmit them to a mixed office (to be established) or  to theAllied bank which  that office  may have appointed, remitting to this office or bankthe equivalent value in &quot; certificates of damage &quot; the value of which will be discountedaccording to rules fixed  in advance; the mixed office (or its  bank) will then draw onthe German financial house a bill to the value of the goods ordered, and this hill willbe forwarded to the German supplier.  The mixed office will send the ReparationCommission and the German financial house a periodical account of the bills drawn on the mark  credit.  The Reparation Commission will credit Germany&apos;s generalreparation account  in terms of gold marks, on the basis  of the previous month&apos;saverage for dollar-exchange, New York.     Thus only one office would be required.  It would itself be responsible for viseringbills resulting from contracts for deliveries between Germans and Allied nationals;and it would  also, in effect, require the same bills to be impressed with the visa of theGerman financial house.  This process of visa would constitute, first, an &quot; authorityto pay &quot; on the reparations credit, and secondly, an approval of the contract by theGerman  Government and the interested Allied  Governments.  It will thus  implyauthority both for the export and the import of the goods ordered, and also for anycustoms drawbacks involved.                                     III.     With a view to extending  this system, it might be applied to all goods bought bythe Allies in Germany, even though the purchaser may not be in the devastated areas.Clearly it could only apply to substantial purchases, where the total sum involved

(A.)     The following table gives a rough approximate estimate, in  terms of gold marks,of  the  payments, deliveries,  cessions  and  transfers  made by Germany up  to the30th November, 1920 (column I), and of those which are likely to have been made bythe  1st May, 1921 (column 2):-	Millions of Gold Marks.

The amount of 3,250 million gold marks given for &quot;property in ceded territory&quot; includes thevalue of the rfaar coal-mines and German State property in Poland, but not that of German property inAlsace-Lorraine, which under the treaty has to be restored to France without credit to Germany in thereparation  account.    On the  other hand, the amount  does not include  any State property situated in Upper Silesia.  IfUpper Silesia associates herself to Poland, this amount will have to be increased  by about  2,750 million gold marks.    NOTE  2. This total does not include the value of &quot;abandoned material&quot; picked up  by  the Allies intheir advance beyond the armistice line.  It is practically impossible to estimate either the quantity of this material or its value.  There is thus a wide  discrepancy between Germany&apos;s estimate (3,oU0 million goldmarks) and the present figures obtained by the Reparation Commission (61 million gold marks).   Further,with regard to  the greater part of this material, the crediting of its value to Germany raises numerous legalquestions, and it is at present practically impossible to signify any figure at all under this head in a summaryof what Germany has paid.    NOTE  3.-The figure&quot; given for payments by Germany to the 30th November, 1920, in respect  or armies of occupation represents  only the value of the paper marks supplied by Germany at the requisitionof the Allied  armies (including the American) and not the value of  the services in kind which  Germany hasrendered (billeting, food,  heating and  lighting, &amp;c.);  these  may  be estimated  at about  600  million gold marks.    Neither of  these figures represents the total cost of the armies of occupation: this total, as indicatedin Annex V to  our report, is likely to amount by the 1st May, 1921, to at least 4 million  gold  marks,including the American army.    NOTE  4. The figure of 456 million gold marks represents the value of paper marks supplied to the30th September only.                                             (B.)     During  the  month  of  October  .1920  the  deliveries in  kind  (excluding  capitaldeliveries made once and for all) which Germany made amounted to a  value  of about80 million gold marks.

The Brussels Conference had already drawn Germany&apos;attention to these possibilities, and the German Government, in its reply, has expressedits hope of  increasing its  tax revenue by more than  2 milliards of paper marks byincrease of the taxation of spirits alone.     The amounts realisable from  such increase might be used as a direct guarantee for payment  of  the reparation  annuities.  But it seems preferable to charge theseannuities  on  the revenue  from  taxes  collected on the  German frontier.   In case ofdefault by Germany in the  payments due  by her, the  revenue from taxes collected onthe  frontier  would he appropriated for the reparation account,  and  the GermanTreasury, by  way of compensation, would collect the alcohol  taxes for its own account[5277 cc-1]E

    As no accounts have been kept by the occupying armies of the     Paper Marks.value of &quot; services and supplies &quot; provided without payment by theGerman Government, only two methods are available for checkingthe German estimates:   (1) examination of  the German figuresthemselves  and  the  further date furnished in support of them;and (2) estimates by  the Allied War Offices of the normal cost per unit of services of the character of those actually furnished.    In applying the latter criterion, account should, however, betaken of the probability that the demands made both in regard toquality and quantity of supplies have not improbably been on  anextravagant scale.    The further information supplied by the German Governmentindicates pretty clearly that  the greater part of the amountincluded in the&apos;budget is a purely conjectural estimate of claims which  have not yet been paid or examined-and possibly not evenreceived.    The actual payments to the 30th  November, 1920 (exclusive ofpayments under more  or  less  insignificant  heads  from  the1st October to the 30th November)  were  only ...      ...       ...     2,270,834,23.1                                                                10,871,317,966   . Thus,  out  of   the  budget  figure   of  13,142,152,197,  nearly 11,000,000,000represents a conjectural estimate of unpaid arrears and expenses for tne remainingfour months of the period.  The latter  item  probably  cannot exceed 1,000,000,000,leaving 10,000,000,000 for the unpaid arrears.    It  is quite  certain that.in the  present  condition of the German accountingarrangements  only an insignificant fraction  of  this sum can  conceivably come in course of payment before the  31st March, 1921, and the figure must be  taken asnothing better than a rough guess as to the amount of an unknown liability.    Turning to  the other suggested criterion Allied military estimates of normalcost  per unit  of services and supplies  of the character  in question the british war Office roughly estimates this  at about Is. 9c/.  per  man per day.   This would amount for a force of  120,000 to about 51,000,000 gold marks  per  annum,  say17 per cent, of the other charges as estimated under section II of  this note.    Applying this percentage to the  figures for the period to the 31st March, 1921,we arrive at a total of about 611,000,000 gold  marks about 9,800,000,000 papermarks at the present rate of exchange, but much less at the  rates current  when theexpenditure was incurred as against the German figure of 13,000,000,000.    The estimate of the  French military  authorities based on expenditure for similarservices in  France is very much lower,  being  only  about 4J per cent,  of the other charges compared with the British estimate of 17 per cent.  This would give a  totalof about 162,000,000 gold marks about 2,600,000,000  paper marks at the present rate  of exchange.    The discrepancy between the  British and French estimates isprobably acounted for in part by the higher cost of services and supplies in GreatBritain than in  France, and in part  by  the fact already referred to that by reasonof geographical causes the British army requisitions locally many things which theFrench army  imports from France.     The difference  is, however, obviously  verymuch larger than  can be accounted  for by these causes.    Neither figure  can beregarded as any real indication of the  actual cost in  Germany, regard being  hadto the  fact  that, as already stated, the demands are probably on a very much moreextravagant scale than  would be tolerated if the  armies were  quartered in theirown  countries.  For this reason, it will probably be safer  for the purpose of estimating  the past expenditure to take the British rate and apply it  to the wholeoccupying force.   Accordingly, I take  the sum of 600,000,000 gold marks for the liabilities incurred  and to  be  incurred  by the German Government in respect of services and supplies to the armies of occupation for the period  of the 31st March,1921, and,  adding it to the 3,600,000,000 gold marks specified on p. 1, I arriveat 4,200,000,000 as  the probable  total  burden to  the 31st  March,  1921,  or,  say,4J milliards of gold marks for the whole  period to the 1st May, 1921.                                      II.   m The figures for the current cost of an army  of occupation of 120,000 on thebasis  of the existing distribution  as between  nationalities may  be estimated  on asimilar basis.

     The amounts uncovered,  in so far as they are not met out of cash receipts by the Reparation Commission in respect of the period to the 1st May, 1921, are, in accordance with the priority granted by the treaty and the provisions of the Spa Agreement, a first charge on  all reparation receipts whether in cash or kind, after the 1st May, 1921, and they will, therefore, fall to be met out of the first instalment of the proposed annuity.     As regards current expenditure, as from the 1st May, 1921, I recommend that the liability be fixed at 240,000,000 gold marks  per annum, the sum contemplated by the Declaration of the 16th June, 1919, and that this sum should cover both the charges incurred directly by the Allied Governments and the value of the services and supplies to be rendered by Germany, this arrangement to be without prejudice to the right of the Allied and Associated Powers to claim separately from Germany any additional  military expenditure which  may have to be incurred as the result of any increase in the number of  men required above the  present  strength, or by reason of the occupation of  further territory,  in the event of such increase or further occupation  being necessitated by  failure on the  part of  Germany to  fulfil her obligations  under the Treaty of Versailles.     It is, in  my opinion,  essential in order to  curb extravagance in the  demands made  for such services  and supplies, and the consequent squandering of German resources which would otherwise be  available for reparation, that the cost of any such extravagance should  fall on  the Powers concerned in making the  demand. Further such an arrangement is  an almost necessary consequence of imposing a limit  on the total  amount  which  may be demanded from Germany in  respect of expenditure  directly  incurred, since if the system  of gratuitous  supply  were maintained concurrently with such  a limit, it  would  be  perfectly  easy for the occupying Powers to render the  limit nugatory by  making requisitions for the gratuitous supply of things which they had previously themselves  furnished.  On the other hand it is clearly  necessary that any arrangements for crediting Germany with the value of the service and  supplies furnished  must  provide adequate safe- guards against excessive charges, and proper security that the services and supplies themselves are actually forthcoming at reasonable prices.  It should not be difficult to secure this by means of an  arrangement, under which tariffs of the charges to be admitted would be subjected to the approval of  an Inter-Allied  Commission.   The German Government would be made responsible for seeing  that  the supplies and services were  forthcoming at the  tariff rates  and  for themselves bearing  any supplementary payments which, in the exercise  of this responsibility, they might find it necessary to make to German nationals.     The payment of 240.000.000 gold marks per annum would be a first charge on the reparation annuity,  and should be divided between the Powers taking part in the occupation on a basis to be agreed between  them.   Whether the distribution should be made in exact proportion  to the number  of effectives  employed by such Power from time to time in the armies of occupation, or in each proportion, weighted either  in respect of the comparative cost generally, or in respect of special expendi- ture in regard, say, to transport, which necessarily differs by reason of geographical considerations, or whether some arrangement might be devised by which  capitation rate would be allowed in respect of the armies of those Powers which take a com- paratively small share in the occupation, leaving  to France the balance of the  total sum, together with an advantage which may accrue from economies, are questions involving considerations of  a  technical character with which I do not feel myself competent to deal.   I have little doubt, however, that a basis of agreement could readily be arrived at by means of  a conference between the military authorities of the countries concerned.     I  have only to add that in my opinion it  is most  desirable that the cost not only of the armies themselves, but of the Rhineland  Commission and of the  Military, Naval  and Air Inter-Allied Commissions of  Control should be met out of the  fixedannual sum of 240,000,000 gold marks.[5277 cc-1]

ANNEX  VIII.                  Private German Property in Allied Countries.     There would have been no object in considering the legal aspect of this question had not one of the German delegates, in the course of our discussions, expressed the opinion (certainly in a discreet form) that it seemed of doubtful equity to use private German property abroad as a guarantee of the obligations imposed upon Germany by the Peace Treaty.     It is possible to deal with this briefly.     Throughout the  19th century  the law of nations  tended to a doctrine which finally triumphed at The Hague Conferences of 1899  and 1907 &quot; war can only involve the States which are belligerent, and the property and security of individuals must be strictly respected.&quot;     According to the rules of war finally sanctioned in 1907 by the signature of the heads of all civilised States, the rights and interests of individuals were  accordingly kept outside armed conflicts and under protection from their consequences.     But the whole world now  knows that the German armies and their  civilian authorities  in occupied territory  systematically, from the  beginning to the end of the war,  failed to  recognise this principle,  and thus provoked the  authors  of the Peace  Treaty to insert  provisions relative to the  liquidation of  private  German property in Allied territory.     It is essential at the outset of this report to recapitulate and  summarise the text of the  treaty and the regulations which it makes.     Article 297, paragraph (6) of  the Treaty of Versailles runs          &quot; (b.)  Subject to  any contrary stipulations which  may be provided for in     the present treaty, the Allied and Associated Powers reserve the right to retain     and liquidate all property, rights and  interests belonging at the  date of the     coming into force  of the present treaty to  German  nationals,  or companies     controlled  by   them,  within  their   territories,   colonies,  possessions  and     protectorates, including territories ceded to them by the present treaty.         &quot; The liquidation shall be carried out in accordance  with  the  laws of the     Allied or Associated State  concerned, and the German owner shall not be able     to dispose of such property, rights or interests nor to subject them to any charge     without the consent of that State.         &quot; German nationals who acquire ipso facto the nationality of an  Allied     or Associated Power  in accordance with the provisions of the present treaty     will  not  be considered as German  nationals  within the  meaning  of this     paragraph.&quot;     Paragraph (i) of this article adds          &quot; (i.) Germany  undertakes to compensate her nationals in respect of the     sale or  retention of their property,  rights or interests  in  Allied or Associated     States.&quot;     The same  principle is expressed in article 249, paragraphs (fe)  and (j) of the Treaty of Saint-Germain as regards the property, rights and interests of Austrian subjects;  289 and  292 of the Treaty  of Sevres as regards the  property, rights and interests of  Turkish subjects; and 177 (&amp;) and (j) of the Treaty  of Neuilly as regards the property of Bulgarian subjects.     The  right of  sequestration  and  liquidation  conferred  on  the Allied and Associated Powers  by these treaties,  which the enemy Powers have signed,  is thusbeyond discussion.     The liquidation of enemy property and  interests has  made much  progress in                        *the 300,000 tons still deliverable under the treaty will be ready for delivery, therelease of 325,000 tons to be laid down during the next 15 months would amount to avery close approximation to consent to the German request.    Further, the Allied delegates are prepared to recommend their Governments, ifnecessary, to consider making available  to Germany  of  ships  already  built anddelivered or  deliverable  under  the  treaty.   The precise extent, however,  of  suchconcession cannot be determined until the needs of the Allies for tonnage has  been further examined.
   England and the United States and has been decided upon in France under  the   law of the 7th October, 1919.       In Belgium, although sequestration could not begin to operate until after  the   11th November, 1918, fairly numerous realisations of enemy property and  interests   have been carried  out up-to-date,  and  the process  is  continuing,  according to  the   legislation on sequestration  now in force (statuts of the 10th  November, 1919, and   Royal Decree of the 18th  April, 1919).       A  Bill  relating to  sequestration  and  liquidation  of enemy property  will   probably be passed shortly by the legislature.       This Bill proposes the general liquidation of all enemy property and interests   existing in Belgium  and  admits of no exception except in certain cases which have   seemed  to involve  particular hardship.   Further, it establishes in favour of  the   State  the right of sequestration of these properties and interests.       The right of sequestration and liquidation of  enemy  property and interests,   accorded by  the Treaty of Versailles, is a self-acting right.      ^ No reason is apparent for which the Allied  Powers should renounce this right,   which  Germany has  recognised as  theirs.       Further, the  second  paragraph  of section IV of  article 296 of  the  treaty   provides that the net proceeds of the liquidation of enemy properties and interests   shall be  accounted  for  by  the Debt Clearing  Offices.  This  paragraph  runs as   follows :             &quot; The  proceeds  of  liquidation of enemy  property rights and interests       mentioned in section  IV and in the  annex thereto will be accounted  for through       the Clearing Offices,  in  the currency and at the rate  of exchange hereinafter       provided in paragraph  (d), and  disposed  of  by them under  the conditions       provided by the said section and annex.&quot;       Consequently, the Clearing Office must be able to rely oh this net balance to pay   off pre-war Allied creditors.       It may  be remarked  that article 18 of the  Belgian Bill on sequestration and   liquidation of enemy properties provides that the net balance  of the liquidation is   appropriated to the Treasury, to be dealt with in accordance with article 297 (h) of   the Treaty of Versailles             &quot; This  balance is charged, in accordance with the privilege conferred by       paragraph 4 of the annex to section  IV of part X of the treaty, for the purposes       and in the priority therein laid down.&quot;       This provision accordingly confirms the disposal of the proceeds of liquidation   provided by section  (A)  of  article 297  above mentioned, and  at  the  same  time   establishes the charge in favour of  Allied nationals provided by paragraph  4 of  the   annex to section IV of part X of the Treaty of Versailles, which runs as follows :             &quot;All  property,  rights  and interests of  German nationals  within  the       territory of any  Allied or Associated Power and the net proceeds of their sale,       liquidation  or other  dealing  therewith may  be  charged by  that Allied or       Associated  Power in the first  place with payment of amounts  due in  respect       of claims by the nationals of that Allied  or Associated Power with regard to       their property, rights and interests,  including companies  and associations in       which they are  interested, in  German territory,  or  debts  owing  to them by       German nationals, and with payment of claims growing out of acts committed       by the German Government or by any German  authorities  since the 31st  July,       1914, and before that Allied or Associated Power entered into  the war.   The       amount  of  such claims  may be  assessed by an  arbitrator  appointed  by       Mr.  Gustave Ador, if he is willing, or if no such appointment is made by him,       by an arbitrator appointed by the Mixed Arbitral  Tribunal provided for in       section VI.  They may  be charged  in the second place with payment of  the       amounts due in respect of claims by the nationals of such Allied or Associated       Power with regard to their property, rights and  interests in the  territory of       other enemy Powers, in so far as those claims  are otherwise unsatisfied.&quot;       Finally,  article 243 of the Treaty  of Versailles is expressed  in the following*   terms:             &quot; The following  shall be reckoned as  credits to Germany in respect of  her       reparation  obligations (a) Any final balance in favour  of  Germany  under       section V  (Alsace-Lorraine) of &quot;part  III  (Political  Clauses for Europe), and       sections  III and IV of part X (Economic Clauses) of the present treaty.&quot;
      Consequently, for the various reasons which have already been explained, the liquidation  of enemy properties and  interests  is clearly  a  quite  indispensable measure.      If, as has been explained, it is necessary to proceed generally to liquidate enemy property and interests, and if the legislation authorising such  liquidation must be of the widest  possible scope, it nevertheless  seems equitable  to  contemplate certain exemptions, in view of possible  quite exceptional cases.  Some alleviation  of the genera] law of liquidation might be made, when it is a question of small owners, of individual  properties  of  small  importance,  of furniture  or family  heirlooms,  of allowances or other forms  of assistance to maintain a livelihood,  or other exceptional cases involving special hardships.  These  are the only alleviations  which,  in our opinion, can be admitted  against the general law of liquidation.      It  would  have been interesting to give figures, as accurate as possible, as to the value of the proceeds  of liquidations of enemy properties and interests to  date, and  also of  properties not yet realised.  Such estimates would have enabled us to check those which Dr. Melchior produced before the conference, which may, we think, be fairly charged with some exaggeration; but the time naturally has been  too short to collect such statistics.      Is  it  possible  to  contemplate  uniform  procedure  for  the  liquidation  of sequestered enemy property and  interests in  the different countries?      It is almost impossible.      First of all, liquidations have already been carried out in England, the United States,  and  Belgium; it is the same  with  France.      Secondly,  each  country works  on  its  own  interpretation of  the   right  of sequestration and  liquidation under article 297,  section (b) of  the treaty, and not merely in virtue of its own internal legislation.     As to the charge created in favour of Reparation upon the final net  proceeds of liquidation, paragraph (c) of  article 243  of the treaty governs this charge.  ,  Consequently, after   the  proceeds  of  liquidation  have been  dealt  with  in accordance with the charges created by paragraph (2)  of section IV of article 296, by paragraph  (h) of article 297, and  by paragraph (4) of  the annex to section IV of part X of the treaty, the final balance in favour of Germany will be carried to her credit  under the  head of her  Reparation  obligations, pursuant to article  243, paragraph (c).     In summary, the  following conclusions are arrived at:       It  is impossible  to accede  to the two requests formulated by  Dr. Melchior, viz. :      1. That the Allies should decide  to stop further sequestrations;     2.  That, as regards sequestrations already effected,  properties not yet liquidated           should be restored  to their German owners, while compensation should           be paid to the German owners  in cases where liquidation has already           been carried out.     We consider  that  there  is ample ground for continuing the liquidations of German property and interests in Allied countries.     Dr. Melchior warns the Allies to be  careful, alleging that this policy means the ruin of the German budget, in that the treaty, as well as the German constitution, compels the Reich to compensate its nationals.  He supports his argument by figures, which are at first sight somewhat impressive.  He says that the  present  value of German property and interests in Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan  and  Belgium may well be about 9,661 million gold marks-a sum which would compel the German Government to pay its interested nationals  at least 90 milliards of  paper marks. The same view was expressed by Herr Paul  Warburg  at the Congress of  Bankers held  at  Cologne in October, 1920.  According to him  the obligation on the  Reich to indemnify German subjects (he is  clearly considering German property  in all the Allied  countries)  would  involve  an  unparalleled increase in  the  fiduciary inflation, he asserts that  the budget  for  1920 makes  provision for  compensation amounting to 131 milliards of paper marks, with the dollar standing  at 40.    There is, however, an important  reservation  which must  be made regarding these figures.   Dr. Melchior and  Herr Warburg both  commit the same error in wishing to charge the budget of one year with the heavy cost of these compensations. In Belgium, where the damages of war have been relatively considerable, interested persons receive bonds, bearing interest, with  a currency of five  years.  It is clearalready  that the redemption1 of these bonds  must be postponed  for  ten years, or
oelse they will have to be replaced by means of annuities spread over a fairly longterm of years.   Why should  not  Germany deal with her  nationals in the samefashion ?    Further, the Brussels conference had asked the German delegation to answer the three following questions :     1. How is Germany paying oft&apos; her  nationals who are owners of property, rights          and interests in Allied countries ?    2. How have these properties, rights and interests  been  valued?  Does  the          German  Government pay this  capital value  to its nationals in a lump          sum or by deferred payments?   Does it give its  interested  nationals a          negotiable acknowledgment  of  debt?    3. Is  there any  pre-charge on the Reichsnotopfer, or any  other tax, for these          amounts due to German nationals ?    Hitherto no reply has been given to these  questions.
