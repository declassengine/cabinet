(P 752)          From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,            1473                               3rd February 1921.                                (Received 8 p.m.)    Secret.   Afghanistan.  Following from Dohbs (? 1st February): -   &quot;&quot;At Tarsi&apos;s invitation I attended tea-party to-day at Anclki with Pipon, Musprattand Nawab to meet Jamal, who came  with  several Turkish officials.  Casual con-versation with Jamal lasted  three  hours.  He spoke  very  (? warmly) (? regarding)whole Turkish policy (? before) and  during the war,  and  bitterly about  accusationsof oppression of the Syrians  made against him.  He said  that Turkey was forced toarms by French and British refusal  of her overtures,  and  signed secret offensive anddefensive  treaty  with Germany, 24th  duly 191.4.  lie was interested in news of approaching revision of Turkish treaty, hut said nothing  would come of it unlessMustapha Kemal&apos;s party \vere taken  into council.   He  made no  attempt to explainhis presence here,&apos;or to  conceal his bitterness against Allies.  His manner, however,was extremely frank and pleasant.   I cannot tell Tarsi&apos;s object in arranging meeting,but as it was  practically public, news AVI 11 reach  India quickly,  and  perhaps  somecapital may be  made out of  it.  Tarsi  asked for another private  meeting  aboutquestion  of tribes.  I replied that  I had said  all I had to say at private (? meeting with) him and Nadir, and  that  I preferred official meeting  to receive their decision and make statement.  If we  found that they accepted our views  in tribal question,I should be prepared for private meetings afterwards. Tarsi  agreed, and we meetto-morrow.  He asks  me  whether I woidd  not  now produce my own Draft Treaty.I said I would  think  about it.  Offer may be  ruse to  waste time until  Russianratification arrives.&quot;
