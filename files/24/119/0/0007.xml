This Document is the  Property ofH&amp;rin&apos;.-3 iVlaiau/o Government               -      A&apos;TTB TTFTT---*^9th January, 1921.- -PBRMAJMBOT COURT CP IOTEP^iATIO NAL JUSTICE.mcrandum by the First Lord of tfro  Admiralty.         The Eoard of Admiralty have read the resolutionconcerning the establishment of a Permanent Court ofInternational Justice passed by the Assembly of the  Leagueof Nations at Geneva on the 13th December ,1920, and  theyunderstand that the Statute cf the Court has been submittedby the Council for adoption in the form cf a Protocol,  andhas been signed by this Country.  2.-    The Ecard of Admiralty are confident that HisMajesty^ Government will not recognise &quot;new, or at  a latermoment  , (as is provided for in the latter part cf Article26 cf the Statute of the Court) the compulsory Jurisdictioncf the Court, as such a step might have disastrous results-on British sea power *    This view is in accordance  withdecision (b) cf tho conclusions cf the Conference cfMinisters held on Monday, 18th October 1920 3 namely,&quot;That the compulsory aspects of the scheme should be resisted&quot;  3--    The ether conclusions of that Conference were  :-         (a)  That the draft scheme for the institution of               a Permanent Court of International Justice               was unacceptable from a British point of               view, and         (b)  That delay should be insisted on, on the               ground that the scheme could not be put  into               operation without the co-operation cf the               United States of America.  4.*-    As regards clause (b) , however, delay has apparentlynot been insisted on, and the position at present is thatthe Court is set up and that the Court may deal with disputescf an international character which are voluntarily  submittedto it by the authorities concerned, and that it may  alsc  give an advisory opinion on any dispute cr question which theCouncil of the League or the Assembly may cheese to  submit  toit (See Article 14 of the Covenant).         The Admiralty had understood from the conclusions  5--of the 18th October, with which they were in entire  accord,that the dangers cf the Court were recognised, even  thoughthe jurisdiction of the Court were voluntary and notcompulsory on both parties, but they desire tc emphasize  afew naval considerations.         Before doing so, the Eoard of Admiralty would,however, point out the dangerous tendency in the proposedScandinavian amendments to Article 12 cf the Covenant ofthe League cf nations towards making the submission  of cases to the International        Court of Justice ccmpulsorily,e*g. Norway has proposed that Article 12 shculo. read asfollows         &quot;   The Members cf the League agree that if there         &quot;should arise between them any dispute likely to         &quot;lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter         &quot;either to judicial settlement cr to a procedure         &quot;of enquiry and conciliation.         1   The judicial settlement shall be made by the         &quot;Permanent Court of International Justice mentioned         &quot;to Article 14, etc.&quot;                          ^
 6.-      In the  opinion of the  Sub-Commit tee which  studied the draft scheme for  an International  Court of  Justice, cit would be one of the Court&apos;s Important tasks  tc  contribute through its Jurisprudence  tc the  development of  International Law&quot;, Let.  the decisions cf the Court  cannot but have the effect cf moulding and- modifying International Law.   If such a process applies  to  the laws  of  war at sea, Great Britain, frcm a naval point cf  view, is predominantly concerned.   7**-    The practice cf Great  britain in several important matters, is different frcm the  practice cf the Continental Powers as regards war rules, cr for ether reasons is net likely to be upheld by  an International Court.   Tc  quote a few examples          Eight., of,. Search.   Groat  britain he Ids  (a)  $hat the presence with neutral merchantmen cf a public vessel cf their own State as esccrt and protector does net, in the  absence of special agreement, exempt  then  from belligerent  search; (b) further, Great britain  holds that resistance on  the part of the convoying ship renders all  the  conveyed ships liable to capture and condemnation.   Cn  these points (a and b) Great britain stands almost alone-          Blockades*   According to  the practice  of France and certain other States,  a neutral vessel cannot be affected by knowledge of the blockade unless she has actually been warned by one of the  blockading squadron and had the fact of the warning having been given noted on her papers* The practice of England and another group of States is different-    Generally  speaking the vessel is liable if she has knowledge of the  blockade,  however acquire do    Again the question !l  when is a  blockade effective&quot; is net  entirely free from doubt.    The  majority cf  Continental writers lay down awkward restrictions  which are net recognised by our Prize Courts,          Conversion on  higfr seas*   Again, in the matter of the conversion of merchant ships  into^armed ships cn the high seas, the British  delegates  tc the Second Hague Conference had to report - hWe  were met by a refusal to&quot;make any concession or  to  abate one  jot frcm the  claim to the&quot;absolutely unfettered exercise  of the  right, which  its&quot;advocates vindicate as  a rule forming  paSt of the existing&quot;law of nations^     In  these circumstances we felt  that we&quot;had no option but to  decline to adxait  the right9 and the result is that the question remains an open one&quot;.          B^J^i^J^XiLJ^^^s.*   The very distinct  line that the Prize Courts of this Country have  followed  is  of special importance to Great Britain-     The British Prize  Court decisions in the recent war have upheld the  &quot;right  of one &quot;belligerent to disregard the limits cf International Law &quot;and to retaliate against neutral commerce if the  other &quot;belligerent infringed  neutral  rights  of trade  to  the &quot;detriment of the first belligerent&quot;.  ,This was  vital in our retaliatory measures  against Prance at the beginning cf the Nineteenth Century and  against  Germany in the last  war.  Eut no International Court cf  Justice would ever  apply (see Article 38) such a rule of war nor be  likely  tc uphold the reprisals policy  in the Retaliatory Order in Council of March 1915-, as say, a development of recognised blockade rule.                                                 /Merchant. *. *.

Jbo,surrender^^^e being attacked and^ovl^sionJig^liej^J^safety of orew and passenters,         The danger of even the slightest relaxation of this rule bein^al lowed in consequence of the limitations of submarinesas fighting shins is apparent,,  and the interests  of  land&quot;  states on the one&quot;hand&quot; and maritime states with largo mercantilemarines are in this matter likely to be divergent.         Amongst the above are particular examples of divergence of -practice which actually exist, but it must be  emphasised that there is practically no question in International MaritimeLaw which could not be brought before the Court of InternationalJustice, and that that Court will in effect be able not onlyto re-mould existing laws but to control the development ofInternational Maritime Law in the future.  8.-    In another aspect, there is a danger, from the pointof view  of Sea  Power, in the constitution of a Court which claims to deal with Laws of War: firstly, it should not in factjudicially decide at all on Maritime Laws of War at sea until somecode of  the Laws of War at Sea is agreed to.. The faci/is that theCourt has been  created,and in the matter of Laws of War at Seahas no code by  which to act5 it will? however, attempt to givedecisions  on  such matters, 1,8, it will declare the Law? and it &apos;may ho foreseen that  a code of the Laws of &quot;war at sea will be created  by representatives of predominantly Land Powers whoseinterests will  be in  conflict with those of Great Britain; thegeneral  tendency will thus be to  create a code whioh will be jjl)fundamentally to the  detriment of British Naval interests, and(2) will involve ora the outbreak  of war a belligerent Naval power in quarrels with such neutrals as aooept the  code, who will be allthe more likely to be dragged into the war itself,   9.-   The Admiralty have been watoiling with anxiety the sudden development of this Permanent  Oourta   Unless the Britishview is  openly  stated  and the functions of the Court  strictly limited, some of the  principal methhds by whioh our Sea power is exercised may be seriously jeopardised, if not, indeed,nullified.   10,-  The proviso (Article 59 of the Statute of the Court) that&quot;the decision of the Court has no binding force except between theparties  and in  respect of that particular case&quot; may appear  atfirst sight to  be a satisfactory  safeguard against the  growth of a system of  oase law, but the  Court will naturally decidesimilar  cases on identical lines, and in actual practice thissafeguard is  likely to be illusory,         British practice, as stated  above, is not in severalrespects in accord with continental practice, and there is apossibility of  our finding ourselves  outvoted on important points and in a very awkward position at the outbreak of war in whichwe are belligerents.   11.-  Fundamentally, too, the Admiralty does net feel justifiedin accepting  the competence of a  Court which  creates a maritimecode&apos;of war relying on (2), (3) and (4) of\\rticle 38 of theStatute, namely:-                           &apos;         (2)  International oustom, as evidence of a general             practice aooepted as law;                                                         3.7
/        (Z)   The  general  principles  of law recognised by            civilised nations;         (4)  Subject  to the  provisions of Article  59,            Judicial  decisions  and the teachings  of the most            highly qualified publicists of the  various nations,            as subsidiary means for the determination of  rules            of law.   12.- In connection with the  word &quot;La?/1 in these clauses,the remark may bo made that  the important distinction between a law actually established and  a law which an internationaljurist any think ought to be established, is sometimes not clear;and \;hero&apos;&apos; international Law has been made definite by  judicialdecisions,  e.g. by rules  relating to Blockade and Contrabandof War which are applied  by the Prize Courts, this Country has its judicial precedents,  but these are, or may  be, in conflict with those of other countries.   13.-  It is understood the British Prise  Courts can  onlyexpound the Law for Great Britain, working  on cufctoraary rules and the case law of British and other Prize  Courts of repute0,for this reason the decision of a Court working as described in Article 38 of the Statute would seem (if any question ofoverriding validity or sanction arose) to be unsatisfactory,,   14;-  An attempted War Code is useless  whilst an importantPower like the United states of America is  still outside theLeague.   15.-  The Board of Admiralty have  seen the useful suggestionthat the International Court should not attempt to solveProblems connected with the Laws of War, but should devote  its--attentions to a new body of International Law for time  of peace,e.g. Communications and Transit, Public Health, Treatment ofNatives, Mediation in Disputes, etc,  The Admiralty, looking at the position of Great  Britain as a belligerent,&apos;solicitousas to the effective means ^hi-oh the Navy has of bringing pressure to bear upon an enemy being diminished, and recognising &quot;thatthe idea of the establishment of a Permanent Court of  InternationalJustice has to be reconciled with this national view,  desire  toemphasise this peace aspect of the work of  the  Court ofInternational Justice,   They would propose that the question should be examined as to  whether the  Court1s activities be confined to Peace International Law as opposed to WarInternational Law.   In the opinion of the  Admiralty,  so far  asthe Laws of V/ar at Sea are concerned, it is  very important  thatthey should be so confined.(Sd)   17.H.I29.1.21
    In  circulating  the  attached memorandum to my  colleagues,  I venture to calltheir  early and earnest  attention to it.   The  matter, in  my view, requires  legislation at the  outset of the  session, and  1  am anxious that  the  measure should  receivemention in the Kings Speech.
