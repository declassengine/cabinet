&quot;BUM\     JThte Dor.:?TTcnt Is the Property ofCP.  2 53G  ) J)   - His L.;r:anni3 Government.tir.i.1       ?fy the Secretary of State for India,DlUUxvJli X.Telegram from Viceroy, Home bcjtarlincn.1, to Secretary of Stale for India,dated $Ik February 1JJ21.The following is the weekly telegram :--Dei)gal.---The functions in connection with the Dukos visit passed oil&apos; suecess-fully. Influence ol&apos; visit on public mind undoubtedly reduced by presence ol&apos;non-co-operative leaders. Absence of spectators marked on all occasions, exceptpublic arrival, when fair turn-out. Visit provided dignified and seemly send-off forCouncil and served as rallying point for more stable element.(Section &apos;2, Taxicab drivers resumed work on ii itU January on grant of certainconcessions pending report, of Committee. 2Gth January, tramway employees struckwork and are still out. Strike amongst student class spread widely throughMofussil;Gandhi addressed letter to Duke of Counaught in which he emphasises that non-co-operation not at war with individual Englishmen, seeks not to destroy English life,but system which lias emasculated country in. body and mind and soul. Afterreferring to 0&apos;Dwyerism and Dyerism in Punjab, and wanton affront to Islamic (sic),claims non-co-operation is religious purifying movement. Das has issued appeal tostudents, urging them to come out of colleges and to wake up in the cause of freedom,Madras Congress delegates, on return from Nagpur, made great efforts to arrangeboycott Duke/s visit. Meeting held on Uth, day before His Royal f.lighness&apos;s arrival,and procession went through streets carrying banners and inciting people to boycott;language extreme and behaviour of crowds somewhat truculent; no serious breachof peace. &apos; Similar meeting arranged for next day, in hope that, it would draw peopleaway from line of route ; this complete failure and attendance not more than 200. Inevening, after His Royal Highness had passed, considerable number of people wentto boycott meeting, and in all some 8,000 or 10,000 may have been present. Theywere to large extent merely casual spectators, who completed day&apos;s amusement byvisit to rival entertainments. As serious demonstration,&quot; wholly ineffective. Attemptalso made to organise general strike among public utility services in city ; to persuadepostmen, scavengers, water and electric light workers to strike. Only strike actuallyoccurred among tramway men. Mass of people paid no attention whatever to varioussuggestions to boycott, and gave His Royal Highness hearty welcome whenever heappeared in public, and after failure of attempt ou this day non co-operationists madeno further efforts. The situation at the Buckingham Mills is not free from anxiety.Strike continues, and men will not abate demands. Management equally determinednot to recognise union, as at present constituted, and elaborate picketting preventsmen from coming in. Press message states 14 pleaders have suspended practice inGantur.Section 3. Central Provinces. Active agitation in support of non-co-operationgaining strength, principally directed to boycott of colleges and schools, to whichaction Calcutta students gave further strength. Movement spread and (sic) (? ing) atJubbulpore and disquieting feature attempt to undermine teachers. National schoolsbeing established in several places, and in Nagpur number of students in nationalschools said to have risen to 150. One member of Legislative Council resigned, andone title holder surrendered title. Pressure being exercised on.members of Council,and title holders and-social boycott in some cases being practised. Considerablefeeling regarding cow-killing, particularly Northern Districts, and some MunicipalCommittees endeavouring to suppress all cow-slaughter in municipal slaughter-houses.First meeting of Legislative Council, distinct success ; slightly jarring note struck in.connection with l)uke&apos;s visit, but otherwise proceedings passed off harmoniously, andstandard of speaking higher than last Council. Election of few unsuitable membersnot likely to impair usefulness of Council,Which contains a number of men ofcharacter working for success of Reforms in Government.Punjab. Extremists improving organisations and disseminating political, ideasamong rural classes. A Committee, with Lajpat Rai as President, having beenformed to cany on propagandist and other work. Propaganda agents active inJ ulluudur district delivering seditious speeches, particularly in recruiting area. Inview of the excitement caused, Local Government considered it advisable to declareJullundur district proclaimed area under Seditious Meetings Act. The movement totake forcible possession of Sikh shrines is gaining strength, and we have called for afull report from Local Government as to extent and measures proposed to deal with,it. Lajpat Rai has started second campaign for educational boycott. Held meeting100 2.21
on 25th January at Gujranwala attended by many hundreds of students freni Lahore,who returned in high slate of excitement. -Movement has had considerable success.Large anii-cow-killing conference held in Karnal attended by about 15,000 persons.. Delhi Mohamedan and Hindu leaders have enjoined that Mohamedans should reducethe number ol! cattle killed. Grounds for dissatisfaction among peasantry stated byollicer of experience to be (J) corruption of officials; (2) promises, real or alleged,made by officials and non-officials to men who had helped during war, which cannotnow be redeemed ; (o) compulsory return to villages of disbanded soldiers anxious tocontinue serving. We regard the position in the Punjab as having dangerouspotentialities, particularly among Sikhs in which community there is great unrest.Delhi. Political activity at a discount. No enthusiasm among merchants andtradespeople for hartals projected by local Congress Committee for Oth and 14thFebruary, but some demonstrations of this nature expected. Gandhi arrives onloth February to open Ajmal Khan&apos;s Yunani and Ayurvedic Tibbia College. Fracaslook place on 28th , January at tomb in front of Juma Masjid between number offrontier and trans-border Tulib-ul-Jlms and some local Ghuirmukallid Muslims. Inheat of religious argument one of the latter ran amok with large knife. Four menwere killed or died almost immediately from wounds, and live others lying wounded inhospital. Murderer and three companions arrested. Incident purely outburst offanaticism with no political significances. :Burma. School boycott situation unchanged. Mating Mating Sin, Burmarepresentative of Council of State, returned to Burma when on his way to Delhi.Fxposctl, both in Mandalay and on journey to Rangoon, to every kind of persecutionand annoyance, and returned from Calcutta on account of fear of social boycott of hisfamily. Social boycott likely to be used with more frequency and with.success inBurma. Boycott of foreign goods on increase in Rangoon. Mandalay reportsmarked growth, of anti-British feeling and anti-Government feeling on increase inlarge towns, but province as whole not yet noticeably affected.Section -I. Assam.-Student strike occurred at Gauhali and Sylhet Colleges andin few schools.Section 5. United Provinces. Local Government decided that district magis-1 rates shall prohibit meetings under section .144, Code of Criminal Procedure, inOudh districts of Fyzabad, Sultanpur, Pmi Bareli, Barabanki, and Partabgarh.Prosecution of three prominent local agitators for seditious speaking at Sultanpur andBarabanki, and of a fourth person, a Sadhu, for attempting to seduce police atSultanpur. Be ports show that Deoband students formed society whose members willwork as religious missionaries, objects being (I) propagation of true Islamic doctrinesby preaching and practice; (2) establishment of branches all over India;(3) furtherance of Khilafat (? cause), missionaries undertaking to establish&apos; KhilafatCommittees where they do not exist.Bihar and Orissa. Political excitement caused by non-co-operation agitationcontinues. Situation at Mazaffarpur easier, and hat looting iias not been resumed.Vigorous efforts being made to bring out students but with little success up to thepresent.Industrial areas quieter.Bombay.- Intensive propaganda among students coupled with results received inBengal have had appreciable results in Bombay, Poona, and KouJain. A few hundredstudents in (lie Konkan and about 700 from most of principal colleges in Bombayregistered willingness to non-co-operation, and difficult to say whether mere ebullitionol feeling which will not materialise.   Labour situation unstable.General. There are signs that non-co-operators are endeavouring to force thepace, which will be greatly accelerated if large number of students can be secured forpropaganda work amongst the masses. Probable that renewed attack on colleges andschools since Nagpur Congress largely inspired by desire to obtain in this wayadequate supply of agents. It remains to be seen how far they will be successful inthis object, but probability that movement will culminate in sporadic, if not widespread,disturbances. Our aim is, by giving fullest effect to views of legislature, and thusestablishing reality of reforms, to enlist support of moderate and sensible opinion.This, will be valuable in dealing with disturbances&apos;should such occur, but massescannot be directly reached in this way, nor is there any reason to believe that adoptionof this policy will influence extremist campaign. We are expecting very shortlyreplies of Local Governments to letter, of which summary was telegraphed last week,and shall then consider whether any steps other than those outlined in this arepracticable and desirable.tV*T&quot;&quot;&apos;&quot;&quot; .......- &apos;........../
