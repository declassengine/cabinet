CMCirculated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.    With Mr.  churchill&apos;s concurrence,  J. circulate to my colleagues  the following telegram which has  been addressed  to the  Secretary  oi&apos;  State  for  India  by  sir percy Cox.   Telegram from High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, to Secretary of State for India,                             dated 2dlh January 1921.     291 S.   Your telegram of the 18th January, 389, to India.   Persian  situation.It  is impossible  to  prophesy  what  precisely will  ensue on  the  withdrawal  ofNorperforce, as it depends on  two factors at present (? obscure), i.e.t firstly, whethertwo or three months hence Bolsheviks will  have the will and ability to (? undertake)military ^occupation  of North Persia,  and secondly,  whether, in the  last resort, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will still be prepared to incur some further  expenditure  in persia to save remnants  of  situation  (? and) greater loss.  (? As regards  the) firstproblem, the agreement  said to  have  been  concluded,  or on  the point  of being(? concluded), between  Soviets (? and)  Persia,  doubtless oilers no safeguard againstprosecution  ol&apos; Bolsheviks&apos; programme of  aggressive expansion,  nevertheless, it isdifficult  to  believe that  they will proceed to  extremities  immediately  after having-concluded such  an agreement with   Persia,  and  having  been  deprived,  by  thewithdrawal  ol! the  troops, of  their last  excuse for  armed intrusion  into Persia.It will  be remembered   that  they were  (?   expected to) occupy Tabriz  directlyit was  left  open,  but they  have not  yet  (? done so).   In  this connection  itis worth noting that, when the first news of our  intended evacuation was  telegraphedby Teheran merchants to  their correspondents here, general panic ensued; for it was regarded as  portending  loss  of  not less  than four  millions sterling  to  Baghdad.merchants,  in the shape of  outstanding^  or  stocks  of  merchandise left  in Persiawithout  hope of recovery.   This panic, however, in a general, measure  subsided  whenit became known that  Persia was on the point of concluding a treaty with the Soviets,as it was believed that such a treaty, combined with our retirement, would put an end to Bolshevik activities in  Persia and re-open trade route between Baghdad and Enzeli.This is doubtless  a (?  sanguine) outlook, but for many reasons it is greatly to  be desired that the withdrawal of Europeans from Teheran could have been postponed,or at all events left to take its natural course without pressure.   It  is easy to imaginethe lamentable picture of  apparent British impotence and collapse before the  Bolshevikmenace, which will be presented to the public of this region by the stream  of women-.and children trickling  down  Teheran-Baghdad road, under circumstances  of gravediscomfort  and  hardships, resulting from  severe winter  conditions, and  with  our troops following on their  heels.   It  would have been  iuiinitely-less  harmful if  the civilian evacuation could  have been deferred, at any rate until the immediate effect ofour military withdrawal, both on Bolsheviks and  Teheran public, had  become apparent; ,and then (if it  were inevitable) if it could have taken the form of  a gradual-exodus to or via Ispahan in the spring.   I  note  the. reasons given by His  Majesty&apos;minister  for putting that  route out of the question, but I shall venture  to revert to the subject later on.     As to  the question of  financial  assistance, I  understand  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government have.suspended all subsidies to Central Government,  and intend to cease financing South Persian Rifles from 1st April.   It is clear from the papers,  that this policy has been forced upon  the  Cabinet, by the insistence of the public at home  ondrastic reduction of expenditure.   But unless some alternative constructive policy can be devised, to counteract  its  destructive effect,  adoption of such a line of action will entail complete  collapse of  commercial position in Persia,  which it has taken genera-tions to establish.   It will react both. (?  commercially) and. politically in afghanistan and Mesopotamia, and in  the latter  case will ^greatly upset  the  calculations on which we have formed our Budget.  It seems to amount to this if His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are prepared to continue to incur certain expenditure in Persia to save remnants of our position, something can no doubt  be done and is worth doing.   If  they are not so prepared, but  insist  on withholding  all further financial assistance,   I see  no alternative  but to  evacuate our women and children, not only from Teheran, but from all towns in Persia, and simply leave those who will not come away or whose presence until the last moment is a necessity, to await the development of chaos.     Reverting to  Bolshevik menace, 1. am aware that  there is a  section of Persian public  in Teheran (corrupt group) who see in.  Bolshevism, as they see in other forms      3320   100  2.21
  of anarchy, golden opportunities for enriching themselves.  J am convinced, however,  that the people of Persia in  general are not  prone  to  welcome  Bolshevism, and will  hold out against it if given any solid foundation to stand on.       As regards Anglo-Persian agreement.  Fair and reasonable document as  it is,  it has  become such a red herring to the Bolshevik, and such a pretext,  Tor  Extremist  propaganda, that J agree with the Government of India that  we must drop it in its  present form as a basis of policy.  On the other hand, it is difficult to  conceive any  scheme of financial assistance calculated to save Persian situation which His Majesty&apos;s  Government could be expected to enter upon without protecting themselves by  some  agreement of same kind.       I now beg to (? submit  emitted) for consideration two lines of policy for adoption  according to circumstances.   The first is that we should not assume that all is lost in  Teheran.  The trend of recent intelligence reports regarding Bolshevik plans rather  indicates that they have other pre-occupations for  the present.  We should decide,  therefore, to  delay  evacuation of  women  and  children at any  rate until the  early  summer, then,  if it  proves (? word omitted), it;  should  take  the form of a gradual  exodus to Ispahan and Shiraz, but in co-operation with Bakhtiaris.  1 am aware that  here the main  difficulty lies in the question of transport, but it seems quite possible  that mule transport can  be collected at Ispahan, and a convoy of vans be sent up from  Bushire via.  Shiraz, on  which  route they would have  the  protection  of the South  Persian  Rifles.   Meanwhile, we should  rally our adherents at  the capital amongst  moderate  Nationalists  and  non-Bolshevik elements, who are   convinced  that  the  country  can only be saved from anarchy with our help.  We should devise another  agreement which the Majlis will accept, and on basis of  which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-  raent will continue to help Persia.  It  is quite possible  that  such an agreement  may  involve  our acquiescence  in a change of  Shah or change of  dynasty, and  J.  do not  think that we should hesitate in giving it.  In any case,  attitude of Bakhtiaris will be  an important factor, and I do not at all agree with the view expressed by His Majesty&apos;s  Minister that  they are essentially  unfriendly.   On  the contrary, I believe  they  are  fully alive to  advantages of  friendly relations with us,  and, provided their interests  are safeguarded and promoted, the majority of them could be got  to  participate with  us in any scheme for the saving of Persia from chaos.     Supposing that it is  decided  that (? word omitted) has gone too far  to admit of  the adoption of the above  policy, or if it is tried and fails, then I  think we must make  up our  minds to let  Northern Persia go Bolshevik if it wishes to; but in  that case,  provided again  that we are prepared to&apos;spend some money, 1 see no reason  why we  should not hope to maintain our interests and  effective influence in the  sphere  in  which they mainly exist,   and   which  I  should  include by a  line passing from  the  Persian  frontier near Khanikin, through Kermanshah, Khurumabad,  Ispahan, Yezd,  Kernian, and so  on, and I think our policy should be to stabilise situation in that area.  In fact, it seems to me impossible that we can  do otherwise than  endeavour to ensure  safety of our numerous ami  vital oil interests in this part of Persia, namely, near  Qasr-i-Shirin, in Pushtikuh, in Arabistan, and  in  Bakhtiari country.   Maintenance of close  relations with  Bakhtiaris  is essential to  both  parties, and  we must remember that Ispahan,  Yezd and Kernian  are now  in the hands of Bakhtiari  governois.  In the event of a  collapse of the  Government at Teheran, and  the  flight of the Shah, I think we should  (? allow the) Wali of Pushtikuh, the  Sheikh of Mohaminerah, and the Bakhtiaris to declare their independence, or their separation from  Government of Teheran, and should encourage them to make a three-cornered pact among themselves to  stand together to maintain their own interests and resist Bolshevik aggression.  We should probably (? do  omitted) well to have Kashgais (corrupt group)  in too.  All four elements  are  mainly (? tribal) and already practically independent  (? full stop). They would  only need  a hint to induce turbulent tribes (? to omitted) take action but for us it would  be important that they should act together.  Such  a confederation would offer a very  formidable bulwark  to Bolshevik aggression, as well as  protection of  our own material and  legitimate interests in  Persia.  If this  line of policy be favourably  entertained,  it  seems to  me that  we should do  all  that is  possible to expedite  improvement of  communications from South,  outwards,  namely, from. Khanikin to Kermanshah, from Mohammerali to Khurumabad, and  roads from Ahwaz, Bushire and Bandar Abbas.     I  would venture  to  suggest that, if  the above suggestions are considered  to provide basis for any constructive line of policy, representatives of all the chief British firms with commercial stakes in  Persia should be called together for discussion of  the subject, in order that it may be known what amount of co-operation may be expected from them.
