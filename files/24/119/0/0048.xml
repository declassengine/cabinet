(P 775)           From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,            1552                                5ih February 1.921.                                (Received 4 p.m.)     Clear the line.     170 S.   Following from Pobbs, 3rd February :--     &quot;1  presented complete  review  from  British  standpoint  of  Afghan  demandsregarding our tribes at fourth meeting yesterday.   Nadir Khan was present.  I setforth breach of faith  involved  in  these  demands  after assurances given  and effect which would be produced by publication  of correspondence,  also preliminary view ofGovernment of  India as laid down your telegram 127 S.   I said il: object of Afghanproposals was  to  bring our tribes  further  under  their  influence we could  not contemplate a single step in that direction, but that  although .1 did not admit theircontention that they would  be  disgraced by the abandoning of their claim  regardingtribes, I was willing to  consider any suggestion they.might  make for lessening thereproach  which  they anticipated.   I asked  them to&apos;formulate proposals more clearlythan  hitherto.  Nadir  replied,  that they required reversal  of our policy of  roadmaking  and station of the  troops in Waziristan and undertaking that troops shouldnot be stationed in future anywhere within independent tribal territory, also amnestyfor any past offences of Waziris, Mahsuds and Afridis.   When  I  said that this  wasimpossible,  Afghans said that further  discussion appeared useless, I warned them ofthe  consequences  of   refusal   of  British  friendship  as  outlined  in  end  of  my telegram 24 C. of 30th January.   Nadir replied, failing treaty we must expect frontier to be Hooded with arms  and  propaganda from pamphleteers next  spring and  also great increase of  trouble  from tribes.  Tarsi asked for  three  days before deciding  finalanswer as he has to attend  mourning  ceremonies for a relative.  There seems to belittle  hope  of their  receding and negotiations must  probably be broken off in four or five days. I  hope, therefore,  motor transport  may  now  be definitely collected atPehsawar with,  one additional  motor-car  for  Plying  Brigade  officers.    Kabulnewspapers  announce murder of Bravin at Ghazui 14  days ago when proceeding toKhandahar.&quot;
