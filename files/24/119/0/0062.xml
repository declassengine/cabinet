C.A B I HE IP.RfflRESENMIONS REGARDING &quot;THE EXTENSION OF       UNTOLQYIMT INSUiUNOE.go J8 by the Kin is tor    Lab our j.          With reference to Cabinet   (21) Minute 5, I think mycolleagues should know that representations are reaching me dailyfrom moot important organisations of workpeople with reference tothe serious situation which arises as a result of large numbers ofworkers exhausting the special eight weeks&apos; benefit provided underthe Unemployment Insurance Aot (1920).          I received yesterday a deputation from the Irishtextile Workers who set before me the very serious position withregard to unemployment in the Belfast linen Industry.    imongstother facts they mentioned that -     &quot;Even the mills whioh were running at the present time     &quot;were only working from 18 - 24 hours per week.  Dealing     &quot;particularly with the spinning end of the trade, there     &quot;were altogether 50 spinning mills in the North of Ireland     &quot;and 21 within a 6-mile radius from the City of Belfast.     &quot;Of the 21 mills, 12 had been completely stopped down sinoe     &quot;21st December, since when the workpeople had been idle ......     MThere was no hope of re-opening the establishments at the     &quot;present time.......  In the oountry districts there were in     &quot;all 29 mills of which 7 had been oompletely stopped and whole     &quot;families had been thrown idle, there being no other work in     &quot;the neighbourhood to whioh they could turn......  With large      numbers of people out of work, without resources of any kind     &quot;and with their benefit ooming to an end in a few days, the     &quot;deputation desired to press for benefit of some description     &quot;to be extended until such time as they oould again find     Employment......,&quot;          I also received yesterday a deputation from the NationalFederation of Women VJorkers, who pressed very strongly the followingproposal
&quot;That the payment of benefit should be oontinued to&quot;women who were unable to be provided with work and&quot;who were bona fide workersf and that the drain Bhould&quot;be aade on the re serves of the Unemployment Fund with&quot;a Government guarantee of repayment at some future&quot;date.&quot;          Finally I reeeived to-day a deputation from the UnitedTextile workers&apos; Association, oonneottd  with whioh are ninedifferent amalgamations in the I^noaahire Cotton Trade.   Theyhad previously desoribed the situation In Lancashire, in a letterto me, as follows:-          &quot;The present depression in the cotton trade is the          &quot;worst experienoed during the past 50 years.   A          &quot;number of our district sooleties are bankrupt.          &quot;They have spent on unemployment payment all their          &quot;oash reserves, realised their war Loan and other          &quot;investments, and in some cases have mortgaged their          &quot;buildings, and some of them have been compelled to          &quot;suspend all payments&apos;7.          This deputationt like the others, asked for theimmediate extension of the eight weeks1 benefit.(Initialled)  T.J.M.BTnislgy ef labour
