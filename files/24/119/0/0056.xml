Secondly; the year 1920 is a peculiarly unfortunate   selection from a statistical point cf view0   Beginning with an   unprecedented inflation of values it ended with an equally   unprecedented deflation, and the figures $f output furnished by   manufacturers mould lase much cf their significance cwing to the   wild fluctuations?          Thirdly, cwing to the omission of Agriculture it weald   be of no value  in  determining the relative taxable capacity   of Ireland,          Apart therefore from the great importance of reducing   national expenditure in  the coming year, the arguments seem   to be decisive  against holding a partial Census ef Production   for 1920.          The Board of Trade originally asked for a complete   Census of  Production for 1921 ftc be held  in 1922).,   To hold  a   partial and  a  complete census in consecutive years would have  been   an indefensible duplication of expenditure and the proposal  to   give the necessary statutary notice last December was accordingly   not pressed,                                   (Initialled  )A*C,   Treasury Chambers, S.V;.,     February .9th, 1921,
