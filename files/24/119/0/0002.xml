PART    L-THE   LABOUR    SITUATION.THE  GENERAL  SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.    The quietness of the  general industrial situation continues.  The strike of the elec-trical power engineers and other municipal employees at Ilford, referred to in last week&apos;sReport, was settled through the intervention of the Minister and the Chief Labour adviser on the 19th January.  Two minor disputes, which have been somewhat protracted, namely,the strikes of the tug-boat men on the Tees, and of the bakers at Swansea, have also been settled during the week.   The Court of Inquiry appointed by the Minister to inquire intothe causes  and circumstances of the dispute between the employers and workpeople inthe tramway industry * will begin to hear evidence at St. Ermins, Westminster, on  the26th January.    The report of the special sub-committee  appointed by the executive of the LabourParty and  the Parliamentary Committee of  the  Trades  Union Congress, on the 11thJanuary, to draft a &quot; definite programme and policy &quot; with regard to unemployment,has been approved by a joint meeting of these bodies, and will be considered by a specialnational joint delegate conference to be held at the Kingsway Hall, London, on the 27thJanuary.  The main proposals  of the committee are given below.   It will be seen that work, or maintenance, for the unemployed is  still insisted upon, as is also the paymentof an under-employment  allowance to al1 persons compelled to work short time.  TheLondon District  Council of Unemployed  Organisations! have also  met during the weekand decided to send a deputation to the  special conference.   There is reason to suppose that the District Council desire  the special conference to adopt a  &quot; down tools &quot; policyin the event of the Government refusing  to provide work  or maintenance for  the unem-ployed.  It is not anticipated, however, that the conference will decide upon any definitecourse of action at present, but if satisfactory action &quot; is not taken by the Government inthe meantime, the  Labour members of Parliament will endeavour  to bring the matter before the House of Commons  at the openng of the next Session.  The conference willprobably stand adjourned until  the 23rd February  &quot; to enable the executives of the tradeunions to take the opinion of their members in order to  decide on any further  steps thatmay be necessary to secure the adoption  of its recommendations.&quot;    The tendency of organised labour to &quot; mark time &quot;  during the next few weeks is alsoillustrated by the advice reported to have been given by the trade unions concerned to their members employed in dockyards, or other Government establishments, that they should fall in with the Government scheme for short-time working &quot; for the present.&quot;  Meanwhile,as a result of the introduction of short-time working, 2,000 unemployed are reported to havecommenced work at Woolwich Arsenal on the  24th January, and several hundreds at thePortsmouth and  Devonport dockyards.   The number of unemployed persons, however,continues to increase, and unemployment has now spread to the coalmining industry, wheremany are reported to be working short time.    The general effect of the present depression in trade on the character of current wagesnegotiations was  dealt with in this Report last week.  It is now reported that engineeringemployers in the Birmingham and Wolverhampton districts are reducing the wages ofmany of their women employees to the minimum rates fixed by the Stamped and PressedMetal Wares Trade Board.  This reduction amounts in some cases to about 8s. per week.Similar action on the part  of employers is anticipated in the Coventry district.  No general conclusion,  however, can  be  drawn from these facts,  which merely illustrate the thesisthat enforced reductions have occurred in  special cases only, and do not indicate a generalpolicy on the part of employers.  The general tendency  at the moment is rather towardsstabilisation.    Arising out of the International Miners&apos; Congress held at Geneva in August last, J  theexecutive of the  Miners&apos; International Federation met  in London on the 24th and 25th                    * See this Report, Vol.  Ill, No. 4,  22nd January, p. 81,                    t See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 3,15th January, p. 45,&apos;                    I See this Report, Vol. II, No. 7, 14th August, p. 238,
General  Situation-continued.January, under the presidency of Mr. Eobert Smillie.  Delegates were present from GreatBritain, France, Belgium,  Germany and Czecho-Slovakia.  At the meeting of the 24th,the general condition of the coalmining industry was discussed, and a resolution declaring that&apos;&apos; the socialisation of the mining industry in every country is of supreme importance &quot;was unanimously agreed to.  On the 25th, the situation of the coal mining industry inGermany was considered, and a resolution passed, which, inter alia, urged  &quot; the miners in every country to suppress overtime,&quot; and called upon &quot; the International Labour Officeto set up an International Control Board for the sharing and exchange of all raw materialsindispensable for the restoration of all countries.&quot;    The conference  of representatives of the International Shipping Federation  and theInternational Seamen&apos;s Federation to consider the question of hours of labour on board ship* commenced their deliberations, under the presidency of M. Albert Thomas,  Directorof the International  Labour Office, at Brussels on the 24th January.The Unemployment  Position.    Statistics. The  number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donationpolicies lodged in the United Kingdom on the 14th January was 299,505, comprising 298,963for men and 542 for  women.  In addition, there were 15,198 policies  lodged by short-timeworkers, 15,113 for  men and 85 for women.  On the 7th January there were 287,909policies lodged,  287,380 by men and 529 by women.   On the same date there were 10,870policies lodged by short-time workers, 10,855 for men and 15 by women.    On the 14th January in the United Kingdom 548,047 unemployment books, 303,665for males and 244,382 for females, remained lodged under the Unemployment InsuranceAct.  Compared with the previous  week, when there were 280,084 lodged by males and223,808 by females,  the increase is 44,155.  In addition, there were 570,993  books lodgedby short-time workers, 215,645 by males and 355,348 by females, an increase on the  previousweek of 111,038.    The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom onthe 21st January was 998,000.  A full  analysis  of  the unemployment  position will befound on page  112.    The above are  advance  figures provided by  the Employment  Department  and are subject to  revision.FEATURES  OF   THE  WEEK.General Topics.    Trade  Boards  Acts.-Strong criticism of the  Trade Boards  has  recently been putforward by various Chambers of Commerce and by employers.  The general objectionappears to  be  that they are not only unnecessary, but positively  harmful in their effects on industry.  During his  recent visit to Aberdeen, the Minister of Labour received adeputation from the Chamber of Commerce ;  and a strong protest against the applicationof the  Trade Boards  Acts  to  the  linen  trade  was  made  by Mr.  David  Douglas,chairman   of  a  local  flax spinning and weaving firm and  a  member  of  the Flaxand  Hemp Trade  Board,   who  acted  as  spokesman  for  the   deputation.  Mr.Douglas stated that  a  manifesto was to be presented to the Minister at an early date,on behalf of the flax-spinners and linen manufacturers of Scotland, asking that &quot; theindustry may be freed entirely from the dominance of the Flax and Hemp Trade Board,which was  foisted upon us almost without our knowledge, and certainly without any sort of consultation.&quot;  He criticised the Trade Boards as being &quot; the most perfect instrumentsthat could possibly have been invented for driving trade away from our country,&apos; and expressed the opinion that a reduction in wages was necessary if this country is to competesuccessfully with foreign countries.  He also stated that  the  local  committees formedunder the Act were useless, as the majority of the members have only the  most super-ficial knowledge  of the trade, and are,  therefore, not competent  to deal effectively withthe problems which arise.  * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 22, 27th November, p. 606, and No. 25, 18th December, p. 681.(B 16896T)                          &apos;                                  N 2
     Similar views are being ventilated by  manufacturers and  other business men  in Devonshire.  A deputation was  received by Sir Robert Newman, M.P., at Exeter, on the 15th  January.  The  trades  represented  were  dressmaking and  millinery, tailoring, grocery, brushmaking, paper bag  and box making, the laundry and the waste reclamation trade.   The deputation  asserted that  the  industries were  paralysed,  employees were out of work, learners  and apprentices were being dispensed with,  and whole departments were being closed as a result of &quot; this uneconomical  and arbitrary  Act.&quot;     On the 4th December, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce addressed a letter to the President of the Board of Trade, protesting against the extension of the Trade Boards  Acts, on  the  grounds that  it involves the  &quot; multiplication of expensive official machinery, resulting in no corresponding advantage  to the State,&quot; and also on the ground that &quot; bureaucratic interference with mutual wages arrangements between employer and employed  is inimical to the best interests of the industrial and commercial community.&quot; The association also urged the necessity for an immediate inquiry into the administration of the Trade Boards Acts and the general policy of the Ministry of Labour.  A reply to this letter from the  Ministry of Labour called attention to the  fact that the Ministers action in establishing  Trade Boards &quot; is controlled  by the statutes under which he  acts and by his responsibility to Parliament.&quot;   The conditions governing the setting-up  and administration of- the Trade Boards were also outlined, and it was stated that experience of their working did not suggest that they prejudicially affected the trades in which they were established.     In this connection, it should be noted that a conference was held on the 10th January, under the  auspices of  the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, when a  committee was  appointed to draft a  scheme for  co-ordinating the work  of all  Trade Boards.  Mr. Jack Jones, M.P., Miss M. Symons, and Mr. T. Mallon will represent the trade unions ; and Mr. H. Gosling, Mr. A. Smith and Miss Bondfield, the Parliamentary Committee.     Mining Industry Act, 1920. Mr. W. C. Bridgeman, M.P., the Secretary for Mines, has announced  that a  committee  has been appointed to administer the fund constituted under Section 20 of the Act, for the improvement of the social well-being, recreation and conditions  of living of  workers in or about coal mines, and the  promotion of mining educa- tion and research.   The committee consists of Lord Gorell, chairman ; Mr. A. Leslie Wright, of the Mining Association of Great Britain;  Mr. W. Brace, Chief Labour Adviser to the Mines Department;  Professor E. L. Collis,   Talbot Professor of Preventive Medicine, University  of Cardiff; and Mr. W. Walker, Director of Health and Safety, Mines Department.     Labour and Ireland. With reference to  the dispute between the executive of the Amalgamated Society  of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners, and the members of the Belfast branch* who were  expelled because of their refusal to cease work for those firms whose employees were being prevented from  working on religious and political grounds, it  is now reported that the  Provisional Committee formed by  the  expelled members have appealed to the Belfast District Committee of the Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades Federation, for &quot; moral and financial assistance.&quot;  They state that, as all constitutional methods have proved  of no avail, they will be obliged to take  legal proceedings to sub- stantiate their membership of the union.   This appeal has been considered by the District Committee, who decided to ask the Parliamentary Committee of the British Trades Union Congress for a copy of the report issued by the deputation who recently visited Belfast to inquire into the dispute.  It was also resolved that every endeavour  should  be made to bring about a reconciliation.    International Union of Ex-Service Men. At a meeting of  members of this union held at Bristol,  the trade unions and their attitude towards the unemployment problem were attacked, on the ground that they were in a great;  measure responsible  for  the state of &apos;&apos; semi-starvation &quot; to  which many ex-Service men  are now reduced.   A resolution waspassed, as follows :            &quot; That this meeting of members of the I.U.X., in view of the despicably selfish attitude of the      trade unions of this country, deem it necessary to protect our ex-Service men against trade union      autocracy by means of organisation. We, therefore, decide that from this date  we shall be known      as the Bristol and West of England Ex-Service  Men  and Workers&apos;  Union, and that our constitution      shall be revised accordingly.&quot;    The Bristol branch of the International Union came prominently inbo notice in  the summer of  1920 in connection with the disturbances among ex-Service men in Bristol atthat time.   It will be remembered  that a number  of members marched to London in      * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 18, 30th October, p. 50i, and No. 20,13th November, p. 553.
 July of that year, and were welcomed on arrival by Miss Sylvia Pankhursfs Communist organisation.   The resolution noted  above is  of interest as illustrating  the  anti-trade union tendencies of the current extremist agitations,  and the  predominantly local, as opposed  to national,  character  of extremist organisation.  The International Union of Ex-Service Men first appeared in the Glasgow and Clyde areas.     International Labour Office. It is announced that the Governing Body have decided that the third meeting of the General  Conference of the International Labour Organisation shall be held at the end of October next, instead of in April, as was previously arranged.* Unemployment.     Labour Policy. The Joint Sub-Committee on Unemployment appointed by the Exeeu- tive Committee of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee  of the Trades Union Congress, at their joint meeting  on the 11th January, have now prepared and issued their report which will be presented to the Joint Delegate Conference of the two bodies which is being held at the Kingsway Hall, London, on the 27th January.     A  large  portion of the report, which consists of 48 printed pages, is taken up in recapitulating the resolutions and recommendations on  unemployment which have been. passed  by the Labour  Party and  the Trades  Union Congress since 1917.f  Excluding this  historical matter   the  body   of   the  report  is  taken   up  with   a statement of  reasons for the refusal of Labour  to  co-operate with  the Government  in the official inquiry into unemployment, and of its objections to the short-time proposals put  forward by the  Government.   The most  important section is that dealing with a draft policy for the present emergency.   This, however, does  not contain more than an elaboration of the proposals outlined at the special conference of the Labour Party on the 29th December, 1920,1 ari^ m tne various resolutions  which have been  passed from time to time in  the last few years.     It is stated that a practical programme to cope with the situation must deal with the problem  of unemployment in two aspects:  it must  make  adequate provision  for  the maintenance of the unemployed and the under-employed, and it must make comprehensive proposals for the restoration of normal  production. As far as the first aspect goes, the report recommends that the  rate  of maintenance, including benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, shall be at least 40s. per week to each householder, and 25s. per week for each single man or woman above  the age of 18, with additional allowances for depen- dants ;  and that the payment of these  benefits should be continued unconditionally so long as a person, remains unemployed, provided that all reasonable offers of employment either through an Exchange or through  a trade union are accepted.  The reduction of the number of the unemployed by the adoption of training schemes where these are feasible,  and by bringing into  immediate operation those clauses of the  Education Act, 1918, which raise the age of school children, and provide for the  establishment of  continuation schools, is suggested.  It is also contended that relief works are wasteful and demoralising, and that a better method would be  a legal restriction of working  hours  to 44 per  week,  without reduction in wages, accompanied by a drastic limitation of overtime. Recommendations with regard to the organisation of the  requirements of public departments and local authorities are also put forward  in this connection;  and a special section  is devoted to housing, with particular emphasis  on the possibilities  of  the building guilds if they  are given a free hand by the Government.   The sub-committee have also gone into the question of the restoration of overseas commerce as the chief need of the moment.  To  achieve this, they demand an immediate resumption of  trade with Russia and of normal political relations with the  Soviet Republic; and the introduction of some policy which will enable European countries to recover, their economic  position.  In connection with this, theycondemn, such schemes as the Export Credit Scheme of the Government as being calculated,not to assist foreign countries to regain their economic independence, but to  enable british manufacturers to dispose of surplus products.    * See this Report, Vol. II, No. 14, 2nd October, p. 411.    f The report also contains in the form, of  appendices (1) the policy for the  prevention of unemploymentafter the war which was published by the Labour Party in 1917 ; (2) a draft of the Labour Party&apos;s Preventionof Unemployment Bill, and (3) the proposals for dealing with unemployment put forward by the Joint Sub-Committee, appointed by the National Industrial Conference, and presented to the Special Conference whichwas held at the Central Hall on the 4th April,  1919. In this section are also reprinted the recommendationsof the trade union side of the Provisional Joint Committee of the Joint Industrial Conference signed byMr. Arthur Henderson, chairman, and Mr. G. D. H. Cole, Secretary. *   I See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 2, 8th January, p. 21.
    The report closes by a summing-up of financial  considerations, since it is recognisedthat to put these recommendations into force would necessitate the issue of considerablesums of money from the Treasury;  and a demand is made that the Government shallrelease &quot; for the immediate  needs of the unemployed and under-employed workpeopleand their dependants, and for advances to  assist the revival of trade, the futile expenditureonarmaments and munitionsfor the subjugation of the peoples of Mesopotamia and Ireland.&quot;    All the recommendations and proposals contained in the report are condensed intothe form of resolutions to be submitted to the conference on the 27th; and these are published at the end of the report.    Relief of Unemployment. The position with regard to unemployment continues veryserious.   The proposals  for the working of short time in Government industrial establish-ments were put into operation on the 24th January.  The  attitude which the men con-cerned should adopt towards the proposals was considered at a meeting of workers&apos; repre-sentatives of the departmental Joint Industrial Councils held at the Ministry of Labour onthe 19th January.  A resolution was passed reaffirming the former decision of the workers to have nothing to do with the official scheme, and rejecting its principle.  The meetingexpressed the opinion that such a proposal  should have been submitted by the Government,in the first instance, to  the Industrial Councils, and that the procedure adopted by theGovernment violated the principles of the Councils and tended to destroy their usefulnessand purpose.   It further recommended the executives of all the unions to withdraw theirrepresentatives from the Councils.   Representatives of the official side of the Councils werenot present at the conference.   The greatest opposition to the  scheme comes from Wool-wich, where an &quot; all grade &quot; committee, uniting skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers,has been formed to organise resistance.   Nevertheless it has apparently been consideredexpedient to accept the scheme for the present;  and the advice of the  unions in this sensehas been adopted, pending the national decision on labour policy to be taken at the jointdelegate conference of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress on the 27th January.The grievance of the men at the action of the Government in enforcing their proposalswithout regard to the opinion of the  workers&apos; side of the Departmental Councils  has been officially  expressed in a letter from Mr.  Arthur  Henderson to the Minister of Labour.Mr. Henderson declares that the constitution of the Councils has been flouted, and thatno good purpose can be served by the workers continuing their representation upon them.     The  terms of reference of Lord St. David&apos;s Committee have now been extended in twodirections.   Firstly, the committee have been authorised to make grants towards approvedlocal schemes  to cover 60 per cent., instead of 30  per cent., of  the wages bill of the addi-tional unemployed men taken on for work on these schemes, and, secondly, the committee may now make grants in respect of work on roads, other than those  within the Ministry of transports  scheme for  construction or maintenance grants.  It is  understood that, as ageneral rule, the committee will not assist road schemes where the expenditure on labour is less than 50 per cent, of the total cost.     The special committee on unemployment  appointed by the London County council report that work already put in hand in relief of  unemployment, in the area covered bythe Council, involves an expenditure of approximately  300,000. When additional work,which has been sanctioned, is started, the expenditure will be increased to about  680,000.     Organisations of the Unemployed. A conference of organisations of the unemployedwas held on the 19th January at Walworth, under the auspices of the London DistrictCouncil of Unemployed Organisations. At this meeting, protests were made against  thegeneral attitude of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of  the TradesUnion Congress towards the unofficial committees of the unemployed;  and a complaintwas made against the  Council of Action.  The meeting reaffirmed the demand  for  fullmaintenance for the unemployed at trade union rates ; the immediate resumption of tradewith Russia ;  the summoning of a National Convention to press these demands ;  and, fail-ing satisfaction from the Government within seven days, the adoption of a general &quot; downtools &quot; policy.  Arrangements  were made for a  deputation to visit the special  LabourConference on the 27th January, and steps are also being taken to organise a demonstrationon that day.     An Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee has been formed at Nottingham with the objectof organising all the unemployed men and women in the city.Control of Industry.     Railways. The Associated  Society of Locomotive Engineers  and Firemen, and theRailway Clerks&apos; Association, have issued  a joint memorandum dealing with the Ministry
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 25, 18th December, p. 680.    of Transports proposals for the reorganisation of the railways, and with the  counter-    proposals and criticisms which have been put forward by the Railway Companies&apos; Associa-    tion, the Federation of British Industries, and the Central Council of Railway Stockholders&apos;    Associations.        In substance,  the memorandum gives  a qualified  approval to  the proposals of the    Ministry of Transport, but these proposals have obviously been considered by the unions    in their relation to the demand for nationalisation.   It is pointed out that nationalisation    has  always been considered by the unions as the only logical method of dealing with the    railways.  So far,  therefore, as the Government proposals tend  towards unification of    management and control, the unions agree that the proposals will undoubtedly secure great    advantages in economy and efficiency of working.  But they object that the shareholders    alone  will benefit by such economies, whereas  if the State acquired and  controlled the    railways, the community and the traders would benefit,  either in the form of lower rates    and fares, or by contribution to the revenue of the country.        With regard to the Boards of Management, the memorandum declares that these should    be composed of representatives of railway workers, and of the trading  and travelling public,    together with technical experts, and should be responsible, through the Minister of Transport,    to Parliament.  It is admitted that this is, in effect, equivalent to nationalisation.  The    proposal to provide for the election of members to the boards from and by the workers is    approved in principle ; the unions, however, reserve their right to criticise the details of    the  arrangement when formulated.   With regard to wages and conditions it is stated that    &quot; the  unions are astonished  at the suggestion  .  .  .   that the companies contemplate    the  possibility of under-standardising the rates of remuneration and conditions of service    which were only recently negotiated by the railway unions, and a committee of general    managers acting on behalf of the Ministry.&quot;  They warn the Government and the public    that any such  attempt will be resisted &quot; to the uttermost.&quot;  The establishment  of a    Ministry of Transport is welcomed as meeting a national necessity, and the belief expressed    that the continuance and development of its work will materially contribute to the recovery    of trade and commerce from the results of the war.        The  memorandum,  dated  the 20th January, is signed by Mr.  J.  Bromley, general    secretary of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and Mr. A. G.    Walkden, general secretary of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association.    Trade  Union Topics.        General Union of Textile Workers. It is reported that, after prolonged negotiations    the  Scottish Industrial Woollen Workers&apos; Union have agreed by a large majority to amal-    gamate with the General Union of Textile Workers.  The result of the ballot showed 2,180    votes in favour of amalgamation and only 39 against.  About 3,000 operatives are affected    by the change,  which is to take place immediately.  The Scottish  workers are to  have    autonomy in domestic affairs,  and will be known as the Scottish district of the larger    organisation.        An amalgamation of two districts already within the union is also reported.  A ballot    vote of the members of the Colne Valley and the Huddersfield districts  showed  a  large    majority in favour of  amalgamation.  A joint committee for the two districts have  been    appointed, consisting of nine representatives of the  Huddersfield district,  and five of the    Colne  Valley district.  The arrangement is to take effect from the beginning of the present    financial year.        Union of Post Office  Workers. With reference to the recent decision of this union to    adopt a strike policy and to inaugurate a strike fund,* it now appears that some of the    members who  opposed  the strike  policy are  determined to  secede from the union    if that  policy is persisted in.   At  a  mass meeting of telegraphists and  sorters held    at Terry&apos;s Theatre, Strand, on the 23rd  January, a resolution was carried in favour of    secession from the union, and the formation of a separate association, without a strike    policy, to &quot; promote and protect the professional interests of members.&quot;  A resolution    rejecting the strike policy has also been passed by the members of the General Post Office    Parcel Office (Sorters&apos;) Branch.  The policy of the union, which has only been in existence    in its present form for eighteen months, has also been severely criticised by Mr. H. Dubery,    general secretary of the Federation of Post  Office Supervising Officers, and by others, who    insist  that the strike policy does not represent the general spirit of the  union.
NEGOTIATIONS   AND  DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.    Building  Trades Operatives (National).-A report lias now been received of the last meeting of the National Conciliation Board for the Building Trades.  The Board consideredthe question of rates under the Southern Counties Area  Scheme in connection  with anapplication by the operatives concerned for an advance in rates of Is. an hour.   Owing tothe fact that the rates in the London district are 4d. an hour above the  highest grade rateunder the Southern Counties Area Scheme, there is  a strongly marked tendency to extend the London rates beyond  the London area.  The  Board have decided  to recommend theSouthern Counties Area Joint Council to  raise certain Grade A towns under their scheme into a super-grade in order to meet the difficulty.    An appeal by the operatives of the  South-Western Regional Area for an increase ofrates was strongly resisted by the employers&apos;  representatives on the ground that, in viewof the general condition of trade, it was not possible at this stage to consider any general increase of rates.   It was pointed out that the Cornwall County Builders and Allied TradesEmployers&apos;  Association had  already  broken  away from the South-Western Federationof Building Trades Employers on the ground that rates were too high.  The Board decidedto refer the matter back to the South-Western Area Council, with a recommendation thatthe Council should have the assistance  of  a deputation from the National  Board when considering theniatter further.    Reference has already been made in this Report* to the suggestion that the employers&apos;and the operatives&apos; sides  of the Board should  consider the advisability of  withdrawingtheir applications for variations of rates as from the 1st May next, and the possibility of coming to an agreement on the stabilisation of the present rates of wages for a period of12 months.  It is understood that  steps have been taken to ascertain the feelings on thispoint of  the  master  builders&apos; associations and the building trade unions throughout thecountry,  and that the matter is  to be considered further at the meeting of the Board onthe 14th March.    Painters (North-East Coast and Mid-Durham). Three months&apos; notice has been givenby the operative painters  to terminate their special agreement with the employers in theNorth-East Coast and Mid-Durham areas.  Apparently it is their intention to throw intheir lob with the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives.   This action of thepainters should probably  be considered in relation both with the negotiations at presentin progress for the formation of an Area Joint Council for the  Building Trades for theNorth-East Area, and also with the proposed  reduction of painters&apos; wages in. this area by4:d. an hour from the 1st April.    Shipbuilders (National). At a conference in London on the 21st  January, the Ship-building  Employers&apos; Federation rejected  the wages  claim put forward by the Federationof Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, and refused to agree to a stabilisation of wages for six months.f  They took the view that they-could not agree to the proposal for stahilisa-tion in view of the  varying piece-rates operating in different yards,  and of the greaterinstability  of  contracts as compared  with the  conditions in the engineering trade.  Sofar as action in regard to the wages claim is concerned, it is expected that the Federationof Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades will not  press the matter further at the moment.    Railway  Shopmen (National).-As has been previously reported,! following on theagreement of  the  28th September, 1920, between the National Union  of  railwaymen and the craft unions, a joint sub-committee was  appointed some months ago, representingthe unions  concerned and  the railway  companies,  bo elaborate the details of a  nationalsettlement for railway shopmen.  The latest developments appear to show that agreement on  the question  is still a matter  of great difficulty.   The Amalgamated engineering union  declined to be represented on  the sub-committee,  so  long   as  the  NationalUnion  of  Railwaymen  were  associated  with  the  proceedings.    The  negotiating committee of  General Managers  consequently suspended further  participation in thediscussions until  the unions had ^composed  bheir  difference, and  requested  a  definiteassurance, before  another  meeting,  that the Amalgamated Engineering Union would abide by the decision of  the joint committee.  This intransigeance on the part of the Amal-gamated Engineering Union is blocking the progress of negotiations, the previous delays                    *  See  this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 3, 15th January, p. 49.                    f See  this Report, Vol. II, No. 16, 16th October, p. 458.

IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT  THAT  WHILE THE  NATIONALUNION  ARE ENGAGED IN  ATTEMPTING, WITH  OTHER UNIONS, TO  NEGOTIATE WITH THE RAILWAYCOMPANIES  ON  A NATIONAL BASIS OF WAGES AND CONDITIONS, MEMBERS OF THE amalgamated engineering UNION ARE ON STRIKE FOR  DISTRICT CONDITIONS, AND ARE RECEIVING  THE OFFICIALSUPPORT OF THEIR  EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  THE QUESTION HAS BEEN ASKED WITH WHAT AMOUNTOF SELF-RESPECT THE  NATIONAL  UNION  COULD RESPOND TO THE APPEAL OF THE amalgamated engineering UNION NOT TO PREJUDICE THEIR MEMBERS ON STRIKE  WHEN AT THE SAME  TIME THEAMALGAMATED  ENGINEERING URN&quot;ON DECLINED TO RECOGNISE THEM IN NEGOTIATIONS.

PART  II-THE   WORK  OF  THE  MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL  RELATIONS  DEPARTMENT.               ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED  TRADES.    Electrical Cable  Making.-The Joint Industrial Council met on the 19th January.At the request of the Electrical Trades Union, the Council decided to recommend that as many eight-hour shifts as possible, without overtime, should be put into force, with a viewto relieving  unemployment.  The  Cable Makers&apos;  Association  suggested that a noticeshould be sent to Government departments and large municipalities, pointing  out that acertain number of firms, with whom they had in the past done business, were not paying the rates of wages agreed by the Council.  As, however, the trade union side wished toinclude on this list a member of the association, who is not paying the agreed rates tohis women workers,  the question was left over to the next meeting,  by which time it ishoped that the firm will have decided to pay the Council rates.  The trade  union sidestated that the Independent Cable Makers&apos; Association have asked for  a  meeting withthem in the near future.   Further, the  trade union side  proposed  themselves to meet and discuss their future policy towards the Independent Cable Makers&apos; Association.    With regard to  the Ministers letter on  short-time  working the Council decided totake no action.    Wrought Hollow-ware. The Industrial Council met on the 10th January to  considerthe suggestions contained  in the Minister of Labour&apos;s letter on unemployment.  certain of the operatives&apos; representatives expressed the opinion that the suggestion put forward by the Government for  dealing with this matter was at best a doubtful palliative, andwould only serve to spread  distress among a greater number of workers, so causing increaseddiscontent.  The chairman stated that,  in his opinion, the duty of  the Council was toconsider the conditions  prevailing in the industries represented by tL? Council, and toendeavour to agree as to the means  which could best be  adopted to alleviate the distressalready existing and likely to arise.   It  was  resolved, on a  motion from the operatives,that the Council, realising that the  present unemployment  could best be solved by thecomplete opening up of trade in Europe, strongly urged upon the Government the needfor stabilising the exchange in various European countries.  A motion put forward by theemployers, that the employers in the industries represented be recommended so to  adapttheir arrangements as to give employment to the maximum number of workpeople, wascarried with two dissentients on the workers&apos; side.                   WOODWORKING AND FURNISHING TRADES.    Cooperage.-The London District Council, ab their meeting on the 18th January, had before them the letter from the Minister of Labour on the question of short-time working.They decided to recommend that the earnings of workers employed on piece-work shouldbe limited to such an extent as would bring their weekly earnings  approximately downto the day-work rate, that is,  5 5s. 9d.                  BUILDING AND WORKS OF  CONSTRUCTION.    Inter-Departmental Building  Labour Committee. At the  request of the building labour Committee, the General Post Office have nominated an officer to represent theinterests of the department on the committee.

They decided not to countenance  apprenticeship by agreement
(B 16896T)See also p. 96 above.as an alternative to apprenticeship by indenture, and considered a report on progress insetting up local apprenticeship committees.   A letter was received stating that  the Presi-dent of the Board of Education would address the Industrial Council, on the 11th  February,on the Education Report.    Heating and Domestic Engineering. At a meeting of the Emergency Committee of theJoint Industrial Council on the 18th January, the secretary of the workers&apos; side reported the unsuccessful efforts of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to effect a settlement of  the dispute between  the heating and domestic engineers and theplumbers on the Manchester  Corporation housing schemes, and it was decided to request the Minister of Labour, or the Chief Labour Adviser, to receive a deputation.   Sir DavidShackleton interviewed the deputation on the 19th January.    The deputation inquired whether the Minister would consent to the institution of aCourt of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act.  The Chief Labour Adviser pointed outthe inadvisability of this course, having regard to the attitude of the operative  plumbers,but promised to consult the Minister of Health with a view to the publication of the factsrelating to the case.  If, after consideration, he decided to proceed with the  matter, andthe Minister of Health concurred, he proposed to inform, the plumbers of the intentionto issue a statement and to  give  them an  opportunity  of  expressing their views.  Thedeputation undertook to furnish a  statement of the history of the dispute.    The Education Committee  of  the Joint Industrial Council met on the 18th January.A suggested scheme, prepared by an official  of the Board of Education,  for minor courses for apprentices, and the system of instruction by correspondence, were discussed.   It wasdecided to appoint a sub-committee to go into the question.   At the request of the Employ-ment Department, the committee agreed to copies  of the indenture form in use in theindustry being distributed to  Juvenile Employment Committees.  It was decided that thesub-committee should draw up  a short introduction giving the  conditions of employmentin the industry.                                 FOOD  AND DRINK.    South Wales Bakers. The strike at Swansea has continued during the week.  A jointconference of representatives of the master bakers and the Swansea Labour Associationtook place on the 20th January, when the following resolution was passed :           &quot; That representatives of the employers are prepared to recommend to their meeting on Sunday       afternoon next, that the men shall resume work on the existing terms, and that within a fortnight       a meeting shall be convened  of the employers and  the operatives to discuss the whole  situation de       novo with the Mayor as independent chairman.&quot;*    Success has been attained in  limiting the  dispute to the bakers, and in creating an atmosphere likely to lead to an early resumption of work.  Further negotiations betweenthe national and district secretaries of the operative bakers&apos; society and the master bakershave been arranged.    Fishing Industry (Grimsby). Following on an interview between Sir David Shackletonand a deputation representing the fishermen, introduced by Mr.  J. Sexton, M.P., a further communication has been sent to the employers asking them to reconsider their decision regarding a joint conference.  It was arranged with the deputation that they would notify the department whether their committee would agree to suspend handing in notices pending a reply from the owners, but no information on this point has been received.                                   TRANSPORT.    Road  Transport. On the 14th January, at a meeting in Nottingham of the NorthMidlands District Joint Industrial Council, covering the  counties of Nottingham, Derby,Leicester,  Lincoln, Rutland  and  Northampton,  an  agreement was reached concedingan advance of 46&apos;. per week from the 3rd January, making the new minimum rate for carters68s. per week.    Furniture Removing. The  Interim Industrial  Reconstruction Committee met onthe 20th January.  The principal business  was the deferred application from  the tradeunion side for 15s.  per week increase in wages, with a proportionate increase in allowances.The employers stated  that, owing to the continued trade  depression,  it was still quite impossible to grant any further  increase, and they suggested that the application shouldbe deferred for another three  months.  The trade union side resisted this, and maintained
that, owing to the very low rate embodied in the agreement of December, 1919, which has just expired, there was a case for, at any rate, an immediate increase of 5s.  The employerspresent promised to submit this again to their association, and it was arranged that a further meeting of the Committee should be held on the 14th February.    A letter  from the Minister of Labour,  recommending the working of short time  inview of the present trade depression, met with strong opposition from the workers&apos;  side.It was stated that the proposal would not prevent unemployment, but would only mean a reduction in the wages of those who still remained at work.  It was decided to send a letterto the Minister stating that it was the practice in the industry to retain as many men  aspossible during a slump, but  to withhold any reference to the Ministers suggestion  of adefinite short-time policy.                                    TEXTILES.    Silk. The Industrial Council met on the 19th January.   It was agreed that a further communication should be addressed to the President of the  Board of Trade,  pointing out the serious condition of the industry due to the unrestricted importation of silk goods and the amount of unemployment and short time  obtaining in the various districts.    The  industry have  decided  to take no further action in the matter of preparing aspecial unemployment insurance scheme.    The  Council endorsed the principle of  works committees, but decided that the  con-stitution of such committees should be determined  by individual firms.  The  questionof co-operation with Juvenile Employment Committees  was referred to the education committee, in order that a scheme might be drawn up in consultation with the employment department.    Wool (and Allied) Textiles. A special meeting of the Industrial  Council was held onthe 19th January  to  consider the question of unemployment.  The  Council have  now decided to appoint a special sub-committee to draft a contracting-out scheme to providebenefits for unemployment and under-employment.  The committee will also considerthe possibility of taking steps to tide over the immediate difficulties of unemployment.    Woollen Trade (Scotland). Awards Nos. 403 and 404  of the Industrial Court providedthat rates thereby determined should not be varied before the 31st March, 1921, but that,in the event of unforeseen changes, either side might apply on or before the 1st September,1920, for revision of rates.  It was submitted that the operation of the Rent RestrictionAct, and the operation of those clauses of Awards Nos. 403 and 404 which altered the basisof calculation of piece-prices, had caused unforeseen changes.    The  Court decided that the advance in the cost of living due to the operation of the rent Restriction Act could not be held to be unforeseen in  the sense of the Awards, and considered that cases of individual hardship would be more appropriately dealt with by direct negotiations between the parties than by a general decision. (Award No. 597.)                                     MINING.    Lead. A  conference, presided over by Mr.  McKerrell, was held in Glasgow on the13th January, between the Wanlockhead and Leadhills Mining Companies and the NationalUnion of Scottish Mine Workers.  The employers&apos; representatives said that they were  atpresent carrying on at a loss, and a reduction of wages was necessary.  The trade union representatives replied that the miners  were not prepared  to  submit  to any reductionof wages, but ultimately, on the chairman&apos;s suggestion, each side undertook to place before their constituents a proposal that the difference should be referred to an ad  hoc  Court  ofArbitration.    Tin.-The Joint Industrial Council met on the 14th January.  The question of thecondition of the industry was discussed, and the employers&apos;  side suggested that thereshould be a 10 per cent, reduction in wages.  The trade union side asked whether such areduction would, enable the mines to keep working.  This question was doubtless promptedby the position at the Tincroft Mine, which has just closed down, although the workers have been &quot; throwing back &quot;  a proportion of their wages since October.  The trade union side also asked w nether, if a reduction was  agreed to, the amount lost by the lowest-paid workers,  who are only getting 45s. a week,  could  be regarded as a loan to be repaid whenconditions improve.   The  employers were  not prepared to give an immediate  answer,and the meeting was adjourned until the 28th January.
                             PRINTING AND  PAPER.    Printing. The present constitution of the Industrial Council was inaccurately statedin the Report of last  week.

Local Authorities1 Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales). TheProvincial Council for the East Midlands area held their annual meeting on the 19th January.Officers and an Executive Committee  were elected for  the ensuing year; and matters arising out of the putting into operation of the grading scheme, adopted in August last, were considered.

Officers and a Standing Committee were  appointed ; and arrange-ments were made for. the Standing  Committee to elect from among themselves persons toact as deputations from the Council to local  authorities in cases of failure to put intooperation the  Councils recommendations, or of receipt of notice of intention to withdraw from the Council.    The  Provincial Council for the  Southern  Home Counties met  on the 21st  January.The local authorities in the area have been classified in five grades,  and a minimum wagefor adult able-bodied men has been fixed for  each  grade.   At this  meeting considerable progress  was made with the classification of employees in each  grade.  Three classes areto be provided.   Class A is to receive the minimum wage appropriate to the area ; Class B,consisting of employees  of greater skill, or employed on more arduous work, is to be paid2s. a  week more than the minimum ;  and Class C, consisting of employees on skilled work,is to be paid 6s. a week more than the minimum.     The Provincial Council for South Wales and Monmouthshire  met on the 18th January.Two  members of  each side of the National Council were present to hear and determine  a difference between the two sides of  the Provincial Council in regard to an application fromthe trade union side for an advance of    per  hour to all classes of workpeople, or its equivalent to  weekly paid men.  After hearing  each side, the  deputation recommendedthat  an advance of 2d. per hour be made to all able-bodied men, 18 years  of age or over,as from the first pay-day in January, 1921.   It was stated that each side of theJProvincialCouncil would abide by the decision.     Corporation Employees (Edinburgh). The employees of the Edinburgh Corporation,who had received war bonus in accordance with Award No. 101  of the Civil Service Arbi-tration Board, claimed an additional bonus in accordance with the terms of the Civil ServiceNational Whitley Council Cost-of-Living Committee&apos;s Report, dated the 8th May, 1920.The Industrial Court  decided, subject to certain observations,  that the position of the claimants was not one of such hardship as would justify any general addition to the existingwar bonus.  (Award No. 601.)     Electricity Supply. The National Joint Board  of Employers and Staff Members meton the 22nd January.  It was agreed that the resolutions adopted by the  representativesof the outstanding undertakings in the East Midlands area and of the Electrical PowerEngineers&apos; Association,  at the conference held at Nottingham on the 16th. December, be endorsed, on the  undertaking that any anomalies or difficulties  arising in connection withthe  settlement which were referred  to the department  should  be  communicated by thedepartment to the National Joint Board.  The  employers&apos; representatives reported thatat a  conference of employers&apos; representatives of the National Joint Board, District joint boards and District Interim Joint Committees, held on the 6th and 7th January, it wasresolved that  the National Joint Board should not deal with matters relating to the com-
mercial and clerical staffs.

GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.    Trade  Union Sides of Departmental  Industrial and Trade Joint Councils. The repre-sentatives of the trade union sides of the Departmental and Trade Joint Councils whoattended the conference on the 9th January held a meeting on the 19th January.  Thesecretary subsequently addressed a letter to the Minister, stating that, as the Governmentwere not prepared to discuss any alternative scheme to that promulgated by the Cabinet,this refusal deprived the Councils  of their function and purpose.  Accordingly the con-ference had decided to recommend the executive councils of all  unions to withdraw theirrepresentatives from the Departmental Industrial and Trade Joint Councils.*    Air Ministry Industrial Council. The meeting  of  the Council,  adjourned on the5th January, was resumed on the 19th January.  The chairman explained the proposedmethod of  working the short-time  scheme.   Mr. Henderson then stated on behalf of thetrade union side that the unions were not prepared to participate in working the scheme,which, in their opinion,  would promote  inefficient and uneconomical working, and woulddepress the standard of life of the lower-paid workers below the subsistence level.  More-over, the trade union side claimed that,  as the total number of unemployed that could be absorbed under the scheme in the Air Ministry establishments, was between 300 and 400,the scheme could not be considered as a serious  proposal  for meeting  unemployment.Mr. Henderson further said that the Cabinet, before issuing instructions on  a proposalinvolving such complicated issues, should have consulted the unions through the IndustrialCouncil.   Their action had undermined  the position of &quot; Whitley &quot; Councils.  He paid a tribute to the official side for the spirit in which the proceedings of the Council  had alwaysbeen conducted, and expressed  the hope that the present issue  would  not prove fatal toits existence.    Admiralty Industrial  Council. The Council met on the 21st January.  Mr. E.

Hethanked  the chairman and the official side for the  courteous treatment accorded to thetrade union side during the life of the Council, and after the chairman had replied, themeeting closed.                            MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.    Gloves.-k meeting  of the Interim Industrial  Reconstruction Committee  for theGlove  Industry, which has now received recognition as a Joint Industrial Council, washeld on the 17th January.  Discussion took place on the question of the adverse effect ofGerman competition.  Mr. Stone, of Nottingham, addressed the Council  on the position,and outlined the methods which are being  adopted to  obtain  remedial  legislation.  Onthe question of the short-time proposal, it was decided that no action need be taken, asshort time has always been adopted, and is at present in operation, in the trade.  A com-mittee was appointed to draw up  a new constitution.  A committee consisting of repre-sentatives of workers was appointed to report on the position of outworkers in the trade.    Lace. The secretary of the Midland Counties Lace Manufacturers&apos; Association  called to discuss the present conciliation machinery in the lace trade, and the possible formationof a Joint  Industrial Council, either for  the lace trade in Long Eaton and District, or forthe whole trade organised in sections.   He reported that he did not consider  the presenttime opportune for setting up a Council, as his association are satisfied  with their present                                * See also p. 100 above.
Board of Conciliation.  They would not be willing to proceed with the formation of a council for Long Eaton and District unless its findings in the matter of wages and conditions were legally imposed upon all lace manufacturers in the district.    The secretary has sent the department particulars  of a scheme which is at present being discussed by the lace employers,  dealing with unemployment, under-employment,sickness, accidents, and superannuation.    Co-operative Workers. In connection with a dispute between the Southern Sectionof the Co-operative Union, Ltd., and the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers,a meeting between the parties, under the chairmanship of a representative of the depart-ment, was held on the 18th January.  The general president of the union put forward theworkers&apos; case.  The application for an increase was based on the increased cost of living,and also the rates which are being paid by the Co-operative Union in other parts of thecountry.  The union are also making a claim on behalf of the craft and transport workerswhom they claim to represent.  The employers replied that the offer made by the hours and Wages Board, of  1\ per cent, increase on  the proposed Grocery and Provision trade board rates, was quite equitable and should  be accepted by the union.  The meeting was adjourned and  a separate meeting of  the Hours and Wages Board was held,  at which aresolution was  passed that the society could not increase the  offer already made.   this resolution was conveyed to the union, and a  deadlock appeared likely.  The union repliedthat they could not accept so low a percentage, but would not be uirwilling to accept asatisfactory percentage on the Trade Board rates for all their members.   They finally agreedto submit their difference to arbitration and, after some  difficulty, the Chief ConciliationOfficer was able to persuade the Hours and Wages Board to agree to this course, subjectto the approval of the societies concerned.  A final decision is to be given at a meetingon  the  25th January.  A  question arose as to the arbitration  proceedings, the Boardwishing the matter to be referred to the Industrial Court, whilst the union desired a singlearbitrator.  It  was decided, however, that a deputation  from  each party should go intothis question with  the Chief Conciliation Officer on the 24th January.    Hospital Workers (London). In July last the Industrial Court issued Award No. 371,in settlement of a  claim for increases in wages and altered conditions made by the Dock,Wharf, Riverside and  General Workers&apos; Union and the National Union of General workers on  behalf of their  members employed by the  chief London hospitals.  The unions  havenow raised the  questions of setting up machinery for dealing collectively, instead of  indi-individually, with hospitals and of higher wages for the more highly skilled workers.  they also complain that the domestic staff of the Royal Waterloo Hospital are not  receivingwages nor working hours in accordance with the award.    The honorary secretary of the British Hospitals Association  reports  that his associa-tion have appointed a London Regional Committee, on. which practically all the importanthospitals are represented.  The committee have not so far dealt with industrial matters,but the suggestion was made that possibly they would consider the appointment of a sub-committee for this purpose.  He wishes to discuss the matter  further with the RegionalCommittee.    Mr. Hanson, of the dockers&apos; union, stated that there is a good deal of unrest amongsthis  members employed in hospitals, especially amongst the more highly skilled workers,such as laboratory  assistants.   It appears that the union members also comprise engineers,electricians, carpenters, joiners, stokers,  general labourers, domestic staff including&apos; cooks,wardmaids,  scrubbers and  cleaners, porters, and theatre staff.  It was arranged that theunion should forward  to the department  a clear statement of their grievances, a copy  ofwhich  will be sent to  the Regional Committee.    Reduction of Wages (West Bromwich).-k dispute has arisen at the  works of Mr.  A.Posthlethwaite, West Bromwich,  manufacturer of metal washers, owing to a  proposed reduction of the rates of wages paid to the  women workers.   Some 30  women, engagedas machine workers and  power-press workers,  are concerned.   On the 12th January, the firm posted up  a notice of  proposed reductions, and on the 14th a notice was displayedshowing the amounts.  The women, members of the Workers&apos; Union, ceased work imme-diately the  amount of reduction was known.  The union attempted unsuccessfully  tointerview  the firm, who have rejected the intervention  of the Chief Conciliation Officer.The reductions  amount to over 50 per cent,  in the case  of girls of 14 and 15 years,  and,in the  case of adult women, where 42s.  5d. was previously paid for a  47-hour week, 30s.was offered.  The  Chief  Conciliation Officer now reports that  the firm have  offeredftheStamped and Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board rate of 9d. per hour for a 47-hour week.
                                                                            *       Reduction of Wages (Birmingham). The Chief Conciliation Officer, Birmingham, andthe National Federation of Women Workers, have reported that the Birmingham employers,members of the Birmingham and Wolverhampton  Engineering Employers&apos; Associations,have posted notices of a reduction in the rates of women&apos;s wages from 43s. Qd.  per week to the Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board rate of 9d. per hour.  In response to a request of the National Federation of Women Workers, the department are in com-munication with the Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federations to ascertain whetherthe employers are willing to agree to a further conference of the parties.     Needle, Fish-hook, Fishing  Tackle  and Allied  Trades. The Industrial Council  meton the 18th January and discussed the question of the wages of boy workers.  Anunfor-unfortunate position has arisen owing to  a misunderstanding with regard to an offer made bythe employers in March last, the union being under the impression that this offer was agreedupon and was meant to be included in a grading  scheme recently drawn up, while theemployers took the view that there was no signed agreement.                              PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.     Insurance Officials. The  strike of insurance  officials in the service of the GeneralAccident, Fire  and Life Assurance  Corporation  continues.   On  the 19th  January, theMinister  received a deputation from associations of non-manual workers, who stated thecase of the Guild of Insurance Officials, and  requested the  Minister to set up a  Court of inquiry.   The  Minister promised to ask the directors of the  corporation to discuss thesituation with him, and indicated that a Court of Inquiry was not practicable at present.The deputation also brought up the question  of establishing a &quot; Whitley  &quot; Council for theinsurance profession, and the Minister promised to get into touch with the general managers of the leading companies in order to ascertain their views  on the proposal.                                       GENERAL.     Short Time. In addition to the cases  previously nientioned,* the action taken byJoint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees in connectionwith the letter from the department dated the 31st December, 1920, is as follows :             Cocoa, Chocolate, Sugar Confectionery and Jam. The trade union side stated that they  could        not usefully discuss the matter at the moment, as the whole question was to &quot;be considered by the        Parliamentary Committee  of  the Trades Union  Congress.   Both  the trade union side and the        employers pointed oat that the  practice of working short time during trade depression  was        customary in this industry.            Manufactured Stationery. It was stated that short  time  was general in  this industry.   The        Committee decided to take no further action.            Scottish Joint Council for Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services. The Council decided to take        no action.            Lead Manufacturing. The Council decided that a letter be sent to the Minister stating their        disapproval of the suggestions. It was stated at the meeting that some individual firms have, through        the works committees, arranged for short time to be worked.            Hosiery. The Council decided to take no action, as the employees represented by the Council        are not affected by trade depression.            Match Manufacturing. The Council decided to take no action.            Making-up and Packing  of Textiles for Export. At a meeting of the London District Council        of the Export Packers and London Cloth Workers on  the 17th January it was stated that 10 per cent.        of the  employees in the cloth-working industry were unemployed, and 90 per cent, on short time.        The Council passed a recommendation that, with a view to easing unemployment in the industry, a        joint meeting of employers and employees be  called to discuss a general system of short time.            Needle, Fish-hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. The Council decided to take no  action,        in view of the fact that many firms were already on short time.            Heating and Domestic Engineering. The Council decided that the departments letter be referred.        to the sub-committee dealing with unemployment insurance.                                                                 i     Hours of Employment Bill. The  Minister is  in communication with the  chairman of the National Industrial Conference Provisional Joint Committee, to  arrange an  early meeting with him and with the chairmen of the employers&apos; and labour sides for the purpose of discussing  the Hours of Employment Bill, in order to secure as large a measure of approval as possible, before the introduction of the Bill into Parliament.

GENERAL  DEPARTMENT.                                TRADE BOARDS.  .                                   PROCEEDINGS.     Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board  (Great Britain).-Th.Q Central, the South Wales and the South-Western District Trade Committees considered the suggestions of the Board for the variation of the minimum rates of wages.   The workers&apos; representative in all cases were in favour of the suggested variations, but the employers&apos; representatives were opposed to them at the present time.     All three Committees considered and approved  the  Board&apos;s proposals to  vary  the minimum rates for apprentices, mainly by the alteration of the classification and conditions of apprenticeships.     Coffin Furniture and Cerement-Making  Trade Board  (Great Britain). The B *ard rejected  a motion to propose to vary the rates in operation for female workers in the cerement-making section of the trade? They also agreed to record that the representatives of employers, and the representatives of workers  in the cerement-making section of the trade,  were opposed to fusion, but that the representatives of workers in the coffin furniture section were in favour of fusion.     Linen and  Cotton Handkerchief and Household Goods and  Linen Piece Goods Trade Board  (Great  Britain).-The Board proceeded to fix general minimum time-rates and over- time rates for all male workers employed in the trade, but resolved to defer consideration of the  question of fixing piece-work basis time-rates for female workers.     Made-up Textiles Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board adopted the recommenda- tions of the Classification Committee  with  regard,  to the classes of  workers to be termed skilled, and agreed to propose to fix minimum rates of wages for male  and female workers.     Paper Bag  Trade Board  (Great Britain). The Administrative  Committee considered a letter from the Minister on the subject of short time, and agreed to reply that the problem of unemployment in the trade had been considered by the employers and  workers, and they were taking such action as appeared best to meet the situations which arose.     Pin, Hook and Eye and Snap Fastener Trade Board (Great Britain).-Th.e Board agreedto invite representatives of the Button-making Trade Board (Great Britain) to meet them,to consider the question of the consolidation of these two Boards.     The  Administrative  Committee  considered  the  question  of  co-operation  betweenJuvenile  Advisory Committees and the Board, and agreed that the  Juvenile Branch be requested to submit definite suggestions to  them.     The committee agreed to inform the Minister they are of opinion that, wherever possible,examination of application for permits of exemption should be carried out by members ofthe Board, but  that where such  action is  impossible, arrangements  should be  made  byinvestigating officers.            FIXING  AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM  RATES  OF WAGES.     Flax and Hemp Trade Board (Ireland).--Tk^ Board have issued a Notice of  Proposal,dated the 20th January, to fix general minimum time-rates and general minimum piece-rates for certain classes  of male workers.          The general minimum time-rates for male workers  employed  as roughers, hemp-breakers, flax-       dressers, yarn-bundlers, or piecers-out over 18 years of age, and loft yarn driers, are, in the case of       those employed within a radius of 10 miles from the City Centre, Belfast, from Is. 2d. to Is. 5d. per       hour;  in the case of those employed within the County of Cork, from Is. Id. to Is. %\d. per hour;       and in the case of other workers, from Is.  \\&amp;. to Is. i\d. per hour.  Lower rates are proposed for       machine boys, doffers, and learners at machines and in  the preparing and spinning branches of the       trade.   The rates proposed for all other workers, to correspond  with those mentioned above, are       I0d., 9cZ., and tyd. per hour, respectively, with lower rates for those under 18 years of age.

General Industrial Situation. Reports record generally a further increase in the volumeof unemployment and short-time working, and although the reports from some districtsare more hopeful, there is as yet no evidence of a general revival of the demand for labour.The only industries, apart from the coal industry, in which employment can be considerednormal, are the carpet, glass, pottery, and enamelled and galvanised hollow-ware trades.    Shipbuilding and Engineering.-Re^Govt&amp; from  the Clyde,  Tyne, Tees  and Wear.show  that  unemployment in the  shipbuilding and allied  industries is steadily increasingowing to a  lack of orders, cancellation of contracts, and the joiners&apos; dispute.  The work ofriveters and platers in some yards has now reached a stage where it cannot advance until some  joinery work is completed.  On the Mersey,  the prospects are regarded as  poor;shipbuilding firms have very few orders on hand, and there is a distinct tendency to post-pone  Work on account of the high cost of production.  A contract for re-conditioninga large liner has been secured by a Liverpool firm, and this should provide work for a largenumber of  men for about nine weeks.    In South Wales the improvement  in ship-repairing  work at Swansea has  not been maintained, and at the moment the position is not so good.  At Barry  there is a  slightimprovement, more particularly among skilled workers.  On the other hand, the position at Newport has deteriorated, and at Bute Docks,  where considerable numbers of bothskilled and unskilled men are unemployed,  there is no  indication of an immediateimprovement.    Sheffield report that unemployment is now abnormal in the iron and steel  industry,and that most firms  are resorting to short-time arrangements varying from three to five days per week.  On the other hand, employment on the Tees is increasing,  several  firms in this area having restarted some of their furnaces.  There is no change in the tinplatetrade.  The position in the  engineering industry generally in the North-Western Divisionis described as fair, but the textile machinery section is  very active, and employers are understood to have large orders on their books.    Textile and Clothing Trades. The report from the North-Western Division states thatthe position  in the cotton  trade remains  unchanged.  The prolonged period  of under-employment is giving rise to much hardship among the operatives.  The  first distributionof grants from the surplus fund of the late Cotton Control Board was made at the end oflast week,  and the grants, though small, have been  beneficial to many workers  who havebeen wholly unemployed for several weeks.    There  is no change in the  woollen  and  hosiery  trades.   The slight improvementpreviously  reported in the lace trade appears to be maintained. More orders  are being received, and this, together with the  stabilising of prices, is reacting favourably on this industry.   Employment in  the boot and shoe trade is still very unsatisfactory. While
 a few firms are reported as working normal hours, the majority are working three days per week.  Prominent  manufacturers  hold that no improvement  can be looked for before March.     Transport. &quot;Work at the docks on the Clyde is reported to be very  slack owing to a lack of cargoes, and low freights, and an increasing number of vessels are being laid up. There is also a considerable amount of surplus labour available at all the  ports in South Wales.     Miscellaneous Trades. Unemployment in London is becoming increasingly acute, and while the depression is affecting all  trades it appears to be most severely felt in the tin box making, furniture, leather and food products trades.  The London Central Exchange for the Building Trades report that, while there is still an unsatisfied demand for bricklayers, plasterers,  and tilers, there is a falling off in the demand for carpenters and joiners.     Salisbury report that a very large number of agricultural workers remain unemployed. The opinion is expressed that, as a result of the recent rise in the minimum rates, farmers have in many cases reduced their staffs to an extent not compatible with proper cultivation     Labour Reductions. Croydon  report  that  the  Aircraft Disposals Board have  dis- charged 150 men, most of whom were employed as engineers&apos; labourers.   At Enfield, the Edison Swan  Electric Co., Ltd., have discharged a further  200 men.   Richmond report that the Isleworth  Rubber Co., Ltd., have closed down.   At Chelmsford,  the Hoffmann Manufacturing Co., Ltd., are understood to be discharging workmen at the rate of 200 per week.     Owing to the completion of a Government contract, 500 men employed in the shipyards at Wivenhoe and Rowhedge have received notice to terminate their employment.  Oswestry report that the Porthywaen Lime Works have closed down, involving the discharge of 250 men.  At Dumfries, Messrs. Arrol-Johnston, Ltd., motor car manufacturers, are discharging 225 workers. Women&apos;s Employment.     General Situation. Available statistics indicate further increases of unemployment and under-employment.  Though the serious position is everywhere emphasised, there is a slightly more hopeful note in some  of the reports.    Local Reports. The North-Western Division  report continued acute depression  in the cotton trade.  At Aston it is  stated that the situation  is going from bad to worse, three large mills have notified  their  intention of going on organised  short time.  The number of  workpeople totally unemployed at Darwen continues to increase.  At Nelson, Oldham and Wigan, however, a more optimistic view of the situation is taken.  At Oldham two mills have notified their  intention of working full time, and a firm of cotton manu-&quot;facturers at Wigan, who  have been closed down for about six Aveeks, have re-started 130 weavers, with the hope of more being employed.    The wholesale clothing trade continues very depressed,  but there are  slight signs  of improvement.  At Crewe the prospects in the underclothing and shirt factories are said to be brighter.  Other industries in the district remain severely depressed, especially the hatting industry at Denton, soap manufacture at Birkenhead,  and  tailoring and jute manufacture at Barrow.    Serious unemployment still exists in  Liverpool, where  a firm of  tobacco merchants have dismissed nearly 1,000 women and girls.    In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division slight improvements are also noted from the cotton  textile  centres.  At Todmorden  extended  Christmas  holidays  are over, and work has, to some extent, been resumed, although there  are still 2,800 women  claiming unemployment insurance benefit. At Hebden Bridge orders are beginning to come through, but stocks are said to be heavy and employment will not be materially affected yet.    The Woollen textile trades, and the wholesale clothing trade, with which are connected the fustian lining and cord cloth trades, are still reported from all centres to be severely depressed.  In Morley there are 3,200 women on the live register, with every  prospect of a further increase.    At Beeston there is a slight improvement in the lace and net trade, and workers resident in this district have resumed full time in lace finishing  at Nottingham..  At Long Eaton, however, the lace trade is practically closed down, and at Basford there are over 1,200 short-time workers,  and a total number of 1,500 unemployment insurance claims.   At Nottingham all the staple trades continue depressed, but a slight improvement  in the    (B  16896T)                  v                                           P  2
making-up trade is noticed.  The live register is,, however, increased,  owing to furtherfirms closing down or going on short time,  Severe unemployment continues to be reported from Leeds.     The South Midlands and Eastern Division report little improvement in their stapleindustries. At Wellingborongh only two factories have resumed  work in the boot andshoe  trade, though there is  a slight improvement at Kettering.     At Braintree 150 women are to work short time at the silk factory of Messrs. Courtaulds,Ltd.   The bespoke tailoring trade is reviving in this town, and at Colchester a revivalin the wholesale clothing is expected shortly for the  Spring trade. Hosiery firms areslack at Loughborough,  where over 700 women are claiming unemployment insurance benefit.  At Reading, Messrs. Huntley  and Palmers, Ltd.,  biscuit manufacturers, have informed the Exchange that a number of workpeople  will be stood off at an early date.     The engineering and rubber industries in the West Midlands Division show no improve-ment. At Bromsgrove the engineering and gas appliance trades are slack and there arelarge increases in the number of claims.   At Selly Oak the cycle manufacturing trade isvery slack, and practically all women employed by Components, Ltd., have been dischargedor put on short time.  Metal machinists and cycle workers  are unemployed at Sparkhill.Leather work continues slack at Walsall, and the hollow-ware trade at Wolverhampton.Reports from the pottery centres are not quite so good as they have been.     Severe depression and unemployment continue to be reported from all factory areasin London, specific instances being tin box making, leather work, jam manufacture, rubberwork, the furnishing trade, printing, brush manufacture,  tailoring, dressmaking, shirtand collar manufacture, and  all the clothing and needlework trades.     The clothing and other  trades are depressed in the South-Western Division, the live register at Bridgewater standing at 507 owing to slackness amongst collar  and shirtmachinists and boot operatives.   At Eastville  (Bristol), tailoresses, corset manufacturers and  soap makers  are working on  short time..  At  Swindon,  Salisbury, Southampton,Plymouth and Exeter the tailoring trade remains depressed.     Short time is  reported in the tinplate  trade in Wales, although in some places, atGorseinon for example, there is said to be some improvement.   At Swansea the numberof tinplate workers unemployed is increasing, and there are 444 claimants to unemploymentinsurance benefit at Llanelly.     General depression  is reported from the Northern Division where biscuit makers,tin box makers, woollen  operatives, printers and ropery workers are slack.   At Carlislethere are  350 full-time and 1,070 short-time claimants  to insurance  benefit.   At Kendalthe Women&apos;s Sub-Committee have considered the question of domestic service,  and advise that applicants under 25  years of age should be considered suitable for this employment,even if they have only had industrial experience.    In Scotland, generally, there appears to be little change. The slackness in the stapleindustries such as  the textile, calico printing, and hosiery  and clothing trade continues.Heavy  unemployment  continues  to  be  reported  by the Glasgow  Exchanges.  AtDunfermline approximately 1,500 linen workers are on short time.   At Kilmarnock andKirkcaldy the  textile workers are resuming work after  the holidays, many, however,  on short time.                     LOCAL  EMPLOYMENT  COMMITTEES.    Employment and Resettlement. Reports from committees show that generally the localauthorities are making progress with schemes of relief &quot;works  The committees, however,are continuing to approach authorities with a view to more extensive schemes being carriedout   The Preston  Committee report that, while progress is being made with relief schemes in the Borough of Preston,  the surrounding urban and rural authorities are apparentlydoing nothing to meet the distress in their own districts   Great Yarmouth are urging the necessity for affording the fishing industry favourable  opportunities of trading with countries bordering on the Mediterranean, in order that unemployed labour may be absorbed in preparing commodities for export    Ex-Service  Men. The  Accrington  Committee, in  considering  the  question  of theemployment of disabled  ex-Service men, had their attention drawn to the  possibilityof old men being discharged  to make room for ex-Service men, a member stating that hehad such a case under observation   The committee were of opinion that employers shouldnot discharge their older employees to make room for ex-Service men, but should, as faras possible, make vacancies for disabled ex-Service men without recourse to this method.
    It was brought to the  notice of the Dumfries Committee that, in some instances,employers were deterred from creating vacancies for disabled men by the feeling thatif they offered a smaller wage than the usual rate this would probably be termed &quot; exploit-ing the men&apos;s pensions.&quot;   It was suggested that in the event of an employer and employeeagreeing to approach the committee to fix a fair wage, the committee should be in a positionto give a decision, which would not, however, be binding.      OUT-OF-WORK  DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.    Out-of-Work Donation.-Retiims by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office,  Kew, for the week  ending the 13th January,show 305,164 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  283,651 16s. Id.    Unemployment  Insurance. The number of payments of  unemployment insurance benefit made at local offices during the week ending the 7th January was 575,628, involving an amount of  318,305 9s. lOd.            DISCHARGED AND  DISABLED  SAILORS AND  SOLDIERS.    National Scheme.-!]]) to and including the 19th January, 23,753 certificates have beenissued to employers under the scheme.  The undertakings given by these employers cover262,145 disabled ex-Service men.    The Divisional  Controller for the Northern Division reports that,  while the numberof disabled ex-Service men on the live registers in his area has increased by 70, the positioncannot be considered unsatisfactory in view of the prevailing industrial conditions.  Severalcivic committees have now been formed;  they  are taking active measures to reduce thenumbers on the registers, and their efforts so far have been successful.    The Divisional Controller for Wales draws particular  attention  to  the  fact  that, &apos;although the present  industrial depression has rendered thousands of men unemployedthroughout the division, it does not seem to have affected disabled men.  It is confidentlyexpected  that, with  an improvement in the industrial situation, the disabled  registerswill be almost cleared.                               JUVENILE  BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.    Norwich. The  present period of industrial depression has  been thought by manycommittees  an unfavourable  time for approaching employers.   The  Norwich  JuvenileAdvisory Committee are, however, using the occasion to explain to employers their efforts to induce  children  to  remain at school until employment  has been found for  them, andthe importance of employers backing up their efforts  in this direction by engaging their employees only through the committee, so that the children who remain at school maynot feel that they are losing opportunities for getting work.  A number of  local  firms have agreed to support the committee, and at a recent meeting of the Boot and ShoeManufacturers&apos; Association  a resolution was passed recommending all manufacturers to engage their juvenile  labour through the committee.   The committee are also preparedto circulate lists of applicants desiring employment in a particular trade to any employers who desire to have them.    Northampton. Acting on  a suggestion of the Juvenile Advisory  Committee, theDirector of Education has sent a letter to the parents of all children who were due to leaveschool  at Christmas, pointing out the lack of opportunities for employment, and urgingthem to keep their children at school until suitable  employment  can  be found.   Thedirector points out that the education committee will be prepared to release these children at any time when  employment is secured.  Similar action is being taken by a numberof other committees.    Bedford.-The Juvenile Advisory Committee have tried the experiment  of invitingall the boys who were applying for vacancies in engineering to a special rota committee,where representatives  of two of the engineering firms in the district attended to interviewthem and give them advice.  The experiment was found to fulfil a very useful  purpose,and the committee intend to hold a similar meeting shortly to advise girls.1    Ireland-k report from the Chief Employment Officer in Ireland shows the extreme difficulty of carrying  on the work of the Juvenile  Advisory Committees in the presentdisturbed  state of the country.  In Cork it has not been possible to hold any meetings    (B 16896T)                                                            P 3

During the week ending the 14th January the Appointments  Departmentplaced 375 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates knownto have been placed to 48,445.  Of  these, 6,557 have been placed through the agency ofthe departments Interviewing Boards.  Applications were registered from 792 ex-Servicemen and 26 civilians.  The  number of candidates available for  appointments on the14th January was 10,585 ex-Service men and  1,404 civilians.  At the same date  1,102&quot; live &quot; vacancies were at  the disposal of the department,  500 having  been registeredduring the week.                   BUSINESS  AND  PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.    Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 14th january the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from19 officers and men of similar educational qualifications, of which 13 were for trainingof the type  provided  by the department.  Deducting cancellations and withdrawals,28,216 applications for training of this latter type have  been received in all, and 49,770for training of the type provided by other Government departments.  The InterviewingBoards have dealt with  27,670  applications, of which 23,196 have been recommended.The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have  received 22,099applications and sanctioned grants in 18,276 cases.    Business Training Scheme.-During the week ending the 14th January the Appoint-ments  Department received  181 applications for  training under  this scheme,  bringing the total number of applications to 1,803, of which 340 have since been cancelled.  Grantshave been sanctioned in 295  cases.   At the  same date, 323 training vacancies were atthe disposal  of the department, 64  having been registered during the week.    Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant-The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with a total  of 998  cases, in 463 of which the training sanctioned is pro-vided by the Appointments  Department,  and in  the remainder  by other  Governmentdepartments.  Candidates accepted  by  the Ministry of Labour have completed trainingin 258 cases, and abandoned training in 45 ; 141 are still in training, and 19  are awaitingtraining.                        TRAINING  DEPARTMENT.                           INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.    Statistics-On the 18th January, 25,069 men were in  training, as against 25,010 onthe 11th January and 25,065 on the 21st December.  The number of men placed intraining during the week was 469.   There were 16,145 men awaiting training, the corre-sponding totals for the 11th  January and the 21st December being 16,293 and 16,186,respectively.  The  number of men whose training had been completed since the 1stAugust, 1919, was 24,144, the totals for the 11th January and the 21st December  being23,734 and 22,732, respectively.since May, 1920.  In Belfast, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford, meetings have been held with fair regularity, but it is not surprising to find that it is difficult to sustain the interestof the members.  The  Waterford Committee have been able to keep up their after-carework, and continue to  show an interest in the question of the training of apprentices.

     The majority of the divisions have during the week been able to effect reductions intheir waiting lists, rangingrfrom 78 in Yorkshire to three in the South Midlands.  On theother hand, the Middlesex, Irish and London lists show increases of 92,47 and 40, respectively.     During December there has again been a substantial increase in the number of menin training in instructional factories, and by the end of the year 36 per cent, of the totalwere receiving  their instructions under  factory  conditions.   With  comparatively  few exceptions, a reduction in the number of men in training in technical schools and similarinstitutions is shown,  and the tendency to concentrate institutional training  as far aspossible in the Government  Instructional Factories is being  maintained.  There  has again been a  slight falling-off in the number of men training  in employers&apos; workshops,the  industrial situation having the effect of reducing the number of workshop  openings.During the last quarter of the year the number of men in training in Government Instruc-tional Factories rose from 6,696 to 9,084, an increase of nearly 36 per cent.     Exhibitions. Satisfactory progress, is reported in connection with the arrangementsfor the display of the work of men  in training  at the Daily Mail Efficiency Exhibitionwhich is to be opened at Olympia next month.  Each of the factories in the London area in which training in carpentry  and cognate trades  is being given has one or more of thestands in process of construction.  Sign writers in  training are engaged upon the  variousposters and signs which will  be required.   The date of the  Plymouth Exhibition, whichwill  be held at the Guildhall,  has now been fixed for the 9th and 10th February.     Government Instructional Factories. During December two new factories VanbrughHall, Blackheath, and  Sedgwick Street, Preston have come  on to the  active list.   Asregards numbers in training, Cricklewood with 502 men heads the list of factories, closelyfollowed by Loughborough with 498 men.  The numbers exceed 400 at Sarisbury Court,City Hall, Manchester,  and Cardiff, with 489, 473 and 442 men in training,  respectively.The  most notable increase in numbers of men in training during the last quarter of theyear is  shown by the Camden Town Factory, with an increase of 249.     The London and Middlesex Divisions still occupy the first and second places as regardsnumbers of men in training under factory conditions, with 1,383 and 1,070,  respectively,the  Scotland and the East Midlands  Divisions being third and fourth, with 938 and 922.     The most important increases in the numbers of men training in factory conditionsduring the quarter are shown by London  with a rise of 417,  Middlesex with 333, EastMidlands with 265, and Yorkshire  with 229.   The Yorkshire figures, having regard tothe very serious difficulties which have been experienced in securing accommodation, are particularly satisfactory.     The opening of the Belfast Factory was postponed until the 19th January,  on which date it  was expected that 108 men would start training in bootmaking, tailoring, hair-dressing and vehicle building.     The plumbing class at the Walker Factory was visited on the 15th January by 30members  of the North Shields branch of  the United Operative Plumbers&apos; Association,who  inspected samples  of the work carried out.   They were very favourably impressed,and  announced their intention  of taking the earliest opportunity of advertising, in theirshops, the progress made by the men in training at the Government Instructional Factories.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.     Statistics. Up  to  the 19th January agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 45,361 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved.  Grants had been sanc-tioned in respect of 43,387 apprentices, employed by 17,295 employers.  The total numberof agreements lapsed on expiration of the  appropriate period  of  training, or by  mutual agreement between the parties, is now 16,941.     Period of Renewed Training. In the South-Western area several cases are reported inwhich apprentices have found their time under the scheme inadequate to qualify themfully for journeymen&apos;s work.  Now that their period of training is completed, they are in danger of being discharged.  In a  similar case in London, two apprentices of Messrs.Mayer &amp;  Phelps, surgical instrument makers, were thrown back  considerably  by their service in the army, which impaired their delicacy  of touch, and their period of renewedtraining proved insufficient.   The firm felt unable  to pay them full journeymen&apos;s rates,except after an  extended term of training.  Similar requests for extension, though notnumerous, have  been  put forward previously.  The conditions of the scheme, however,do not permit the department to grant any such extension.
    Ncm-Observance of Conditions.-At Barry the refusal of the Barry Dock Steam PilotCutter Co. to carry out their agreements was reported, early:, in October, to have been going on  for some time.  No settlement has yet  been reached.   The difficulty is duechiefly to the question of wages and to the  company&apos;s objection to reducing the periodof training in accordance with the scheme.   It is hoped, however,  that a full settlementwill be reached  at the February meeting of the Barry Pilotage Board.    Termination of Agreements. At Margate  an  apprentice  with  Messrs.  Beeching,Moses &amp; Co. was charged at the police court with stealing from the  firm and pilferingfrom the other workmen&apos;s boxes.  He was not convicted, but the firm have summarilydismissed  him.  He has asked  the help of the department, and  in his turn  complainsthat he has been underpaid by the firm for the last three months.  The case is being carefully watched.    Unemployment. In view of the Government proposals for  the  working of short timein order to  reduce discharges, a number of important firms in the Northern area are apparently placing apprentices under the scheme on  half-time instead of suspendingthem.  The firms in question are also stated to intend to apply for extensions of the periods of training, corresponding to the amount of time so lost by the apprentices.    Institutional Training. Applications for  institutional training are still being received in the Yorkshire and East  Midlands area, and are reported to  be due  in all cases to the suspension of the apprentices owing to slackness of trade.   At Paisley  the classes for theapprentice engineers, who are being suspended in alternate weeks, have now been started,the first with 19 students on the 10th January and the second with 18 on the 17th January.Treasury sanction has  been  refused for the proposed short course of full-time training atthe Government Industrial  Training Section at the  Royal Technical  College, Glasgow,for those whose remaining period under the  scheme is too short for them to benefit bytraining in alternate weeks.   At Aberdeen a very large firm of engineers and shipbuildersare being  compelled to suspend apprentices, and have approached local headquarters forthe provision of a course for them at the Robert Gordon Technical Institute.  negotiations are proceeding.    During the  course for apprentice plumbers at the Royal Technical College, Salford,lectures on sanitary science were arranged by  the college authorities at the special requestof some of the apprentices.   Seven of the  apprentices have applied for an extension oftheir period at the college.General Training.    Apprenticeship:  Building. At Middlesbrough, Darlington and Stockton  both em-ployers  and  operatives have agreed to joint  conferences, which are now being arranged.The employers at South Shields have also considered the scheme, and rivalry with NorthShields, whose committee is already established, appears to be expediting matters in this district.  A joint conference at Manchester has decided to adopt the scheme and establish a local  apprenticeship committee.  Progress is also  reported from Ashton-under-Lyne,Oldham and St. Helens. At Lincoln representatives of employers, workpeople and thelocal education  authority all favour  a joint  conference, which is  being arranged. Therepresentative of the education authority is  specially favourable to the provision of thescheme  for technical training, which he  regards  as  likely to satisfy a real need.  AtLeicester,  however, the employers consider that the  general attitude  of the workpeoplerenders  it undesirable  to hold a joint conference  immediately;  but little doubt is feltthat it will  eventually be arranged.    The Midland District Council of the National Federation of Building Trades Operativeshave circularised all their branches that they will be in  order  in  co-operating with &quot;theemployers in establishing local apprenticeship  committees.   At Birmingham a full delegate conference for the district, after considering the report of their local committee,  appointedone delegate  from each branch  of the industry to make preliminary examination of thescheme.  At Worcester delay is being caused by a wages dispute, as, until  it is adjusted,neither  side will consider the scheme.    Apprenticeships:  Farriery. The absence of facilities for  technical  training in this industry has been much commented  on, but the lack of boys  to attend the classes is a source of  difficulty.   At Halesowen and Swansea attempts to  start a class have failed.for this reason;  and  at York a flourishing  class  has had to  be  abandoned during thepresent session.  At Sunderland the experiment was tried some  years ago  of sending
an instructor to give technical training in the forges, but it failed to arouse interest andwas abandoned.     Apprenticeship:  Furniture. In Wales  much  of the work does  not seem to involvea high degree of skill.  The amount of large-scale production is not apparently very great,and one large Cardiff firm have abandoned it owing to the shortage of  skilled labour causedby the war.  Though there is a surplus of boys  at present by reason of trade depression,there is normally a shortage.   This seems attributable to the attractions of the tinplateindustry and of highly-paid  unskilled work, while apprentices&apos; wages seem  rather  low.Trade union limitation  of apprentices  is sometimes blamed,  but  a  proportion of oneapprentice to three journeymen in each branch does not seem unduly restrictive.  Employersgenerally  are willing to discuss the subject of training, and agree that improvements are needed, but do not appear to favour provision of technical training during working hours.     Apprenticeship:  Printing. Employers and operatives  appear  to realise fully theneed for dealing with the question of training.  Information upon the  supply of apprenticesvaries.  In the Welsh colliery districts  they are very scarce, and even those who  enter the industry do not  complete their indentures.  In some towns in the West Midlandsthe supply seems adequate, but there is a severe shortage at Coventry, which would beincreased  by a revival in the motor trade,  and a Birmingham firm report that  recruitsare inadequate in number and quality.  There is a tendency to blame the local educationauthorities and head teachers for this  state of affairs.   A satisfactory feature of  somereports is the  evidence  that there is  comparatively little  &quot; blind-alley &quot;  work in theindustry.  In some  districts employers are not favourable  to technical training duringworking hours.  At Cardiff, for instance, all attendance is in the evening and no time offis allowed.  Employers at Batli take the same attitude, but in this  district the availablefacilities are reported to be very poor.   At Preston they are quite inadequate.     General Training and Conditions:  Engineering (Birmingham).--The training and treatment of boys, whether apprentices or labourers, reaches a high standard in the works of the General Electric Co., Ltd.  In the higher  branches  there is definite apprenticeship,which is treated most seriously, and trouble is taken to give a wide  range  of experience.Great interest is also taken by the foremen in boys employed upon semi-skilled machineor bench work, and, in particular, it is recognised that to give experience on a numberof machines will lead to greater ultimate efficiency.    Technical Training (Miscellaneous). In Wales the interest of employers engaged inthe manufacture of railway vehicles is  reported to have  been so  much stimulated thatthey are arranging for technical classes in railway rolling stock construction at the CardiffTechnical College.   The Wagon Repairers&apos; Association  have promised to  contribute towards the cost, and at a recent meeting some 20 apprentices promised to enrol.    At Birmingham a special course  is being arranged for shop-fitters and shop-fitters&apos;draughtsmen.   There have in recent years been  improvements in the design, appearanceand details of shop-fittings, due often to the work of these men, and the course aims atcarrying the improvement further.
