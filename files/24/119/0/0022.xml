At its Mooting of Do en mb or 2, 1920, tho Assembly adopted the following Resolution:-     &quot;(a) That the amendments to tho Covenant proposed          by the Denefc, Norwegian and Swedish Govern-          mentOj shell at this moment, not bo taken          into consideration by the assembly, and      (b) Thftt tho Council bo invited to appoint a          Committee to study tho said proposals of          amandmontc, together with any which may be          submitted by a Member of the League within          a period to be fired by the Council.1     This Committee shall report to the Council, which shallplace the conclusions before the Assembly at its next Session.&quot;     The Council at its Meeting of December 17th, 1920, fixedMarch 31st 1981 as tho dato.of the termination of the periodreferred to in (b) of the Resolution.

 (Annexes 1, 2 and 3) which were then before the Assembly, and which the Assembly, ? the first part of the same Resolution, decided not to take into consideration at that moment. These proposals are to some extent identical. The Danish Government proposed that Articles III, IV, XIII and XVI of the Covenant should be amended. The Norwegian Government proposed the amendment of Articles III, IV, XII, XIII and XVI, and also proposed the addition of an Annex to the Covenant, dealing with Commissions of Arbitration and Conciliation, the Annex consisting of thirty-seven Articles, divided into four chapters. The Swedish Government proposed that Articles III, IV, XIII and XVI should be amended, and subsequently it proposed amendments to the Norwegian Government&apos;s proposals regarding Articles XII and XV, and to the proposed Annex to the Covenant. In the draft submitted by the Swedish Government, this Annex consists of twenty-four articles.

At the meeting of the Assembly of December 2nd, 1920, the head of the Portuguese Delegation referred to certain amendments to Articles IV, XII, XIII and XV of the Covenant, which his delegation desires to have submitted for consideration by the Committee on Amendments to the Covenant. These proposed amendments, in definitive form, were later formally presented by the Portuguese Delegation (Annex 4).

The Colombian Delegation took the same action with reference to a proposed amendment to Article V of the Covenant (Annex 5).

On December 4th 1920, the Argentine Delegation submitted a written proposal that all sovereign States should be admitted to the League in such a manner that if they did not become members of the League, it would be the result of a voluntary decision on their part. The acceptance of this proposal would have necessitated an amendment to

i     -    139Article I of the Covenant, and, at its Meeting of December6th, 1920, the Assembly decided to refer the proposalto the Committee on Amendments (Annex 6).i  ,  in an address to the Assembly on November 17th 1920, and in his letterof December 4th 1920, to the President of the&apos;Assembly,the head of the Argentine Delegation referred, in general terms to certain other proposed amendments to the Covenant.The Secretary-General has suggested to the argentine government that if it desires formally to submit these other proposals, or any of them to the consideration ofthe Committee on Amendments, it should formulate them inpriciso terms ana submit them not later than March 31st1921c   Because of the shortness of timo, it die. notsoom practicable to delay the despatch of the communication to the Argentine Government until the Council met,     The Canadian Delegation, on December 4th,  presented to the Assembly a proposal for the deletion of Article 1of tho Covenant (Annex 7),,&quot;    The Assembly on December  6threferred this proposal to the Committee on Amendments.     On December 10th, the Assembly adopted the Reportof Sub-Committee B* of the Sixth Committee, paragraph 5of which provides that any proposal *which the InternationalBlockade Commission may make, and which is of a natureto require amendment of the Covenant, shall be  referred                                         xto the Committee on Amendments (Annex 8).     The Assembly by a Resolution (Annex 9)&quot;adopted onDecember 11th, referred to the Committee on amendments thevarious proposals, regarding the method, of selection ofthe non-permanent Liombers of the Council, th-t had beenconsidered by the Pirst Committee, and it directed that  are;ort on them should be submitted to the next Assembly,       x  Mot reproduced.
     In a Recommendation (Annex 13) &quot;adopted on December17th, tho Assembly expressed the wish that the Committee on amendments should considor whether, and in what manner, itwould be possible to attach to .the League of II lions soveroi&amp;States \.hich, by reason of their small size, oould not boadmitted as ordinary LI embers.     The ASoombly, in a Resolution (Annex 11) adopted onDecember 17th requested tho Committee on Amonumonts tooonsidor what steps should be taken with referenoo to states which had not paid their contributions to the Leac.ue \,ithina spooifiod period.     These proposed amendments (some of which suggest theamendment cf a number of Articles of the Covenant), and related matters, which have been referred to the Committeeon Amendments, alroady number elovon0   A class ifioat ion ofthese proposals, according to the nsture of their subject-matter, has been made and is annexed (Annex 12). .     It id suggested that the Council, should now proceedto constitute the Committee on Amendments for the study ofthe matters referred to it by the Assembly, ef any. mattersinvolving an, amendment of the Covenant which the committee may on Its. own Initiative decide to examine, and of suchmatters of this :charaoter as the Cou..oil may from time totime refer to.it..   : - Among matters which might under certain circumstances be brought within this last class are the question of thointerpretation -or amendment of Article XVIII: o .* the Covenant,(see Council Document Uo. 12$), the question of the allo6a-tion of the expenses of the leaguo, and the .question of thorequirement of&apos;unanimity for decisions of the Council,      H  Hot reproduced.
                                                  i    I    141particularly for those decisions which relate to questions concerning Mandates, or to tho-application.of tho EoonomiaWeapon of the League-.    as regards the question oi&apos; theunanimity of the Council for questions concerning Mandates,the following paragraph from Counoil Document 111, ehich was approved by the Council on Doeember 17th 1920, may be quotad:-     &quot;Our occlusion is, however, that the principle of      unanimity for decisions of tin Counoil, ps laid      down in Article 5 of the Covenant,/should net be      overridden by ;-ny decision of the Council itself.     - Future Couicils could not bo compelled tc accept      such a stipulation,  and in consequence it would      create a possibility of confusion and uncertainty.      It is preferable te leave this matter open u-til      the whole queotioa of majority and unanimity      deciovo;rJ has been reconsidered by the Commission      on Amendments to the Covenant.&quot;                   III.

                                        ,it possible to estimate this at present but/is sUcCostedthat the members mi^ht in addition to travelling expensesreceive an indemnity of  5 a day.     A Draft Resolution giving effect to these suggestionsis submitted for tho consideration of the Members of theCouncil,     Owing to  pressure of time,  the present Annexes,though complete, are,presented in a draft slssje *They are being  printed and will  as soon as possiblebe circulated  as a collective document.2 Whitehall Gardens, o,&quot;.
