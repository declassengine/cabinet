GTORAI, staff OF THE COUNTRY.   StatiBti\CB of jyi;.&apos;:rages.        I regret to state that the past week has been one of the   worst on record both as regards the number of eerious outrages   committed and the number of casualties inflicted upon Crown forces.   A sudden renewal of activity on the part of the extremist section   of the Republicans was not unexpected as a sequel to the tenta-   tive efforts to promote peace discussions reoen,tly made by   certain of the more moderate leaders of Sinn Fein, and the pres-   ent outbreak bears all the marks of long and oareful preparation.   $To less than forty-two separate attacks on parties or individual   members of the police and Military were reported, but apart   from their propaganda Talue for political purposes,  as tending   to discredit the progress which i^Seing made in the  restoration   of law and order;,  the organisers of these crimes have had   little cause for congratulation in the results obtained.  Of   the 11 fatal casualties sustained by the police, 5 were oases   Of cold blooded and cowardly agsasainations, and the remainder   were all inflicted on the same occasion - an ambush of a                                &quot;* 1 -
small patrol hecr Glenifco d, sixidlebrid^ ,  0 . 31 art onthe 2rth instant, in vhich a District inspector,  a sergeantand four ooristaibles v/erc cilice, an:: a sergeant ana aconot.able w,uhded.  In all the. other oase r. the police defendedthemselves successfully and inflicted heavier losses on their opponents than they theme el via sustained.     A feature of these attatko was the number of raidsupon police Barracks, 2 vacated Barracks (Ballyvoumsy,Oo, Cork and Kostrevor, Co * Do&apos;n) were destroyed,  but eachcne of the 13 attempts on occupied barracks was completelyfrustrated, no appreciable damage bein^ done to the barrackin any case.     Apart from  the sixmilebridge ambush,  above mentioned,the most important engagement durin-; the week was an attackon an Auxiliary patrol *cnsistin;s of eleven men which occurred near KHroe, (Tuam District, no.  Gal way) on the1,8th instant.   he ambushers who numbered about thirty meny/ere driven off  after a sharp encounter and several of them were seen to fall.  The Auxiliaries loot six of their numberwounded*     The only military casualties for thf  week - ere 4oases of wounding sustained in an ambush at Coolaun, Temple-more District, Go. Tipperary on the 19th instant.     Raids on mails numbered 33, a eli;$ht increase on those of the previous week.     131 arrests for outrages and political offences were affected during  the week.Trials of Civilians by court partial.     Seventy-two trials  of civilians by court partial tookplace during the  eek and resulted in sixty convictions *and twelve aoquittals.  Sentences of penal servitudewere imposed in  eighteen cases, including - one life sentence                       * fit -
for an atto.ir.j5t to murder a police constable.   the sentences in the other ca-us ranged from&apos;three  yer.rs toten years,  imprisonment -with h?rd labour,  for periods fromfour -rnthg to two years was imposed in twenty-seven cases,and imprisonment without hard labour in three oases.Imprisonment with the option of a fine was  imposed  in fourcases, and in two oases the accused was bound over in hisown recognizances to be of good behaviour.   In theremaining six oases the sentences were remitted by  theconfirming officer.  Of the total number of cases triedfifteen were oases of ordinary crime and the remainingforty-seven were offences connected with the Sinn Feinrevolutionary movement.  Three of the prisoners acquittedwt re member?, of the Auxiliary division of the  royal irish constabulary who Vert charged with being in possessionof stolon goocs.Internment Orders.     Thirty-four orders for internment were made duringthe week.  The total number of persons interned is  now1463.state of the Police Forces.     The week1 a recruiting figures for the  Royal Irish Con-stabularyafre.  again highly satisfactory.  Including the auxiliary Division the net increase in stren th for the  week is 3o4.  Resignations from the Regular Force are remarkablylow and I am glad to observe are nearly made good by recruitsfrom.  Ireland itself.  It would be a matter for regiet and likely to be productive of future difficulties if,  byreason of the present need for rapid expansion, the force were to fail to preserve its national character. Theusual particulars of wastage and recruitment are as follows:-
