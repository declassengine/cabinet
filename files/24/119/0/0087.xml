No. 38 0., 10th February11 Nawab and I had private meeting this afternoon with Tarsi and his assistant,Abdur Rahman, at the Foreign Office. After genera), conversation, in which Tarsiemphasised need of Afghanistan for British friendship to support her against Russianintrigue, I produced my draft amendments, explaining that I have no authority frommy Government for them, and that they were put forward privately as suggestion forcompromise. I said that this was furthest in the direction of compromise to which Ipersonally considered it possible to go, and that I had considerable doubts whether myGovernment would approve of my going so far. Tarsi repeated the usual argumentsabout the necessity of giving independence to tribes which I refuse to discuss again.He then tried in vain to get me to express my opinion about other clauses of Afghandraft. He hinted about Torkham, and I hinted the possibilities in this connection.Tarsi finally said he did not think my draft amendments would meet Afghan views,though something might be made of them. He would place them immediately beforethe Amir, and later inform me whether he wishes another private meeting.&quot;   -)\
