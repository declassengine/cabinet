Report by the Cpnmilttee.           The  Committee desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet      to  the slow  progress of the arterial Aoad  schemes for  the      relief of unemployment in Greater London.   Some 774 man      only  ere  employed as against some 11//OO the number whom it &apos;      was e:pected to employ in London, and 14,000 the number now      actually  employed in the  Provinces.           The  facts are  set out in  the attached  memorandum      submittod by  the  Ministry of Transport.           The  Committee  have considered in what  way  it is possible      to meet the  situation  without  giving a definite  cause  for      grievance  to  those  County Councils and other local  Authorities      who have  with public spirit accepted financial responsibilities      for the schemes in  progress.                       are           The  Committee/moreover Of  opinion that any  further      fina;icHl  assistance must be limited to  such exceptional      conditions as will  not croote precedents that cen be quoted      by Local  Authorities generally  In support of claims for      additional grants from tho Exchequer for the reliof of      unemployment  in their  areas
The Committee recommend       that the scope of reference to the Unemployment       Grants Committee (lord Tit.  David1s Committee),       be enlarged so as to authorise them in their       discretion to make a grant of the  whole or part       of tho 50$ contribution,  which would normally       be payable by e Local authority,  in respect of       any arterial road scheme&apos;in Greater London, such       schema to be submitted by the Ministry of  Labour       end Ministry of Transport jointly  -       Subject elweys to the Unemployment Grants       Committee being satisfied in respect of any       particular scheme submittod to them that tho       following oonditions prevail       (1) That the loot! authority has refused to co-           opera to either on the ground  that tho  scheme           will only assist tho  unemployed in tho metro-           polls and not those in  its area - or that           it has elree&amp;y incurred heavy  obligations           in respect of arterial  roads,  anil       (2) That there is serious unemployment either in           the district in whioh tho proposed arterial           road will be made or  in a district near           enough to supply  the  labour required    (Sd.)  P. WICKS,Secretary  to the Committee.not;-  The Chairman of the Committee before leaving for         ootland directed that a Report on th,  abov;  lines        should be  submitted to th;  Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens, 3.W.1,   4th February, 19El.
              Lfemorandum i rom the ijdniatry of transport,     It will be recalled&apos; that the Cabinet originally authorised the errenc. iture of  5,200,000 upon work ot this character, thefund being raised as follows, via:- from the ho-d ^Und   4,000,000and fiora the treasury  1,800.000.   subsequently authority wasgiven for money to be advanced by was- of loan to Local  Authoritiesto enable them to finance their share of the oost of the workto the like sum, via;  5,200,000.  The total amount estimated tobe expended was, therefore, 210,40J,000*  This sum was  allocatedequally between irovinoial and metropolitan schemes*it^JLQ.. the Provinces;     The soheme is, on the whole, being satisfactorily  adminis-tered and there is no reason to doubt that t,,e programme willbe substantially fulfilled.As to the Metropolis:-     The scheme has not up to now been successful and the latest estimate is that only some 774 men axe at work against  K-,000in the Provinces and against an estimated number whioh  shouldhave been at work in London of some 11,700.   The programme for the iletropolis comprised about SO miles of new roads and about 40 miles of ro ,.d widening, and it v.as estimated thatthey Vvould when in full operation find employment for 23,400 nien.The schemes numbered 19 and the co-op;..ration oi the CountyCouncils for London, iii&amp;dleaex, Lssex, Kent, Herts and  surreywas invited.  Of these Councils, the following have not seentheir way to help, viz., Kent, Herts and surrey.     The London County Council set up a sub-Committee to investigate the schemes in detail and they have approved andarranged to find 50^ of the cost of 5 ox these at an aggregatecost to their ratepayers of about  200,000.                                                  The
\     The Middlesex County Council have agreed to contribute to\ ards  5 tsohemes at an aggregate cost to their ratepayers of 400,000.     The Essex County Council have agreed to contribute to two schemes at an aggregate cost to their rate payers of about 30,000*     The other Councils give various reasons ior declining toas.. 1st, among them such roasons boing:     (1)  Their commitments in connection with road schemes in          other parts of their Counties;     (2)  That tho schemes would not be of assistance to          unemployed in tneir counties, but are required for          the unemployed resident in the metropolis:     (3)  Their heavy iinaneial obligations,    /The result is that eight schemes have been approved and arein progress out of the total of nineteen above-mentioned.  Thework is in tie hands of the Local Authorities and in some oasesconsiderable apathy and lack of initiative is being shown bythese  Authorities, which accounts largely for the very small number of men employed^ .   .  *     The schemes which have not been adopted are favoured bytho Ministry of Labour as being urgently necessary for therelief of unemployment in populous metropolitan districts,Including the  dock area.,  but unless some further financialassistance ban be provided, there is little-or no prospect oftheir  being put in hand.
