Referred to &apos;Committee of Home Affairs * &apos; &apos;n&quot;DCrOCUilLTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT.X A CABINET H. 27.K   CP,   2 59/   LHSLATION FOR THE COMING SESSIONMemorandum by the Minister of Health.i..   ii mini mmmi imiwi   iVo-i inn.................iiiiiiiin.,...................-.............hiThe Cabinet has already sanctioned in principle theintroduction of the Ministry of Health (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill so far as it is necessary to continue the housing subsidyto private builders during the present year as already promised,and the small Bill to transfer to County and County BoroughCouncils the power, which was taken from Insurance Committees bythe Act of ladt year, of continuing the provision for the sanatoriumtreatment of tuberculosis.    The grants available for distributionthrough Insurance Committees expire at the end of April, so that theBill must be law by that time.    The importance of this matter isemphasised by the most encouraging improvement obtained last yearin regard to Tuberculosis, which is the subject of a separateCabinet Minute.I urgo that a Cabinet Committee be appointed at once toconsider these two Bin Is and to report to the Cabinet as to thedesirability or ctherwj.se of retaining any of the proposals inthe first Bill beyond those relating to Housing.Water Charges Bill.A small Bill is also necessary to enable certain WaterCompanies to increase their charges as has had to be done inthe case of gas, tramway and other undertakings.    Owing tothoir present statutory limit of charges some of them are unableto meet the costs of carrying on, and a draft Bill has been agreedwith the V/ater undertakings, Munioipal and Company owned, and isnow being discussed with representatives of the Municipal andother/
578other Corporations.,Bill amending the. Borough Funds Act,It will, I think, also be necessary as the result ofthe recommendations of Sir Donald Maclean^ Select Committeeon Procedure Governing Bills, to amend the Borough Funds Actby a short Bill requiring that the notice of a private Billprior to the statutory meeting of the electors should includea statement of the estimated expenditure which the provisionsof the Bill would entail.Dentists Bill and Proprietary Medicines Bill,Apart from the above, although proposals will clearlybe pressed for by local authorities and others on varioustopics, I am not seeking for sanction for any Bills except thatI suggest that the Dentists Registration Bill, which waswidely askod for last Session, and tho Proprietary MedicinesBill should be re-introduced in tho House of Lords and onlyproceeded with in the event of substantial agreement upon them,C. ADDISON.February 1.6th 1921,life.....
