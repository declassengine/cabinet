Circulated by the Secretary of State  or India&quot;.SECRET.CP,  2 548THE   COMING  SESSION.    I  have  received from  the  Cabinet Secretariat,  in common  with  the heads of other Departments, a request  that i  should submit to the cabinet before 12 o&apos;clock on Tuesday, anything that I could suggest for incorporation in the .King&apos;s Speech.  Although  the  recommendation  I  am about, to makedoes not concern me departmentally,  I would ask the indulgence  of mycolleagues, and especially the Home Secretary and the President of the Hoardof Trade, in the  appeal  I would make to  the  Cabinet  to  find lime  in thecoming session for a lull for the better preservation of birds.    I think the Cabinet is  well aware of the existence of a Plumage bill which has been introduced time and. again by private Members, and once byMr. Asquitfrs Government in 1914.  It  is a  Bill which  has  always coni-manded universal approbation, almost  unopposed second readings, and over-whelming assent by both, Houses, except for the conduct of a small and interested band of opponents, speaking and acting on. behalf of a nefarioustrade.  Some of  these men are the spokesmen of  those whose lives are spent in a trade comparable in its  cruelty and ill-effects to the trade in opium orother  drugs, or   to  the white slave  trade.  Others  are merely acting as  aresult of  petitions carefully organised  and purporting  to come from peopleemployed in the   trade,  mainly women, who think that their livelihood willbe hurt by the passage of  the Bill.  I   do  not  think  these people and theirspokesmen realise the horrors of the trade  in which they are working or howeasy it is to find  substitutes  for decorating ladies&apos; bats, but efforts are beingmade  to explain  the whole situation to them.    Now,  it  is   derogatory  to the  dignity  of  Parliament for  a measureintrinsically so uncontroversial to be   defeated session after  session by thedilatory  tactics  and deplorable arguments of these people.  But now thatthere  are so many Standing  Committees, a Private Bill has, as a matter of fact, as constant  experiment  has shown, very little chance of passing.  men will not attend the Standing  Oommitte for a  Private Bill which&quot; is likely togo no further.   Unless the Government legislates there is very little chanceof the passage of the measure.    The  only argument  which tells,  and tells with  great force, I admit,against my proposal  for a Government measure is this : We are pledged upto the  hilt to introduce no unnecessary legislation.   We are anxious to riseearly  and  to avoid  an autumn  session,  and  any demand on  the time ofParliament  must be  carefully  scrutinised.  It is  my  firm  conviction that what  .1  am asking for amounts to  something  under two  days,  for  the opponents of  the Bill  are  in so  hopeless a minority that  if they knew  the     3313    100   2.21
Government was going to carry the  Bill, their dilatory tactics would  be abandoned,  lint I would  most earnestly plead  that this is a  necessary Bill,becoming more necessary every year, and that  the  results of delay areirreparable.   There are (1  understand)  If) species of birds of paradise, onceplentiful, slowly being driven into tho interior of the countries in which theylive, pursued by their  insatiable enemies, and gradually approximating to permanent extinction.  Tho meaningless adornment of ladies&apos; hats is spellingthe disappearance of the most harmless and bountiful creatures from the face of the earth, never to return.     Every year raids are  being made  upon these animals.   Every year thegreatest cruelty is being perpetrated.  No man can say how much  harm isbeing done to  any particular bird at any particular moment, but unless  weact quickly, it will at any  rate be too late to save some species.     There is one word that I would add.  There  is to my mind one argument against the Bill which  I have always found difficult to meet.  It is that theprevention of importation  of  bird plumage will  stimulate the destruction ofbird life in this country.   It is true that we have here laws lor the protectionof birds,  but they are admittedly imperfect.  I. presided over the Home OfficeCommittee which made its recommendations to the Home Secretary last year.-I believe that the only  laudable argument against the Plumage Pill could  beremoved  if  the Government  would  agree to introduce a Bill amending thelaw  for the protection of birds  here  and abroad, the Plumage  Bill plusemendations of our own Wild Birds&apos; Preservation Bill.  The latter part ofthe Bill would  be quite uncontroversial, for it  affects the interests of no onesave possibly some of the cruel and indefensible methods  used by certainbird catchers, and the inclusion of this  matter would make the held of appealof the Plumage Bill wider, do away with some  opposition and incur no newopposition.                                                              E. S. M.     5th February 1921,
