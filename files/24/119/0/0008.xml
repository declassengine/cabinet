                                                         dThis Document is the Property of His -Britannic  Majestv&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1921.SECRET.C.P.-2508.?&quot;r.CABINET.AMENDMENT  OF  THE  MARRIAGE LAWS.                     Memorandum  by the Lord&apos; Chancellor.     I  DESIRE to  lay  before  my colleagues reasons  why, in  my  opinion, it  isincumbent upon the  Government to take steps without  delay for  the  amendment ofour marriage laws, and to explain the course which I  think should be adopted.     Last session the  Matrimonial Causes  Bill  occupied the attention of the House ofLords on practically every free day between March, when it was introduced, and June,when it passed its third reading.     The course of  the debates made plain  that the opposition to  the  Bill dependedalmost  entirely upon ecclesiastical considerations,  and  nowhere  could  those opinionsfind better expression  than in  a   House with  twenty-four representatives of  theEpiscopal  Bench.   Notwithstanding  this, and the  further  fact that  there  was  noorganisation  in support of the measure, the  third reading was ultimately carried by amajority of 154 to 107,  the total numbers attending  being within  eleven  of thosevoting on the second reading of the Home Rule Bill.     Whatever may  be  said  about  the  constitution of  the House of  Lords, it isimpossible  to deny that  these  figures represent the strong conviction of men wellversed  in  knowledge of the  world&apos;s  affairs  and   able  to  express  an  independentjudgment,  which it  is  right to accept as a true reflex of public opinion.   I have been unable to find the record  of any measure that  has received such prolonged and  careful attention in the House of Lords which has been wholly disregarded by the House ofCommons.     The  Bill itself did  not go  one single line beyond  the  recommendation  of themajority of the Royal Commission who sat for three years under the presidency ofLord Gorell  to investigate the question, and examined in the course  of their laboursno fewer than  246  witnesses.   The  minority report consisted of three men only the archbishop of  York,  Sir Lewis Dibdin and Sir William Anson.   The labours of sucha commission cannot  be  disregarded if it is  desired as it  certainly should  be tomaintain the  reputation and authority of a Royal Commission called in to advise theHouses  of Parliament.     To quote one  sentence only from  the  report &quot; In  the interests of justice andmorality &quot; this measure  is overdue.  Further, it should be remembered that, exceptingon the question of extending the  grounds  of divorce, the Commission  was unanimous,and the extended grounds of divorce  are to be found only in section 4 of the Bill.     It  is useless to expect the House of Lords to consider the measure again  if it is introduced there for the first time. They would rightly resent the apparent indifferenceshown to  their former labours, and would argue with convincing force  that if  theGovernment  really  intended to adopt the Bill, were it once  more passed, they mightjust  as well introduce  it for themselves in the first instance.     There can, indeed,  be  no  material  difference  between the introduction of  themeasure anew in the House of Commons as in the ensuing session and  its introduction,after passage by the House of Lords, in the last session, had time permitted.     If this view be accepted there are  only two courses, open the one  is to treat thewhole measure  as a  private members matter and to grant  facilities for its introduction.This would undoubtedly  result in  nothing but a shelving  of the Bill.  No  private member could possibly undertake such a task with any hope of success.  It was not asa private but as a public  concern  that the Royal Commission made their recommenda-tion, and  tu  entrust  the  measure to  a private member would  be to  abnegate the truefunction of government.

                                        0                                        M     On the other  hand, the question of extended causes for divorce  undoubtedly cutsright across the ordinary lines of division of political opinion, biit reconciliation, of these difficulties can easily be effected if the Government, introduced the measure exactly asit passed  the House of Lords,  with a statement that  they propose to leave  to  theunlettered  judgment of the House the determination of the question of the extendedgrounds.     After carefully reflecting 1 have  been unable to discover any objections to be madeto this proposal.     In  urging that the Government should adopt this  course without delay, I  do notoverlook the anxious and difficult conditions under which Parliament will reassemble;but industrial matters cannot occupy the exclusive attention of the House, and  it may even  be that some small diversion of the public mind to other questions would  not  be without value.  Matters cannot be allowed to remain as they stand.   Every  candidatewill be harassed at the election by small groups of active noisy people who will attemptto secure pledges on the question as  a condition of support a most mischievous use of electoral power which  is  only too common.   Were the Bill  once law this  would allvanish ; yet the passage of the  measure would  not, I believe, affect a dozen votesadversely to the Government, and might even win for them renewed support.     I earnestly recommend these  considerations to my colleagues in the  hope that thepresent  opportunity for  remedying  long-standing abuses  will  not  be  permitted  topass by.  If my colleagues should share my view, I would urge that the subject  shouldreceive mention in the King&apos;s Speech and that the measure should  be  introduced in theHouse of Commons as soon as the Address has been voted.
