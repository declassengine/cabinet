A small quantity of free Australasian Meat has already arrived and been put on the market.   In future the return of sales of Australasian Mutton and &quot;tamb  will not  re&apos;- present the full total consumption.      The wood workers strike in British shipyards  in December has led to serious delays to shipping and the result  will become apparent in the very small quantity of tonnage available for loading free meat in Mew Zealand in February and  March.There will be a consequent shortage in arrivals in  April and  May*                                        CHARLES A. 9  MoCURIY .Ministry of Food,

(P 050)           From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,             J 283-                                    January .1921.                             (Received 30th, 10 a.m.)     Priority A.   -     loO S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following  telegram  lias  been received  fromDobbs, 2Sth January :-     &quot; Second part of sitting yesterday.   Nadir Khan present.   Your telegram of 27tkJanuary, 127 S., arrived, after its conclusion.  1. started  by saying that I would firstdiscuss Clause 8, because, if Afghans  maintained  their  demands regarding tribes, itwould be waste of time to discuss remainder of Treaty.   Wo must take very seriousexception to Clauses 7  and 10 also, but Clause 8 was most serious.   I then caused tobe read out      &quot; (I.) Passages in Annr&apos;s and TarsPs letters stating that  they accepted principlesof Mussoorio conversations.     &quot;(2)  All passages in  those conversations relating to  general and tribal questions.Heading took an hour, and Nadir and his brother  followed  closely.   1 then askedTarsi whether he considered difference  between Clause 8 and Mussoorie principlestrivial, and declared that I. was not authorised to depart from those principles.  Tarsireplied that by &apos; trivial&apos; he  had meant  &apos; trivial compared with importance  of friend-ship  between two  Governments,&apos;  and  that  lie  and  Nadir  wished to press  theirargument again.   I consented to listen  but declared  that I could  not hold out any hope of departure from principles, and  Tarsi  and  Nadir  then (? reiterated) argumentadvanced  at  private  conferences, dilating on  our  difficulties, necessity of  Afghanfriendship, &amp;c.  t  replied that Bolshevik menace described  by them only confirmedus in our determination to maintain  present  strategic frontier intact, and Nadir thensuggested as an alternative to Clause 8 that tribes  should be  declared independent ofboth Governments and forgiven  for  all past offences, but informed that in future, ifthey made incursions  into  British territory,  British would  attack  them,  and,  if  onAfghan territory, Afghans would attack, thus acknowledging Afghan influence.   on my refusing to consider this, Nadir  said Afghanistan would  be publicly disgraced if she  abandoned  tribesmen  who  had helped  her  during war.   As  arguments nowbecame heated and it was late, I suggested that Afghans  should take time to considermy statements from which I could not depart and should  inform me later whether theyhad any scheme to propose  likely, iii the light  of my statements, to he acceptable tous, as, failing such  scheme, further  meetings  would be useless.   From expressionsused by Afghans it is  clear that  Persian situation is already having very perniciouseffect.  Tarsi has asked that Nawab shall meet  him  privately to-morrow to explainposition regarding Shakar Khan1 Menggal of Nushki, and he may possibly intend to try to devise on that occasion some  acceptable  scheme.   But 1  have not  (? agreed).Afghans will probably ask for  another meeting next  week,  and,  it&apos;  th&apos;w  continueintractable, J. shall make statement on  lines authorised bv von with such additions as-circumstances mav dictate.&quot;
