The  drivers  and  firemen decided  at  Leeds on the  Oth  to  call  out  their  men on  the  15th  If an  enquiry  were not held into the  shooting  incident  at  Mallow, in which  two rail7/railwaymen were alleged to  have been  killed by  Auxiliary Polioe;  they also demand  representation at the  enquiry.  It i3 uncertain yet  whether the National Union of Railwaymen will  support them or whether all the drivers  will obey.      The  National Union and the engineers are  still  unable to  compose their differences  regarding  the  representation  of  the  railway shopmen,  who are tired of their  present  position.  Railwaymen generally are opposed  to  short time,  which they consider  an infringement of the  guaranteed week.      The  miners are  unsettled but not as yet bellicose.  They  favour control  and are  almost unanimously opposed to the percentage  system, preferring a flat  rate of wages.      There is no  improvement in unemployment,  although&amp;h  the cotton  Operatives in Lancashire are very optimistic.  The London  District  Council of Unemployed,  which represents  the unemployables  and  extremists, is  threatening a disturbance at the  Labour  Party  conference on February  23rd.      The  Red International of Trade  Unions  is  uniting the  rebel  elements  in various  industries;   details of a  secret meeting in  Manchester are  given.   Full time  organisers are  at work and  are  paid from funds whioh Murphy is said to  have brought back  with  him  from  Russia.!  I   As foreshadowed in the la3t  report, there is not muoh unity ,^nong the Communists; many of them are disappointed  at  not  receiving paid  positions.  The expenses  of  the Leeds conference,  ambpiting to over  1,000,  were defrayed  by  Friis, the Delegate  from Norway, who  came to Hull as  a stoker.                                                       The/
     The Irish Self-Determination League is circulating&apos; anumber of pernicious leaflets urging direct action to stop the &quot;war&quot; on Ireland,     The past week in Ireland has been marked by a largenumber of serious outrages.  There is no sign yet that therevolutionary gang is broken, though information concerningoutrages is now being given more readily.
UNEMPLOYMENT             &apos;  -      *          .....  , ..          There is little change in the unemployment situation&apos;  &quot;     but there are signs that tho Labour leaders are becoming     uneasy about the unemployables.   These arc arranging a     demonstration for February .23rd  to demand that the     Labour Party conference instruct the rank and file to     strike for work or maintenance at trade union rates for     the workless.  The London District committee of     unemployablos is active in this  connection and efforts     are being  made to organise marches of women with  the     object of  making tho work of the  police in breaking  up     disorderly gatherings more difficult.   It is said that     400 women  have been enrolled for operations on February     23rd.          In London the temper of tho  unemoloyables is     becoming uglier end it appears thr-t  some  at least carry     weapons.  There is a marked decline  in public  support     and then tho  time  comes  that the  collecting boxes yield     a  negligible  return,  it  seems  almost certain that the     marchers will turn to moro mischievous activities.   The     moment seems  opportune for a sharp distinction to be     drawn  between the  unemployed and  the unemVioyables in     order  that public  opinion  may  be  rightly  informed and the     victimisation of the  genuine workless  prevented.         Isolated collectors  are now posted at  various parts     of  the Metropolis  and even in  small  country towns!It &apos;     was  noticed in London this  week that boxes  were pasted     over with  the  &quot;Hands  off Russia&quot; leaflet giving details     of  the, alleged transactions between  Soviet  Russia and    V&amp;nderlip&apos;.-                               &apos; &apos;&apos;   &apos;&apos;  &apos;     ,  -       ,  The Battersea Uhemployment committee has  resigned &apos;     en bloc  and new officials have been  elected; this committee    decline  to pay  the 5fo  contribution to headquarters at the                                             International/

The Kensington unemployed have abandoned, jmaJrcfces-, -sending     out men Instead with collecting boxe^r-they are also     canvassing local shopkeepers for food which they distribute *     among themselves.          From the provinces it is reported that unemployment is     still increasing: details show very little variation,  but the     situation in some of the large industrial towns is very grave,,     l*rom Lancashire,  for instance,  my correspondent writes,     &quot;Thousands of ex-Service men, not only in Manchester,  but all   -  over the area are destitute and practically on the verge of     starvation.&quot;          My Lancashire correspondent reports that  great optimism     prevails among  the cotton operatives that a better time is  at     hand.   He  has talked with hundreds  of unemployed and asked    -them why they  do  not take the advice of &quot;the&apos;&quot;l)any Herald&quot;  -  and  go  to  the Guardians and  one and all  have said  they  would     rather  starve.  Re mentions  as  a  sign  of  the temper of the   !:people  that though many persons may be seen in trams and     omnibuses  reading  the T&apos;Baily Herald&quot;,  in  nearly all oases thJ     fold down  the title  as  if  they  were  ashamed of it.THE COMMUNISTS      The nominal unity which was  achieved  among  communistleaders at Leeds finds  little reflection among  the  rank and file:&apos;this fact may be  due,  in part,  to disappointment,, sindalmost every communist  is of opinion  that he or she would bethe ideal official.  The most frequent charge against  theleaders of the Communist Party is  that they are individualieeven Saklatvala confessed recently that &quot;the Labour world ,a rotten one.  It is all on  the make  and not for higher objej                                                 John/
      John Maclean contributes to the current issue of &quot;The Socialist&quot; &quot;An open letter to Lenin&quot; in which he^unmercifully castigates the &quot;heterogeneous mixture of anarchists, sentimentalists,  syndicalists with a sprinkling of Marxists&quot; at present leading the Communist Party.   A London communist orator remarkod with some truth during the week that  those members of the working men class who educate themselves frequently became disheartened and accept the capitalist system as inevitable;  eventually they secure good positions and become reactionary.      The  British  Poale Zion,  which is reported to have been represented at the Leeds  Conference,  has now joined the Third International.      On February  6th W. Paul  gave a lantern lecture on Bolshevik Russia at Coventry,  under  the  auspices  of tho &quot;Rands  off  Russia&quot; Committee.   It is evident  that whatever  work Paul may have done for  the Labour College when abroad,  he  has collected valuable oropaganda  matter for  the  Communist  Party.      ,t     The  Bull  Ring orators in  Birmingham have met with unexpected  and  most  unwelcome  opposition:  a  rag and bone merchant  named  Ingram  has  started a  &quot;Patriotic  Socialist Association&quot; and  is  tackling the  communists  in their own  arena. The letter  fear his  influence which  is considerable..among.the working classes.     It is  reported  that the Norwegian delegate, Friis, who attended  the Leeds conference was especially  commissioned by Moscow to enquire into the mentality  of M&amp;cLean and was informed  that he  is  insane: the information given will n rob ablylead to more animosity.     At a secret communist meeting in Manchester a delegatereported  that the Leeds confer.;noe had cost  over 21,000and that the expenses had been paid by Moscow. - Money had                                              ;,j         been/
     been brought over by  the Norwegian delegate, Priis, who came     as a stoker to Hull,          Arthur MacMonus, who spoke during  the week at Glasgow,     travelled to the meeting in a motor car and left it in the same     way to go to Coatbridge, accompanied by two women.  It will be     remembered that recently all his engagements had to be cancelled     owing to MacManus1 grief at the death of his wife.          The boycott of &quot;The Communist&quot; by Messrs. Smith and     Marshall, to which I referred in my last report, has seriously     perturbed the Communist Party, whioh took a.page and a half of     the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; on February 5th at advertisement rates,     using the space to reprint part of their own paper.  Labour     organ is r.t ions are asked to aass a resolution whioh &quot;emphatically     rvrotests against the conspired attempt of certain wholesale     newsagents to diotate to the workers what paper they will be     allowed to read.&quot;          A leader of the Coventry branch of the Communist Party     states that the circulation of &quot;The Communist&quot; has increased    .by 5,QOO copies weekly since January 1st, 1921, but there is no     confirmation of this.  This branch has decided to ask permission     to ol&amp;ce a copy in the Public Library: If permission be refused,     the paper is to be placed in the Library all  the seme.                           the H5D INTERNATIONAL OF TRAPS UNIONS              *&apos;  &apos; -  &apos;          A document of considerable importance discloses the fact                       ...&quot;     *                               *   *&apos; .     that on January 27th and 28th a meeting in connection with the     above International and the  Shop Stewards movement  was held in     Manchester.   Delegates were  present representing the  Hiners&apos;     Unofficial Reform Committees of Scotland&apos;,  Yorkshire,  Durham and     Northumberland  and South Wales,  Liverpool Dockers,  Glasgow     Dockers,  International Trade and Industrial Unions  (Red     International),  Soottish Workers&apos;  Committee,  National                                                    Administrative/
 Administrative Council  of Shop  Stewards  and  Workers&apos; Committees.  P. H.  Kealey was.elected  to the  Chair. &quot;      The  meeting  divided  into  its   respective  sections of industry  to  discuss relationship problems, and  the National Administrative Counoil  and  Scottish  Workers1  Committee met to arrange an all inclusive  National agreement.,  It was decided as a  basis of  future  organisation, to  be placed before the National  Conference,  that the country  be divided into four areas, I.e.  Scotland, North of  England,  South of England, and Wales, and the  National Administrative Council be composed of eight, two drawn  from each area^and  that until the National Conference   throo members be  elected on the National Administrative Council from the Scottish Workers1 Committee to act as a provisional  National Administrative Council.      Miner8  Report.   Watkins, South  Wales Miners, stated that  this was  the first time  in the history of the unofficial movement that  the representatives of the miners from the four  most important mining centres had met, and it should be recognised that as the constitution  of the South Walea.Miners was the most advanced in  the  country,  the other miners federations be brought up to  the same standard.  Control at the point of the  lodges should be the slogan.  They found in their discussion  that they had no control over their representatives.  It would be-necessary  w have a series of local conferences in  the mining districts and then a-national conference of all unofficial miners committees. It was agreed that the whole matter of organising these conferences be left to the five representatives present.That they form themselves into a committee1for the purpose and draw up a manifestc to the miners to be presented tothe conference later in the  proceedings.     Murphy,  in continuing the discussion, was of the opinion                                                  that/
- 6 - that this was a unique situation.  They have representatives from several mining districts and not much orogress would be made unless it was realised that there WAQ larger and more important bodies than the miners.    Consequently the manifes of the miners must contain the position in relation to other industries and he would like to supplement a connection to a rebel elements in other industries in such a way that it coul go before a national conference of all industrial elements.      Foam,  Glasgow Dockers, stated that in Glasgow they had been organising for some time.   The one weakness lay in the organisation of Liverpool,  and the two vital ports of the country were Glasgow and Liverpool.  Ke was pleased to see that the miners were on the right lines and with the co-operation of the dockers they constituted a great power. Their power  lies roundt tho  strength to act and not to finance. They are going to bring into being a Scottish Transport Workers1  Federation,  in order to oreate a machine to break da the  power of the few officials  such as Sexton who run the show in the  interest of themselves instead of the rank vand fij whom they are supposed to represent.                .      A report was given of  the  Syndicalist conference, in Berlin.   Comrade Tanner gave the report and stated that an appeal had been issued in Moscow to  the Syndicalist oiganisatl and  that was the reason for calling  the conference.   A commitl was  appointed consisting of three  to  draw up a scheme,   fa tli resolution that  was presented there was a good deal of - discussion and it  was  finally agreed  to supplement the  term &quot;Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot; with  &quot;Domination of  theWorking  Class&quot;.   It was decided  to  send delegates to^the  Red International  Conference  in  Moscow and  to  accept  the deliberations  as  binding.     On January  28th a  sub-committee&quot;consisting  of Murphy,                                      &apos;  &apos;&apos;            Tanner/
mm   mmTanner. Campbell and Kime was elected and the draft of theminers&apos;, manifesto accepted: 100*000 copies of this wereordered to be printed.     The position in regard to the Red International of TradeUnions is not uninteresting; as will be seen from the manchester meeting the movement is solidifying the rebelelements and other evidence goes to prove this fact.  It isalso clear that expenses are to be guaranteed to an extent whichwill greatly facilitate propaganda: speakers and literatureare to be supplied from headquarters.  On the other hand,the steadier union officials are up in arms and the followingletter illustrates their attitude:           &quot;When I beoame secretary of a trade union branch     I did not consider that a part of my duties would be the     receiving of suoh damnably nauseating oirculars as those     which are returned, herewith.  Neither my members nor     myself have any wish to help propagate your doctrines.&quot;There are indications that a serious squabble is brewing in trade union circles.     Prom Ireland a secrotary writes that he is &quot;in thoroughacoord&quot; with the circular:          &quot;Needless to say Irish Labour has lost all faith in     the Hendersons and the Thomases, the clynes, the Barnes     and the Sextons.  A bold independent policy such as that     outlined by the Red International is the one which will     ultimately bring salvation to the workers.  I should only     be too happy to bring your resolutions to the menders but     owing to tho rigours of Martial Law and the Curfew we find  .   it utterly impossible to bring any body of men together at     the present time.&quot;     When the circular and resolutions were brought forward atthe Vale of Leven and Renton branches of the amalgamated engineering Union,  my correspondent arranged that rejection be moved on the ground that the policy was &quot;another move to smashTrade Unionism&quot;.  This move appears to have been successful.     Local organisers are being appointed on full time pay andMurphy is reported  to have brought back a large guarantee fundfrom Russia.                                                    THE/
- 3 -COAL MINERS      Tho minors, as a whole, appear to be very unsettled, but their attitude at present is anxious rather than bellicose. The majority favour control because they realise,tha.t unrestricte nrivate ownership means that the industry will be run on a business basis - i.e. that unprofitable pits will be closed. On the other hand, the average miner is indifferent&apos;to the question of control qua control, as long as his. money comes in regularly.   As regards wages,  the general feeling&apos;appears to favour a flat rate as opposed  to the percentage system and the men say that the present degression has &quot;knooked the bottom&quot; out of the  last settlement.      Mr.  Frank Hodges has been in Durham during the week and mad&apos; a  speech of some importance  on February 6th.   Be said.that a solution...had to be arrived at  by .31st March,  and he believed it was ,.the.most grievous and. certainly the most complicated problem, the miners had ever  had to  deal with.   The  industry was in a  bad  way.   At no  period  in its  history has the  outlook been, so gloomy as at present.   &quot;I do not want to make you unhappy,; but facts must be faced.&quot;  Unless some&apos; effective substitute could  be  found for Government  control,  they would be  again at tfc mercy  of  the.coal owners  in  the separate-districts; back to the old-conciliation,boards;  with  wages  determined by the orice of j coal, - regardless, of the prof its of. the ,induatr.v.     On  the, question  of arriving&apos; at; an  agreement&apos;with the  coal-l owners, Mr.  Hodges  said that the  owners  had entirely, different I ideas  tothe^Miners&apos;-Federation.  It was possiole that March,  .1 31st would  arrive.without any&quot;&quot;agreement  having been  effected,,. I and that; t^e Miners1: ^Federation would have  to  ask the Government to accept, their  scheme&quot;&apos;as distinct from  the scheme, of t^eowneJ
      &quot;What  should  be.the  foundation of a scheme that shall take  the place  of  the existing form of control?&quot;  Mr, Hodges asked.  To  this remark there were cries of  &quot;Nationalisation&quot; and  &quot;Socialisation&quot;,  to whioh Hodges replied, &quot;My friends, this  afternoon we  will confine ourselves to  realities.&quot;      Continuing, he saidj          &quot;If we had  a Government in power which would      incorporate in a Bill the recommendations of the Sankey      Commission, we snould not have to negotiate at all with      the coal-owners  as to what the future of the industry      would  be.  But we will endeavour to dovise a scheme which      will provide  for the miners the greatest possible benefit      in the existing  circumstances of the moment - retaining      as much as possible Of the advantages already secured.&quot;      The first consideration would be that the industry must oontinue to be constituted as one great unit.  They wanted to be perfectly sure that the industry, as a whole, paid its way, and that  the wages as  a whole were maintained as high as possible. They  must see that the industry was so far unified as to maintain the cost of production nationally, the price nationally, and the wages of the workmen  at a decent level nationally.      The miners would  claim, further,  that the national selling price should not be the determining factor in regulating wages. Both  the workmen&apos;s wages and the owners&apos;  profits should be determined by the difference between the cost of production and the nrice of coal  in  the market^ the difference being the profit making capacity of the industry.   By that means,  if the cost of production was reduced, the workmen would benefit  as well as the owners.   That should constitute the foundation of a national scheme,  and for that  they would require a national pool of profits.  In this pool the good districts would pay a portion of their takings to enable the wages to be paid in the districts where, because of the geological conditions, the men produce inferior coal which sold at a lower price.                                               Dealing/
TOM DINGLEY    , On February 7th Tom Dingley made a speech in the BullRing, Birmingham, which has been submitted to the Director ofPublic Prosecutions for consideration:          &quot;Why don&apos;t you do something?  It makes ;ae feel as    &apos; if I had been chloroformed whenever I hear anyone spesXj     of the Birmingham unemployed.  B   it&apos;,  xou go about     looking through first one window and then another of     well-filled shops, but you do nothing.          (Someone in the crowd said: *What can we do, we     want some leaders?&apos;)     Dingley said: ,&quot;What can you do?  Don&apos;t ask me, ask     yourself.   Tf you are satisfied as you are, remain as     you are.  B - it&apos;.  It only shows what rotten stuff youf     are made of.  I don&apos;t tell you to smash vindows and as    - for leaders,- I am sure you have some very able oomradesj     of mine here who have been making speeches to you for   1  weeks.&quot;                            &apos;                                            &quot;LABOUR&apos;S/      Dealing, next with the,question of settling the new wage standards, Mr. Hodges again contemplated much difficulty &quot;Whatever be the point 4at which we finally agree,&quot; said Mr.  f Hodges,  &quot;it will not be that which the owners are now presenting.&quot;.                                                             I      In  conclusion Mr. Hodges remarked that some people were saying thrt the miners were  creducing too much,  and that if they produced less they would get a higher price; that if th&quot;miners adopted the ca&apos; canny we would improve the value of our labour.&quot;  &quot;There  -never  was a bigger fallacy than that&quot; he declared.  The pits were  idle largely because of the terms of the Spa Treaty, under which Germany was supplying million of tons  of coal to Prance and Italy, and because of the Government1s attitude towards Russia.      The Sngineraen and Stokers&apos; Association has  decided by 102,648  to 7,37.3 votes to amalgamate with the South Wales Miners&apos;  Federation.

Money invested  in  the scheme will        be deposited  in the London Co-operative  Society1s loan        account and on completion the building will be the freehold        of the Society, who will be responsible  for administration and        control.

They demand representation at    enouiry and guarantees for the safety of Irish members.    It  is doubtful whether the National Union of Railwaymen wf    support them or whether all drivers will come out.         The Irish-Self-Determination League is widely  distril    leaflets appealing to Labour for direct action  in sympathj    with  Ireland.   The leaflets do not bear an  imprimator.

JjlANP  -       Information  to the effect that activity of the Irish Republican Army was to be increased and that as many police as possible were to  be murdered in the month of February has, so far, proved correct; there have been numerous attacks on the Crown Forces with heavy loss of life and there is every sign that this increase of  activity will be maintained.      The report of the Labour Commission on the conditions in Ireland contains  copies of official and secret documents which were stolen in the post and on these stolon documents the members of this &quot;Commission&quot; *.ave based most foul and libellous charges against loyal servants of the Crown.  Trie publication of this resort is a most  serious menace to the lives of several members of tho Crown Forces.      The areas under Martial Law do not reflect any change for the better.  It is noticeable that practically all the attacks made on the Crovn Forces have been against the police who have sustained most of the casualties in the Martial law areas.  In County Longford two motor lorries with Auxiliary police were attacked.   The first car was blown up by a mine.  The attack resulted in the deaths of four of the Crown forces and the wounding of seven of them.  Longford is not ?et under Martial Law.      The Sinn Fein papers appeared as usual and contained nothing of importance, except the usual propaganda about the atrocities committed by the Forces of the Crown.  The lies which these papers circulate are no doubt responsible for much of the unrest in the country.   The absence of counter-propaganda has enabled the Sinn Feiners to have things all their own way.      The opinion that Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican Army are on their last legs and that  the present activity is in the -nature of a &quot;dying  kick&quot;  is  not so strongly held as it was.
