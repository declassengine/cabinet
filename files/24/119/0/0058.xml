                                GENERAL.     A further decline in industrial activity has taken place in the week ended the 4th February. Short-time is increasing, and apprehension is felt in several industries that the continued absence of orders will shortly mean a further extension of short- time working.   This relates  especially to  the cotton industry, where  anticipated           ......----------------........   -       i....................................     -                 1 demands have failed to  mature.  Some improvement is manifested  in the boot and shoe industry, and longer hours are being  worked, more particularly among firms engaged in a medium-class trade.   Improvement is also taking place in the lace industry,  and some additional orders have been  received by hosiery firms.   The position in the jute trade appears to be firmer, and the statement that no further reduction  in prices can  be made is expected to have a steadying  effect  upon  the market. In spite of the fall in prices, the position in the iron and steel trade remains abnormal.  Short-time  working is becoming more common  in the cutlery  and  gold and  silver trades.  The joiners&apos; strike in connection with the shipbuilding industry continues, and no improvement can be expected until this  dispute  is settled.  The position with regard to shiprepairing  has, however, somewhat improved  in South WaTeFand at Avonmouth.                        II. EMERGENCY WORK.    The Prime  Minister made  a statement in the  House  of  Commons on  the 19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. He outlined  schemes for employing  a large  number  of  fit  ex-Service men  in connection with  the  Housing Programme,  on which negotiations  with the trade unions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme for Arterial Roads in London and in the  provinces;  whilst at  the same time pressing forward with the Ministry of Transports  programme  of  road  classification  and maintenance grants.    A further statement was made by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December, indicating that the further proposals of the  Government included: a final endeavour to secure an agreement with the building trades for the admission of ex-Service men; a rapid extension of road construction schemes; the distribution by the Unemploy- ment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Viscount St. Davids, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting local authorities  on relief schemes other than house building  and road work;  and the amendment  of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit. It has since been agreed that the Unemployment  Grants Committee shall also deal with schemes in respect of road work other than those undertaken by theMinistry of Transport.
