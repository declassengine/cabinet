S, C,
570MEIIQRAKDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR.The Air Ministry wishes to associate itself withthe \?ar Office and Admiralty in pointing out thedifficulties and inevitable consequences that must arisefrom any attempt to carry out the measures which the Cabinet,at a meeting on the 28th January last, decided should beadopted in order to coerce Government contractors intojoining the Kingfs National Roll.       It is considered:-(1)    That the measures proposed, in that they are tobe introduced into the existing system cfconfidential and competitive tendering, cannotbut be regarded as unfair to firms who, not beingon the King&apos;s Roll, tender lowest.(2)    The measures proposed must work with uncertaintyand unequally according to circumstances,where, e.g. at the outset no tenders fromenrolled firms are forthcoming - as is likelyto ftappen In the engineering and certain othertrades - and where therefore the need for pressureis greatest - the effect of these measures willbe nil.(a)    ^hey will lead to delays in the pBaoing ofcontracts and in cases where the proposednegotiations with other firms come to nothing,the contracts will go after all to the un-enrolled firms.(4)    Finally, these measures will not altogether avoidextra  financial cost - which it is assumed was themain object of the Cabinet&apos;s modification of thellinister of Labour1 s original proposals.&quot; For, asfirms lose confidence in the established competitivesystem, as they must do under the practice nowsuggested, they will refrain from tenderingaltogether, and competition will in time berestricted to firms who have in the past quotedhigher prices than the offended firms.For these reasons the measures proposed arelikely to result in greater evils than any good that can beexpected of them, and it is hoped, therefore, that it willbe possible for the decision arrived at on the 28thJanuary to be reconsidered.
