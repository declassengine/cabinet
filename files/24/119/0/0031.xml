REPORT.     The Committee were appointed by a Conference ofMinisters held at 10, DoT/ning Street on Tuesday, 25thJanuary,    advise the Cabinet on the steps to he taken  -in the event of an unfavourable reely being receivedfrom tho Building Trade Unions&apos; to the Government proposalsfor employing 50,(300 ox-service men: on housing,&quot;     The Committed has held four meetings.   The following are their recommendations to the Cabinet in the eventstated -     (1)  That a precis of the negotiations by the          Government with the Building Trade Unions, -          showing -how far the Government were prepared to          go in. order to meet their legitimate wishes and          allay their reasonable fears, should be issued          to the Press immediately  on receipt of the reply          from the. Building Trade Unions.   The precis is          set out in Appendix 1,     (2)  That the Minister of Health in England and the          Secretary -for Scotland in Scotland should forth-          with issue  an appeal to Local Authorities, urging          them to arrange or tc ask their  Contractors to          arrange for the introduction of  unemployed ex-          service men on housing schemes actually in          progress or for vtiich contracts  have been signed.
f    The  terms  of  the  proposod  appeal  are set  out  in    Appendix II,(3)  That inasmuch as  Local  Authorities  can  do little    without  the  co-operation of  their contractors, and    these, in turn can do little  without the co-operation    of their Federation, the Cabinet  Committee should be    authorised to disclose  the above  proposal to  the    Federation of Building  Employers  in order, if    possible,  to secure their  oo-operatlono(4)  That. In  the  negotiations with the Building Employers    Federation     (a)   The Committee should be at liberty to state          that the offer io  the Building Trade Unions -          including the concessions in regard to &quot;wet          time&quot; - being a unum quid -  not having been          accepted, is not/ withdrawn,     (b)   In  accordance with the1decision  of the Unomploy-          ment Committee, confirmed by the  Cabinet,  the          Committee Ghould decline toc onsider a system          of  bonus on output if proposed by the employers^     (c)   The question of disclosing the alternative          proposals contained in paragraph  4  of  this          report to be&apos;loft to the exercise of the          discretion of the Committee  in the light of          the negotiations as they proceed.(5)  That conditions relating to the selection    men,     the training and pay of Instructors, and the  -wages     of learners during training, should be as&apos; set out     In Appendix II10(6)  That an  official should be appointed under the     Ministry of Health who should be  charged with the                                                special/
     special duty  of pressing on the employment of ex-service     men on Housing work, who should act as liaison officer     in that matter between  the Ministry of Health and the     L^cal  Authorities,  and  that a similar offioials should be     appointed for Scotland  under the Scottish Board of Health.(7)   That any increase  in the cost of housing schemes     oaused by the training  and employment of unskilled     ex-service men should be charged to a special unemployment .     account on the vote of  the Ministry of Labour, and     should not be borne on  the Housing Vote of the Ministry     of Health. Th* Committee are informed that,  in view     of the novelty of  the problem, of the absence of any     information as to  the amount of satisfactory work which     learners would be  able  to perform, . and the degree of     supervision whioh  they  would require it is very diffi-     oult to make  any oaloulation of the excess cost, but     they estimate it roughly at a sum of  5,000,000 on     the basis of  the employment cf 50,000 ex-service     trainees,  with&quot;the co-operation of local authorities     and contractors.          In the event  of the Government proposals to brim-;     in ex-service men  being rejected not only by the     Building Trades Unions  but also by the Local Authorities  &apos;   and the Building Employers, the committee proceeded to     consider the  alternative or alternatives then open to     the Government.          There would seem in that event to be several ways     in which the  Government oan help to secure employ-     ment in housin; work for these ex-service men.&apos;                            - 3 -
(l)   By concentrating on  new methods of construction which     eliminate  the  employment  of  skilled bricklayers, e.g.     system^ of  concrete construction.  By employing ex-     service men on work  of this  character -which Is outside     the ordinary province of  skilled bricklayers, it may     be. possible to avoid an acute issue With the Building     Trade Unions.(2)   By offering rublic Work3  contractors a oubsidy of  100     per house  on contracts on condition that a fixed pro-     portion of unemployed ex-service men are put on the     work.  This can only be done by maintaining the nominal     relation of principal and agent between the local     Authority  and  the Government the Local Authority agreeing     to allow the use of  their sites and to take over and pay     for the houses.(3)   By offering private  builders an additional subsiay of      100 per house in respect of houses in the building of     which a fixed  proportion  of unemployed ex-service men are     engaged.(4)   By offering to public utility societies a subsidy in re-     opect of houses built by  Unemployed ex-service men equiva*     lent to the subsidy  proposed in the case of private builders.I     The cost of providing the subsidies referred to in     para * (3)   above to  be met out of  the sum of  15 million     already earmarked for housing subsidies.&apos;  The cost of (2)     and (4) would  have to be  included  in the^TSCcial Unemploy-     ment vote  above referred  tc.(5)   By the employment of ex-service men in housing  schemes     already in progress  under the control ef the Office of     Forks orsScottish Board of Health  acting on behalf of  &apos;     local Authorities,   in such  cases  it would appear that     the consent of the Local  Authority would be required,     and the committee are advised that in most cases that     consent would  be withheld.                         - 4  -
                .&apos;&quot;                                      &quot; &apos;&quot;&apos;            (6)  By authorising the offioe of &quot; OTKS  touncier-                take  direct house building  on behalf of the                Ministry of Health and by authorising the                fioard of Health in Scotland, who have large                experience in direct  building,  to build                houses in Scotland.     The Committee are advised by the office of Works thatits staff and organisation are wholly insufficient  for thispurpose, and also that there  is a risk that the building trade Unions in such  an event might withdraw their  labour from all Government building  work.  The  Committee are informedthat the Ministry of  Health have no power to build  housesthemselves unless the Local Authority be in default.  Legis-lation would be of a  complicated character  involving -(1) Power to take over land  already acquired by Local    Authorities and undertake building  thereon.(2) Finance to be provided by the &quot;exchequer out of  monies    provided by parliament,(3) Power to transfer the houses thus built to  Local    Authorities, to compel the latter to accept the houses,    and to be responsible for their management.(4) power to recover the expenditure  from Local Authorities.       The Committee  put forward for  the consideration  of  theCabinet that if legislation is required in  the  matter  it  should include/provision declaring a Local  Authority in default  whichrefuses to comply with the direction of  the Government  that                                              unemployedevery effort should be made to secure the  employment  o^ ex-service men in housing work.     This course would seem to be entirely  justifiable in the -circumstances.  The Government is paying the  piper  and hasa  right to call  the tune.  Apart from this  the method suggestedfurnishes a finanoial pull which the Government can exorciseover Local Authorities,  and no other form of  pressure  willprobably produce the  desired  result.                          -  5 -
If the alternative to refusal on the part of the Local&apos;Authority to comply with the wishes of the Governmentis that all the work would he done at the expense  of the.Local Authority instead of their being liable onl^; fora penny on the rates, the temptation to&quot; c$mply with thewishes of the Government will &quot;be considerable,--6-
     DRjfgu.OFxjTATEMM TO Tg jjgSS.THE BUIIIBINO TRADES AND THE EX-SSRVIOE     The following is a plain statement of fact regarding the  *situation which hat. &quot;arisen on the various proposals for increas-ingthe personnel of the Building Trade by means of unemployed ex-Service men in order to spped Up the completion of the Government1shousing programme, on which&apos;both theoomfert of the community and the possibilities of industrial development in the near future s*largely d spend.     Immediately that the size of tho Governments housing proposalsbecame clear it was evident that the existing personnel in the -Building Trade, particularly of skilled men,&apos; was not adequate tocomplete the housss within a reasonable time, and the Joint Indus-trial Council for the Building Industry early in 1919 authorisedone of its  oint Committeeeg the Building Resettlement Committee,to examine the whole subject.   This Committee was addressed ontho 18th June, 1919, by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof labour who emphasised the urgency of the problem and on the8th&apos;July the Trade Union representatives on the Committee were invited  by&apos; the Minister of Health to give their help in meetingthe situation.                    : ;&apos;   &apos;  In  August 1919 the Committee expressed tho view that ifevery available man trained to the several irades&apos; in the indus-try, not actually then engaged on build ing, took up work on housing  there  would still be- a deficiency of over .100,000 men.     The Committee recommended that no additional labour shouldbe brought in  until every step had been  taken to bring &quot;back men  .who had  left the  industry for other trades during the war and  torooruit  apprentices&apos;under the ordinary trade conditions.     By  December  1919  it became  olear  that  sufficient                                                     progress/
progress was not boing made ana the Prime Ministeraddressed a special mooting of the Joint Industrial Counoiland urged upon it the importance in the national interests  .cf .-.souring sufficient number of men to deal oxpeditiouslywith tho great arrears in housings.  He suggested to theOounoil that a speoial body should be set up to tackle the problem immediately, but the conference decided that theBuilding Resettlement Committee was the one best qualifiedtt handl* the situation.          In February 1920 this Committee issued a further report.   They challenged the figures upon which the Ministryof Health basod its estimates of the amount of labour required,and stated that no shortage might be feared in housing iffull advantage was taken of the existing labour available.This report was in oonflict with all the information beforethe government          The Minister of Health, wishing to take thematter further, approached the Parliamentary Committee of theTrades tfnion Congress.   A special Trade Union Sub-Committeewas established at his&apos; request and suggested machinery forsecuring a better distribution of the existing labour con-ditional on the guarantee of payment of a full week&apos;swages on all housing^ work, but it offered no satisfactoryproposals for increasing the number of men employed. &apos; -          The Government then appointed a special HousingCommittee of the Cabinet whioh in August of last year plaoedproposals before the Building Resettlement Committee for increasing tho supply of labour.   The proposals includedan offer of a guaranteed minimum week on condition that  thetrade accepted certain measures for increasing the number                            ; .                          of/            r             &apos;
of skilled men engaged including the training of ex-Service men who had been prevented by their service with the Forces from entering the industry in the normal way. These proposals were definitely rejected. The Trade Union representatives were not prepared to make any other concession than that in return for some guarantee of Payment for time lost through bad weather, the crafts in the trade which admittedly required augmentation should be brought up to strength by the admission of apprentices up to the number necessary for each craft, and that ex-Service men whose introduction was prevented by the age limit imposed by existing rules upon apprenticeship should be accorded special treatment in this respect.

The Government accepted this concession without prejudice to any further proposals which it might be necessary to put forward to make good the deficiency of labour. The proposals were embodied in the Adult Apprenticeship Scheme, which the Building Resettlement Committee had recommended for acceptance by the various Trade Unions. This scheme is still under consideration by the Unions but the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners, the National Amalgamated Society of Operative House and Ship Painters and Decorators, and the Manchester Units of Bricklayers have already declined to adopt the scheme, and no Union has so far definitely intimated its acceptance.

There continued still to be a serious deficiency of labour on housing schemes, and they were still proceeding ? too slowly: in addition there continued to be a large number of unemployed ex-service men. On the 23rd October 1920, the Minister of Health proposed to the executive council of the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives that in England and Wales 50,000 ex-Service men should be taken on for training in/ 
in the several skilled trades in the industry in thenecessary proportions for work on housing,,   The number was to include men admitted to training under the AdultApprenticeship Scheme.   The Federation replied that before considering the proposals the Government should state what guarantees it would&apos;be prepared to give againstadditional risks of unemployment&apos;which might ensue fromthe admission of ex-Service m6n  in the numbers Suggested.A Special Cabinet Committee in this connection Consideredvarious proposals in great detail / and the Council of theFederation was invited to discuss the matter at the Ministryof Labour en the 2nd December, but replied by requesting theGovernment, to communicate its proposals beforehand.   Accord&quot;ingly on the 18th December Dr* Maciiamar-a informed the Presidentof the Federation that in return .for the admission of 50,000men to the skilled crafts for housing purposes and their train^ing the Government was prepared  to make a training grant of  5per head to the Unions and ir.rould apply the principle of a guaranteed rate of pay on housing operations for.time lost through .stress of weathero   This proposal was designed , Ameet the two chief claims of the Unions? that they should be compensated for-loss of wages owing&apos;to bad weather and that some,provision should be made for the possible risk of unemploymentcaused by the increaso in the number of skilled men available,and it was suggested i-hat the funds obtained through the traininggrants could be used as a supplementary fund to the UnemploymentInsurance Act in dealing with any unemployment that might ariseD          On the 31st December the President and Secretary ofthe Federation replied to Dr* Macnamara^ letter stating that ajoint meeting of the Executive Councils of the Unions affiliatedto the Federation had considered the Government^ proposals,  .                           -10-  v                     r-rirl/
and as no guarantee had been offered against consequentUnemployment and only those crafts which accepted augmentationwould be entitled to any allowance for time lost by stress ofweather, the only new proposal being the offer of a traininggrant, it had been decided that the constituents of therespective Trade Unions should be consulted.            Feb. 3rd, result to come.          For nearly two years, therefore,  the Government hastried every means of inducing the Building Trades to agreeto such augmentation of the existing skilled men as is demnnd-ed by the housing shortage.   The result of thedr effort isset forth above.   Tilveu the very liberal offer of a traininggrant to the Unions has only caused further delay.   The .Government feel that the time has now arrived when it mustdefinitely take action to fulfil its obligations to unemployedex-Service men and at the same time provide for the supply oflabour necessary to complete the Government.housing sohemeas rapidly as possible.   The Government would naturally have preferred to do this with the willing co-operation of theBuilding Trade Unions who also owe a debt to the ex-Servicemen.   They must now go forward without that Co-operation.
                   APPENDIX 11^                Draft of Circular to Local            authorities prepared by the hinistcr                      of Health.     As the local authority aro aware, His kajcsty&apos;s Governmentrecently made proposals for tho augmentation Of building labour with the twofold object of accelerating the production of houses and of providing useful employment for ex-service men.  Thenational Federation of Building Trades Operatives have declined   ,to accept these proposals but tho Government are confident thatthe local authorities and the country generally will support themin the effort they are making to achieve the objects which they hadin view in making these proposals.  The position with regard to unemployment is well known and the Government feel eure that the  -country will not acquiesce in a situation in which there is onthe one hand serious unemployment and on the other delay in thecompletion of houses which are urgently needed.     ^part from the 19,961 houses already y completed by localauthorities, public utility societies and private builders underthe Subsidy Scheme, contracts have been signed or tender * approvedby local authorities for 154.5-12 more.  Of these 55,182 only arein various stages of progress, whilst certificates have been i /suedforthe building of a &quot;further 23,578 houses under the subsidy scheme on the houses now building by local authorities tho total numberofmen at present employed in approximately 80,000 - skilled andunskil ed in roughly equal proportion,  There is immediate needfor the addition of so: ;e 12,000 s)rilled men and a proportionatenum cr of unskilled me::: to secure an adequate rote of progress onthese houses already under construction.  But the extension of
(IV) opyraviohe BO urgently required to convert houses, tendered  oror contracted for into houses actually buildiijg obviously necessi-tut es a very large further.increase; even if no fresh oontraotsare entered into at the. present time*     In these circumstances His Majesty1 o Government have decided      localto invite/ author it    to take the following action.;^     In tho case of schemes In which contracts have been 1st andIn which there is a shortage of skilled building labour which isdelaying the completion cf houses,, the contractor should be askedto arrange for the expansion of the skilled labpur by the intro-duction en to: the tiork of a sufficient number of unemployed ex^service me-nP to be selected from these upon the register of the -Employment Exchange for the are,a*   His Majesty1 s Governmentobviously oould not desire that unemployed ex-service men should beintroduced into the grades of skilled labour where there is already a sufficiency of mon, a*gj painters.   What they have in mind isthe&apos;introduction of men into the grades which are admittedly short;viz* bricklayers^ plasterers, slaters and tllers.*   It will be forthe Contractor tc deoidf- whether these men can be utilised to thebest advantage on work on which labour recruited from other sources is already being employed or on separate blocks of houses under  the supervision of instructors from the ContractorIs existing staff. -     In the case of schemes carried cut by direct administration local-authorities should at cr*ce put themselves In touch with the  - Employment Exchange and make arrangements (a) for the employment of as many ex--servioe men as are required for unskilled work; and (b) for the absorption cf as large  a percentage of ex-service ten  as can with advantage be employed for the purpose of making them  efficient members of the oraf.ts   The limitations  as  to the grades to be recruited stated above should  apply also in these oases.,
     Ex-Service won taken on to be  trained for  craftsmen1 o work should receive 70$ of the district  rate&quot;appronriate  to thecraft for the first three months and increases  to beanadr^Uaere-after on the passing of trade tests to the satisfaction  of the contractor.     Ex-Service men taken on as unskilled labourers  should bepaid the rate paid to unskilled labourers by the  Local authority in the district.  The contractor or the  Local Authority  will be.able to  select the men who show aptitude for &quot;becoming Builders1Labourers and can increase the rates for such men until  they re--ceive tho district rate for Eullders1 Labourers.  Men engaged on road and sewor work on the housing scheme will  be paid the rate&apos;paid by the Local Authority to read men except  in cases  where an award of     Court of Arbitration has determined the  ratefor such class of work in the distriot.    It will generally benecessary to employ skilled instructors and where this is  donethey should be paid as leading hands.     In addition to the action indicated above  for  the augmenta-tion of  labour on work requiring the services of skilledoperatives local authorities shou/ld oonsider the extended useof methods of construction which lend themselves to the  employ-ment of  a materially larger percentage of unskilled labour.     As  local authorities are aware a number of methods  of oon-struction and variety of materials hitherto not generally usedin the  construction cf small houses are now available, and                          fhave been approved by the Minis-cry of Health, and contracts for  the  erection of a very large number of them have been let.     For the most part these involve the use of concrete, andthe adoption  of such methods of construction will go far to relieve  the difficulty occasioned by the  shortage ofbricklayers and plasterers.
January 27th,  lggl.- 15 -        It is desired therefore  that  looal...authoritios should review  heir existing contracts with the object of  substituting so far as possible concrete  for brick houses  and  in entering into any further contracts should  keep  in  view the  advantages of employing to the full the use of speoial methods of  construction and material. &apos;        The services of tho Housing Commissioners  and their&apos; staffs T.111 be fully at the  disposal of local authorities  for dotalled conference on the points  raised in this  circular..

     Two parallel schemes for  the  absorption  of the ex-serviee men who are now suggested  for  the following reasons -(a)   There are at present about 4p, OOO  skilled men engagedcn housing operations,   if there is to be no  interferencewith the pro Teas of these schemes it  will be difficult  to absorb trainees in a higher proportion than 1 to  5 skilled men.  consequently existing schemes could only absorbabout 8,000 trainees.(b)   in addition to the houses now uncer constructionthere are about 100,000 houses for which tenders  have beenapproved and for which  finance and materials  are  forth-coming.  These houses will be  partly extensions cf schemes                            entirely.already in progress and partly/ new schemes, and should provide adequate work for the  absorption of a very large,number of ex-service men.     Pur these reasons  it is sujested that the extensions to existing schemes and now schemes should be commencedentirely with instructors and  trainee Labour.- 18 -
