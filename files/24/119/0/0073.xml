[February 2.]I    CONFIDENTIAL.                                           SECTION 1.[C 2317/386/18]                   No.  1.                 M. Briand to President of German Delegation.(Confidential.)                               Inter-Allied Conference,Sir,                                                 Paris, January 29, 1921.   &apos; THE Allied Conference which met at Paris from the 24th to the 29th January,1921, has taken the following  decisions :     1.  As&apos; regards the  disarmament of Germany,  the  Allied  Governments  have           approved the conclusions formulated in the note attached hereto.    2.  As  regards the question of  reparations, the Allied  Governments  have           unanimously approved the proposals formulated in that document, also           attached hereto.    The  Allied Governments have  on former  occasions, and  again to-day,  inconsenting to fresh delays in  the matter of disarmament, had due regard to thedifficulties which  surround the  German  Government  in the  execution  of  theobligations which have resulted from  the Treaty of Versailles.   They have the firmhope that  the German  Government will not place the Allies, who  confirm their previous  decisions, under the necessity of envisaging the grave situation which willbe created if Germany persists in failing to meet her obligations.    The  qualified delegates of the German Government will be invited to a meeting in London at the end of February, with the  delegates of the Allied Governments.    Please, Sir, accept the assurance of my  consideration.                                                                 BRIAND.                            Enclosure in No. 1.Agreement between the Allied Powers for the Settlement of certain Questions            relating to the Execution of the Treaty of  Versailles.                                   (i.)                      DISARMAMENT INFRINGEMENTS.     1  Reichsheer (army of 100,000 men).         (a.)  Legislation. The final draft of the Military Law drawn up by the German     Government  has not yet been passed.   It contains, moreover,  certain important     omissions, especially with regard to the abolition of compulsory military  service,     which has been laid down for the Reich, but not for each.separate German State.         In  addition,  this draft contains provisions for certain supplementary troops     and for other military organisations which are not clearly  defined.         (b.)  Organisation. The effectives of certain services and a considerable  number     of military non-effectives are not included in the army of 100,000 men.         The number  of officers and  military officials  belonging  to  the   Central     Administration (Ministry of the Reichswehr and the Administrative  Departments     attached to it) is considerably in excess of the number authorised by the treaty (916     instead of 300).     2.  Surrender and Destruction of War Materiel.         In spite of the large quantities of war materiel surrendered and  destroyed up     to  the present, the disarmament of Germany is still far from being completed.  TheI     following points are of special importance :   -          (i.) An important surplus exists on account of the  fact that the reduction of              the strength of the army to 100,000 men has not been accompanied by a              surrender of war materiel proportionate to this reduction.          [5549 6-1] o                                                  B
      (ii.) A large quantity  of war materiel is collected in units,  in depots, or in           arsenals.  Moreover, the German Government claims to retain, under the           guise of materiel required  for  purposes  of  replacement and training,           quantities considerably in excess of those fixed by the treaty.     (iii.) Finally, a considerable number of arms remain in the hands of the civil          , population.                                  Moreover       (iv.) The German Government, in its note of the 24th December, has refused to           carry  out  the decision of  the Conference of Ambassadors  of  the           8th November, and has  delayed surrender of the artillery  materiel of           Ciistrin, Lotzen-Boyen  and  Konigsberg,  and the  surrender of heavy           artillery in excess of that sanctioned by the I.A.M.C.C.      (v.) The German Government, in its note of the 5th January, has demanded           permission to  keep a  large  quantity of materiel  not authorised  by the           treaty  for the armament of land fortresses, including more especially           2,600 machine guns (a number greater than the allotment authorised for           the army of 100,000 men).     (vi.) The German Government has  refused to carry out the decision  of  the&apos;           Conference of Ambassadors  of the 27th December, and  has appealed to           the Allied Governments against this decision.   It has thus postponed the           surrender of materiel not authorised for coast fortresses.  It claims the           retention of 1,086 guns instead of 420 authorised by the I.A.M.C.C.     (vii.) Further, the  abolition  of establishments and military factories,  which           comes under article 168  of the treaty, and the destruction or conversion           of machinery used for war  purposes, under  article  169, have not been           carried out in.accordance with the conditions  laid  down.3. Unauthorised Organisations.     The disarmament of unauthorised organisations has only  just been begun.   Theabolition of these organisations has  not  been carried out.     The German Government, in its letters of the 9th and 22nd December, claimsthe right to retain these organisations in  Bavaria and in  East Prussia,  and  to postpone their disarmament to an indefinite date, which it desires to fix itself.4. Sicherheitspolizei.     The majority of the arms not  authorised for the Sicherheitspolizei have beensurrendered.   But the Sicherheitspolizei has been  simply  transformed into theSchutzpolizei (new designation of  the  German police force), whilst retaining its former composition and organisation.     Thus the disbandment laid down at Boulogne has not been carried out.                     Decisions of  the  Allied Governments.1. With regard to  the Reichsheer (army  of 100,000 men):      The German Government is summoned-     (a.) To  expedite the passing of the new draft of the Military Law (Wehrgesetz)          which is at present before the Reichstag, after having inserted in it&apos;the          modifications necessary in order to make it conform to the conditions of          the  Peace Treaty,  more  especially with regard to  the  question of          compulsory service,  Avhich must be abolished  both with regard to each          State and also with regard  to the Empire.    These  measures must be          taken before the 15th March, 1921.     (b.) To  make the details of the organisation of the Reichsheer (army of 100,000          men) conform to the text of&apos; the Treaty, more especially regarding the          abolition of  the  surplus  of officers  and  officials of  the  Central          Administration.   These  measures must be taken before  the 15th April,          1921.2. With regard to  War Materiel.    With reference  to  war  materiel  in general,  the  German  Government  issummoned     (a.) To expedite the surrender of the remainder of this materiel, especially            (i.) That materiel arising from  the reduction of the German army to                 100,000 men.
           (ii.)  The materiel collected in units, in depots and in arsenals, and in                 addition  that  which  the  German Government  demands to be                 retained for purposes of replacement and training.          (iii.)  The arms still in the hands of the civil population.    (b.) With reference to the guns constituting  the armament of land fortresses.          In reply to the German note of the 24th December, the German Govern-          ment is informed that no armament  can be  retained at Custrin  and          Lotzen-Boyen, and that the fortress  of Konigsberg can only be allowed          to retain the armament authorised by the I.A.M.C.C., i.e.,22 heavy guns.    (c.) With reference to.the armament, other than guns, of the land fortresses.          No other armament can be sanctioned for these fortresses except  that          granted under the terms of the treaty (article 167).    (d.) With reference to the armament of coast fortresses.   Allied Governments          confirm  the   decision &quot;of the  Conference  of  Ambassadors  of  the          27th  December, fixing the armament of  these fortresses in accordance          with  the  resolutions of the I.A.M.C.C. (i.e.,  420 guns instead of 1086          demanded by the German Government).               All the&apos;measures laid down under paragraphs (a), (b),  (c), and (d)          above must be carried out by the 28th February, 1921.    (e.) With reference to factories.   The German Government is summoned           1. To recognise  the  classification  of the factories  which  are to be                 authorised in future to manufacture war material, as laid down                 by the I.A.M.C.C. and I.A.N.C.C.          2. Thereupon to carry out without delay the  necessary alterations and                 the conversion  of unauthorised machinery used for war purposes,                 in accordance with articles 168 and 169 of the treaty.3 &apos; With regard to Unauthorised Organisations.    In reply to the notes of the 9th and 22nd December of the German Government,the Allied Governments maintain the principles of  disarmament and disbandment of these organisations laid down by the Spa Protocol and the  Boulogne note (in execution of articles 177 and 178 of the treaty).  They accord the following  time limits which are necessitated by the actual situation :     (i.) The  promulgation of  legislation  decreeing  the  disbandment  of  all          unauthorised formations,  and prohibiting their re-establishment, under          penalty of &quot;sanction,&quot; must  take place &quot;before the 15th  March,  1921.          The disbandment of all these organisations must be carried out as rapidly          as possible, in order to be completed  by the 30th June at the latest.    (ii.) The arms belonging to these organisations in the whole territory will be          surrendered under the following  conditions: -          (a.)  All weapons other than  small  arms with their  ammunition, and                 two-thirds of the small arms declared by these organisations as                 well as this proportion  of ammunition, must be surrendered bv the                 31st March,  1921.          (b.)  All remaining arms and ammunition to be surrendered bv the 30th                 June,  1921.4. With regard to the Sicherheitspolizei.    In reply to the note of the German  Government of the 3rd January,  the AlliedGovernments confirm the decisions of the Boulogne rpte of the 22nd June, to theeffect that the police must retain  its characteristics of a local organisation, and  mustin no  way  whatever possess  a  centralised organisation,  and must not have anarmament in excess of that laid down by the I.A.M.C.C.    The German Government is also reminded  that the  strength of its police  force must at no time exceed a total strength of 150,000 men.                                Naval  Clauses.    In view of  the  failure of the German Government to comply  with the SpaProtocol of the 9th July, 1920, as regards :       [5549 6-1]                                                    B2
    Paragraph  5          (&amp;.)  The surrender of the documents asked for;         Ic.)  The non-continuance of obstruction;         (d.)  The delivery and surrender of war  material;and further that violations of articles  188 and 191 concerning the total destructionof submarines and the new construction of the same have occurred, the GermanGovernment is called upon :     1. To complete the full delivery of documents demanded by the 28th February,           1921.    2. To complete the disarmament of all vessels in reserve by the 30th April, 1921.    3.

Such articles as do not fall under article 192 will be credited to the ReparationsAccount.                                     II.    The German Government  is also informed that the I.A.N.C.C. will continue tosettle what is war material as already decided by the Council of Ambassadors onthe 3rd September,  1920.  Such material to be surrendered without further delay inaccordance with  article 192 for destruction or rendering useless; in cases where such material can in  the opinion of the  IA.N.C.C. be genuinely  used for commercial purposes, the I.A.N.C.C. to decide and to redeliver such to the German government after  rendering  it ineffective in their opinion for  war purposes,  or assuring them-selves that it will not be used for such purposes.                                    HI.    The laws made by the German Government for carrying out  the Naval clauses of the Peace Treaty are in certain cases inadequate, and the  German Governmentis summoned  to remedy this.                                Aerial Clauses.Infringements.    1. Germany has not surrendered all the aeroplanes, hydro-aeroplanes, motors,balloons, hangars (to be dismantled,  destroyed, despatched or delivered (out  of thecountry)),  balloon  accessories,  wireless  telegraph and  photograph  equipment,hydrogen factories  and reservoirs, machine-guns  and  other aeronautical material(article 202).

Since  the   10th   July,  1920,   Germany  has recommenced  aeronauticalmanufacture  in  spite of the decision taken by the Allied Governments at Boulogneon the 22nd June, and she has attempted to  export the material so manufactured inspite of the formal orders of the Commission of Control (article 201).    3.
