SECRET.THE TREATY  OF SEVRES.GENERAL STAFF VIEWS ON MODIFICATION OF TERMS.Treaty of Sevres.  Part 2.Arti le 27 I. (2).Frontier of Greece. Turkey cedes to Greece the coast line of the Sea of Marmorafrom a point about 1 kilometre south-west of Kalikratia to the southernmost end of theEuropean shore of the Dardanelles.On the 14th January, 1920, the British Naval Section at Paris urged the necessityof ensuring, as far as possible, the passage of the British fleet between the Mediterraneanand the Black Sea under all political conditions. They pointed out that, althoughGreece might be well disposed to the Allies at the time of the ratification of the Treaty,it was impossible to assume that this condition would continue indefinitely. Theyconsidered any proposal which included the handing over of the Gallipoli Peninsula toGreece or to any one nation which might become unfriendly to Great Britain should beresisted.The General Staff are of the opinion that not only should the handing over of theGallipoli Peninsula to a nation which might become unfriendly to Great Britain beresisted, but also the handing over of the Peninsula to a nation which might become soweak that an unfriendly Power might be able to seize it. There is no guaranteethat : (a.) Greece will not some day become unfriendly.(b.) Even if she remains friendly, she will remain strong enough to resist anunfriendly Power.On the 12th February, 1920, the Army Council, in a letter to the Secretary of theCabinet, expressed their complete accord with the Naval view stating that, in theiropinion, the Maritza or the Enos Midia line should be adopted as the Turco-Greekfrontier (preferably the former), as they did not consider that ethnological considerationsaffecting a small number of people should be allowed to influence a strategical problemso important as that, of the Dardanelles. (The General Staff are not satisfied thatGreece has sufficient claim ethnologically.) It is true that, under Article 84 of theTreaty, Greece is bound to assure the freedom of the Straits and to observe allobligations which are imposed on Turkey in this connection. The Army Council,however, do not consider this a sufficient safeguard, and maintain their opinion that theTurco-Greek frontier should be demarcated in such a way that a potentially hostileGreece may not be able to cover the Straits strategically.The General Staff view of the inadvisability of the accession of Thrace by Greece,,in addition to the above objection, is expressed under the heading of Smyrna below.Treaty of Sevres.  Part 3.Section 4.Smyrna. The General Staff have always been strongly opposed to the invasion ofAnatolia by Greece and have considered this to be the greatest source of irritation tothe Turks, who regard it, not without reason, as a dishonourable breech of theArmistice. It was this invasion, presented to the General Staff in May,. 1919, as a faitaccompli, which brought about the present situation in Anatolia, and, the view of theGeneral Staff is that the retention of the Greeks in the Smyrna vilayet will be thecause for the continuation of the present state of affairs, even if it does not make itworse. Financially, the Greeks cannot hope to maintain a sufficient body of troopsin Anatolia and Thrace indefinitely to maintain their position. The Allies cannot help.them either financially or with men. The late Greek successes are no criterion of theirability to maintain their position. . General Harington has expressed, as his consideredopinion, his views that the value of the Greek Army has deteriorated. It was theconduct of their late &quot; successful operation&quot; which greatly led to the formation of thisopinion. The General Staff agree with this view, and their latest information leadsthem to believe that the unsound financial position of Greece may soon result in anirregular issue, if not practical suspension, of pay to the Army, which will furtherdiminish its value by discontent and desertion.(E21/P6)   100  2/21   H&amp;S,Lfcd  8968wo
In a General Staff Memorandum circulated to the Cabinet on the 1st April, 1920,-prior to the Conference at San Remo, the following passage appears : &quot; The General Staff, who are concerned only with British interests, have nodesire to labour the Greek question, but desire to record their opinion that therewill be no satisfactory settlement -of the Turkish question until Greek ambitionsare curbed. It follows that the Turks should retain their administrative positionin, and access to, Adrianople, while Smyrna should remain under the Turkish flag,unless the Allies are prepared to make greatly increased forces available and toundertake operations on a large scale sufficient to secure the practical elimination ofTurkey.&quot;To sum up, the General Staff are of the opinion that to persist in the.present proposals for peace with Turkey, with existing forces at the disposal of theAllies, is to risk a great blow to British prestige without auy corresponding return,and  probably to  cause  massacres of Christians and Armenians  on  a  scaleunprecedented even in Turkey.&quot;The General Staff see no reason to alter their opinion expressed thus 10 monthsago, and, in fact, feel that the course of events during this, period has justified theirexpression of apprehension and has strengthened their arguments in favour of curbingGreek ambitions.Treaty of Sevres.  Part 3.Section 6.Armenia. According to Article 89, all Powers concerned agree to submit to thearbitration of the President of the United States of America the question of the frontierto be fixed between Turkey and Armenia. President Wilson has drawn up a boundarywhich includes, inter alia, Trebizond in Armenia.In their letter dated the 12th February,. 1920, the General Staff pointed out thedifficulties which Armenia would have to face were she to be given so large a territory.They showed that either the Allies or the Armenians would have to undertakemilitary operations to drive out the Turks from such portions of Eastern Anatolia asmay be granted to Armenia, and the maintenance of a large force to preserve thefrontier, when gained, against Turkish attacks. These difficulties have now increasedowing to the decrease of Allied forces throughout the world, and the late defeatsof Armenia at the bands of Kiazin Kara Bekr. These defeats have shown theimpossibility of Armenia winning unaided from the Turks such territory as may begranted to her, and the danger of supplying the Armenians with arms, which will onlyfind their way into the hands of either the Turks or BolsheviksThe General Staff are of opinion that, as no successful military operations can beexpected, the only means whereby an independent Armenia can be formed is for theTurks and Armenians to come to some understanding on the formation of an autonomousArmenia under Turkish suzerainty, with certain Turkish guarantees. This need notand does not imply that the General Staff advocate the inclusion of the pre-war KussianArmenia in the new autonomous state.Treaty of Sevres.  Part 5.Section 1. Chapters 1 to 8.  .Military Qlauses-JJnder the Military Clauses of the Treaty the armed forces atthe disposal of Turkey H confined to : (1.) The Sultan&apos;s bodyguard.(2.) Troops of Gendarmerie intended to maintain order and security in the interiorand to ensure the protection of minorities.(3.) Special elements intended for the reinforcement of the troops of Gendarmeriein case of serious trouble, and eventually to ensure control of the frontiers.(This is what will remain of the Regular Army 15,000 all ranks).It will be noted that no Turkish Begular Army, beyond the 15,000 men mentionedin (3), is contemplated by the Treaty, and that officers supplied by the various Alliedand Neutral Powers shall collaborate under the direction of the Turkish Government inthe command, the organization and the training of the Gendarmerie, although they will;   . not be included in the strength of Gendarmerie officers authorized by the Treaty.
In their letter, dated the 12th February, 1920, the Army Council pointed out thatTurkish troops should normally be called upon in cases of civil disorder, where military-assistance might be necessary, and that the Inter-Allied force of occupation shouldavoid interference with the civil population as much as possible. They drew attentionto a General Staff Note, dated 14th January, 1920, giving reasons for the retention of aRegular Army in Turkey,   They were : (1.) By the Treaty Turkey will find herself with frontiers with Greece, Armeniaand Georgia. The situation on any of these may be such as to engenderappeals by Turkey if she is not allowed to retain a sufficient armed force forher own protection. Should this not be forthcoming, she will have apretext for the formation of irregular frontier bands, leading to inevitablelawlessness and reprisals.(2.) The preservation of internal securitv and the protection of minorities in theinterior of Turkey calls for armed force.(3.) The possession of a Regular Army leads to the general stability of anycountry.(4.) The Turkish Government might justifiably plead incapacity to maintain orderif the assistance of Regular troops were denied her.They were of the opinion that the supervision by Allied officers of the TurkishGendarmerie appeared likely to lead to International friction and jealousy, and to be ameasure which it was desirable to avoid.(N.B. We have already suffered much from French and Italian propaganda.)The friction prophesied by the General Staff has already started in the attitudeadopted by the French towards General Harington and in the late French Notedemanding the presidency of the Sub-Committee of Organization. The abolition of theTurkish Regular Army has been taken by the Nationalists as one of the points whichit is necessary for us to reconsider before they come to terms with us.The General Staff are still of the opinion that Turkey should be allowed to retaina reasonable sized Regular Army under Turkish officers, in . the same way as otherEnemy Powers, in addition to a Gendarmerie.Moreover, it would appear that, in order to come to terms with the Allies, Turkeymust quarrel with the Bolshevik Government, and the situation thus created may atany time lead to war. If Turkey is denied a Regular Army, she cannot be expected toresist the Bolsheviks.Teeaty of Sevres.   Part 5.Section 5.   Article 207.This article which provides that no Allied Powers shall enlist or employ intheir Armies, Fleets or Air Services any Turkish national, ends with the followingsentence : &quot; The present provision does not, however, affect the right of France to recruitfor her Foreign Legion in accordance with French military laws and regulations.&quot;The General Staff took strong exception to the insertion of this sentence on theground that the French in Syria are on interior lines as regards Egypt and Mesopo-tamia, that practically the whole of the troops used by the French at present, andprobably in future, are non-European or foreign legionaries, and, should the French begiven permission to enlist Turks for their foreign legion, we may soon find a large andefficient Turkish Army under a French staff in a central position ready to turn us outof Mesopotamia or Egypt, as the case may be.The General Staff adhere to their view.Recapitulation.To recapitulate, the General Staff are of the opinion that the terms of the Treatyof Sevres ^should be modified in their relation to (a.) Greek ambitions in Anatolia and Thrace., lb.) The Ottoman Army and system of control of the Gendarmerie. *(c.) Armenia.(d.) The French claim to recruit Turks for their Foreign Legion.The General Staff have based their objections to the above points mainly on theiroriginal standpoint, which was, to a great extent, confined to the local military situation.(8968)
They carefully avoided any political forecast, although they felt strongly that politicalsituations would arise, necessitating military action which they wished to avoid andfelt could be avoided. They felt strongly that, once known or even suspected, theunnaturally harsh terms of the Treaty would arouse Moslem antagonism and intrigueagainst Great Britain throughout the world, and would produce a situation which wouldgreatly assist the Soviet Government in its campaign against Great Britain.An early announcement by the British Premier, emulating the famous dictum ofMr. Gladstone, that the Turks must be turned out of Europe, and the newspapercontroversy early in. 1919 regarding a Greek occupation of Smyrna, gave a clue to theMoslem world to the possible lines on which the Peace Treaty would be drawn up.In May, 1919, Greek troops landed in Smyrna, and Moslem fears werestrengthened. A direct result was the rise of the Nationalist movement in June, 1919.At the same time the Afghan war broke out. From this time onward events havetaken a definitely anti-British trend.   Put briefly, they are : (1.) The formation of the Angora Government and its anti-British attitude.(2.) The Turko- Bolshevik. Agreement.(3.) The outbreak in Mesopotamia in the summer of 1920.(4.) The appearance in Trans-Caucasia of an ever-increasing Bolshevik force.(5.) The increase and success of Bolshevik propaganda in the East, particularlyIndia.(6.) The activities of Indian Mohamedans in India and elsewhere.(7.) The attitude of the Arabs in Trans-Jordania.(8.) The non-ratification of the Anglo-Persian Agreement.(9.) The appearance of Bolsheviks in Giian.(10.) The extinction of Armenia.(11.) The arrogant attitude adopted by the Afghans.(12.) The ill-concealed threat by Ibu Saud that if we clo not help him, someoneelse will.(13.) The persistent attitude of resistance adopted by Egyptian Nationalists.(14.) The ever increasing Moslem unrest&apos; in India.With all these examples before them, the General Staff feel bound to register aprotest against terms, in whose favour they see no military advantages and againstwhich they forsee unending complications, which, with the present troops at theirdisposal, they view with grave misgivings.The General Staff feel that they can do little better in this connection than torepeat below telegram No. P. 595, dated the 28th January, 1921, from the Viceroyof India, with which they are in complete accord-&quot; You\ will have gathered from our last weekly telegram our views as to thepolitical situation. We are examining the question of our general policy towardsnon-co-operation and in relation to internal questions which are among the causes ofdiscontent, and we hope shortly to be in a position, after consulting Local Governmentson certain points, to formulate in detail the measures we propose to take to dealwith the situation. One of the most dangerous factors in the problem which confrontsus is, however, Moslem unrest over the Turkish peace terms. Whatever may havebeen the origin of the Khilafat movement, it is now pre-eminently a religious onewhich has secured very general support. Even loyal Mohamedans, feeling rightlyor wrongly that the terms are not just or consistent with published pledges, areunable to oppose the movement or face the religious pressure that is brought to bearon them, more especially the accusation of being Kaffirs. So far the movement hasnot resulted in violence, save in one or two places, because the policy of the leaderof the campaign is, at any rate for the present, to avoid violence ; but we havereason to know that extreme Mohamedan leaders are quite prepared to advocateimmediate recourse to violence, and are confident of securing support for such a move,both within and outside India, by an appeal to ignorant and fanatical Mohamedansthat Islam is being crushed; the danger of disorder will also be greater when thenon-violence programme fails. In these circumstances, we fear that the refusalsubstantially to modify the Turkish peace terms, more particularly because of thegeneral and &quot;deep-rooted conviction that England alone blocks the way, may haveconsequences of a very grave character on the peace and tranquility of thiscountry, and we feel it incumbent on us, in view of our responsibility to HisMajesty&apos;s Government, to Parliament, and to tbe people &apos;of India once more to jplaceon official record, in the plainest language, our deep misgivings on this subject.
588It is our considered opinion that the only way of eradicating or even of allayingMoslem (? excitement) is by a real modification of the treaty. The difficulties whichthe Turkish peace terms have created in our foreign relations, more particularly inregard to peace negotiations with Afghanistan and the Persian crisis; thefacilities they afford for Pan-Islamic intrigue and Bolshevik propaganda,and the dangerous effect which the religious feeling created thereby musthave on Indian Mahomedan soldiers, have already been placed before you,and the present telegram is intended to deal with the internal situation only. Fromthis aspect we venture to urge once again that you should place before His Majesty&apos;sGovernment our reading of the situation here, and impress upon them the urgentneed for a modification of the treaty, not merely in the interests of his Majesty&apos;sIndian Moslem subjects, but for the preservation of tranquility in India. We arewell (? aware) (? that the) extremist class of political agitators will not be appeasedby any such modification, but we feel that if you succeed in securing it you willstrengthen very greatly the hands of our friends, detach a most influential sectionof Mohamedan (1 opinion), namely, the section actuated by religious motives, fromthe present anti-Government agitation, and will materially assist us in avoidingserious internal disorder.&quot;General Staff,War Office,16th February, 1921.
