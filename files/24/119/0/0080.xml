to  the RIGHT  HONOURABLE SIR  ERIC  GEDDES,   G.C.B.,  G.B.E.,  M.P.,                          Minister of Transport.SIR,    On the 24th September, 1920,  you appointed us  a Committee to enquire into  the  Agreements  made  between  the  Government   and  the  RailwayCompanies,  relating to  the possession by the Government  of the undertakings of the  Companies, and to report to you oh the various matters specified  in our terms  of Reference.    We have  met on  17 days and have taken evidence from  the  followingwitnesses:         Sir J.  George Beharrell,  D.S.O.,  Director-General of Finance  and            Statistics,  Ministry of Transport.        Sir William F. Marwood,  K.C.B.,  Director-General of Public  Safety            and General Purposes,  Ministry  of Transport; formerly  Joint            Permanent Secretary, Board of Trade.        Sir  Alexander  Gibb,   G.B.E.,   C.B.,   Director-General  of   Civil            Engineering, Ministry of Transport.        Sir Albert Wyon, K.B.E., Senior Partner of Messrs. Price,  Waterhouse            &amp; Co.,  Chartered Accountants; Government Accountant.        Sir William Plender,  G.B.E.,  Senior Partner of  Messrs. Deloitte,            Plender,  Griffiths &amp;  Co.,  Chartered Accountants;  Government            Accountant.        S!ir Alexander  Kaye Butterworth,  General Manager, North Eastern            Railway, Member of late Railway Executive Committee.    The circumstances under which Sir Alexander Butterworth&apos;s evidence wasgiven are indicated at the commencement   of his Proof (Appendix XXVI).    At our first meeting we  came to the conclusion that it was undesirable thatthe investigation should be  prejudiced by public discussion, on the basis  of a partial disclosure of the evidence,  of the complicated and far-reaching issues involved, and  we accordingly decided  to  sit in private and to refrain from publishing  the  evidence currently.  We are of opinion, however,  that  in theevent of our Report, being  made public,  it is  desirable that the  Minutes ofEvidence and Appendices should be published at the same time.                              CHAPTER  I.                            PRELIMINARY.    1.   The Agreements, as to the nature and terms of which we were desired to  Characterreport, are contained in a mass of documents and correspondence extending over  of Com-a period of several years.                                                    mittee&apos;s    No document exists which records any clearly defined agreement between the  ti^B lga&quot;Government and the Railway Companies, so far,  at  all events, as to cover thedetails of its application, and while the principles intended to govern the arrange-Government were laid down at the outset of the transaction and defined in a short memo-randum, it was inevitable that points of detail should continually arise which required settlement, and arrangements to meet the exigencies of the moment were adopted, sometimes with the approval of the Board of Trade and of the Treasury,sometimes with the authority of the Government Accountants, and sometimes even with&quot; the authority of the Railway Executive Committee alone.  These arrange-ments were again frequently subject to further change to meet the changed cir-cumstances.  Not unnaturally an agreement of such a  character has proved laek-ing in definition arid precision, and susceptible to varied interpretations.    In the circumstances we think it desirable to state clearly at the outset thestandppint from which we have approached the matters referred to us,    The interpretation of  agreements is normally  a matter of law, and therewould appear to be room for wide differences of opinion as to the strict legal con-struction to be put upon the numerous financial  arrangements, to a large extentloosely  defined, that have from time to time been made between the Governmentand the controlled  Railway Companies.  This  Committee is not competent  toexpress legal dicta, and we do not apprehend that anything in the nature of legal   32046                                                               A
          interpretation was desired of us.   We wish, however,  to  record  unequivocally          that we have made no attempt to deal with questions of legal construction, and to          disavow  in  advance any intention of expressing opinions, or putting forward          arguments, as to the strict legal position between the parties.            To some extent it has been necessary, in order  to  form judgments as to the          merits of particular portions of the agreements or their effects in varying  circum-          stances, to consider what were  the  intentions  of the parties  underlying the          original agreement, and the subsequently agreed interpretations or amplifications          of it, in so far as these intentions are expressed or implied by the documents,  or          can reasonably be deduced from  the  surrounding  circumstances.   From  time  to          time in the course of this Report there will accordingly be found arguments based          upon views we have formed as to  the  intention of the parties.   Our primary          object, however, has not been to interpret the documents by reference to the inten-          tions underlying them.             The task we have set ourselves has been rather  to examine the documents and          the construction which has, in practice, been put  upon them, to consider their          operation in  the light of  present knowledge, and to endeavour to interpret the          agreements, not by a narrow construction of the terminology of documents, or by          a mere  revision  of the intentions underlying them, but  on the broad  ground of          principle upon which they were expressed to be founded at the outset.Negotia-       2.  In order that the attitute that we have adopted may be understood  andhon of     appreciated,  it is  desirable to indicate the manner in which the various agree-meiits&quot;     ments have from time to time been negotiated.             The negotiating parties were, on  the one side,  the responsible, officials of the          Board of Trade and the  Treasury, and, on the other, the General Managers of          twelve of the more important Railway Companies.  The choice of the latter body          was due to the fortuitous circumstance that there was  in existence,  readily avail-          able, a Committee the Railway Executive Committee which had been set up for          another purpose, namely, to exercise operating control of the railways on behalf of          the Government.  These General Managers were not in a position to commit the          Companies generally, or even their own Companies, to the acceptance of any par-          ticular agreement, but their commendation was naturally of considerable  weight          with the respective Boards of Directors.             The discussions which took place were to a large extent personal and in-          formal; the &quot; agreements &quot;  concluded were in the nature of periodical inter preta-          tions of  a general understanding,  which was never completely and exhaustively          recorded.  The original Agreement, though in formal terms, was one the applica-         tion of which, even if the conditions obtaining in August, 1914, had remained         substantially unmodified,  would obviously raise many  points of detail for subse-         quent discussion, and, in fact, as time went on and economic conditions altered, a         number of important questions, which were not specifically covered by the terms of         the original formula, were raised by the Railway Executive Committee.             While giving full recognition to the public-spirited attitude adopted through-          out by the members of the Railway Executive Committee, it is necessary to point          out that their position in regard to the negotiations was one of advantage.   They         were experts dealing with their own subject, whereas the officials with whom they          negotiated were not experts, and  were overwhelmed  with the consideration of          other important  matters.   We do  not  minimise the  fact that the Board of Trade          and the Treasury  sought the advice in regard to  accounting questions of two         eminent  Chartered Accountants.   Despite this, we are of opinion that  to  say         that the  Railway Companies were in  an advantageous bargaining position is  a         true statement of the case, and in  putting it forward we do not desire  to suggest         that they were actuated by improper motives or  took undue advantage  of  the         position in which they found themselves.             Circumstances being as they were, however, it is not surprising that as time         went on the interpretations and amplifications of the original Agreement resulted         in a gradual bettering of the bargain in favour of the Railway Companies.  The         points that were brought up were brought up from the Railway side; they were         points in regard to which the Railway Executive Committee thought that, without         interpretation  or amplification,  the Companies would  be damnified.  There was         consequently a gradual definition of the Railway  Companies&apos; rights  under  the         Agreement,&quot; while  there was no corresponding definition  of the  rights  of  the          Government.   The result of this process is clearly  seen in  the fact that there is         an almost complete absence of reciprocity in the detailed  arrangements.
    It is probable that the consequences of what can only be described as a lament-able lack of precision in many ot the documents would not have been considerablehad the period of possession been limited to the actual war period.    It is easy to be wise after the event, and the  Committee hesitate to  attachundue  blame to the Government for lack of prevision, having&apos; regard  to the sur-rounding circumstances.    It must be remembered that the war came on the country like a bolt fromthe blue.  Results were everything; financial considerations of  comparatively small account.  No experience existed which would offer any guide, such as was subsequently enjoyed when the control of Industry  in other directions came to beundertaken.    Moreover, there is no doubt that it was the general opinion that the war would  not be of long duration.  It was therefore necessary  to do nothing morethan make  a provision which would be perfectly satisfactory on  the  assumptionthat it is intended for but a limited time.    It was recognised from the outset that the nature of the agreement into whichthe Government had entered was such as to  impose a position of trust  on theCompanies,  and in a  Circular  Letter dated  13th August,  1914, the railway executive Committee recorded their view of the position in the following terms \-           &quot; It is hardly necessary to point out that the arrangement is one which       in spite of its great convenience both to themselves and the Companies, the       Government could not have agreed to, had  they not been assured  of the       absolute good faith of the Companies, and  had they not felt certain that       they could rely on all  officers of the Companies concerned acting loyally up       to the spirit of the arrangement.&quot;    We desire unequivocally to record our  opinion that throughout the negotia-tions the Members of the Railway Executive Committee realised this spirit to thefull a spirit which was consistently exhibited in Circular Letters issued fromtime to time to the individual Companies.    3.  The fact that the Agreements have been entered  into and carried out in  settlement the manner indicated above involves that outstanding questions should  be similarly  of Out-dealt with.   It would be a matter for regret if the spirit of mutual trust and  q^&quot;^&quot;^fair dealing which has hitherto characterised both the negotiation of the Agree-ments and their application were to give place, in the final settlement, to one oftenacious insistence upon documentary rights.    It is unfortunately the case, however, that the  conditions which promotedthe personal and informal discussion of the Agreements, and their interpretationduring the war, no longer  exist.  The  Railway Executive Committee has been dissolved, and though some of  its members  are still associated  in the general managers&apos; Committee  they  are no longer in any fiduciary relationship with theGovernment.  War enthusiasm and the spirit which flowed from it have to a largeextent departed, and indeed it is natural that in the changed conditions of to-day the Railway Companies should be  concerned  to protect their shareholders.    We do not suggest that  the members of the late Railway Executive Committeeand those immediately associated with them will not be found willing  to negotiate a settlement of outstanding questions in the same spirit of reasonable accommoda-tion that characterised the negotiation of the Agreements, but there is the difficulty that whereas that negotiation was carried on informally and personally, with anunauthorised body of Railway Managers, the settlement must be with the individual companies, all  of whom may not have the same appreciation of the underlyingspirit of the, Agreements as  has been evidenced by members of the Executive Com-mittee.  As early as 1916, the Executive Committee found that no less than 23Companies were incurring expenditure on maintenance, at the cost of  the Govern-ment,  which appeared to be excessive.   A meeting  of representatives of  these companies was held,  at which members  of  the Railway Executive  Committeeimpressed upon them the honourable obligation undertaken by the Railway Execu-tive Committee to see that advantage was not taken of the Agreements to improverailway undertakings at the expense of the State; in the report  of this meeting,   -submitted to the Railway Executive Committee, it was stated that the meeting hadnot been without advantage in the case of some Companies not closely associatedwith the Committee.   If the attitude of the Members of the Railway ExecutiveCommittee was not shared by all the Companies in the early years of the war, it is less likely that it will be so shared now.     Owing to incomplete definition of the rights of the Government, constructionsare being put upon the Agreements which appear to us  to be inequitable, andopposed to the intention of the representatives of the Government and the Railway    32046                                                              A 2
          Companies by whom they were negotiated.   The settlement of these questions is in          reality the continuation and completion of the process of interpretation to which          we have referrea1.

The relations which have subsisted between the Government and the of the  controlled Railways of Great Britain and Ireland during and since the war, haveEWoes Act,  tnejr orjgjn jn the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, the relevant provisions of          which are as follows :                     &quot; 16.   When Her Majesty, by Order in Council, declares that an einer-               gency has arisen in which it is expedient for  the public service that Her               Majesty&apos;s Government should have control over the railroads in the United               Kingdom, or any of them, the Secretary of State may, by warrant under his               hand, empower any person or persons named in such warrant to take               possession in the name or on behalf of Her Majesty of any railroad in the               United Kingdom, and of the plant belonging thereto, or of any part thereof,               and may take  possession of any  plant without taking  possession of the               railroad itself, and to use the same for  Her Majesty&apos;s service at such times               and in such manner as the Secretary of  State may direct; and the directors,               officers, and servants of any such railroad shall obey the directions of the               Secretary of State as to the user of such railroad or plant as aforesaid for               Her Majesty&apos;s service.                    &quot; Any warrant granted by the said Secretary of State in pursuance of               this section shall remain in force for one week only, but may be renewed               from week to week so long as, in the opinion of the said Secretary of  State,               the emergency continues.                   &quot; There shall be paid to any person or body of persons whose railroad or               plant may be taken possession of in pursuance of this section, out of moneys               to be  provided by Parliament, such full compensation for any loss or injury               they may have sustained by the exercise of the powers of the Secretary of               State under this section as  may be agreed upon between the said Secretary               of  State and the said person or body of persons, or, in case of difference,               may be settled by arbitration in manner provided by &apos; The Lands Clauses               Consolidation Act, 1845.&apos;                    &quot; Where any railroad or plant is taken possession  of in the name or on               behalf of Her Majesty  in pursuance of this section all contracts and engage-               ments between the person  or body  of  persons whose railroad  is so taken               possession of and the directors, officers,  and servants of such person or body               of persons or between such  person or body of persons and any other persons               in  relation  to the working or maintenance of  the railroad, or in relation               to the supply or working of the plant of such railroad, which would, if such               possession  had not been taken, have been enforceable by or against the               said person or body of  persons, shall during the continuance of such posses-               sion be enforceable by or against Her Majesty.                    &quot; For  the purposes of  this section  &apos; railroad &apos; shall include any tram-               way,  whether worked by  animal or mechanical  power, or partly in one way               and partly in the other, and any stations, works, or accommodation belong-               ing to or required for the working of such railroad or tramway.                    &quot; &apos; Plant&apos; shall include any engines, rolling  stock, horses, or other               animal or mechanical power, and all things necessary for the proper work-               ing of a  railroad or tramway which  are not  included  in  the word               &apos; railroad.&apos; &quot;..              2.  Acting under the powers  thus conferred upon him, the Secretary of State0r&apos;^     for War took possession of the controlled Railways of Great Britain as from mid-sion of     inght, 4th-5th August, 1914.  The warrant under which possession was taken was&quot; Control.&quot;  valid for one week only, and was in fact renewed weekly until August, 1919, when          statutory provision in the Ministry of Transport Act rendered its continuance          unnecessary.              In  September, 1916, the Chairman of the  Railway Companies Association          was informed by  the President of the Board of Trade that &quot; the Government          undertakes  to extend the  period of guarantee of net receipts to two years after          the termination of the war.&quot;  It was stated  in evidence that this extension was          given in order to  induce the Companies to re-open negotiations with the men&apos;s          Unions, with a view to averting  a threatened strike at a crucial period.   The          Companies had asked for a considerably longer extension.
    By provision in the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, Section (3) (1) (a), theGovernment took upon itself a statutory obligation to retain possession  for aperiod of two years from the passing of the Act, Le., up to 15th August, 1921,&quot; on the same terms as  to compensation as those heretofore in  force.&quot;    In theabsence of this provision, which was regarded as a fulfilment of the undertaking given by the Government in 1916, the period of control would have been even moreprotracted, as, owing to the lapse of time before  the final termination of the warcan be fixed, the two years would not yet have commenced to run.  Even with this limitation, however, the period of possession will have extended no less than twoyears and nine months beyond the actual war period, and the Companies will havehad the benefit of a State guarantee for a considerable length of  time beyond thatjustified by  the  military needs of the country.    This latter period will have included a railway strike, a coal strike and a serious trade depression, the effects of which, even with railway rates at an economic level, would, in the absence of aState guarantee, have been felt by railway shareholders in the  form of reduceddividends.   In obtaining from the  Government, in 1916, an undertaking that theguarantee should be extended for two years after the war, the Companies securedan advantage to which they would appear to have no sort of title under the act of 1871.     It will  thus be seen that in the course of time the character of the Govern-ment&apos;s &quot; possession &quot; of the Railways has undergone a complete change.  It beganas a temporary  control  of traffic for purely military  purposes, with a liability for compensation for purely military acts; it has developed into a comprehensivefinancial transaction, entirely divorced from  military  considerations,  covering the whole area of railway administration, and continuing long after  the circum-stances which originally justified it have ceased to exist.    3.  A list of  the undertakings of which possession has been  taken  will be  Under-found in Appendix I, page 147. The only Railways not controlled are the London  ^J^8Tube Railways and a number of isolated Light Railways throughout the country,  p0gaessionwhich were  regarded  as being of  no military  importance.   The Metropolitan  was taken.District Railway was, however, taken into possession; but by special arrangementthe Government has no longer any liability in respect of the current working ofthis undertaking.    The Irish Railways were &quot; controlled &quot; as from 1st January,  1917.    4,  The Act of 1871, quoted above,  provided that the owners of the under-  Npgotia-takings of which possession was taken should receive such full compensation for  tl^\ .  jany loss or injury they might sustain,  by reason of the exercise of the  powers con-  Asree.ferred upon  the Secretary of State, as might be agreed between the parties, or in  ment.default of agreement, should be settled by arbitration.   It was clear that someCompanies would suffer loss of revenue by reason of Government control of trafficfor war purposes,  and that those  Companies would have to be compensated forsuch  loss.  There  was doubt, however, whether the  Government would be en-titled to retain the abnormal receipts of those Companies whose traffic benefited.in consequence of war requirements.   The Board of Trade were anxious to over-come this difficulty by dealing with the Railways  as a whole, instead of with individual Companies, and had suggested  that for this purpose a pool of railwayrevenue should be formed.  The Railway Executive Committee,  however, were ofopinion that a pool was unnecessary, as in their view the revenue of the RailwayCompanies whose undertakings were taken over would belong to the Government.The Board of Trade were advised that there was doubt as to the legal position,and that it would be well to conclude an agreement with the Companies,  as pro-vided bv the Act, defining the compensation to be paid.    Accordingly a formula was put forward by the Board of Trade, under whichthe compensation  to be paid  was  defined as being the ascertained deficiency,as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year (or, alternatively,of. the previous three years), in the aggregate net receipts of all the controlled Com-panies, less  any amount  of such deficiency attributable  to causes other than theoperation of the Regulation of the Forces Act,  1871.     The Railway Executive Committee objected to the proposal that the average net receipts  of the previous three years should be taken as the basis of compensa-tion, on the ground that, owing to the change in the statutory form of  accounts,introduced in 1913, the published net receipts of that year were not strictly corn-parable with the corresponding figures for 1911 and 1912,  and further, that therevenue of 1911 and 1912 had been adversely affected by exceptional circumstances,    32046                                                              A 3
         such as coal and other strikes, which had operated unevenly as between individual         Companies              The representatives of the Railway Companies also maintained that it would         be impracticable to differentiate the amount of the deficiency not due to the opera-         tion of the Act  of 1871, and submitted a memorandum  designed  to show that a         simple guarantee of  the net receipts of 1913 would, in the circumstances contem-         plated, provide a fair definition of the compensation to which the Companies were         entitled, viz., compensation for loss or injury due to the exercise of the powers of         the Secretary of State.              It  was clearly the object of the parties in  these early discussions to find a         formula which should fairly assess the limited compensation to which the Com-         panics were entitled under the  Act.   It  was made clear  to the Board of Trade,         however, that an agreement on the basis of a pool of railway revenue, accompanied         by a  State guarantee,  which was regarded by both  parties  as the only form of         agreement affording the facilities necessary to  meet the requirements of the emer-         geney, would not be accepted by the Railway Companies if any attempt were to be         made to limit the deficiency to be made up, under the guarantee, to the deficiency         attributable to the operation of the Act.  It thus appeared to the Board of Trade         that the only means of protecting the State against undefined, and possibly large,         claims to compensation at the end of the  period of possession, was to guarantee a,         certain quantum of net receipts, from whatever cause deficiency might arise.              While appreciating the difficulties of the Railway Executive Committee in         accepting a guarantee which would differentiate the effects of causes  other than         the operation of the Act of 1871, we are of opinion that  considerable  unforeseen         advantages have accrued to the Companies in conseauence of the exclusion of the         limiting words originally proposed by the Board of Trade.Guarantee      5  jn  these circumstances it was  agreed,  on  6th  August,  1914,  that theRecefts   compensation payable under the Act of 1871 should be ascertained in  accordance         with the following formula :                     &quot; To ascertain the compensation payable the aggregate net receipts of                all the Railways taken over during the period for which  they are taken                over  shall be compared with a similar aggregate for  the corresponding                period of the previous year. The ascertained deficiency shall be  the amount                of compensation due.  Provided that if the aggregate net receipts for the                first half of the year 1914 are less than the aggregate net receipts for the                first half of the year 1913, the  ascertained deficiency shall be  reduced in                the like proportion.   Any question as to the amount of the deficiency shall,                in default of  agreement, be  determined  by the  Railway  and Canal                Commission.&quot;              This formula was expressly accepted by  all the controlled main line Com-         panies, but formal assent does not appear to have been  given by the leased and         worked Companies.  The latter have assented by implication-by accepting  pay-         rnents on the same basis as the main line Companies with one exception, in which         a worked line declines to accept the 1913 basis of revenue and claims to  have traffic         receipts divided in accordance with its agreement with the working Company.              If, as  was then  contemplated,  the period of  possession  had  not lasted         more than  a   few  months,  a  guarantee of  net  receipts,  without  ad just-         men^ in respect of  deficiency attributable to general causes, might  in all  pro-         bability have provided a  reasonable measure of the compensation  to which the         Companies were entitled  under  the Act of 1871, i.e., compensation  for loss or         injury  directly  due  to the exercise of the powers conferred  by that  Act on the         Secretary of Stale for War.              With the prolongation of control, and the extensive changes of conditions thai         ensued, the Companies have been protected,  hot merely against loss or  injury         resulting from the exercise of  the powers of the Secretary of State under the         Regulation of the Forces Act, but against other consequences  of the war arising         during  the period of possession.  Indeed, as we have already said, the protection         has  extended far beyond the direct consequences of the war and has relieved         railway shareholders from the loss they would  otherwise have, sustained as the         result of post-war disturbances and depression of trade.              This protection was not shared by other Public Utility Companies, and we are         of opinion,  despite our full appreciation of  the great services rendered to the         Nation by the Railway Companies during the War&quot;that it has been an advantage         to them which was not contemplated either by the Regulation of the  Forces Act         or by the original Agreement itself.
     In view of the fact that the  effects of the Agreement have exceeded, in considerable  measure, not only the  legal requirements of the  case,  but also the intention and expectation of those who concluded it, we have considered whether we should recommend the revision of the Agreement with a view to the Companies being accorded compensation for loss or injury,  attributable to the operation of the Regulation of the Forces Act, and no more.   We have come to the conclusion, however, that in all the circumstances such a course is impracticable.     We are  satisfied that in  agreeing to pay compensation on the basis of  a guarantee of net receipts, it  was intended by  the Government and  so under- stood by the  Railway Executive Committee that such compensation should cover all loss or injury that might result from Government control.  No suggestion was made,  at the time the original Agreement was concluded, that the  agreed com- pensation was  not exhaustive of the  Government&apos;s liability under the Act of 1871, and so far as  we are  aware no  such question was raised in the course of the subsequent  interpretation and amplification of the original Agreement.     In view, however,  of the suggestion, put forward on behalf of the Railway Companies, that claims  may be preferred against the Government for compensa- tion under the  Act of  1871,  in addition to that provided for  by the guarantee of net receipts, as subsequently interpreted and amplified, we  desire to place on  record our  strong view that it will be improper for any  such  claim to  he accepted, except on the  basis of a complete revision of the existing  agreements, with a view to the total compensation paid or payable to the Companies being restricted to  compensation for loss or injury directly due to the exercise of  the powers conferred by the Act of 1871 on the Secretary of State for War.  We  are of opinion that it would be in the  last degree inequitable that the Companies should enjoy the benefit of  agreements extending so  far  beyond their original purpose, and conferring upon them unique and unforeseen advantages, and in addition receive compensation for other problematical  losses  which it may  be possible to argue are not specifically  covered by the  compensation  paid under those agreements.     6.   The  proviso in the Agreement  as  to Net  Receipts,  under which  the The &quot;Pro- ascertained deficiency was to be reduced by a percentage based on the  decline in J^0i,e the  aggregate  net  receipts of 1914,  as compared  with  those of  1913, was introduced into the  original formula by the Board of  Trade, when the.words limiting the compensation payable under that formula, to compensation for loss or injury attributable to the operation of the Act of 1871, were deleted in view of the  representations of the Railway Executive Committee.  We do not under- stand,  however, that it was considered that  this proviso was  in any way  in substitution of  the limiting words.     It was realised at the time that the year 1913 was the most  favourable year from a revenue point of view that  the  Companies  had ever  had,  and in  the original  draft  of the  agreement put  forward  by the  Board of Trade  the suggestion  had been made that the  net receipts  to be  guaranteed  should be  the  average of  the  net receipts  of the preceding  three  years,  instead o*&apos; those of 1913.   This suggestion was not accepted, owing to the objections of the  Executive Committee to which we have  already referred; the object  of the Government in  introducing the proviso was evidently  to restrict  to some extent  the benefit the  Companies would have enjoyed by  a  guarantee of  the abnormally high net receipts of 1913.     The effect  of this proviso, however, was inconsiderable, and we are unable to conceive that its terms expressed the intention the Government had in view.     The Companies  objected to the &quot; proviso deduction,&quot; rather on the groundthat its application would present accounting difficulties than on its merits, and itwas applied in respect of the first account of the deficiency of net receipts, for  the period  5th August to 31st December, 1914, only.   As from that dale it was waived in consideration of the  Companies agreeing to bear against their own  funds 25per cent, of the cost  of the first War Bonus granted to men in the Conciliation Scheme.  At  the time  it was  thought that these  two considerations  roughlybalanced each other.    7.   The Agreement was published by the Board of Trade on 15th September, Guarantee 1914, the notice stating  : -                                                  to covei&apos;          &quot; The compensation to be paid under this arrangement will cover all fJJo^J,n.      special services such as those in connection with military and naval trans- ment      port rendered to the Government by the Railway Companies concerned, and Traffic.      it will therefore be unnecessary to make any  payments in respect of such      transport on the railways taken over.&quot;                  -            -v   32040                                                              A 4
              The fact that the compensation payable was to  cover payment for Govern-         ment traffic was one of the chief reasons which induced the Government to agree         to this method of assessing compensation.  It was  quite clearly their under-         standing and intention, and indeed we regard it as an inherent condition of the         Agreement itself, that in the event of there being during the period of possession         any  surplus of net receipts over the 1913 basis, the Government would be entitled         to retain such surplus.              The point is probably not of practical importance, as the likelihood of there         being a surplus of net receipts in respect of the whole period of control was always         remote.  We mention it,  however, in view of the fact that the possibility of the         Companies claiming the right to charge for Government traffic and to retain the         surplus receipts, if any, resulting, was a consideration in the mind of the Treasury         when in 1916 they agreed to the Supplementary Clauses to the Agreement incor-         porated in the Pink Book.              The  suggestion that  the Companies were entitled  to  charge for Govern-         ment traffic, and to retain surplus receipts,  does  not appear to  have been put         forward at  any time, as  a  separate issue,  for discussion on its merits.   Sir         Alexander  Butterworth,  who was predominantly concerned with the negotia-         tions on the railway side, has stated  that these Clauses were discussed  and con-         ceded entirely on their merits, and that there was never any serious suggestion,         in the course of the negotiations,  that the  foregoing of any possible  claim the         Railway Companies, or any of them, might have thought they had, to charge for         Government traffic and retain surplus receipts, was put forward as a quid pro quo.              It is nevertheless the case that the Treasury,  when agreeing to  the Supple-         mentary Clauses, required an assurance from the Executive Committee that the         right of the Government  under  the original  Agreement to require free carriage,         and to retain  any surplus receipts realised,  would not in future be questioned.         The matter is obscure, and we have Sir Alexander Butterworth&apos;s statement that         the Companies did not  unduly use an unjustifiable claim as a lever for  obtaining         concessions during the war.   The fact  that the Treasury was concerned to secure         an understanding on the question with  the Executive Committee is significant         of the unsatisfactory position in which the Government was placed.Definition       8.  The first question that  arose after the formulation of the original termsif &quot;&apos;^e*  &quot; 0*&quot; compensation was that of defining the &quot; net receipts &quot; to be guaranteed. There eteip s&quot;  appears to have been some difference of opinion among members of the Railway         Executive Committee as  to whether all the  items in their net revenue accounts         should be included or not.    The Government, however,  acting on the advice  of         Sir William Plender, proposed that  &quot; net receipts &quot; should be defined to mean         the net receipts of the first seven items in Account No. 8 of the First Schedule to          the  Railway Companies  (Accounts and Returns) Act, 1911, excluding the item          &quot; Miscellaneous Receipts (Net).&quot;              The justification for this proposal was that the inclusion of the  item  &quot; Mis-         cellaneous Receipts (Net)  &quot; would lead to accounting difficulties in regard to one of         the  items in  that account,  viz.: &quot; General Interest,&quot; owing  to the  fact that         interest received was treated as a credit to  working expenses, whereas interest         paid was treated as an appropriation from net revenue.  It was further pointed         out  that  the items under &quot; Miscellaneous Receipts (Net) &quot;  were items not cp -         cerned with railway operating  pure and  simple, which  alone would be directly         affected by the consequences of Government control; that they were likely to show          little variation during the period of  possession, and  if anything would decrease.         Their exclusion, therefore, would not militate against the chief principle under-          lying the Agreement, that the  Government were  to  compensate  the Companies          for  loss or injury resulting  from the operation of the Act of 1871, while, in  the          course of events anticipated at  the time, if there was any variation at all in the          ascertained receipts under this head, its exclusion from the guarantee would be to          the  advantage pf the Government.               So far from this expectation having been realised, the exclusion  of &quot; Miscel-          laneous Receipts (Net) &quot; from the guarantee has resulted in considerable benefits          to the Companies.   Not  only have their receipts  from general interest increased          owing to the increase in the Bank Rate, but they have been enabled to enjoy,  in          addition to their guaranteed net receipts, the interest&quot;realised from the invest-          ment of the large sums paid to them currently on account of deferred maintenance.          The increase of the below-the-line* revenue of fourteen principal Companies  up              * The first seven items of Account No. 8.  (&quot;Revenue Receipts and Expenditure&quot;) of  the          Railway Companies statutory  form of accounts are totalled separately from the eighth item.  The          two  totals are commonly designated &quot;above-the-line  revenue&quot; and l&apos;below-the-line revenue&quot;          respectively.  The Government  guarantee  covers  the above-the-line revenue only.  (Vid          Appendix  II.)
Vide Appendix V,to the end of 1919 amounted to approximately  2,000,000*; about two-thirds ofwhich accrued in the year 1919.   It is to be expected, therefore, that the figurewill be considerably enhanced by the end of the period of possession.    The restriction of the Government guarantee to the above-the-line net receipts,although it obviated an initial accounting difficulty in regard to the treatment ofgeneral interest, has led to difficulties in practice owing to the fact that receiptsmay be diverted from Government account without adjustment of the net receiptsbasis.    For instance, if property previously used in  railway working is leased, the rents  subsequently realised are credited, in accordance with the statutory  formof accounts, below-the-line; if property earning revenue in the base year is soldand the proceeds invested, the resulting interest  is enjoyed by the Company asbelow-the-line revenue.    On the other hand, if property, the revenue from which has been received bythe Company below-the-line, is transferred during control to railway working,when the revenue produced  accrnes, above-the-]ine, to Government account, theCompany is, as a rule, entitled to claim interest, in addition to its guaranteed net receipts, under  the  agreement as  to  interest  on capital  expenditure.   (VideChapter IV,  2.)    We are of opinion that the property of which possession was taken in 1914,that was employed in the standard year in the production of the guaranteed net receipts, remains in the possession  of  the Government throughout  the period,and that the revenue earned by such property, in whatever way it may be earned,should be credited to  Government  account.  We understand that  this principlehas been recognised by some Companies, in the case of diversion of revenue fromabove-the-line to below-the-line in consequence of a change in the use to which anasset has been put, and that in a few cases of this kind suitable adjustments havebeen made  in  the Companies&apos; accounts with the  Government,  although the accouting instructions do not provide for such adjustments.  In this class of case,also, there may  conceivably be converse transactions in respect of which Com-panies have not received interest on the capital  value of  the  asset transferred.The matter is not of sufficient importance to  justify any retrospective review ofsuch transactions.    The case of property sold, which  is of  greater importance, is  more con-veniently dealt with in connection with the arrangements as to  interest on capitalexpenditure.   (Vide Chapter IV, ^2.)    9.  A manual of instructions for the preparation of the accounts to be pre- Regulationsented by each controlled Company, for the purpose of arriving at  the amount of of Revenuecompensation payable under the Agreement, was issued to the Companies by the andExpen-Railway Executive Committee on   4th March, 1915.  These  instructions were tjjyjJ*p ^,approved by the Board of Trade, on the advice of Sir William Plender and Mr. 0f arrjvingGurney Fowler, the Consulting Accountants appointed to assist the Government at Netin connection with the Agreement, and were concurred in by the Treasury.       Receipts.    These detailed instructions, known as the Blue Book, are  printed in extensoin Appendix  I.   Their most important  provisions may be  summarised  asfollows:            In determining the amount of  revenue  for the control period, each       Company  should  follow  strictly  the method  which  regulated  the       preparation of its accounts in 1913.           Reserves for estimated  revenue liabilities should be proportionate to      the sums necessary for the half-year ended 31st December,  1913.           Expenditure chargeable for the control  period should be ascertained      as far as it was possible to do so.           The amount charged for the renewal of  permanent  way  and rolling      stock was not to exceed the amount included in the corresponding period of      1.913, except under special circumstances.  (Vide Chapter III.)    It will be seen that no attempt was made to regulate the general expenditureof the Companies. In the circumstances existing at that time it was impracticable for the Board of Trade to institute an effective control of the  details  of railwayexpenditure.  As a  matter  of  fact  the  question was  probably  never  con-sidered; it  was  in keeping  with  the idea underlying the Agreement that no attempt should be made by  the  Government to interfere in any way with the directors or officers of the Companies in the  management of their undertakings,and  that the latter should  be under  an honourable obligation  to  protedt theinterests of the Government.
              This underlying idea was well expressed in a  Circular Letter issued to the          Companies by the Acting-Chairman of the Railway Executive Committee on 13th          August, 1914, from which the following passages are quoted :                      &quot; The Executive Committee are pleased to be able to  announce that                practically all the Companies whose Railways have been taken over by the                Government have agreed to the proposal outlined in my letter of the 8th                instant, under which  the Government guarantee the net receipts of the Rail-                ways collectively.                     &quot; Tt is hardly necessary to point out that the arrangement is one which                in spite of its great convenience both to themselves and the Companies, the                Government could  not have agreed to, had they  not been assured of the                absolute good faith of the Companies,  and had they not felt certain that                they could rely on all officers of the Companies concerned acting loyally up                to the spirit of the arrangement.                    &quot; Broadly speaking, the, idea underlying the arrangement is that the                financial  results to each Company for the period of Government control                shall be the same as if the Railways had remained under the control of the                Companies, and the receipts and expenses of each  Railway had been the                same as they were in the corresponding period of the previous year,  subject                to a deduction proportionate to any falling off in the net receipts disclosed                by the accounts of the Companies as a whole for the  first half-year of 1914.                The result is that,  during the period of Government  control, the advantage                of all economies will  enure to  the benefit of  the Government,  and, corre-                correspondingly, the whole burden of expenditure will fall on them.                    &quot; This state of things obviously imposes an honourable obligation upon                the  Companies  to see that all proper economies are made, and that no                abnormal or unnecessary expenditure is incurred.&quot;              With the exception of expenditure on maintenance a problem with which         we deal elsewhere-it may be supposed that any tendency to slackness  in effecting         economies,  that a guarantee might otherwise have promoted, or any incentive to         extravagant or  unnecessary expenditure, will have been counteracted  by the         consideration that the effects of such  action on the part of the Companies would         persist, to their own disadvantage, after the period of Government possession.  To         a great extent this is true.  Tt is nevertheless the case that a  guarantee is never         productive of efficiency.   During the war the absence of control over general         railway expenditure was probably inevitable, and it would  perhaps be  impossible,         under  any  circumstances, to  establish  a  satisfactory control  over detailed         expenditure.Jnvestiga-       10.  The Blue Book contained  the  following  provision  in regard  to theClaims    certification of the accounts to  be  submitted by the  Companies in  support of         the claim to deficiency of net receipts :                     &quot; The accounts as submitted to the Board  of  Trade should have  a                certificate attached signed by the Chief Accountant, the Auditors or the                Professional Accountants of each Railway  Company,  somewhat  on the                following lines:                           We have examined the Accounts attached, and compared them                      with the books and vouchers of the Company.    We certify  that                      they are  correct and that  they  have  been prepared  strictly  in                      in accordance with the Memorandum of  Instructions  dated March,                      1915, issued by the Railway Executive Committee with the approval                      of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government.&quot;             At the  outset the Government relied on the certificates of the Companies&apos;         Professional Auditors, supplemented by a general examination by  one of the         two Consulting Accountants appointed for the purpose.  These gentlemen acted         in what was practically an  honorary capacity, and  rendered valuable  service         not only in the examination of claims  but in advising  the Government in regard         to  accounting  questions  that  arose  from  time to  time.    The independent         investigation, however, was not, and was not intended to be, an adequate audit.             Tht Railway Executive Committee  set  up an  organisation of Railway         Accountants  to investigate the Companies&apos; claims and ensure their presentation         in a uniform manner and in accordance with  the  Agreements.  The Board of
 Trade and  the Treasury came to recognise and  rely upon  the  protection  thus established, and  in our  opinion the organisation was of  value  not only to the Companies but to the Government.     At the same  time such a system contained inherent defects.  The members of the Railway Executive Committee and still more the members of the Accountants Sub-Committee and the Investigators, found themselves,  even if unconsciously, in a dual position of considerable difficulty.  With the most careful arrangements for the examination of  the claims of  individual Companies by accountants of other Companies, it was inevitable that the Investigators and the members of the Accountants Sub-Committee were to some extent swayed by considerations of railway interests.  In saying  this, we  do not impute the slightest bad faith on the part of the railway accountants concerned, whose public  service we recognise in the fullest degree, but we think that it was psychologically impossible, in the circumstances of the case, that they could have entirely freed themselves of the, unconscious bias, in favour of the railway point of  view, that their experience and interests would promote.     11.-  It may  be convenient, at this point, to summarise the Agreements under  Main their main headings and to indicate briefly their scope.  The provisions of the  Heads more important of the later Agreements, and the circumstances under which they  J^enfsr came to be made, are dealt with  more fully in succeeding  chapters :        1.  Agreement as to Deficiency of Net Receipts.       2.  Arrears of Maintenance.           It was represented by the Railway Executive Committee in 1914 that       the Companies&apos; normal maintenance work was being postponed  in  con-       sequence of their undertaking the manufacture of war material.   The       Government agreed that in these circumstances the cost of the deferred       work, when it came to be executed, should be borne  by the Government.       In 1915 arrangements were made for the discharge of this liability, in the       case of deferred repairs and renewals of permanent  way and rolling stock,       by current payments.           In 1917 these payments were converted into payments on account, the       Government undertaking to pay the balance of the cost when the deferred       work was  carried out.       3.  A bnormal Wear and Tear.           In connection with  Arrears of Maintenance it was agreed that the cost       of making  good abnormal wear and tear should be borne by the Government,       provided the Company  could produce satisfactory evidence in  support of       its claim;  that in the event of abnormal  wear and tear being made good       during the period of control, the expenditure on making  good should be       allowed as a special item,  i.e., it should not be taken  into account in cal-       circulating arrears of normal maintenance; and  that claims in respect  of       abnormal wear and tear not made good during  the period of control would       be considered at the end of the period.       4.  Interest on new Capital Expenditure.          It was agreed in 1916 that the  Companies should be paid interest,  in       addition to the guaranteed net receipts, on capital expenditure  on works,       etc., brought into  use after 31st December, 1912, the revenue from which       was additional to  the revenue of the standard period.  The arrangement       was modified in the Companies&apos;  favour in 1919.       5.  Replacement of Stores.          It was provided in 1916 that in order to secure the Companies  against       loss they might sustain, after the period of control, by reason of their hold-       ing stocks  of stores bought at inflated war prices, a cash payment should       be made at the end of the period, representing the increased cost to  the       Companies of replacing  the stock&apos; of stores held by them in 1914.    In addition to the above, special arrangements were made from time  to timein regard to various matters, including  Compensation  for Lost Ships,, insurance of Railway  Companies&apos;  Properties against Fire, payment  for  railway worksconstructed for Government Departments, and other questions which arose out of changing circumstances and demanded  current solution.  Particulars of these arrangements will be found in the Letters and Documents printed in Appendix I,and in the Minutes of Evidence.   We have not thought it necessary to deal withthem in detail in our Report.

Compensation under the Agreements is paid on claims rendered by theCompanies currently under the following separate heads :-       (a) Account of Net Receipts (or Compensation Claim &quot;), in respect of the             deficiency of net receipts as compared with the net receipts of 1913.             This claim, the preparation of which is  regulated by the Memor-             andum of Instructions (Blue Book) referred to above, covers all the             expenditure incurred by the Companies during the control period in             respect of the accounts the net receipts of which are guaranteed.       (b) A rrears of Maintenance, A bstract A  )       (c) Arrears of Maintenance, Abstract B  j             in respect  of  instalments  payable currently  on  account  of  the             ultimate cost of executing normal maintenance work deferred during             the period of possession.                 In the event of a Company justifying  a  claim in respect of             Abnormal Wear and Tear, the expenditure charged in the Account             of Net Receipts would be allowed as a special item, and not regarded             as normal expenditure for  the purpose of arriving at Arrears of             Maintenance.       (d) Interest on capital expenditure,  in respect of interest on amounts ex-             pended by the Companies on capital assets additional to those in use             throughout the base period.     13.  In  addition to the payments made currently on  these claims, theremay be outstanding liabilities to be settled after the termination of the period ofpossession, under the following heads : -       (a) Arrears  of  maintenance of Permanent  Way  and  Rolling Stock,             in respect of the  balance  of the cost of  executing such arrears of             maintenance,  when the work  is executed and  at  the  prices  then             ruling.       (b) Arrears of maintenance of Plant, etc., other than Permanent Way and             Rolling Stock. Current payments are not made on  account of these             arrears; the Government is  under obligation to meet the whole cost             of executing them, when the work is executed and at the prices then             ruling, less any portion of such cost already borne by the Govern-             ment through the Account of Net Receipts in the form of Transfers             to Provision Funds.       (c) Abnormal Wear and Tear, in respect  of  the  cost of  making  good             abnormal  wear and tear not  made  good during the  period  of             possession.       (d) Replacement  of Stores, in respect of the increased cost of replacing, at             the end of the period of possession, the stocks of stores held by the             Companies in 1914.     We  are  informed that claims  may also be preferred by  the Companies inrespect of additional compensation to which they regard  themselves as entitled under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, and the Ministry of Transport Act,1919.     14.  The Agreement of 1914 guaranteed the controlled Railway Companies,collectively, the aggregate net receipts, shown in the Published Accounts of 1913,of the first seven items of Account No. 8 of the Statutory Account, less a percentagededuction.  The subsequent Agreements were intended to be in the nature of inter-interpretations and amplifications of the original Agreement, designed to carry out the underlying purpose of that Agreement in changing circumstances.     The underlying purpose of the original Agreement was that while the Com-panies were under obligation to exercise  all possible economies,  and  prevent allunnecessary expenditure, the financial results to each Company during the periodof possession should be  the same as they would have been had the undertakingsremained under the control of the Companies and the receipts and expenses of eachrailway had been the same as they were in the corresponding period of the previous year.     In pursuance of this- intention special arrangements were subsequently made,under which the Government accepted liability, in addition to the guaranteed net receipts,  for abnormal expenditure rendered necessary by their requirements, e.g.,in respect of abnormal wear and tear due to Government traffic, and sidings, etc,,specially constructed for Government Departments.
                             CHAPTER  111.                            MAINTENANCE.    (The detailed arrangements regarding Maintenance are summarised in                          Appendices A and B.)    1.   The Memorandum of Instructions to Railway Companies for the prepare- Excessration of the accounts to be presented by each controlled Company, to arrive at Mamton-the amount of compensation payable under the Agreement, issued by the Railway ance&apos;Executive Committee on 4th  March, 1915,  and known as the  Blue Book, con-tained the following clauses relating to  maintenance:       &quot; Expenditure from 5th August, 1914.          4. The expenditure chargeable for  the control period must be ascer-      tained as far as it is possible to do so,  with  the proviso  that the amount      charged for the renewal of permanent way and rolling stock is not to exceed      the amount included in the corresponding period of 1913,  except under      special circumstances such  as additions   to the length.  of  line  opened.      additions to  rolling stock in service or  an increase in the cost of renewal      work carried  out during the period resulting from increased price of labour      and materials.&quot;                                 M.

(c) In determining the amount of revenue expenditure for the control      period each Company must follow strictly the method which regulated the      preparation of the accounts in 1913,  and provisions to be made should be      proportionate to the sums necessary for the half-year ended 31st December,      1913.  Particularly should this principle be observed in setting up reserves      for  depreciation  or provisions for maintenance of locomotives,  carriages      and wagons,  permanent way, bridges, stations, etc.&quot;                                      J/.    M.         JA.                                 &quot;/V&quot;    TV    *7v     TT    Tv       &quot; Arrears of Maintenance  Work.           (e)  In the event of the Companies being of opinion that, arrears of      normal maintenance work  have arisen  during  the control  period,  His      Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken  to consider on  their merits any       representations submitted  to them, and,  if necessary,  a statement should       be prepared  at the end of the control period of any liabilities of this nature       not included in the accounts prepared currently.   (No  such statement will       be required in cases where provision is  made for maintenance by carrying       definite sums to a special fund in anticipation of actual expenditure.)&quot;     These clauses definitely restricted  the charges to be included in the Compen- sation Accounts in respect of renewals, reserves for depreciation and provisions for maintenance, but imposed no  such rigid limitation in regard to repairs.   It is desirable to indicate that there were adequate  reasons for treating repairs and other maintenance  charges differently  in the Blue Book, in view of the fact that it is now claimed  that  in the absence of specific  regulation to the contrary in the accounting instructions,  the  Companies are at large as regards expenditure on repairs, although, as will be shown hereafter, it was clearly understood from the commencement of the period of possession that normal maintenance, including repairs, was not to be exceeded except under abnormal circumstancs. of which the onus of  proof was upon the Companies.     It has  already been stated  that no attempt was made  by the Government to regulate the normal  day to day expenditure of the Companies,  or to interfere in any way with their Directors and  Officers in the management of the under- takings.   The Companies  were under an  honourable obligation  to  prevent abnormal and unnecessary expenditure and to secure  all proper  economies.  If this obligation was fulfilled, the extent  of  the expenditure  on repairs to be undertaken by the Companies during  the period of possession was no doubt regarded  as being dependent on circumstances over which  the  Companies  had no direct control; and if normal conditions continued, the expenditure on repairs would not exceed  the normal expenditure.  In. these circumstances it  was there-  fore iii conformity with the general scheme that a rigid limit should not be set  to the charges to be  included  in the  Compensation Accounts in respect of  repairs.   In any case  it was impracticable to  limit repairs expenditure during
 the short period contemplated when the first accounting instructions were under preparation.     The case of renewals, however, was different.  Expenditure on renewals is capable of  being estimated and  equalised over a period of years, and it is the practice of  most  Companies to deal with their renewals expenditure in that way. In the absence of regulation it would have been possible for Companies to antici- pate renewals,, and so charge the Government with the cost of work that in the normal course would be performed at the Company&apos;s own expense after the period of possession.  While it might be anticipated that no Company would deliberately take this course,  it was obviously satisfactory, in order to prevent any possibility of misunderstanding or dispute, that the rights of the Companies in a matter of this kind, which was capable of  regulation, should be  placed beyond  doubt in the accounting instructions.     For similar  reasons  it was  desirable  that reserves for depreciation  and provisions for  maintenance should be regulated.  The amounts periodically set aside  under these  heads have no close  relation to immediate  circumstances; subject to the current revenue position they are within the control and discretion of the Directors of the Companies.  Tt would clearly have been unsatisfactory to both parties if such charges had been left unregulated.     While  war conditions lasted, there was little need for a close definition of the arrangement  in regard to  the limitation of normal maintenance expenditure, owing to  the fact that the prevailing shortage of labour and materials imposed a  physical limitation on the amount of maintenance work that could be under- taken.  In the circumstances obtaining and contemplated at the time, the likelihood of any Company being able, during the period of possession, to perform main- tenance work in excess of the  normal was remote, and it does not appear to have occurred to the Board of Trade to provide for such a contingency in the accounting instructions.     As a consequence of  the  extension of control for two years after the war, conditions have arisen in which the Companies have been able to undertake main- tenance work on a large  scale, and as a result a number of Companies have already expended on repairs to rolling stock, after making up the whole of the arrears accumulated during  the  war,  considerable amounts  in  excess  of their 1913 quantum of repairs in that Abstract.     We are  of opinion that to charge such excess repairs to Government is contrary to the underlying&apos;principle of the original Agreement.   One of the first points to which attention was directed by the Board of Trade after the formula for the ascertainment of  the compensation payable  to  the Companies had been settled, in August,  1914, was the possibility that Companies might take advantage of the position, to repair and renew their  plant and. equipment to an abnormal extent, and  so  improve  their  undertakings  at the expense of the  State.  The President of the Board of Trade personally  represented  this danger to  the Railway Executive Committee, who addressed him in the following terms on the 9th August,  1914:-          &quot; We understand from the statements you made to us to-day that there       is some apprehension on the part of the  advisers of the Government that       advantage  may be taken by some  Companies of the settlement provisionally       come  to  with the Government  as to the basis  of  compensation under       Section 16  of the Regulation of Forces Act, 1871, to spend abnormal sums       out of revenue on the maintenance and renewal of their lines and  stock.          &quot; I have to say that while the Executive Committee cannot believe that       any Company would be capable of acting in such a manner, they have from      the first regarded it as an obligation of honour to protect the Government       against the possibility  of such an  event, and  they had before your visit       already taken steps to safeguard the  position of ihe Government in this       respect/&apos;    On the  13th August, the Executive Committee  issued to the controlled companies a Circular Letter containing the following passage :           &quot; Then, again, questions may arise as to the amount to be expended      on the maintenance and  renewal of way and works, or rolling stock. Under      these heads it will not be open to a Company to  include in  its working      expenses any greater sum than is required to maintain its works and plant      in an  efficient condition, including due allowance for renewals, and if the      expenditure of any  Company upon any item of maintenance exceeds the      corresponding figure in the previous year, the Government will, no doubt,
      in the absence of special justification, expect it to be shown that the addi-      tional expenditure was rendered necessary by their requirements, or by the      exceptional character or quantity of the traffic  carried during the period      of Government control.  This  point has  been  definitely raised by the      Treasury, and the Executive Committee have had no hesitation in giving      an assurance, on behalf of all the Companies taken over, that no unfair      advantage will be taken of the present situation in connection  with  the      renewal of works or plant.&quot;    In view of this clear assurance given by the Railway Executive Committeeto the President of the Board of Trade, and conveyed to the Railway Companies,which, it will be observed referred to  maintenance expenditure generally, and made no exception in the case of repairs, we are of opinion that it was a conditionunderlying  the original  Agreement that  the  Companies&apos; maintenance  chargesduring the  period of possession, under all  Abstracts, including both repairs andrenewals, should be limited to the  1913 quantum, except in special circumstances,of which the onus of proof is upon the Companies.    The object the  parties had in view, in formulating the original Agreement,was to guarantee to the  Companies their normal net receipts.   &quot; Normal  net receipts &quot; have been defined as the net receipts of 1913, and the Companies havethereby been guaranteed, throughout the war, the net receipts of the most favour-able year in their history, a year in which there can be little doubt that abnormalsums were  spent and provided on  account of  maintenance.   In these  circum-stances we are of opinion that the standardisation of the 1913 quantum of main-tenance as a maximum for normal maintenance during  the period of possession isto accord the Companies  generous treatment.   It is  true that abnormal main-tenance  charges in  1913 reduced  pro tanto  the guaranteed standard  of  net receipts.   The Companies would,  however, receive  a  considerable benefit fromany such abnormal charges in 1913, in so far as corresponding expenditure duringthe period of control may be allowed on the basis of  increased prices.    It may be contended that it is impossible for Railway Companies to  restricttheir maintenance expenditure to a particular figure, owing  to the fact  that, inorder to carry out their statutory obligation to keep their undertakings maintained at a standard compatible with public safety, they may be under the necessity in any.particular period, of performing maintenance work in excess of normal.   For thisreason, it would certainly be impracticable rigidly to restrict a  Company&apos;s main-tenance expenditure in respect of a particular short period.  The standardisation of a normal year&apos;s  maintenance  over a period  of seven years,  however, should suffice to enable the Companies to meet any variations in the regularity  of their normal maintenance that may have, arisen during the period.    In view of the clearly expressed conditions of the original Agreement, we areunable to admit the contention that the Companies are at large as regards  repairs,and we are of the, opinion, based on the evident intention of  the parties  in 1914,and on the view we have formed of  the equities of the case, that the Companies haveno reasonable claim to charge against the Government,  in respect of normal main-tenance during the. period of possession, any sum in excess of  their 1913 quantumof maintenance, i.e., an amount, proportionate to the period, corresponding to theamount charged against working expenses in their accounts for the year 1913, with appropriate additions in respect of the  increases, as  compared with that  year, inthe, cost of labour and materials and in respect of the  maintenance of additional capital assets  subsequently brought into use.   Any  expenditure in excess of anamount so calculated should be regarded as abnormal maintenance, which may be chargeable against the Government, in whole or in part, under the Agreement asto Abnormal Wear and Tear.    We understand there is no difference of opinion as to the liability of the Com-panies themselves to bear the 1913 cost  of any excess renewals performed, but bythe application of  accounting methods adopted when the possibility of excessrenewals arising was not contemplated,  it has  come about that charges in respectof the additional cost of excess renewals have recently been included in the Accountof Net Receipts and the question of disallowing such charges has been under theconsideration of the Government Accountant  and  the Ministry  of Transport.Whatever may be the accounting  questions involved  in the disallowance  of these items, we are satisfied that there is no justification for charges against the  Govern-ment  in respect of excess renewals, unless they represent  the  making  good of abnormal wear and tear due to Government control.
    A number of Companies are already in excess in Abstract B that is to say,have not only overtaken all the. arrears of maintenance of rolling stock accumulatedduring the War, but have carried out, and charged to the Government, a greaterquantity of maintenance work than is represented by their expenditure and provi-sion in 1913, standardised, with due allowance  for increasing prices,  over theperiod of control.  We are informed that a number of these Companies are con-tinuing to incur, under the heading of repairs to rolling stock (which includespartial renewals), expenditure largely in excess of their 1913 expenditure, equatedto current prices.    We recommend,       that charges for maintenance in excess of the 1913 quantum appearing in      the Companies&apos; claims now under  examination,  or hereafter submitted,      should not be allowed;      that Companies to which payments in respect of such excess charges have      already been made should refund the amount of the excess;      that any Company claiming to have  incurred expenditure on making good      abnormal wear  and tear should substantiate its claim in  accordance with      the conditions hereafter indicated (Chapter III, 5 4).Current        %  In October,  1914, the Railway Executive Committee represented to theonAccount -^oar(* 0^ r^m^&amp; that in consequence of locomotive and wagon shops having been of Arrears P^ced. at the disposal of the War Office for the manufacture of stretchers andof Main-   general service wagons, renewals and repairs to railway plant, the cost of whichtenance.   would under the Agreement have been currently borne by the Government, were         being postponed; it might therefore be necessary sooner or later to include in the         Companies&apos; claims against the Government sums to cover the cost of the deferred         work which would have to be overtaken.              The following clause, in which the liability of the Government to make good         arrears of  maintenance work is admitted in general terms, was included in the         first Memorandum  of instructions for  the  preparation  of claims under  the         Agreement (Blue Book), issued to the Companies in March, 1915.               &quot; Arrears of Maintenance Work.                    (e) In the event  of the Companies being of  opinion that arrears of               normal maintenance  work have arisen  during the  control  period,  His               Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken  to consider  on their merits any               representations submitted to them; and,  if necessary, a statement should               be prepared at the end of the control period of any liabilities of this nature               not included in the accounts prepared currently.  (No  such statement will               be required in cases where provision is made for maintenance by carrying               definite sums to a special fund in anticipation of expenditure.)&quot;              In the summer of 1915 the Railway Executive Committee submitted that in         view of the amount  of war manufactures being undertaken by  the Committee         it was inexpedient that the method of dealing with arrears of maintenance should         be left in abeyance until the end of the control period, and proposed that the         amount of the arrears should be estimated and brought into account  month by         month.  It  was suggested by the Executive  Committee that the expenditure of         1913 might fairly be taken as the basis of calculation, and  that the amount to         be charged  should be the  amount by which the 1914-1915 expenditure, reduced to         1913 prices, should fall short of the 1913 expenditure, plus an addition of 12J per         cent, up to 31st December, 1915, in respect of the increase in prices as  compared         with 1913.             After consulting the Government Accountant as to the propriety of. the pro-         posed percentage addition, the  Board of Trade agreed, in August, 1915,  that         payments,&apos; calculated  in the manner suggested, should be made currently in respect         of arrears  of repair and renewal of rolling stock.   In September,  1915, the         arrangement was extended to arrears of repair  and renewal  of permanent way,         the same percentage  addition being  allowed in respect of the period to  31st         December, 1915. -             The payments made  to the Companies under this arrangement Were final         transactions, and no  liability remained with the Government in respect of the         ultimate cost of carrying out  the deferred work.  In such circumstances, the         contingent risks being borne by the  Companies, it was reasonable that current         payments should be made and that the Companies  should enjoy the interest realised         from the investment of the funds accumulated.
    In 1917, however, when the question arose of fixing a new percentage additionto apply in respect of the year 1916, the Railway Executive Committee suggestedthat instead of final payments being made at a rate based on the prices prevailing in the year in which the arrears arose, which might be greater or less than those at which the deferred work would eventually be executed, the payments should betreated as payments on account, and a final settlement made when the work came to be carried out.    Agreement on this basis was ultimately reached in June, 1917, and payments on account have been made, at 115 per cent, of 1913 prices, in respect of all arrearsaccrued since the commencement of the period of possession.    It would clearly have been open to the Government, in agreeing to this changeof plan, to cease making payments to the Companies currently in respect of arrears of maintenance.   The Companies were now relieved of all liability for the cost ofmaking good deferred work, and there was no.reason why they should realise theinterest on the accumulated funds.   The point  was considered by the Treasury,.and the decision of that Department was conveyed to the Railway Executive Com-mittee in the following terms :            &quot; 6.  For obvious reasons My Lords would have preferred to make no      further payments on account,  deferring settlement until the  Companies      were themselves called upon to defray the  expenditure.  The Companies      have no alternative but to  invest  the money paid to them on account; and      the interest on such investments is credited to a General Interest Account       &apos; below-the-line &apos; and not to Revenue, so as to reduce the compensation pay-      able under the guarantee.           &quot; 7.  My Lords are, however, satisfied that the claim of the Companies        *      to this interest cannot be lightly dismissed.  While it is true that increased      running expenses, due to postponement of repairs, etc.,  fall  upon the Ex-      chequer through the^operation of the Guarantee, the increased amount of      repairs, due to progressive deterioration and employment of rolling stock      which would, normally, have been scrapped, falls upon the Companies, the      compensation for arrears being based upon the 1913 standard.  Further,      some appreciable  period must necessarily  elapse between the time that       Companies  actually meet  their current  payments for  working expenses       or special works for Government Departments and the time they receive       repayment  (in the monthly advance of compensation or otherwise);  and       the cost of  providing working capital during that interval is not charge-      able against the Exchequer.           8.   After full consideration My Lords feel it would be  inequitable,       if not indeed impolitic, to cease making payments on account of arrears.&quot;     This decision  was probably a reasonable  one  in  the  light of the circum-stances obtaining  and contemplated at  the time,  particularly having regard tothe fact that at that date the annual receipts  under the head  of &quot; general interest &quot;, included below-the-line,  did not exceed  the amount enjoyed by theRailway Companies in the year  1913.  From that date, however,  the aggregateannual receipts from  General Interest  tended rapidly to increase,  and we areof  opinion that the advantage to the Companies from the decision has in conse-quence  more than offset the obligations it was designed to meet, and has been asubstantial concession  in addition to the guaranteed net receipts.     In all the circumstances we  do not propose any retrospective adjustment ofthe arrangement.   We are of opinion, however, that any justification for currentpayments on account of arrears of repairs has long ceased to exist,  and that such payments should be discontinued.     Furthermore, we are unable to find any sufficient reason for continuing pay-ments to the Companies, in respect of the additional cost of making good arrears of  maintenance, while they are in possession  of  large funds, approximating to 40,000,000, already paid to them on account of the  Governments liability.     We accordingly recommend that the Companies should utilise the fundsalready paid  to them on account of arrears of maintenance, in defraying thewhole cost of  overtaking deferred work,  before receiving  further payments onaccount of the additional cost of arrears overtaken.    3.   The statement has  repeatedly been made that it was  an underlying Outstand-principle of the original Agreement that the Railway Companies&apos; undertakings ins Lia-should be handed back to them at the end of the period of possession in the same billty jncondition as they were in at the commencement.                                Arrears0   32046                                                                B    of Main-                                                                           tenance.
    It is a reasonable inference from the original Agreement that the companies were thereby guaranteed their standard net receipts in full, over  and above theexpenditure they would themselves have incurred, in the absence of government control, and any abnormal expenditure to which they might be put in meetingthe special requirements of the Government.  We can find nothing, in the cir-cumstances surrounding the negotiation of the original Agreement, to support the contention that the Government  undertook an obligation to meet expenditureon maintenance that in the absence of Government control the Companies wouldnot have been able to carry out, or to protect the Companies against any declinein the condition  of their undertakings that might  result  from  circumstances affecting Industry as a whole.    The Companies have contended that &quot;......the broad principle underlying the arrangements  between  the  Government and the Railway  Com-panies is that the Railways shall bp maintained at the cost of  the government during the period of control, and handed over to the Companies at the end of that-period in the same condition physically, so far as possible, as they  were in at thecommencement neither better nor worse......&quot;  We cannot find thatthe Government has at any time admitted that such an obligation was an inherentterm of the  original  Agreement, nor do we. think that such an  obligation, withall its possible implications, ought to be admitted.    It may  be that the carrying out of the  Agreement will result in the under-takings being brought to their 1914 standard of maintenance and efficiency  with-out any diminution of the net receipts guaranteed to the Companies, but it would obviously be quite impracticable to ascertain whether the condition of the under-takings was the same,  or even substantially the same, at  the beginning and endof control, and it does not appear that such a criterion could have been intendedas a test of the fulfilment of the Governments obligation.  It certainly would beimpossible to apply such a test in regard to the physical maintenance of the under-takings.    The obligation entered into by the Government was to secure  to the  Com-panies,  for the period of possession, a definite quantum of net receipts over and above the charges properly debitable, in respect of the period, to certain of theiraccounts.  In regard  to maintenance,  this  was an obligation  to  bear current expenditure  necessarily incurred,  and  provisions   properly  made,  and  inso far as normal repair and renewal work, deferred during the period, was sub-sequently executed, to meet the cost of such work, when executed, less any portionof such cost already provided.    When it was  decided that payments  should  be  made  to the Companies,currently, on account of the Governments liability to meet the  cost of deferredmaintenance subsequently made good, it was necessary to provide a means where-by to measure the  quantity of work deferred.  The  Arrears  of  MaintenanceFormula was devised for this purpose, and current payments have been made onthe basis of  the :&apos; arrears &quot; shown by this  measure.    It seems to have been assumed that the Government is under liability to meet,after the period of possession,  the cost cf executing the quantum of maintenance work shown by the formula as being in arrear at the end of  the period, and&apos; thesuggestion has been made on behalf of the Railway Companies that a year fromthe termination of control would be a convenient time at which  to liquidate thisliability.    The Government does not  appear to  have accepted this suggestion,  or tohave admitted at any time that their liability extended beyond  meeting the costof deferred works requiring to be executed,  when  they come to  be executed.Indeed,  the  admission of further  liability would  conflict with  the  expressprinciple of the original Agreement that any economies effected during the periodof possession would enure to the  benefit of the Government.    The  arrears  remaining  on  30th  September,   1920,   are  estimated  at- 36,600,000, on the basis of  1913 prices.  Payments have been made currently,on account of the ultimate cost of carrying out the deferred work, amountingapproximately to  42,000,000. The outstanding liability, on the basis of thesefigures, is estimated at  68,000,000, if executed at current prices.    It may beassumed that no further arrears will arise during the remainder of the controlperiod, and that the ascertained arrears at 30th September, 1920, represent thelimit  of the Governments possible outstanding liability.    It  appears  from  Tables which  have  been prepared  for. us  (Appendix  C)that this outstanding liability represents  an average  annual deferment, duringthe 5 years 1914-1919,  of 21*2 per cent, of a normal yeats maintenance in thecase of Abstract A, and 15&apos;8 per cent, in the case of Abstract B, or 18&apos;2 per cent.for the two Abstracts taken together; while  if similar calculations be  made
on the basis of each Company&apos;s actual expenditure in 1913 eliminating transfersto and from  provision funds and proportionate reductions be effected in  theascertained arrears,  it will  be found that the average annual  deferment, over five years, represented by the outstanding liability (thus adjusted), is Abstract A,19 per cent; Abstract B, 12 per cent.; total, 15 per cent.    If allowance be  made for the  artificial inflation of the ascertained arrears,indicated in Appendix B, these percentages will be still further reduced.    It would therefore appear that if the Companies be regarded as a whole, thequantum of deferred work  for which payment has  not already been  made is a relatively small proportion of the Companies&apos; normal annual maintenance.  this proportion varies as between  individual Companies, but in the case of the majorityof Companies it is below the  average of the Companies as a whole.    It will be evident that in the circumstances under which the Companies were working  during the War a considerable amount of the normal maintenance work that  was not undertaken was of a kind that, having been deferred, wall neverrequire to be carried  out.    Shortly after the outbreak of war, train services were cut down, and as time went on  further curtailments took  place, both in passenger services and in goods and mineral traffic.   At the same time reductions were effected  in the speeds oftrains.  The consequent saving in wear and  tear of  plant and equipment caused a reduction in normal maintenance  expenditure, which, though it will never haveto be made good, is an  element of the ascertained arrears.    There can  be no  doubt that,  owing to shortage of labour and  materials,refinements were cut down to a minimum, and only immediately essential workscarried out.   Much of the less important work that was deferred need not now becarried out.   This ieduction of ordinary maintenance chiefly affected the comfortof the railway employees and the public; in no sense can it be held to have detri-mentally affected the property of the undertakings.   The money that was not spent in the ordinary  cycle  of operations,  and does not now require to be spent, has been saved.   This  saving should accrue to the Government.  Through the operation ofthe Arrears of  Maintenance Formula it is included in the  ascertained arrears.    Under the stress of war  conditions, the ordinary maintenance practice of theCompanies, with its undoubted tendency to err on the side of safety, had to give way to the necessity of taking the utmost out of plant and equipment.   A longerlife was demanded from railway property; cleaning of track, roadways and yards,cutting of grass slopes, maintaining  fences, and many other similar classes ofwork, were no doubt cut down to  a minimum.  In so far as the result was  dis-comfort to the public, it was patiently borne; in so far as it involved a reductionin the standard of safety, the financial risks were the burden of the Government.    Many  branches and stations throughout  the  country were closed,   and reduction in  maintenance expenditure resulted, which to a considerable extentdoes not now require to be made good.    All  such reduction of  normal maintenance, however, has operated  to swellthe ascertained arrears, and the Companies  have received payments, throughoutthe control period, at 115 per cent, of the 1913 cost of carrying it out.   To theextent to which such arrears do not  require to be carried out, the  payments arein excess of the Governments liability.    We  recognise that the  amount of deferred work that will not require to becarried out  is greater  in the case of the maintenance of Permanent Way  and auxiliary works than in  that of Rolling Stock, and that there are circumstances -such as the alleged reduced efficiency of labour, and the cost  of increased  anduneconomic  repairs  resulting from  the  postponement of  normal  maintenance work of which account is  not taken in the Arrears of Maintenance Formula,which, to this  extent,  is disadvantageous to the Companies.  It would appear,however, that the artificial arrears  produced by the formulae  more than offsetany  understatement of  arrears due to these  circumstances,  and  it  must beremembered  that it  was to provide, inter  alia, for the cost of increased  and.uneconomic repairs that the Government agreed,  in  1917, to the retention by theCompanies of interest on amounts paid currently on account of Arrears of Main-tenance.     It is obviously impossible for  this Gommittee to assess the amount that  maybe due to or  from any Company in respect of Arrears of Maintenance after allthese various considerations have been taken into account, and we doubt whether an accurate assessment is practicable at this date.   The matter would appear tobe essentially one for compromise.    32046                                                              B 2
    We are of opinion, however, that in view of-      (a)  the relatively small proportion of normal  maintenance work repre-            sented by the outstanding liability in respect of the arrears ascer-            tained by the formulae;      (b)  the fact that the ascertained arrears appears to be to a considerable            extent artificially inflated;      (c)  the fact that much normal maintenance work was deferred during the            war and will not now require to be carried out,there  are strong primd facie  reasons for  thinking that many of the  companies have already been paid more  than  sufficient to enable them to meet the deferredexpenditure that will  have to be made good.    We therefore recommend that no further payments be made in respect of thefinancial arrears shown by the formulas, except to the extent to which it may bepossible for Companies to show that the amounts already paid to  them  are insufficient to provide for  the making good of physical arrears that may actuallyrequire to be overtaken.Abnormal       4.  The underlying  object of  the  Agreement of August,  1914, was  toWear ami  guarantee the Companies their &quot; normal net receipts.&quot;  That this  was the inten-   &apos;      tion of the Railway Executive Committee, to which the Government assented, is         clearly indicated in the memorandum^ in which the former supported their pro-         posed  amendment  of  the original  draft formula  put forward by the Board  of         Trade.              &quot;  Normal net  receipts &quot; was immediately defined as the net receipts of  1913         (less a deduction based on the percentage decline in net receipts shown by the         accounts of 1914), and it was generally understood by the parties that the &quot; normal         net receipts &quot; were to be based on normal expenditure, and that normal expendi-         ture was not in ordinary circumstances to exceed  1913  expenditure.              In the Circular Letter issued  by the Railway Executive Committee on  13th         August, 1914,, already quoted, the  Companies were informed that                    &quot; .... If the expenditure of any company upon any item of main-                tenance exceeds the corresponding figure in the previous year, the Govern-                ment will, no doubt, in the absence of special justification, expect it to  be                shown that the additional  expenditure was rendered necessary by their                requirements or  by  the exceptional  character or quantity of  the traffic                carried during the period of Government  control.   This point has  been                definitely raised by the Treasury.  .   .  .&quot;              In agreeing to the first Memorandum of Instructions for the preparation  of         claims to arrears of maintenance, Abstracts A. and B. (Yellow Book, issued  25th         January, 1916), the Government formally admitted their liability, in respect  of         normal maintenance,  for  the 1913 quantum of maintenance, whether executed         during or after the period of control, and in addition undertook to pay the cost         of making good any  abnormal wear and tear to  which the permanent way  or         rolling stock of a  Company might be proved to have been  subjected  during the         control period.              The clauses in the accounting instructions relating  to abnormal wear and         tear are as follows :               &apos;&apos; A additional  Expenditure for A bnormal Wear and Tear.                (/) Any amount included in the expenditure, representing additional costs                      incurred as the result of abnormal wear and tear to which the per-                      manent way or rolling  stock of a Company has been subjected                      during the control period, should be deducted t from such expendi-                      ture.  Owing to the varying circumstances of the  Companies,  it is                      impossible to  stereotype a method for arriving at the deductions                      referred to in  this paragraph.   Each Company, therefore,  who                      makes such  a deduction will be  required  to produce  sufficient                      evidence, accompanied by a report from the Chief  Executive Officer                      concerned, to  satisfy the Government Auditor that  the abnormal                    . * wear and tear so deducted has taken  place, and that the expenditure                      has been incurred during the control period in making the same                      good.&quot;             * Appendix 1, p. 5, Document 4, enclosure,             t i.e. deducted from the expenditure of the year, before  comparison with  1913 expenditure         for the  purpose of arriving at arrears.
                             CHAPTER IV.         SUPPLEMENTARY CLAUSES TO THE AGREEMENT.    1.   In the autumn of 1915 the Railway Executive Committee raised a number General.of questions, not provided for by the terms of the original Agreement, which called for settlement in view of the prospect, then realised, that the period of the war would be more protracted than had been anticipated.    After considerable discussion between the Railway Executive Committee andthe  Treasury, agreement  was reached  in  regard to a number of the questions raised, and the terms agreed upon were recorded in a document entitled, &quot; Supple-mentary Clauses to A greement with His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;  This document was issued to the Companies by the Executive Committee on 14th November, 1916,and is known as the Pink Book.  (Vide Appendix I, p. 89.)    The Supplementary Clauses dealt with the following matters :         I.  Capital Expenditure.        II.  Stores.                 These items, which were the most important, form the subject            of g g 2 and 3 of this Chapter.       III.  A llowances to Dependants of Men serving with IIis Majesty&apos;s Forces.                 It was provided that as  from the commencement  of control the             cost of such allowances, made in accordance with instructions issued,             should be borne by the Government.       IV.  Damage to Railway Property by Bombardment or Hostile Aircraft.                 The Government agreed to bear the cost of making good such             damage  (except in the case of  property  the  rent of  which was            enjoyed by the Company below-the-line), whether made good during             or after control, and to indemnify the  Company in respect of (above-             the-line) property held under lease or agreement.   It was provided          -   that any insurance premiums already  paid by the Companies should             be borne by the Government, and that the Companies  should give             credit to the Government for any sums received under  policies of             insurance.                              &quot;^&quot;6md7l47/19197                       n ,   32046                                                            P 3    &quot; A bnormal Wear and Tear.      7.  It should be noted that the claims to be made under these Instructions            do not take into account the abnormal wear and tear to which the            permanent way and rolling stock of certain Companies may have            been subjected during the control period, so far as such abnormal            wear and tear has not been made good during that period,  and that            any  Company who is in a position to substantiate a claim under            this  head  should make its claim independently of the claims sub-            mitted for arrears of work.&quot;    The  documents are indefinite as  to the nature of  the evidence to be adducedin support of claims in respect of Abnormal Wear and Tear, and we understandthat no claim has yet been passed.   The outstanding liability has been estimated^by the Government Accountants at  40,000,000, but we are informed  by themthat this is an estimate on which little reliance should  be placed.    We  recommend that any claims that may  be put forward in respect of abnormal Wear and Tear  should be substantiated on the following grounds:       (a) that the abnormal  wear  and  tear has been  due to  Government user of            the Company&apos;s  undertaking;      (b) that the making good of the  abnormal wear and tear formiijg the&apos;            subject of the claim has  not  been counterbalanced by  reduced            maintenance expenditure  owing to  subnormal  wear and  tear of            other portions of the Company&apos;s  undertaking in the same or another            accounting period;      (c) that the amounts received  or receivable by  the Company in respect of            normal maintenance are insufficient to provide for the making good            of the abnormal wear and  tear forming the subject of the claim,            in addition to normal maintenance.    In the event of any claim in respect of abnormal wear and tear being admitted,the cost of making good should be discounted by the! present value of any saving inrepairs and  renewals that may result from the earlier renewal of the asset, andall betterment should, of course, be excluded.
 V. Charges for Services rendered by Railway Companies to the Govern-      ment.          We have already referred to the general bearing, on the negotia-      tion of these Supplementary Clauses, of the question of payment      for Government  traffic  and  the  disposal  of  surplus  receipts.      (Chapter II,  $7.)          This Clause incorporated a Schedule specifying the particular      classes of traffic in respect of which direct cash payments should,      and should not, be made to the  Companies by Government Depart-      ments.  The  provision for cash payments in  certain cases did not      conflict with  the right of the Government to  free carriage, and to      the retention of surplus receipts; the objects in  view were chiefly      to prevent the extravagant use of railway  services by Government      Departments and to secure that payment should be made for below -      the-line services and  accommodation which  were not covered by      the guarantee.VI Adjustment of Accounts.          This Clause provided that each Company should give an under-      taking to repay to the Government any sums which, on  a  final      settlement of the accounts of  any period  ending  31st  December,      might be found to have been received or retained in excess of the      amounts due, together with interest at 5 per cent, from the 1st March      following the close  of  such period.  This provision was rendered      necessary by  the fact  that payments were made  on monthly state-      ments, rendered by the  Companies, which were not, as  a  rule,      verified, the final settlement being made after examination of annual      accounts.Interest on     2.  Towards the end of 1015 the Railway Executive Committee representedCapital Ex-  to ^he Treasury that owing to the prolongation of the period of control, manypen i nre.  Qompanies were suffering hardship, by reason of the fact that the Agreement          contained no provision regarding Capital Expenditure incurred by the Companies          during the period.   It was pointed out that the  Government were benefiting to          the extent of any additional revenue or saving resulting from such expenditure,          while the interest or dividend  on the capital raised  was a charge upon the          Companies.             It. would have been in accordance with the spirit of the original Agreement          that such additional revenue or saving should be excluded from the calculation          of net receipts during the period of control, on the ground that it was not included          in the accounts of the standard year.   This was not practicable, however, and the          alternative suggestion was made by  the Railway  Executive Committee that, the          position  should be met by the payment to  the Companies, in addition to the          guaranteed net receipts, of interest, at an agreed rate, and accruing  from appro-          priate dates, on capital expenditure on certain classes of plant  and equipment.             Agreement on this  basis was eventually  reached, and clauses recording the          arrangement agreed upon were incorporated in the Pink Book.             The  main features of the arrangement were  as follows :                (1) Interest to be allowed upon all sums,  properly chargeable  to capital                     and  actually so charged, expended upon                           (a) works (including land), rolling stock and plant brought into                                use since 31st December,  1912;                          (b) mineral support acquired since 31st December, 1912, in con-                                nection with lines in use  during the period of control.               (2) Interest to be at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum for the whole period                     of control.               (3) Interest to accrue from the date on which the works, etc.,  are brought                     into use, or from 5th August, 1914, in the case of works brought into                     use before that date, appropriate adjustments being made in respect                     or works brought into use during the standard  year (1913) which                     affected the net receipts during  a  portion of that year.             In May, 1919, the Railway Executive Committee represented  that while new         capital expenditure  on  a considerable&apos; scale  was  necessary in connection with         post-war. reconstruction, the  Companies felt  themselves unable to incur  such
expenditure under the arrangements then existing.  The conditions of the Agree-ment as to Interest on Capital Expenditure were regarded by the Companies asunfavourable; they were disinclined to undertake capital expenditure, owing tothe prevailing high  rates  of  wages  and prices of materials;  and they were unwilling to  embark on development of their  undertakings,  in  view of  the uncertainty as to how they would be recouped for  the expenditure involved, in theevent of the  Government deciding to take over the Railways.   To meet this position the Railway Executive  Committee suggested that any new works thatmight be necessary should be financed by the Government.    The Government rejected the proposal that they should provide funds forthe necessary development of the undertakings, in view of the considerable fundsalready in the possession of the Companies.  They recognised, however, that therate of  interest allowed on capital expenditure  under the  Agreement  of  1916,viz., 4 per  cent., was less than  the rate currently  obtainable by the  Companieson investments, and  it was agreed that interest should be allowed on approvedcapital  expenditure,  incurred after 1st May, 1919, on new works or additionalrolling stock,  at the rate of 5 per cent,  instead of 4 per cent.,  and that the interestshould accrue, not from the date on which the works were brought into use, but from the date when the capital expenditure was  incurred.  At the same time an assurance was given  to the  Companies that &quot; in the event of their undertakingsbeing acquired by the Government, the Companies shall neither be financiallyprejudiced nor financially advantaged by reason  of having incurred capitalexpenditure under the present arrangements.&quot;    Apart from the additional concessions made to the Companies in 1919, whichwere probably unavoidable in the circumstances then obtaining,  the arrangementas to  interest on capital  expenditure  is a reasonable extension  of the originalAgreement as to Net  Receipts.   It provides, however, an example of the one-sidedcharacter of  many of the Agreements entered into by the  Government duringthe war.    It was specifically provided, in the agreed Clause inserted in the Pink Book,that in calculating the amount of capital expenditure on which interest was tobe allowed, a deduction should  be made for the value of works replaced.  Nosuch provision was  made,  however,  in  the  case  of works displaced  and notreplaced.  The object and effect of displacing works is no doubt, as a rule, to saveexpenditure on assets from which there is no longer an adequate return,  and insuch cases it  is reasonable that allowance should  not be made for the value of theworks displaced in calculating the amount of capital expenditure  ranking for interest.  In the event of displaced works being realised, however, the proceedsare either devoted to new capital expenditure in  another direction, in which  casethe Company receives interest on the  amount from the Government,  or they areinvested, and the interest realised accrues to the Company  below-the-line.    We are  of opinion that it is equitable to regard the whole of the assets ofwhich possession was taken  in 1914 as  remaining in the  possession  of theGovernment  throughout control, and  that in the event of any such assets beingrealised, the  revenue derived from the proceeds, in whatever form, belongs to theGovernment,    A substantial case of such realisation of capital assets  employed in the  baseperiod, without adjustment either of the standard net receipts or of the additional capital expenditure ranking for interest,  is that of steamships taken over bythe Admiralty.  As  these steamships  contributed&apos; to the net receipts of 1913, no payment was due to the Companies  in respect  of their use by the government during the period  of control.   A special Agreement was  entered into by theAdmiralty, however, under which payments have been made  to the companies in respect  of the cost, less accrued depreciation, of replacing  ships lost  or notreturned.  Under this Agreement the Companies  have received sums amountingto approximately  2,500,000,  and the Companies have presumably invested theamounts, and enjoyed the interest realised thereon below-the-line.     As the standard net receipts of the  Companies concerned have  not  been adjusted in respect of the sums paid by the admiralty, the Government is in theposition of  continuing to  pay  rent  for property  which  it has bought.    the adjustment of net receipts is  probably not a practicable course, and we  are ofopinion that  the position can only be equitablv met at this stage bv the companies concerned paying to the Government the amounts realised bv  them by  way ofinterest,  on the sums received  from  the Admiralty,  or  bv adjustment,  in theCompanies&apos; claims in respect of interest on capital expenditure, of the amounts   32046                                                               B  4
lanking  for interest,  in the manner  adopted  in  the  case of capital assetsreplaced.    We draw attention to the arrangement under which Companies are enjoyingrevenue, in addition to the guaranteed net receipts, from assets that were  revenueproducing in the standard period and have since been realised, and we recommendthat the matter be taken up with the Companies with a view to an adjustment by whatever may be considered the most convenient method from the accounting pointof view.Replace-        3.   The Supplementary Clauses to the Agreement, incorporated in the PinkStores     Bcok&apos; issued November, 1916, contained the following provision :-                    &quot; At the end of the period of Government control, a cash payment to                be made by the Government to each of the controlled  Companies equal to                the difference between (a) the book value of the stores in stock at the 5th                August, 1914, and (b) the value of the same quantities of similar stores                calculated                       (1)  as to the extent those quantities are in stock at the end of the                            control period, at the book values then ruling;                      (2)  as to the shortage in the quantity at the end of the control period                            as compared with the quantity at.the beginning, at replace-                            ment prices.                    &quot; The replacement prices to be agreed between the Treasury and the               Railway Executive Committee as fairly representing the prices at which               the shortage could be  made good, having regard to quoted market prices               at  the end of the control period, the probable  movement of prices and the               other circumstances of the case.   Any amounts already received by  the               Companies for replacement value of material used on work  done for  the               Government must be brought into account when fixing the amount to be               allowed under this Clause.                    &quot; Regulations in regard to the calculation of prices, and definition of               stores, and generally as to giving effect to this Clause, to be agreed between               the Government Accountants and the Railway Executive Committee.&quot;             The effect of this provision, if carried out, would be that the Companies would         hold, at the end of the period of control, a stock of stores equivalent to the stock         held in 1914, and standing in  their books at 1914 prices.             It should be explained that it is the normal practice of the Companies to debit         the cost of stores, when purchased, to a Stock Account, and,  as stores are issued for         use, to charge them to working  expenses at the average price at which similar         stores, held in stock on the date of issue, have been purchased.   This practice has         been continued during the control period, in conformity with the general principle         of the original  arrangement  that in preparing  its accounts for the purpose of         arriving at net receipts each  Company should  follow strictly  the practice which         regulated the preparation of its accounts in 1913.             As a result of this practice having been followed  in a period of rising prices,         the Companies have been under the necessity of replacing stores issued from time         to time,  at prices higher than those charged to working expenses (and borne by         the Government) in respect of the stores issued, and the difference in cost on re         placement  has been borne  by the Companies.    In other words,  the Companies         have themselves found the additional working  capital  required to finance their         stores at the increasing prices ruling during the control period.             In 1916 it was represented to the Treasury, on behalf of the Railway Com         panies,  that in consequence  of  their  practice  of charging  stores to working         expenses at average prices, instead of replacement prices, the  Companies ran the         risk of finding themselves burdened at the end of the control period &quot; with stocks         of materials, etc, purchased during the control period at inflated prices.&quot;             At the commencement of control no question was raised as to the propriety of         charging stores at average prices and not at replacement prices, and, indeed, from         the standpoint of the net receipts Agreement, it would clearly have been inequit-         able to charge at replacement prices.  If these were higher than average prices        the Companies would thereby  have received during the control period a profit on        their stores, in addition to the guaranteed net receipts, while if they were lower,        the Companies would have lost money by the transaction, which certainly was not        the intention of the Agreement.            So far as we are aware it has never been suggested that the Companies should        alter the practice of charging stores out at average prices, but it has been realised
that if as a matter of fact  stores had been charged out, not at average pricesbut at replacement prices, the Companies would have been secured against findingthemselves at the end of the  period with a stock of stores standing in their booksat inflated war prices.  Arguments have accordingly been put forward in supportof the view that the Companies would have been justified in charging out storesat replacement prices.    It is suggested, for instance, that this course would have been justified on theground that it was the intention of the original  Agreement that the effects of thewar should be &quot; blotted out,&quot; as far as the Companies were concerned, during theperiod of control.   We find considerable difficulty in dealing with loose phrasesof this kind that have been  grafted on to the original  Agreement  in support ofparticular interpretations of it.  To a certain  extent  it may be true that as a consequence of the Agreement the effects of the  war on the Companies have been&quot; blotted out &quot; during the period of control, but we cannot admit that it was theintention of the Agreement  to relieve the Companies of all the burdens arisingfrom war conditions.  It was not the intention, for instance, and it is not theeffect, of the Agreement, to relieve the Companies of the burden of  depreciatedmoney values in respect of their pre-war funds.    The extent to  which the Companies are relieved,  or may claim that theyshould be relieved, of such  burdens,  is  commensurate with the  ambit of theoriginal Agreement itself, and  we  are of opinion that it is not possible so toconstrue the  original  Agreement as to admit of  the  charging  out of stores at prices other than  average prices, or to provide for the &quot; blotting out &quot; of theeffects of the war  on the Companies&apos;  Stores  Stock Accounts, which  are outsidethe scope of the original  Agreement.    That Agreement had  reference to therevenue position of the Companies and was designed to secure to them a definedquantum of net receipts;  it was  not concerned with the capital position of theCompanies in any way, and  if one of the effects of the war was  to necessitate theprovision by the Companies  of additional working capital for the undertakings,that effect was not one that was &quot; blotted out,&quot;  or intended to be &quot; blotted out,&quot;by  the Agreement.   In the case of the additional working capital which theCompanies have been under the necessity of finding to enable them to pay increased wages, it has never been suggested that there was any case  for calling uponthe Government,  during  the control period, to  provide the  additional fundsrequired, nor is it contended that the Agreement as to Net Receipts places any obligation upon the Government to reimburse the Companies with the amount ofsuch additional working capital at the end of the period.    The increased cost of labour and the enhanced value of stores appear to usto be on precisely the same footing from the  standpoint  of  the  Net ReceiptsAgreement, and we regard the  proposition that Companies should be provided,at the, expense of  the State, with the additional working capital  required toenable them to  carry their 1913 stock of  stores  at enhanced prices, whether this be effected by charges for stores being raised  at replacement  prices, or by anyother means, as entirely irreconcileable with the purpose of the original Agree-ment.    That the Companies are entitled to interest on am/ additional working capitalthey may provide during the control period is a reasonable  application of theprinciple underlying the Agreement as to Net Receipts.    It  was  to meet theCompanies&apos; right  to such interest, inter alia,  that the Government agreed, totheir enjoying the interest on accumulated arrears of maintenance funds.    A further  contention put forward in support of  the Supplementary Agree-ment in regard to  Stores, and, incidentally,  in support of the proposition thatstores issued during control should have  been charged out at replacement prices,is that the Companies would have been within their rights in locking up the wholeof their stores on  5th August, 1914, and keeping them intact until  the end of theperiod of control, leaving the Government to finance the stores  required for rail-way working during the period.  This process of  argument avoids  the difficulties that seem to be inherent in any  attempt to justify the Stores Agreement by refer-ence to  the Agreement as to Net Receipts,  and  relies upon a particular interpre-tation of the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, under the provisions of whichpossession was taken of the Railways.  It is contended that the property of whichpossession  was taken in pursuance of that Act did not include stores, and that therefore the Companies could have locked them up.     The relevant terms of the Act are as follows:        &quot;......the Secretary   of  State  may......take       possession......of any railroad......and ol tne
       plant belonging thereto......For the purposes of this section       ......&apos;&apos;  Plant &apos;&apos; shall include any engines, rolling stock, horses,       or other animal or mechanical power, and all things necessary for  the       proper working of a railroad or tramway which  are not  included in  the       word &quot; railroad &quot;  .&apos;.....     We do not propose to enter into a discussion of the legal question involved inthe particular construction of this Section that has been indicated, beyond sayingthat primd facie it would appear to  be difficult to exclude stores from the categorycovered by the phrase &quot; all things necessary for the proper working of a railroad.&quot;     Whatever  may be the correct legal construction  of  the Act  of 1871 in thisrespect, we are of opinion  that the inclusion of stores in the undertakings of whichpossession was taken was an inherent condition of the  Agreement guaranteeingnet receipts, and a condition from which the Companies cannot equitably escape.The undertakings of which the net receipts were guaranteed were  clearly runningconcerns, provided not only with operating plant and equipment, but with  theworking capital necessary to operate them.   The working capital employed in  thestandard year contributed to earning  the guaranteed  net receipts, and it cannot reasonably be contended that it was open to the Companies to withdraw that work-ing capital during the period of control, while continuing to enjoy the guaranteednet receipts in full.     The documents leading up to the Agreement as to  Stores do not indicate withany certainty the reasons which, in the mind of the Treasury, were held to justifythe arrangement when it  was made.   It appears  to be clear, however,  that  thearguments by which the proposal was supported were not then based (as they have since been based) on the Agreement as to  Net Receipts, but were directed to aposition that it was anticipated  would arise at  the  end of  the  control period.Indeed the question was  raised,  in the  first  place, in view  of the fact that aparticular Company had been required by the War Office to lay in a stock of coallargely in excess of  anything they  were  accustomed to keep.   The Agreement,however, has no reference to stores  held by the Company in excess of their 1914stocks; it provides, on  the other hand, for  the replacement of shortages and  thepayment by the Government of  the enhanced value of  stocks held,  up to the limit of those held in 1914.    In either case, the possible  loss  against which the  Companies  were to be pro-tected was a loss arising,  not during, but after control,  in consequence of theirthen holding stocks bought at inflated war  prices.    In 1916, when the Stores Agreement was made, the big inflation of prices thatresulted from war  conditions had not  yet taken place.   It might reasonably havebeen thought at that time  that the country was passing through a period of tem-temporarily inflated prices, and that after the war there would be a comparativelyrapid drop in prices to what was probably regarded as their normal level.  railway rates had not been  raised at this time,  and there is no  reason to suppose that any permanent  increase of rates was in contemplation. In  such circumstances (and apparently only in such circumstances) the  Railway  Companies would, in  theabsence of any special  arrangement as to stores, have  suffered loss, at the end ofcontrol, by reason of their  holding stocks of stores bought at inflated prices, whichthey would have, in effect, to sell to  the users of the railways at normal rates.If the matter were so regarded  by the Treasury, that  Department may well havedecided, although the original Agreement placed no obligation upon the Govern-ment to relieve the Companies of  such loss, that it was nevertheless a loss whichthe Companies themselves should not  be  required  to bear,  and that it  would bemore convenient to meet the case by an Exchequer payment than  by what wouldthen have appeared to be the wholly impracticable course of raising railway ratestemporarily, after  control, in order  to place the burden  on the users of  the rail-ways, who,  in strict principle, ought to bear it.    We have accordingly formed the opinion that the Stores Agreement was a concession made by the Treasury to meet a position that it was contemplated, would arise at the end of the control period; that it was not  an amplification of theoriginal  Agreement,  guaranteeing  the  Companies  their  net receipts, andis essentially at variance with the principles of that Agreement.    The post-control conditions,  the expectation of  which  may have  justifiedthe concession in 1916, will apparently not obtain on  the termination of control,in view of the fact that the Companies&apos;  charging powers ha,ve now been placedon a level commensurate with  current prices, and are  presumably intended tic-cover the current  cost of stores.   If  this  be the  case the Companies will notsuffer the loss, in respect of stores bought  at war  prices,  against which the
                             CHAPTER V.ESTIMATE OF OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES, ACCORDING TO THE    INTERPRETATIONS  WHICH  MAY  BE  PLACED  UPON  THE    AGREEMENTS.   - The Railway Companies are at present unable to furnish an estimate of theclaims they may put forward at the end of the period of possession.  We under-stand, however, that these claims will fall under the following heads, and that thepossible extent of the liabilities thereunder, so far as they can be estimated, on thebasis of the interpretations understood to be placed upon the Agreements by theCompanies, may be as indicated.  These estimates  have been prepared from datain the.  possession of the Ministry  of Transport with the  exception of that forAbnormal Wear and Tea,r,  which was included in Command Paper 147/1919.    It should be clearly realised that these figures are merely estimates of theamounts the Railway Companies&apos; claims might possibly reach.   In the case ofArrears of Maintenance and Abnormal Wear and Tear the amount of the claimswill depend upon the trend of prices, and to the extent to which prices fall, theclaims  would be lower than the figures shown, which are based on prices at 200per cent,  above pre-war level.  In the case of Abnormal Wear  and  Tear theestimate is one upon which little reliance should be  placed :                                                                          Arrears of Maintenance : Abstracts A and B     ......    70,000,000                             Other Abstracts.........    20,000,000      Abnormal Wear and Tear   ...............    40,000,000      Replacement  of  Stores      .........     ......    20,000,000    . It is understood that the Companies may put  forward additional claims, atpresent undefined, under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871.   As we have indicated, we are of opinion that no such claims  are admissible.   (Chapter II,i ro             ...    .    .            ,      .&apos;;/.    It is not possible to frame any reliable estimate  of the amounts that may be payable to the Companies  in the event of the Agreements being  interpreted inaccordance with our recommendations, but it would appear that the amounts willbe, reduced to an insignificant figure.    The above are claims that cannot be presented until the end of the period of possession : account must also be taken of the current liabilities of Government during the remaining months of control, if the Agreements continue, to be applied on the basis of the Railway Companies&apos; interpretation of them.    No estimate can be given of the reduction in these claims that would be effected by the  adoption of our recommendations.   If normal maintenance charges be not restricted to the 1913 quantum, however,  the only limit to the liability of the Government in the case of  those  Companies who have  either overtaken  their accumulated arrears, or are able to overtake them before the end of control, is the limit of the Companies&apos; ability to spend.Stores Agreement was intended to protect them, and if the Agreement is carriedout, the amounts paid thereunder, which are estimated  at  20,000,000, will be clear profit to the Companies.    We accordingly recommend that the Stores Agreement be reviewed.   in fixing the&quot; present charging powers of  the Companies it is presumed that thecurrent  cost of stores was  taken into  acocunt.   Under  the circumstances,therefore,  as existing at present, there is no  justification for the arrangementthat the Companies should be recouped the cost of the  increased stores held bythem, at the end of control, by an Exchequer  subsidy.    It should be added that a special arrangement was made in regard to storespurchased by  the  Companies, after the  Armistice,  in  anticipation of normal requirements.

                             CHAPTER  VI.                          IRISH RAILWAYS.    The Order in Council under which possession was taken of the Irish Railwayswas dated 22nd December, 1916, and Government liability (with the exception ofa liability previously undertaken in respect of War Bonus) commenced as from 1st January,  1917.    The nature and  terms of the Agreements with  the  Irish Companies are practically identical with  the British  Agreements,  but in regard to one or two matters the position is more clearly defined in the case of Ireland.   One of these is the  question of the limitation of normal  maintenance to the 1913 quantum,in regard to  which the Board of Trade addressed  the Irish Railway ExecutiveCommittee in the following terms.           &quot;  I am directed by the Board of Trade to state that in all the circum-       stances, they will not press for the inclusion of the New Clause on page 5       of the amended draft,  on  the  understanding mentioned in your letter,       namely, that no Company will be allowed to  charge any Compensation       Account Repairs in excess of 1913 without the direct consent of the Irish       Railway Executive  Committee or such other justification as might satisfy       the Government Accountant.&quot;    The Irish Companies,  although not controlled until 1st January. 1917, wereguaranteed net receipts on the basis of 1913.                             CHAPTER VII.FURTHER STEPS NECESSARY TO SAFEGUARD THE INTERESTS OJ                             GOVERNMENT.    We have already referred, in  Chapter II., to the arrangement, adopted atthe commencement of the period of possession,  for the investigation of the Com-panies&apos; claims under the Agreement by an organisation of  railway accountantsset up by the Railway Executive Committee.    We are  satisfied that this arrangement,  although of great value to  theGovernment,  and the only arrangement possible at the time  it was  instituted,was not a satisfactory one when the war conditions which justified it no longerobtained.  On the establishment of the  Ministry of  Transport, officials of  theMinistry were associated  to a  limited extent  with the  railway accountants inthe supervision and checking of the Companies&apos; claims.  We are satisfied thatthe super-imposition of this official check was not only desirable in  itself,  but has been justified, by its results.  The tendency of the railway accountants was naturally and properly to be guided by a strict reading of the various AccountingInstructions that were issued by the Railway Executive Committee from time totime.   In some cases the literal application of these instructions produced results which were not in conformity  with, the underlying intention of the Agreements,and the effect of the official check imposed  by the Ministry of Transport, though this check has been  limited in extent, has been to bring the operation of  theAgreements under comprehensive review from a detached standpoint.   A numberof questions have consequently  been raised which in  other circumstances wouldprobably not have been raised.    We do not recommend that any attempt be made at this stage to impose a vigorous supervision and  regulation of railway expenditure,  or  to subject  theCompanies&apos; accounts to a full and adequate audit, but,  in view of the approachingtermination of control, we  are of opinion that the official check already institutedshould be continued, and that the responsible officers of the Ministry of  transport should be given such additional assistance as they may reasonably require, in orderto enable them to deal adequately  with the many questions that will necessarilyarise in connection with the Companies&apos; final accounts  and claims,
                            CHAPTER VIII.      SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.    Our principal conclusions may be summarised as follows :     1.   The character of the Governments &quot; possession &quot; of the Railways has, General.in the course of time, undergone a complete change.   It began as a temporarycontrol of traffic for purely military purposes,  with a liability for compensationfor purely military acts;  it has developed into a comprehensive  financial trans-action entirely  divorced from  military considerations, covering  the whole areaof railway administration, and continuing long after the circumstances whichoriginally justified it baveceased to exist.  (Chapter II, $2.)    2.   Possession was  taken  of the controlled Railway  Companies under theprovisions of the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871; it was intended by that Actthat the Companies should receive full compensation for loss or injury sustained in consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by the Act on the Secretaryof State for War.    When the  original Agreement between the Government and the  controlledRailways was concluded in 1914, it was the intention, and the expectation, of theparties that the Agreement should provide a just measure of the compensationintended by the Act of 1871.    Owing to circumstances not foreseen when the Agreement  was made, theCompanies have been completely protected against loss or  injury  arising duringthe period of possession, whether attributable to the operation of  the Act of 1871or not.    In view of the history of  the negotiations leading up  to the Agreement of1914,  we  have  considered whether we should recommend  the revision of that agreement with a view to the Companies being accorded compensation for loss or injury attributable to  the operation  of the Act of 1871, and  no more.   Wehave come to the conclusion, however, that in all the circumstances such a course is impracticable.  (Chapter II, $5.)    3.   The Agreement of 1914 guaranteed the controlled Railway Companies,collectively,  the aggregate net receipts,  shown  in the Published Accounts  of1.913,  of the first seven items of Account  No.  8  of the Statutory Accounts, lessa percentage deduction.   The subsequent Agreements were intended to  be  inthe nature  of  interpretations  and amplifications of the original Agreement.designed to  carry out the underlying purpose of that Agreement in changing circumstances.    The underlying  purpose of the original  Agreement  was  that  while theCompanies were under obligation to exercise all possible economies,  and preventall unnecessary expenditure, the financial results to each Company during theperiod of possession should be the same as they would  have been had the under-takings  remained under  the  control of the Companies and  the receipts and expenses of  each railway had been the same as they were  in the correspondingperiod of the previous year.  (Chapter II,  ^14.)    4.   When  the original Agreement was concluded it was the intention  ofthe parties that the  compensation  payable thereunder should be exhaustive  ofthe Governments liability under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871 (Chaptern, 15.)    Our recommendations, the more important of which are summarised below,must not be regarded as the result of an investigation from the legal standpoint.They represent  our view of the equitable  application of the Agreement, havingregard to all the circumstances surrounding its origin and the general intentionof the parties at the outset:     1.   Charges for maintenance in excess of the 1913 quantum appearing in the  Mainton-Companies&apos;  claims now under examination or  hereafter submitted should not be  ance.allowed; Companies to which payments in respect of  such excess charges  havealready been made should refund the amount of the excess; any Company claimingto have  incurred expenditure on making good abnormal wear and tear properlychargeable to Government account should substantiate its claim in accordancewith the conditions hereafter indicated (No. 5).  (Chapter III, gl.)    2.   Current payments on account of arrears of maintenance other than properrenewals provisions should be discontinued. (Chapter III, $2.)
interest on CapitalExpendi-ture.Replace -ment of stores.    3.  The Companies should utilise the funds already paid to them, on accountof arrears of maintenance, in defraying the whole cost of overtaking  deferredwork, before receiving further payments on account of  the additional cost ofarrears overtaken.  (Chapter III, $2.)    4.  No payments should be made in respect of arrears of maintenance out-standing at the end of the period of control, except to the extent to which it maybe possible  for Companies to  show that the amounts already paid to them are insufficient to provide for the making good  of physical arrears that may actuallyrequire to be overtaken.  (Chapter III, $3.)    5.  Any claims that may be put forward in respect of Abnormal Wear andTear should be justified on the  following grounds :       (a) That the abnormal wear and tear has been due to Government user of            the Company&apos;s undertaking;      (6) that the making good of the abnormal wear and tear forming the sub-            ject of  the claim has not been counterbalanced by reduced main-            tenance expenditure owing to subnormal wear and tear of other            portions of  the  Company&apos;s undertaking in  the same  or another            accounting period;      (c) that the amounts received or-receivable by the Company in respect of            normal maintenance are insufficient to provide for the making good            of the abnormal wear and tear forming the subject of the claim in            addition to normal maintenance.  (Chapter III, $4.)    6.  In view  of the fact that the Companies receive interest in  addition tothe guaranteed net receipts, in respect of capital expenditure on assets that werenot productive throughout the  standard  year, Companies should  not enjoyrevenue  below-the-line, in  addition to  the  guaranteed net receipts,  from assetsthat were revenue producing in the standard period, and have since been realised.The matter should be adjusted by whatever may be the most convenient methodfrom the accounting point of view.   (Chapter IV, $2.)    7.  The Agreement as to Replacement of Stores should be reviewed.    in fixing the present charging powers of the Companies it  is presumed that thecurrent cost of stores was  taken into account.  Under the circumstances, there-fore, as existing  at present, there is no justification for the arrangement that theCompanies should be recouped the increased cost of the  Stores held  by them,  atthe end of control, by an Exchequer subsidy.  (Chapter IV, $3.)    8.  The existing arrangements under which the claims of individual Com-panies are  investigated by  railway accountants,  with  whom  officials of  theMinistry of Transport are associated, should  be continued and extended as maybe considered necessary.  (Chapter VII.)    We desire, finally, to state our indebtedness to our Secretary, Mr. Twentyman.With  marked ability, and unwearying courtesy, he has obtained and marshalledthe data for which we asked,  and has drafted and redrafted our conclusions, asgradually formed, in regard  to matters very difficult of  correct and yet clearexpression.

    RESERVATION ON THE  REPORT  OF THE DEPARTMENTAL              COMMITTEE ON RAILWAY AGREEMENTS.    The claim of the Railway Companies is based on the operation over a pro-longed period of a Guarantee to make up a deficiency in their net receipts.  TheGuarantee arose out of the taking possession of the Railways under the powers given by the Act of 1871; but the  deficiency was not limited to that caused by theexercise of  these powers.    Under  such Guarantee the claim is made up, not only in respect of deficiencydue to control, but also of deficiency due to war and other causes.    I am strongly of the opinion that a claim so  made up is not equitable, andthat from it should be deducted  all amounts in respect of deficiency  not due tocontrol. Such deduction would follow on the reinsertion in the Guarantee ofthe words which were originally  inserted for  the  purpose of limiting the claim,and were deleted under pressure exercised at  the time.    My colleagues have rejected such a proposal as impracticable; I do not concur in this view, and must be taken to dissent from any argument appearing in thisReport in support of their action.    If the view of my colleagues is accepted,  I agree that the course recommendedby them is the nearest approach to equity and adequacy, and on that ground I join with them in signing this Report.                                              HARRY  BARNES.                                                     8th February, 1921.Committee  Room No. 25,    Ministry of Transport.             RESERVATION BY MR.  WILLIAM GRAHAM.    In the circumstances  attending this Inquiry, and the fact that within acomparatively short time the members of the Committee have had to apply their minds to a mass of agreements and undertakings between the Government andthe Railway Companies dealing with questions  of  great  technical  and othercomplexity, it is obvious that in the main all that is possible is a report whichsuggests a solution according to broad principle, capable, however, of compara-tively simple explanation.  When the original Agreement was framed in August,1914,  the governing Statute was the Regulation of the Forces Act. 1871.  Likeall legislation, the Act is not destitute of ambiguity, but it appears to be beyond doubt that  it specifies compensation only for what is clearly due to government control or possession of a railway undertaking.    As originally framed, the fundamental Agreement was consistent with theletter jtnd spirit of the  Act of 1871,  in that it included limiting words whichexcluded allowance or compensation for what could rightly  be attributed to warcircumstances in general as  distinguished from effects strictly attributable tocontrol.    But the Railway  Companies insisted on the deletion of the limitingwords, and under  pressure of national  emergency the  Government  gave way.This appears to me to  be the central point in  the present controversy.   Fromthis fundamental error in policy, inconsistent with the Act  of 1871, flowed otherconcessions throughout the amendment and amplification of the Agreements, the cumulative effect of which, in my judgment, was to give the Railway Companiesprotection against  the general circumstances of the war as  they affected british railways.  It is obvious that such a result cannot be defended   The agreements are clearly ultra vires.    Regarded  as contracts  they  fail because it is incon-ceivable that the minds of the parties ever really come together, whatever theappearance of agreement.  There is  admittedly an  almost complete absence  of reciprocity.  In any event, the consequences of strict adherence to the amendedtext would be contrary to public interest and policy.    I come now to the question of remedy.  My colleagues in Committee, whileemphasising the basis of the Act of  1871, have taken the  view that it is not a practicable policy to go back over the  events in the period of control and separatewhat was  attributable  to war circumstances  from what was attributable  tocontrol; in other words,  they do not think it feasible to re -insert .at this stage the
limiting words and proceed to adjustments on that footing.  In this respect theyare in agreement with the contention of the Railway Companies.  I regret that,in the absence of technical knowledge and such evidence as would convince me tothe contrary, I am unable to take that view.   It does not appear to  be disputedthat such adjustment would be the  ideal method  in the sense of strict justice,and it is, of course, only the application of the Act of 1871, which contains thepolicy from which no  departure should have been made.   Accordingly, whileagreeing with by far the greater  part of  the Report of my colleagues, both inargument and  in conclusion,  and thus able  to sign the main statement, I amcompelled to say by way of  reservation that, in my  opinion,  in  view of the enormous sums of public money involved, it is of the utmost importance that evenyet an effort should be made, and in the most resolute  manner, to review the wholecircumstances of the period of control, with their attendant liability  on the partof the State, if  any, in the light of  the re-insertion  of the limiting words.  Onthis point it must be remembered that the Railway  Companies  themselves have repeatedly stated that it was no part of their purpose to gain by the emergencyconfronting  the  State;  they have stated that they wished to be no better and no worse at the end of the period of control, but I suggest that this phrase is onlyacceptable if no better and no worse at the end  of control refers strictly to thescope and influence of  Government control itself.  Thus understood, the phraseappears to me to be nothing more than another way of  stating the central principleof the Act of 1871.  While recognising that  there may be certain abnormal factorsfor which a separate  arrangement  may  be  made,  as,  for example, abnormalwear and tear during control, I feel  that the  terms of the Act of 1871 should beregarded as exhaustive of the rights of the Railway Companies.  Further, it isclear that they themselves evidently appreciated the character of the Agreementswhen the phraseology in which they urged their officials and servants loyally toabide by the understanding which had been reached is considered.    The only point which remains refers  to the effect  of the recommendationsof the  Report of the Committee.  I have sought to ascertain whether in practicethey will amount to the reinsertion of the limiting words and  to the applicationof the Act of 1871.  On this question it appears to be impossible to get assurance,and, indeed, assurance can hardly  be expected, so complex is the whole range of controversy under review.  It might be suggested that so striking is the differencebetween the known claims of the  Companies and  what the Committee actuallyrecommends that in effect the position laid  down in the Act  of 1871 will beachieved.    But  on this point  it  appears  to  me  to  be  doubtful whetherthe Agreements  can ever  really be  interpreted accurately  to achieve this result.     It  will  be   remembered  that  what  the  Companies  acceptedwas  a guarantee of the net receipts of 1913  as providing  a  fair  defini-tion of  the compensation  to which  they  were entitled, i.e.,  compensationfor loss or injury due to the exercise of the powers of  the Secretary of State. Butthis foundation appears to me to be discredited by the practically admitted factsregarding the exceptional character of 1913  in the history of British railways.Tor these and other reasons I am satisfied that the Act of 1871 is  the only possible basis, and, however difficult it may now be to work back to that Act as a foundationin view of all that has happened, I would urge that the suggestion of impracticable-ability cannot,  at this stage,  be definitely  accepted to the final  exclusion of theother policy.  I believe this  view to be consistent with the opinion frequentlyindicated in the Report of  the Committee, that as  time  went on the relationsbetween the  Government and the Companies were progressively altered until theCompanies were ultimately safeguarded against probably the whole consequences of the war, whereas there is general agreement that the limits of their rights are fixed by what may be attributed to control.                                                  WILLIAM GRAHAM.8th February, 1921.
APPENDIX  A.(Note by the Secretary.)  SUMMARY OF ARRANGEMENTS IN REGARD  TO  MAIN-                     TENANCE.*  The following is a summary of the various arrange-merits in regard to maintenance expenditure, as theyaro  reflected  in  transactions  occurring  in   thoperiodical accounts and claims submitted by tho Com-panies to tho Government,  or  form the  subject of possible claims to be  submitted at the end of  thoperiod of control;        A. Permanent  Way and Hotting  Stock.  (1) Current Repairs. The whole  cost of repairsicarried out  during the period of possession,  withoutlimit, is  charged to working  expenses  currently,and borne by the Government through the Account of net Receipts.  (2) Current Renewals. The not amount charged to working  expenses  in   tho  Companies&apos;  accounts  for1913 in respect of renewals, after adding or deductingany amount  transferred  in that year to or from  arenewals   provision fund,   is  charged  to  working expenses  currently and  borne  by   the  government through the Account of Net Receipts.  Tho Government is  similarly charged through this account with the additional cost, due to the  increasein prices since 1913, of all renewals carried out duringthe period.  The effect  of  these two  transactions is that  theGovernment is charged currently in the  Account of net Receipts with the  whole cost of all renewalsexecuted during the  period, up to  the limit of  the1913 quantum, plus the 1913 cost of deferred renewals,if  any,  or tho additional  cost, due to increase ofprices since  1913, of renewals performed in excess ofthe 1913 quantum, if any.  (3) Deferred Repairs and Renewals. The extentto which  the repairs and renewals currently executedin either Abstract! fall short of the 1913  quantum 5for that  Abstract is  assessed,  on  a financial  basis,by  means  of  the   &quot; Arrears  of  Maintenance &quot;PonnulaH.    Cash  payments  on   account  of   theultimate  cost of executing  the ascertained arrearsare made currently,  at  the rate  of  115 per cent.of the 1913 cost of the deferred repairs, plus 15  percent,  of  the  1913 cost  of  the  deferred  renewals;(100 per  cent, of the  1913 cost  of  deferred renewalshas already  been  charged  in  the   Account  of  net receipts).  Appropriate adjustments  are  made to secure thatthe  Companies  receive  or  retain,   through   theArrears  of  Maintenance  Claims, only  the  amountsdue in respect of the net arrears  in  each Abstractaccumulated  to date, after making  allowance  forexcess in that Abstract in  any particular accountingperiod.  If a  Company has carried  out a  net excessof repairs,  however,   it  retains the  whole cost ofthat excess,  which has already  been charged in the account of Net Receipts.  (4) By the operation of the arrears of maintenanceformula  there mav  be  an  eventual adjustment inrespect  of the  additional  cost  of  excess  renowalscharged  in  the  Account  of  Net Receipts,  but thisadjustment  will  only  take  place  in  the  eventof a Company having, at  the end of control, arrears of  repairs of greater  amount  than  its excess re-newals an unlikely contingency.  (5)  There  is no corresponding adjustment  in  thocase of a Company having oxcoss repairs and arrears of renewals,  owing to the  fact that cash payments on  account  of the 1913 cost of  arrears of  renewalsare made through tho Account of Net Receipts, andnot  through tho Arrears  of  Maintenance  Claims.On  the other hand, a Company having excess repairs and  arrears  of  renewals   does  not  receive  thoadditional 15  per cent, on  account of the  ultimatecost of carrying  out  its arrears  of  renewals, unlessthero aro net  arrears  in  respect of  the  Abstractas a whole,  as in that case only can the percentageaddition  bo  obtained.  (6)  The Government is under obligation to  meet thebalance  of the  cost of executing the net arrears  of repairs  and renewals, combined,  in  each Abstract,when  tho work is actually performed.  (7)  Tho combined effect  of these various operationsis that  the  Government  is under liability to meetthe whole cost of carrying out the 1913 quantum of repairs and  renewals of permanent way and  rolling stock, in  respect of the whole period of possession,whenever  the  work is done, and at whatever cost.Payments on account  of the ultimate cost of deferredwork  are made currently at 115 per cent, of the costat 1913  prices of tho arrears shown by the  formula.In addition, if repairs and renewals in excess of the1913 quantum are executed during the period,  theGovernment is charged with the whole cost  of  the excess repairs,  and that  portion of the cost  of  the excess renewals which is due to the increase  in pricessince  1913.  (8)  Abnormal  Wear and Tear. In  addition to itsliability  in   respect  of  normal maintenance,  theGovernment has undertaken  to consider claims  inrespect  of the cost of making good  abnormal wearand tear arising during the period of control.B. Plant and equipment other than Permanent  Way                and Rolling Stock.  The arrangements for current payments on accountof arrears of maintenance apply only to maintenanceof Permanent  Way  and  Rolling  Stock.   In   thecase  of  other plant and equipment, the  Governmentis charged currently,  through the  Account of  net receipts,  with  the whole cost of  maintenance work carried  out, and  with the amount of any provisionsmade in 1913.   In the event of there being arrears of normal maintenance work at the end of the periodof control,  the Government  will  be liable  for  thewhole cost of making good, less any portion of  suchcost  already charged,  as provision, in the Accountof Net Receipts.                     .  .  * Tha term &quot; maintenance,&quot;  as generally used inthis  Report, is intended to  cover  all maintenance expenditure and provision, including expenditure on repairs,  partial  renewals  and  complete  renewals,reserves for depreciation and transfers to  provisionfunds.  i &quot; Repairs &quot; as used in reference  to Railway Com-panies&apos; accounts signifies repairs and  partial renewals;&quot; Renewals &quot; signifies complete  renewals, with  newmaterials throughout.  X Abstract A and Abstract  Ti are  the designationsof the  abstracts of expenditure  prescribed by  theRailway  Companies  (Accounts  and Returns)  Act,1911,   in  which  expenditure  on  the  repair  andrenewal of (A) Permanent  Way and Works, and (B)Rolling Stock are compiled.  5 The phrase  &quot; 1913  quantum &quot; of  maintenance,etc., is a convenient term by.which to express thecost of carrying out in any  year during tho periodof  possession, at  the prices currently ruling,  thequantity of  maintenance  work  represented by theamount charged to  working  expenses in 1913,  with appropriate additions in respect  of the maintenanceof capital assets brought  into use since 1913.  II This formula  is described in Appendix B.32046c
APPENDIX  B.(Note by the Secretary.)     CAMSUMTION OP ALLREAKS 01&apos; MAINTENANCE.         Arrears of Maintenance Formula.&apos;.  The  detailed  instructions&quot;  for tho calculation ofdeferred  maintenance  by means of  the Arrears ofMaintenance Formulae are extremely complicated, and involve  many   intricate  questions   of  a  technicalcharacter, both engineering  and accounting.  The  broad principle  on which they are based isthat the arrears of maintenance accruing in any year of account are measurc&apos;d by  the  amount by which theexpenditure  in  the year, when adjusted  in  respectof all variations, as compared with the standard  year,in relevant  conditions,  falls short  of  the  amount ofthe corresponding charge to working  expenses in thestandard year.  Tho  process followed  in tho Formula  is briefly asfollows:    The  amount  expended by  the  Company  in theAbstract concerned,  and  charged  to  Government intho  Account of  Net Receipts,  is taken  as the com-mencing  figure.   From  this is deducted  the  assumedcost, during the year,  of maintaining assets broughtinto use since   1913,  the amount,  if  any. expendedon making good abnormal wear and tear, and certain other items which it  is necessary to eliminate fromthe  expenditure of tho  year  before comparison ismade with the expenditure  of 1913.  Adjustment is similarly made, by  addition to thoopening figure,  in  respect  of items  included in theexpenditure of  1913, but not  in that of the year of account,  e.g., reduction in  mileage of line or rolling stock in service.  The  balance  obtained,  after these  various adjust-ments have  been made,  is reduced  by  a flat  per-centage, representing the difference in the price  levels of 1913 and the year of account; the resulting figure is the expenditure of  the  year,  adjusted for  com-parison wit hthat of  1913.   This figure is deducted from the actual  charge  to the  corresponding  Abstractin the  accounts of 1913,  the  difference  being theascertained  arrears of  work,  expressed  in terms of1913 prices, which is then increased by  15 per cent.,as a payment  on account of  the additional cost ofmaking good the arrears.  The figure thus obtained represents  115 per cent, ofthe  1913  cost   of the  ascertained arrears  of  bothrepairs  and renewals.    The  Company  has  alreadycharged to Government, through the  Account of net receipts, the whole  amount charged in 1913 in respectof renewals, and has transferred to a provision fundtho  amount not expended.  The amount transferredto  a  provision  fund  in  respect  of  unperformedrenewals must  accordingly be  deducted  from theascertained  arrears shown by the  formula.  This isdono after the addition  of 15 per cent, to  the 1913 costof the arrears, and the  balance, representing 115 percent, of the 1913 cost  of the ascertained  arrears of repairs, plus 15 per  cent,  of  the amount  reservedthrough the Account  of Net Receipts on  account ofunperformed renewals,  is paid to  the Company cur-rently through the Arrears of Maintenance Claim.              Defects  of Calculation.  Thi&apos;s method of ascertaining  arrears of  maintenanceappears to  contain  a   number  of  defects, of  whichthese detailed below are the most important:    (1) The standard  of  maintenance   work by  com-parison with  which arrears are ascertained is theamount charged to working  expenses in  1913.  Inthe  case of many Companies this  amount  includedconsiderable  sums transferred to provision funds inaddition to  actual expenditure on maintenance  workperformed in the year.   The more appropriate figure to take would seem to  be the actual expenditure in1.913, in respect of work performed in that  year,irrespective of transfers to or  from Provision Funds.While i&apos;t is not possible, in the absence of a complete  * The  instructions   are  printed  in  extenso  inAppendix T. VIDE  Yellow Book (1914-1915), p. 59;Green  Book  (1916), p.  72;  Brown  Book (1917-1918),p. 80.  Examples showing  the  working out of theFormula? are given  in Heliotrope Book, p. 64.investigation of the Companies&apos;  accounts, to affirmdefinitely that the amounts transferred to provisionfunds  by  particular  Companies  in 1913  wore notrequired for tho maintenance  of  the  undertakings,  &apos;it i&apos;s highly probable that to a large extent they represent-sonted over-provision, made in  pursuance of what isno doubt a sound conservative policy.  To the extentto which this is the case these  provisions were  in reality appropriations of net revenue, and they shouldnot bo included in the standard maintenance charges for the purpose of ascertaining arrears.  The Com-panies aro entitled to receive in each year of controltho actual  amounts so  reserved  in 1913, as if  thecharges had not been raised, the standard net receiptswould pro tanto have been increased.  It has been suggested that in all  the circumstances the Companies should retain the additional 15 percent,  of their 1913 provisions already  paid to them through the Arrears of Maintenance Claims,  and that similar  payments  should  be continued  during  theremainder  of the  period of possession, but  that theascertained  arrears  of  work should  be  reduced  inrespect of  the amounts provided and not  spent  in1913,  except in so far as any Company may be able tofurnish satisfactory evidence that the  amount  of  itsprovision  was a  proper depreciation charge  to  thorevenue of  1913 in addition to tho year&apos;s expenditureon maintenance work carried out.  Similarly, that in the case of those Companies who in 1913 met portions of their  maintenance expendi-ture by transferring sums from provision funds pre-viously  accumulated, the ascertained arrears of work-should be increased in respect of such transfers.  (2)  In the  Memorandum  of  Instructions  (BlueBook), Clause 4, it was  provided, inter alia, that theamount charged  for  the  Renewal  of  Rolling  Stockshould not exceed  the amount charged in  1913 except under  special  circumstances,  such  as  additions  torolling stock in  service  or an increase  in  the cost ofrenewal work carried  out  during the period  resultingfrom increased prices of labour  and materials.  Doubts having arisen as to the precise  meaning ofthis  Instruction,  the  Railway Executive  Committee,after  consultation  with the Government Accountants,issued an  agreed  interpretation of it  in  September,1916,  which provided, as  regards renewals of rolling stock, that a Company might charge the Governmentwith :      (a)  The amount  charged in 1913;    (I))  Such additional sum as  might be necessary to          make provision  for  the  renewal  of addi-          tional units or increased first cost  of rolling          stock  in service;    (c)  The amounts  attributable  to increased rates          of pay or prices of materials paid in respect          of renewals carried out  during the period          and  chargeable against  the Government.In arriving  at (b)  it was stipulated  that tho  Companymust follow its established practice,  if  one existed,and that where no practice existed the Company mustsatisfy  the   Investigators   and   the   GovernmentAccountants  that the  claim  made was  reasonable,having  regard to all the circumstances.  The provision under (b) has been generally appliedand with few exceptions the Companies have receivedadditional allowances for renewals based  on  increasedfirst cost.  The additional amounts  provided under (6) althoughcalculated on  &quot; first cost  &quot; which  is partially basedon  war prices when transferred  to the Company&apos;sRenewals Provision Fund, are assumed to be at 1913prices only.  The matter is a somewhat  complicated  one, and can perhaps be best explained by an illustration :-  In  the case  supposed,  a Company  had,  in 1913,1,000 wagons,  the original cost  of which had been 100,000 ( 100 per wagon); and in 1913 had spent orreserved for renewals,  4 per wagon,  or  4  per cent.of first cost, viz.,  4,000.  In each year of control up to 1919, no renewals wereperformed,  and the  Company  charged  tho Govern-ment account with  the sum of   4,000  per annum,transferred to a Renewals Provision Fund,
  In 1920,  150 wagons aru scrapped, and renewed atu east of  45,000  ( 300 per wagon),  of which theCompany&apos;s Provision Fund bears  15,000 (1913 costof 1920 work)  and the  Government  bears  30,000(additional cost  over 1913).  Tho  number of wagons possessed by  tho company is the  same as in  1913, but their &quot; first cost &quot; hasincreased from  100,000 to   130,000, as follows:-                                               Original cost, 1,000 at  100 ......  100,000    Less-Scrapped, 150 at  100     ...   15,000                                     85,000Add-Renewed,  150  at   300     ...   45,000                                       130,000  Under the  &quot; agreed  interpretation &quot;  referred toabove, the Company charges the Government accountwith  4  per  cent, on   130,000 -  5,200 per annum,as compared with the 1913 charge of   4,000. ,  ln other words, the Government is charged with auincreased  provision,  in  anticipation  of  the futurerenewal of  the  150  now wagons,  of  1,200  (i,e,,4 per cent, on  30,000,  the increased first  cost of tho150 wagons).  The quantum of maintenance expenditure tho  Coin-pany is entitled to charge  to  Government account has thus  been  increased  by   1,200 per annum.  as this  1,200 i.s spent, it is  assumed  to  be at 1913prices;  it is  therefore  worth to  tho Company,  ifspent  at  current  prices, say,   3,600  per annum.That is to  say, the Coinpany&apos;s spending  power hasbeen  increased by   3,600 in consequence of the  rc-nowal, at. Government  expense, of  150  wagons, and the  amount of  annual  provision  charged  to the(lovernment in respect of each of the renewed wagons,lias been increased from  4 to  36.  The position  is more  readily seen  if the increasein  renewal  provision is  dissected to show the  effect in tho case of one wagon :  	1913.	11120.	Increase.a 1.

(6) Shews the correct increase from 4 per cent, to12 per cent, to provide for the increase in cost ofwork if prices are  200  per cent, above 1913  rates.  It has  been urged that the  incorrect result shewnat (5)  is  obtained only  if  a Company is  in  arrearat the end of control,  and the  arrears are made goodat  1913  rates plus 200  per  cent.,  but  the  same result is effected if all renewal provisions  are spentduring control, since the spending  power of the re-newal provision is  as in (5)  and  not as in  (6).  In so far as increased first cost represents  addi-tional  rolling stock or increased capacity  or otherimprovement  of rolling stock,  the payment appearsto be a reasonable one, but where  it represents theadditional  cost of  renewing  rolling  stock  alreadyspecially paid by  Government  under (c), it does notappear  reasonable that the Government should becalled upon to make  a further contribution for in-creased  prices  other than  that through  the ArrearsFormulae.  It should  be added that Clause 4  of  the BlueBook did not provide  for an additional provision inrespect  of &quot; increased first cost &quot;  of rolling  stockrenewed, and that the agreed  interpretation of  that clause  under  which  the   additional   provision  is claimed was not formulated with the object of allow-ing it.  It would appear that the charging of  additionalprovisions  in  respect  of  the  increased first cost  ofrenewed  rolling  stock,  though  in  the absence  ofcontrol it  would  no doubt  be  in accordance with  a sound  accounting  principle,  should  be  disallowedduring control, in  view of the  arrangements in force under which provisions on the  1913 basis are equated,when spent, to current prices.  It is clear that  the Arrears of Maintenance havebeen artificially inflated in  consequence of  additionalprovisions  in respect of increased first cost.  (3) In  calculating the Arrears  of  Maintenance theexpenditure  in the  control  period  is  reduced bya  percentage  in  order  to  eliminate  the  estimatedproportion   of   such   expenditure   representingadditional  cost due to  rise in  prices  as  comparedwith 1913.  As in one Company alone  an error  ofone  in  this  percentage  co-efficient may  vary theGovernmcnfs  liability  for one  year  by   250,000,its accuracy is important.  The  increased cost of materials  is based, for thepurpose of this percentage, on  the ascertained  in-crease  in  cost of not less  than 80  per  cent, of the materials  issued and used  during the year.  As this increase  is  assumed to apply to  the  net cost  ofall materials, it is  suggested  that an unsatisfactoryresult  is  obtained, and  that  the increased  cost should have been calculated on as  nearly as possible100 per cent,  of the materials issued less  the  valueof the materials recovered.  (Vide  Appendix XlVa,p. 13,  Para. 3 (d).)  (4) The calculation of this  percentage appears  tobe defective in  that no account is taken  of creditsor materials recovered, e.g.,  scrap, and the  ascer-tained   arrears   of   work   are   in   consequenceartificially increased.  (Vide Appendix  XlVa,  p. 11,Para.  3 (a).)  (5) The  ascertained  percentage  of  increase  in wages  and materials   combined  is applied  to  thewhole  expenditure  in  the  Abstract, which includes a number of items which  have not increased in  thesame  ratio as wages and  materials.  To the extentto which items not containing  the full element  of increased prices are reduced by the percentage,  theascertained arrears of  work are artificially  enhanced.  The  chief  item  affected is  the  charge made  toAbstract A for  Engine Power  supplied by the  Com-pany  for such purposes as ballasting.  In the caseof several large Companies, charges under  this headhave  been made during the control period at.  1913rates.  As  in  the previous caso  tho effect is an artificialenhancement of tho arrears.   In  view of  tho  largaamounts involved, it is  suggested that the percentageshould be  ascertained   more closely, or  alternativelythat the expenditure shoud be analysed and a separatepercentage, ascertained as closely as possible, appliedto each class of  expenditure.  (Vide Appendix XlVa.p. 12,  Para. 3 (&amp;).)  (6) During and since the War, a large number oflocomotives and wagons  have been on loan to  theWar Office for servico  overseas under  an agreement by which they have been maintained by that depart-ment,  and reconditioned at its expense on  return toGreat Britain.   In calculating  arrears of maintenancefor years prior  to  1919, such  stock was assumed tobe in  railway service   and  maintained by  tho  Com-panies; tho Formula  to  this  extent overstates  tho32046
iii-rears  accrued.  It is  contended by the Companiesthat thi&apos;s is offset by abnormal wear and tear of thoremaining stock.  It is  not admitted that this is thocase.   If  it  is, the Companies  should substantiateclaims in respect of making good abnormal wear andtear,  as and when it is  made good; tho proper allow-ance  should  bo made,   in  calculating arrears,  forrolling stock maintained by tho War Office.  (7)  Another factor which  has tended to swell thearrears in the case of  rolling stock renewals arisesnut  of  duplications of  rolling  stock.   locomotives and  other  stock,  which would  normally havo  beoilscrapped at the end of their usual  life, havo  beenretained in  use  for a number of years after havingbeen fully  depreciated  and tho now stock built  toreplace  them have beon brought into use.  As allow-ances for depreciation arc  calculated on  first cost  orunits of stock in service,  Companies  have  continuedto accumulate  moneys  for stock  actually replaced.Thoro   is  no   contingent  liability  against   suchaccumulations,  and the ascertained  arrears aro prolanto artificially inflated.APPENDIX  0.

Dear Sir,     The  Executive Committee has received from Mr. Marwood an intimation  that the Government are prepared to agree that the question of the compensation to the Railway Companies, arising under the Act of 1871, should be adjusted on the following basis :      To ascertain the compensation payable the aggregate net receipts of all the Railways         taken over during  the period for which they are taken over shall be compared         with a similar aggregate for the  corresponding period of the previous year.  The         ascertained deficiency shall be the amount of compensation due.   Provided that         if the aggregate net receipts for the first half of the year 1914 are less than the         aggregate net receipts for the first half of the year 1913, the ascertained deficiency         shall be reduced in  the like proportion.  Any question as to the amount of the         deficiency shall, in default of agreement,  be determined by the Railway  and         Canal Commission.     I have to inform you that the Executive Committee have resolved to recommend to the  Companies, whose Boards will be summoned at the earliest  possible moment, the acceptance of this proposal.

Sir,     I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ofthe 6fch August on the subject  of the compensation to be paid under the Regulation of
    the Forces Act,  1871, to those Railway  Companies whose  railroads have been  taken    possession of, and  to state that the Board are glad to learn that  the Committee are    prepared to agree that the compensation should be adjusted on the basis shown in that    letter:        I am to add that  the Board of Trade note that the Committee have resolved to    recommend to the  Companies  the acceptance of this proposal,  and they  assume that    these include Companies other than those represented on the Committee.

Sir,        I am directed by the Board of Trade to advert to the discussion which took place at    the Treasury on the 6th August, when the Chancellor  of the Exchequer and the President    of the Board of Trade were present,  and I am to state, for the information  of the  Lords    Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, that, as a result of that discussion,  the Railway    Executive Committee were informed that the proposal contained in their Memorandum,    of which a copy (Enclosure No. 1) is attached, would be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-    ment subject to a proviso in the attached form (Enclosure No. 2).        A reply, of which a  copy (Enclosure No. 3) is attached, has now  been received from    the Executive Committee agreeing  that the question of compensation to the Railway    Companies arising under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, should be adjusted on the    basis proposed by them subject to that  proviso.        It is now proposed that each Company  should  enter into an agreement with  the    Government  giving effect  to the arrangement come to, and a  draft of the proposed    Agreement will be forwarded to the Treasury when it  has been prepared.        JJ*              Sj*       *[S      5JC      Sji              Sj!       *!*      *t*                              I have the honour to be,  Sir,                                            Your obedient Servant,                                                (Signed)  H. LLEWELLYN SMITH.    The Secretary,        Treasury, S.W.       (The Treasury acknowledged the receipt of this letter on 14th  August, 1914.)                (Enclosure No. 1 in Board of Trade Letter of 8th August, 1914.)        The  Executive  Committee recognise the desirability from the point of view alike of    the Government and of  the Railway Companies of  arriving at  some understanding in    advance as to the  financial arrangements necessary for  carrying out the scheme of Govern-    ment control of the  Railways under the Act of 1871, and as to the compensation payable    to the Companies  thereunder.        The provisions  of the Act leave open a number of questions which, in the absence of    agreement, would be very difficult of solution.   And  in turn the  fact of these questions    being open would seriously impair the efficiency of the machinery  set up to carry out the    provisions of the Act as to the working of the railways by the Executive Committee.       The essentials of any agreement on the subject appear to be that it should be         1.  Fair to both  sides-a national emergency being eminently an occasion where there              should be no standing out on either side for  extreme terms.       2.  Simple in effect and free from  administrative complications.       3.  Economical  in its results so  far as this  can  be achieved without impairing the              efficiency of the scheme.       The Executive  Committee have given  very careful consideration to the  whole  ques-)   tion, and the only form of agreement which seems to them to combine these three essentials,    and indeed the only one that seems practicable in the circumstances, is one under which    the Government in some form or other guarantee to the Railway Companies their normal    net receipts.        (B 16959)                         A3
    When all things are considered, the Executive Committee believe that an arrangement on the basis suggested would be both fair and advantageous to both sides, and in supportof this view they desire to point out -    1. As the Executive Committee are advised, in all countries where the Government           have  found it necessary to  take over privately owned Railways  in time of           national emergency, the practice has been to do so on the lines now suggested           by the Executive Committee, which seems to point to some such arrangement           being regarded  as  the most  suitable  in exceptional  contingencies of this           character.    2. While the Executive Committee appreciate the objection that certain branches of           traffic will be adversely affected, and perhaps entirely destroyed by the exis-           tence of war  apart from the military control of the  Railways, the emergency           itself  will create new traffics which in the ordinary way would yield substantial           revenues to the Railways e.g., first,  there will be the carriage of  troops and           munitions of  war on an exceptionally extensive scale; and secondly, there will           be a diversion to rail of traffic which, under ordinary circumstances, would be           carried by sea.  As an instance of the  second class of traffic may be men-           tioned the carriage  of  coal from the northern coalfields to London.  At  the           present time  more than half that coal is brought to London by sea, and  the           whole of this traffic must be diverted from sea to rail if the eastern ports are           closed or  London is blockaded.  A further  instance is that during the con-           tinuance of hostilities the Government are requiring an enormous weight of           Welsh coal to be conveyed to the English and Scotch east coast ports.  Taking           Immingham and Hull as an example, the average rate paid on the coal at the           present time  is 2s.  lid. per  ton; but if  this traffic is displaced by rail-borne           coal from South Wales, the conveyance charge on such coal would be four or           five times this figure, which  would, of course, if charged, be to the benefit of          the Railway Companies.    3. On the other hand, supposing the apprehensions of the Government are well founded           in fact, and there is  a diminution in the aggregate volume of traffic, then under           ordinary circumstances it would follow as a matter of course that, in order to           adjust themselves to  the new condition of things,  the  Railway Companies          would make  large reductions in the numbers of  their staff employed in the          working and maintenance of their undertakings.              In view, however, of the national emergency which now exists, the Railway           Companies do not desire to take any such steps, and indeed they assume it is          the wish of the Government that they should refrain from taking any such step          in order that  they may be in a position to deal with any emergency that may           at any moment arise.              It is submitted that these considerations differentiate the case entirely from          that of other traders  or commercial  bodies who  might be damnified by  the           Government talcing over their works.                   1    4. The proposed arrangement would do away  with the necessity of any  elaborate    -       system of accounting as  between the Railway systems of  the various Com-          panies, and also obviate the necessity of weighing, entering up and charging out           each  consignment of  Government traffic,  thereby  greatly  facilitating  the           despatch and delivery  of the traffic and also enabling considerable economies           to be effected which under the proposal of the Executive Committee  would           enure to the benefit of the Government.    Having regard to all these considerations the Executive Committee propose that thequestion ot compensation arising under  the  Act should be adjusted on the  following,basis    To ascertain the compensation payable the aggregate net receipts of all the Railways        taken over during the period for which they are taken over  shall be compared        with a similar aggregate for the corresponding period of the previous year. The        ascertained deficiency shall be the amount of compensation due.  Any question        as to the amount of the deficiency shall, in default of  agreement, be determined       - by the Railway and Canal Commission.    The sum so payable as compensation, together with the net receipts of the Railways        taken over, shall be distributed among  the Railway Companies in proportion to        the net receipts of each Company during the period with which comparison is        made.
    The above expresses the unanimous view of the members of the Executive Committee,who, if the  suggestion is accepted by the Government, are prepared to recommend its acceptance to their respective Boards, and to use  their best endeavours to procure its acceptance by the Companies not represented  on the Executive Committee.             (Enclosure No. 2 in Board of Trade Letter of 8th August, 1914.)    Provided that if the aggregate net receipts for the first half of the year 1914 are lessthan the aggregate net receipts for the first half of the year 1913, the ascertained deficiencyshall be reduced in the like proportion.

I have to say that while  the Executive Committee cannot believe that any company would be  capable of acting in such a manner, they have from the first regarded it as an obligation of honour to protect the Government against the possibility of such an event,and they had before your visit already taken steps to safeguard the position of the Govern-ment in this respect.

It would, however, appear possible that the financial position of some of the Companiesmay render some payment on account desirable, and a memorandum* is enclosed, showingcertain points raised by the Scottish Railway Companies, indicating the desirability in their view of payments of a portion of the compensation due at intervals of three months.     Under the arrangements made by the Committee no charges are being made by theCompanies for the carriage of naval and military personnel and stores, other than storesforwarded by Contractors, and for this reason the surplus receipts of the Companies are,as stated in the memorandum, largely reduced, and the financial position of the Companiesis consequently weakened.     In these circumstances the Board would  be glad if you would move Their Lordshipsto consider whether, should the necessity arise, they would agree to the payment on account   i * This document is not reproduced.

at the expiration of three months of a portion of the ascertained deficiency in net receiptseither to the Railway Companies collectively or to such Company or Companies as mayparticularly require assistance.    I am, however, to add that owing to alterations in the methods of accounting betweenthe Companies which have been adopted since the Railways have been worked collectively,the deficiency in the case of a particular Company could only be ascertained approximately.

MARWOOD.The Secretary,    Treasury.                                        (7)F. 175.                                                         BOARD OF TRADE.                                                             llth September, 1914.Sir,    I am directed by the Board of Trade to advert to  their letters of the 8th and 21stAugust on the subject of  the Agreement come to with the Railway Executive committee as to the basis on which compensation is to be payable to the  Railway Companies  underthe Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871,  and I am to state for the information of the lords commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury that they have received further representations from  the Railway Companies with regard  to that Agreement and also with regard topayments on account.    It was represented at a meeting with the  Railway Companies, at which the board had the assistance of Sir William Plender, that a clear understanding between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Railway Companies as to  the meaning to be attached to the words&quot;net receipts&quot; in the Agreement would save much future difficulty and would also probablyrender unnecessary a separate agreement being entered into with each Company.    The  Railway Companies  at first suggested  that &quot; net receipts &quot; should mean &quot; net income &quot; as shown in Form 8 of the  Accounts  scheduled to the Railway Companies(Accounts and Returns) Act, 1911; but a  counter-suggestion was made by Sir WilliamPlender that the whole of the items in that account under the heading &quot; MiscellaneousReceipts (Net) &quot; should be omitted.  Some of the items are constant or nearly so, and in a comparison of like periods of different years would cancel each other; others are triflingin amount, and one viz., &quot; General Interest &quot; raises a question of considerable difficulty,as interest on a Company&apos;s credit balance is treated as a revenue receipt, whilst interest on an overdraft is  not treated in  the  accounts as working expenditure.   The item isone that will in the present course of events largely diminish, and its omission is thereforedisadvantageous to the Companies.  The Companies are, however,  willing to  agree tothe omission of this and all other items under the headings of &quot; Miscellaneous  Receipts(Net)&quot; if H.M. Government is prepared to make monthly payments on account of  theliability due to the Companies.    It is represented that in the ordinary course of events many Companies after paymentof dividends have large debit balances at their bankers,  and that these debits are clearedoff by the receipts of the following month or months, but that this is not now taking place.Large quantities of traffic for naval and military purposes are being carried without pay-ment, and additional working expenditure is being incurred for similar purposes.   Tradersalso are not at present paying their traffic accounts readily, though in this respect animprovement is  expected;  and as a result of  the causes set out the Companies debitbalances are not &quot;being reduced and the sums due for interest thereon are accumulating.    A partial remedy for this state of affairs would be the payment by  the  Governmentmonthly  of the estimated liability, and  the  Companies ask that the payment should be afull and not a proportionate one.    The estimated liability for August will not be known until about the middle of October,when the liability for another month and a half will have accrued, and this in the viewof the Railway Companies would secure the Government from any loss in the event ofthe amount of the liability to the Companies for the month of August being overestimated.  VIn future months the estimate for each month would be ready by the end of the followingmonth, and  in that case there would be still a month&apos;s liability accrued  after the date towhich the estimate was made up.
The Board are of opinion that this would sufficiently secure the Government againsttemporary loss through overestimates. It would also in the opinion of the Board be agreat advantage to have a clear understanding as to the meaning attached to the term&quot; net -receipts &quot; and that which has been suggested by Sir W. Plender, and which theCompanies are prepared to accept subject to the estimated liability being paid monthly, willsimplify the preparation of accounts and will on the whole be advantageous to theGovernment. *In these circumstances the Board of Trade would be glad if you would move TheirLordships to sanction the following arrangements viz., That &quot; net receipts &quot; should meanthe net receipts shown in Form No. 8 less the items under the headings &quot; MiscellaneousReceipts (Net),&quot; and that the estimated liability should be paid monthly in full at a datenot less than one month after the period to which the account is made up.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) H.

F. 175.Treasury Chambers.9th October, 1914.19141/14.Sir,The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury have given their careful con-sideration to your letter of the 11th ultimo and to Mr. Marwood&apos;s letter of 21st Augustlast relative to the Agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the RailwayCompanies, and I am now directed to request you to lay before the Board of Trade thefollowing reply:The questions raised in your letter were discussed inter alia at a Conference held lastmonth at which the Comptroller and Auditor-General and representatives of your Depart-ment, the Customs and Inland Revenue and this Board were present, and the conclusioncome to, with which My Lords are in agreement, was that it would be justifiable to makemonthly payments in full of the estimated Government liability under the Agreement,it being understood that the August accounts will be sent in by about 15th October, theSeptember accounts by the 31st October, and subsequent accounts by the end of themonth following the month to which they relate, and that payment will be made onlyafter the several monthly accounts have been examined at the Board of Trade and trans-mitted to this Department.

In these circumstances, and having regard to thesimplicity of accounting which is obtained by the method suggested in your letter, MyLords agree to the proposal.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,- (Signed)  T.

Marwood, Esq.,Board of Trade,Whitehall, S.W.(13)Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.\5th October, 1914.(Instruction No. 108.)Dear Sir,Compensation Payable under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871.On the 8th August, 1914, I wrote the Secretary of your Company with reference tothe subject of the compensation payable by the Government in respect of their takingover of the Railways, and enclosed an extract from the Minutes of the Meeting of theExecutive Committee held on the 6th August, 1914.Although that Minute contained a complete statement of the principle on which thecompensation payable to the Railway Companies under the Act of 1871 should be ascer-tained, it was inevitable that important questions of detail would arise in reference to thecarrying out of the bargain.One very important question was the subjectof general interest.;        ; ;v&quot;&apos;&apos;-&apos;It was obvious that however satisfactory the basis of compensation might be, theadjustment of the amount and its payment at the end of the period of Government controlwas a different thing from the normalaccrual day by day of cash receipts equalling thoseaccruing in the corresponding period of 1913. !It therefore became a matter of great importance to induce the Government if possibleto assent to periodical payments on account instead of postponing the settlement withthem until after the period of Government control had expired.Another matter of importance was the question of exactly what should be includedin the expression &quot; aggregate net receipts &quot; of all the Railways taken over.It was known to be the view of the Government that those receipts should be takento mean the net receipts covered by the first seven items in Account No. 8 of the FirstSchedule to the. Railway Companies (Accounts and Returns) Act, 1911, and thatMiscellaneous Receipts in that account should not be included.
This matter was very carefully considered by the Executive Committee in conjunctionwith ,a Committee of Railway Accountants, and the conclusion arrived at was that if theRailway Companies could secure the great advantage of monthly payments on accountof the compensation ultimately due, they might well concede the definition of &quot; aggregatenet receipts&quot; desired by the Government.This result has now been obtained, and I enclose a copy of a letter addressed to theExecutive Committee by the Board of Trade setting forth the arrangement made withthe GovernmentsPlease acknowledge receipt.Yours faithfully,&quot;(Signed) H.

The best reply I can give you under thecircumstances is to tell you what was decided at this morning&apos;s Cabinet. First, weagreed that a concession to the railwaymen was advisable much as we all regrettedthe short life of the &quot; duration of the war &quot; Agreement. Second, the General ManagersCommittee seemed to us to be the proper instrument for negotiating with the men.Third, they should do their best under the difficult conditions now surrounding theproblem. Fourth, the Government undertakes to extend the period of guarantee ofnet receipts to two years after the termination of the War.You may show this letter, if you think fit, to any of your colleagues who may careto see it.Yours sincerely,(Signed)   WALTER RUNCIMAN.Note - Sir Gilbert Claughton was at this time Chairman of the Railway Companies Association.

(25%) of the bonusallowance to men in the Conciliation Scheme as denned by the Agreementsigned on the 13th February, 1915.   IP(2) The Government to agree to treat as a normal item in working expenses any otheradvances granted to other classes of Railway employees.(3) The Government to agree to abolish the proviso as from the 1st January, 1915,which, of course, means that the net receipts for the year 1913 without deductionwill constitute the basis of comparison for the purposes of compensation.I shall be glad to hear from you whether the Executive Committee are authorised,when communicating their recommendation to the Companies, to state that the Governmentare prepared to accept the terms.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) H.

F. MARWOOD.Sir H. A. Walker,Railway Executive Committee.(19)R. 2547.F-19L Board of Trade,6$ March, 1915.Sir&apos; I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for the information of the Lords Com-missioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, that the Railwaymen s Unions recently approached^Railway Compares of Great Britain with a view to the grant of a special^increaseof wages in view of the rise in prices and the increased strain of work since the war began.
The Unions asked for an all-round increase of 5s. a week, but after negotiations theyaccepted an offer by the Companies to pay a war bonus of 3s. and 2s. a week to employeesreceiving less than 30s. and 30s. or more respectively. This arrangement applies to allmen included in the Railway Conciliation Scheme that is, the operating staff generally.The Board regard this as a fair settlement. In view, however, of the fact that someincrease of wages would probably have been necessary in ordinary circumstances, it did notappear to them that the whole of the war bonus should be included in the working expensesof the Railways for the purpose of arriving at the amount payable under the Governmentguarantee.They informed the Railway Executive Committee of their view, and negotiations tookplace with a view to settling the proportion in which the cost of the bonus should be borneby the Government and the Companies respectively.After negotiations, of the progress of which Their Lordships were informed from timeto time, it was finally agreed by the Railway Executive Committee that they would re-commend the Railway Companies whose undertakings have been taken over under theRegulation of the Forces Act, 1871, to accept the following conditions :-(1) The Company to agree to bear twenty-five per cent. (25%) of the bonusallowance to men in the Conciliation Scheme.(2) The Government to agree to treat as a normal item in working expenses any otheradvances granted to other classes of Railway employees.(3) The Government to agree to abolish as from the 1st January, 1915, the provisoto the Agreement under which the sum payable in compensation is reduced inproportion to the decline in net receipts in the first half of 1914 as comparedwith the like period of 1913.The abolition of the proviso will have the advantage of doing away with the trouble-some questions which have arisen regarding the application of the Agreement to the variousspecial services performed by the Companies for the War Office and Admiralty outside theirordinary functions.As regards the financial effect of the arrangement, so far as the Board are able to forman estimate, one quarter of the war bonus to the operating staff which the Companies willnow pay themselves, and which will not be included in their working expenses for thepurposes of the Agreement, will be at the rate of about  750,000 a year, whereas the amountwhich the Government would secure by the retention of the proviso would only be at therate of about  450,000 a year, so that the net effect of the arrangement will be a considerablesaving.As regards grades other than those included in the Conciliation Scheme, I am to pointout that the rates of wages paid are determined to a large extent by the rates paid to menengaged in similar work by private employers, and the Board consider that any increaseswhich it may be found advisable to grant may properly be treated as working expenses forthe purpose of the Agreement.The terms set out above are, in the opinion of the Board, fair to all the parties concerned,and they would be glad if Their Lordships would be so good as to give their covering sanctionto the arrangement, if accepted by all the Railway Companies.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,   .The Secretary, (Signed) W.

that we should ask you, in the new circumstances, to agree to the Companies arriving attheir liability under the arrangement referred to by assuming that such liability is equalto 12j- per cent, of the increased war bonus payments to the Conciliation men as from thedate from which the increase has been granted.This will very considerably modify the accounting, and I shall be glad to hear thatthe Treasury will accept the proposal.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) H.

(24)F. 191.Board op Trade.5th November, 191.5.Sir,With reference to previous correspondence respecting the Agreement between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Railway Companies of whose lines possession has been takenunder the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871,1 am directed by the Board of Trade to trans-mit herewith, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of HisMajesty&apos;s Treasury, acopy of a letter which has been received from the Railway Executive Committee askingfor a modification of the existing arrangement as regards the payment by the Companiesof a portion of the war bonus to men coming within the Conciliation Scheme.The Board understand that before the recent increase in the war bonus the amountpaid as bonus to men in the Conciliation Scheme was simply totalled at the Companies,head offices and 25 per cent, deducted. In future, however, as the men who receivedthe original bonus of 2s. or 3s. now all receive 5s., reference would have to be ma&apos;de in eachcase to see whether 6d. or 9d. should be deducted, and for this work the Companies wouldrequire to employ additional clerical staff. They suggest, therefore, that they should be&quot;permitted to make an all-round deduction of 12J per cent.As the number of men who received the 3s. bonus is slightly the larger, this would meansome reduction in the proportion of the total paid by the Companies themselves, but on theother hand the additional staff would be saved.The Board of Trade would be glad to be favoured with the views of the Lords Com-missioners on this proposal.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) GARNHAM ROPER.The Secretary,Treasury.(Railway Executive Committee letter of 29th October, 1918, enclosed, Document No. 23.)F. 191.

Companies in respect of the year 1916 under Railway Executive Committee CircularLetters Nos. 211, 212, 224, 248, 279, 443, and 692. This will render unnecessary theexchange of accounts between Companies in respect of the Company&apos;s proportion of warbonus as from 1st January, 1917, and any accounts already rendered in respect of thecurrent year must be adjusted in the agreed commuted figure.2.

MOGGRIDGE.The Secretary,Treasury.(Railway Executive Committee letter of 31st May, 1917, enclosed, Document No. 27.)(29)F. 192.P. 826/1.Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.2lst September, 1917.Dear Sir,War Bonus to Railway Employees.  Proportion borne by the RailwayCompanies.Some few weeks ago I spoke to you in regard to a matter that has caused a gooddeal of concern on the part of the Railway Companies generally viz., the payment bythe Railway Companies out of their net revenue of a portion of the original war bonusgranted to men coming within the scope of the Conciliation Scheme. You asked thatthe views of the members of this Committee should be placed before you in writing, andthis I now have pleasure in doing.The facts which led up to the arrangement now complained of are as follows :-The original agreement between the Government and the Railway Companies enteredinto in the first week of the war reads as under : -&quot;The question of the basis on which compensation under the Act of 1871 should be&quot; ascertained was discussed, and &quot; It was RESOLVED to recommend that to ascertain the compensation payable&quot; the aggregate net receipts of all the Railways taken over during the period
&quot; for which they are taken over shall be compared with a similar aggregate for&quot; the corresponding period of the previous year. The ascertained deficiency&quot; shall be the amount of the compensation due. Provided that if the aggregate&quot; net receipts for the first half of the year 1914 are less than the aggregate net&quot; receipts for the first half of the year 1913, the ascertained deficiency shall be&quot; reduced in the like proportion.&quot; Any question as to the amount of the deficiency shall, in default of agreement, be&quot; determined by the Railway and Canal Commission.&quot; The sum so payable as compensation together with the net receipts of the railways&quot; taken over shall be distributed among the Railway Companies in proportion&quot; to the net receipts of each Company during the period with which comparison&quot;is made.&quot;The actual decline in the net receipts of all the controlled Railways for the first halfof 1914 compared with the first half of 1913 was  732,500-3*6 per cent, of the total netreceipts for the 1913 period, and had the original agreement been kept to, any deficiencyclaimed by the Railway Companies from the Government would have been reduced bythis percentage.In actual practice, however, had all Government traffic been paid for during the periodof the war, the net earnings of the Railway Companies would have shown a considerableincrease, so that there would have been no deficiency from which to make any deduction.The Railway Companies would therefore have been entitled to the same net revenueas in 1913.In January, 1915, the Railway Companies asked that the proviso contained in theAgreement should be cancelled on the plea that they were actually carrying more trafficthan in 1913 instead of less.When the first war bonus was granted to the men in the Conciliation Scheme theGovernment considered that the Railway Companies should bear a part of the cost thereofon the plea that had there been no war the Companies would inevitably have been com-pelled to give increases to their staff through the operation of the Conciliation Boards.The members of this Committee protested strongly at the time against what theyconsidered to be an unjust demand, and a compromise was ultimately arrived at, theCompanies agreeing to bear 25 per cent, of the original bonus on the understanding thatthe obligation under the proviso in the Agreement of August, 1914, should be cancelled.The Railway Companies are still paying this 25 per cent, of the original war bonus. Thesepayments amount to  450,000 per annum.Now that the war bonus has disappeared under the arrangement entered into withthe Unions, with the consent of the Government, as from August 1st, 1917, we feel stronglythat the burden imposed upon the Railway Companies should be removed, and that thearrangement under which the Companies bear 25 per cent, of the original bonus should nolonger obtain.In support of this we would draw your attention to some figures which we have hadprepared and which are included in the summary* attached to this letter. I am to saythat these figures are more or less in the nature of estimates, and that those under theheading of &quot; Arrears of Maintenance and Renewal Work &quot; Abstracts &apos; A &apos; and &apos; B &apos;will, in all probability be exceeded. The amounts due for interest on capital expenditureupon works brought into use subsequent to 31st December, 1912, are also subject to revision.The figures, however, disclose that whereas the total amount paid by the Governmentto the Railway Companies as a result of the control of the Railways from the commence-ment of the war to the 30th June, 1917, has been under  40,000,000, the amount of freeservices rendered to the Government has been nearly  57,000,000, showing that duringthe period under review the Government benefited by the &quot; Control&quot; to the extent ofabout  17,000,000.We shall be glad to hear that we may advise the Kaiiway Companies as from the1st August, 1917, they are relieved of the obligation of bearing 25 per cent, of the originalwar bonus.Yours faithfully,(Signed) H. A. WALKER,The President, - Acting Chairman.Board of Trade.* Not printed.(b 16959) . B 3
(30)F. 192., P. 826/1.Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.9th November, 1917.Sir,I have to refer to our letter of the 21st September in which a request was containedthat the Railway Companies should be relieved of the obligation of bearing 25 per cent, ofthe original war bonus.   To this letter we have not yet received any reply.We would urge that our application should be acceded on the grounds of equity, andif any further argument or reasons are required, we would plead that in view of the enormousamount of work that has been put upon the Railways, the shareholders who have foundthe capital which has enabled that work to be carried out for the benefit of the State shouldreceive every consideration from the State.As a matter of fact, Railway shareholders are, generally speaking, receiving less dividendthan they did in 1913, and we think it only right to say that they are, in all probability,the only large community of the State which, while their property is being used for thefull benefit of the State, are in a worse position than they were pre-war.Then, again, we would put forward that the circumstances are very different to thosecontemplated when the original agreement was made. At that time it was anticipatedthat the Government would become heavy debtors to the Railway Companies, and it wasonly natural that the Government should ask that their liability might be reduced propor-tionately to the falling off in traffic that was apparent in the first half of 1914 as comparedwith the corresponding half of the basis period.These anticipations, however, have been entirely falsified, and the Government,instead of assuming any liability, have, after taking everything into consideration, reapedsubstantial advantages out of the arrangement come to.Another argument we might urge is that had the Railway Companies not been underGovernment control, they would have been entitled to have raised their rates to corre-spond with the increase in their working expenditure, due to increased wages, and increasedprice of materials. Such a course, however, has been averted partly owing to the economiesthe Railway Companies have been able to effect as a result of the present arrangement,and partly as a result of the alteration in the class of traffic which has been, passed overthe Railways. Therefore the traders as well as the State and the general body of consumershave also benefited as a result of the present arrangements.It is true that the public have had to pay a heavy increase for travelling, but thisincrease, as is well known, was not established for the purpose of creating revenue, butfor the purpose of preventing unnecessary travelling on the part of the public.In view of the great advantages which the present control of the railways by theGovernment has produced to the State and to the trade of the country, we would stronglyurge that the suggestion contained in our letter of the 21st September should receivefavourable consideration, and that the request contained therein should be acceded to,in order that the shareholders in the various Railway Companies may, as far as possible,be placed in as good a position as obtained in the year 1913.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)  H. A. WALKER,Acting Chairman.The President,Board of Trade.(31)F. 192.TREASURY!Itth February, 1918.Dear Marwood,I have now looked up what occurred with the Railway representatives when theGovernment Agreement with the Railways was modified in 1916. I find thatin December,1915, Sir Guy Granet handed to me a document in which there were six proposals outlined,
which it was suggested should be embodied in a fresh Agreement. Among these sixproposals was one that the whole cost of the war bonus should be reckoned in workingexpenses. - On 29th March, 1916, Sir Alexander Butterworth saw me and Bradbury anddiscussed these proposals: we then definitely told him that the Treasury were not preparedto concede the proposal that the whole war bonus should be regarded as working expensesin view of the definite bargain come to when the first bonus was agreed to. Sir Alexanderwrote to Sir H. Walker on 30th March and explicitly mentioned the Treasury refusal toagree to this point. On the 20th June, 1916, after various interviews had passed betweenthe Treasury and the Railway representatives, Sir Alexander wrote to me and said thatthe Companies represented on the Railway Executive Committee &quot; are prepared to acceptthe proposals of the Treasury as set out in my letter of the 30th March to Sir HerbertWalker.&quot;Sir Alexander also suggested in the same letter of the 20th June that the proposalsof the Railway Companies which had been agreed to by the Treasury^ should be embodiedin a formal letter addressed by the Board of Trade to the Acting Chairman of the RailwayExecutive Committee. This letter, as you are aware, was drafted, and has been agreedto by the Railway Companies. No reference was made in it to the war bonus question,and the history of the negotiations showed that owing to the Treasury refusing to agreeto the Railways&apos; proposal, it was not thought necessary to make any mention of the matterin the final letter embodying the agreed points. I think, however, that it was perfectlyclear right through that the Treasury having agreed to the other important matters raisedby the Railways it was not intended by them to press the point about the war bonus.Under these circumstances I think it is quite out of the question for the Treasury toregard the war bonus question as still open to discussion. We regarded the modificationof the Agreement come to in 1916 as the final word; anyhow on all matters which hadhitherto been fully discussed.I return you the enclosures which you left with me,Yours sincerely,(Signed)  T. L. HEATH.Sir W. F. Marwood, K.C.B.* These proposals are contained in Document No. 71.(32)R. 3664.F. 192.Board of Trade,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.22nd February, 1918.Dear Sir Herbert Walker,The President asked me recently to ascertain what view the Treasury would holdas regards an application that no portion of the war bonus to railwaymen coming withinthe Conciliation Scheme should be borne by the Railway Companies. I accordinglywent to the Treasury and discussed the matter with Sir Thomas Heath, and left withhim your letters on the subject. He then referred to what took place at the time of certainnegotiations between the Railway Companies and the Treasury, and he has now sent mea letter, of which I enclose a copy for your information.Yours faithfully,(Signed) W.

III.-APPROVAL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE ACCOUNTSOF CONTROLLED RAILWAY COMPANIES.[On the 18th December, 1914, the Board of Trade consulted the Treasury as to theapproval of the proposed Memorandum of Instructions, the draft Instructions thensuggested being, with the slight modifications indicated in the following cor-respondence, the same as those finally approved and printed below.]DocumentNumber. page(33) Letter of 1st January, 1915, from the Treasury to. the Board of Trade, approving theInstructions with certain slight modifications   ...       ..................25(34) Letter of 2nd January, 1915, from the Board of Trade to the Railway Executive Com-mittee, forwarding a copy of the Treasury Letter of 1st January, 1915       .........  25(35) Letter of 16th January, 1915, from the Railway Executive Committee to the Board ofTrade, accepting in the main the modifications, but asking for certain assurances with regardto Arrears of Maintenance   ............     ..................26(36) Letter of 19th January, 1915, from the Board of Trade to the Treasury, forwarding a copyof the Railway Executive Committee letter of 16th January, 1915    ............26(37) Letter of 10th February, 1915, from the Treasury to the Board of Trade, agreeing to theInstructions and to the view expressed by the Railway Executive Committee as toArrears of Maintenance     ......     ........................27(38) Letter of 13th February, 1915, from the Board of Trade to the Railway Executive Com-mittee, intimating that the Instructions had been approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government 27(39) Memorandum of Instructions as approved-known as the Blue Book ......     ...  28Vide also Appendix XVI.
(33)F. 182.28657/14.Treasury Chambers.1st January, 1915.Sir,I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury Mr. CarnhamRoper&apos;s letter of the 18th ultimo (R. 13676), relative to the draft Memorandum of Instruc-tions to be issued by the Railway Executive Committee.In reply I am to request you to inform the Board of Trade that, on the understandingthat Mr. Gurney Fowler sees no material objection to the Memorandum, My Lords concurin its terms, subject to the following observations:I. In substitution for Section 4 (e)* They suggest the following words: &quot; In the event of the Companies being of opinion that arrears of normal maintenancework have arisen during the control period, His Majesty&apos;s Government haveundertaken to consider on their merits any representations submitted to Them ;and, if necessary, a statement should be prepared at the end of the control periodof any liabilities of this nature not included in the accounts prepared currently.(No such statement will be required in cases where provision is made for mainte-nance by carrying definite sums to a special fund in anticipation of actualexpenditure.)&quot;II. The form of the Certificate under Section 13 is a matter of some importance;and My Lords do not think that it would be literally accurate to say that the accountshad been prepared in accordance with the Agreement.  They suggest the following form : &quot; We have examined the accounts attached and compared them with the books andvouchers of the Company. We certify that they are correct and that they havebeen prepared. strictly in accordance with the Memorandum dated 1915 issuedby the Committee of Chief Accountants with the approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.&quot;III. As regards the signatures to be appended to the Certificate, My Lords wouldhave preferred not to omit any of the three categories, viz.-Chief Accountants, Auditors,and Professional Accountants; and, even if it prove necessary to accept the signaturesof either the Auditors or the Professional Accountants (in addition to those of the ChiefAccountants), They think it essential that in every case the signature should be that of aperson or firm having recognised professional qualifications.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)  T. L. HEATH.The Secretary,Board of Trade.* Section 4(e) in the draft memorandum of instructions read as follows : Section 4 (e).Arrears of Maintenance Work.(e) A statement to be prepared at the end of the control period of the amounts not included in theaccounts prepared currently for the purpose of obtaining payments on account of compensation in respectof arrears of normal maintenance work deferred during the control period.R. 64.

(35)F. 182.Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.lQth January, 1915.Sir,Referring to your letter R. 64 of the 2nd instant, enclosing a letter from the Treasurywith reference to the draft Memorandum of Instructions, I am instructed by the RailwayExecutive Committee to say that they are prepared to accept the form of words suggestedby the Treasury in substitution of clause 4 (e) (Arrears of Maintenance Work).In view, however, of the importance of the point, and of the generality of the languageused to express the undertaking of the Government, they think it right to place on recordtheir understanding that, in this clause, the Government admit the principle that, if inthe special circumstances obtaining during the period of control, a Railway Company has topostpone works of maintenance [i.e., the repairs and renewals of its works and plant), whichin the ordinary course would have been executed within the period and their cost chargedas working expenses, the cost of such works, when they come to be executed, is a fair chargeagainst the Government. The Railway Executive Committee feel bound to emphasisethis point, because without a distinct understanding with regard to it they would not feeljustified in advising Companies, as they have been doing, to undertake the manufactureof the very numerous articles of military equipment which are being made in the shopsof many of the Companies, work which is obviously outside the ordinary functions of aRailway Company, and the execution of which must necessarily interfere seriously with theupkeep of the Companies&apos; undertakings.As regards the form of certificate, under Instruction 13, which was adopted fromthe Memorandum of Sir William Plender, the Executive Committee have no objectionto the alterations proposed by the Treasury, but as the Instructions will be issued by theExecutive Committee, they suggest that the Certificate read as under : -&quot; We have examined the accounts attached, and compared them with the booksand vouchers of the Company. We certify that they are correct and that theyhave been prepared strictly in accordance with the Memorandum of Instructions,dated January, 1915, issued by the Railway Executive Committee with theapproval of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;As regards the signatures to be appended to the certificate, the Executive Committeeagree that in every case the Certificate should, in addition to that of the Chief Accountantof the Company, bear the signature of a person or firm having recognised professionalqualifications.It is believed that the above are the only points outstanding with reference to theMemorandum of Instructions, and in view of the necessity for the early issue of theseInstructions to the individual Railway Companies, the Executive Committee ask thatthe formal approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government may be conveyed to them at as earlya date as possible.I am, Sir,t Your obedient Servant,(Signed)  H.

(39)MEMORANDUM OF INSTRUCTIONS TO RAILWAY COMPANIES FOR THEPREPARATION OF THE ACCOUNTS TO BE PRESENTED BY EACHCONTROLLED COMPANY TO ARRIVE AT THE AMOUNT OF COMPEN-SATION PAYABLE BY HIS MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT.Issued to the Railway Companies on 4th March, 1915, and known as the BLUE BOOK.Agreement with Railway Companies.1. His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed with the Railway Companies concernedas follows: &quot; To ascertain the compensation payable, the aggregate net receipts of all the&quot; Railways taken over during the period for which they are taken over shall be&quot; compared with a similar aggregate for the corresponding period of the previous&quot;year. The ascertained deficiency shall be the amount of compensation due.&quot; Provided that if the aggregate net receipts for the first half of the year 1914 are&quot; less than the aggregate net receipts for the first half of the yearl913, the ascertained&quot; deficiency shall be reduced in the like proportion.

The measureof withdrawals from stores in advance of actual use should be equal at the beginningand end of the control period.Arrears of Maintenance Work.(e) In the event of the Companies being of opinion that arrears of normal main-tenance work have arisen during the control period, His Majesty&apos;s Government haveundertaken to consider on their merits any representations submitted to them;and, if necessary, a statement should be prepared at the end of the control periodof any liabilities of this nature not included in the accounts prepared currently. (Nosuch statement will be required in cases where provision is made for maintenance bycarrying definite sums to a special fund in anticipation of actual expenditure.). Published Accounts for 1913.5. The net receipts (as defined) of each Company appearing in the published accountsfor the year .1913 must be used in arriving at &quot; Net Receipts &quot; for the correspondingperiod of control, and for the first six months of that year respectively.Net Receipts for Half-Year ended 31st December, 1913.6. Method of arriving at the Net Receipts (as defined) for the half-year ended 31stDecember, 1913, to be as follows: Take the figure of Net Receipts (as defined) for year 1913, as perprinted Accounts, and deduct therefrom the Net Receipts of J JointLines, as per Account No. 10. This will give the Net Receipts of theCompany (as defined) for the year 1913.......... From this must be deducted the Net Receipts (as denned) of half-year ended 30th June, 1913, adjusted as under: Deduct the amount of Net Receipts of J-JointLines, included in Account No. 10...... Add the amount included in respect of charges forcomplete renewals of Permanent Way and RollingStock and provisions therefor - Abstracts A, B (1),(2) and (3)       ............ Deduct one-half of the amount shown in theprinted accounts for the year 1913 for completerenewals of Permanent Way and Rolling Stock andprpvisions therefor Abstracts A, B (1), (2) and (3)..

Division of uet receipts for half-year to 31st December, 1913, between corre-sponding control and non-control periods to be arrived at as follows :-&quot; Net Receipts &quot; (as denned) for the corresponding control period in 1913 tobe arrived at by apportioning the net receipts of the half-year ended 31st December,1913, on the basis of the ratio the total traffic receipts (Statement No. 10) for suchcorresponding period bears to the total traffic receipts of that half-year.Division of Gross Railway Traffic Receipts for August, 1913.8. Having regard to the varying conditions of the holiday traffics of the Companies,it is not practicable to devise a uniform method of dividing the total traffic receipts ofthe month of August, 1913, between the corresponding control and non-control periods.Each Company therefore to make such division in the manner which will, in their opinion,fairly apportion the total traffic receipts of that month to such periods, provided that27/92nds of the amounts received for the conveyance of mails and parcel post for thequarter ended 30th September, 1913, be apportioned to the period 5th to 31st August.
Transfers for Reserves.9. If transfers from impersonal accounts were made in 1913 for the purpose, forexample, of increasing the provisions or reserves for bad and doubtful debts, renewals,pensions and provident funds, and such transfers were taken from accounts in creditcreated in earlier years and not required for the objects and purposes for which they werecreated, such transfers should not be allowed to affect the net receipts of the two yearsfor comparative purposes.Net Receipts for Half-Year ended 30th June, 1914.10. In giving effect to the proviso in the agreement with the Government that inthe event of the aggregate net receipts for the half-year ended 30th June, 1914, beingless than for the corresponding period of 1913, the aggregate compensation payable bythe Government shall be proportionately reduced, the net receipts for the half-year ended30th June, 1914, to be adjusted by adding thereto the amounts charged in respect ofcomplete renewals of permanent way and rolling stock for that period, and deductingtherefrom one-half of the total charges under those heads for the year 1914.Interim accounts for the half-year ended 30th June, 1914, must be carefully reviewedwith the view to their revision, if necessary, in order to ensure that they shall be prepared,&apos;for the purpose of the claim for compensation, on the same basis as the net receiptsfor the half-year ended 30th June, 1913.Form of Accounts for Control Period.11. The accounts for the period of Government control in 1914 to be prepared inthe same form and with the same detail as are required by the Statutory Form of FinancialAccounts so far as such form deals with the Revenue Statements and Abstracts precedingthe heading &quot; Miscellaneous Receipts (Net) &quot; in Account No. 8, but omitting the Receiptsand Expenditure of J Joint Lines appearing in Statement No. 10 (Receipts and Expendi-ture in respect of Railway Working). The expenditure incurred in &quot; Watching, Patrolling,&amp;c,&quot; and &quot; Payments to Families of Reservists, &amp;c,&quot; to be shown as separate items inStatement No. 10 after the item &quot; Running Powers,&quot; and included in &quot; Total TrafficExpenditure.&quot; /Statements as to Reserves.12.

36(41)F, 186.Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.27th October, 1914.Sir,Manufacturing Work Performed by the Railway Companies for theGovernment.You will, no doubt, be aware that the Railway Companies have to some extent placedtheir Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Works at the disposal of the Government, and havepromised to undertake the manufacture of any articles which are urgently required by theWar Office or Admiralty.Arrangements have already been carried out to construct 12,000 stretchers, and7,000 general service wagons, and other matters are at the present time in course ofnegotiation.The Companies have no wish to make a profit out of such work, and they are willing toreceive nothing more than bare cost that is to say, the amounts actually expended inwages1 and materials with the usual percentage to cover supervision and general charges.The Executive Committee think that you should be advised of this fact inasmuch asthe undertaking of such work necessarily involves the postponement of the usual renewaland repair work which would otherwise have been carried out to the various RailwayCompanies&apos; plant, the cost of which would, under the Agreement come to with the Govern-ment, have been included in the expenses incurred during the period of Governmentcontrol.All the work so postponed will have to be made good as soon as the manufacture ofarticles undertaken on behalf of the Government is completed; but as this latter work mayoccupy some months and even extend as long as the Government control of Railwayscontinues, we think it should be made clear that the Railway Companies may sooner or laterhave to include in their claim against the Government a sum to cover the cost of the workwhich is deferred and which will have to be overtaken.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) H. A. WALKER,Acting Chairman, Railway Executive Committee.The President,Board of Trade.(42)F. 186.20th May, 1915.MEMORANDUM ON THE FINANCIAL QUESTIONS ARISING OUT OF THEMANUFACTURE BY RAILWAY COMPANIES OF MUNITIONS OF WAR,(Railway Executive Committee Memorandum.): The financial questions which call for decision in consequence of the Railway Companieswhich are under Government control undertaking the manufacture of war munitions forthe Government on an extended scale fall under three heads :-(1) The charge to be made.(2) The mode of payment.(3) The effect of such manufacture upon the ordinary work of the Companies, andthe safeguards necessary in connection therewith.(1) The charge to be made.(a) If the work is being done directly for the War Office, very little difficulty arises.The case seems to be fairly met by the Instruction already issued by the Executive Com-
mittee (No. 169a.) and agreed to by the War Office, which provides that the charges forarticles manufactured for the Government are to be made up as follows :--(1) Materials. If bought specially-at cost price plus usual charges for carriageand handling. If used out of stock-at replacement prices plus usual chargesfor carriage and handling.(2) Labour.  At cost price.(3) Workshop Expenses.  Usual workshop expenses as applying to4he various shops.(4) Supervision and Establishment Charges.   121 per cent, to be added to the totalsof items (1), (2) and (3).It is really immaterial what amounts are charged for workshop expenses and supervisionand establishment charges, as these will be credited to revenue expenditure and so willenure to the benefit of the Government. It has been suggested that some allowanceought to be made for the use of the Companies&apos; premises and plant in other words, apayment in the nature of rent or interest on capital, which would be retained by the Com-panies. In principle there is much to be said in support of such a claim, as the manufacture -of war munitions does not fall within the purpose of the Government control of Railways ;but in view of the general readiness on the part of all connected with the Railways to assistin Government work without profit, the Executive Committee do not wish to press thisclaim if the other points which call for consideration can be met.(b) If the work is being done for private armament firms the matter is not on quitethe same footing, but it is assumed that steps will be taken by the Government to ensure thatsuch firms do not make a profit upon work carried out for them at cost price by a RailwayCompany. This is a matter rather for the Government than for the Executive Committee,but it is suggested that, if the price paid by the Government to a manufacturing firmincludes work done by a Railway Company, the case will perhaps be adequately met bythe Instruction already issued by the Executive Committee that, in the case of work for aprivate firm, an additional charge of 10 per cent, for profit be added to the cost of thework, such charge being credited to working expenses. It would probably be better if,wherever practicable, the work done by a Railway Company were excluded from thecontract with the firm.There is one point that has to be dealt with whether the work is being done for theGovernment or for a Government contractor viz., payment for materials purchased butnot used, or work only partly executed, at the end of the control period. It is submittedthat in such cases either the work should be completed at the cost of the Government, orthe work and materials should be taken over and paid for as they stand.(2) The mode of payment.Seeing that the Railway Companies will be working without profit to themselves, it isessential that they should be adequately financed, and it is suggested that the followingprocedure be adopted : -The Executive Committee should from time to time submit to the War Office anestimate of the total cost of all the new work which is being undertaken for the Government,and also at the beginning of each month (four weeks) a statement, which would be preparedfor them by the Committee of Railway Accountants, giving the anticipated expenditurein wages and materials during the coming four weeks. Within 14 days after the submissionof the latter statement the War Office should pay over to the credit of the Executive Com-mittee a sum equal to such anticipated expenditure, which would be distributed amongstthe Companies in proportion to the estimated outlay of each, so as to prevent any Companyhaving to withdraw its own money to pay for Government work. Accounts showing theactual amount expended by each Company during each period of four, weeks, togetherwith such certificates as may be required for audit purposes, should be submitted eachmonth to the Government, so as to show the actual outgoings as compared with the sumspaid to the credit of the Executive Committee, and any surplus or shortage should becarried forward to the following month&apos;s account. * The sums received by each Companyfrom time to time would be treated as payments on account, and, as soon as eachmanufacturing order was completed, the account for that order would be settled by theGovernment, and any necessary adjustments of accounts made.It will be realised that the essential features are-(1) That the shareholders of theCompanies shall not be called upon to find money for executing Government work at aloss to themselves in the shape.of interest charges; and (2) that the accounts relating toeach order shall be finally settled as and when the order has been completely executed,. so as to avoid an accumulation of small queries which would have to be cleared of! perhapsmonths after the work was finished.)
These two points arise equally whether the work is being done directly for the Govern-ment or for a private firm, and the procedure suggested is thought to be suitable in eithercase.(3) The effect of such manufacture upon the ordinary work of the Companies, and thsafeguards necessary in connection therewith.No Railway Company can undertake manufacturing work for the Government witli-out its normal work suffering. In the case of renewals the difficulty is partly met by theMemorandum of Instructions agreed with the Treasury, which recognises as one of the cir-cumstances that justify a charge in excess of the amount included for renewals in theaccounts of 1913, an increase in the cost of renewal work carried out during the period ofGovernment control and resulting from increased prices of labour and materials. This,however, only applies to renewals actually executed during the control period, and, there-fore, the more that a Company does in the way of war manufactures, the less is its casemet by this provision.The question of maintenance (using that word in its narrower sense as covering merelyrepairs and minor renewals) is still more difficult. It has been realised from the first that thework of manufacture undertaken for the Government and other circumstances arising outof the war (e.g., the large number of men joining the Colours), would bring about what hasbeen spoken of as &quot; arrears of maintenance,&quot; and the Treasury have admitted the principlethat the cost of such arrears, when they come to be executed, is a fair charge against theGovernment. But the present understanding is that the claims of the various Companiesin respect of such arrears of maintenance shall be dealt with at the end of the period ofGovernment control.It may be doubted whether the decision to postpone dealing with this question untilthe end of the period of control was a wise one in the interest of either the Government orthe Companies, for such postponement is almost certain to lead to a number of difficultand complicated questions. But if the Railway Companies are to undertake the manu-facture of munitions of war on any considerable scale, the interference with the upkeepof their rolling stock and plant may be so serious as to put it out of the question to dealwith the matter by each Company presenting at the end of the control period an accountagainst the Government for estimated arrears of maintenance. As stated in the Memoran-dum submitted to the Secretary of State for War: &quot;It would mean a number of verycomplicated arbitrations, and the position would be intolerable to the Government andthe Companies alike.&quot;One method of dealing with the question would be for the Companies to charge in theirworking expenses in respect of the repair of rolling stock during the period of Governmentcontrol a sum based on the corresponding items in the Companies&apos; accounts for 1913, apercentage being added to the 1913 figures to cover the higher prices of 1915. An objectionto this method arises from the fact that, owing to the Companies making their contractsfor materials at different periods, they are not equally affected by the rise in prices. TheGovernment would presumably be unwilling, on account of the labour involved, to agree. to the different percentage being fixed for each separate Company, while it would be verydifficult to fix a uniform percentage that would at the same time be fair to all Companiesand not unfair to the Government.The Executive Committee therefore recommend that, as regards both renewals andrepairs actually executed, either by the Companies in their own shops or by contract, thework be charged in the ordinary way at current prices, and that arrears of work that isto say, the renewals and repairs which are due to be carried out, but which the Companieshave not been able to execute be charged at a uniform percentage above the amountexpended in 1913. It is impossible to say what prices will prevail in the future, either asregards labour or materials, but it is suggested that 12J- per cent, would be a fair additionto make to 1913 figures for the period up to 31st December, 1915, the figure being leftopen to review as from the latter date.If this suggestion be adopted, it will be necessary to prescribe the mode of arriving atthe amount of arrears, but it is thought.that there would be no difficulty in doing thisupon the basis of the amounts expended on or debited to renewals and repairs in 1913and the control period respectively, after making allowance for the difference in prices inthe two periods that is to say, the amount by which the expenditure in 1914 or 1915 fellshort of the amount spent upon similar items in 1913 after the necessary adjustments offigures due to enhanced prices, would represent the arrears or shortage of work in thecontrol period.  Allowance would also have to be made for any increase that a particular
Company might be able to show in the quantity of its rolling stock or in the wear andtear to which such stock had been subjected during the period of control.In considering what percentage addition to the figures of 1913 would be fair, it mustbe borne in mind not only that both prices and wages have gone up very much since 1913,but also that in the case of repairs, even with prices remaining constant, the postponementof work beyond the date when it properly falls due in itself involves additional cost. Forone thing, arrears have to be caught up and work done under pressure, involving overtime,and other extra payments, but more serious still is the fact that the plant itself falls intoa condition necessitating more extensive repairs than would have been required if the workhad been taken in hand in ordinary course : the case is an exemplification of the old adagethat a stitch in time saves nine.These last considerations do not admit of any very accurate estimate, but there isno doubt that the money loss they represent is substantial, and, if the postponement werefor a long period, would be very serious indeed.It is understood that it is not proposed that the Railway Companies should undertakework involving the provision of additional plant or buildings on any considerable scale, but,if such provision were necessary, it is assumed that the expense would be undertaken bythe Government, the provision of minor items being included in working expenses.(43)F. 183.Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co.,Gresham College,Basinghall Street,London, E.C.20th July, 1915.Dear Sir,At a Meeting presided over by you on the 18th June, which I attended and at whichthere were present representatives of the Treasury and of the Railways, the latter statedthat in their opinion it was inexpedient that the method of dealing with the arrears ofMaintenance Work (Clause 4, Sub-Clause E of the Memorandum of Instructions5&quot;) shouldbe left in abeyance until the end of the control period.They suggested to the Treasury that the expenditure for the corresponding periodsof the year 1913 might be taken as representing fair figures on which to base future calcu-lations ; that the Railways should be allowed to charge in their claim against the Govern-ment up to the 31st December, 1915, the amount by which the 1914-15 expenditurereduced to the basis of the 1913 prices should prove to fall short of the 1913 expenditure ;that to this amount there should be added a percentage of 12^ per cent, as representingthe rise in the rate of wages and in the prices of materials between 1913 and the date ofthe Meeting.The Treasury generally approved of the suggestion of the Railway representatives,but desired some evidence to be given them, justifying the 12J per cent, increasereferred to.I was asked to examine figures to be produced to me by the Railways in support oftheir contention, and to report to you if, in my opinion, such figures justify the increaseasked for.I am now able to report that in accordance with my request, nine of the large RailwayCompanies, viz.: CaledonianGreat CentralGreat NorthernGreat WesternLancashire and YorkshireLondon and North-WesternLondon and South-WesternMidlandNorth Easternhave furnished me with returns showing the cost of building an engine, a carriage and awagon as at the end of June, 1915, compared with the cost of building similar vehicles of* See Document No. 39,

The following are the averagepercentages of increased cost shown :-Engine (two Railways less than 12j per cent.) .. .. 14* 95Carriage (one Railway less than 12J per cent.) .. .. 15*21Wagon (two Railways less than 12j per cent.)    ..      ..    16&quot; 99In accordance with my request the Great Western and Midland Railway Companieshave furnished me with statements of the cost of the principal articles used by them in therepairs of locomotives, carriages and wagons. Items selected for comparison are statedto cover from 78 per cent, to over 88 per cent, of the total cost in materials of the repairsof locomotives, carriages, and wagons. They may thus be regarded as being fairlyrepresentative.The percentage of increased cost is as follows : Great Western.     Midland.Principal materials used in repair of Locomotives        ..........       24&apos;50 26&apos;03Carriages     ............       31&apos;36 12&apos;99Wagons      ............       24&apos;27 14&apos;11Having regard to the above figures, which have been certified by responsible officials,I am of the opinion that the 12  per cent, asked for is justified as a fair charge up to the31st December, 1915. It is to be observed that the above remarks relate only to repairsof rolling stock.If the Treasury approve of the suggestion made by the Railway Companies, thefollowing formula would give the required figures : The expenditure in 1914-15 or period underconsideration....................*Less a percentage thereof to bring down to1913 cost       ....................
The proposal, so far as it relates to rolling stock and the question of the allowancewhich, if payment is to be made currently, will have to be made for the probable increasedcost of the work when it comes to be done, were discussed at a meeting at this office onthe 18th June, at which their Lordships were represented. It was arranged that theCompanies should furnish Mr. Gurney Fowler with particulars of the increase of cost inthe construction of rolling stock, and that he should report on the reasonableness of theaddition to be made in estimating the arrears, which it was proposed should be 12J percent, up to the end of the present year.Mr. Fowler has now reported that this figure is in his opinion a reasonable one, anda copy of his report is enclosed herewith. *I am to inquire whether Their Lordships are willing to allow the Railway ExecutiveCommittee to include in their monthly statements of the deficiency in the net receipts ofthe Companies under control an amount calculated on the method proposed to representarrears of repair and renewal of rolling stock.It is understood that a similar proposal will be made with regard to permanent waymaintenance, and when details are received, Mr. Gurney Fowler&apos;s opinion thereon will beobtained.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,-  (Signed) W.

It was further agreed that this percentageshould apply only up to the end of the year 1915, and that a further proposal should beplaced before the Government for succeeding years.

45(50)R. 638.F. 188.Board of Trade.3rd May, 1917.Sir,I am directed by the Board of Trade to refer to the Treasury&apos;s letters of the 26th Augustand 23rd September, 1915, on the subject of the payment to the Railway Companies ofamounts calculated to represent arrears of repair and renewal of rolling stock and of per-manent way respectively, together with an addition of 12^ per cent., and I am to state,for the.information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, that theRailway Companies have raised the question of an alteration in the presentarrangements.The addition of 12J per cent, referred to was to be made for a period from 4th August,1914, to 31st December, 1915, and a new figure was to be proposed for the year 1916. TheRailway Companies have in effect put forward a proposal that this figure for the year 1916should be 33 j per cent., but an alternative arrangement is now suggested under which thepayment of 12J per cent for the period ended 31st December, 1915, should be regardedas a payment on account only, and that for 1916 and onwards a percentage should becharged not representing the increase due to the rise in cost of materials, but a paymenton account, and that when the time came for the deferred repairs to be carried out a finalsettlement should be made.The arrangement proposed is set out in Sir Alexander Butterworth&apos;s letter of the3rd April, 1917, of which a copy is enclosed, together with a copy of a letter from Mr. A. W.Wyon of Messrs. Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co., to whom a copy of Sir Alexander Butterworth&apos;sletter was forwarded. The matter has since been discussed at an interview with SirAlexander Butterworth and Mr. H. W. Thornton as representing the Railway Companies.They expressed a desire to make an arrangement which should be fair alike to the RailwayCompanies and the Government, the present arrangement being regarded as unbusinesslikeand very uncertain in its operation ; as, for instance, if the percentage for 1916 was 33J percent. and possibly a much higher figure would be necessary for the present year -whilstthe repairs ultimately were carried out when the cost of materials was considerably lowerthan it is now.- The Railway Companies&apos; representatives expressed the opinion at thisinterview that the final adjustment, if their proposals Were accepted, should take placereasonably soon after the cessation of the period of control, and they would consider thata settlement within a period of a year would be reasonable.The question was raised at the interview why any additional percentage should bepaid now if a settlement is ultimately effected at prevailing prices, and it was suggestedthat it might be more convenient to the Treasury to pay a sum on account now instead of alarge sum later on. There was some diversity of opinion amongst the representatives ofthe Railway Companies as to what the additional percentage should be at the presenttime, and 20 per cent, was mentioned ; but it is thought not unlikely that they would bewilling to continue to accept an addition of 12^ per cent, if it was recognised that thepayment already made for the period up to the 31st December, 1915, was a payment onaccoimt only.Mr. Wyon, who was present at the interview, is of opinion that from the informationbefore him the percentage to be allowed under the existing arrangement for 1916 must beconsiderably in excess of 20 per cent., though in view of the present proposals he had notgone fully into the claim for an additional percentage of 33j- per cent.The Board would be glad if Their Lordships would consider the proposals now madein substitution for an arrangement which, though it seemed fair at the time, may becomevery difficult to work on, and should any further information be desired by Their Lordshipsit is suggested that it could be most conveniently furnished at a meeting with representativesof the Railway Companies and of this Department.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,-    (Signed) W.F.

(Enclosure No. 1 in Board of Trade letter of 3rd May, 1917.)F. 188.North Eastern Railway,4, Cowley Street, Westminster, S.W.3rd April, 1917.G.Dear Sir,Arrears of Maintenance.Referring to our conversation on the 28th ultimo, I have seen Sir Thomas Heathand explained to him the nature of the proposal that has been made, and he expressedthe view that the matter was one in the first instance for the Board of Trade, and notfor the Treasury, and suggested that I should communicate with you.The proposal, as I explained, is that instead of fixing a new percentage in place ofthe 12J per cent, which should govern the payments in respect of the year 1916, one per-centage should be made to govern the whole period of control, and all payments madeduring that period should be treated as payments on account.As you will be aware, it was arranged that the 12J per cent should be revised after31st December, 1915, and the Companies have asked that 33% per cent, may be substitutedfor the 12^ per cent. The question has been raised whether the revision of the 12^ per cent,will be retrospective that is to say, will apply to 1914 and 1915, or whether the arrearsof those years are to be treated as a closed transaction. Whatever the intention mayhave been when the 12J per cent, was fixed, it seems a curious arrangement that differentpercentages should be applied to different parts of the works executed after the periodof control, and it would not in point of fact be possible to earmark the arrears referableto the different years of the control. Not only so, but if any of the arrears are overtakenduring the period of control (and if the control continues after the war, this might veryeasily be the case) it seems impossible to devise any means for applying the correct per-centage to the cost of such work. It has therefore been suggested that instead of revisingthe percentage year by year, the better plan would be to treat all payments made duringthe period of control as payments on account, and, when the control comes to an end,to fix a percentage for all the arrears, which shall be fair, having regard to the period overwhich the execution of the works of deferred maintenance is likely to extend and theprobable trend of prices during such period.The only practicable alternative would seem to be to agree on a percentage now onceand for all, each side taking the chance of the figure being above or below the prices prevail-ing or likely to prevail after the war. This would have the advantage of avoiding furtherquestion, but it would in effect be little more than a gamble, and probably great difficultywould be experienced in coming to an agreement on such lines. Moreover, it must beborne in mind that as regards arrears outside Abstracts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B,&quot; it will be necessaryto agree some percentage or schedule of prices after the period of control, and thereought not, one would think, to be any greater difficulty in doing this for the arrearsfalling within those abstracts.As regards the existing arrangement, I suggest that there is not much object in con-sidering whether or not it was intended to treat each year of the control as a separatebargain and a closed transaction, because apart from the practical difficulties, it is notclear that this course would be to the advantage of the Government. Suppose the pricesfor 1916 were ascertained to be 33J per cent, above pre-war prices and those for 1917twice that figure, it might well be that those prices would be considerably higher thanthose prevailing or likely to prevail when the control comes to an end.When you have had an opportunity of considering the matter, Mr. Thornton and I willbe pleased to discuss it with you.Yours faithfully,(Signed) A. KAYE BUTTERWORTH.W. F. Marwood, Esq.,Board of Trade.
(Enclosure No. 2 w Board of Trade letter of 3rd May, 1917.)Messrs. Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co.,3, Frederick&apos;s Place,Old Jewry, London, E.C.[&apos;i     12th April, 1917.Bear Mr. Marwood,Arrears of Maintenance.As desired by you I have considered the proposal upon this subject contained inSir A. Kaye Butterworth&apos;s letter of the 3rd inst., of which you sent me a copy.I believe that it is clear from the Minutes of the proceedings, which took place whenthe arrangement for making good arrears of maintenance was made with the RailwayCompanies, that it was intended that the amounts at which the claims in respect of a yearwere agreed should be regarded as definitely fixing the claims for that year. If this is so,it follows that any revision of the allowance for increased costs made in respect of thearrears accruing in 1916 would not affect the allowance already agreed upon for 1914and 1915, the claims for those years being regarded as definitely ascertained.The arrangement was no doubt of the nature of a compromise, as it does not seema necessary part of such an arrangement that the Government should pay forthwith forwork which would not be carried out until some indefinite time in the future, and thisbeing so, it might well be regarded as a part of the compromise that the Railways shouldaccept as compensation for any increased costs they might be put to when they cameto carry out the work, a sum based upon the increases in the prices of materials and the ratesof wages ruling at the time when the claims accrued.It is possible that when the terms of this compromise were agreed upon, it was notforeseen that the war and consequently the period of control would be so prolonged, and itmay be that it would be better to revise the terms of the arrangement, so as to defer untilafter the war the definite fixing of the allowance for increased costs.This is the course which is suggested by Sir A. Kaye Rutterworth on behalf of theRailways, on the ground, as I understand it, partly that the present arrangement un-avoidably contains an element of speculation and partly on the ground of practicaldifficulties in working.I do not think that there is any objection from the Government^ point of view tosuch a modification of the arrangement, as it is scarcely possible to foresee how pricesand wages after the war will compare with those ruling during the period of control, althoughit may be surmised that the 12^ per cent, allowed for 1914 and 1915 is not likely to coverthe increased costs of carrying out after the war the arrears which accrued in those years.If, however, the Government, upon the request of the Railways, consents to sucha revision of the existing arrangement, it may be advisable to reconsider also that partof the plan which provides for the immediate payment to the railways of sums whichthey will not have to disburse until some time hence, which at the present high rate ofinterest represents a valuable concession. Even if it be agreed to continue the presentsystem of current payment for arrears, the payment of any allowance for increased costsmight be allowed to stand over till after the war, when it is definitely fixed, or at all eventsthe payment, if continued, might be calculated at a moderate rate, say 12J per cent.If I can be of service, I shall be pleased to attend the meeting which Sir A. KayeButterworth suggests that Mr. Thornton and himself should have with you to discuss thesubject.Yours very truly,.(Signed)  ALBERT W. WYON.W. F.

Wi fillF. 188.14742/17.Treasury Chambers.1st June, 1917.Sir,I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury Mr. Marwood&apos;sletter of the 3rd ultimo (R. 638) and the enclosed copy of correspondence on the subject ofthe amount to be paid to the Railway Companies in respect of arrears of repair and renewalof rolling stock.
In reply I am to request you to inform the Board of Trade that in Their Lordshipsopinion it is desirable that the matter should &quot;be discussed at a conference betweenrepresentatives of the Companies and of your Department and this Department, and Theywill be glad if the Board will make arrangements accordingly.. I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) T. L. HEATH.The Secretary,Board of Trade.(52)F. 188.20441/17.*  Treasury Chambers.2Qth June, 1917.Sir,1. The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury have given further considerationto Sir William Marwood&apos;s letter of the 3rd ultimo (R. 638) which, as the Board are aware,was discussed at a conference held on the 19th instant at the Board of Trade withrepresentatives of the Railway Executive Committee.2. The arrears of repairs and renewals of rolling stock and permanent way accruingdue in any year are represented by the difference between the agreed pre-war standardfigure, adjusted for any extension of mileage, etc., less the cost at pre-war prices of theworks actually carried out in the year and charged to working expenses.If the pre-war value of the work so carried out in any year exceeds the standardfigure, the amount of such excess is due to be repaid by the Company concerned out ofthe amount received by way of arrears for previous years, together with the appropriatepercentage on such excess.3. The arrears for the period 4th August, 1914, to 31st December, 1915, as determinedin the previous paragraph, have been paid by the Board to the Railway Executive Com-mittee, with an addition of 12J per cent, to represent the enhanced cost, as comparedwith 1913 prices, of carrying out the deferred works, and My Lords had understood thispayment to represent a definite bargain, not open to subsequent adjustment.4. The Railway Executive Committee now represent that, if similar arrangementsare to be continued, the percentage addition for 1916 will be 33^ per cent., while a materiallyhigher figure will apply for 1917. Inasmuch as it is impossible to forecast when or at whatprices the works will be carried out, the propriety of any given percentage must be highlyspeculative,5. In view of these considerations, My Lords will not refuse to reopen the questionas from the commencement of the control, and to regard all the payments made up todate, including those in respect of 1914 and 1915, as payments on account. The totalsum payable to the Companies after the control period will therefore be the total arrears,as determined under paragraph 2, plus a percentage representing increase of cost at thedate of execution of the works as compared with 1913, less the sums already paid on account.6. For obvious reasons My Lords would have preferred to make no further paymentson account, deferring settlement until the Companies were themselves called upon todefray the expenditure. The Companies have no alternative but to invest the moneypaid to them on account; and the interest on such investments is credited to a GeneralInterest Account &quot;below the line&quot; and not to Revenue, so as to reduce the compensationpayable under the guarantee.7. My Lords are, however, satisfied that the claim of the Companies to this interestcannot be lightly dismissed. While it is true that increased running expenses, due topostponement of repairs, etc., fall upon the Exchequer through the operation of theGuarantee, the increased amount of repairs, due to progressive deterioration and employ-ment of rolling stock which would normally have been scrapped, falls upon the Companies,the ^compensation for arrears being based upon the 1913 standard. Further, someappreciable period must necessarily elapse between the time that the Companies actuallymeet their current payments for working expenses or special works for Government depart-ments and the time they receive repayment (in the monthly advance of compensationor otherwise); and the cost of providing working capital during that interval is not charge-able against the Exchequer.
8. After full consideration My Lords feel it would be inequitable, if not indeedimpolitic, to cease making payments on account of arrears. Their Lordships, however,do not see Their way to making payments on account to so large an amount as the RailwayExecutive Committee suggests; but They authorise you to inform that Committee that Theyare prepared to sanction the following arrangements viz., that such payments should, asfrom 1st January, 1916, be at the rate of 115 per cent, of the arrears, calculated in themanner described in paragraph 2 of this letter. In the revision of the percentage for thepurpose of the final settlement it will be necessary, as represented in Sir AlexanderButterworth&apos;s letter of 3rd April, to have regard to the period over which the executionof the deferred works is likely to extend and the probable trend of prices during such period.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) ROBERT CHALMERS.The Secretary,Board of Trade.(53)R. 638.F.J188.Board of Trade.3rd July 1917.Sir,With reference to previous, correspondence and to the recent meeting at this Officeon the subject of the payment to be made to the controlled Railway Companies in respectof arrears of repair and renewal of rolling stock and permanent way, I am directed by theBoard of Trade to transmit herewith for the information and observations of the RailwayExecutive Committee, a copy of a letter which has been received from the Treasury in thematter.As will be observed, there is a slight misstatement in paragraph 3 of the Treasuryletter.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)  GARNHAM ROPER.The Acting Chairman,Railway Executive Committee.(Treasury letter of 26 June, 1917, enclosed, Document No. 52.)(54)E. 188.Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.30th August, 1917.Arrears of Maintenance.1. The letter from the Treasury of the 26th June which you forwarded to me on the3rd July has been carefully considered by the Railway Executive Committee, and I aminstructed to say that they are prepared to accept, as a settlement of their applicationfor an increased percentage in respect of the enhanced cost of carrying out deferred worksof Maintenance (Abstracts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot;) the arrangement outlined in paragraphs 5and 8 of the Treasury letter viz., (1) that payments as from the commencement of thecontrol period are to be regarded as payments on account, and (2) that they are to beat the rate of 115 per cent, of the arrears. This is subject to a correct ascertainment ofthe arrears, the method of arriving at which is not, the Committee submit, accurately setout in paragraph 2 of the Treasury letter.2. The question of adjusting &quot; excess &quot; expenditure in those cases where a Companyhas arrears in one period and an excess in another is not free from difficulty, and theP. 192/6.Sir,
Railway Executive Committee think it would be well for the Accountants&apos; Sub-Committeeto get into touch with Mr. Wyon as soon as possible with the object of agreeing upon apractical method of giving effect to the arrangement proposed.3. The Committee are not clear as to the object the Board of Trade had in view inasking for their observations upon the letter of the Treasury, which, apart from the definiteoffer contained in it, consists in part of a statement of the existing position, and in partof an explanation of the reasons why, in the view of the Treasury, the proposals of theRailway Companies should be accorded favourable consideration. It is not apparentwhy these matters should have been introduced in connection with the present proposals..4. You will remember that the only questions under considerations were (a) to determine the increased percentage in respect of the enhanced cost of carryingout deferred works of maintenance, and(b) the period which these payments should cover.With regard to (a) the principle of paying an amount currently in respect of deferredmaintenance had been previously agreed, and the considerations referred to in Treasuryletter as affecting the question of interest, so far as they were relevant, had no doubt alreadybeen taken into account.In the case of (b) a percentage was arrived at based on the average prices currentduring the period from the commencement of the war to the end of 1915, leaving furtherpercentages to be agreed subsequently for each year.5. As it was obvious that such an arrangement would be unfair to the Government ifat the end of control prices were lower than the amount due plus percentage, and to theCompanies if they were higher, it was suggested that the payment for the whole periodshould be on account and adjusted at the end of control to the prices at which it seemedlikely that deferred work could be carried out, it being an essential part of the arrangementwith th 3 Government under which the Railways are being worked that the Companies areentitled to have their property restored to them in no worse condition than when it wastaken over.6. As you invite the observations of the Committee upon the letter of the Treasuryand as that letter lays down, expressly or by implication, a number of propositions whichthe Committee are unable to accept as accurate, they have prepared a memorandumsetting out the main features of the position, as they understand it, in relation to thematters referred to in the letter, and I am directed to enclose you a copy.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,[Signed) H. A. WALKER,Acting Chairman.The Assistant Secretary,Board of Trade(Railway Department).(Enclosure in Railway Executive Committee letter of 30th August, 1917.)Arrears op Maintenance.Memorandum with reference to the letter of the Treasury to the Board of Trade, dated26th June, 1917.Clause 2 (Paragraphs 1 and 2). The Committee cannot accept this clause as settingout accurately the arrangements at present in force, with which it can readily be compared.Eor example, any adjustment for additional mileage, &amp;c, is made not in the 1913 figures,but in the figures of the period under review, and the word &quot; less &quot; in line 4 is obviouslyan error.What is more important is that the paragraphs make no reference to the fact thatseparate claims for arrears have to be made by each Company in respect of PermanentWay and Rolling Stock (Abstracts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; of the Railway Companies&apos; Accounts),and that there is no set-off as between the two Abstracts (see clause 2 of the printed In-structions). Further the paragraphs are silent as to those cases in which a period ofarrears is preceded by a period of excess, and in which, as the existing arrangement isunderstood by the Companies, the Government are entitled to insist on a set-off no lessthan when the arrears precede the excess.
Clause 3. The Treasury have evidently overlooked the fact that the Companieshave at present only received 85 per cent, of the arrears for the period 4th August, 1914,to 31st December, 1915.Clause 5. It was agreed at the Meeting held at the Board of Trade on the 25th Aprillast that it was desirable that the final percentage should be agreed or settled within,at the latest, twelve months after the termination of the period of Government control,and the Accounts adjusted accordingly. As the clause stands it might be taken to implythat the final percentage is not to be settled until the works of maintenance are actuallycarried out, which would not be a practicable procedure.Clause 6. The final sentence of this clause is not quite clear. It would be free fromambiguity if the words &quot; and therefore does not&quot; were substituted for the words &quot; so asto,&quot; and this no doubt is the meaning.Clause 7. Raises the questions of progressive deterioration and loss of interest,which are only indirectly connected with the matter under negotiation at the presentmoment. As to the latter, it is noted that the Treasury recognise the fact that the systemof monthly payments on account of compensation involves cost to the Companies in theprovision of working capital, and apparently wish it to be recorded that they regard thatfact as affording a reason for continuing the system of monthly payments on account ofarrears of maintenance. The Committee in no way dissent from this view, but theywould point out that if any attempt were made to strike a debit and credit balance of interest,many other items would have to be brought into account for example, the large additionsto working capital rendered necessary by the increased prices of materials, the loss of interestfrom which in the case of a single Company is estimated to amount to something like  50,000per annum. Indeed, it has always been the view of the Companies&apos; Accountants that theitems of interest lost to the Companies are amply sufficient to counterbalance the interestwhich accrues to them by reason of the system of monthly payments on account of arrearsof maintenance. However that may be, the Committee cannot agree that in any suchcalculation of interest anything would have to be brought into account, as seems to besuggested in the letter of the Treasury, in respect of payment for special works executedby the Companies for a Government Department. The right of the Companies to befinanced by the Government when they are asked to carry out such works, either throughtheir shops or through their Engineering Department, has already been recognised, andalthough the number and magnitude of such works have diminished, it is important thatthe principle should not be lost sight of.There remain the questions arising in connection with progressive deterioration andcognate matters, as to which the Treasury state that &quot; the increased amount of repairsdue to progressive deterioration and employment of rolling stock which would normallyhave been scrapped falls upon the Companies.&quot; It is not altogether clear what the words&quot; progressive deterioration &quot; are intended to cover; but the sentence seems capableof bearing an interpretation which would certainly not be fair to the Companies, nor,it is submitted, in accordance with the spirit of the existing arrangements. It has on anumber of occasions been pointed out that in many cases the amount by which -the workdone in a year of the control falls short of the work done in 1913 by no means representsthe total loss to the Company, because if repairs are unduly deferred, damage is incurredin a more than corresponding degree. It is sufficient to draw attention to the referencemade to this point in the Memorandum submitted to the late Lord Kitchener by theRailway Executive Committee as far back as May, 1915 ; but it should be borne in mindthat the seriousness of the point has been enormously increased since that date, partlyby the mere effluxion of time and partly from the difficulty (in many cases the impossibility)of obtaining materials, due in large measure to the restrictions imposed by the action ofthe Government itself.Apart from this feature of loss there are many cases where work has to be carriedout by a Company under war conditions, the cost of which by&quot;its inclusion in workingexpenses diminishes the Company&apos;s claim for arrears of maintenance, while the benefitderived by the Company from such work may be almost nil, or at any rate, is not fairlyrepresente 1 by the cost. Patch-work repairs to rolling stock which in normal timeswould be scrapped-the case referred to in the Treasury letter-is an instance of this.The use of uncreosoted sleepers is another.Different Companies are affected by these matters in different degrees, and it doesnot seem to the Committee that they can be fairly ruled out of consideration when thefinal settlement with the Government is made. It must be borne in mind that the existingarrangement contains special provision with reference to abnormal wear and tear, whichwould probably meet most of the cases of hardship which would undoubtedly arise if the
Treasury letter were to be read in a rigid sense, although it has not yet been found possibleto devise any satisfactory formula which will meet all cases. It ought to be clearly under-stood that these provisions are in no way affected by the present proposal. The letter ofthe Treasury makes it necessary to draw attention to the point, because not only doesthat letter make no reference to these provisions, but it seems to suggest that the gainto the Companies in interest arising from payments on account of arrears of maintenanceis sufficient not only to wipe out the loss of interest in other matters, but to cover theindirect losses incurred by a Company, partly from doing repairs which in the circumstancesthat have arisen must be done, though they are of little ultimate advantage, and partlyfrom undue postponement of repairs, which ought to be done at once, but for which thematerials or labour are not forthcoming. Such a conclusion would be entirely at variancewith what the Committee believe to be the actual facts.Clause 8.-The Committee accept the proposal made by the Treasury, subject to theforegoing observations with reference to Clause 2. With reference to the last sentenceoi the clause, the Committee agree generally with what is said in the letter of Sir AlexanderButterworth referred to as to the matters to be taken in consideration in fixing the finalpercentage, but they consider that unless it is found possible to deal satisfactorily withthe matters raised in Clause 7 of the Treasury letter under the provisions above referredto, these matters may have to be taken into consideration in fixing the percentage, assuggested in the Memorandum to the late Lord Kitchener.(55)F. 188.A/cs. 45/Z. 192/6.Railway Executive Committee,16, Great George Street, Westminster, S.W.$th May, 1918.Dear Sir,Arrears of Maintenance.With reference to the meeting held here on the 30th ultimo, which was attended bySir Alexander Butterworth and Mr. Isaac on behalf of the Railway Executive Committee,I am desired to send you, for submission to the Treasury, a copy of the Memorandumwhich was discussed at the meeting. The Committee wish it to be clearly understoodthat they are not pressing the point with regard to the ante-dating of the 15 per cent, onaccount of any pecuniary advantage accruing to the Companies from such ante-dating,but simply to avoid the complications and possible misunderstandings which the Accoun-tants foresee if the Companies have to be instructed to calculate the Arrears of Maintenanceat varying rates for different periods of the control.I am desired to say that it is hoped that it may be possible to give an early decisionupon the point, as the accounts for the Arrears of Maintenance, and the necessary in-structions. with regard to their preparation, are necessarily being held up until this pointhas been disposed of.Yours faithfully,(Signed)  H. A. WALKER,Acting Chairman, Executive Committee.The Assistant Secretary(Railway Department),Board of Trade,Whitehall, S.W.(Enclosure in Railway Executive Committee letter of 8th May, 1918.)Arrears of Maintenance and Renewal Work.Abstracts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B.&quot;Memorandum in regard to Treasury suggestion that the payments on account of Arrearsshould le at the rate of 112J per cent, for the period 5th August, 1914, to Slst December,1915, and at the rate of 115 per cent, subsequently.1. For the purpose of obtaining payments on account of Arrears of Maintenance, aformula was agreed with H.M. Government for comparing at the end of each year the
amount of the expenditure of that year after agreed adjustments in respect of increasedprices, &amp;c, had been effected with the corresponding charge in 1913. Should this com-parison reveal a shortage in the control period, such shortage is treated as Arrears ; shouldan excess be shown, such excess falls to be deducted from any previous or subsequentArrears.2. It is suggested that although independent calculations are made in respect of eachyear, the Arrears produced by the respective calculations must not be regarded asrepresenting the true Arrears accrued during such year, and that the control period as awhole must be treated, as one. This is, of course, quite clear where an &quot; Excess &quot; is pro-duced, say, in 1916, as against an &quot; Arrears &quot; in 1915, the true Arrears at the end of 1916being the amount (if any) by which the Arrears to the end of 1915 exceed the &quot; Excess &quot;for 1916. Similarly in the case of a Company showing Arrears for each period to theend of 1916, the amount of Arrears as at the end of the latter year is the total of the threestatements (1914,1915 and 1916), the total amount having in practically all cases accruedduring the last year viz.,1916--for the reason that the Company would obviously carryout Arrears of 1914-1915 work before undertaking that relating to 1916.3. For this reason it is argued that it is illogical to deal with the separate periods ofcontrol as subject to different percentages. The aggregate Arrears at any one date by theirnature relate to the work which should have been done during the latest period, and allCompanies should receive payment therefore on the same basis. For example, threeCompanies &quot; A,&quot; &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; have Arrears at 31st December, 1916, of  500,000 madeup from the Arrears statements for each period as follows :-191419.151916&quot;A.&quot; Arrears 100,000Arrears 500,000Excess 100,000 500,000&quot;B.&quot; Arrears 200,000Arrears 100,000Arrears 200,000 500,000 Arrears 50,000Arrears 50,000Arrears 400,000 500,000The payments made to the three Companies if the percentage is changed at December, 1915,would vary, however, as under: -&quot;A.&quot; &quot;B.&quot; &quot;C.&quot; 562,500  567,500 -     572,5004. Further, if the percentage is varied, a question will arise in 1917 and subsequentlyas to which prior period any excess work relates, a different result being produced accordingto whether such excess is regarded as relating to 1914-1915 or the subsequent period.This question has so far not been discussed, and instructions would have to be drawn upand the formula at present agreed would have to be amended, to provide for whateversettlement was agreed upon. The instructions and the formula, however, are sufficientlycomplicated at present, and apart from any other consideration, it is suggested a constantpercentage should be adopted to avoid the confusion and inconvenience which would other-wise arise in dealing with the 79 controlled Companies.5. The first paragraph of the Executive Committee&apos;s letter to the Board of Tradedated 30th August, 1917, read as follows : &quot; The letter from the Treasury of the 26th June which you forwarded to me on 3rdJuly has been carefully considered by the Railway Executive Committee, .and Iam instructed to say that they are prepared to accept, as a settlement of theirapplication for an increased percentage in respect of the enhanced cost of carryingout deferred works of maintenance (Abstracts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot;), the arrangementoutlined in paragraphs 5 and 8 of the Treasury letter,-viz., (1) that paymentsas from the commencement of the control period are to be regarded as paymentson account, and (2) that they are to be at the rate of 115 per cent, of the arrears.This is subject to a correct ascertainment of the arrears, the method of arriving atwhich is not, the Committee&apos;submit, accurately set out in paragraph 2 of theTreasury letter.&quot;It is clear from this that the Executive Committee understood that the paymentsas from the commencement of the control period should be at the rate of 115 per cent, ofthe A rears.

(64)RAILWAY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.Arrears of Maintenance and Renewal Work.Abstracts &quot;-A,&quot; &quot; B &quot; (1), (2) and (3).Issued to the Railway Companies on 25th January, 1916, and known as the YELLOW BOOK.General1. The Executive Committee have obtained the assent of the Government to the in-clusion in the monthly estimate of Revenue Receipts and Expenditure of an amount inrespect of the ultimate cost of carrying out the arrears of repairs and renewals arising duringthe Government control period, so far as Abstracts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; are concerned. TheGovernment have further agreed that for the control period from 5th August to 31stDecember, 1914, and for the year 1915, an addition of 12J per cent, may be made to thearrears, arrived at as set out in these Instructions, to cover increased outlay which may haveto be incurred when the arrears of work are ultimately carried out.Basis of the Claim.2. Separate claims for arrears must be made in respect of Abstract &quot; A &quot; and Abstract&quot; B,&quot; but the three sections (1), (2j and (3) of Abstract &quot; B &quot; are to be treated as &quot;oneAbstract and dealt with as a whole. Each claim must be based on the amount by which theexpenditure in the Government control period falls short of the total of the Abstract for thecorresponding period of 1913, after making allowance for (i) the difference between ratesof wages and between prices of materials in the two periods, (ii) any increased cost due toadditional length of line opened or additions to rolling stock in service, and (iii) any addi-tional expenditure incurred during the period of Government control as the result of abnor-mal wear and tear during such period.Charges between Companies.3. With reference to Executive Committee Instruction No. 32 suspending chargesbetween Companies : in order to make the control period comparable with the correspondingperiod of 1913, Companies have been authorised by Circular Letters Nos. 409 and 456, toraise certain charges against other Companies as from 5th August, 1914, for (a) expenditureincurred in the repairs and renewal of Joint Lines, Stations jointly used and Junctions,chargeable to Abstract &quot; A,&quot; (&amp;) expenditure incurred in the repairs and renewals of jointrolling stock, and (c) expenditure incurred in the maintenance of other Companies&apos; rollingstock, etc.Formula for arriving at Claims.4. The rules to be observed in making up claims are set out below (a) to (i), and in theAppendix hereto will be found formulae showing in detail the manner of arriving at the arrearsof work, which must be closely followed. Those Companies whose circumstances renderit necessary for them to make a claim under &quot; B &quot; (1), (2) and (3), must do so for the threesections as a whole, and the expenditure in the control period in the separate sections,arrived at as indicated in the formula, must be added together and placed in relation&apos;to thetotal of the three sections of Abstract &quot; B &quot; for the corresponding period of 1913.Expenditure during Control Period.(a) The actual expenditure incurred in the control period under all the headings in theAbstracts arrived at in accordance with the Memorandum of Instructions, butexclusive of the transfer to (or from) Depreciation Fund or Suspense Account,and of the item &quot; Engine Power supplied to and by the Company (Balance) &quot;in the case of &quot;! B &quot; (1), is to be the commencing figure in each formula.Renewal Expenditure in Excess of Programme.(b) Those Companies whose practice is to provide for renewal work on a fixed basis orannual programme and whose expenditure in the control period in respect ofsuch renewal work is, after making allowance for the circumstances mentionedin Clause 2, in excess of the charge (whether expended or not) made for thecorresponding period of 1913, must deduct the amount of such excess from thetotal expenditure, such excess being chargeable against the Depreciation Fundor Suspense Account as the case may be.Credits for Supervision, &amp;c.   War Manufactures, &amp;c, Accounts.(c) Any credits for (a) supervision charged to the Government in respect of WarManufactures, etc., and (6) supervision and profit charged to Armament Firms,must be added to the expenditure.
Expenditure on Government Work charged to Revenue Expenditure.(d) Any amounts included in the revenue expenditure for work done for the Govem-ment--e.g., &quot; sundry small works for the Government&quot; (vide Instruction No.294); special alterations, etc., to rolling stock necessary for the purpose ofconveying Naval and Military Traffic, etc., must be deducted therefrom.New Lines opened and Additions to Rolling Stock in Service.(e) The amount presumed to be included in the expenditure during the control periodin respect of repairs and renewals of additional length of line or additions torolling stock in service, as compared with the year 1913 (and; therefore, to bededucted from such, expenditure in comparing it with the expenditure of thecorresponding period of 1913 for the purpose of determining the arrears ofmaintenance in terms of money), is to be arrived at as follows :-.....(i) Renewals. In the case of &quot;Programme Companies&quot;-?&apos;.e., Companies whoprovide for renewals (complete or partial) on a fixed basis-the amountmust be calculated in accordance with the usual practice of the Companies,increased by a percentage to bring it up to 1915 rates of wages and pricesof materials ; in the case of other Companies, no deduction is to be made.(ii) Repairs. In the case of &quot; Programme Companies &quot; who provide on a fixedbasis for repairs as well as renewals, the amount must be calculated inaccordance with the usual practice of the Companies, increased by a per-centage to bring it up to 1915 rates of wages and prices of materials. Inthe case of Companies who do not provide for repairs on a fixed basis,the amount is to be based upon the unit cost of repairs for the year 1913.The unit cost of repairs to be arrived at by dividing the expenditureshown under the undermentioned headings in the published Accounts forthe year 1913 (increased by a percentage to bring it up to 1915 rates ofwages and prices of materials), by the number of the relative&apos;units asgiven in the Statistical Returns for that year, and such unit costs are to bemultiplied by the number of additional units in each case.Abstract &quot; A.&quot;Repairs of Running Lines and Sidings 1   Unit^per si  ,  mik of TrackMaintenance ol Signalling y -   , ,.B  0.,.Ti/r - x. t m i      v including Sidings.Maintenance oi Telegraphs J &amp;      &amp;Abstract &quot; B.&quot;(1) Locomotives.Repairs and Partial Renewals       Unit-Per Locomotive.(2) Carriages.Repairs and Partial Renewals       Unit Per Coaching Vehicle.(3) Wagons.Repairs and Partial Renewals       Unit Per Merchandise and Min-eral Vehicle.In the case of a &quot; Programme Company &quot; whose programme covers partialas well as complete renewals, the unit cost of repairs must be reduced by elimi-nating from the 1913 expenditure the amounts expended on partial renewals.Additional Expenditure for Abnormal Wear and Tear.(f) Any amount included in the expenditure, representing additional costs incurred.   as the result of abnormal wear and tear to which the permanent way or rollingstock of a Company has been subjected during the control period, should bededucted from such expenditure. Owing to the varying circumstances of theCompanies, it is impossible to stereotype a method for arriving at the deductionsreferred to in this paragraph. Each Company, therefore, who makes such adeduction will be required to produce sufficient evidence, accompanied by areport from the Chief Executive Officer concerned, to satisfy the GovernmentAuditor that the abnormal wear and tear so deducted has taken place, and thatthe expenditure has been incurred during the control period in making thesame good.Allowance for Increased Rates of Wages and Prices of Materials.(g) The deduction from the expenditure in the control period in order to make allow-ance for the difference between rates of wages and between prices of materialsin the two periods is to be arrived at in the following manner, the year 1915being taken as an example : Wages. The rates of wages paid in 1915 to the grades of employeesengaged in maintenance and renewal work to be put in relation to the rates of
wages paid in the year 1913, and the difference expressed in terms of a percentageon the 1915 rates ; such percentage to be applied to the total amount of wagespaid in the year 1915 in connection with Abstract &quot; A &quot; and Abstract &quot; B &quot;separately (the three sections of Abstract &quot; B &quot; being also separately dealt with),and the 1915 figures so modified will be the wages cost of work carried out in1915 at the 1913 rates of wages. In cases where there is a considerable variationin the rate of increase in wages charged under the respective heading in Abstract&quot;A,&quot; due regard to be had to the relation between the amount of the wagesincluded under each heading and the gross total of the wages embraced in theAbstract, in arriving at the percentage increase on the total figures.(Note. The expression &quot; Rates of Wages &quot; covers War Bonus Payments includedin the various abstracts, increase in Piece-Work rates, extra payments forOvertime, and any other factor which has increased the cost of labour.)Materials. In order to avoid the trouble of calculating the whole ofthe materials used in 1915 at 1913 prices, not less than 80 per cent, in value ofthe materials used in 1915 shall be so calculated and the difference betweenthe amount thus arrived at and the actual charge in 1915 for those materials tobe expressed as a percentage of the latter figure ; such percentage to bededucted from the cost of all materials used in 1915, in connection withAbstract &quot;A&quot; and Abstract &quot; B &quot; separately (the three sections of Abstract&quot; B &quot; being also separately dealt with). This will give the cost at 1913 pricesof materials used in maintenance and renewal work carried out in 1915.Wages and Materials combined. The difference between the cost ofwages in 1915 at 1913 rates of wages, and the cost of materials in 1915 at1913 issue prices, when added together and applied to the actual cost ofwages and materials combined in 1915 will give the percentage which is tobe applied to the total amount of the particular Abstract or section of Abstract.(Note. In the case of rolling stock purchased in 1915, in replacement of othervehicles which under ordinary circumstances would have been built in theCompany&apos;s workshops, the additional cost arising from that circumstancewill not be represented by the percentage arrived at as indicated above, andshould be the subject of a separate deduction from the 1915 figures in arrivingat the 1915 expenditure as compared with the 1913 expenditure.)Abstract Totals for Corresponding Periods of 1913.(h) 5th August to 31st December, 1913.-The totals of the Abstracts for the half-year ended 31st December, 1913, shown in the &quot; Statement of Revenue Receiptsand Expenditure for the half-years ended 31st December, 1914, and 31st Decem-ber, 1913,&quot; prepared in accordance with Instruction No. 236, exclusive of theitem &quot; Engine Power supplied to and by the Company (balance) &quot; in the caseof &quot; B &quot; (1) is to be apportioned to the periods July 1st to 4th August and 5thAugust to 31st December, in ratio to the Total Traffic Receipts of those periodsfor the purpose of arriving at the Abstract total to be placed in relation to theexpenditure (as adjusted) of the control period in 1914.Year, 1913.-The total of the Abstracts for the year 1913, as shown in thepublished Accounts, exclusive of the Engine Power item in &quot; B &quot; (1) is to beplaced in relation to the expenditure (as adjusted) of the year 1915.Renewal Expenditure less than Provisions.(i) Those Companies who provide for renewals on a fixed basis, and whose expendi-ture for the control period is less than the amount chargeable for that period,will have debited or will debit the amount so unexpended to the respectiveAbstracts under the heading &quot; Transfer to Depreciation Eund or SuspenseAccount.&quot; The unexpended amounts so charged must therefore be deductedfrom the &quot; Amount chargeable for Arrears of Work.&quot;Manner of Obtaining Payments on Account of Claims.5. As indicated in Clause 1, the Government have expressed their willingness to makemonthly payments on account of the arrears of maintenance and renewal work as part ofthe monthly estimated deficiencies. Each Company, therefore, whose circumstancesrender it necessary for them to make a claim under these Instructions should take steps,as soon as the adjustment of the charges referred to under Clause 3 has been effected, toprepare the necessary information for the purpose of arriving at the Claim or Claims for theperiod to 31st December, 1914, and for the year 1915 (regard being had to the provisions ofthe following Clause 6), and include such amounts as separate items in the monthly Estimateof Revenue Receipts and Expenditure under the following headings viz.: &quot; Maintenance
and Renewal of Way and Works Arrears,&quot; and/or &quot; Maintenance and Renewal of RollingStock Arrears.&quot;Submission of Final Claims.6. The Claims made under these Instructions for the period 5th August to 31st Decem-ber, 1914, and for the year 1915, should in their final form be submitted as part of theClaim for compensation for the year 1915, and an Instruction will be issued at a later datesetting out the precise form of the Claim and the information it will be necessary tofurnish in proof of the increased rates of wages and prices of materials.It must be noted that any Company making a Claim for Arrears of Work under theseInstructions for either period must render statements compiled on the methods set out hereinfor both periods, and the final Claim will only be admitted in respect of the balance ofArrears of Work disclosed by the two statements. Those Companies therefore making aClaim under these Instructions in respect of either Abstract for the period 5th Augustto 31st December, 1914, must reduce the amount claimed in respect of that period by theamount by which the expenditure in that Abstract in the year 1915 (after being adjustedas provided in this Instruction) may exceed the total of the Abstract for the year 1913.Similarly, those Companies making a Claim under these Instructions for the year 1915 mustreduce the amount claimed in respect of that year by the amount by which the expenditurein the corresponding Abstract or Abstracts in the period 5th August to 31st December, 1914(after being adjusted as provided in this Instruction), may exceed the total of the respectiveAbstract or Abstracts for the corresponding period of 1913.Abnormal Wear and Tear.7. It should be noted that the Claims-to be made under these Instructions do nottake into account the abnormal wear and tear to which the permanent way and rollingstock of certain Companies may have been subjected during the control period, so far assuch abnormal wear and tear has not been made good during that period, and that anyCompany who is in a position to substantiate a claim under this head should make its Claimindependently of the Claims submitted for Arrears of Work.25th January, 1916.Appendix (vide Clause 4).FORMULA FOR ARRIVING AT ARREARS OF MAINTENANCE AND RENEWAL OF WAY ANDWORKS FOR THE PERIOD 5th AUGUST, 1914, TO 31st DECEMBER, 1915.See Clause 4 of Abstract &quot; A.&quot;  (Taking year 1915 as an example.)Instruction-Section.

(70)Arrears of Maintenance and Renewal Work.Abstracts &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; (1), (2) and (3).Issued to the Railway Companies on 13th December, 1918, and known as the BROWN BOOK.General.1. The Executive Committee have obtained the assent of the Government to paymentson account in respect of the ultimate cost of carrying out the arrears of repairs and renewalsarising during the Government control period, so far as Abstracts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; areconcerned. The Government have further agreed that an addition of 15 per cent, maybe made to the Arrears, arrived at as set out in these Instructions, on account of theincreased outlay which may have to be incurred when the arrears of work are ultimatelycarried out.Basis of the Claim.2. Separate claims for arrears must be made in respect of Abstract &quot; A &quot; and Abstract&quot;B,&quot;but the three sections (1),(2) and (3) of Abstract &quot;B&quot; are to be treated as one Abstractand dealt with as a whole. Each claim must be based on the amount by which theexpenditure in the Government control period falls short of the total of the Abstract forthe year 1913, after making such allowances as are provided for in these Instructions.Formula? for arriving at Claims.3. The rules to be observed in making up claims are set out herein (Clauses 4 to 25),and in the Appendix hereto will be found formulae showing in detail the manner of arrivingat the arrears of work. Those Companies whose circumstances render it necessary forthem to make a claim under &quot; B &quot; (1), (2) and (3), must do so for the three sections as a whole,and the expenditure in the control period in the separate sections, arrived at as indicatedin the formula, must be added together and placed in relation to the total of the threesections of Abstract &quot; B &quot; for the year 1913.Expenditure during Control Period.4. The actual expenditure incurred under all the headings in the Abstracts arrivedat in accordance with the Memorandum of Instructions, but exclusive of the transfer to(or from) Depreciation Fund or Suspense Account, and of the item &quot; Engine Power suppliedto and by the Company (balance) &quot; in the case of &quot; B &quot; (1), is to be the commencing figurein each formula.Credits for Supervision, &amp;c, War Manufactures, &amp;c, Accounts.5. Any credits for (a) supervision charged to the Government in respect of WarManufactures, &amp;c, and (b) supervision and profit charged to Armament Firms, must beadded to the expenditure.Expenditure on Government Work charged to Revenue Expenditure.6. Any amounts included in the revenue expenditure for work done for the Government-e.g., &quot; Sundry small works for the Government&quot; (vide Instruction No. 294), specialalterations, &amp;c, to rolling stock necessary for the purpose of conveying Naval and MilitaryTraffic, &amp;c. must be deducted therefrom.New Lines opened and Additions to Rolling Stock in Service.7. The amount presumed to be included in the expenditure in respect of repairs andrenewals of additional length of line or additions to Rolling Stock in service, as comparedwith the year 1913 (and, therefore, to be deducted from such expenditure in comparingit with the expenditure of the year 1913 for the purpose of determining the arrears ofmaintenance in terms of money), is to be arrived at as follows: (a) Renewals.-The amount to which the Company is entitled under theprovisions of the agreed interpretation of Clause 4 of the Memorandum of Instructions.  (vide Circular Letter No. 686) must be adopted, increased by a percentage to bringit up to the rates of wages and prices of materials of the control period under review.(b) Repairs.-In the case of &quot; Programme &quot; Companies, who provide on a fixedbasis, for repairs as well as renewals, the amount must be calculated in accordancewith the usual practice of the Companies, increased by a percentage to bring it upto the rates of wages and prices of materials of the control period under review. Inthe case of Companies who do not provide for repairs on a fixed basis, the amountis to be basecj upon the unit cost of repairs for the year 1913.  The unit cost of repairs,\
to be arrived at by dividing the expenditure shown under the undermentioned headingsin the published accounts for the year 1913 by the number of the relative units asgiven in the Statistical Returns for that year, and such unit costs are to be multipliedby the number of additional units in each case, the resulting figure to be increasedby a percentage to bring it up to the rates of wages and prices of materials of thecontrol period under review.Abstract &quot;A.&quot;Repairs of Running Lines and Sidings. 1 TT ..   w     .  ,      .,     ,  m   ,Maintenance of Signalling.

Unit-Per Coaching Vehicle.(3) Wagons.Repairs and Partial Renewals. Unit Per Merchandise and MineralVehicle.In the case of a &quot;Programme&quot; Company whose programme covers partial aswell as complete renewals, the unit cost of repairs must be ascertained after eliminatingfrom the expenditure for the year 1913 the amounts expended on partial renewals.Reduction in Mileage of Line open for Traffic.8. In the event of the number of miles of line open for traffic having been reducedin consequence of the taking up of lines for the purpose of sending Permanent Way materialsto France, or otherwise, due allowance should be made in each control period for suchreduction both in respect of repairs and renewals, unless it can be shown that the circum-stances justify the omission of such an allowance.Reduction in Numbers of Rolling Stock in Service.9. In the event of the number of Locomotives, Carriages or Wagons respectively, inservice at the 31st December of the year of control under review being less than the numberin service at the 31st December, 1913, the expenditure during the control year must beincreased by an amount arrived at as follows, unless it can be shown that the capacityor first cost of the Locomotives, Carriages or Wagons respectively in service at the 31stDecember of the control year is not less than the capacity or first cost of the vehiclesexisting at the end of 1913 : (a) Renewals. In the case of &quot; Programme &quot; Companies-Companies whoprovide for renewals (complete or partial) on a fixed basis the amount, if any, mustbe calculated in accordance with the usual practice of the Companies, increased bya percentage to bring it up to the rates of wages and prices of materials of the controlperiod under review. In the case of other Companies, the Company must satisfythe Investigators that the amount dealt with is reasonable having regard to all thecircumstances.(b) Repairs. In the case of &quot; Programme &quot; Companies who provide on a fixedbasis for repairs as well as renewals, the amount, if any, must be calculated inaccordance with the usual practice of the Companies, increased by a percentage tobring it up to the rates of wages and prices of materials of the control period underreview. In the case of Companies who do not provide for repairs on a fixed basis,the amount is to be based upon the unit cost of repairs for the year 1913, arrived atas set out in section (6) of Clause 7 hereof.Statistical Returns la and II of the Published Accounts and Returns.10. WTith reference to the foregoing Clauses Nos. 7, 8 and 9 : in view of the fact thatStatistical Returns Ia and II have not been published since 1915 it will be necessary tosubmit to the Investigators, and append to the claims, such returns, duly certified bythe responsible officer concerned. So far as Statistical Return Ia is concerned, anyreduction in the mileage due to the taking up of Permanent Way materials for France orotherwise should be indicated. So far as Statistical Return No. II-Rolling Stock, isconcerned, no alteration should be made in the numbers in respect of Rolling Stock onloan to the Government for use overseas, i.e., Rolling Stock for whicl^ the Government&apos;have made no payment,(B16959) I
Rolling Stock built or repaired otherwise than in the Companies&apos; Workshops.11. In the case of Rolling Stock purchased in the control period in replacement ofother vehicles, or in the case of Rolling Stock repaired by outside firms, which under ordinarycircumstances would have been built or repaired in the Companies&apos; Workshops, theadditional cost arising from that circumstance will not be represented by the percentagearrived at as indicated in these Instructions, and should be the subject of a separatededuction from the expenditure of the control period under review as compared with theexpenditure of the year 1913. In arriving at this deduction, the amount paid in respectof such work must be put in relation to the cost which would have been incurred in doingthe work in the Companies&apos; Workshops in the control period under review, including a dueallowance for workshop expenses.It must be noted that the amount included in Abstract &quot;B &quot; (1), (2) and (3) underthe headings of &quot; Wages &quot; and/or &quot; Materials &quot; on account of work executed by outsidefirms, in respect of which a special deduction is made under this clause, should be excludedfrom the headings referred to for the purpose of ascertaining the percentage increase underClauses 17, 19 and 20 hereof.Additional Renewal or Depreciation Provisions other than in respect of New Lines and/orRolling Stock.12. The amount allowed to a Company through Abstracts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; (1), (2)and (3) in the Government Account, by way of a renewal or depreciation provision, in excessof, or additional to, the provision for the year 1913, in respect of works or equipmentother than Permanent Way and/or Rolling Stock, should be dealt with as a deductionon the same lines as those adopted in the case of &quot; New Lines opened &quot; and &quot; Additionsto Rolling Stock in Service &quot; (vide Clause 7 hereof).Special Expenditure incurred in the lifting and restoration of Permanent Way due toShortage of Materials.13. In cases where a Company, owing to the shortage of materials, has lifted rails,&amp;c, from a line which would not otherwise have been disturbed, for use on a more importantsection of line, the cost incurred in such lifting operations may be deducted from theexpenditure in arriving at the claim for Arrears of Maintenance, together with the labourcost incurred in the restoration of the former line. In the event of the restoration nothaving been effected prior to the end of the period of control, the estimated cost of thelabour to be expended in connection with such restoration should be claimed speciallyfrom the Government.Additional Expenditure for Abnormal Wear and Tear.14, Any amount included in the expenditure, representing additional costs incurred,as the result of abnormal wear and tear to which the Permanent Way or Rolling Stockof a Company has been subjected during the control period, should be deducted fromsuch expenditure. Owing to the varying circumstances of the Companies, it is impossibleto stereotype a method for arriving at the deductions referred to in this paragraph. EachCompany, therefore, who makes such a deduction will be required to produce sufficientevidence, accompanied by a report from the Chief Executive Officer concerned, to satisfythe Government Auditor that the abnormal wear and tear so deducted has taken placeand that the expenditure has been incurred during the control period in making the samegood.Allowance for Increased Rates of Wages and Prices of Materials.15. The deduction from the expenditure in the control period, in order to makeallowance for the difference between rates of wages and between prices of materials inthe two periods, is to be arrived at as provided in the following Clauses, Nos. 16 to 20inclusive.Increased Rates of Wages. Abstract &quot;A.&quot;16. (a) Each Company to select in the control period under review the prescribednumber of weeks. These weeks should, so far as possible, correspond with those selectedin the case of the year 1913, and in the event of there being any variation, the Investigatorswill require to be satisfied as to the circumstances under which such variation has beenmade. The periods represented by the selected weeks must be fixed so as to comprisewithin each such period any variation which may have arisen in the rates of pay per hour,piece-work allowances, overtime allowances, or War Bonus payments.
(6) Each Company to ascertain the total actual days or hours worked by employeeswhose wages are mainly chargeable to Abstract &quot; A,&quot; in each of the selected weeks, whetherat ordinary, piece-work or overtime rates, together with the total amount of earnings paidto the eriiployees in respect of such days or hours.(c) The total earnings for each selected week to be divided by the total days or hoursactually worked for the same week. This will give for each of the selected weeks the averagedaily or hourly wages cost. The average rates per day or hour to be calculated to not lessthan three places of decimals.(It should be noted that as a result of the issue of Circular Letter No. 984, whichprovided for Conciliation War Bonus following the wages as from 1st January, 1917,the amount of the Conciliation War Bonus should be included with the total earnings.)(d) The average daily or hourly wages cost for each of the selected weeks to bemultiplied by the number of weeks within the period represented by that week as definedin section (a) of this Clause, and the total of the resulting figures when divided by 52 willgive the average daily or hourly wages cost for the control period under review, whichmust be placed in relation to the average daily or hourly wages cost in the year 1913ascertained for the purpose of previous Arrears Statements. The increase shown to beexpressed in the terms of a percentage of the former average.The percentage increase so ascertained to be applied to the total amount of the wagespaid in the control period under review in connection with Abstract &quot; A,&quot; and the figuresso modified will be &quot; the wages cost of work carried out in the control period under reviewat the rates of wages for the year 1913 &quot; referred to in Clause 20 hereof.Increased Rates of Wages. Abstract &quot; B &quot; (I), (2) and (3).17. (a) Each Company to select in the control period under review the prescribednumber of weeks. These weeks should, as far as possible, correspond with those selectedin the case of the year 1913, and in the event of there being any variation, the Investigatorswill require to be satisfied as to the circumstances under which such variation has beenmade. The periods represented by the selected weeks must be fixed so as to comprisewithin each such period any variation which may have arisen in the rates of pay per hour,piece-work allowances, overtime allowances, or War Bonus payments.(b) Each Company to ascertain the total actual hours worked by employees whosewages are mainly chargeable to Abstract &quot;B &quot; (1), (2) and (3), in each of selected weeks,whether at ordinary, piece-work or overtime rates, together with the total amount ofearnings paid to the employees in respect of such hours. Each section of Abstract &quot; B &quot;to be dealt with separately as provided herein.(c) The total earnings for each selected week to be divided by the total hours actuallyworked for the same week. This will give for each of the selected weeks the averagehourly wages cost. The average rates per hour to be calculated to not less than threeplaces of decimals.(It should be noted that as a result of the issue of Circular Letter No. 984, whichprovided for Conciliation War Bonus following the wages as from 1st January, 1917,the amount of the Conciliation War Bonus should be included with the total earnings.)(d) The average hourly wages cost for each of the selected weeks to be multiplied bythe number of weeks within the period represented by that week as defined in section(a) of this Clause, and the total of the resulting figures when divided by 52 will give theaverage hourly wages cost for the control period under review, which must be placed inrelation to the average hourly wages cost in 1913, ascertained for the purpose of previousArrears Statements. The increase shown to be expressed in the terms of a percentageof the former average.The percentage increase so ascertained to be applied to the &quot; Wages &quot; items shownunder the headings &quot; Complete Renewals &quot; and &quot; Repairs and Partial Renewals &quot; inAbstract &quot; B &quot; (1), (2) and (3) respectively, for the control period under review, and the  -figures so modified will be &quot; the wages cost of work carried out in the control period underreview at the rates of wages for the year 1913 &quot; referred to in Clause 20 hereof.Increased Prices of Materials. Abstract &quot;A.&quot;18. (a) In order to avoid the trouble of calculating the whole of the materials usedin the control period at prices for the year 1913, not less than 80 per cent, (in value).shallbe so calculated.(6) In determining the minimum of 80 per cent, (in value) the gross debit for thematerials issued and used at the actual issue prices i.e., before taking credit for the amount
dealt with in respect of scrap materials returned should be adopted as the basis for thetotal value of the materials mainly charged to Abstract &quot; A.&quot; So far as possible thematerials selected should correspond with the materials selected in the case of previousArrears Statements.(c) The actual quantities of the materials issued and used mainly chargeable toAbstract &quot; A,&quot; selected to represent the 80 per cent, in the control period under review,and the cost thereof at actual issue prices, to be tabulated in detail and compared in thetotal with the cost for similar quantities at the issue prices for the year 1913, the netincrease so ascertained to be expressed as a percentage of the former cost.The percentage increase so ascertained to be applied to the cost of all materials usedin the control period under review and charged to Abstract &quot;A,&quot; after taking credit forthe amount dealt with in respect of scrap materials returned, which will give &quot; the cost atthe prices for the year 1913 of materials used in Maintenance and Renewal Work carriedout in the control period under review,&quot; referred to in Clause 20 hereof.(In ascertaining the amounts included in Abstract &quot; A &quot; for &quot; Wages &quot; and&quot; Materials &quot; respectively, amounts paid to Contractors for work done to be excludedfrom the respective items, unless it has been the practice of the Company to make anactual allocation of such amounts to the two headings.)Increased Prices of Materials.

It must be noted that all Companies are required to compile a statement in theform provided, and that no Company will be entitled to retain or receive any amount inrespect of Arrears of Maintenance unless there are Arrears of Work for the whole periodof control. Those Companies, therefore, making a claim in respect of either Abstractfor the control period under review must reduce the amount so claimed by the net excess,if any, produced by the statements rendered in respect of that Abstract for the controlperiod to the previous 31st December. Similarly, those Companies who show an excessof work in either Abstract for the control period under review will be required to refundthe amount of such excess, with the proviso that the amount so refunded shall not exceedthe amount received by the Company in respect of that Abstract for Arrears of Main-tenance to the previous 31st December.Abnormal Wear and Tear.26. It should be noted that the claims to be made under these Instructions do nottake into account the abnormal wear and tear to which the Permanent Way and RollingStock of certain Companies may have been subjected during the control period, so far assuch abnormal wear and tear has not been made good during that period, and that anyCompany who is in a position to substantiate a claim under this head should make itsclaim independently of the claims submitted for Arrears of Work.

They also suggest that the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Ministry ofMunitions should also be furnished by your Department with copies of the relevant docu-ments.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) T. L. HEATH.The Secretary,Board of Trade.(The draft letter contained the Supplementary Clauses to the Agreement. These clauses as finallyapproved are printed in Document No. 71.) 1
(73)R. 3655.F.   184.Board of Trade.23rd August, 1916.My dear Sir Herbert Walker,With reference to Mr. Marwood&apos;s letter to yourself of the 12th October, 1914,* and sub-sequent correspondence on the subject of the Agreement as to the compensation to be paidby His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Railway Companies under the Regulation of the ForcesAct, 1871, and to the recent discussions between representatives of the Treasury and of theRailway Executive Committee, I am now in a position to state that the Treasury havesignified their readiness to accept the Clauses, of which copies are enclosed, as interpreting andamplifying that Agreement, on the understanding that the Clauses are accepted in theirentirety by all the Companies concerned.As the matter is one which will have to be dealt with by the individual Boards ofDirectors, the Board of Trade will be obliged if the Railway Executive Committee willtake steps to ascertain whether the controlled Railway Companies are prepared to acceptthe Clauses.Yours faithfully,(Signed) WALTER RUNCIMAN.The Acting Chairman,Railway Executive Committee.* Document No. 11.(74)F. 184.W.Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.21th October, 1916.Sir,I am pleased to be able to inform you that we have received assent to the proposalscontained in your letter of the 23rd August from all the Companies. Some of the Companies,however, have raised a question with regard to arrears of maintenance ; one Company inparticular, whose interest in docks is very large in proportion to the size of its Railwayundertaking, is pressing strongly that their -position should be clearly defined before thenew proposals are accepted. In the Railway Accounts, Docks are not included in the sameAbstract as the permanent way and the works relating to it, and, under the arrangementscome to with the Government, it is only the arrears on permanent way (Abstract A) andengines, carriages and wagons (Abstract B) that are included in the monthly estimatesand paid for by the Government currently.So far as I am aware, there is no difference in principle between one Abstract andanother, but it is not so easy to devise a working formula for the other Abstracts, andAbstracts A and B cover by far the greater part of the works of maintenance.We have told the - Companies that arrears of maintenance in the case of works notincluded in those Abstracts will, under the existing arrangement with the Government, bedealt with at the conclusion of the war, as in the case of Steamships, which you will remem-ber were specially mentioned in connection with the recent negotiations. I do not thinkthere is any doubt as to the position, because the general principle of making good to theCompanies their arrears of maintenance has been recognised by the Government fromthe first; but, as the point has definitely been taken in connection with the present settle-ment, the Executive Committee would be glad to have a definite confirmation by theTreasury of their understanding of the position.Of course, there will be nothing to prevent the Companies submitting to the Treasurya scheme for including further items of maintenance arrears in the monthly statements that is, extending to other Abstracts the procedure already adopted in the case of AbstractsA and B so as to avoid an undue accumulation of detail at the end of the Government
control; but the Executive Committee are not in a position to do this at the present moment,and any such proposal would, I presume, have to be dealt with on its merits when made.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) H.

I am afraid the letter fromthe Treasury, dated 9th December, does not go quite far enough. It is noted that SirThomas Heath states that My Lords of the Treasury will be prepared if necessary to con-sider the extension to other Abstracts of the procedure already adopted in the case ofAbstracts A and B, provided that the arrears involved are of substantial amount andthat satisfactory working formulas can be devised.If you will read the last paragraph of my letter of the 27th October you will noticethat it is therein stated that the Executive Committee are not in a position at presentto put forward such a proposal. What certain Railway Companies, however, do askis that the Treasury shall agree that the Railway Companies will have a claim againstthe Government at the end of the period of the war or at the end of the period of controlin regard to arrears of maintenance in the case of works not included in any arrangementnow made or to be made for the payment of deferred maintenance.Will you be good enough to put this point definitely to the Treasury and get anunderstanding from them.

The complete statements will be investigated subsequently by Investigators from theCompany appointed to examine your account of the net receipts.2. With regard to Clauses 16 and 17 of the Instructions, the prescribed number, ofweeks for the year 1919 is five for Abstract &quot; A &quot; and four for Abstracts &quot; B &quot; (1), (2)and (3).3. In* view of the concessions made to men in the conciliation grades in connectionwith holidays with pay, it will be necessary when such are not reflected in the average dailyor hourly wage, to deal with the amount actually incurred during 1919 and included inAbstracts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B,&quot; in respect of holidays with pay in excess of holidays (if any)granted with pay in the year 1913, as a special deduction in the formulae, in the same wayas &quot; Expenditure on Work for the Government charged to Revenue.&quot;4. In ascertaining the increased cost of the wages paid in 1919 as compared with1913, under Clauses 16 and 17 of the Instructions, the bonus payments to the supervisorystaff -under Circular Letter No. 1901 are to be excluded from the 1919 wages figures, anddealt with as a special deduction in the formulae.5. Any expenditure incurred during 1919 in respect of the repair of rolling stockloaned to your Company by His Majesty&apos;s Government should form a deduction fromAbstract &quot; B &quot; for arrears of maintenance purposes.* This is the letter issued to the Eailway Companies enclosing the Brown Book.(B 16959) G 3

(87)F. 195.P. 2224/8 Wr.Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.1th May, 1919.Dear Sir Auckland Geddes,1. With reference to my conversation with you this afternoon in regard to the capitalnecessary for carrying out Railway schemes of new construction ;2. As I explained to you, most of the large Railway Companies have schemes in handwhich necessitate the spending of large sums of money on capital account, but they donot feel in a position to authorise this expenditure until they know exactly what theirposition is likely to be in regard to the future of their undertakings.3. These new schemes may be roughly classified under three headings :-(a) New sidings and railways or alterations asked for by firms and others in orderto enable them to increase their premises and output.(b) Schemes of alteration necessary to enable economies in working to be effectedby the Railway Companies.(c) Alterations, widenings, rebuilding of stations, provision of Rolling Stock, &amp;c,necessary to enable the Railway Companies to adequately deal with the normalincrease in traffic.4. At the present time the most urgent cases are those referred to under category (1)above, and I would call your attention to the three following : Note.-Here followed details of certain proposed new works.5. These are typical cases of Works which appear to be urgently required, but theRailway Companies cannot be expected to find the necessary capital under existing oon-ditions.  Their objections are on financial grounds, and include (a) The inadequate amount allowed for interest on capital works brought into use i.e., 4 per cent.(b) The fact that no interest is allowed until the Works are brought into use.(c) The heavy increased cost for carrying on the work at existing rates of wages andprices of material.(d) The uncertainty as to how the Railway Companies will be recouped for such.  expenditure in the case of the Government deciding to take over the Railways.6. We took the matter up with the Minister Designate of Ways and Communications,and have received a letter from Sir Francis Dunnell to the effect that Sir Eric Geddesfeels that until the new Ministry is formed he is not in a position to take action, and suggeststhat we deal with it through the Board of Trade.7. I enclose you a copy of a letter we addressed to the President of the Board of Trade(Board of Trade ref. R. 1563) on the 10th April, 1918,* which resulted in an agreementbeing arrived at for the financing of new works carried out as a War measure at the requestof the Board of Trade or of the Railway Executive Committee.8. We would suggest that if possible a new arrangement be come to with the Treasuryunder which any new works which it is necessary to put in hand shall be financed on thebasis laid down in Clause 7, Sub-sections (b), (c), (d), and (e) and Clause 8 of our letterof the 10th April, 1918, above referred to.9. We are preparing for Sir Eric Geddes a list of new works which the Railway Com-panies consider should be proceeded with forthwith. The cost of these works runs intoseveral millions, and it will be necessary, of course, to come to some decision as to thepriority under which the works shall be put in hand.  This, however, we can arrange.Yours faithfully,(Signed)  H. A. WALKER,Acting Chairman.Sir Auckland Geddes,Board of Trade.* See Document No. 94.

At the present time,however, the Railway Companies are deterred from undertaking such schemes by reason ofthe existing financial arrangements. The principal considerations put forward on behalfof the Companies in this respect are-(a) The inadequate amount allowed for interest on capital works brought into use i.e., 4 per cent.(b) The fact that no interest is allowed until the works are brought into use.(c) The heavy increased cost of carrying out the work at existing rates of wages andprices of material.(d) The uncertainty as to how the Railway Companies will be recouped for suchexpenditure in the case of the Government deciding to take over the Railways.The matter is also referred to in letters, copies of which are enclosed,f which have beenreceived from the Irish Railway Executive Committee in the matter.It is suggested on behalf of the Companies that fresh approved capital expenditurein such circumstances should be provided by the Government on the lines which have beenlaid down in the case of works constructed by the Companies for the Government.The Board, however, consider that the case might be substantially met if the intereston capital expenditure when provided by the Companies, on new works, or additional rollingstock, brought into use were increased to, say, 5^ or 6 per cent., and an undertaking weregiven to the Companies that in the event of their undertakings being acquired by theGovernment the consideration to be given in respect of such capital expenditure should bethe actual cost which has been incurred, together with an addition for interest on the sumexpended up to the time when the works were brought into use.The Board would be glad to learn that the Lords Commissioners can see their way toagree to arrangements being made on this basis.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) W.

Illfor the expenditure on new works and rolling stock by advances from Government Funds.They recognise that the interest obtained on present investments may in many cases be inexcess of 4, per cent., and They are accordingly prepared to concur in the rate of interestallowed on capital expenditure on new works or additional rolling stock after the 1stinstant being raised to 5 per cent., such interest to begin to accrue as from the date whenthe capital expenditure is incurred.With regard to the undertaking which it is proposed to give to the Companies as to theallowance to be made in respect of such capital expenditure in the event of the Governmentdeciding to purchase the railways, it is not clear to Their Lordships in what way preciselythe Railway Companies will be affected by a transfer of their assets from investments torolling stock or new works. They are, however, prepared to concur in an assurance beinggiven that in the contingency contemplated the price to be paid for the undertakings shallnot be affected one way or the other by the arrangements now agreed to.******I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) T.

out of new works involving capital expenditure. You are aware that the present arrange-ment with the Government is, broadly, that on expenditure on works brought into usesince the end of the year 1912 the Government pay interest at the rate of 4 per cent, perannum as from the date the work was brought into use. The Government have now agreedthat as regards future capital expenditure Le., sums expended upon works or rollingstock since 1st May last, and chargeable to capital interest at the rate of 5 per cent, perannum shall be allowed as from the date the expenditure is incurred, provided the expendi-ture itself is approved by the Government.2. The Executive Committee are in communication with the Government as to theprocedure under which the necessary approval of the Government is to be obtained, tillsuch procedure has been agreed, particulars of capital expenditure proposed by any Com-pany can be forwarded to this Committee, who will endeavour to obtain the necessaryapproval.3. The new rate of interest will be applicable to further capital expenditure on worksat present in hand and on works commenced before the war and discontinued and nowproceeded with, provided in each case the Government approval is obtained. It maytherefore happen that in some cases interest will be payable by the Government at twodifferent rates and on two different bases in respect of one work that is to say, interestmay accrue in respect of part of the expenditure at the rate of 4 per cent, from the date thework is brought into use, and in respect of the other part at the rate of 5 per cent, from thedate when the money is expended. &apos; &quot;4. The Executive Committee are in negotiation with the Government as to the allow-ance to be made to the Companies in respect of new capital expenditure in the event of theGovernment deciding hereafter to take over the Railways. As to this you will be advisedlater on, but it is understood that the Government are prepared to give an assurance thatin that event the Companies are neither to be financially prejudiced nor financially advan-taged by reason of having incurred capital expenditure under the arrangement outlinedin this Circular.Yours faithfully,(Signed) H.

(94)P. 1981. Railway Executive Committee,P.R. 2484, 35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.10th April, 1918.Dear Sir,Payment for Works carried out by Railway Companies at the request of theBoard of Trade.1. At the interview you were good enough to accord us on the 28th ultimo we dis-cussed, amongst other things, the question of the method of payment for new works carriedout by the Railway Companies at the request of the Board of Trade.2. Ever since the commencement of the war the Railway Companies have been con-structing works for the various Government Departments under an arrangement bywhich the orders for all such works are, as a general practice, co-ordinated through the WarOffice. This was done because it was found at an earlier stage of the war that therequirements of the various departments--i.e., War Office, Admiralty, Ministry ofMunitions, and others, had a tendency to overlap.3. The arrangement of co-ordination through the War Office has worked very well,and includes, amongst other things, an Agreement under which the Government will payfor all such new works on the understanding that at the termination of the war, or as soonthereafter as possible, the Companies should decide whether or not they were prepared totake over, on agreed terms, such works, or the materials forming works not required to beretained, or any part of them. In the case of those works and materials which the RailwayCompanies decide not to take over, any material recovered to remain the property of theGovernment, who would bear the cost of recovery and making good.4. Under these arrangements the Government pay 50 per cent, of the estimated costat the time the work is ordered and the balance as soon as the actual cost of the workhas been ascertained.5. It would appear that the time has now arrived when the Railway Companies willhave to carry out a considerable amount of work on behalf of departments under thecontrol of the Board of Trade, particularly the Coal Controller and Timber Controller, andit is necessary that the procedure and method of payment should be agreed.6. We think that arrangements similar to those recorded in Paragraphs 3 and 4 of thisletter will meet the case. We are of opinion, however, that it is not necessary for these newworks to be co-ordinated through the War Office, and that the arrangements should be leftentirely in the hands of the Board of Trade, with the Railway Companies immediatelyconcerned and the Railway Executive Committee.7. We suggest, therefore, that the following procedure and method of payment shouldbe adopted :-(a) In the case of new sidings asked for by the Coal Controller or the Timber Controller,arrangements for the preparation of the necessary plans and estimates to bemade direct with the Company concerned.(b) In the case of additional accommodation required by a Railway Company forproperly dealing with large increases in traffic, the Railway Company concernedto report to the Railway Executive Committee with the necessary plans andestimates. If the Railway Executive Committee agree that the work is neces-sary, they to forward the plans and estimates to the Board of Trade with flieirrecommendation.(c) If the Board of Trade agree with the, works under (a) or (6) being proceeded with,they to give the necessary instructions to the Railway Executive Committee,who will advise the Company or Companies concerned.(d) The Board of Trade to arrange, when the order is given for the work, for an amountequal to 50 per cent, of the estimated cost of the work to be credited to theRailway Executive Committee for payment to the Company or Companiescarrying out the work.(e) On completion of the work the Company or Companies concerned to send an accountto the Railway Executive Committee for submission to the Board of Trade&quot; whowill arrange for the amount due to be credited to the Railway ExecutiveCommittee,
8. If, after the termination of the War, any Railway Company decides for its ownpurposes to take over any works, or any part of any works, carried out during the periodof Government Control under arrangements or by the orders of a Government department,they may do so on terms to be agreed. Any works carried out for Government depart-ments, or by arrangement with the Government, during the period of control, not requiredto be retained, to be removed and the Government credited with the value of the materialsrecovered, less the cost of recovery and making good.In the case of sidings and works that may be required to be retained permanentlyby, or on behalf of, a Government Department, after the control, agreements in regardthereto and the method of working to be entered into between the Government Departmentsand the Railways Companies affected.Yours faithfully,(Signed) H.

The members of this Committee will be glad therefore tohave an assurance from you that the Railway Companies will be compensated at the end ofthe period of control for any depreciation of their property that may have resulted fromthe use of uncreosoted sleepers.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) H.

Uncreosoted Sleepers.Owing to the restrictions that have been placed on the use of creosote, the variousRailway Companies are having to place into their road a considerable number of uncreosotedsleepers and crossing timbers.  The attention of this Committee has been called to the
serious effect this will have upon the life of the road, and as a consequence the heavy addi-tional expense that will be thrown upon the Companies an expense which is only par-tially dealt with under the heading of &quot; Deferred Maintenance.&quot;The question has been carefully considered by a Sub-Committee consistig of SirA. Kaye Butterworth, Mr. F. Potter and Mr. D. Matheson, and I have to suggest that aMeeting should be arranged between these three, gentlemen and someone acting on behalfof the Treasury, in order that the matter may be discussed and a decision come to as tothe best way of meeting the difficulty that has arisen.Yours faithfully,(Signed) H. A. WALKER,Acting Chairman.The Secretary,H.M.

KAYE BUTTERWORTH.E. G. Moggridge, Esq.,Board of Trade, S.W.(Enclosure in Sir Alexander Butterworth&apos;s letter oflQth May, 1918.)Memorandum regarding Restriction in the use oe Creosote.The Railway Executive Committee have been informed by the Government that inconsequence of the restrictions in imports, the tonnage of creosote necessary for properlypreserving the sleepers required for the renewal of the permanent way is not available.If normal working is to be maintained and safety ensured, renewal of the permanent waymust be continued.The result is that the Companies must either (1) Lay uncreosoted sleepers or sleepers treated with substitutes, &apos;or(2) Reduce the speed of trains.The latter alternative is not a practicable one, because normal working must as far aspossible be maintained. On the other hand, safety is imperative. The Companies cannottherefore cease laying new sleepers.It is estimated that the life of an uncreosoted sleeper is only about 7 years as comparedwith an average life of some 18 years in the case of creosoted sleepers. It follows, there-fore, that all clean sleepers put into the permanent way during the period.of Governmentcontrol will have to be renewed long before the normal date, with a corresponding moneyloss to the Companies.Suggestions have been made for getting over, or partially getting over, the shortageof creosote, either by the use of substitute preserving material or of hard wood sleepers not
requiring treatment. But when all alternative methods have been made use of, it is clearthat a large number of uncreosoted sleepers, or at any rate sleepers not by any means up topre-war standard, will have to be laid, and it is to meet this loss that the Railway ExecutiveCommittee have to put forward a claim for compensation, and their suggestion is that themoney loss involved in the laying of other than creosoted sleepers should be ascertained onan actuarial basis, and allowed as a special item in the monthly accounts for Arrears ofMaintenance.In making this suggestion, it is desired to point out that it involves no new principle,but is merely a variation of a principle already admitted and acted upon. The existingformula which has been adopted for ascertaining the amounts due to the Companies forArrears of Maintenance cannot be regarded as invariable, or as representing a hard and fastbargain ; it represents the simplest and most accurate means that so far has been suggestedfor measuring and comparing the work done in any year of the control with the workdone in 1913. For that purpose a money basis has been accepted, but the formula makes noattempt to equalise any difference in circumstances other than variations in cost of materialsand labour.The present problem is how to arrive at an equitable method of making allowance forthe fact that there is a difference in the value of the work done quite apart from the differencein the value of money. Thus,  1,000 spent in 1918 in laying uncreosoted sleepers may re-present, say,  600 only, so far as a comparison of the actual cost of similar work in the twoperiods goes (and that difference is reflected in the existing formula); but the ultimate valueto the Railway Companies of the work actually done compared with the ultimate value ofan expenditure of  1,000 upon crcosoted sleepers may be only  350, and it is for the ascer-tainment of this second difference that a formula is needed.The Executive Committee are advised that there will be no difficulty in ascertainingwith sufficient accuracy the loss involved by the laying of other than creosoted sleepersbut there is one point of detail in connection with the calculation to which it may be well todraw attention viz., that in the case of those Companies that have a claim against theGovernment for Arrears of Maintenance, allowance will have to be made for the fact thatsuch claim will be increased by the amount of immediate saving caused by the laying ofother than creosoted sleepers. This arises from (1) the saving of the cost of the creosoteitself, and (2) the saving of the cost of labour in creosoting the timber. There will, how-ever, be no difficulty in making the necessary adjustment to meet this point.It was suggested at the meeting held at the Board of Trade on the 2nd instant withrepresentatives of the Board of Trade and Treasury, that the principle involved in thepresent claim might extend beyond the present case. This may be so, but the ExecutiveCommittee submit that that is no reason for postponing the settlement of the present claimif it is found to admit of an immediate and simple solution, even though the Governmentmay deem it necessary to safeguard the consideration of future claims of a cognate characterunprejudiced by anything done with reference to the present claim.At the same time it is right to point out that the broad principle underlying the arrange-ments between the Government and the Railway Companies is that the Railways shall bemaintained at the cost of the Government during the period of control, and handed overto the Companies at the end of that period in the same condition physically, so far aspossible, as they were in at the commencement neither better nor worse. In accordancewith this principle it has been laid down that the standard of maintenance to be observedis that which was followed by the Companies in the year 1913, and it is submitted that thepresent claim is merely an application of this principle to a particular case.(105)F. 181.Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co.,3, Frederick^ Place,Old Jewry, London, E.C.llth June, 1918.Dear Mr. Moggridge,State Control of Railways. Supply of Creosote.I have perused your file of papers and return it herewith.I notice from the minutes of the meeting at which you presided and at which represen-tatives of the Railway Executive Committee and of the Treasury were present, that thelatter raised the question as to whether the State should assume responsibility for losses
suffered by the Companies arising out of the general circumstances brought about by thewar.If it be conceded that this responsibility falls upon the Government on the ground thatthey must hand back the undertakings at the termination of control in a condition as goodas that in which they were at the beginning of control, it seems that the Companies will havea claim for compensation if, owing to the necessary employment of uncreosoted sleepers,additional expense is likely to fall upon them in the future in maintaining their property.There would then remain only the question of determining how this compensationshould be computed and when it should be paid.As to the method of computation, I do not suppose there will be much difficulty inframing a formula to meet the case. The Railway Executive Committee might be asked tosuggest such a formula for consideration.It will also be necessary to consider whether the principle whereby payments aremade to the Railway Companies for arrears of maintenance in advance of their under-taking the maintenance work represented by those arrears should apply to such a case asis now under consideration.Yours truly,(Signed) ALBERT W.

They are accordingly prepared to admitin principle the liability of the Exchequer for some compensation to the Railways on thisaccount.They direct me to state, however, that, as at present advised, they see no justi-fication for extending to this special case the principle whereby payments are made forarrears of maintenance in advance of the execution of the maintenance work representedby those arrears.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) T.

With regard to this I have to say that it was not intendedto suggest that that principle should be extended to the case of uncreosoted sleepers.The formula which has been prepared by the Engineers and Accountants is on the basisof compensation being paid which represents the present value of the loss which the:Railways would ultimately- incur-that is to say, the ultimate Toss would be&apos;discountedaccording to the estimated life of the sleepers. This is what was intended to:be conveyedby the expression &quot;on an actuarial basis &quot;in the statement submitted by the Committeeto the Board of Trade. At the same time it was thought, and the Committee still think,that it would be much better to get the formula fixed and worked to forthwith througha system of monthly (discounted) payments on account, &quot;and perhaps you will be goodenough to explain this view of the case to the Treasury.

the Treasury concur in the suggestion, probably the next step should be to arrange ameeting, which Railway Accountants and Engineers should attend to agree upon thedetails of the formula.Yours faithfully,(Signed)  H.

XIV.-INSURANCE OF RAILWAY COMPANIES&apos; PROPERTY AGAINST FIRE.[In February, 1917, the Railway Executive Committee called the attention of the Board of Trade to thefact that certain premises belonging to Railway Companies were being used by Government Departments forpurposes which entailed additional risk of Fire, and asked for an assurance that in the event of Fire arisingin such premises, the Company should be relieved of all liability for damage done either to a shed, or its con-tents, or to adjoining property.

483(115)P. 72/4.E. 180.Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.28$ August, 1919.Sir,Eire Insurance.1. With reference to your letter (R. 1119) of the 4th March as to the acceptance by theGovernment of liability for damage by fire or explosion to Railway Companies&apos; premisesoccupied by the Government, or premises adjacent to those so occupied, subject to certainprovisos which are set out in that letter, I have to inform you that the contents of yourletter were communicated to the controlled Companies with a request to state whetherthey were prepared to accept the terms proposed, and a number of the replies are to theeffect that having regard to the terms of proviso (4), and the insertion of the word &quot; sub-stantially&quot; in proviso (1), the Companies are not prepared to accept the arrangement,which is considered unduly stringent in the form proposed.2. As I think you are aware, the Executive Committee have throughout thought thatthe word &quot; substantially &quot; would give rise to trouble, and this difficulty has been accentu-ated by the attempt to safeguard the situation by a twofold protection-first, by definingthe general character of the occupation (&quot; substantially increasing risk,&quot;), and, secondly,by putting the onus of proof as to the origin of the particular fire, not on the persons inoccupation, but on the owners.3. I shall be glad to know how you propose to meet the situation, as I am convincedthat a number of the Companies will not accept the arrangement in its present form.Yours faithfully,(Signed)&quot; H. A. WALKER,The Assistant Secretary, Acting Chairman.(Railway Department)Board of Trade,7, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.(b 16959) I 4(2) That the Government shall not be liable in so far as the damage is recoverableunder a policy of insurance with an outside insurance company.(3) That the Government has not already entered into an agreement with the RailwayCompany covering the case.(4) That as regards damage from fire the Company shall, so far as the circumstancesof the case will permit, produce satisfactory evidence that the origin of the firewas due to, or that the damage therefrom was substantially increased by,the Government occupation.With regard to the introduction of the word &quot; substantially &quot; in proviso (1), I am tosay that the Treasury take the view, with which the Board of Trade concur, that if theGovernment is to accept liability for the whole damage in any case in which any liabilityis admitted, it is essential that liability should only be admitted in cases in which the riskis substantially increased by reason of the Government occupation.With regard to proviso (4), I am to point out that under the arrangement proposedabove it would not be necessary, as previously suggested, that the premises to which thearrangement applied should be scheduled, and in these circumstances the mere fact of anydamage having occurred from fire to any occupied premises might, but for the proviso,tend to prejudge the question of the existence of special risk.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)  ERNEST G. MOGGRIDGE.The Secretary,Railwav Executive Committee.
(116)R. 1119.F. 180.Board op Trade.5th September, 1919.Sir,In reply to your letter of the 28th August (P. 72/4) on the subject of liability fordamage as a result of fire or explosion to Railway Companies&apos; premises occupied by Govern-ment Departments, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state that, for the reasonsexplained in their letter of the 4th March, they could not agree to the elimination of theword &quot; substantially &quot; in proviso (1) to the arrangements suggested in that letter. It.should not be overlooked that, if any such alteration were made, the effect would be thatpart of the ordinary liability in respect of fire risks on Railway Companies&apos; premises wouldbe transferred from the Railway Companies&apos; insurance funds to the Government withoutany compensating consideration.With regard to the remarks contained in your letter on the subject of proviso (4),I am to say that this proviso was not intended to place the onus of proof as to the originof a particular fire on the Railway Company owning the premises in connection with whichit occurred, but only to require that the Railway Company should, so far as the circum-stances of the case would permit, produce satisfactory evidence in this respect. TheBoard, however, if it is clearly understood that the mere fact of damage having occurredfrom fire to any occupied premises would not be regarded as being in itself evidence ofthe existence of substantially increased risk, would be prepared to suggest to the Treasurythat in all the circumstances it may not be necessary to retain this proviso in additionto proviso (1).I&quot;am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) E.

(123)(Circular Letter, No. 1694.).Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street, Westminster, S.W.23rd January, 1919.Dear Sir,Purchase of Stores for Railway Companies.1. An appeal has been made by the Minister of Munitions and by the President of theBoard of Trade that, with a view to assisting the various firms occupied in manufacturingmaterials and stores used on the Railways, the Railway Companies shall, within the nexttwo or three weeks, place orders for any materials and stores as are manufactured in thiscountry and are likely to be required for use during the next 18 months.2. Many of the larger Railway Companies have expressed themselves as willing tofall in with the proposal, but have asked that some arrangement may be come to with theTreasury in regard to the financing of the arrangement. An Agreement has, therefore,been arrived at with the Treasury and Board of Trade on the following lines : (i) The Companies will agree to place orders at once for all stores required for useduring the present year. The same to be paid for by the Companies as thestores are required by them and charged against the Government as and whenused.(ii) The Companies would further agree to place orders for such stores as they estimatethey will be able to use during the first six months of 1920, on the understandingthat the Companies pay the accounts, and the Government allow interest,at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, on the amounts paid from the date ofpayment to the last day of the month prior to the date on which the storesare issued.(iii) If, as a result of this action, any Company finds itself at the end of the period ofcontrol in possession of a stock of any stores in excess of the stock held by suchCompany at the commencement of the war and such excess quantity has beenpurchased at a price higher than the price current in 1913, the Government shallpay the Company the difference between the purchase price and such currentprice on the excess amount of stores.(iv) In determining whether there is an excess of stores at the end of the controlperiod as compared with 1913, due regard must be had to any material extensionof the Railway system concerned.3. The intention is that any material and stores ordered and used during the Currentyear will be dealt with in the usual way through the Railway Company&apos;s accounts, andthat the arrangement for charging interest will only apply to stores and materials orderedduring the next two months in. anticipation of the requirements for the first six monthsof 1920.If the proposition is one that appeals to you, we shall be glad if you will at once actupon it, advising us in due course of any orders you are able to place for stores and materialsrequired for use during the period January, 1919, to June, 1920.    ,Yours faithfully,(Signed) H.

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE GIVEN BY SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL.Witness pointed out tbat, whereas the intention of the legislature in the Regulation of the Forces Act of 1871was to provide compensation to the Railways for loss or injury sustained by the exercise of the powers for thepurpose of meeting a national emergency such as War, that intention has in fact, by the general trend of thesearrangements, been converted into as complete a guarantee as the ingenuity of the Companies&apos; representatives couldcreate against the Governments action and all other collateral effects of the War.The principle involved by this change does not appear to have been clearly visualised, or fully debated at anystage, and as the arrangements were made piecemeal, they never seem to have been fitted by those responsible into aportrayal of this conversion.There are instances throughout where arrangements or a lino of thought originating obviously from theconception of a short War or a weekly possession of the Railways-have been prolonged throughout the seven years,and have created conditions which cannot have been intended by those who made the arrangements. But as in theinstances quoted below-as regards interest on capital, and diversion of assets from above the line earning to belowthe line earning-there should be complete reciprocity throughout.Apart from these general points, the more important features of the Agreements may be summarised asfollows: 1. Maintenance.RepairsRenewals2. Calculation     oftenance.Main-3. Accumulated MaintenanceFunds.Companies claim they areentitled to spend what isnecessary with no limit.This applies to all abstracts.Coinpuurs admit that forcomplete renewal of runninglines and rolling stock theyarc liable for 1913 cost ofany excess work over 1913quantum, but that tho Go-vernment arc liable foradditional cost over 1913prices. With regard toother renewals the coni-panies claim to have sameliability as in the case ofrepairs except in a few caseswhere there has been adefinite programme.They further claim that eachabstract stands by itself.Companies claim under Cir-cular 686 they are entitledin calculating provision forrenewals to take into ac-eount increased first cost ofrolling stock, even when dueto renewal during control atGovernment expense.No allowance in respect ofrepairs was made by com-panies owning rolling stocksent to France for yearsearlier than 1919, in respectof which year tho formulawas amended.Monthly payments on ac-count of arrears of main-tcnance were agreed. Owingto the length of the periodof control and the smallervolume of work performedthese funds at 115 per cent,of 1913 prices now amountto about  40,000,000.Witness submits maintenance must betreated as a whole and that there should bostrict adherence to the 1913 quantum.This in \vitness&apos;s opinion would be in con-forinity with the spirit and intention ofthe agreements and is essential for theprotection of the Government. Thequantum adjusted of course to currentprices after allowance for units main-tained. If, owing to special circumstances,repairs in excess of 1913 quantum arenecessary, they should form the subjectof a special claim for abnormal wear andtear which would have to be speciallyadjudicated upon.Witness further submits that where sumshave been paid on account of arrears ofmaintenance there should be a definiteterm fixed at the end of which it can beassumed that a line is in a pre-controlstate of repair and any unspent funds inrespect of repairs should revert to theGovernment.Witness can find, no agreement that theGovernment would pay the balance onarrears of maintenance until the work is&apos; actually carried out.As the provision is at 1913 prices subsequentlyadjusted to current prices, witness submitsthat it is inequitable and incorrect to haveregard to increased first cost due solely toreplacement in kind hy the Government.Further that as future renewals will pre-sumably be carried out in the companiesown works the additional cost of buildingin outside contractors&apos; works owing totemporary disturbance should not be takerinto account.Witness submits that in view of the factthat the companies were relieved of theserepairs and also that the cost of recon-ditioning is separately paid for by theWar Office the arrears of maintenanceformula should have made the necessaryallowances.A similar question arises with regard topermanent way which was sold and notlent.Witness considers that tho interest shouldhave been credited to these funds thusreducing the Governments ultimateliability. Further that the portion repre-senting repairs should now be spentbefore any further charges are made inGovernment account. The companies&apos; con-tention at tho time the arrangement wasmade was that these funds were necessaryto &quot; compensate&quot; them for increasedfloating capital is not accepted by the.witness, as statements submitted show the&quot;growth of outside investments for 14 com
3. Accumulated MaintenanceFunds-continued.4. Abnormal Wear and Tear.5. Interest on Capital.6. Revenue Rebates.7. Alteration in use to whichproperty taken over hasbeen put.8. Bad Debts.9. Replacement of Stores.Companies are claiming asabnormal wear and tearitems merely arising in con-trol &quot;put not due to control.Companies receive interest onnew capital works or plantbut no credit is given in res-pect of capital worksdisplaced but not replacedor plant realised, e.g., linestaken up.  Steamers sold.It has been claimed that thecompanies are at liberty tomake at Government ex-penso special rebates toobtain competition advan-tages.Certain premises used in con-nection with earning 1913above the line revenue havebeen devoted to other pur-poses and tho income cre-dited in accordance with tbecompanies&apos; practice of deal-ing with such income belowthe line.Some companies in 1913charged bad debts to&quot; below the line &quot; fund anddid not reduce traffic re-ceipts. Under Section 3 (d)of the Blue Book these com-panies now charge bad debtsto the Government.The existing agreement (Pink-Book p. 89) provides thatthe Government shall payto the companies the differ-ence between book prices in1914 and book prices at endof control on stock of storesat latter date not exceedingstock of stores on hand atcommencement of controlperiod. Further in case ofa shortage, the Governmentto pay the difference be-tween book value in 1914and replacement prices onthe deficiency.panies only from  5,000,000 to  48,000,000since 1913, and in any case no obligationrested with the Government to provide thecompanies with capital to finance thisbusiness. &quot; Control &quot; had nothing to dowith this need.Witness submits that only claims duo tocontrol should be considered. All claimsfor abnormal wear and tear should bespecially submitted and specifically cerfi-fied by an Executive officer and be thesubject of close examination.Witness submits that the arrangementshould be reciprocal. This principle shouldapply to realisation of capital assets notcredited to capital but placed in suspense,e.fif., the large sums received from theGovernment for lost ships and in mostcases not credited to capital.Witness contends that such rebates or anyreductions from book rates should not bogiven during control but if given it canonly be with a view to post control positionand should therefore not be charged to theGovernment.Witness submits that property takenpossession of in 1914 remains in possessionof the Government until the end of con-trol and all revenue accruing duo to altera-tion of user should belong to the Govorn-inent. Interest on the value of property&quot; earning below the lino &quot; revenue in 1913but subsequently taken for &quot; above theline &quot; purposes has been allowed althoughthe capital expenditure was not of recentdate. No objection is taken to this but itshould be reciprocal.Witness submits that as in the case ofcertain companies the receipts in the baseyear were not reduced by any provisionfor bad debts those companies should con-tinue their 1913 practice throughout con-trol. Apart from the relevancy and equityof safeguarding the companies against thecollateral effects of the War.Witness submits that the stock of stores isan essential part of each undertaking ofwhich possession was taken. The com-panies have been paid a proper issue pricefor all stores consumed and as rates havesince been fixed having regard inter aliato current cost of stores witness is ofopinion that on that ground alone theGovernment should not be called upon tobear a burden which has now been placedon the users of the railways. If they are,the companies, at the end of control, willhold a pre-War stock of stores standingat pre-War prices in their books withcharges based on current prices, a circum-stance quite unforseen when the PinkBook was issued.The following instances where the points of view of the Companies are divergent, but which nevertheless areimportant, are given :-The Accountants&apos; Sub-Comittee and Goveru-ment Accountants dissent from this methodof calculation and witness is in agreementwith the Committee. All companies shouldbe required to calculate increased cost onnet and not gross costs.Witness submits that all debits betweenabstracts should be made at current prices.Calculation    of    Main-     (1) Some companies calculatetenance ......       increased cost of renewalsdue to rise in prices ongross cost and not on netcost, i.e., after allowing forscrap value on sales.(2) Some companies in charg-ing for engine power usedfor permanent way mairi-tenance have continued toapply  pre - control  rates,which rates are, under tho &apos;formula reduced by a per-centage intended to repre-.sent increased cost.   Thisunduly     increased     thearrears of maintenance.Witness pointed out to the Committee that the mere settling of ihe account which in some cases have not beencompletely checked since 1915 is bound to be a lengthy and costly process for the Government and one probablyinvolving protracted proceedings before the Railway and Canal Commission although this Court would be primarilyconcerned in the construction and interpretation of the documents rather than the consideration of the exceptionalWar conditions under which the arrangements were made.32046A 2
Submitted by Sin George Beiiarrell.Letter to Mr. Gurney Fowler Regarding the Appointment of Government Accountant.(Vide Questions 405, 2098 and 2118 in Minutes of Evidence.)Board of Trade,S.W.I.7tb December, 1914.R. 13232.Sut,I am directed by the Board of Trade to advertto the arrangement which, as announced in the Press,has been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government with theRailway Executive Committee for the payment ofcompensation during the period for which Railwaysin Great Britain have been taken over by the State.That arrangement is, briefly, that the aggregatenet receipts during the period of tho Railways con-corned are to bo compared with a similar aggregatefor the corresponding period of the previous yearand that tho ascertained deficiency is to be the amountof compensation due, subject however to the followingproviso, viz.: that, if the aggregate net receiptsfor the first half of the year 1914 aro less than theaggregate net receipts for the first half of the year1913, the ascertained deficiency is to be reduced ina like proportion./The question, therefore, arises as to the scope ofthe examination to which the accounts of the Com-panies should be subjected on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment before payment is made.The accounts of all Railway Companies are believedto be at present subject to a complete and detailedaudit which is entirely independent of the manage-ment of the Companies and arrangements will bemade under which the statements on which theExchequer payments aro to bo claimed will be ex-amined and certified by these independent auditors.&quot;Having regard to the position and standing ofthe Companies and to this check, tho Board are ofopinion that payment can properly be made upon suchcertificates subject to a general scrutiny on behalfof His Majesty&apos;s Government of the character referredto,&apos; below.The procedure which is contemplated is that inthe first place the Companies themselves shouldprepare drafts of certain Instructions and Schedulesfor the preparation of the Accounts on lines alreadyindicated to them. When completed these draftswill be submitted to the Government in order thatthey may be criticised and (if necessary) modified bythe Board of Trade who will at this stage consultthe expert selected to scrutinise the accounts, andby the Treasury. The Instructions, &amp;c., will then befinally settled and issued through tho Companies totheir Accountants who will prepare the Accountson the lines thus laid clown. When this has beendone, the Accounts will, in due course, be audited bythe.professional Auditors of the Companies; and theywill then be submitted to the Board of Trado witha view to the final payment of compensation. (Thequestion of interim payments on account is a separatematter which need not now be considered.)Before being finally passed for payment the certifiedclaims will be referred to a Consulting Accountantwhose duty it will be to satisfy himself that theprinciples laid down in the memorandum have beenduly observed and generally to secure proper con-sideration of the methods adopted more particularlyin regard to such matters as depreciation and theallocation of charges between Revenue Account andCapital Account.Tho Board contomplato that tho Consulting Ac-countant, while relying in the main on tho certificatesof the Professional Auditors of the Companies andconducting detailed investigations only if and whenquestions ariso in course of his examination whichmay appear to make such investigation necessary,should bo generally responsible for seoing that thoclaims are in order.It is proposed that tho Consulting Accountant shouldreceive an inclusive fee of 500 guineas for such periodnot exceeding twelve months as the present arrange-ments may continue. Such fee would cover allordinary out of pocket expenses (which are notexpected to be considerable) apart from those ofspecial investigations on detailed audits whioh ifrequired would be separately arranged for.The Board would be glad if you would accept thoposition of Consulting Accountant on these terms.As already indicated, it is not intended that youshould conduct a complete re-examination of all theaccounts; but it would be desirable that you shouldsatisfy yourself primd facie, that the Instructions,&amp;c, have boon duly carried out; and certain pointssuch as the treatment of depreciation and mainten-ance, transfers to and from special funds, with-drawals of stock, and tho allocation of charges forthe month of August would require special attention.The correspondence between the Government and thoCompanies, giving further details, would of course,be placed at your disposal.Sir William Plendor would bo willing to act withyou in regard to the Accounts of the Companies towhich Messrs. Price, Waterhouse and Company actas Auditors.I. am, &amp;c.,(Sd.)     W. F. MARWOOB,J. Gurney Fowler, Esq., F.C.A.c/o Messrs.

The   estimate   of* Appendix X. 13,500,000 was prepared ou broad lines and before anexamination of the individual Companies figurescould be made.

In one Company alonethis accounts for  300,000 in the first ninemonths of 1920.)Note. While the total figures may be taken ;isapproximately correct there are a number of disturb-ing factors operating in each direction, e.g.:  It is assumed that, either each Company will be inarrear on each Abstract as a whole, or the arrears ofrenewals will be made good in control; andthe additional cost in respect of work sent to Con-tractors over and above assumed 200 per cent, in-crease is disregarded.

We arearranging accordingly.With regard to your enquiry as to what sums theRailway Companies anticipate will be required inrespect of accrued Arrears of Maintenance to be over-taken in tho year 1921/22 after due allowance for thepayments already made on account, the Associationhave no information as to what work in arrear islikely to be carried out between tho 5th April, 1921,and 5th April, 1922, but they areobtain   approximate   figures   ofCompanies.It is perhaps right that I should remind you thatapart from Arrears of Maintenance carried outduring 1921/22 there are other liabilities of thoGovernment which will mature at the end of con-trol, amongst which are:  (1) Any liability under the Act of 1871 and/orunder the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919.(2) The increased cost of Arrears of Maintenanceand Renewal Work (Abstracts &quot; A &quot; and&quot; B &quot;) outside the above estimate for1921/22.(3) The Arrears of Maintenance and Renewals inrespect of Abstracts other than &quot; A &quot; and&quot; B.&quot;(4) The increased cost of a similar quantity ofStores to those on hand at 4th August, 1914.(5) Abnormal Wear and Tear not made goodduring the period of Control.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)

Statement submitted by Sir Alexander Guns.I. The statement submitted deals with the Bail-way Agreement only in so far as it relates to mattersaffecting engineering. It does not traverse all theinterpretations put upon the Agreement whichoperate unfairly against tho Government. Tho fewexamples given of cases which involve large amountsshow the necessity for revision and a careful scrutinyof the present interpretations of tho Agreement frombeginning to end.The data and reasons upon which tho statementsand opinions given hereafter have been founded aregivon at full length in the Appendices.II. Conclusions.The conclusions reached are:  (1) That the financial arrangement between thoGovernment and tho railway companies isas set forth in Sir Herbert Walkor&apos;s letterto the President of the Board of Tradedated 6th August, 1914.(2) That all interpretations thereof should bo inharmony with this basic agreement of6th August, 1914.(3) That many of the present interpretations arenot in harmony with tho true intentionof the Agreement.(4) That as these interpretations were made tomeet the circumstances which existed at thetimo they were arrived at, they can onlybe regarded as a &quot; war expedient&quot; andought now to bo modified to meet thechanged circumstances.(5) The general conviction reached after workingupon tho interpretations to the RailwayAgreement made from time to time,especially the later ones, is that theyincline towards a &quot; betterment ofbargain &quot; in favour of the railway com-panies.(6) That the total expenditure on maintenanceand renewal of all tho controlled railwaysshould be limitod to the 1913 quantum.(7) That the onus of proof for any extra paymentfor such claims as abnormal wear and teardue to Government control should rest onthe railway companies.HI. Agreement.(Cf. pp. 3 to 8 of Appendix XlVa.)Whether the Agreement of 6th August, 1914, wason the whole fair and reasonable alike to both parties,or not, it had the following advantages to the rail-way companies from an engineering point of view:  (1) The basis year 1913 was a specially advan-tageous one. According to the Board ofTrade Blue Book the net receipts for theyear 1913 exceeded the average of the nineprevious years by  7,000,000, which aftermaking allowance for interest on additionalcapital may be reduced to  6,000,000.Taking the seven years&apos; control, this givesan advantage to the railway companies ofapproximately  40,000,000, or nearly11 per cent, on tho net receipts. It almostinvariably happens that in a good yearmore money than usual is spent on re-pairs, renewals, &amp;c, and it is more thanprobable that this was tho case in 1913.(2) The railway companies are entitled to their1913 quantum for maintenance of way,works and rolling stock. As many repairsand renewals similar to those carried out in1913 (e.f/., painting of stations, bridges,&amp;o), could not be done during the warand will not now have to be undertaken tothe same extent, the 1913 quantum ofmaintenance for each year of control isan advantageous one..IV. Defects and Possible &quot;Remedies,(Cf. pp. 8 to 14 of Appendix XlVa.)The following are examples of interpretations un-fairly acting against the Government with certainsuggested remedies:  1.-(A) (Cf. page 8 of Appendix XlVa.) Thereis no limitation to the 1913 quantum of theexpenditure on repairs and maintenance ofway, works, plant and equipment, or onpartial renewals of these. This meansthat tho railways can spend what they likeon all these works and the Governmenthave to pay for it in the net receiptsguaranteed.(B) (Cf. pane 8 of Appendix XlVa.)  The limita-tion of renewals of permanent way and roll-iiig stock to the 1913 quantum can be easilycircumvented. This can bo done by exe-cuting complete renewals piece-meal andclassifying the work as partial renewals.The Government would, in this caso, haveto pay unlimited costs as shown in (A).Tho suggested remedy for the above two cases is tolimit the whole expenditure on way, works, plantand equipment to the 1913 quantum, as was un-doubtodly intended hy the Agreement of the 6thAugust, 1914, and to fix a definite time in which toovertake arrears.(C) (Cf. pane 8 of Appendix XlVa.)   Not only-have the Railway Companies been allowedthe increased cost of new toiling stock over1913 prices, but they interpret the instruc-tions as giving them a percentage (say5 per cent.) of the increased cost of suchrolling stock over their 1913 total cost onthe pica that replacement at the enhancedprices of rolling stock has to be providedalthough it is the Government who havepaid for this addition.The suggested remedy is to adhere to the obviousintention of Clause 4 as amended of the Memorandumof Instructions (Blue Book) and disallow the item.A rough approximation of the estimated extra, costto the Government if these three suggested alterationsare not made is  15,000,000. (This is for the samesaving as the  15,000,000 in par. 2.)2. (Cf. page 9 of Appendix XlVa.) The originalAgreement provided that the whole of theRailways wore to bo regarded as acollective entity. This principle has notbeen adhered to in regard to Arrears ofMaintenance of Way and Works (Abstract&quot; A! &quot;) and Rolling Stock (Abstract &quot; B &quot;),where not only is each Company dealt withindividually, but each Abstract is con-sidered separatelyThe result is that the Government paysfor all excess work over the 1913 quantumon each Abstract which may be in excess,and has also to make up the arrears oneach Abstract which may be in arrear atprices to be ascertained at the end ofcontrol, a payment on account being madein the meantime.A very rough estimate of the amount involved inthis item is  15,000,000 (same item as para. 1).The suggested remedy is to cancel the interpreta-tion and limit the total payment by the Governmentfor Maintenance and Renewal of Way, Works andEquipment to the 1913 quantum of all the Companies.If this course is taken then although the presentarrangements for payment in (A), (B) and (C) ofthe preceding clause were allowed to continue, theGovernment could still save what might amount to 15,000,000 because the amounts in excess in thecase of some companies would be charged against thearrears of other companies.
3. (Cf. page 9 of Appendix XlVa.)(a) (Cf. page 11 of Appendix XlVa.) Thepercentage arrived at in tho mannerprescribed in the Arrears of Main-tcnance formula to reduce the cost ofwork carried out in tho control periodto its 1913 equivalent, does not givea correct result, because it loaves out theimportant element of credits for re-coveredmaterials, i.e., scrap, otc., and is applied tofigures representing items of a differentnature and composition. This means thatthe amount of deferred work underAbstracts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; in any year,calculated by tho formula will bo greaterthan it should bo, and as tho.1913 amountwill have to bo multiplied by a co-efficientof probably between 3 and 4 to bring it upto prices current when tho work isexecuted, tho loss to the Government mayho very considerable.(b) (Cf. page 12 of Appendix XlVa.) Impor-tant items, such as Engine Power, etc.,charged in Abstracts &quot;A&quot; and original costof property displaced debited to Revenue,which are included in the Accounts for thoControl period at pre-war costs are subjectto a deduction in respect of increased costbefore comparison with tho 1913 standard.(c) (Cf. page 13 of Appendix XlVa.) The pro-vision that 80 per cent, of each of the threegroups into which tho Materials used onAbstract &quot; A &quot; work arc divided in theArrears of Maintenance Instructions hasnot boon adhered to by all the RailwayCompanies.(d) (Cf. pag.&apos;, 13 of Appendix XlVa.) The 80per cent, (in value) of materials issued andused is not a fair loading if companies canchoose their materials and limit themselvesto 80 per cent.The suggested remedy for the above four items is towork out a correct coefficient by taking all factorswhich are at present omitted into consideration.A rough approximation of tho extra cost to theGovernment if these alterations are not made is 14,000,000.4. (Cf. page 14 of Appendix XlVa.) There is noincentive to economy on the part of theRailway Companies, because their 1913 NetReceipts being guaranteed, any expend-ituro &quot; above the line&quot; falls on theGovernment; the latter has at the momentno efficient check on such expenditure. Theimportance of this will be realised when itis stated that on an approximate roughestimate of the total expenditure of theRailway Companies for the Seven years ofcontrol, viz.:  1,200,000,000, even 5 percent, gives  60,000,000.5. (Cf. page 14 of Appendix XlVa.) As theMinistry of Transport has, with theadvice of the Rates Advisory Com-mittee increased both rates and fareswith a view to meet the increasedexpenditure duo to the economic conditionsnow prevailing, including the increasedcost of Stores, the Railway Companies donot appear to bo entitled to receive fromthe Government a payment which willput them in the position of having at theend of the control period the same quan-tity of Stores on hand as they had at 4thAugust, 1914, at pre-war prices especiallyas that will give them the additionaladvantage of being able to realise thehigh market prices from the serviceableand scrap materials to be recovered fromtheir Way and Works when the low-pricedmaterials are used on Maintenance andRenewal.The suggested remedy is that a new arrangementshould he made. The stores arrangement was enteredinto in 1916 to meet tho circumstances then ruling;as theso circumstances have completely changed andthe railway companies have a quid pro quo, theGovernment may fairly claim that thoy (the railwaycompanies) should not bo paid for the increase in thestores twice over.In any event the railway companies are not entitledto tho enhanced value of the credits from recoveredmaterials corresponding to the quantity of stores onhand at pre-war prices.If the arrangement is revised as suggested above,the saving  to   the  Government is  estimated  at 20,000,000.   The enhanced value of the recoveredmaterials over pre-war prices is estimated at 5,000,000.V. Justification for revising the interpretation ofthe Agreement.Thoro appears to be ample justification lor re-opening and revising the interpretations of the Agree-montin all the cases mentioned in para. IV. Dealingwith these in turn :  Paragraph IV. (1) (a) and (b).At tho time those interpretations wore madethoro promised to bo such a shortage of manpower in tho country that it would have beenvirtually impossible, for tho railway companies toexceed the 1913 quantum to any appreciable ox-tont; in fact, if tho whole of tho railways hadbeen dealt with as an entity it would have beenabsolutely impossible. At the present time, how-over, when tho number of unemployed is increasingdaily, there is every opportunity and encourage-mont for railway companies to spend moneyon improvements of their way, works, plant andequipment, more especially if the Government arepaying for it.The whole spirit and intention throughout theinterpretation shows that the predominant con-sidoration was to safeguard the railway coin-panics in tho event of thoir not being able toovertake their maintenance work. There was atthe time no possibility of railway companies beingable to get into excess and further it must beremembered that the railways were in possessionof the Government on a weekly warrant and noone contemplated that control would continueafter tho war, as at that time Mr. Runciman&apos;sletter of 5th September 1916, had not beenwritten.Paragraph IV. (1) (c).As regards the practice of railway companiesto charge the Government a percentage of theincrease in the cost of rolling stock as a deprecia-tion item while at the same time they are beingpaid for the whole of the increase in Abstracts Aand B; at the time this was introduced therecould have been no thought in the minds of theparties that this matter would be so treated orthat prices would soar to their present high level;further, what in the early part of the war mighthave been a negligible factor, owing to the abnor-mal and unprecedented rise in prices and tho factthat rolling stock can now be built to an extentfar exceeding that in war-time, has now becomean important item. Moreover, it cannot be seenthat the present interpretation of the Agreementcould evor have been regarded as fair or asCarrying out the spirit of the Agreement.Paragraph IV. (2).With regard to the railways being dealt withindividually instead of collectively, the same re-marks apply as in paragraph IV. (1) (a) and (b).At tho time this interpretation was given therewas a great scarcity of men, now there is a sur-plus.
Paragraph IV. (3).The method of arriving at the co-efficient bywhich each controlled year&apos;s cost of work chargedto Abstracts A and B was to bo multiplied in orderto reduce the cost to 1913 values, i.e., taking 80per cent, of materials only and not taking intoaccount other elements, such as scrap, enginepower, etc., which are intimately involved, wasprobably agreed to because it was considered tobe a quick, if rough-and-ready method of obtain-ing tho results required. If any more complexmethod had boon employed it would have eitherthrown extra work on an already depicted stall,or extra clerks would have been required, whichwould have reduced the number of staff availablefor tho fighting linos, and for national service.As there is no shortage of staff at the present daythere seems to bo no reason why this temporarymethod, which has proved to bo inaccurate, shouldnot be replaced by an accurate mothod whichcarries out the true intent of the Agreement.Paragraph IV. (4).Whereas during the war it would have boon verydifficult for a railway company to be extravaganton account of the shortage of men and materials,circumstances are now entirely altered. It shouldbo remembered that a form of Agreomont whichwas more or less innocuous during the war, may inthe present normal times become very dangerousand this factor should be borne in mind in dealingwith the whole situation.APPENDIX XlVa.Appendices to Statement submitted bySir Alexander Gmn.Note. The numbers and letters at the head ofeach section refer to the corresponding numbers andletters in Appendix XIV.Agreement.(c.f.* Sections l-lll of Appendix XIV.)The principal railways in Great Britain were takenover by the Government as from midnight 4th-5thAugust, 1914, under the Regulations of the ForcesAct, 1871, and placed under the instructions of aRailway Executive Committee. It was speedily feltboth by the Railway Executive Committee and theGovernment that from all points of view the questionof the compensation due to the railway companiesunder Section 16 of that Act should be settledimmediately. The &quot; Net Receipts &quot; agreement wasaccordingly drafted on broad lines on the 6th August,1914, as follows:-F. 175. Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street,Westminster, S.W.6th August, 1914.Dear Sir,The Executive Committee has received from Mr.Marwood an intimation that the Government arcprepared to agree that the question of the compensa-tion to the Railway Companies, arising under theAct of 1871, should be adjusted on the followingbasis :  To ascertain the compensation payable theaggregate net receipts of all the Railways takenover during the period for which they are takenover shall be compared with a similar aggregatefor the corresponding period of the previous year.The ascertained deficiency shall be the amountof compensation  due.    Provided that  if theaggregate net receipts for the first half of theyear 1914 are less than the aggregate net receiptsfor the first half of the year 1913, the ascertaineddeficiency shall be reduced in the like proportion.Any question as to the amount of the deficiencyshall, in default of agreement, be determined bythe Railway and Canal Commission.I have to inform you that the Executive Committeehave resolved to recommend to the Companies, whoseBoards will be summoned at the earliest possiblemoment, the acceptance of this proposal,Yours faithfully,(Signed) H. A. Walker,Acting Chairman of the RailwayExecutive Committee.The President,Board of Trade.Two days later, the Railway Executive Committee(Circular Letter No. 10 of 8th August, 1914) recom-inonded all the controlled railway companies to acceptit stating they were satisfied the basis of compensationaccepted by the Government was not only just butgenerous, and that any difficulties in detail in givingeffect to tho Agreement would be subsequently dealtwith by a Sub-Committee of Accountants. On 13thAugust, 1914 (Circular Letter No. 19), tho RailwayExecutive Committee advised the controlled railwaycompanies that practically all the companies hadaccepted the Agreement and gave the broad ideaunderlying it. Sir Herbert Walker&apos;s letter of 9thAugust, 1914, and the Railway Executive Committee&apos;sCircular Letter (No. 19) of 13th August, 1914, asunder, show the interpretation of the Agreement inthe minds of the Railway Executive Committee at thetime the Agreement was completed:  F. 175. Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street,Westminster, S.W.9th August, 1914.Dear Sir,We understand from the statements you made tous to-day that there is some apprehension on the partof the Advisers of the Government that advantagemay bo taken by some companies of the settlementprovisionally come to with the Government as to thebasis of compensation under Section 16 of the Regula-tion of Forces Act, 1871, to spend abnormal sumsout of revenue on the maintenance and renewal oftheir lines and stock.I have to say that while the Executive Committeecannot believe that any Company would be capableof acting in such a manner, they have from the firstregarded it as an obligation of honour to protectthe Government against the possibility of such anevent, and they had before your visit already takensteps to safeguard the position of the Governmentin this respect.Yours faithfully,(Signed) H. A. Walker,Acting Chairman, Executive Committee.The President,Board of Trade.Instruction No. 19.Railway Executive Committee,* 35, Parliament Street,Westminster, S.W.13th August, 1914.Dear Sir,The Executive Committee are pleased to be able toannounce that practically all the companies whoserailways have been taken over by the Governmenthave agreed to the proposal outlined in my letter ofthe 8th instant, under which the Governmentguarantee the net receipts of the railways collectively.It is hardly necessary to point out that the arrange-ment is one which, in spite of its great convenienceboth to themselves and the companies, the Govern-ment could not have agreed to, had they not beenassured of the absolute good faith of the Companies,and had they not felt certain that they could relyon all officers of the companies concerned actingloyally up to the spirit of tho arrangement.Broadly speaking, the idea underlying the arrange-ment is that the financial results to each companyfor the period of Government control shall be the3201 (iB
same as if the railways had remained under thecontrol of the companies and the receipts and ex-penses of each railway had been the same as theywere in the corresponding period of tho previous year,subject to a deduction proportionate to any fallingoff in not receipts disclosed by the accounts of thecompanies as a whole for the first half-year of 1914.The result is that, during the period of Governmentcontrol the advantage of all economies will enure tothe benefit of the Government, and, correspondingly,tho whole burden of expenditure will fall on them.This state of things obviously imposes an honour-able obligation upon the companies to see that allproper economies are made, and that no abnormal orunnecessary expenditure is incurred.The new position thus created will give rise tomany questions of detail, and the executive com-mittce have asked a Committee of Accountants toconsider these and to make recommendations on thesubject for the guidance of the companies concerned,but thoy think it may be helpful if they indicatenow one or two points of general application.It may be that on the lines of some companiestraffic will fall off considerably and there will not bework for all the companies&apos; employees. In such casesit would obviously be unfair to keep on unnecessarymen at tho expense of the Government. On the otherhand, the Government may be anxious, from anational point of view, to avoid adding to tho un-employment in the country; and, the line of actionto bo taken therefore, is clearly one for tho Govern-ment to lay down, and the Executive Committee arein communication with them on the subject.In the meantime, the Executive Committee will beglad if you will communicato with them if you feelin doubt as to the course to be taken with regard toany considerable body of men for whom you have nowork or not full work. The allowances to the familiesof men called out for active servicce involved a similarquestion upon which you have already been advised.Again, it may be found that certain trains havebecome unnecessary or have ceased to be remunera-tive. In these cases the Government will naturallyoxpect each Company to reduce its train service fromtime to time so far as it can reasonably do so.Then again, questions may arise as to the amountto be expended on the maintenance and renewal ofway and works, or rolling stock. Under these headsit will not be open to a Company to include in itsworking expenses any greater sum than is requiredto maintain its works and plant in an efficient con-dition, including due alloioance for renewals, and ifthe expenditure of any Company upon any item ofmaintenance exceeds the corresponding figure in theprevious year, the Government will no doubt, in theabsence of special justification, expect it to be shownthat the additional expenditure was renderednecessary by their requirements, or by the exceptionalcharacter or quantity of the traffic carried during theperiod of Government control. This point has beendefinitely raised by the Treasury, and the ExecutiveCommittee have had no hesitation in giving anassurance, on behalf of all the Companies taken over,that no unfair advantage will be taken of the presentsituation in connection with the renewal of worksor plant.All these and similar questions will be consideredin detail by the Accountants, but it is thought wellby the Executive Committee to indicate at the out-set the general features of the new situation, and tolet the Companies know what the Government arelooking to them to do.Yours faithfully,(Signed) H. A, Walker,Acting Chairman, Executive Committee.The General Manager,Railway.(The letter of the 8th inst. referred to above wasaddressed to your Secretary.)The basis year, 1913, was a specially advantageousone for the Railway Companies, On page xvii. ofthe Blue Book of Railway Returns for 1913, issuedby the Board of Trade in 1915 (Cd.8038), it isstated:  &apos;.&apos; It is clear, however, from the statistics avail-&quot; able, that in 1913 the railway companies en-&quot; joyed a considerable measure of prosperity.&quot; Prom the shareholders&apos; point of view one of the&quot; best indices of the net result of railway work-&quot; ing in a particular year is that afforded by the&quot; statistics showing the average rate per cent.&quot; per annum of the dividend paid by the com-&quot; panics collectively on their ordinary capital.&quot; During the nine years ending 1912 the average&quot; rate paid on tho total ordinary capital (exclu-&quot;sive of nominal additions), whether ranking&quot;for dividend or not, was 4.08 per cent., the&quot; highest annual average being 4.45 in 1911, and&quot; the lowest 3.67 in 1908. Tho average for th*&quot; year 1913 was 4.60. The basis of the rate was&quot; slightly altered as botween 1912 and 1913, but&quot; tho alteration does not appreciably affect the&quot; comparison.&quot;The Net Income of the Railways in the UnitedKingdom for the year 1913 is shown on page xii. oftho same book as  52,131,000, and the average netReceipts for tho ten previous years (see page xxxiv.)works out at  44,973,000, or a difference of roughly 7,000,000, which after making, allowance for intereston additional capital during the period may hereduced to  6,000,000. Taking the seven years ofControl, this gives an advantage to tho RailwayCompanies of approximately  40,000,000, or nearly11 per cent, per annum of tho not Income for 1913.According to Board of Trade Statistical Returnsfrom 1903 to 1917, issued in 1919 (Cd.491), the totalimports for 1913 amounted to  768,734,739, against 623,306,890, the average of the previous ten years,being an increase of  145,427,849, or 23 per cent.,while the total exports for 1913 amounted to 634,820,326, against  473,387,857, the average ofthe previous ten years, being an increase of 161,432,469, or 34 per cent.It almost invariably happens that in a good yearmore money than usual is spent on repairs, renewals,etc., and it is more than probable that this was thecase in 1913.The railway companies are entitled to their 1913quantum for maintenance of way, works and rollingstock. As many repairs and renewals similar to thosecarried out in 1913 (e.g., painting of stations,bridges, etc.) could not be done during the war andwill not now have to be undertaken to the sameextent, the 1913 quantum of maintenance for eachyear of control is an advantageous one.Interpretations of the Agreement from anEngineering Point of View.(1) Memorandum of Instructions (Blue Book).Between August, 1914, and January, 1915, thedetailed arrangements to give effect to the Agree-ment were worked out by the Sub-Committee ofAccountants appointed by the Railway ExecutiveCommittee and the Board of Trade. These are em-bodied in a Blue Book entitled:&quot; Memorandum  of  Instructions  to  Railway&quot; Companies for the preparation of the Accounts&quot;to be presented by each Controlled Company&quot; to arrive at the amount of Compensation pay-&quot; able by His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;This Book was issued with the authority of theTreasury to the controlled railway companies inMarch, 1915.   Apart from the recital of. the Agree-ment and the definition of the term &quot; net receipts&quot;in Clauses 1 and 2, the only clauses in the &quot; Blue &quot;Book which are of importance from an engineeringpoint of view are the following:  Clause 4.&quot; The expenditure chargeable for the control&quot; period must be ascertained as far as it is pos-&quot; siblc to do so, with the proviso that the amount&quot; charged for the renewal of permanent way and&quot; rolling stock is not to exceed the amount in-&quot; eluded in, the corresponding period of 191S,&quot; except under special circumstances, such as&quot; additions to the length of line opened, addi-&quot; tions to rolling stock in service, or an increase&quot; in the cost of renewal work carried out during&quot; the period resulting from increased price of&quot; labour and materials,&quot;
Clause, 4 (c), Provisions for Estimated Expendi-ture.  Liabilities.&quot; In determining the amount of revenue ex-&quot; penditure for the control period, each company&quot; must follow strictly the method which regulated&quot; the preparation of the accounts in 1913, and&quot; provisions to be made should be proportionate&quot; to the sums necessary for the half-year ended&quot; 31st December, 1913. Particularly should this&quot; principle be observed in setting up reserves for&quot; depreciation or provisions for maintenance of&quot; locomotives, carriages and wagons, permanent&quot; way, bridges, stations, etc.&quot;It soon became apparent to the Railway ExecutiveCommitteo that Clause 4 was operating unfairly asbetween &quot;Programme&quot; and &quot;Non-programme&quot;companies, because under Clause 4 (c) companieswhich had a programme of renewals in 1913 couldcharge in their accounts their corresponding pro-gramme of renewals in the control period up to the1913 standard whether the work was carried out ornot, while Non-programme Companies could onlycharge the cost of Renewals actually performed, not-withstanding the fact that owing to tho shortage oflabour and materials duo to the war, they found itimpossible to accomplish their 1913 renewal standard.Tho Railway Executive Committee thereforeapproached the Government Auditors, and on 28tliSeptember, 1916, the following agreed interpretationof Clause 4 in tho Blue Book was issued to tho con-trolled Railway Companies, with effect from 1stJanuary, 1915,&quot; Memorandum of Instructions to Railway&quot; Companies for the Preparation of tue&quot; Accounts to be Presented by each Con-&quot; trolled Company to Arrive at the Amount&quot; of Compensation Payable by His Majesty&apos;s&quot; Government.&quot; Scheduled   to    Railway    Executive   Committee&quot; Instruction No. 214.&quot; Agreed interpretation of Article 4 so far as&quot; it relates to the amount chargeable for the con-&quot; trol period in respect of the renewal of&quot; permanent way and rolling stock &quot; All companies are entitled to include in their&quot; Abstracts of Expenditure, A and B, in respect&quot; of the renewal of permanent way and rolling&quot; stock respectively, an amount equal to, but not&quot; exceeding, the amount so charged in the corre-&quot; sponding period of 1913, together with such&quot; additional sums as(1) may be necessary to make provision forthe renewal of(a) additional mileage of line, or(b) additional units or increased first costof rolling stock in service;(2) may be attributable to increased rates ofpay or prices of materials paid in respectof renewals carried out during the periodand chargeable against the Government.&quot;It is recommended that the agreed interpre-&quot; tation should take effect as from 1st January,&quot; 1915, and that any necessary adjustment of&quot;the claims for the year 1915 should be made&quot; the subject of a supplementary claim.&quot;This interpretation put Programme and Non-programme Companies on practically the same levelso far as renewals of permanent way and rollingstock were concerned. As from the year 1916 therailway companies charged the Government with theincreased cost over 1913 prices of renewals carriedout in excess of the 1913 standard of renewals. Therailway companies also discovered that the BlueBook made no provision for the depreciation andmaintenance of additional works and plant otherthan permanent way and rolling stock brought intouse during and subsequent to 1913. On 9thSeptember, 1920, the Ministry of Transport and theTreasury approved of percentage rate for deprecia-tion and maintenance of these additional works, etc.,and these rates were issued to the railway companieson 13th September, 1920, with effect from 5th August.1914.32046(2) Arrears of Maintenance and Renewal of Plantand Equipment.(a) Way Works and Stations (Abstract A) and Itvll-ing Stock (Abstract li).(Yellow, Heliotrope, Green, and Brown Books.)The Net Receipts Agreemont had only boon twomonths in operation when the Railway ExecutiveCommittee on 27th October, 1914, intimated to thoBoard of Trade that as the result of their LocomotiveCarriage and Wagon Shops being placed at tho dis-posal of tho Government for the manufacture ofarticles urgently required by the War Office or Ad-miralty, the Railway Companies&apos; usual repair andrenewal work was necessarily postponed and thatsooner or later tho Companies might have to includein their claim against the Government a sum to cover&apos;the cost of the work which was so deferred and whichwould have to be overtaken. Early in 1916, it wasagreed between the Government and tho RailwayCompanies that payment should be made monthly inrespect of the ultimate cost of carrying out the arrearsof repairs and renewuls arising during the Covern-ment Control period, so far as Abstracts A and B wereconcerned. The Government further agreed that forthe Control period from 5th August to 31st December,1914, and for the year 1915, an addition of 12J percent, might bo made to the arrears to cover increasedoutlay which might havo to be incurred whon thearrears of work wore ultimately carried out. Separateclaims for arrears had to be made in respect ofAbstracts A and B. The basis of the Claim forArrears Avas the amount by which the expenditurein the Government Control period fell short of thetotal of the Abstract for the corresponding poriodof 1913, after making allowance for(1) the difference between rates of wages andbetween prices of materials in the twoperiods;(2) any increased cost due to additional lengthof line opened or additions to rolling stockin service;(3) any additional expenditure incurred duringthe period of Government Control as theresult of abnormal wear and tear duringsuch period.The relative instructions for the period from5th August, 1914, and for the year 1915, were printedin a &quot; Yellow &quot; Book and issued by the RailwayExecutive Committee to the controlled Railway Com-panies with Circular Letter No. 483, dated25th January, 1916. These instructions are very com-plicated and are also highly technical, involving anexpert knowledge of engineering as well as thoroughgrasp of &quot; costing.&quot; The &quot; Yellow &quot; Book is printedin extenso on pages 59-63 of the Volume of &quot; PrincipalLetters and Documents relating to the General Rail-way Agreements (Great Britain).&quot;* On 3rd April, 1916,the Railway Executive Committee issued with theirCircular Letter No. 536 a &quot; Heliotrope &quot; Book (seepages 64-71 of the volume above referred to),* givingan example of the application of the instructionscontained in the &quot; Yellow &quot; Book, together with fur-ther detailed particulars of the method to be adoptedby each Company for arriving at the allowance forincreased rates of wages and prices of materials.It was understood by both parties to the agreementthat the payments made by .the Government inrespect of arrears of work on Abstracts A and B forthe Control period of 1914 and for the year 1915,including the 12J per cent, addition in respect ofincreased costs were in full settlement of the claimsfor these two periods. It was subsequently found bythe Railway Executive Committee owing to the pro-longatien of tho period of control and the uncertaintyas to its duration, that this settlement in full wasunbusinesslike and very uncertain in its operationbecause it was obviously impossible to fix a figurefair alike to the Railway Companies and the Govern-ment in respect of the increased cost of repairs atthe date they would ultimately be carried out. Itwas therefore suggested that the payments made forthe period up to 31st December, 1915, shoidd betreated as a payment on account only. The Treasury,on 26th June, 1917, agreed to re-open the question as* Appendix I.J92
from, the commencement of the control and to regardall payments hitherto nuule, including those inrespect of 1914 and 1915, as payments on account.In the &quot; Green &quot; Book, issued with the RailwayExecutive Committee&apos;s Circular Letter No. 1400, thefollowing interpretations were issued:  (1) that the addition to be made to the arrearson account oi the increased outlay whichmay have to be incurred when the arrearsof work aro ultimately carried out shouldbe at tho rate of 15 per cent, over thewhole control period;(2) that no Company would be entitled to retainor receive any amount in respect of Arrearsof Maintenance unless there were arrearsof work for the whole period of control.Those Companies which were in excess atthe end of one year and in arrcar at theend of the next, have to deduct the amountin excess from the amount in arrear. Simi-larly, those Conpanies which were in arrearat tho end of one year and in excess at theend of the next, have to refund the amountof such excess, with the proviso that theamount so refunded does not exceed theamount received by the Company in respectof the arrears to the end of the previousyear. Abstracts A and B aro each dealtwith separately for the purpose of theseadjustments.The &quot; Green &quot; Book embodying these amendmentsalso contained tho following modifications of thoinstructions in the &quot; Yellow &quot; Book in their applica-tion to the arrears claim for the year 1916 :  Clause 2 (&quot; Green &quot; Hook).New Lines Opened and Additions to BolliHyStock in Service.The instruction in the &quot; Yellow &quot; Book inregard to &quot; Programme &quot; and &quot; Non-pro-gramme &quot; Companies (Clause 4) (c) was amendedto put both classes of companies on the samefooting in accordance with the agreed interpreta-tion of Clause 4 of the &quot; Blue &quot; Book (see page5 above).Clause 3 (&quot; Green&quot; Book).Reduction in Numbers of Boiling Stock inService.If the numbers of rolling stock in service at31st December of a control year were loss thanthe numbers in service at 31st December, 1913,an adjustment to be made in the expenditure togive effect to this disparity in numbers unless itcan be shown that the capacity or first cost oftho rolling stock in service at the end of thecontrol year is not less than tho capacity or firstcost of the vehicles existing at the end of 1913.Engines, carriages and wagons to be dealt withseparately for the purposes of this adjustment.Clause 4 (&quot; Green &quot; Boolt).Boiling Stock Built or Repaired otherwise thanin the Companies&apos; Workshops.As the additional cost of renewing and repair-ing rolling stock by contractors, instead of in thecompanies&apos; workshops as was the pre-warpractice, would not be represented by thepercentage foi increased cost of work donearrived at in accordance with the instructions,such additional cost was to form the subject of aseparate adjustment.In tho &quot; Yellow &quot; Book this concession was limitedto rolling stock built by contractors, but in practiceit is understood that the extra cost of repairingrolling. stock by contractors in 1915 was also allowed.Clause 5 (&quot; Green &quot; Book).Additional Bcncwal or Depreciated Provisionsother than in respect of New Lines and I orBoiling Slock. .This instruction appeared in the &quot; Green &quot;Book in 1918, although the detailed percentagesfor arriving at the depreciation of the propertyconcerned were not finally adjusted untilSeptember, 1920. it was apparently agreed inprinciple in 1918 that the companies wero entitledto this depreciation under the &quot; Net Receipts &quot;Agreement, and as a transaction in AbstractsA or B under that Agreement affects the financialresults under the &quot; Arrears &quot; Agreement, pro-vision was made in the &quot; Arrears &quot; instructionsfor 1916 to bring the &quot; Arrears &quot; claims in thisrespect in line with the &quot; Net Receipts &quot; claims.Clause 6 (&quot; Green &quot; Book).Special Expenditure incurred in the Liftingand Restoration of Permanent Way due toShortage of Materials.In cases where a company, owing to theshortage of materials, lifted rails, etc., from a*less important to a more important section ofthe line, tho additional expense incurred was toform the subject of a special adjustment forarrears of maintenance purposes.Clause 7 (&quot; Green &quot; Book).Transfers to or from Depreciation Funds orSuspense Accounts.Under the 1915 formula, renewal expenditurein excess of programme and chargeable againstthe companies&apos; own funds, had to be deductedfrom the commencing figure in the formula, in1916 the renewal expenditure in excess of pro-gramme and chargeable against the companies&apos;own funds was adjusted at the foot of theformula, the difference being that in 1915 therailway companies bore the total cost of theexcess work, while in 1916 they only bore the1913 cost, the increased cost over 1913 beingborne by the Government.Clauses 9 to 12 (&quot; Green &quot; Book).Allowance for Increased Bates of Wages andMaterials.These clauses are in the main, with oneexception, the same as the supplementaryinstructions contained in the &quot; Heliotrope &quot;Book for 1915, with some verbal alterations tosuit the altered conditions of the following years.The exception is in regard to the method ofarriving at the minimum of 80 per cent, (invalue) of the materials used in Abstract A, andthe instructions for 1915 and 1916 are shownbelow in parallel columns:  1915. 1916.A.bstract A. Materials.In determining the mini-mum of 80% (in value)referred to in the Instruc-tions, the gross debit forthe materials issued andused at the actual issueprices   i.e., before takingcredit for scrap materials re-turned-should be adoptedas the basis for the totalvalue of the materials main-ly charged to Abstract A,divided into the followinggroups:-(1) Permanent   WayMaterials  (includingElectric Track Ecpuip-ment).(2) Signal and TelegraphMaterials.(3) Sundry Materials. Stations,  BuildingRoads and Bridges,and all other materialsnot coming under (1)or (2).It is admitted that if in 1915 a minimum of 80per cent, in each of the specified groups was adoptedby all the Companies in accordance with the instruc-tion, a similar result would more or less automaticallyfollow under the 1916 Instruction, but it is under-stood that in 1915 the Railway Executive CommitteeAbstract A.

So far aspossible, the materialsselected for the year 1916,should correspond with thematerials selected in thecase of 1915 Arrears State-meat.
did not insist on all the Railways having a minimumof 80 per cent, in each group of materials so long asa minimum of 80 per cent, of the total materials issuedand used was arrived at.In 1918 the Instructions contained in the &quot; Yellow,&quot;&quot;Heliotrope&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; Books were consoli-datod in a &quot;Brown&quot; Book and issued on 13thDecember, 1918, to the Railway Companies, asapplicable to the Year 1917 and subsequent periods.The &quot; Brown &quot; Book contains tho further followingmodification of the previous instructions.Clause 8 (&quot; Brown &quot; Book),Reduction in Mileage of Line open for Traffic.In tho event of a reduction in miles of lineopen for traffic in consequence of Permanent WayMaterials having been sent to Prance or other-wise, an adjustment had to be made to give effectto this reduction unless it could be shown thatthe circumstances did not justify an adjustment.The instructions in  the  &quot; Brown &quot; Book wereapplied to the Arrears Claims for 1917 and 1918.Further minor modifications in the &quot; Brown &quot; Bookin its application to the Year 1919 were issued to theRailway Companies on  13th September,  1920,  asfollows:  Clause 8 (&quot; Brown &quot; Book).Reduction of Mileage of Line open for Traffic.Those Companies who  claimed  that eircum-stances did not justify an adjustment had to sub-mit full particulars of the reasons for not makingthe adjustment.Clause % (&quot; Brown &quot; Book).Up to the end of 1918, Companies&apos; RollingStock on loan to the War Department for serviceoverseas, were treated as Rolling Stock in Ser-vice, and no adjustment in respect of reductionin numbers was made in respect of these. Thiswas altered for 1919.Rolling Stock loaned to the Company by theGovernment.Any expenditure incurred on these during 1919to form tho subject of an adjustment for arrearsof maintenance purposes.Expenditure incurred in the Provision of Tem-porary Accommodation for Female Staff.Any expenditure incurred during the controlperiod on accommodation for female staff whichproves to be strictly temporary in its characterto form the subject of adjustment in the 1919claim for arrears of maintenance.(2) Arrears of Maintenance and Renewal op Plantand Equipment.(b) Works falling within the scope of the GeneralAgreement (&quot;above the line&quot;) and not includedin Abstracts A or B.On 27th October, 1916, in announcing to theBoard of Trade that all the railway companies hadassented to the Supplementary Clauses to theoriginal Agreement contained in the &quot;Pink&quot; Book(see Document No. 71, pages 89 to 94 of the OfficialVolume) the Railway Executive Committee intimatedthat the question of arrears of maintenance of worksother than permanent way, etc. (Abstract A), androlling stock (Abstract B) had been raised by somerailway companies especially in regard to the main-tenance of docks, and after some further correspon-dence the Treasury asked the Board of Trade toconvey to the railway companies their Lordships&apos;assurance &quot;that they recognise that the railwaycompanies will have a claim against His- Majosty&apos;sGovernment at the end of the period of tho war or atthe end of the period of control in regard to arrearsof maintenance in the case of works falling withinthe scope of the general agreement and not includedin any special arrangement now made or to bo madefor the payment of deferred maintenance.&quot;The application of this arrangement does not comeinto force until the end of the period of control andthe Government have, therefore, a free hand in regardto the detailed instructions for giving effect to theprinciple of the arrangement except in so far as theinstructions made in connection with Abstracts Aand B have prejudiced such freedom of action.(3) Interest on Capital Expenditure.On 14th November, 1916, the Railway ExecutiveCommittee issued to the railway companies a &quot;PinkBook,&quot; containing the supplementary clauses to theagreement with the Government, tho first clause ofwhich deals with interest on capital expenditure onworks brought into uso since 31st December, 1912, thorate of interest being 4 per cent. The companieswere allowed to be the judges as to what worksshould be charged to capital and as this is, in-the main, a purely financial arrangement, and as ithas been subsequently modified, as shown below, noremarks need be made from an engineering point ofview except to note, that while credit has to be givento the Government for the cost of works, replacedcredit has not to be given for the cost of worksdisplaced and not replaced.On the 7th May, 1919, the Railway Executive Com-mittee wrote tho President of tho Board of Tradesuggesting that if possible a now arrangement shouldbo come to with the Treasury in regard to capitalexpenditure, thoir objections to tho existing arrange-nient on financial grounds including:-(a) Tho inadequate amount allowed for intereston capital works brought into use, i.c.,4 per cent.(b) The fact that no interest is allowed until theworks are brought into use.(c) The heavy increased cost for carrying on thework at existing rates of wages and pricesof material.(d) The uncertainty as to how the railway com-panies will be recouped for such expendi-ture in the case of the Government decid-ing to take over the railways.On 3rd May, the Board of Trade intimated to theRailway Executive Committee that the Treasury wereprepared to agree to the undernoted arrangements :  (1) That in place of the present arrangementsbetween the railway companies and theGovernment with regard to the rate ofinterest to be allowed on new capital ex-penditure, interest at the rate of 5 percent, per annum from the date on whichthe expenditure is incurred may be allowedin respect of approved capital expenditure.(2) That an assurance may be given to the com-panies that in the event of their under-takings being acquired by the Governmenttho companies shall neither be financiallyprejudiced nor financially advantaged byreason of having incurred capital ex-pondituro under the present arrangements,These arrangements were advised to the railwaycompanies on the 15th August, 1919, per the RailwayExecutive Committee&apos;s Circular Letter No. 1930.This circular letter led to some misapprehension andon the 12th February, 1920, the Ministry of Trans-port defined tho situation as follows:  &quot; As regards works in hand before May, 1919,&quot; and also as regards works commenced between&quot; that dato and the 31st January, 1920, the rail-&quot; way companies may have the option of 4 per&quot; cent, interest on capital expended without the&quot; Minister^ approval, or 5 per cent, interest on&quot; capital expended with the Ministers approval.&quot; As regards works commenced on and after&quot; the 1st February, 1920, the right to claim 4&quot; per cent, without tho Ministers approval will&quot; lapse.&quot; Any regulations issued in connection with&quot; the work of tho Accountants Sub-Committee&quot; in regard to this or to any other point arising&quot; out of tho Railway Agreement, should first be&quot; approved by the Ministry.&quot;(4) Stores&apos; on hand at 4tti August, 1914.The arrangement in regard to these forms one ofthe Clauses in the Pink Book issued to the railwaycompanies in 1916, and is in the following terms:-32046
Stores.At the end of tho period of the Government control,a cash payment to be made by the Government toeach of the controlled companies equal to tho diiler-ence between (u) the book value of the stores in stockat the 5th August, 1914, and (6) the value of thesame quantities of similar stores calculated:  (1) As to tho extent those quantities are in stockat the end of the control period, s\t thebook values then ruling.(2) As to the shortage in tho quantity at the endof the control period as compared with thoquantity at the beginning, at replacementprices.The replacement prices to be agreed between theTreasury and the Railway Executive Committee asfairly representing the prices at which the shortagecould be made good, having regard to quoted marketprices at the end of the control period, tho probablemovement of prices and the other relevant circum-stances. Any amounts already received by tho com-panies for replacement valuo of material used on workdone for the Government must be brought intoaccount when fixing the amount to bo allowed underthis clause.&apos; Regulations in regard to the calculation of prices,the definition of stores, and generally as to givingeffect to this Clause, to be agreed botwoon thoGovernment Accountants and the Railway ExecutiveCommittee.(5) The Question of Compensation to ije given to theRailway Companies in respect of the use ofUncreosoted Sleepers.Owing to a shortage in the supply of creosote oilit became necessary for the railway companies to putuncreosoted sleepers into the permanent way. Onthe 27th June, 1917, the Railway Executive Com-mittee asked the Board of Trade for an assurancethat the railway companies would be compensated atthe end of the period of control for any depreciationof their property that might result from the use ofuncreosoted sleepers, and on the 30th July, 1918, theTreasury informed the Board of Trade that My Lordsare prepared to admit on principle the liability ofthe Exchequer for some compensation to the railwayson this account. The method of arriving at theamount of this compensation will be somewhat com-plicated, as it will involve a technical calculationbased on the average life of an uncreosoted sleepercompared with the average life of a creosoted sleeper.(6) Insurance of Railway Companies&apos;  Propertyagainst Fire.In this case the Government have arranged to paythe increased cost of repairing damage by fire to&quot; above the line &quot; property in those cases where theproperty was insured in Fire Insurance Funds be-longfing to the railway companies themselves.Defects   and   Possible   Remedies.(Cf. Section IV. of Appendix XIV.)It will be seen from the foregoing details that anyslight modifications in the original Arrears of Main-tenance Instructions iin favour of the Government,are well within the spirit of the agreement, while theinterpretations of the agreement and subsequentmodifications thereof in favour of the railway com-pandes range from important questions of principleto such comparatively trivial matters as temporaryaccommodation provided for female staff during thewar. The question will arise spontaneously : Was theagreement apparently so defective from the rail-way companies point of view so perfect from theGovernment point of view that no flaws in its appli-cation were or could be discovered?The following are examples of interpretations un-fairly acting against the Government with certainpossible remedies:  Memorandum of Instructions.Blue Book.(1) A.There is no instruction in the &quot; Blue &quot; Bookwhich limits the expenditure by the railway com-panies on repairs and partial renewals of way,works, plant and equipment, as was undoubtedlythe intention when the &quot; Net Receipts &quot; agree-ment was made in August, 1914. This seemsclear from the Railway Executive Committeo&apos;sletter of 9th August, 1914, to tho President oftho Board of Trade and from their CircularLetter No. 19 of 13th August, 1914, to the con-trolled railway companies. Some companies arealready largely in excess of their 1913 standard ofmaintenance after allowing for increased costsand other disturbing factors due to the war, andthe Government have, in tho meantime, paidover the money. On tho other hand, under thearrears of maintenance arrangement, the Govern-mont arc paying to those companies whoso main-tenance of way, works and stations (Abstract A)and/or rolling stock (Abstract B) is in arrear ontho basis of tho 1913 standard, the valuo of thowork in arrear at 1913 prices plus 15 per cent,as a payment on account of the ultimate in-creased cost when the work is overtaken. Notonly so, but a railway company in arrear withAbstract A and in excess with Abstract B, orvice versa, is being paid for the arrears inAbstract A notwithstanding that it has alreadybeen paid for the excess in Abstract B.(1) B.The limitation in regard to renewals of per-manent way and rolling stock in Clause 4 of the&quot; Blue &quot; Book both in its original form and asmodified by the Government accountant isillusory, and can be easily be circumvented. Re-newals of permanent way and rolling stock areunderstood by railway accountants to be limitedto complete renewals with new materials through-out. Permanent way, for instance, is made up ofrails, chair sleepers, fastenings, etc., and each ofthese classes of materials has a different &quot; life&quot;from the others; consequently it is a simplematter for an engineer to renew his sleepers andchairs at one period and his rails at another,classifying both transactions correctly as &quot; Par-tial Renewals &quot; for accounting purposes, althoughto all intents and purposes his permanent way hasbeen completely renewed. Similarly in regard torolling stock there is no difficulty in building acompletely new wagon with second-hand wheelsslightly worn and classifying the transaction cor-rectly for accounting purposes as a &quot; PartialRenewal.&quot; Partial renewals in both cases beingoutside the limitation imposed by Clause 4 of the&quot; Blue &quot; Book, the illusory nature of tholimitation will be readily appreciated.The suggested remedy for the above two cases is tolimit the whole expenditure on way works, plant andequipment to the 1913 quantum, and to fix a definiteterm in which to overtake arrears.(!) 0- .The amended interpretation of Clatise 4, quotedabove (see page 5), gives the railway companiesthe option of adopting either &quot; additional units &quot;or &quot; additional first cost of rolling stock in ser-vice,&quot; for calculating the sum necessary to makeprovision for the replacement of such &quot; additionalunits,&quot; or &quot; additional first cost.&quot; Those com-panies which adopt &quot; additional first cost&quot; notonly receive from the Government the increasedcost of new rolling stock over 1913 prices, but theyinterpret the Instruction as giving them a per-centage (say 5 per cent.) of the increased cost ofsuch rolling stock over thein 1913 total cost, onthe plea that replacement at the enhanced priceof the rolling stock has to be provided, althoughit is the Government who have paid for thisaddition.The suggested remedy is to adhere tot the obviousintention of Clause 4 as amended of the Memorandumof Instructions (Blue Book), and disallow the item.A rough approximation of the estimated extra costto the Government if these three suggested alterationsare not made is  15,000,000, arrived at as follows:-
The amount of excess maintenance  cost of way works and rolling stockfrom 5th August, 1914, to 31st Decem-bcr, 1919, over the 1913 quantum is es-timated by the Director General ofFinance and Statistics at actual coststo be        ...............  8,000,000For the remaining period of controlfrom 1st January, 1920, to 15th August,1921, tho amount of excess maintenanceat actual costs is estimated as doublethat for tho year 1919, viz.,  3,500,000 7,000,000Total    ...    15,000,000(This is for the same saving as the  15,000,000in para. 2.)2,Arrears of Maintenance Instructions.Abstracts A and B.(Yellow, Heliotrope, Green and Brown Books.)The original agreement provided that thewhole of tho railways were to be regarded as acollective entity. This principle has not beenadhered to in regard to Arrears of Maintenanceof Way and Works (Abstract &quot; A &quot;), and RollingStock (Abstract &quot; B &quot;), where not only is eachcompany dealt with individually, but eachAbstract is considered separately.The result is that the Government pays for allexcess work over the 1913 quantum on eachAbstract which may bo in excess, and has alsoto make up the arrears on each Abstract whichmay be in arrear at prices to be ascertained atthe end of control, a payment on account beingmade in the meantime.A very rough estimate of the amount involved inthis item is  15,000,000 (same item as para. 1).The suggested remedy is to cancel the interpreta-tion and limit the total payment by the Governmentfor maintenance and renewal of way, works, andequipment to the 1913 quantum of all the companies.If this course is taken, then although the presentarrangements for payment in (A), (B) and (G) of thepreceding clause were allowed to continue, tho Gov-ernment could still save what might amount to 15,000,000 because the amounts in excess in the caseof some companies would be charged against thearrears of other companies.From this point of view the undernoted CircularLetter No. 10, dated 8th August, 1914, from theRailway Executive Committee to the Controlled Rail-way Companies is important:  Instruction No. 10.Railway Executive Committee,35, Parliament Street,Westminster, S.W.8th August, 1914.Dear Sir, As you are aware, in connection with the takingover of the railways by the Government under thepowers of the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871,Section 16, there arises the question of the compen-sation payable under that section to each of the com-panies whose railways are taken over.It speedily became evident to the Executive Com-mittee that an immediate settlement of this questionif practicable upon terms fair to the railway com-panies and the State would be of enormous advantagefrom the point of view of the efficient working ofthe railways to tho best advantage of the nation, andalso from the point of view of the interests of thecompanies themselves.If the matter is adjusted now it is obvious thattwo advantages, the importance of which it isdifficult to exaggerate, will accrue.The Executive Committee will be in a position toexercise their functions with a single eye to thoefficient working of the railways without having toconsider the possible effect of any particular schemeof working upon the interests of the individual com-panies in reference to tho question of compensation.The preparation of elaborate accounts and returnsfor the purpose of establishing claims to compensa-tion hereafter will become unnecessary, and thepossibility will be avoided of arbitrations of great2204Rmagnitude and complexity, tho result of which wouldbe very uncertain.Theso are among the most important and obviousadvantages of an adjustment of the question ofcompensation now, as against leaving it in abeyance,but they by no means exhaust the advantages.Acting upon this view tho Executivo Committeehave been in negotiation with the Government onthe lines of some collective arrangement, which, whiledealing, in tho first instance, with the ascertain-inont in one sum of the compensation payable to allthe companies whose lines are taken over, shouldprovide also for the allocution to each company of itsproper proportion of the aggregate sum.A principal reason actuating the Government indesiring an arrangement on this basis was thenatural desire to be secured against a claim forcompensation by an individual company for their lossof traffic which had been merely transferred to theline of another company from causes arising out ofthe state of war.The Committee felt no difficulty in admitting as aprinciple that no company would be likely to wish toobtain an advantage out of a national emergency atthe expense of the nation, and though they did notshare the view of the Government that such a resultmight occur under the provisions of the Act abovereferred to, they felt that they ought to co-operatewith the Government in arriving at some arrange-ment which would remove all doubt or difficulty ofthis kind.The Executive Committee have now concluded pro-visionally, i.e., subject, of course, to the assent ofeach company concerned, an arrangement which isset forth in the accompanying minute of the 6thAugust, 1914*Tho Executive Committee, before concluding theprovisional arrangement with the Government, wereadvised by a Committee of Accountants, and aresatisfied that the basis of compensation accepted bytho Government is not only generally just butgenerous.Beyond this, however, the Executive Committeefrom their experience of the last few days areunanimously of opinion that it is impossible promptlyto carry out tho movements rendered necessary, veryoften at a few hours&apos; notice to meet the nationalomorgency, except upon the basis of an agreementof this sort. Indeed, so much have they been im-pressed with this view that they have carried out allnecessary moves upon the basis that such an agree-ment is in force.Under these circumstances I am directed by theExecutive Committee to ask you to obtain the assentof your Board to the above proposal without delayand to communicate their answer to me at the aboveaddress before 4.0 p.m. on Wednesday next the 12thinstant.I may add that it is obvious that many points ofdifficulty upon matters of detail under the aboveproposal may suggest themselves to the various com-panies, but in the opinion of the Executive Com-mittee these may safely be left to be dealt with sub-sequenily, and should not be allowed under presentcircumstances, to delay your company&apos;s notificationof its acceptance of the proposal.Yours faithfully,(Sgd.) H. A. Walker,Acting Chairman,Executive Committee.Secretary,..............................Railway3.This question of Arrears of Maintenance is ex-tremely complicated and largely technical in itsnature. It has to be noted that the Government hasbeen making payments on account of arrears of workwhich the companies have not yet overtaken and inrespect of which, therefore, they have not had anyoutgoings. The companies consequently are havingthe use of the money, the interest on which accruesto them &quot; below the lino.&quot; It is understood that oneof the reasons for making tho payments was that.thoy are in the nature of a quid pro quo to the com-panies in respect of the &quot; stitch&apos; in time &quot; principleof carrying out repairs.  This is an important point,* Page 4 of Printed Documents, Appendix I.B i
because obviously if tho &quot; stitch in time &quot; principlehas been commuted for payments on account, thequestion of arrears of maintenance is simplified con-sidorably. The &quot; standard &quot; of maintenance bywhich the &quot; arears &quot; are to bo ascertained is also avery important matter. So far as Maintenanceand Renewals of Way Works and Stations(Abstract A) and Maintenance and Renewalsof Rolling Stock (Abstract B) are concernedthe &quot;standard&quot; has been fixed as the totalamounts shown in these abstracts in the publishedaccounts of the companies for the year 1913. It isobvious that the &quot; arrears &quot; to be paid for are theai rears of work at tho end of the control period,because although a company may be in arrear now,part of those arrears may bo overtaken before thenext August, the balance being the arrears for whichthe Government will be liable. Consequently, it isimportant to note that a portion of the standardwork of maintenance is being carried out currentlyand the cost thereof charged against the Governmentthrough the &quot; Net Receipts &quot; Account. It has beentaken for granted that the cost of that portion ofthe &quot; standard &quot; work which has been carried outand charged against tho Government has cost morethan a similar portion of tho &quot; standard &quot; in 1913,as1 the result of various disturbing factors; conse-quently these disturbing factors must be eliminatedbefore a correct comparison can bo made with thocost in the &quot; standard &quot; year. Taking the lastformula) which have been issued to the railway corn-panics, viz., those for 1919, it will be found thatadjustments have to bo made in tho cost of the workdone and paid for by the Government through the&quot; Net Receipts &quot; Account in respect of tho tinder-noted disturbing factors before a comparison is madewith tlie cost of the &quot; standard &quot; work in 1913:-(1)(2)(3)Abstract A.Credits for supervisioncharged to the Govern-ment.Reduction in Mileageof Line open forTraffic.Expenditure on workfor Governmentcharged to Revenue-Abstract B.(I) Credits for supervisionand profit on Warmanufactures,(2) Rolling stock on loanto  War Departmentfor service overseas.(3) Reduction in RollingStock.(4) Expenditure on workfor Governmentcharged to Revenue-e.g., small works under 10 ; alterations toRolling Stock for theMilitary Authorities.(5) Expenditure on repairof Rolling Stock loanedby H.M..

Tho railway companies claim that suchexpenditure as that incurred in repairing damage totelegraphs by storms should be treated as abnormalwear and tear. Such expenditure is, of course,borne by tho Government through the net receiptsaccount,&apos; and if it is deducted from the commencingfigure in the arrears formula, the Government will betiablo for further arrears of work. This contentionof the companies has, however, been definitely re-fused, and the issue is therefore narrowed down toabnormal wear and tear duo te war conditions.Under this heading, only expenditure actually in-currcd in tho control period in making good abnormalwear and tear can bo deducted. Abnormal wear andtear not made good at tho end of control is to formthe subject of a separate claim. The railway com-panies will have some difficulty in establishing suchclaims, and each case of abnormal wear and tearsubmitted will have to be carefully scrutinised anddealt with on its merits, having regard to all thefactors alleged to have caused tho abnormal wearand tear. The onus of proof that such abnormal wearand tear has taken place should rest on the railwaycompanies.(ii) Allowance to reduce to 1913 cost. This is themost important of these adjustments, not onlybecause it affects all the other adjustments1 but chieflybecause it involves a largo sum of money. In theyear 1913 tho total expenditure of tho railway eom-panios in Great Britain under Abstracts A and Bwas over  25,000,000; the cost of the same work atpresent-day prices would be more than  75,000,000;consequently, a variation of even 1 per cent, inthe allowance for tho increased cost of labour andmaterials would make an appreciable difference inthe liability of the Government in respect of arrearsof maintenance. Owing to the technical nature ofthe subject and its inherent importance from thepoint of view of the Governments financial liability,it is necessary to deal at length and in considerabledetail with this question. As the conditions in con-nection with Abstracts A and B differ considerablyit is advisable to take each Abstract separately.Abstract A.The principal items making up the expenditurecharged against the various headings in the Abstractboth in the &quot; standard &quot; year and in the controlperiod are as follows: -Salaries...............Wages    ...............Materials used............Engine power supplied by locomotive,&amp;c, department    .........Other charges by locomotive, &amp;c,department   ............Charges by other departmentsWork done by contractors    ......Amounts in respect of property dis-placed credited to Capital AccountExpenditure on non-&quot; J &quot; joint linesand joint stations.........Sundry debits .........Gross debit......Less: Credits for materials recoveredSundry credits............Net cost of work done, being thecommencing figures of the arrearsformula       ............Add or deduct:Amount transferred to or fromDepreciation Fund or SuspenseAccount    ............Total of Abstract   ...... In order to calculate the allowance for the increased&apos;cost of labour and materials, two only of these itemsare taken as the basis for the calculation, viz:  Wages.Materials used.(The detailed instructions in regard to the calcula-tion are given in Clauses 15 to 20 of the Brown Bookand examples are worked out in  be first part of theHeliotrope Book.)
Tlie allowanco arrived at on the basis of these twoitems is applied to all the other items in the Abstract,with the oxception of tho &quot; Transfer to or from Dopre-ciation Fund or Suspense Account.&quot;This method is fundamentally wrong in principleand not only gives an erroneous result, but has un-doubtedly led to abuse, in the undernoted respects:  (a) The allowance does not give a correct resultbecause it leaves out the important elementof credits for recovered materials, i.e.,scrap, etc., and is applied to figures repre-senting items of a different nature andcomposition.(b) Items included in the accounts at pre-warcosts aro subject to a deduction for in-creased costs before comparison with the1913 standard.(c) The provision that not loss than 80 per cent.of each of tho three classes of materialsused on Abstract A work should be takenhas not been adhered to by all the railwaycompanies.(d) 80 per cent, (in value) of materials issued andused is not a fair loading if companies canchoose their materials and limit themselvesto 80 per cent.3(a)It will bo obsorved from the undernoted instructionsthat in arriving at the allowance for increased cost,the credits from materials recovered are not takeninto account:  Increased Prices of Materials.   Abstract &quot; A.&quot;18(a) In order to avoid the trouble of calcula-ting tho whole of the materials used in the controlperiod at prices for the year 1913 not less than80 per cent (in value) shall be so calculated.(b) In determining the minimum of 80 per cent,(in value) the gross debit for the materials issuedand used at the actual issue prices, i.e., beforetaking credit for the amount dealt with inrespect of scrap materials returned, should beadopted as the basis for the total value of thematerials mainly charged to Abstract A. Sofar as possible the materials selected should corre-spond with the materials selected in the case ofprevious Arrears Statements.(c) The actual quantities of the materials issuedand used mainly chargeable to Abstract &quot;A,&quot;selected to represent the 80 per cent, in the con-trol period under review, and the cost thereof atactual issue prices, to be tabulated in detail andcompared in the total with the cost for similarquantities at the issue prices for the year 1913,the net increase so ascertained to be expressed asa percentage of the former cost.The percentage increase so ascertained to beapplied to the cost of all materials used in thecontrol period under review and charged toAbstract A, after taking credit for the amountdealt with in respect of scrap materials returnedwhich will give &quot; tho cost at the prices for theyear 1913 of materials used in maintenance andrenewal work carried out in the control periodunder review,&quot; referred to in Clause 20 hereof.The effect of this instruction is that tho formulaallowance for increased cost deduced from the valueof materials issued and usod i.c., eliminating creditsfor scrap has to be applied to a net value i.e., afterdeduction of credits for scrap and if tho porcentagoof increase in the gross and net is different, the resultwill be mathematically incorrect. A departure fromthe correct procedure for arriving at a truo result in-evitably raises the question as to which party is bene-fiting by tho error. When the method was adoptedthe course of events was of necessity obscure, but thisat least would bo clear that on a rising market therailway companies would benefit, while on a fallingmarket they would lose. As events have turned out,there has been practically a continual rise in pricesduring tho whole period of control. This question ofcredits from materials recovered involves somo tochi-cal details both in connection with the work done andwith the cost of doing tho work. It will bo readilyapreeiated for example that, in the maintenance andrenewal of running lines and sidings which form onan average more than 50 per cent, of the total ox-penditure on Abstract A., for every rail, chair, sleeper,fishplate, bolt and spike, issued arid used, a corres-ponding rail, chair, sleeper, fishplate, bolt and spike,aro recovered. These recovered materials may bo re-usable by tho railway company or they may be of nouse except as scrap for selling purposes. As a rule,the railway companies deal with both these transac-tions through their Stock of Stores Account; Le.,thoy charge out tho materials used and take back tostock the materials recovered. Where that is done, thecost of materials issued and used is charged againstAbstract A at their book prices; in the caso of thevaluation of recovered materials, however, there aredifferent practices in vogue among the railway com-panies; tho principal methods being (a) to credit Ab-stract A with approximate market value, and (b) tocredit Abstract A with purely nominal values, an ad-justment being made in both cases when materials aresold and actual values realised. If re-usable materialsare credited to Abstract A at nominal values when re-covered, they are charged out at nominal values whenre-used, and a similar procedure is adopted when thevaluation of materials recovered is at approximatecurrent market prices. It will thus be seen that thematerials issued and used usually consist of:  New materials at purchase prices.Re-usable materials at nominal prices in the caseof some companies, and at approximate currentmarket prices in the case of others;while the materials recovered consist of :  Re-usable materials credited to Abstract A atnominal prices in the case of some companies, andat approximate current market prices in the caseof others.Scrap materials credited to Abstract A at nomi-na&apos;l or at approximate current market prices tobegin with, but a further adjustment is usuallymade in both cases in Abstract A of the differencebetween the stock price and the price realisedwhen the scrap is sold.The following example will show the net result ofthese different procedures:  Recoverable Materials valued at approximateCurrent Market Prices.At  18 per ton purchase price......   180Recoverable Materials valued atNominal Prices.10 tons new rails used, at  18 per tonpurchase price   ............ 180Less: 9 tons re-usable rails recovered, at 2 per ton nominal value    ......      18--- 1629 tons re-usable rails re-used at  2 ...     18hess: 8 tons scrap rails recovered at  2per ton nominal value.........      16At  11 per ton approximate marketprice       ...............      09_    81At  11 per ton    ............  99At  10 per ton approximate marketprice       ...............      80_      19 164  100Less: Credit from 8 tons scrap rails sold At  10 10s. actual selling price      ...    84at  10 10s. actual selling price   ...     84Deduct:  Book value already creditedat  2 per ton   ............       16 At  10 per ton   ............       80-      68 _       4Net result in both cases......   96   9(t
It is, of course, not contended that the sameresult will be obtained in actual practice from thesetwo methods of dealing with matorials recovered, buttho net results in both cases will be approximatelynear ono another. These differences in method,however, gave rise to complications in carrying outthe Arrears of Maintenance Instructions. Thosecompanies whose pre-war practice was to valuerecovered material at market prices continued theirpractice during the control period and creditedAbstract A with tho high prices then ruling. Whensecond-hand materials were used by these companieson Abstract A work such matorials wero charged outat the higher prices. Those companies, however,who dealt in nominal values had also to continuetheir pre-war practice as a result of which theirsecond-hand materials used on Abstract A work wascharged out at the same prices as in the standardyard, and if these materials at nominal prices wereincluded in the minimum of 80 per cent, referred toin the Arrears of Maintenance Instructions theirallowance for increased costs would bo considerablyroduced.It is also quite possible that during the Controlperiod, a piece of work might, so far as materialsare concerned, cost less through the operation of thehigh credits for recovered materials, than a similarpiece of work in tho standard year. Tho followingexample shows the approximate cost in matorials ofre-railing one mile of Running Line in the years1913 and 1918 with new rails weighing 90 lbs. peryard, tho recovered rails being of the same sectionwhen new:  Materials used in both Years:T.

Joint Lines and Joint Stations,&quot; &quot; SundryDebits &quot; and &quot; Sundry Credits,&quot; is equally open toobjection on principle.       ,3(6).Some companies havo not increased their charge forengine power by their locomotive department againsttheir engineers&apos; department beyond the pre-warfigure. This makes no difference in the &quot; NetReceipts &quot; Account, but the debit included inAbstract A is subject to adjustment for increasedcosts in tho arrears of maintenance claim, althoughthere is no increase in cost while the credit inAbstracts 131 and C is not? taken into account forarrears of maintenance purposes. Again, in the caseof many companies tho amount charged againstAbstract A in respect of property displaced &quot;is theoriginal cost of the property. This item also is sub-ject to adjustment for increased cost, althoughadmittedly it is a pre-war figure, and as the increasedcost of replacing the property is charged to capitalthe railway companies receive a further paymentunder the &quot; Interest on Capital Agreement.&quot; Theapplication of the allowance for increased cost oflabour and materials on the basis of the wages paidto tho railway companies&apos; own staff and the materialsusod from their own stocks to the cost of work doneby contractors is also open to objection. It has tobe remembered that a considerable portion of theengineering work charged to Abstract A in 1913 wascarried out by contractors, and the cost thereof istherefore included in the &quot;standard&quot; for thatAbstract. This work done by contractors is usuallycarried out by skilled and semi-skilled men. It isnotorious that the wages paid by the railway com-panies in 1913 to the large majority of the menengaged in Abstract A work, viz., platelayers andsurfacemen, were exceedingly low; consequently theincreases granted to these men during the war beara higher ratio to their pre-war wages than the corre-sponding increases granted by contractors to theirskilled and semi-skilled employees bear to the pre-warwages of these men; therefore in applying thepercentage of increased cost arrived at on the basisof the increased wages paid to their own staff and theincreased cost of their own stores in the years whenthe increased wages were included in Abstract A tothe cost of work done by contractors in these years,the railway companies would appear to be reducingthe work done by contractors below the cost of thecorresponding work in the standard year. A distinc-tion, however, has to be made here. In the years 1915and 1916 the increases granted to platelayers, surface-men and other &quot; Conciliation Grade &quot; men engagedon Abstract A work were not charged to Abstract A,but to a special heading in order that these increasesmight be apportioned between the Government and thecompanies in accordance with the arrangementrelating to the first war bonus granted to the menin the conciliation grades. The railway companieswere therefore adversely affected in these years, butit has to be remembered that the percentage of in-crease in 1915 and 1916 was relatively small. Takingthe whole control period and setting off the loss in1915 and 1916 against the gain from 1917 onwards,it is considered that the railway companies havebenefited under this arrangement, but in view of thedifficulty of arriving at a correct figure for the in-creased cost of contractors&apos; work over the cost of thecorresponding work in 1913, it is inadvisable to disturbthe arrangement so far as contractors&apos; accounts areconcerned, especially as the question of credits fromscrap recovered does not materially affect theseaccounts.
3 (c).The materials used in the repair and renewal ofway, works and stations are very different incharacter and aro subject to varying fluctuations intheir purchase prices. This seoms to have beenappreciated at tho time the &quot; Heliotrope&quot; Bookwas issued, because the intention is clearly expressedthore that the materials issued and used on AbstractA works were to bo divided into three groups andnot less than 80 per cent, in valuo of each groupwere to be calculated at 1913 prices.It may be that it was owing to tho complicationsarising from the differences in method of valuingrecovered material among tho various railway com-panies referred to on pages 11 and 12, that theRailway Executive Committee did not insist on alltho railway companies carrying out tho provisionin the Heliotrope Book that not less than 80 percent, of each class of materials should bo calculatedat 1913 prices, so long as not less than 80 per cent,of tho total were so calculated.3 (d).Tho original intention of limiting tho materials tobo calculated at 1913 pricos to 80 per cent, was tosave work.The instruction roads:  &quot; In order to avoid the trouble of calculatingthe whole of the materials used in the Controlperiod at prices for the year 1913, not less than80 per cent, (in value) shall be so calculated.&quot;Obviously, however, if the railway companies takeadvantage of this concession by choosing thematerials most favourable to themselves and limitingthe calculation to 80 per cent., this will not be afair loading. In this case also, it is understood theRailway Executive Committee have left the choosingof the materials to the individual railway com-panies, as a result of which tho original intentionof saving work became a subsidiary considerationif by taking out the full 100 per cent, a railwaycompany ascertained which materials from theirpoint of view would be the best to include in, andwhich materials should be eliminated from, the80 per cent, minimum.Abstract B.   (1) Locomotives; (2) Carriages;(3) Wagons.Abstract B is dealt with as a whole in arrivingat the net amount of Arrears (e.g., an excess inWagons is deducted from arrears in Locomotives, andCarriages), but separate calculations are made foreach section of the Abstract to arrive at the allow-ance for increased costs of labour and materials.The method of arriving at the allowance is thesame for all three sections and they can therefore betreated as one and the Abstract dealt with as a unit.The principal items making up the expenditurecharged against the various headings in the threesections of the abstract in the control period areas follows:   (1) Salaries    ............(2) Wages of men employed on therenewal and repair of rollingstock      ............(3) Materials used in the renewaland repair of rolling stock ...(4) Renewals and repairs to jointstock by other railway com-panies    ............(5) New rolling stock purchased...(6) Rolling stock repaired by con-tractors ............(7) Wages of men employed on therenewal and repair ofmachinery and plant; on clean-ing workshops; attending tomachinery and other workshopexpenses.........(8) Materials used in the renewaland repair of machinery andplant and for other workshopexpenses; supply of power, etc. (9) New plant, equipment and toolspurchased   for   replacementpurposes............(10) Sundry debits.........IjCss :(11) Credits for materials recovered(12) Sundry credits   ......Net cost of work done,being tho commencing figureof the arrears formulaAdd or Deduct:Amount transferred to orfrom debit or credit of deprc-ciation fund or suspenseaccount  ......      ......Total of Abstract    ...  In the year 1913 very few railway companies hadtheir rolling stock repaired by contractors, and, as arule, the large railway companies carried out all theirronewals in their own shops. To meet the alteredcircumstances in the control period, a special adjust-mont is allowed for rolling stock renewed or repairedby contractors, which, in ordinary circumstances,would have been built or repairod in thecompanies&apos; own shops. This is one oircum-stance different from those in connection withAbstract A. There are also comparatively fewmen in the Conciliation Grades employed on AbstractB work; consequently, the war bonus in 1915 and1916, charged to the Special Account, instead of toAbstract B, is comparatively trivial. As the bulk oftho men employed on Abstract B work are skilled andsemi-skilled men, the ratio of the war increasesgranted to them will approximate to the ratio of theincreases granted to the corresponding artisans, etc.,employed by contractors, although, owing to the factthat the wages to railway shopmen were below therelative district rates in 1913, the ratio of increasewill, it is considered, be higher in the case of the rail-way shopmen than in the case of contractors&apos; men.Taking everything into consideration, it is thoughtthat, after deducting the special allowance in respectof contractors&apos; profit and higher working expenses, andapplying the percentage for increased costs arrivedat on the basis of the wages paid to the railway shop-men and materials used in the companies&apos; shops onthe repair and renewal of rolling stock to the balance ofthe amount paid to contractors for renewals and re-pairs of rolling stock carried out by them, therailway companies are benefiting at the expense ofthe Government, although not to a very great extent.As in the case of Abstract A, only two of the itemscharged to Abstract B, quoted on page 13, are takenas the basis for the calculation of the allowance forthe increased cost of labour and materials, viz.:  Wages of men mainly employed on the renewaland repair of rolling stock:Materials mainly used in the renewal and repairof rolling stock.It is difficult to understand why the wages of menemployed on workshop expenses should have been leftout, because it would have simplified matters con-siderably for the clerical staff engaged on the calcu-lation, and would have given a more accurate result.There is also no obvious reason for leaving out of thecalculation the materials used in connection withworkshop expenses in arriving at the 80 per cent,minimum referred to in the instructions, while alltho remarks in regard to credits from materials re-covered in connection with Abstract A apply withequal force to the credits from materials recoveredin connection with Abstract B and need not berepeated here. The application of the allowance forincreased costs arrived at on the present basis to theitems of &quot; Salaries,&quot; &quot; Renewals and Repairs ofJoint Stock by other Railway Companies,&quot; &quot; SundryDebits &quot; and &quot; Sundry Credits &quot; is open to objection.The suggested remedy for (3), pages 11 to 13,quoted above, is to work out a correct &quot;co-efficient by taking all factors which are at presentomitted into consideration.
A rough approximation of the extra cost to thoGovernment if these alterations are not made is 14,000,000, arrived at as follows:-Tho total actual expenditure on Ab-stract A and B from 5Uh August,1914, to 31st December, 1919, isestimated by the Director-Generalof Finance and Statistics asThe estimated actual expenditurefor tho remaining period of con-trol from 1st January, 1920, to15th August, 1921, is as follows:-Year 1920 (same as 1919) ...Control period of 1921Total 169,800,00051,500,00028,700,000 250,000,000It has boon estimated that tho co-efficient  for each  control yearundor  tho  present   Arrears  ofMaintenance Instructions is over-stated by not less than 2 per cent.2 per cent of  250,000,000 ...Add to bring this amount upto the value current when thowork is executed, say  ......Total ...4.5,000,0009,000,000 14,000,000Total Expenditure by Hallway Consumes.There is no incentive to economy on the part of thorailway companies, because their 1913 not receiptsbeing guaranteed, any expenditure &quot; above the lino &quot;falls on tho Government; the latter has at the momentno efficient check on such expenditure. The im-portance of this will be realised when it is stated thaton an approximate rough estimate of the total ex-penditure of the railway companies for tho seven yearsof control, viz.,  1,200,000,000 even 5 per cent, gives 60,000,000.Stores Agreement.As the Ministry of Transport has, with the adviceof the Rates Advisory Committee, increased bothrates and fares with a view to meet the increasedexpenditure due to the economic conditions nowprevailing, including the increased cost of Stores,the railway companies do not appear to be entitledto receive from tho Government a payment whichwill put them in the position of having at the endof the control period the same quantity of stores onhand as they had at 4th August, 1914, at pre-warprices, especially as that will give them the additionaladvantage of being able to realise the high marketprices from the serviceable and scrap materials tobo recovered from their Way and Works when thelow-price materials are used on Maintenance andRenewal.The suggested remedy is that a new arrangementshould be made. The Stores arrangement wasentered into in 1916 to meet the circumstances thenruling; as these circumstances have completelychanged and tho railway companies have a quidpro quo the Government may fairly claim that they(the railway companies) should not be paid for theincrease in tho stores twice over.In any event tho railway companies aro notentitled to tho enhanced value of the credits fromrecovered materials corresponding to tho quantityof stores on hand at pre-war prices.If tho arrangement is revised as suggested abovetho saving to the Government is estimated bytho Director-General of Finance and Statistics at 20,000,000. The enhanced value of the recoveredmaterials over pre-war prices is estimated at 5,000,000, arrived at as follows:-Tho stock of stores on hand of tho14 principal railway companiesin Great Britain at 31stDecember, 1913, was    ......Tho corresponding stock of stores ofthe remaining railway corn-panics is estimated as one-ninthof that figure    .........Say  ...     ...Deduct cost of stores ou hand withno residual value such as coal,oil, etc., say 50 per cent.Leaving&apos; cost of stores on handwhich when used on Mainte-nanco and Ronewal Work willproduce serviceable and scrapmaterials .........It is estimated that the pre-warvalue of the recovered materialswould be .........And that tho value of similarmaterials at tho end of the con-trol period will bo      ......Being an enhanced value of13,376,0001,486,00014,862,00015,000,0007,500,0007,500,0002,500,0007,500,000 5,000,000If the stores arrangement is not revised, as sug-gested above, there are two further points to whichattention should be drawn :  . (1) Under present conditions, it would be profit-able to the railway companies to with-hold scrap from tho market until the endof the control period, and either give theGovernment credit at low book values ornot take such materials into their booksat all(2) The railway companies can purchase nowmaterials during tho control period andcharge them  against the  Government;but these materials may not necessarilybe used, and may be on hand at the endof  the   control   period,   although   notincluded in tho Book Stock.It seems desirable, in such an event, that stepsshould be taken to ensure a correct stock-taking of allmaterials on hand at the end of tho Control period,so that tho Government  may be satisfied that thebasis figure of the Claim undor the Stores arrange-ment is reasonably correct.
Statement of Evidence submiI was appointed in May, 1916, to act on belialf ofHis Majesty&apos;? Government as Consulting Accountantin relation to tho State Control of Railways, in suc-cession to my late senior partner Mr, J. GurneyFowler, who had been appointed to the office in Sep-tember, 1914, in conjunction with Sir WilliamPlender. With the permission of the Committee,I will defer my explanation of the duties attachedto my position until I come to speak of the meansnow being taken to safeguard the interests of theState in tho assessment of claims under the agree-ment with the railways.As I have indicated, my appointment dates froma period some time after the inception of control, andI have therefore no personal knowledge of the nego-tiations which resulted in the original agreement orthe circumstances concerning the issue of the originalMemorandum of Instructions, which has been treatedas an authoritative code of rules for the preparationof claims under the agreement. I find, however, thattho Memorandum, which was prepared by a committeeof the accountants of the principal railway companies,was submitted in draft to my predecessor, and it isevident from the correspondence and from notes hehas left that tho proposed rules were carefully con-sidered by him and discussed with, and approved by,the Board of Trade before they were finally issued.Subsequently as questions arose, or as amplifica-tions of the original instructions were needed as aconsequence of the prolongation of the war, supple-mental Memoranda of Instructions were compiled.These memoranda were submitted to me, and as arule to my colleague Sir William Plender before theywere issued with the approval of the Board of Tradeor of the Ministry of Transport.The particulars concerning the agreement for theassessment of compensation payable to the railwayspassing under State control are set forth in the col-lection of papers entitled &quot; Principal Letters andDocuments relating to the General Railway Agree-ments.&quot; I have had the opportunity of lookingthrough this collection of papers and know of nodocument which I think could bo usefully added asthrowing light on the subject of the general agree-ments between His Majesty&apos;s Government and therailway companies.The terms of compensation may be roughly sum-marised thus: The Government undertakes to makeup to the railway companies any deficiency in netrevenue on railway working (including auxiliarybusinesses) received by them per annum during con-trol as compared with their net revenue therefrom asset forth in the accounts they issued to their share-holders and filed with the Board of Trade for theyear 1913.The guarantee operates with regard only to therevenue grouped under certain specified heads in thestatutory form of accounts, viz.: the first seven itemsin Account No. 8, which may be roughly said to corn-prise the net receipts from railway working. It doesnot cover certain general classes of revenue such asrents and interest, and leaves untouched the divi-dends and interest payable upon the companies&apos;capital. It provides them with the same total ofnet receipts as appearing in their published accountsof 1913, and leaves each company to distribute theamount, together with any revenue from classes ofreceipts unaffected by the guarantee, in accordancewith the company&apos;s regulations.The standard taken was, as I have indicated, the netrevenue receipts under certain heads as shown by thepublished accounts of &quot; 1913.&quot; There has never beenany investigation into the accounts of that year withthe object of ascertaining that the net receipts soshown represented tho actual profit earned in 1913, asthe guarantee was apparently intended to ensure toeach eomivjiiv not necessarily the actual net profit of1913, but rather the particular figure of net revenueset out in the published account of that year.ed by Sir Albert Wyon,Each company is bound to prepare for each year ofcontrol an account of revenue receipts and expenses,and the difference between the net result of thisaccount and the published figure of net receipts of1913 represents the compensation payable by theGovernment.It should bo explained that owing to the cessationof the Clearing House divisions of traffic and of cor-tain charges between the companies, tho RevenueAccounts prepared during control do not necessarilyrepresent the net revenue derived from the workingof a particular undertaking.in one respect the right of a company to chargethe Government with expenses properly incurred onrevenue account under tho agreed heads is limited,viz.: in respect of renewals of Permanent Way andRolling Stock, which are limited (subject to certainagreed variations) to the quantum of 1913. Thereis no agreement with the British railways limitingthe charges for repairs as distinguished from renewals,and in this respect the arrangement with the Britishrailways differs from that entered into with the Irishrailways.The arrangements whereby the companies are per-mitted to charge the Government with Arrears ofMaintenance and with Interest on Capital Worksbrought into use since the beginning of the basisyear 1913 as set forth in the documents before theCommittee are incidental to and do not modify thebroad principle of the compensation agreement.Claims under these three heads, viz., Compensa-tion for Deficiency of Net Receipts, Arrears of Main-tenance, and Interest on Capital Expenditure, havebeen and are being currently dealt with, but there arcclaims which, though they will arise as a result ofthe principles of compensation agreed upon, cannotbo dealt with until the termination of control, suchas claims in respect of replacement of stores and forabnormal wear and tear, the result of special con-ditions of traffic during control not made good beforethe termination of control. There are also claimswhich have been deferred by agreement until the ter-mihation of control in respect of deferred maintenanceof assets other than those the maintenance of whichis charged in the Revenue Abstracts, entitled &quot; Main-tenance and Renewal of Way and Works,&quot; and&quot; Maintenance and Renewal of Rolling Stock,&quot; suchas canals, docks, harbours and steamboats.There has been no discussion yet with the com-panies as to the methods to be followed in formulatingand assessing such claims, with the exception of theclaims for replacement of stores, in respect of whichan agreement has been arrived at (Document No. 71).1 am not in a position to express? any useful opinionwith regard to the possible extent of the outstandingliabilities of the State under the agreements. Theamount of the claims under the guarantee of netreceipts will be affected on the one hand by the in-creased cost of working resulting from increased ratesof wages paid and increased cost of materials used,and on the other hand by the additional receiptswhich may be expected to result from the increasesin passenger fares and goods rates. The claims forArrears of Maintenance unexecuted at the close ofcontrol and for replacement of stores cannot be esti-mated until the close of control and until theprinciples on which the cost of executing such arrearsshall be assessed have been formulated and agreedI am also not able to express any opinion as to theamount of any claim that may be made for the costof making good abnormal wear and tear not madegood at the end of control, and indeed until theprinciples upon which claims under this head havebeen discussed and settled it does not seem possible toform any trustworthy forecast of the liability.I will now describe the system of audit andexamination of the claims made by the companiesunder tho compensation arrangements which has beenadopted with the object of safeguarding the interestsri the State.
The Railway Executive Committee was formed atthe outbreak of war and consisted of tho generalmanagers of twelve of the principal railway com-panies with the President of tho Board of Trade aschairman. This Committee appointed a Sub-Com-mittee of Accountants consisting of the chiefaccountants of tho companies represented on theExecutive Committee. This Sub-Committee wascharged with the duty of examining. and reportingupon claims made under tho Compensation Agree-ment.To enable thorn to discharge this duty theAccountants&apos; Sub-Committee apportioned the workof investigation among members of their body, theclaim of each company being referred in the firstinstance to a member unconnected with the claimantcompany.The companies&apos; claims are drawn up in a formprescribed by the Railway Executive Committee andapproved by the Board of Trade. They are signedon behalf of each company by tho chief accountant,and in tho case of the claims for guarantee of netreceipts (but not in the case of claims for arrears ofmaintenance and interest on capital expenditure)must be verified by certificate of the company&apos;s ownauditors in tho following prescribed form: &quot; We haveexamined the accounts attached, and compared themwith tho books and vouchers of the company. Wecertify that they aro correct, and that they have beenprepared strictly in accordance with tho Memorandumof Instructions issued by the Railway Executive Com-roittee with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Govorn-ment.&quot;The actual work of investigation of these claims isconducted by two members of the staff of thenominated accountant, who are known as theinvestigators, and consists of an examination of theaccounts submitted by the claimant company with thebooks and records of that company.The report of the investigators is compiled underthe supervision of the accountant from whose staffthey are drawn, and consists of replies to a numberol questions and the furnishing of specific informationaccording to a form prepared by the Accountants&apos;Sub-Committee. In addition the investigators areauthorised and required to include in their reportany relevant information which may not fall withinthe scope of the prescribed questions.These reports are signed by the investigatingaccountant and the two investigators, and remittedto the Accountants&apos; Sub-Committee with the accountprepared by the company setting forth its claim.The claims are examined by the Accountants&apos; Sub-Committee with the aid of the Investigators&apos; reports,and their decisions upon any questions raised in thosereports are recorded in their minutes. As the resultof these decisions a number of amendments have beenmade in the claims submitted. In the event of a com-pany declining to accept a decision of the Account-ants&apos; Sub-Committee a reference is made to the Com-pensation Accounts Sub-Committee, consisting of twomembers of the Railway Executive Committee (nowthe standing Committee of General Managers) andmembers of the Accountants&apos; Sub-Committee and thecompany is called upon to state its case. Thedecisions of this Sub-Committee are recorded byMinute.Eventually the claims together with theInvestigators&apos; reports and copies of the Minutes ofany decisions come to by the two Sub-Committeesreferred to are remitted to the ConsultingAccountant.The duties of the Consulting Accountant are setforth in the following letter from the Board of Tradeto the late Mr. Gurney Fowler:  7th December, 1.914.Sir,&quot;1 am directed by the Board of Trade to advert&quot; to the arrangement which, as announced in the&quot; Press, has been made by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-&quot; ment with the Railway Executive Committee&quot; for the payment of compensation during the&quot; period for which railways in Great Britain have&quot;been taken over by the State.&quot; That arrangement is, briefly, that the&quot; aggregate net receipts during the period of the&quot; railways concerned are to be compared with&quot; a similar aggregate for the corresponding period&quot; of the previous year and that the ascertained&quot; deficiency is to bo the amount of compensation&quot; duo, subject, however, to the following proviso,&quot; viz.: That, if the aggregate net receipts for the&quot; first half of the year 1914 are less than the&quot; aggregate net receipts for tho first half of the&quot; year 1913, the ascertained deficiency is to be&quot; reduced in a like proportion.&quot; The question, therefore, arises as to the scope&quot; of the examination to which tho accounts of the&quot; companies should be subjected on behalf of His&quot; Majesty&apos;s Government before payment is made.&quot; The accounts of all railway companies aro&quot; believed to be at present subject to a complete&quot; and detailed audit which is entirely independent&quot; of the management of the companies, and&quot; arangements will be made under which the state-&quot; ments on which the Exchequer payments are to&quot; be claimed will be examined and certified by&quot; these independent auditors.&quot; Having regard to the position and standing of&quot; tho companies and to this check, the Board aro of&quot; opinion that payment can properly be made upon&quot; such certificates subject to a general scrutiny on&quot; behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government of the&quot; character referred to below.&quot; The procedure which is contemplated is that&quot; in the first place the companies themselves should&quot; prepare drafts of certain Instructions and&quot; Schedules for the preparation of the Accounts&quot; on lines already indicated to them. When com-&quot; pleted these drafts will be submitted to the&quot; Government in order that they may be criticised&quot; and (if necessary) modified by the Board of&quot; Trade who will at this stage consult the expert&quot; selected to scrutinise the Accounts, and by the&quot; Treasury. The Instructions, etc., will then be&quot; finally settled and issued through the companies&quot; to their Accountants who will prepare the&quot; Accounts on the lines thus laid down. When&quot; this has been done, the Accounts will in due&quot; course be audited by the professional auditors of&quot; the companies, and they will then be submitted&quot; to the Board of Trade with a view to the final&quot; payment of compensation. (The question of&quot; interim payments on account is a separate matter&quot; which need not now be considered).&quot; Before being finally passed for payment the&quot; certified claims will be referred to a consulting&quot; accountant whose duty it will be to satisfy him-&quot; self that the principles laid down in the&quot; memorandum have been duly observed and&quot; generally to secure proper consideration of the&quot; methods adopted, more particularly in regard to&quot; such matters as depreciation and the allocation&quot; of charges between Revenue Account and Capital&quot; Account.&quot; The Board contemplate that the Consulting&quot; Accountant, while relying in the main on the&quot; certificates of the professional Auditors of the&quot; companies, and conducting detailed investiga-&quot; tions only if and when questions arise in course&quot; of his examination which may appear to make&quot; such investigation necessary, should be generally&quot; responsible for seeing that the claims are in&quot; order.&quot; It is proposed that the Consulting Accountant&quot; should receive an inclusive fee of five hundred&quot; guineas for such period not exceeding twelve&quot; months as the present arrangements may con-&quot; tinue. Such fee would cover all ordinary out-of-&quot; pocket expenses (which are not expected to be&quot; considerable) apart from &apos; those of special&quot; &apos; investigations on detailed audits, which if&quot; * required would be separately arranged for.&apos;&quot; The Board would be glad if you would accept&quot; the position of Consulting Accountant on these&quot;terms.&quot; As already indicated, it is not intended that&quot; you should conduct a complete re-examination of&quot; all the accounts, but it would be desirable that&quot;you should satisfy yourself prhnd facie that the&quot; instructions, etc., have been duly carried out, and
&quot; certain points such as the treatment of depre-&quot; ciation and maintenance, transfers to and from&quot; special funds, withdrawals of stock, and the&quot; allocation of charges for the month of August&quot; would require special attention. The&quot; correspondence between the Government and the&quot; companies giving further details would, of&quot; course, be placed at your disposal.&quot; Sir William Plender would be willing to act&quot; with you in regard to the accounts of the com-&quot; panies to which Messrs. Price, Waterhouso and&quot; Company act as Auditors.&quot;I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) W. F. Maiiwood.My examination of the claims has been based uponthe documents submitted to me, and has been con-ducted by correspondence and by interviews eitherwith the Accountants&apos; Sub-Committee or with thecompanies themselves (except in a few cases ofspecial difficulty, where I have through my repre-sentatives myself made an examination of the com-pany&apos;s records).A great variety and number of points havo beenbrought before me involving a very voluminous bodyof correspondence, and I have also occasionally foundit necessary to raise points not specifically referredto in the documents furnished to me.As the result of the investigations of the Account-ants&apos; Sub-Committoe and my own subsequent en-quiries the companies have in a number of casesbeen required to amend their claims.In the great majority of instances the companieshave eventually acquiesced in my decisions, in a fewcases a compromise (which in all cases of importancehas had the specific approval of the Board of Trade)has been effected, and there remain outstanding arelatively small number of disputed claims which maybe referred for settlement to the Railway and CanalCommissioners.My colleague and myself aro now considering, withthe Ministry of Transport, a number of questionswhich have arisen in connection with claims nowunder examination.Since the formation of the Ministry of Transportmembers of their accountancy staff have accompaniedthe investigators in their investigations and haveattended tho meetings of tho Accountants&apos; Sub-Committee.I havo formod a high opinion of the skill and im-partiality with which tho Accountants&apos; Sub-Com-mittee and tho Investigators have fulfilled the im-portant duties devolving upon them.Throughout the period of my appointment theComptroller and Auditor-General has exercised ageneral supervision over my audit of the companies&apos;claims.He has, by his representative, attended from timeto time at my office, and examined a number ofaccounts and the relative papers and correspondence.His representative has put questions with the viewof acquainting the Comptroller and Auditor-Generalwith the methods adopted for checking the companies&apos;claims, and has expressed himself as satisfied withthe information given to him.In these observations, which I submit for tho con-sidoration of the Committee, I have purposely avoidedany reference to details of the claims which have beenor may be made by the railway companies, undertheir agreements with the Government, as any prema-ture expression of opinion on my part might con-ceivably prejudice the amicable and equitable settle-ment of such claims.

Method of arriving at the net receipts (asdefined) for the half-year ended 31st December, 1913,to be as follows :   Take the figure of net receipts (as defined)for year 1913 as per printed accounts anddeduct therefrom the net receipts of J-Joint Lines, as per Account No. 10. Thiswill give the net recepits of the company(as defined) for the year 1913     ......Prom this must be deducted the net receipts(as defined) of half-year ended 30th June,1913, adjusted as under:   Deduct the amount of net receiptsof J Joint Lines, included inAccount No. 10   .........Add   the   amount   included   inrospect of charges for completerenewals of permanent way androlling   stock   and   provisionstherefor (Abstracts A, B (1), (2),and (3))   ............Deduct one-half of the amountshown in the printed accountsfor the year 1913 for completerenewals of permanent way androlling   stock   and   provisionstherefor (Abstracts A, B (1), (2)and (3))   ............

Having regard to the varying conditions of theholiday traffics of the companies, it is not practicableto devise a uniform method of dividing the totaltraffic receipts of the month of August, 1913,between the corresponding control and non-controlperiods. Each company therefore to make such divi-sion in the manner which will, in their opinion,fairly apportion the total traffic receipts of thatmonth to such periods, provided that 27/92nds ofthe amounts received for the conveyance of mailsand parcel post for the quarter ended 30thSeptember, 1913, be apportioned to the period 5thto 31st August.Transfers for Reserves.9. If transfers from impersonal accounts were madein 1913 for the purpose, for example, of increasingthe provisions or reserves for bad and doubtful debts,renewals, pensions and provident funds, and suchtransfers were taken from accounts in credit createdin earlier years and not required for the objects andpurposes for which they were created, such transfersshould not be allowed to affect the net receipts ofthe two years for comparative purposes.

507(3)22nd December, 1914.The Assistant Secretary(Railway Department),Board of Trade,7, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.Dear Sir,II. 13676.I am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instantenclosing two copies of the draft memorandum ofinstructions to railway companies for the preparationof their accounts, framed by the Railway ExecutiveCommittee.1 have carefully perused the same, and, so far asI can form an opinion at tho present stage, theinstructions seem to me to meet all the points whichare likely to arise.I judge from Clause 6 thereof that the Joint Linestherein referred to will be treated as separate un dor-takings.I would point out that in paragraph 13 it mightho read that the certificate has to be signed by oneof three persons, viz., the chief accountant, theauditors, or the professional accountants, whereas Tbelieve it is the intention that the certificate shouldho signed by the chief accountant and countersignedby the auditors or professional accountants of tho&apos; timpany.Yours faithfully,(Signed)  J.

F. with Marwood. o) Hoardof Trade, 51st December, 1914, and resultnoted, in margin.)Draft.railway compensation committee.State Control of Railways.comments upon Draft Memorandum of Instructionsto Railway Companies for the preparation of theaccounts to be presented by each controlled com-pany to arrive at the amount of compensationpayable by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Agreement with Railway Companies.The agreement is not quite clear in the followingrespect. It provides that if the aggregate net re-ceipts for the first half of the year 1914 are less thanthe aggregate net receipts for the first half of the year1913, the ascertained deficiency (being the amount bywhich the aggregate net receipts during the controlledperiod fall short of the aggregate net receipts duringthe corresponding period of the preceding year) shallbe reduced in the like proportion. There appears tobe some doubt as to the manner in which this reduc-tion is to be made.   Take tho following example:  Aggregate net receipts from 5th August to31st December, 1913, say.........Aggregate net receipts from 5th August to31st December, 1914, say.........Ascertained deficiency       ......      ...Nothing to1,000,000 hlffi-750,000250,000Aggregate not receipts January to June,1913   ............*   ......   1,000,000Aggregate net receipts January to Juno,1914   ............&apos;   ......     900,000Falling off^10 per cent..........     100,000On the strict reading of tho agreement the ascer-tained deficiency of  250,000 would be reduced inlike proportion to the falling off in respect of 1,000,000, i.e., 10 per cent., and the amount ofcompensation due would therefore be  250,000 less10 per cent. ^  225,000. On tho other hand, in equityit should be reasoned that if the net receipts fromJanuary to June, 1914, have shown a falling off of10 per cent, as compared&apos; with those from Januaryto June, 1913, the net receipts in the controlled periodfrom 5th August to 31st December, 1914, might alsohave been expected to show a reduction of 10 per cent.compared with the corresponding period of 1913.II, therefore, the aggregate net receipts from5th August to 31st December, 1913, are  1,000,000,I ho expected amount from 5th August to 31stDecember, 1914, would be.........    900,000The actual receipts for this latter periodbeing..................    750,000The compensation due would be    ......    150,000instead of the amount determined above on the pro-portion basis of  225,000, in other words, a strictinterpretation of the wording of the agreement, &quot; theascertained deficiency shall be reduced in the likeproportion,&quot; would give to the railroad companies inthe assumed case a sum of  75,000, or 50 per cent,in excess of what would appear to be just. To takenn extreme case, if the reduction shown by a com--parisou of the two January to June periods and thetwo August to December periods were exactly thesame proportion, say 20 per cent, in both cases, onthe first method the compensation due would be theactual deficiency less 20 per cent., while on the secondmethod there would be no compensation due at allfor the reason that the aggregate net receipts hadshown no falling off other than what might have beenexpected from a consideration of the results fromJanuary to June, 1914, as compared with the sameperiod in 1913.Bad Debts.It may quite well happen that debts arising out Agreed byof traffic originating in the control period, which at Raihvays,the end of that period when the accounts of the their ownGovernment are settled, may appear to be good, may suggestion,subsequently be found to be bad, while on the otherhand the memorandum provides that all bad debtsin respect of traffic originating prior to the controlperiod at whatever date the same may be found tobe bad, are to be borne by the companies, and nottreated as an expense of the control period. Thiscondition might operate somewhat unfairly as againstthe railroads unless they are allowed at the end ofthe control period to provide a general reserve uponthe debts incurred during the control period basedupon normal experience in the past. Even then,moreover, debts in respect of traffic originating duringthe control period might become bad after the controlperiod by reason of war conditions, to an extentgreater than the normal, and in such cases underthe provisions of the memorandum it would appearthat this loss must be borne by the companies.Expenditures for Renewal of Permanent Way andRolling Stock.The memorandum provides that &quot; the amountcharged for the renewal of permanent way and rollingstock is not to exceed the amount included in thecorresponding period of 1913, except under specialcircumstances as additions to the length of line open,additions to rolling stock in service or by an increasein the cost of renewal work carried out during the32046a 2
Agree, butdoubt I ul ifperiod resulting from increased price of labour andmaterials.&quot;One of the most important factors in the determina-tion of the proper charges for renewals is the amountof use to which the permanent way and rolling stockhas been subjected, the usual measure of such usebeing engine or train miles or both. In determining,therefore, the proper charge to he made in theaccounts, it would seem that the number of trainmiles in the control period, as compared with thecorresponding period in the preceding year, should hetrain mileage taken into account as one of the factors which might1 &apos; justify an increase in the amount of such charges, ormight require a decrease if the train mileage shouldhappen to have been reduced. If the train mileageduring the control period should have been verymaterially increased there can he no doubt thatincreased renewal charges in respect of this periodmust eventually be necessary, even if such chargeshave not been incurred during that period, and insuch a case it would seem in justice to the railroadsthat they should be permitted to make reserves forthe deferred cost of maintenance appertaining to thelarger traffic carried.Provisions for Estimated Expenditure Liabilities.The same considerations as have been noted as beingapplicable to the charges for renewals would alsoapply to the provision of reserves for depreciation ormaintenance. The memorandum provides that inpreparing the accounts for the control period, &quot; eachcompany must follow strictly the method which regu-As above. lated the preparation of the accounts in 1913, andprovisions to be made should be proportionate to thesums necessary for the half-year ended 31st December,1913.&quot; If as a result of the greater use of the rail-roads by the Government the train mileage duringthe control period has considerably increased, itwould seem fair and reasonable that increased ratherthan proportionate sums should be allowed fordepreciation, etc.Stores Stocks.The memorandum provides that &quot; the measure ofwithdrawals from stores in advance of actual useshould he equal at the beginning and end of thecontrol period. It is difficult to understand themeaning of these words. In our railroad experienceWriting  stores which have not been actually used remain, soPlender who far as the accounts are concerned, in stores stocks,put this in. and no charge to traffic expenses is made until thestores have actually been used. Some railroads, how-ever, have a practice of ascertaining the quantitiesof their stores stocks at a date preceding the close ofthe half year, say November 30th, and in some sucheases it is customary to estimate the amount of thecharge to be made to traffic expenses for stores usedduring the month of December, the actual charges notcoming forward until after the accounts for the halfyear have been completed. It may be that it is tothis condition that the words quoted in the beginningof this paragraph referred. In any case it wouldseem desirable that its meaning should be more clearlydefined.Net Receipts for half-year ended December 31st, 1913.Under this heading the Memorandum provides amethod for arriving at the net receipts for the half-year ended December 31st, 1913, and after deductingthe amount of net receipts of J Hues included inaccount No. 10, provides for the addition of &quot; theamount included in respect of charges for completerenewals of permanent way and rolling stock andprovisions therefor (Abstracts A, B 1, 2, and 3.)&quot;Writing-    The wording  of this  paragraph is not sufficientlyChairman to precise. Abstract A, to which reference is made, con-define more    tains no account heading of &quot; Complete Renewals ofdefinitely.     Permanent Way,&quot; but it does contain a main head-ing of &quot; Maintenance of Permanent Way &quot; with twosub-headings entitled &quot; Renewal of Running Lines &quot;and &quot; Renair of Running Lines and Sidings.&quot;   Thepresumption   is  that it is the item &quot; Renewal ofRunning Lines &quot; which is to be added to the netreceipts of the hnlf-yenr, and one-half of which forthe   whole   year   is   to   be   deducted   therefrom.Abstracts B 1, 2 and 3 contain headings for &quot; Com-pleto Renewals &quot; for locomotives, carriages andwagons respectively, and presumably it is these itemsto which reference is mado in this case. The wordingof this paragraph should be altered so that it mayspecify with greater clearness exactly which itemsare referred to; the paragraph as it stands at presentis certainly open to the construction that the wholeof the expenditures contained in the Abstracts A andB 1, 2 and 3 are intended.Provision of Gross Railway Traffic Receipts forAugust, 1913.Under this heading the Memorandum providesinter alia &quot; that %\ of the amounts received for theconveyance of mails and parcels post for the quarterended 30th September, 1913, be apportioned to thoperiod 5th to 31st August.&quot; On pago 2 of theMemorandum, in dealing with mails, it is providedthat the sums received for tho conveyance of mailsfor the quarter ended 30th September, 1914, be appor-tioned between the two periods, viz., (1) 1st Julyto 4th August, (2) 5th August to 30th September,on the basis of the number of days in each, viz., 35and 57 respectively. The provisions with regard to1913 deal with an apportionment for the month ofAugust only, but do not state how the amount forthe month of September is to be arrived at. Pre-sumably this is to be arrived at on the same basis,viz., of the amounts received for the quarterended 30th September. It is submitted, however,that this should preferably be stated in theMemorandum.Net Receipts for half-year ended June 30t/i, 1914.Clause 10 of the Memorandum contains the words&quot; to be adjusted hy adding thereto the amountscharged in respect of renewals of permanent wayand rolling stock for that period and deducting there-from tho half of the total charges under those headsfor the year 1914.&quot; The wording in this case differsnot only from that contained in the form of annualaccounts, but also that used in an exactly similarconnection in respect of the net receipts for the half-year ended December 31st, 1913, to which referencehas already been made. The wording in the twoClauses should be identical and should be clearlyexpressed so as to define exactly the heading of th?account to which reference is made.Board of Trade,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,5th January, 1915.Dear Mr. Fowler,Referring to our conversation on the 31st ultimowith regard to Section &quot; D &quot; of the 4th paragraphof the Instructions as to Railway Companies&apos;Accounts, I enclose a copy of a letter from SirWilliam Plender which I think answers the pointyou raised.Yours faithfully,(Sd.)

Capital Expenditure.When the agreement was entered into it wasanticipated that the control would only last for ashort period, and it was not thought necessary tomake any provision with respect to capital expetidi-turc.   In consequence of the prolongation of thecontrol, this is causing a hardship to many companies,ior while tho Government is getting the benefit ofexpenditure which yielded no return in 1913, thecompanies have to pay interest or dividend upon thecapital raised and are receiving no revenue where-with to meet these payments.    Theoretically therevenue or saving derived from such expenditureought to be excluded from the calculation of netrevenue, on the principle that what is not in theaccounts of the base year (1913) should not be broughtinto the accounts for the control period (1915).  This,however, is not practicable, and the suggestion ofthe Executive Committee is that, upon all capitalexpended upon additional lines, works, rolling stock,etc., which have been brought into use since 31s.tDecember, 1912, or shall hereafter during control bebrought into use, the companies shall be allowed in-terest at an agreed rate from the commencement ofthe control period or from the date at which the worksor  plant  wore  brought  into  use,   as  the   casemay be.  Works of exceptional magnitude, especiallywhere  tho  expenditure  dates  back  a  long wayor yields a return very slowly, may require .to bespecially considered, but it is submitted that themajority of cases may be properly dealt with on thelines suggested.  At any rate, if the principle isadmitted namely, that a company is entitled to anallowance for capital expenditure which has becomeproductive since the &quot; corresponding period &quot; (i.e.,the period in 1913 with which tho accounts of thecontrol period are compared) it is thought that theaccountants will be able without serious difficulty todraw up simple rules which will be applicable tothe great majority of cases.* I understand that this memorandum was pre-pared by Sir Alexander Butterworth and sent to SirJ. Bradbury, who handed it, or a copy of it, to Mr.Gurney Fowler-E.T.2, Stores.A question has arisen with regard to what theposition of the companies will be at the end of thecontrol with regard to their stores. In the accountspresented to the Government the companies havegiven tho Government the benefit of the stocks boughtby them before the war or at pre-war prices,believing this to be in accordance with the view ofthe Government advisers. It is submitted that atthe end of the control period hardship will ensueunless the point is safeguarded, for the companiesrun the risk of finding themselves burdened withstocks of materials, etc., purchased during thecontrol period at inflated Avar prices. There is somedifference of opinion as to the effect of the agree-ment as it stands, but it is submitted that in thecircumstances the fair thing is that the companiesshould find themselves at the end of the control inthe same position as they were at the beginning inregard to both quantity and price in other words,that they should be treated as if during the controlperiod they were working the railways for theGovernment at Government cost, and were buying onbehalf of the Government at current prices allstores required for that purpose.It is suggested that the simplest Avay of givingeffect to this would be for the Government at theend of the control period to make a cash paymentequal to the difference between the cost of the storesand materials in stock at 5th August, 1914, and thecost of similar quantities of stores and materials atthe end of the control period, such payment beingbased upon the stock prices at the beginning of theperiod and the market prices at tho end. If thiswere done, the companies would be left in the sameposition financially as if they had warehoused alltheir stores when tbe control began and kept themin warehouse until the control was over, buying allnecessary materials on Government account in theinterval.In this connection it should be remembered that,iu some instances-notably timber the Governmentaro not only having the advantage of tho companies&apos;pre-war contracts, but aro benefiting by the .factthat the stocks of tho companies were, to a largeextent already seasoned, and, therefore, worth con-siderably more than the sum paid for them. Suchcases would probably require special consideration.Coal also might require to be dealt with speciallyin those cases where stores have been left in stockthroughout the war.
It is submitted that, whatever might be thought1.0 be the most suitable arrangement il the mainagreement were to be construed in the way contendedlor by the railway companies, the arrangement abovesuggested is the only fair one if the agreement -to be construed in a way that for practical purposesdeprives the companies of the surplus receipts whichmight otherwise accrue to them.3. The Proviso.The &quot; proviso rebate &quot; (as it has been called) wasimposed upon the companies by the Government onthe ground that, as the net receipts of tho aggre-gated companies were less for the first half of theyear 1914 than for the first half of the year 1913, itis reasonable to assume that, in tho absence of thoGovernment control, the net receipts for tho periodof the war would be less than for the correspondingperiod of the year 1913. It is not too much to saythat this reduction in the amount of compensationwould have been strenuously resisted by the com-panies had there been any anticipation of theenormous amount of work they have been calledupon to perform in connection with both &quot; com-mercial &quot; and &quot; military &quot; traffic. It may be fairlyassumed, indeed, that, had the Government had anysuch anticipation, the &quot; proviso &quot; would not havebeen suggested by them when considering the termsof the agreement. If this be so, it does not appearto bo unreasonable to ask for its cancellation whendiscussing with the Government the interpretationto be placed upon the agreement in the matter ofsurplus net receipts during the period of control.4. Inclusion of 100 per cent, of War Bonus inWorking Expenses. .So far as the railway companies are aware, noattempt has ever been made to justify on any logicalgrounds the exclusion from working expenses of 25per cent, of the war bonus paid to certain grades ofrailwaymen. It was urged upon them at the timethat strong grounds of expediency then existed forthat course, but presumably those have now ceasedto exist, and in any review of the agreement theinclusion of the whole of the first war bonus inworking expenses seems a mere act of justice, whilea discrimination between the first and the second warbonus seems as difficult to justify as a discriminationbetween different grades of railwaymen.If it be urged that the companies received a quidpro quo by the withdrawal of the proviso, the Exe-cutive Committee would refer to what has been saidabove with reference to the proviso; if there was infact no real justification for the insertion of theproviso in the first instance (although at the timeboth parties may have honestly thought otherwise),its withdrawal cannot be said to have constituted aquid pro quo, when the companies agreed, understrong pressure, to bear 25 per cent, of the war bonuspaid to certain grades of their employees.5. Charges for Renewal of Permanent Way andBoiling Stock.The present regulations as to renewals are thoughtto press hardly on certain companies, especially onwhat are called &quot; non-programme companies,&quot; i.e.,companies which do not work on any fixed pro-gramme in providing for renewals of permanent wayor rolling stock, but whose practice it is to chargeto working expenses either the actual amount ex-pended upon such renewals, or an indefinite sumaccording to circumstances.As the regulations stand to-day, they provide (sub-ject to the arrangement with regard to arrears ofmaintenance) that, if such a company spends moreon renewals in the control period than it spent onthe corresponding item in 1913, the excess is to bedisallowed, whereas, if it spends less, its chargeagainst the Government is limited to its actualexpenditure.   On the face of it this seems a one-sidedarrangement, and it is suggested that in such casesthe company might fairly be allowed to charge asmuch as was included in the accounts of 1913, irre-spectivo of actual expenditure, after making allow-ance, as in other cases, for increased rates of wagesand prices of materials.A further point arises, in the case of both&quot; non-programme companies &quot; and of certain &quot; pro-gramme companies,&quot; which calls for consideration,viz.: how far it is open to a company to include acharge in its accounts for renewals in respect of:idditions to rolling stock or mileage of lino. Thepresent Regulations, though it is believed that sucha charge was always contemplated, are not entirelyclear on the point, but it is submitted that it shouldbo open to all companies, &quot; programme &quot; or &quot; non-programme,&quot; to make such a charge that is to say,to increaso tho amount which it would otherwise beopen to them to charge for renewals by a sumrepresenting tho addition to rolling stock orpermanent way, as the case may be. The mode ofcalculating such sum, so as to insure its being fairlyproportionate to the additional plant, is a matterwhich, it is suggested, might be left to the technicaladvisers on each side.6. Allowances to Dependants.At the beginning of the war it was agreed withthe Board of Trade that, as the companies were notpaying the salaries or wages of men who enlisted,they should be at liberty to supplement the separa-tion allowances paid to their families, and chargethe amount of such supplement in their workingexpenses up to a limit of 10s. per week in each case.The companies are accordingly paying to the familiesand dependants of such of their men as have enlistedsums sufficient to bring their separation allowancesup to four-fifths of each man&apos;s salary or wage. Inview of what is being done for the families of menin Government Departments who enlist, and in viewof the fact that the railway companies are includingin their account against the. Government no partof the salaries or wages of unmarried men withoutdependants, it is submitted that there is no sufficientground for the limit of 10s., and that the companiesshould be allowed to include the whole of the supple-ment paid by them in their working expenses, up tofour-fifths of salary or wage.In the foregoing remarks no attempt has beenmade to deal with the various proposals in detail.The object of the present memorandum is to enume-rate the principal points which are thought to callfor consideration, and to indicate briefly the justi-fication for the proposals. If these proposals areagreed to in principle, it will not be a difficult matterfor the expert advisers on each side to draft a shortcode of subsidiary regulations giving effect to them.There are one or two other matters to which,perhaps, it may be as well to refer here, so that theymay not be lost sight of. One is the percentageaddition to be allowed in respect of arrears of niaiii-tenance of rolling stock and permanent way for theyear 1916. It has been agreed that 12  per cent,shall be allowed up to 31st December, 1915, but sincethat arrangement was come to prices have advancedvery materially. Another is the question of arrearsof maintenance of steamboats which have not beencommandeered by the Admiralty or War Office. Itdoes not seem possible to devise any formula for cal-culating these arrears, currently, as in the case ofrolling stock and permanent way, and the only wayof dealing with tho matter appears to bo to note thefact that there will be claims under this head, andthat they will be treated as being in principle iden-tical with the other claims for arrears of mainte-nance, leaving the amounts to be settled at the con-clusion of the period of control. A third point thatcalls for attention is the fact that 1916 is Leap Year;the companies consider that they are entitled to aproportionate addition to the net receipts in respectof the additional day.32046Ci
(2)London, E.C.24th February, 1916.Sir John Bradbury, K.C.B.,The Treasury,Whitehall, S.W.Dear Sir John Bkawsuby,State Contbol of Railways.We have carefully read the Memorandum ol&quot; Points arising upon the agreement between Con-trolled Railway Companies and the Government &quot;and have given particular consideration to the follow-ing matters;  (a) Allowance for capital expended on additionallines, works, rolling stock, etc., which havebeen brought into use during or subsequentto the year 1913.(b) The treatment of stocks of stores and materialat the end of the control period.(a) Allowance for Capital Expenditure.The views of the Railway Executive appear to bereasonable that consideration should be given to thosecompanies which have introduced into their systemadditional capital assets during or subsequent to theyear 1913.The principle can hardly be controverted that ifit were possible to ascertain the additional revenueor reduced working oxpenses affecting the net re-ceipts of the control period, arising from the intro-duction of new assets, the amount should beeliminated from the net receipts of such period toensure a true comparison with those of the basicperiod. As the ascertainment, however, of suchadditional earnings or savings is not possible, thefair alternative appears to be that interest shouldbe allowed at an agreed rate on expenditure charge-able to capital in respect of lines, works, rollingstock, etc., as and when brought into use.Rate of Interest on Capital Expenditure.Sir Alexander Butterworth, in his letter to SirThomas Heath, of the 13th ultimo, suggested a rateof 5 per cent, as being reasonable. In our view,however, the rate of 4 per cent, would be a fairerone to adopt and the members of the Finance Sub-Committee of the Railway Executive intimated afterdiscussion that they would be prepared to agree tothis rate being fixed for the period to 31st December,1915.(b) Treatment of Stocks and Stores and Material atthe end of the Control Period.The suggestion of the Railway Executive Com-mittee that the companies should not be prejudicedthrough giving the Government the benefit of theirstock of materials, stores, etc., bought at pre-warprices, does not appear to be unreasonable and, inour opinion, the difference between the book valueof stocks of stores and material at the beginning ofthe control period and the book value of stores of asimilar quantity and description at the end of thecontrol period should be allowed for. From this itfollows that, if any of tho stocks held at the end ofthe control period are in excess of the quantities atthe beginning, such excess should not be allowed for.It has been suggested that special considerationshould be paid to timber, but we think that once thebroad principle of allowing to the companies thedifference on book values is conceded, the subsidiaryquestion of timber and enhanced value should not beraised. The Railway Executive seemed to share thisview when the matter was discussed.We have refrained from making any attempt todefine with exactitude the methods of arriving at thecapital expenditure upon which interest should beallowed or of dealing with the stores in any detail.If the principles are agreed to, the details may wellbe left.to the Executive and to ourselves to settle, ifyou are agreeable.Though our views were not specifically invited onother questions referred to in the Memorandumdrawn up by the Exocutivo, we venture to submitthem in case they should be of use to you.(1) The &quot; Proviso.&quot;it is not clear that tho assumption underlying theimposition of the &quot; Proviso deduction &quot; can be heldto apply if succeeding years show such an improvo-ment in working results as to suggest that the waveof depression in the first half of 1914 had been stayed.This is said to be the fact. If, therefore; the &quot; Pro-viso deduction &quot; was waived in 1915 on the groundsof being no longer warranted by the circumstancesof 1915, then tho claim of the Railway Executive,that its withdrawal was not a &quot; quid pro quo &quot; totheir assuming tho burden of 25 per cent, on tho warbonus, would appear to be justified.(2) War Bonus.It would seem that, apart from any question ofgeneral policy, tho companies should bo allowed tocharge the whole amount of the bonus as a workingexpense. If the companies had been operating therailways for their own benefit, any additional wagespaid would have had to be borne as a working ex-pense, but in ordinary times the railways would haveresisted as unwarrantable such demands as that fortho payment of the war bonus. It may not be un-reasonable to suggest, therefore, that tho companiesin paying those highor wages, as they were directedto do, have only dono what was essential to the con-tinuous working of the railways under exceptionaleconomic conditions and have been acting as agentsfor the Government.(3) Charges for Renewal of Permanent Way andRolling Stock.As the principle has been recognised by the Gov-ernment that the railway companies should boallowed to charge arrears of maintenance, it wouldappear to us to cover the suggestion in the memo-randum that &quot; non-programme &quot; companies shouldbe allowed to charge as renewal expenditure ae largea sum as they included in thoir accounts for 1913.With regard to the further point, that companiesshould be allowed to charge in their accounts forrenewals in respect of additions to rolling stock orincreased mileage of line, our view is that such acharge is proper and in accordance with the spirit ofClause 4 of the original memorandum of instructions.It would seem to be desirable, however, that thepoint should be agreed, apart from the arrears ofmaintenance arrangement, in order that both &quot; pro-gramme &quot; and &quot; non-programme &quot; companies maybe treated on identical lines in the matter ofrenewals.(4) Allowance to Dependants.The claim that the companies shall be permitted tocharge the full allowances made by them to familiesand dependants of men who have enlisted, in orderto bring the separation allowance up to four-fifthsof each man&apos;s salary or wage, appears to bo one uponwhich arguments could be fairly advanced on bothsides. It is a question, perhaps, rather of policythan of principle. It may be said on the one handthat the Government has already assumed a sufficientburden in regard to these men; but on the otherhand, it may fairly be conceded that tho grantingby the railway companies of so large a proportion ofthe existing wage had a material bearing upon thesatisfactory response of railwaymen to the appeal forrecruits, and, therefore, the full amount should beallowed as a charge against the Government. Hadthe railways not been taken over by the State butoperated by the companies, this additional chargewould have been borne by revenuo as an ordinaryworking expense, and, on that ground, it may reason-ably be said that it should stand as a workingexponso during the period when the railways areoperated under the direction of the State.(5) Percentage addition to Claim, for Arrears ofMaintenance for the year 1916.If the average prices paid for similar services andmaterials in the year 1916 are greater than those for1915 when 12J per cent, was allowed, it would appear
to bo equitable to allow an increased average per-eontago based upon any further ascertained differencein prices.(6) Steamboats.We concur in the suggestion, that any claim forarrears of maintenance in regard to steamboats shouldhe left for consideration when the full circumstancescan bo roviowed in their proper perspective.(7) Additional day in 1916.Tho proposal that the net receipts for the year1916 should bo rebated by 1/366th part thereof soas to obtain a true comparison with the net receiptsof 1913 has, after discussion with the Executive, beenabandoned by them.We are informed that the principle of creditingto railway revenue all percentages added for &quot; profit &quot;and establishment charges in respect of work per-formod for Government Departments, armamentfirms, etc., has been clearly laid down and, as faras is known to the Executive, has been followed.We are,Yours faithfully,(Signed)     J. Gurney Fowler.W. Plunder.(3)31st May, 1916.Sir John Bradbury, K.O.E.,Tho Treasury,S.W.Dear Sir John Bradbury,State Control oi? Railways.Interest on Capital Expenditure.Sir William Plender has sent on to me a copy ofyour letter to him of the 26th inst. and of the letterfrom Sir A. Kaye Butterworth to Sir Thomas Heathwhich accompanied it.1 understand that the suggestion mado is, that thecompanies shall receive interest upon expenditure onnew capital works at the rate of 4 per cent, perannum from the several dates at which those worksare first brought into productive use. In my view,the suggestion is one which might well meet withacceptance, and I see no objection to the proposalthat the rate of interest to be allowed shall be fixedat 4 per cent, for the period of control.Yours very truly,(Signed) Albert W. Wyon.(4)Treasury, S.W.26th June, 1916.Dear Mr. Wyon,With reference (1) to the report by Sir WilliamPlender and Mr. Gurney Fowler dated 24th February,1916, on the memorandum submitted by the RailwayExecutive Committee of points arising upon theagreement between the controlled railway companiesand the Government, and (2) to your letter of 31st, May recommending the acceptance of a latersuggestion by Sir Alexander Butterworth that ,therate of interest on new capital expenditure on worksshould be fixed at 4 per cent, not only for the periodto 31st December, 1915, but for the whole period ofcontrol, I have now to acquaint you that furtherinterviews have since taken place between theTreasury and Sir A. Butterworth, with the resultthat the latter has submitted for approval, assuggested, formal steps for agreeing upon now clausesto interpret and amplify the original agreement (1)a draft of a letter which might be written to theRailway Executive Committee by tho President ofthe Board of Trade on behalf of tho Government,(2) a draft of a letter which might be sent out bythe Railway Executive Committee to the railwaycompanies inviting them to come into the settlement.I send copies of these documents herewith, and Iwrite, ou behalf of tho Treasury, to ask you to be sokind as to consider them and report whether thedrafts arc such as the Treasury might properlyagree to.I should add a few further explanations withreference-to au interview which I had with Sir A.^Butterworth on Friday last.Some of tho things mentioned in our conversationare set out in another letter from Sir A. Butterworthto me of the 23rd instant, of which I also enclose acopy. With regard to the paragraphs of this latterletter, 1 may explain as follows:  5. This relates to paragraph 5 in the draft letterto the Railway Executive Committee. The clauso isat present left olank pending farther discussionbetween the Government Departments concerned andthe officers of the Railway Executive Committee, theobject of which is to agree on a clause defining exactlythe cases in which goods and passenger traffic is tobe paid for, and those in which it is to go free andbe charged through tile deficiency. I think, there-fore, you need not trouble about this clauso atpresent.With regard to Sir A. Butterworth&apos;s last para-graph, I should explain that the &quot; rents &quot; questionrelates to rents for storage accommodation providedby the companies for the War Department-a ques-tion which does not come into our present discussion.The question of the rates of Income Tax to be de-ducted from interest on capital payable by HisMajesty&apos;s Government must, I presume, bo decidedby the Inland Revenue Authorities, but on the meritsit would seein that the view expressed by Sir A.Butterworth is the equitable one.I now come to the observations which I have tomake on the draft letter to the Railway ExecutiveCommittee.Clause 1. Capital Expenditure.The words &quot; and also the Hand used in connectionwith works &quot; in the bracket are new. So also is thewhole of &quot; (2) mineral support acquired ... in factbeen so charged&quot; and the references to &quot;mineralsupport &quot; later on in the clause. We should be gladof your views on the propriety of these additions.As regards the period for which 4 per cent, was tobe fixed as the rate of interest payable by the Govern-ment on the new capital spent on works, you willremember that Sir A. Butterworth himself suggested,that it should be the whole period of control. Itappears, however, that the Committee were dividecjas to the acceptance or non-acceptance of this period,and consequently the original proposal was replaced.I am disposed to think we ought to insist on the 4per cent, being now fixed for the whole period assuming that you do not think that we could havegot the rate down below 4 per cent, for the periodafter 31st December, 1915? But we should be gladof your advice. Sir A. Butterworth thought that,if we insisted on the 4 per cent, being fixed for thewhole period, it would &quot; sweeten &quot; the decision tpthe companies if in the last sentence of the clausethe Government would put in &quot; 90 per cent &quot; after&quot; forthwith &quot; and substitute &quot; 30th June, 1916,&quot; for&quot; 31st December, 1915.&quot; I am not sure that this isnecessary. In any case I think we must stipulatethat the 90 per cent, of the total interest to 31stDecember, 1915, or 30th June, 1916, is to be paid,not in one lump, but in three or four monthly instaj-ment8. *Clause 2.Paragraph 2 &quot; Where at tho end of the Governmentcontrol . . . materials to the company &quot; is new,and I felt doubts about it. Sir A. Butterworth saidit was only to meet the case of one company (appar-ently the South-Eastern) who had been ordorod bythe War Office to lay in a stock of coal largely inexcess of anything they were accustomed to keep.He suggested that you should discuss the matter withthe general manager or the accountant of the com-pany.We should be much obliged for your advice as tothe propriety of tho whole clause, and of this para-graph in particular.
Clause 3. Allowances to dependants.I noticed from some former papers thai the allow-anco in the case of non-commissioned officers andmen was limited to such an amount as would make upthe total receipts to not more than four-fifths ofsalary or wages, and I think we must have these&quot;words put in. I have not yet received copies of thecircular letters Nos. 274, 277, 288 or 321 referred to,and therefore do not know what the payments tocommissioned officers are.Clause 4 seems all right, but, as regards Clause 6,1 would call attention to Sir A. Butterworth&apos;s letter(paragraph 6). No doubt the companies ought topay intorest in those cases; but I do not know atwhat rate (if any) Government now pays interest tothe companies in cases where there is delay in pay-ment for work done at cost price.   Do you know?In tho draft letter from tho Railway ExecutiveCommittee to the companies I propose to make analteration in one passage, as marked in rod ink.Yours very truly,(Signed)  T. L. Heath.1\S. I have written in tho same terms to SirWilliam Plender.T.L.H.(5)Enclosure No. 1 to Document 4.Draft Letter from the President of the Board ofTrade to the Acting Chairman of the RailwayExecutive Committee.Sir,With reference to Mr. Marwood&apos;s letter to your-self of the 12th October, 1914, and subsequent corre-spondence on the subject of the agreement as to thecompensation to be paid by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto the railway companies under the Regulation of theForces Act, 1871, and to the recent discussions be-tween representatives of the Treasury and of theRailway Executive Committee, I am directed by theBoard of Trade to state that the Treasury havesignified their readiness to accept the followingclauses as interpreting and amplifying that Agree-ment, on the understanding that the clauses areaccepted in their entirety by all the companies con-cerned.As the matter is one which will have to be dealtwith by the individual Boards of Directors, the Boardof Trade will be obliged if the Railway ExecutiveCommittee will take steps to ascertain whether thecontrolled railway companies are prepared to acceptthe clauses.1. Capital Expenditure.Interest to be allowed upon all sums expended upon(1) works (including in that term rolling stock andplant and also the land used in connection withworks) brought into use since 31st December, 1912,or (2) mineral support acquired since that date underthe mining clause of the Railway Clauses Consolida-tion Act, 1845, or similar statutory provisions, whichare properly chargeable to capital and have in factbeen so charged. Interest to be calculatedfrom 5th August, 1914, or from the datewhen the work was brought into use (or the mineralsupport was acquired), which ever is the laterdate, but, in the case of works broughtinto use (*or mineral support acquired) during theyear 1913, interest to be allowed only for the periodin each year corresponding with the period inter-vening between 31st December, 1912, and the datewhen the work was brought into use (or the mineralsupport acquired). The rate of interest to be 4 percent, per annum up to 31st December, 1915, andafterwards such rate (not being less than 4 per cent,)as shall be agreed between the Treasury and theRailway Executive Committee. Regulations in re-gard to the calculation of interest in the case ofworks brought gradually into use, and generally asto giving effect to this clause, to be agreed betweenthe Government Accountants and the Railway Exe-cutive Committee.The Government to pay forthwith per cent, ofthe amounts claimed under this head in respect ofthe period to 31st December, 1915, and the balancefrom time to time as soon as the amounts duo areagreed.2. Stores.At the end of the period of Government control, acash payment to be made by the Government to eachof the controlled companies equal to the differencebetween (a) the book value of tho stores in stock atthe 5th August, 1914, and (b) the value of the samequantities of similar stores, calculated (1) as to the extent those quantities are in stock atthe end of the control period, at tho stockprices then ruling;(2) as to the shortage in the quantity at the endof the control period as compared with thequantity at the beginning;at replacement prices.The replacement prices to be agreed between theTreasury and the company as fairly representing theprices at which the shortage could be made good,having regard to the quoted market at the end of thecontrol period, the probable movement of prices, andthe other circumstances of the case.Where at the end of the Government control acompany&apos;s stock of any materials is in excess of thequantities of those materials in stock at 5th August,1914, by reason of purchases reasonably made for thepurpose of military or naval traffic or requirements,the Government, in addition to making tho above-mentioned cash payment, at their option either topurchase such excess quantities at cost price or topay to the company fair compensation in respectthereof having regard to the price paid by thera andthe value of the materials to the company.Regulations in regard to the calculation of prices,the definition of stores, and generally as to givingeffect to this clause to be agreed between theGovernment accountants and the Railway ExecutiveCommittee.3. Allowances to dependants of men serving withE.M. Forces.As from the commencement of the period of controlthe Government to bear the cost of any allowancemade by a company in accordance with the CircularLetters issued or to be issued by the Railway Execu-tive Committee on the matter to the dependants ofan employe serving with H.M. Forces (other than acommissioned officer) whether such allowance exceeds10s. a week or not.In the case of commissioned officers, the arrange-ment set out in Circular Letters Nos. 274, 277, 288and 321 issued by the Railway Executive Committeeto continue.4. Damage to railway property by bombardment orhostile aircraft.(1) The Government to bear the cost of makinggood any damage to property or plant (other thanproperty the rent of which would normally be in-cluded in the lower half of Account No. 8 of theStatutory Form of Railway Accounts) caused bybombardment or hostile aircraft (including anydamage which may be caused through measurestaken against such bombardment or hostile air-craft), whether such damage has been or can bemade good during the period of Government controlor not.(2) Any premiums paid in respect of any suchproperty or plant already insured against such risksto be included in the company s ordinary workingexpenditure, and credit to be given to the Govern-ment for any sums received by the companies underpolicies of insurance.(3) In the case of premises held by a company onlease or agreement, and which if owned by the oom-pany would fall within Clause (1), the Government toindemnify the company to the extent of their legalliability under the terms of the lease or agreementin each case.
5. Charges for services rendered by railway com-punies to the Government,The following rules to be observed as regardscharges for services rendered to, or accommodationor other things provided for, Government Depart-nients by controlled railway companies:  (See letter from Sir A. Kaye Butterworth to SirThomas Heath.)6. Itefund of Surcharges.Every company to give an undertaking to repayto the Treasury or to any person nominated by themany sums which on a final settlement of accounts maybo found to have been received or retained by suchcompany in excess of the amount due to them.(6)Enclosure No. 2 to Document 4.Draft Letter to Railway Companies.The Executive Committee have for some time pastbeen in negotiation with tho Treasury with regardto certain points which at present are unprovided for,or not clearly provided for, in the agreement forcompensation, the most important of these being thequestion of an allowance for new capital expenditure,the responsibility for damage by bombardment orhostile aircraft, and the method of dealing withstores at tho end of the period of control. TheExecutive Committee are pleased to state that oneach of the above matters the Government are pre-pared to accopt the contentions of the Committeesubject to an agreement being reached on certainother points, and havo expressed their readiness toenter into an agreement which, in the views of theExecutive Committee, fairly meets the circumstancesof the case. On the other hand, the Governmentattach importance to there being a clearer definitionthan at present exists of those services rendered bythe companies which are to be charged for and eithermade the subject of a special debit or brought intothe monthly revenue statements, and those, .(e.g.,the conveyance of troops and military and navalstores and equipment) in respect of which no chargesare to be raised.The Government also points out that, in view ofthe fact that the monthly accounts of tho companiesare now being paid without deduction, there shouldbo some machinery for securing the repayment ofany over-payments which an examination of theaccounts may disclose.The result of the negotiations has been embodiedin the accompanying letter addressed by the Presidentof the Board of Trade to the Acting Chairman of theExecutive Committee. The proposals set out in thatletter havo been accepted by the companies reprc-sOnted on the Executive Committee, and I have toask you to let me know, for the information of theBoard of Trade, if possible within the next fortnight,whether your Board is prepared to accept them.(7)&quot; The General Manager,&quot;North Eastern Railway,4, Cowley Street,Westminster, S.W.June 23rd, 1916.Dear Sir Thomas Heath,Compensation under the Act of 1871.Referring to our interview this morning, will youkindly let nie have a note of the words which yousuggested should be inserted in the first paragraph ofthe draft letter to the railway companies.With regard to the other documents, the points Ihave noted are:  1. Capital Expenditure.I suggested that the rate of interest on capitalexpenditure should be 4 per cent, permanently, andthat in the last paragraph relating to capital ex-penditure the percentage to be inserted should be90 per cent., and the date altered to 30th June, 1916.I understood that you would consider these suggos-tions, but that, in any case, you thought it would bonecessary that the first payment should be spreadover two or three months for budgeting reasons.2. Stores.Tho paragraph on the top of page 3 you will referto Sir William Plender, and I suggested that itmight be well for him to discuss the paragraph with,tho General Manager or Accountant of the SouthEastern Company, as I know that company is affectedby it,3. Allowances to Dependants.You desired somo reference to tho four-fifths limit,and I promised to sond you a short memorandumexplaining tho cases in which tho allowances exceedthe four-fifths limit, and also to send you details ofthe arrangements with regard to commissionedofficers.5. Charges for Services.You explained to me generally what had takenplace at ycsterday&apos;s mooting, and stated that, fromthe point of view of the Treasury, it was very desir-able that the regulations should be agreed andinserted in tho circular to be sent to tho companies.6. Refund of Surcharges.You said you thought that companies ought torefund surcharges with interest at the same rate asis paid by the Government to the railway companiesin cases where there is delay in payment for workdone at cost price.I mentioned the case of rents and the recent claimof the Government to have the benefit of &quot; below thelino &quot; premises on payment of loss, and I also men-tioned the question of income tax in connection withinterest on capital. As to the latter point, I assumethat the payments made by the Government will beafter deducting the tax current in the period inrespect of which tho interest has accrued.Yours faithfully,(Signed) A. Kaye Butteuwohth.Sir Thomas Heath,Treasury Chambers, S.W.(8)London, E.C.15th July, 1916.Sir Thomas L. Heath, K.C.B.,Treasury Chambers, S.W.My dear Sia,State Contkol of Railways.We have considered the letter proposed to bewritten to the Railway Executive Committee andthat proposed to be written by the Executive Coni-rnittee to the railway companies, drafts of both olwhich you sent us with your letter of the 26th ulto.Referring to the letter to the Railway ExecutiveCommittee, which embodies notes of the six clausesproposed to be adopted as interpreting and amplify-.iug the original agreement, we have the followingcomments to make :  1. Capital Expenditure.We think that the proposed inclusion of land used&apos; in connection with works brought into use since 31stDecember, 1912, and mineral support acquired inconnection with lines actually in use, is reasonable,and that the clause may properly bo amplified inthis respect. It should be provided in any regula-tiion that may be framed that in ascertaining thecapital expenditure on which interest is to be calcu-lated,. deduction must bo made for the value of worksreplaced.We think that, in order to make clear the pro-visions as to interest in respect of works broughtinto use in the year 1913 some slight rearrangement.
of the wording of the proposed clause might headvisable, which might take some such shape as thefollowing:  1. Works brought into use (or mineral supportacquired) during 1913.Interest to be allowed thereon in 1914 from5th August to tho date corresponding to the datein 1913 when the works were brought into U6e(or mineral support acquired) and in subsequentyears of control for the period in those yearswhich corresponds with tho period in 1913 duringwhich the works were not in use (or mineral sup-port not acquired).2. Works brought into use (or mineral supportacquired) during 1914 or in subsequentyears.(a) Prior to the 5th August, 1914.Interest to be allowed thereon from the 5thAugust, 1914, throughout the period of control.(b) Prom the 5th August, 1914.Interest to be allowed thereon from the datewhen such works were brought into- use (ormineral support acquired) and throughout theremainder of the period of control.We are of opinion that the rate of 4 per cent,should be regarded as fixed for the whole period ofcontrol.We consider that 90 per cent, is too high a pro-portion of the claims for interest to be paid beforethey have been adjusted and agreed, and suggestthat the Government might undertake to pay say85 per cent, of the interest claimed in respect of theperiod to 31st December, 1915, in three equal monthlyinstalments and the balance on the amount due beingagreed on behalf of the Government. It would bebetter that the ascertainment of interest due shouldbe annual rather than half-yearly, so following thepractice with regard to the ascertainment of thegeneral claim for compensation.The question of Income Tax on the interest whichSir A. Kaye Butterworth refers to at the close of hisletter of the 23rd ult., is one which must, no doubt,be decided by the Inland Revenue Authorities.2. Stores.The clause as drafted appears to carry out thearrangement which has been come to, but to avoidmisunderstanding, we would suggest that the expres-eion &quot;Book Values&quot; should be substituted for &quot;StockPrices &quot; in the paragraph numbered 1, and we thinkthat it would be advisable that replacement pricesshould be agreed by the Treasury with the RailwayExecutive Committee rather than with individualcompanies. It should be specified that any amountsalready received by the companies for replacementvalue of material used on work done for the Govern-ment must be brought into account when fixing theamount to be allowed under this clause.3.

Forces\It appears that, as a general rule, these allowancesdo not exceed 4/5,ths of a man&apos;s railway pay, butcertain minimum payments are made which, in somecases among the lower paid grades, have the effectof bringing the total allowances above that limit.If the intention is to confirm the present practice,the clause as drafted might stand, provided that theauthority of the Government should be stipulated forany change, in which event the clause mightbe amended by substituting for the words &quot; Circularletters issued or to be issued by the Railway Exe-cutive Committee,&quot; the words &quot; Circular lettersalready issued or Avhich may, with the assent of theGovernment, be hereafter issued by the RailwayExecutive Committee.&quot;We understand that tho arrangement made by theRailway Executive Committee, with regard to pay-ments to commissioned officers, is that the paymentscharged against the Government shall not exceedtwo-thirds of their railway pay, with the furtherproviso that tho total sum received by the officersshall not exceed tho total salary thoy were receivingon the outbreak of war.4. Damage to Hallway Property by Bombardmentor Hostile Aircraft.The provisions of this clause call for no comment.5. Charges for Services Hendered by Hallway Com-panies to the Government.We note that, as discussion is still proceeding be-tween the Government Departments concerned andthe officers of the Railway Executive Committee, theform of this Clause cannot yet be considered.6. Hefund of Surcharges (Adjustment of Accountswith Companies).The companies should no doubt give undertakingsto repay to the Treasury or to any person nominatedby them, any sums which, on a final settlement oftho accounts of any period ending 31st December,may be found to have been received or retained bythem in excess of the amounts due to them, and itwould seem reasonable that they should pay intereston such sums at 5 per cent., the rate which webelieve the Government was paying to the railwaycompanies in cases where there was delay in paymentfor work done at cost price. Payment of interestmight run from the 1st March following the close ofany such period.Subject to the foregoing suggestions, we thinkthat the letter proposed to be written by the Boardof Trade to the Acting-Chairman of the RailwayExecutive Committee is such as the Treasury mayproperly agree to, subject to the omission of theparagraph on page 3, (&quot; Where at the end of theGovernment control .... the value of thematerials to the company &quot;). Sir Alexander Butter-worth thinks that if an understanding exists betweenthe Government and the Executive on the linesreferred to in our communication to you of to-day&apos;sdate on the subject of stores, it is unnecessary torefer -specifically to the question in the Board ofTrade&apos;s letter to the Executive. There are goodgrounds for this view, which Sir Alexander Butter-worth will explain verbally.We approve the draft letter to the railwaycompanies, as altered in red ink.Yours very truly,(Slgned) 1 Albert W. Wyon.(9)Treasury, S.W.19th July, 1916.Dear Mr. Wyon,I am much obliged for your letters of 15th instantreporting on the suggested terms for settlement ofoutstanding questions with the railway companies,I have had some conversation with Sir John Brad-bury, and there is one point with which, on presentinformation, we do not feel quite satisfied. It is asto the propriety of including sums spent on &quot; mineralsupport &quot; as part of the capital expenditure on whichwe are to pay interest.If we understand the matter rightly, this expondi-ture seems to be hardly on the same footing asexpenditure on land. Our impression is that thequestion of &quot; mineral supports &quot; arises in this way.A quantity of land was bought for the constructionof a line many years back, let us say. The companyat that time bought the surface of the land, but nominerals thereunder, and took an option to buy thominerals at a later date if it proved necessary byreason of the mine-owners&apos; operations coming nearand threatening the safety of the line. The cost ofbuying the minerals was therefore a, deferred liabilitywhich might - mature at any moment.Now, by hypothesis, the point of our paying intereston unproductive capital expenditure is that, but fortho Government having taken over the lines, it wouldhave been productive during the period of control,but, as it is, the company are debarred by the
Government occupation from earning tho expectedrevenue, since wo are only making up the net receiptsto the amount at which they stood before the warand before the expenditure became productive.This, however, doe3 not seem to bo the case asregards expenditure on &quot; mineral support.&quot; Atwhatever time the expenditure was incurred, whetherbefore or during the period of control, the expenditurewould have produced no new revenue whatever; itwould only have been instrumental in preserving theold revenue. Consequently the fact of the Govern-ment taking over the railways has not in this caseprevented the company from earning interest whichthey would otherwiso have earned, as in the othercase of capital spent on new works or land requiredfor such works; and there would seem, therefore,to be no ground on which the Government can becalled upon to pay interest on capital spent onacquiring the mineral supports.I should be glad if you would favour me with yourfurther observations on this point.I am writing in similar terms to Sir W. Plender.Yours very truly,(Signed)     T. L. Heath.a(10)London, E.C.,21st July, 1916.Sir Thomas Heath, K.C.B.,Treasury, S.W.Dear Sir Thomas Heath,State Control of Railways.The explanation of what constitutes &quot; mineralsupport &quot; is correctly set out in your letter of tho19th instant.Where mineral support has been acquired inrespect of lines open for traffic since 31st December,1912, it is part of the cost on which the allowancefor interest should be calculated, as the whole costis a new revenue-producing asset.Where mineral support has been acquired since31st December, 1912, in respect of lines open beforethat date, we considered that as the expenditure wasa necessity for the purpose of safeguarding existingrevenue, it was not unreasonable that an allowanceshould be made. For example, if support had notbeen acquired and a subsidence occurred due tomineral working so that trains could not run withsafety until the line was repaired, there would be inthe interval a diminution of earnings which theGovernment would have to meet in the shape of anincreased deficiency.We were careful in our letter to limit the allow-ance to mineral support in respect of lines alreadyopen, as we do not consider anything should beconceded for such a purpose in respect of lines notvet brought into use.We are,Yours faithfully,(Signed)W.

Wyon, Esq.3, Fredericks Place,Old Jewry, E.C.(12)Enclosure to Document No. 11.Interest on Capital Expenditure.Regulations in respect of Claims for Interest onCapital Expenditure.1. Definition of Capital Expenditure.Capital expenditure means sums charged to capital(including expenditure on leased and worked lines, or,in the case of land subject to a rent charge or feuduty, the capitalised value of such rent charge or feuduty, calculated at 25 years&apos; purchase, in connectionwith:  (1) The first seven items in Account No. 8 in respectof lines, works, rolling stock and plant (here-inafter &quot;described as &quot; works, &amp;c.&quot;) broughtinto&apos; use during or subsequent to the year1913 irrespective of the period during whichthe expenditure was incurred:(2) Purchase money  or compensation  paid  formineral support acquired under the miningclauses of the Railways Clauses Con soli da-tion Act, 1845, or similar statutory pro-visions, during or subsequent to the year1913, in respect of lines, &amp;e, actually in use.The cost of any works replaced to be deducted fromthe capital expenditure on any new works upon thecost of which interest is charged.2. Works, &amp;c, brought into use in sections.In the case of works, &amp;c, sections of which arebrought into use from time to time, interest to beallowed upon the cost of the section brought into usein so far as that can be separated from the cost ofthe remainder of the work, together with a propor-tion of such items of cost as cannot be so separatedcorresponding to the proportion of the entire workwhich is brought into use.3. Land.Except in the case of land the rent of which wouldbefore the construction of the works, &amp;e, in question,have normally been included in the lower half ofAccount No. 8, the purchase price of the land uponwhich any of such works, &amp;c., are constructed shallnot be taken into account unless it can be shewn thatit was specifically acquired for such purpose.4. Certificates.The actual dates upon which the works, &amp;e, orsections of works, etc., are completely brought intouse must be ascertained, and the following certifi-cates given by the company&apos;s chief departmentalofficer concerned:  (a) Dates for Works, &amp;c.That the works, &amp;c, or section of works, &amp;e,specified were brought into use on tho datesshown.(b) Allocation  of  costs  us   between  differentsections of work.That so far as the expenditure can be dividedbetween the respective sections of work, &amp;c,the expenditure shown is solely in respect of thesection or sections brought into use, ,and that inthose items the cost of which cannot be dividedbetween the respective sections (such as excava-tions, under-structures, station roofs, &amp;c), the
expenditure shown is the proportion of the wholecorresponding to the proportion of the entirework which is brought into use.(c) Land.That the land upon which the works, &amp;c, wereconstructed was specifically acquired, for suchpurpose, or that the rent of such land would be-fore the construction of the works, &amp;c, in ques:tion have normally been included in the lowerhalf of Account No. 8.e, Calculation of Interest.(a) Bate to be 4 per cent, per annum.(b) Works, (fee, brought into use during 1913.Interest to be calculated during the controlperiod, for such portions of that period as corres-pond with the period in 1913 prior to the dateon which the work was brought into use, e.g.:  Works, &amp;c, brought into use, April 1st, 1913. Interest will be allowed during the controlfor the months of January, February andMarch in the year 1915, and for thesemonths in subsequent years.Works, die, brought into use, October 1st,1913. Interest will be allowed during thecontrol for the months of January to Sep-teinber inclusive, i.e., from 5th August to30th September in the period to 31stDecember, 1914, and for the first ninemonths of 1915, and for these months insubsequent years.(c) Works, &amp;c, brought into use during theperiod January 1st to August 5th, 1914.Interest to be calculated throughout the controlperiod.(d) Works, etc., brought into use subsequent toAugust 5th, 1914.Interest to be calculated as from the date onwhich the work is brought into use and through-out the remainder of the control period.6. These regulations are supplementary to and notin substitution for the arrangement set out inExecutive Committee Circular Letter No.(13)London, E.C.,29th September, 1916.W.

In the case of non-programme companies, assuming such companies hadbeen compelled to reiy upon the claim for arrearsof maintenance for an allowance in respect ofdeferred renewal work, cases would arise where, owingto abnormal repair work having been carried out,the arrears of maintenance statement would haveresulted in an excess figure, and in such cases thecompanies concerned would obtain no allowance fordeferred renewal work, whereas under similar con-ditions the programme companies would suffer nosuch hardship.32016D
APPENDIX XXII.Submitted by Sir Albert Wyon.3, Fredericks Place,Old Jewry,London, E.C.2.13th January, 1921.E. Twentyman, Esq.,Secretary,Departmental Committee onRailway Agreements.Deur Mr. Twentyman,Departmental Committee on Railway Agreements.I have read through the printed proof of evidencegiven by me on tho 22nd December last, which youforwarded to me on the 30th ult., and I enclose anote of certain textual alterations which I have alsomarked in red ink on the proof which I return.There are certain other matters which arise out ofthe questions put to me and my reported replies,upon which I think it necessary that the Committeeshould have before them the following furtherobservations:  Questions 3466 and 3467.I have taxed my memory in connection with thesuggestion that an investigators&apos; report was takenback and altered, and have consulted my assistants,but I find that no such case is known to us.I should therefore be glad if a note to this effectcould be attached to my reply to Question 3467.Questions 3590, 3591, and 3594.I have referred to my papers in connection withthe case referred to in these questions, and find thatthe facts are as follows :  This matter was first raised in the railwayinvestigators&apos; report upon the account of the com-pany which had charged the &quot; toll &quot; above the line(Le., against the Government). The point was there-fore disclosed as soon as this report reached me, andnot in the manner indicated in my reply to Question3594. My decision was arrived at prior to the incep-tion of the Ministry of Transport.On consideration I think it hardly correct to saythat the point might not have emerged unless theclaims of the two companies were compared. As afact the transaction in question was not in theordinary course, and therefore the investigator&apos; w7asbound to report it, which, as a matter of fact, hedid. I think it desirable that a note to this effectbe attached to my replies to these questions.Questions 3720, 3743, 3744.Some misunderstanding seems to have arisen inconnection with the amounts allowed to the com-panies as additional provisions in respect of theincreased first cost of rolling stock in service.While I am in general agreement with the propo-sition that a company having been allowed in theaccount of net receipts a certain sum in this respectand having a claim for arrears of maintenance is atpresent permitted by means of that claim to increasethe sum allowed by 15 per cent., I do not considerthat in the case of a company which has no claimfor Arrears of Maintenance, anything is paid to thembeyond the sum to which they are entitled. I findthat when Question 3743 (which implies that anamount is so paid) wras put to me, I am reportedto have said, &quot; That may be so,&quot; but when thequestion is repeated in another way (No. 3744), Iam stated to have replied in the affirmative.In order that my views in this matter may beclearly before the Committee, I add the followingremarks: -As to companies who have a claim for Arrears ofMaintenance :  Although there is undoubtedly a possibility of anover-payment under the present arrangements, over-payment will, on final settlement, be found to havearisen only if the 15 per cent, addition to the amountsallowed on account of Increased First Cost increasesthat sum to a figure exceeding such an allowancecalculated at the prices ruling at the end of Control,Le., assuming that as at present proposed it is con-ceded that the companies are entitled to make theirprovisions for renewals falling Que after the termina-tion of Control at the rates ruling at the close ofControl. It is clear that allowances conceded in, say,1916 and 1917 and based on the additional cost ofrenewal in those years, even when increased by 15 percent., will not be sufficient to meet the ultimate costof carrying out the work, which it has been suggestedwill amount to a 200 per cent, addition to the 1913base.As to companies who have no claim for Arrearsof Maintenance no over-payment can arise.This statement I may be permitted to illustrate bythe following example :  Assume:1913 quantum of Renewals.........    100Expenditure in 1921 upon Renewals    ...     318Increased Cost assessed at:  66$ per cent, of 1921 expenditure, or200 per cent, of 1913 expenditure.Example (a).Charge for Renewals in 1921, assuming the companyare entitled to an allowance of  6 for the &quot; IncreasedFirst Cost &quot; of Rolling Stock in service in 1921. 1. 1913 quantum...............   1002. Allowance for &quot; Increased First Cost &quot; ofRolling Stock in Service    .........     63. Increased Cost of all necessary Renewal.     . work carried out, viz.: 663 per cent, of 318     ..................212Total permissible charge......   318Shown in Account of the Net Receipts thus:-Expenditure      ...............318Total of Abstract (Renewals only)  ...  318Example (b).Charge for Renewals in 1921 if the company arenot entitled to such ati allowance. 1. 1913 quantum.........      ......   1002......................Nil3. Increased Cost of all necessary Renewalwork carried out, viz.: 66f per cent, of 318    ..................212Total permissible charge......   312Shown in Account of the Net Receipts thus: -Expenditure      ...............&apos; 318Less-Transfer to Fund (Credit)    ......     6Total of Abstract (Renewals only)  ...  312I have taken two examples, in one of which (a) thecompany has been conceded an allowance of  6 onaccount of Increased First Cost, and in the other (b)the company has not been allowed this concession.The amount charged against the Government in thocase of thefirst example is      ............    318and in the second example is     ......    312or an increase of.........      6 only.It will be seen by a comparison of the two examplesthat the sum of  212 is chargeable against the Govern-ment in both cases as it represents increased costarising upon necessary renewal work actually carriedout.The amount of tho quantum (whether or not in-creased on the ground of increased first cost) has noeffect on the calculation of the allowance for increasedcost of renewal work executed.
The decision of tho Ministry of Transport to allowto the companies excess cost due to increased pricesupon necessary renewals was communicated by theMinistry to mo in October, 1919, and has been com-municated to the companies.As indicated in my reply to Question 3698, I am ofopinion that the Company is entitled to charge theGovernment with the whole of this increased cost, asit represents the shortage arising upon the provisionsof the past, and the amount chargeable in this waymust be distinguished from tho  100 and tho  6 inexample (a) which I look upon as provisions for therenewals of the future.The figures employed in tho preceding examplesaro based on the unlikely assumption that the com-pany concerned in example (a) actually spent theexact sum it was entitled to charge. This beingassumed, a result is obtained in which the amountchargeable is exactly three times the 1913 quantumplus three times the allowance for increased first cost.I also give a further illustration (Example &quot; C &quot;),which further illustrates the view I havo taken.Example (c).(Excess of Repairs Throughout.)Assume a company provides  100 per annum inrespect of 33 wagons costing  100 each, equal to a 33years&apos; life, or 3-1 /33rd per cent, on cost.At the end of 33 years they have to renew them all,and, presuming this is done in 1921, they find thateach wagon costs  300 to renew (an increase of 66^per cent.). Their expenditure in 1921 is therefore 9,900.  Their permissible charge for renewals is:          Increased cost of work done 66 if percent, of  9,900 .........&apos;    ... 6,6001913 quantum       ............ 100Increased First Cost Allowance, viz.:1st Cost 1913    ............3,3001st Cost 1921    ...Increased First Cost9,900...   6,600At 33 years&apos; lile (3-1 /33rd percent.)     ...     .........Total permissible charge......2006,900          Abstract M in 1921 (Renewals only)Expended ............ 9,900Less: Transfer to debit of Fund Ex-penditurc of 1921 equated to 1913basis    ...............3,300Less: Provision for the year 1921     300-   3,000 6,900After consideration of the subject, which has neces-sarily been fuller than 1 was able to give to it in thecourse of my examination before the Committee, iwish to convey to the Committee my view with regardto companies who have claimed and obtained allow-ance on account of increased first cost. Among thesecompanies which have claims for arrears of mainten-ance, it may eventually bo found that there aro somewhoso claims will require adjustment on the finalsettlement of their claims for increased cost, but nosuch necessity for adjustment will arise in the caseof companies having no claim for arrears of main-tenancc.Questions 3762 and 3772.In connection with the suggestion that these ques-tions appear to contain, viz. : that a company shouldprovide out of the increased rates tho whole of theincreased cost of renewal of its wagons, and thattherefore the present allowance for increased firstcost in effect constitutes a double payment totho company, 1 would point out that theallowance referred to is granted to meet the instal-nient of the liability for renewal which falls withinthe control period, and that during this period theincroased rates do not accrue to the benefit of thecompanies. It will not be until after the controlthat the companies will receive the benefit of thoincreased rates, and then the renewal instalmentswill wholly fall upon them.Having regard to these considerations I should liketo withdraw my reply to Question 3762.Question 3765.I find that my reply to this question is not strictlycorrect, as in the circumstances referred to therenewed wagon would, of course, still stand on thecompany&apos;s capital account at its original cost, viz., 100, but would bo included in the inventory ofrolling stock at its renewed cost, viz.,  200.Perhaps a note to this effect attached to my replymay be useful.Renewal Fund Account.Dr.1921            1921  Deo. 31.

When considered inconjunction with the present arrears of maintenancearrangement, I have found that the Governmentaccount would in certain circumstances be over-charged if the companies were permitted to set offan excess charge for renewals in one abstract againsta deficiency of renewals in the other. I have there-fore insisted that no such process may be employedwhen preparing the accounts of the net receipts.Yours very truly,(Signed)  ALBERT WYON.Cr. 3,600.  3,600
Statement op Evidence submitted by Sin William Plendeu.1 have conferred with Sir Albert Wyon and haveread his proof of evidenco dated the 4th instant, withwhich I am in agreement.1 was invited (in a letter from Sir William Mar-wood dated the 21st June, 1915) to act in a similarcapacity as Mr. Gurney Fowler in regard to the claimsof those railways whoso accounts were audited byMr. Gurney Fowler&apos;s firm, or any member thereof,or in respect of which his firm acted as professionalaccountants.The companies falling under these categories areas follows:  British Baihuays. *Great Eastern Railway.Great Northern Railway.Isle of Wight Railwayi.London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway.London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway.London &amp; North Western Railway.Metropolitan Railway.Metropolitan District Railway.North Eastern Railway.North London Railway.South Eastern Railway.South Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway CompaniesManaging Committee.Irish Railways.Dublin &amp; South Eastern Railway.Dundalk, Newry &amp; Greenore Railway.Great Southern &amp; Western Railway.Midland Great Western Railway.The letter previously referred to from Sir WilliamMarwood reads:  &quot; The Board of Trade, in consultation with theTreasury, considered the question as to the scopeof the examination to which the accounts of thecompanies should be subjected on behalf of theGovernment; and, seeing that the accounts of allcompanies are at present subject to an audit, whichis entirely independent of the management of thecompanies, they were of opinion that payments canproperly be made upon certificates by these inde-pendent auditors, subject to a general scrutiny ofthe character hereafter referred to.&quot; It was proposed that, in the first place, thecompanies themselves should prepare drafts ofcertain Instructions and Schedules, that thesedrafts should be submitted to the Board of Trade,and that, when finally settled, they should be issuedthrough the companies to their accountants, whowould prepare the accounts on the lines thus laiddown. This procedure was, as you know, followed,and the Instructions have, it is understood, beenissued to all the companies whose undertakingswere taken over under the Act.&quot;It is further proposed that the accounts willin due course be audited by the professional audi-tors of the companies, and will ultimately be sub-mitted to the Board of Trade with a view to thefinal payment of compensation when the controlperiod has come to an end. Before being finallypassed for payment, the certified claims, will bereferred to a consulting accountant, whose dutyit will bo to satisfy himself that the principles laiddown in the instructions have been followed, andbe will also consider more particularly the methodsadopted in regard to such matters as depreciationand tho allotment of charges between Revenueand Capital Accounts. Tho consulting accountantwould rely, in the main, on the certificates of theprofessional auditors of the companies, and con-duct detailed investigations only if and whenquestions arise in the course of examination whichappear to make such investigations necessary, andhe would also be generally responsible for seeingthat the claims aro in order.&quot;It is my practice to consider the Claims, togetherwith the supporting statements and Reports from theInvestigating Accountants, and tho Accountants Sub-Committee; and with the Reports when made of theCompensation Accounts Sub-Committee, and I satisfymyself that the Claims submitted are in accordancewith the terms of the original Agreement betweenHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the Railway Com-panies and the various Regulations issued as supple-mental thereto; or if not, I have required amendmentof the claims after consultation when deemed desir-able or necessary with the Board of Trade and laterwith the Ministry of Transport.From time to time, Sir Albert Wyon and I havejointly considered various questions of principle orinterpretation and have benefited by the mutualexchange of views.In my judgment, the arrangements made for theexamination of the compensation claims submittedby the companies have been business-like in safe-guarding the interests of the State, including as theydo the imposition of the following checks:  (1) The certification of the claims both by theaccountant to the company, and by thecompany&apos;s auditors or professionalaccountants.(2) An examination and report by the inde-pendent investigators.(3) A general scrutiny and minuted approval orqualification by the Accountants Sub-Com-mittee of the Railway Executive.(4) The report of the Compensation Accounts Sub-Committee.(5) The careful scrutiny and examination by mycolleague and myself, who have been con-tinuously in touch with the Board of Tradeor Ministry of Transport; and(6) The general supervisory inquiry by the Comp-troller arid Auditor General.The other classes of claims, i.e., Arrears of Main-tenance and Renewal Work and Interest on Capitalare signed by the Chief Accountant of the claimantcompany, and pass through the tests numbered (2) to(6) as above.7th December, 1920.
Submitted by Sik(Vide Questions Nos. 4032, 40755, London Wall Buildings,London, E.C.2.8th January, 1921.E. Twentyman, Esq.,Secretary,Departmental Committeeon Railway Agreements.Dear Mr. Twentyman,I am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo.The first question asked is:  &quot; .(1) Do you consider that if (a) the companies have enjoyed their full netreceipts of 1913 during the controlperiod,(b) the   Government   has   paid   the   fullliability, whatever it may prove to be,for arrears of maintenance,(c) the companies&apos; undertakings are handedback to them at the end of control inthe same state as they were takenover that the companies are entitled under the spiritof the Agreement to enjoy the benefits of in-creased revenue &apos; below the line &apos; in additionto the guaranteed net receipts arising fromthe payments made to them on account ofarrears of maintenance, which, as indicated,would appear to account for increased receiptsunder this head amounting to an aggregate ofabout  2,500,000 during the three years 1917-1919 in the case of fourteen companies only? &quot;The difficulty in giving an answer to this question,without any qualifying observations, is that the latterpart of the question assumes that the increasedreceipts   below-the-line   shown    by   Sir    GeorgeBeharrell&apos;s statement* enclosed in your letter are dueonly to interest earned on payments made to thecompanies on account of arrears of maintenance.   Aconsideration of the facts shows that the variationsin the item of interest were due to a variety ofcauses; and further that the increase in the netcredit, representing the difference between the receiptsand the payments in connection with the items below-the-line, is not necessarily a measure of the benefitobtained by the companies vis-a-vis the Government.For example, the increase in the net credit itemsof interest would be largely contributed to by:(a) The income from the investment of the in-crease since 1st January, 1914, of funds(General Reserve, Superannuation, Pro-vident, and Savings Bank Balances, Depre-ciation and Renewal Funds other thanArrears of Maintenance) with which theGovernment control is not concerned; and(b) The higher rates of interest obtainable duringthe war, as compared with 1913, on Bankdeposits, Treasury Bills, Exchequer Bonds,and other Government securities.The amount received from the Government forarrears of maintenance has presumably been used toa considerable extent in financing the excess value ofthe stocks of stores over and above the pre-warvalue this excess value being due to the great risein the prices of stores.* Appendix V.illiam plendek.d 4085 in Minutes of Evidence.)In view of the above considerations, 1 do not feelable to state that the companies should not enjoythe benefits of increased revenue below-the-line inaddition to the guaranteed net receipts.The second question asked is :  &quot; (2) If it be the case that the charges for main-tenauce in the year 1913 included certain sumsby way of provision placed to augmenting pro-vision accounts, would not the spirit under-lying the 1914 agreement be satisfied bycharging the Government with (1) the cost of physical repairs on the basisof 1913 physical repairs adjusted tocurrent prices;(2) the actual amount of tho 1913 provisionsplaced to augmenting provisionaccounts in that year without anyadjustment in respect of increase inprices.&quot;In regard to the above question I assume that:  (a) In referring to &quot; repairs &quot; under paragraphnumbered (1), it is intended that this ex-pression shall cover renewals carried out, asthe &quot; augmenting provisions &quot; referred to inthe paragraph numbered (2), refer to unspentrenewals;(b) That 1 am to disregard any allowances forrepairs or renewals in respect of increasedunits brought into service.The spirit underlying the 1914 agreement wouldnot be met under the proposal contained in thequestion in the case of a company whose allowancefor renewals was based on its 1913 provision if theexpression used in the question of &quot; charging theGovernment &quot; limits the Government&apos;s full liabilityin this respect only to the amount of the unspent1913 provision. The company would be placed in anunfair position if the renewals actually undertakenduring the control period fell short of its full pro-vision in 1913, seeing that it would presumably haveto complete, sooner or later, its renewal programmeafter the control period had ended, and would nothave accumulated a fund during the control periodto meet the enhanced costs.The regulations interpreting the agreement in thisrespect were designed with a view to removing suchan anomaly, and to place a company in approximatelythe same position at the termination of control,whether it had or had not actually expended itsrenewal allowance during the control period.If, at the end of control, the Government acceptthe liability of meeting the renewal programme un-fulfilled during control, there is some reason forconsidering the limitation of the payments duringcontrol in respect of unspent provisions to the amountthereof, without adding the percentage, namely,15 per cent., for higher costs.I am,Yours faithfully,W. Ptjsndeji,
Puecis of Evidence to be given uy Siu Alexander Buttekwobtii before theDepartmental Committee on Railway Agreements,Preliminary.Witness will say that he is the general managerof the North Eastern Railway, and has held thatposition since 1906.That he also was a member of the RailwayExecutive Committee from its inception.Witness at the outset will refer to the letter ofthe 10th November, 1920, from Sir Herbert Walkerto the secretary of Lord Colwyn&apos;s Committee, inwhich he stated that he had had an opportunity ofconsulting those general managers who were his col-leagues on the Railway Executive Committee, andthat alter carefully considering the request that heshould give evidence before the Committee, as actingchairman of the Railway Executive Committee, theywere unanimously of opinion that it would bo im-proper for any one of them to take this action, inview of what they understood to be the scope of theenquiry to bo held by the Committee and of tho factthat the agreements in question affected the rightsof individual companies and might be tho subject oflitigation.He will say that in view of tho fact that in thePress it had been freely stated (without any refer-once to the terms of this letter) that the generalmanagers had refused to assist the Committee, howould like to explain that the only thing that madethe general managers reluctant to appear before theCommittee was the fear that, having regard to theirterms of reference, a witness might be placed in aposition which would lay him open to the charge ofhaving prejudiced the position of companies on whosebehalf he had no right to speak.He will explain that the general managers wereunder the impression that the Committee would beable to obtain all the information they required fromGovernment officials, but that from tho first they hadbeen desirous of giving the Committee all the infor-mation in their power and assisting them in theirduties so far as they could properly do so.Witness will state that he is not representing theviews of the former Railway Executive Committee,still less the views of the railway companies ingeneral, only twelve of which -were represented onthat Committee, and will explain the circumstanceswhich led to his being asked to give the informationdesired by the Committee.Witness on his own behalf wishes to make it clearto the members of the Committee that he is desirousof rendering them all the assistance in his power.He realizes that it may not always be easy, if oneis to speak with the freedom and frankness that i6desirable, to avoid at times giving utterance to ex-pressions of opinion, or at any rate disclosing or im-plying-views, as to the position between the partiesor the ideas and intentions underlying transactions.But if this should prove to be the case, he desiresit to be very clearly understood that, so far as anyexpression or implication of views is concerned, herepresents no one but himself (not even his owncompany and still less his former colleagues on theRailway Executive Committee) and he comes beforethe Committee on the distinct understanding thatnone of the companies will be prejudiced in any wayby anything that he may say in the course of hisevidence.Formation of Railway Executive Committee andNegotiations leading up to the original Com-pensation Agreement.   &apos;Witness will detail the negotiations for settling theterms of compensation during the few days imme-dately preceding the outbreak of war.He will quote the terms originally suggested bythe Government and read at apmeeting of the RailwayExecutive Committee on 31st July, 1914, and thememorandum submitted to tho Board of Trade bythe Railway Executive Committee in reply.In this connection he will refer to the statementmade by Sir William (then Mi.) Marwood that theLaw Officers considered it would bo necessary for anagreement to bo made; with the railways as to thedisposal of tho receipts.Witness will quote tho proposal made to tho Boardof Trade by the Railway Executive Committee onthe 3rd August, 1914, and will refer to a memorandumprepared by tho Railway Executive Committee ontho following day giving theii reasons for makingthis proposal.Witness will refer to&apos;the acceptance by the Govern-rnent on the 6th August of tho Railway ExecutiveCommittee proposal, subject to tho addition of a&quot; proviso,&quot; ami to tho stops taken by the RailwayExeeutivo Committee to obtain tho assent of all thocontrolled railway companies to tho arrangement;quoting from the official lotto! issued to tho com-panies tho reasons which led the Railway ExecutiveCommittoo to recommend acceptance.Witness will refer to the public announcement onthe 5th August with regard to tho control of therailways, and also to tho letter from the War Officeto each railway company tolling them to carry onas usual subject to the instructions of tho ExecutiveCommittee.Witness will then proceed to deal with the stopstaken by the Railway Executive Committee to pro-vent companies taking advantage of the Govern-meut guarantee to spend money extravagantly or toimprove their plant at the expense of tho Govern-mont, and will refer to a letter dated 9th August,1914, to the Board of Trade on this matter, sayingthat the Railway Executive Committee had thematter in hand.Witness will proceed to detail the steps taken bythe Railway Executive Committee to secure, as faras possible, the economical working of the railwaysduring the Government control,In this connection witness will refer to the settingup of the Accountants&apos; Committee (dealt with morefully later in the proof) and also to a circular letterwhich was issued to the companies on the 13thAugust, which sets out fully the policy adopted bythe Railway Executive Committee, and to a letterdated 13th September, 191.4, notifying to the Boardof Trade the acceptance of the agreement by allcompanies.Definition   of  the   Term   &quot;Net   Receipts&quot;   andPeriodical Payments on Account.Witness will refer to the necessity which aroseearly in the Control period for some definition ofy net receipts,&quot; and also for periodical payments tobe made on account, neither of which points awereprovided for under the original agreement.He will explain the connection between these twopoints, and will detail the negotiations with theGovernment with regard to them up to the 12thOctober, 1914.Extension of Compensation Agreement to 1915.Witness will state the steps taken in connectionwith the extension of the compensation agreementto the year 1915.He will also refer to the negotiations leading upto the arrangement under which part of the firstwar bonus was borne by the railway companies as aset-off against the &quot; proviso,&quot; which the Governmentagreed to drop as from the 1st January, 1915.Witness will explain the views of the railwaycompanies with regard to this matter, and will givefigures showing the financial effect of tho &quot; proviso &quot;and of tho arrangement above referred to.Supplemental Clauses (Pink Book).Witness will refer to the circumstances which ledto the consideration of these Clauses, and in this
connection to the questions whether surplus receiptsbelonged to the Government or to the railwaycompanies, and how far it was open to the companiesto raise charges against the Government.Witness will refer to the meeting at the Boardof Trade on 23rd July, 1915, and to Sir WilliamMarwood&apos;s letter of the 1st September, 1915, on thoquestion of charging Government traffic.Witness will explain the various points of inter-pretation or amplification of the original agreementwhich the railway companies considered should besettled, and will refer to a meeting on the 2ndNovomber, 1915, with Sir Thomas Heath and SirJohn Bradbury, at which a request was made forthese points to be tabulated; to a memorandum pre-pared by him and handed to the Treasury inDecember, 1915, and to a second meeting with SirThomas Heath and Sir John Bradbury on the 4thJanuary, 1916, at which agreement in principle wasarrived at, subject to certain information beingsupplied as to tho financial result of the variousproposals.Witness will refer to the approximate estimateswhich were supplied to the Treasury, and to subse-quent discussions, first, with the Government account-ants on the 31st January, 1916; and, secondly, withthe Treasury officials on the 29th March, 1916, whichultimately resulted in tho Pink Book being issued asan agreed document,Witness will enumerate the six points dealt within the Pink Book, and the other points originally putforward by the Railway Executive Committee, andwill explain the reasons underlying each point, andthe result of the negotiations under the followingheads:  (1) Capital Expenditure.(2) Stores.(3) The &quot; Proviso.&quot;(4) War Bonus.(5) Renewal of Permanent Way and Rolling Stock.(6) Allowances to Dependants.(7) Arrears of Maintenance and Steamboats nottaken over by the Admiralty.(8) Leap Year, 1916.(9) Damage by Bombardment or Aircraft.(10) Adjustment of Accounts.Arrears of Maintenance.Witness will refer to the document prepared by therailway companies and discussed at the Board ofTrade on tho 14th October, 1914, in which this ques-tion was first officially raised.He will refer to the opinion expressed at thatmeeting by Sir William Plender.Witness will quote from a letter written to theBoard of Trade on the 27th October, 1914, pointingout that in view of the various kinds of work beingundertaken for the Government, necessitating thepostponement of renewal and repair Avork, it wouldbe necessary to include in the railway companies&apos;claim against the Government a sum to cover thecost of deferred work.Witness will refer to subsequent discussions leadingto the clause in the Blue Book in which the Govern-ment admit their liability on this point.Witness will quote the Railway Executive Com-mittee&apos;s letter to the Board of Trade of 16th January,1915, setting out their understanding of this clause,and the Treasury letter, dated 10th February, 1915,accepting their view.Witness will then proceed to detail the negotiationswith the War Office in connection with an extendedand more systematic use being made of the railwaycompanies&apos; shops for munition work, which led tomonthly payments being made on account of arrears.He will quote from a memorandum dated 8thApril, 1915, submitted to the War Office, and willrefer to the steps taken to increase the manufactureof munitions by the railwawy companies, and to afurther memorandum dated 20th May, 1915, pre-pared at the request of Lord Kitchener, dealing withthe financial questions involved in the extendedmanufacture of munitions by railway companies.Witness will refer to the discussion at the Boardof Trade on this matter on the 18th June, 1915,when the Treasury representatives  agreed  to  thesuggestions for payments on account contained in thememorandum of 20th May, 1915, subject to furtherinformation being supplied justifying the proposedaddition of 12J per cent, to pre-war costs.Witness will refer to the steps taken by theGovernment to satisfy themselves as to the reason-ableness of the proposals of the railway companiesbefore Treasury sanction, first, as regards rollingstock (Abstract B), and secondly, as regardspermanent way, signals, telegraphs, &amp;c, (AbstractA), was given. .Witness will refer to tho issue of the agreedarrangements in tho printed document dated 25thJanuary, 1916, known as the Yellow Book.Witness will next proceed to explain shortly theprinciples underlying the agreed formula) which areset out in the Yellow Book.Witness will state that these formulas were onlyagreed for tho period up to the end of 1915, and willrefer to tho suggestion that a higher percentageaddition, in place of the 12J per cent., should befixed for the year 1916.Ho will refer (1) to the memorandum handed totho Treasury on 17th December, 1915, (2) to themeeting with the Treasury on the 29th March, 1916,(3) to the letter written by the Railway ExecutiveCommittee to the Board of Trade on 23rd January,1917, suggesting an addition to pre-war costs of 33i\per cent, in respect of arrears accruing in 1916, and(4) to a letter written by witness to Sir WilliamMarwood on 3rd April, 1917.He will then proceed to explain the difficultiesoutlined in the last-mentioned letter, which at thisstage led the railway companies to suggest that in-stead of a fixed percentage over pre-war costs, thepayments made periodically should be treated as pay-ments on account, and a final settlement be made atthe end of control.Witness will refer to further discussions on thismatter with the Government Accountants, theTreasury Officials, and the Board of Trade, whichultimately resulted in the Board of Trade letter tothe Treasury of 3rd May, 1917, and (after a meetingon the 19th June, 1917, between the RailwayExecutive Committee and officials of the Treasuryand Board of Trade) to the acceptance in principleby the Government of the railway proposals, and topayments on account being made on the basis of 115per cent, of pre-war cost.Witness will refer to a letter from the Board ofTrade to the Railway Executive Committee dated13th June, 1918, dating back the new percentage of115 to the commencement of control.Witness will refer shortly to arrears of maintenanceoutside the arrangement come to for payments onaccount, and will explain the position in the case of(a) steamboats and (b) other items of expenditureoutside Abstracts A and B.Financial and Accountancy work of the RailwayExecutive Committee.Witness will proceed to detail the financial andaccountancy work undertaken by the RailwayExecutive Committee (a) on behalf of the railwaycompanies, (b) on behalf of the Government, and willexplain the origin, constitution and main functionsof (1) a Joint Committee of general managers1 andaccountants (called at its inception the &quot; SpecialCommittee &quot; and afterwards the CompensationAccounts Sub-committee); (2) the Committee ofAccountants; (3) the Committee of Investigators.He will refer, in dealing with the duties of theCompensation&apos; Accounts Committee, to the actiontaken by them early in 1916 in the case of companieswhose expenditure on maintenance of way and worksand rolling stock considerably exceeded the corre-sponding expenditure in 1913.Witness will then explain the organisation set up,and the duties of these Committees, under the follow-ing general headings:  (a) the preparation of in-structions for the guidance of railway companiesand (b) the supervision of the compensation accountsof the companies.(a) Witness will refer to the discussions and nego-tiations with the Government representatives whichtook place in October and November, 1915, and
which resulted in March, 1915, in the issue of theBlue Book.He will then briefly refer to the emergency in-structions issued on the advice of the Accountants&apos;Committee and subsequently embodied in the BlueBook, and will shortly explain the steps taken bythe Accountants&apos; Committee in connection with theissue of the subsequent printed instructions, and thereasons why and the extent to which the successiveissues differed from previous instructions.Witness will then discuss the question how farinstructions issued by the Railway Executive Com-mittee on matters of accountancy were and are bind-ing upon the railway companies.He will refer to the alternatives which were openwhen the August, 1914, Agreement was made, andwill give his reasons for thinking that the coursepursued was the right one.(b) Witness will refer to the observations of SirWilliam Plender in his memorandum of 29th Sep-tember, 1914, and will refer to the proposal madelater to set up a small committee to scrutinise Com-pensation Accounts. He will also refer to the deci-sion of the Railway Executive Committee on 14thDecember, 1914, to appoint a sub-committee of in-vestigators, and will detail the steps taken by theRailway Executive Committee to obtain the assentof the controlled railway companies to this additionalaccountancy check.Witness will quote from a circular letter sent outto the railway companies on the 13th January, 1915,announcing the procedure for investigation whichhad been accepted at a meeting of General Managersof all the controlled companies.Witness will refer to the instructions given to hi-vestigators, and will also produce, if required, a setof questions which were drawn up by theAccountants&apos; Committee in order to direct theenquiries of the investigators to the moreimportant points.Witness at this stage will explain in summary formthe functions and procedure of the three committeesin dealing with the examination of claims againstthe Government.He will also explain how far it came within thefunction of these committees to give decisions orexpress opinions on the merits of any point indispute.Witness will comment on the heavy burden under-taken by the members of these committees, and alsothe anomalous position in which their duties placedthem.He will also refer to the procedure adopted at therequest of the Minister of Transport after the pass-ing of the Ministry of Transport Act, and to thecriticisms passed upon the railways in the Press andelsewhere with reference to the supervision of railwayaccounts, and in other directions.In concluding the main part of his proof witnesswill refer to the steps taken by the Governmentaccountants and by the Treasury to secure that therailway accounts were properly compiled by devisinga stringent form of certificate to be signed by aprofessional accountant.He will also quote from a letter dated 1st June,1915, from the Board of Trade to the Railway Execu-tice Committee, in which are recorded the arrange-ments made by or on behalf of the Governmentfor a thorough oversight of and check upon thepreparation of the companies&apos; accounts so far asthese affected the claims against the Government.Witness will then proceed to deal specifically withthe points referred to in the notes handed to SirHerbert Walker and himself on the 15th December,1920, so far as they are not covered by what hasalready been stated, under the following heads:  I.

&quot;... 518Memorandum with reference to the Financial Arrangements between the Governmentand the Railways.Preliminary Statement by Witness (SirAlexander Butterworth).Witness will say that he is the General Manager ofthe North Eastern Railway, and has held that positionsince 1906.That he was a member of the Railway ExecutiveCommittee from its inception.Witness at the outset will refer to the letter of the10th November, 1920, from Sir Herbert Walker tothe Secretary of Lord Colwyn&apos;s Committee, in whichhe stated that he had had an opportunity of consult-ing those General Managers who were his colleagueson the Railway Executive Committee (seven out ofthe original twelve), and that after carefully con-sidering the request that he should give evidencebefore the Committee, as Acting Chairman of theRailway Executive Committee, they were uiiaui-mously of opinion that it would be improper for anyone of them to take this action, in view of what theyunderstood to be the scope of the enquiry to be heldby the Committee and of the fact that the agreementsin question affected the rights of individual com-panies and might be the subject of litigation.He will say that in view of the fact that in thePress it had been freely stated (without any referenceto the terms of this letter) that the General Managershad refused to assist the Committee, he would liketo explain that the only thing that made the GeneralManagers reluctant to appear before the Committeewas the fear that, having regard to their terms ofreference, a witness might be placed in a positionwhich would lay him open to the charge of havingprejudiced the position of companies on whose behalfhe had no right to speak.Witness wishes to make it clear that he is notappearing before the Committee in order to presentthe views of the former Railway Executive Com-mittee, still less the views of the railway companiesin general, only twelve of which were represented onthat Committee.The general managers understand that what theCommittee chiefly desire to hear from them is auaccount of the circumstances which led up to thevarious agreements or arrangements and regulationsentered into or issued during the war with referenceto the Government control of railways on the financialside, and as witness was actively concerned in nego-tiating or framing a number of these, he has beenrequested to give the information asked for.Witness on his own behalf wishes to make it clearto the members of the Committee that he is desirousof rendering them all the assistance in his power.He realises that it may not always he easy, if one isto speak with the freedom and frankness that isdesirable, to avoid at times giving utterance to ex-pressions of opinion, or at any rate disclosing orimplying views, as to the position between the partiesor the ideas and intentions underlying transactions.But if this should prove to be the case, he desiresit to be very clearly understood that, so far as anyexpression or implication of views is concerned, herepresents no one but himself (not even his owncompany, and still less his former colleagues on theRailway Executive Committee), and he comes beforethe Committee on the distinct understanding thatnone of the companies will be prejudiced in any wayby anything that he may say in the course of hisevidence.The Formation of the Railway Executive Com-mittee and the Negotiations leading up to theAgreement as to Compensation.On the 31st July, 1914, when the outbreak of warwas imminent, the Committee held a meeting atwhich a memorandum, handed to the Acting Chair-man by Sir William Marwood (then Mr. Marwood),was read, embodying the proposal of the Governmentfor dealing with tho question of compensation tothe railways, if the Act of 1871 were put into force.Tho memorandum reads as follows:  &quot; To ascertain the compensation payable the&quot; aggregate net receipts of all the railways taken&quot; over during tho period for which they are&quot; taken over shall be compared with a similar&quot; aggregate for the corresponding period of the&quot; previous year (query average of three previous&quot; years). The ascertained deficiency, if any, less&quot; any amount of such deficiency which is attri-&quot; butable to causes other than the operation of&quot; the Act, shall be the amount of compensation&quot; duo. Any question as to the amount of the&quot; deficiency attributable to causes other than&quot; the operation of the Act shall, in default of&quot; agreement between the Board of Trade and&quot; the Executive Committee, bo determined by&quot; the (Railway and Canal Commission1).&quot;&quot; The sum paid in compensation together with&quot; the net receipts of the railways taken over&quot; shall be distributed among the railway com-&quot; panies in proportion to the net receipts of&quot; each company during the period with which&quot; comparison is made.&quot;&quot; Tho above agreement to apply to all the&quot; railways represented on the Executive Com-&quot; mittee, which will use its good offices to induce&quot; other companies to adhere thereto, especially&quot; those which it may be of importance to take&quot; over under the Act.&quot;It will be observed that in this document, asthroughout the negotiations, the Board of Trade andthe Executive Committee are treated as the twonegotiating parties on behalf of the Government andthe railway companies respectively,  though it isrecognised that the Executive Committee had nopower to bind the companies.After discussion the Committee decided to submitthe following memorandum to the Board of Trade:  &apos;&apos; The Executive Committee understand that&quot; in the event of a national emergency it has&quot; been decided that all the railways in Great&quot; Britain will be taken over by the Government.&quot; The Executive Committee recommend that at&quot;the time the railways are taken over, all the&quot; dock properties belonging to the railway com-&quot; panies should also bo taken over. Cn the&quot; understanding that this will be done the Execu-&quot;tive Committee consider that the question of&quot; the pooling of receipts does not arise, inas-&quot; much as the Act of 1871 provides all necessary&quot; machinery for adjusting any questions of com-&quot; pehsation between His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;and all or any of the railway companies.&quot;&quot; In the view of the Executive Committee the&quot; revenue of the railway companies whose rail-&quot; ways are taken over will belong to the Govern-&quot; merit.&quot;&quot;Any apprehension that an individual com-&quot; pany may obtain an advantage through the&quot; transfer of traffic consequent upon the exer-&quot; cise of the powers of the Act, would appear,&quot; therefore, to be without foundation.&quot;This shows that, at any rate at this juncture, itwas not the railway companies, but the Government,who were anxious for an agreement based on a poolof net receipts and a Government guarantee.  Therewas nothing in the Act of 1871 that gave the Govern-ment the right to set off a gain to one companyagainst a loss to another, and there can be littledoubt that the power to do this (in effect, thoughnot in terms) was one of the main objects of theGovernment in pressing for an agreement on thelines suggested by them.Indeed, when one considers the provisions of andprocedure under that Act, and the need under it ofdealing separately with each company whose railway
was taken over, one can see (apart from the greatoperating advantages which a pool of not receiptswould insure) the attraction to the Government of anarrangement of this sort one form of agreement onidentical lines for all companies, and a simple for-mula disposing once and for all of what was pro-bably the most important, as well as the most diffi-cult of ascertainment, of all the various items ofcompensation which, in default of agreement, mighthave to be assessed.Later on the same day (July 31st, 1914) threemembers of the Committee saw Sir William Marwoodwith reference to the memorandum quoted above, andwere informed that the Law Officers took a differentview from that expressed in the memorandum, andhad informed the Board of Trade that it would henecessary for an agreement to be made with therailways as to the disposal of the receipts.On the 3rd August, 1914 (Monday), the ExecutiveCommittee agreed to submit to the Board of Trademe following memorandum us the basis of anagreement between the railways and the Government,and to intimate that if it were approved, they woulduse their good offices to induce all companies whosesystems were taken over to adhere to it:  &quot; To ascertain the compensation payable, the&quot; aggregate net receipts of all the railways taken&quot; over during the period for which they are&quot; taken over shall be compared with a similar&quot; aggregate for the corresponding period of the&quot; previous year. The ascertained deficiency shall&quot; be the amount of the compensation due. Any&quot; question as to the amount of the deficiency&quot; shall, in default of agreement, be determined&quot; by the Railway and Canal Commission.&quot;&quot; The sum so payable as compensation to-&quot; gether with the net receipts of the railways&quot; taken  over shall  be  distributed among the&quot; railway companies in proportion to the net&quot; receipts of each company during the period&quot; with which comparison is made.&quot;The language of this Memorandum followed exactlythat of the proposals of the Board of Trade save forthe important omission of any reference to deficiency&quot; attributable to causes other than the operation ofthe Act,&quot;  words which apart from the principleinvolved would have been certain to lead to endlessquestious and disputes.  The reference to an averageof. threo years, and the words &quot; if any,&quot; are alsoomitted.On the 4th August, 1914, the question of com-pensation was again discussed by the Committee,and a Sub-Committee of four members was deputedto prepare a memorandum, giving the views of theCommittee and the reasons uO be urged upon theGovernment to induce them to accept the recom-mendation made on the 3rd August, 1914. Amemorandum was prepared the same day, and theSub-Committee were requested to present and explainit to the Board of Trade officials on the followingmorning (August 5th).In this memorandum emphasis was laid on thedesirability of an understanding in advance as tofinancial arrangements. It was suggested that theessentials of any agreement were that it should befair to both sides, simple in effect and economicalin its results, so far as wras consistent with efficiency,and it was intimated that in the view of the Com-mittee the only practicable arrangement, whichcombined these essentials, was a guarantee to thecompanies of their normal net receipts. It waspointed out that such an arrangement was usualin other countries in times of emergency; thatalthough certain traffics might be adversely affectedoi- destroyed by ihc war, the emergency itself wouldcreate new traffic and further, that such an arrange-ment would obviate elaborate accounting, and soeffect economy.On the 6th August, 1914, Sir William Marwoodintimated that the Government would be preparedto accept the proposal of the Committee, subject tothe following proviso:  &quot;Provided that if the aggregate net receipts&quot; for the first half of the year 1914 are less than&quot; the aggregate net receipts for the first half of&quot; the year 1913, the ascertained deficiency shall&quot; be reduced in the like proportion &quot;and on the same day, by letter to the Board of Trade,tho Executive Committee intimated that they wouldrecommend the companies to accept the arrangementso modified. (The effect of the proviso, added by theBoard of Trade on the 6th August, and its subsequentcancellation, are dealt with later on.)On the 3th August, 1914, an official letter wasissued by the Railway Executivo Committee to alltho controlled railway companies, in which the Com-initteo based their recommendation of the acceptanceof the proposed agreement upon:  (1) The advantage to the nation from, a workingpoint of view, because the Executive Com-mittee would be able to exercise their func-tions with a single eye to the efficient workingof the railways without having to considerthe possible effect of any particular schemeof working upon the interests of individualcompanies.(2) The rendering unnecessary the preparation ofelaborate accounts and returns and cotnpli-cated arbitrations.In the meantime the formation of the ExecutivoCommittee and the fact that the control of the rail-ways had been vested in it had been publiclyannounced (&quot; Times,&quot; August 5th, 1914), and a letter,dated midnight 4/5th August, 1914, had been sentby the War Office to each railway company, notifyingthem of the Order in Council and the taking over therailways under the Act of 1871. The letter said,&quot; You will carry on as usual, subject to the instruc-tions of the Executive Committee,&quot; thus clearlynotifying to the companies the authority of the Rail-way Executive Committee.It was evident that an arrangement of the sortcome to would offer opportunities to a company tospend money extravagantly or to improve its plantat the expense of the Government, and some of theGovernment officials were apprehensive that thismight be done.This appears from a letter dated 9th August, 1914,from the Railway Executive Committee to the Boardof Trade:-&quot; Dear Sin,&quot; We understand from the statements you&quot; made to us to-day that there is some appre-&quot; hension on the part of the advisers of the&quot; Government that advantage may be taken by&quot; some companies of the settlement provisionally&quot; come to with tho Government as to the basis&quot;of compensation under Section 16 of the&quot; Regulation of Forces Act, 1871, to spend&quot; abnormal sums out of revenue on the main-&quot; tenance and renewal of their lines and stock.&quot; I have to say that while&apos;the Executive Com-&quot; mittee cannot believe that any company would&quot; be capable of acting in such a manner, they&quot; have from the first regarded it as an obligation&quot; of honour to protect the Government against&quot; the possibility of such an event, and they had&quot; before your visit already taken steps to safer&quot; guard the position of the Government in this&quot; respect.&quot;&quot; Yours faithfully,&quot; (Sgd.)  H. A. Walker,&quot; The President, &quot; Acting Chairman.&quot;&quot; Board of Trade.&quot;The Railway Executive Committee were fully aliveto the point, although they were confident that actionof this character would be very exceptional, if itoccurred at all, and in their Circular Letter ofAugust 8th, 1914, they had adverted to the point.They foresaw, however, that some supervision andco-ordination of accounting methods would have tobe established, and on the 9th August, 1914, they setup a Sub-committee of Accountants to consider andreport upon the accountancy arrangements and in-struotions, which the carrying out of the agreementwith the Government would call for, recognising thatit would be most difficult, if not indeed wholly im-possible, for the Board of Trade or the Treasury to
check the accounts and regulate the financial opora-tions of the railway companies (so far as theseaffected the. Government) without assistance fromthem. In short, to use a phrase in vogue at thetime, the Railway Executive Committee decided toconstitute themselves the &quot; Watch-dogs &quot; of theGovernment, and promised the Board of Trade thatthey would so act, though strictly this was no partof their duties.Indeed, in all that passed before the war or duringthe negotiations which culminated in the agreementof 6th August, 1914, no hint had been given thatthe Government looked to the railway companies forassistance in matters of accountancy, and of coursethere was nothing in the Act of 1871 to cast anysuch duties upon them,One ot the first acts of the Committee ofAccountants was to draft emergency instructions(which were sent out to the companies on the 19thAugust, 1914), explaining the line to ho drawn, asregards revenue and expenditure, between itemsarising before or after 5th August, 1914, paymentsto families of Reservists and Territorials, etc., etc.(This was the first set of accountancy instructionssent out under the authority of tho RailwayExecutive Committee; the whole question of suchinstructions, their authority and force, is discussedlater.)Tho setting up of this Committee of Accountantswas no doubt one of the steps referred to in SirHerbert Walker\s letter of 9th August, 1914.Probably another was the preparation of a furtherletter to the companies, which was circulated on the13th August, 1914, and in which the whole subjectof the spirit and intention of the agreement and theobligations which would be cast upon the companies,was dealt with at considerable length.The following are extracts from the letter :&quot; It is hardly necessary to point out that the&quot; arrangement is one which, in spite of its great&quot; convenience both to themselves and the com-&quot; panics, the Government could not have agreed&quot; to, had they not been assured of the absolute&quot; good faith of the companies, and had they not&quot; felt certain that they could rely on all officers&quot; of the companies concerned acting loyally up&quot; to the spirit of the arrangement.&quot; Broadly speaking, the idea underlying the&quot; arrangement is that the financial results to&quot; each company for the period of Government&quot;control shall be the same as if the railways&quot; had remained under the control of the com-&quot; panies and the receipts and expenses of each&quot; railway had been the same as they were in&quot; the corresponding period of the previous year,&quot; subject to a deduction proportionate to any&quot; falling off in net receipts disclosed by the&quot; accounts of the companies as a whole for the&quot;first  half-year  of   1914.  The result is that&quot; during the period of Government control the&quot; advantage of all economies will enure to the&quot; benefit   of   the   Government,   and,   corre-&quot; spondingly, the whole burden of expenditure&quot; will fall on them.&quot;&quot; This state of things obviously imposes an&quot; honourable obligation upon the companies to.&quot; see that all proper economies are made, and&quot; that no abnormal or unnecessary expenditure&quot; is incurred.&quot;*******&quot; Again, it may be found that certain trains&quot; have become unnecessary or have ceased to be&quot; remunerative. In these cases the Government&quot; will naturally expect each company to reduce&quot; its train service from time to time, so far as&quot; it can reasonably do so.&quot;*     *     *     *     *     *     * -&quot;. Then, again, questions may arise as to the&quot; amount to be expended on the maintenance&apos;&quot; and renewal of way and works or rolling stock.&quot; Under these heads it will not be open to a&quot; company to include in its working expenses&quot; any greater sum than is required to maintain&quot; its works and plant in an efficient condition,&apos;&apos; including due allowance for renewals; and if&quot; the expenditure of any company upon any item&quot; of   maintenance  exceeds  the  corresponding&quot; figure in the previous year, the Government&quot; will no doubt, in the absence of special justifi-&quot; cation, expect it to be shown that the addi-&quot; tional expenditure was rendered necessary by&quot;their  requirements,  or by the exceptional&quot; character or quantity of the traffic carried&quot; during  tho  period  of  Government  control.&quot; This point has been definitely raised by the&quot; Treasury, and tho Executive Committee have&quot; had no hesitation in giving an assurance, onbehalf of all the companies taken over, that&quot; no unfair advantage will be taken of the&quot; present   situation   in   connection   with   the&quot; renewal of works or plant.&quot;Reference may here be suitably made to the effortsmade by the Railway Executive Committee through-out the war to keep down expenses as far as practi-eable with the object of reducing to the utmostpossible extent tho burden on tho nation of theGovernment guarantee.As an illustration may be quoted the CircularLetter of 17th September, 1914, advising thereduction of train services, both passenger and goods,to meet decrease in traffic and saying &quot; the obliga-&quot; tions of tbe Executive Committee to the Govern-&quot; merit make it necessary that every effort should&quot;be made to curtail working expenses.&quot;In subsequent instructions directions were issuedextending this policy to economies in other direc-tions, c.f/.-(i) in the user of coal, stationery andtimber (in some cases admittedly owing to nationalshortage); (ii) by the stoppage of canvassing andadvertising; (iii) by placing limitations on pas-sengers&apos; luggage, slowing down trains and othereconomies in working; (iv) taking steps to reduce theamount of clerical work.In many of these decisions the Railway ExecutiveCommittee were, in addition to reducing workingexpenses, actuated by a desire to liberate men formilitary serviceAs confirming the foregoing, attention may-bedrawn to paragraph 98 of the Third Report (1918)of the Select Committee on National Expenditure(C.D. 59), which says:-&quot; Since the companies  are secured against&quot; loss, no matter what their expenditure may be,&quot; and since their management remains in tho&quot; hands of their former officials, there is an&quot; obvious danger of relaxation of control, and of&quot; a consequent increase of costs.   Our sub-coin-&quot; mittee, which has been investigating this sub-&quot; ject, has made careful enquiry into this aspect&quot; of the matter so far as relates to Great Britain.&quot; It has found no reason to conclude that such&quot; results have occurred.   The causes which con-&quot; tinue to make for economical management are,&quot; first, the desire of the directors, the managers&quot; and their staffs, as good citizens, to protect&quot; tbe public interest by preventing extravagance&quot; from which the taxpayer would suffer; and,&quot;secondly, the prospect that after the Avar the&quot; effects of any laxity of control Avould continue.&quot; Whether the railways reverted to private man-&quot; agoment and the shareholders suffered the lo6s,&quot; or Avhether they remained in the hands of the&quot; State, the officials Avho had been to blame for&quot; Avaste Avould be held responsible, and their&quot; future would be prejudiced.&quot;On the 13th September, 1914, the Executive Com-mittee notified the Board of Trade that all the com-panies taken OA&apos;er had signified their acceptance ofthe Agreement, and the Board of Trade took thoopportunity to make a public announcement in thePress as to the terms of the Agreement betAveen theGovernment and the railway companies.Definition of the, term &quot; Net Receipts &quot; andPeriodical Payments on Account,It will be noticed that although the Agreementprovided for the ascertainment of the amount ofcompensation due and the manner of its distributionamong the railway companies, nothing Avas said eitheras to what &quot; Receipts &quot; should be included in the
arrangements or as to when payment was to bemadeEarly in the control period, partly in view of thecompanies not being paid for special work (outsideconveyance) done for Government Departments, andpartly because the cash receipts of some companieswere very much reduced, with the result that theyhad to apply to their bankers for an overdraft (forthe Government were making no payments for theconveyance of military and naval traffic), the quos-tion arose of approaching the Government as to find-ing the necessary money to pay current expensesand meet bank interest.The two questions, viz.: the definition of netreceipts and the date of payment of compensation,were closely connected, because much turned uponwhether &quot; general interest,&quot; which forms a head of&quot; Miscellaneous Receipts,&quot; was to be included in theGovernment guarantee,A Committee of four general managers wasappointed (21st and 26th August, 1914) to considerthe matter, who, in consultation with the railwayaccountants, prepared a memorandum and report i&apos;nwhich they recommended (1) the exclusion of mis-cellaneous receipts from the guarantee and (2) pay-ments on account by the Government at fairly 6hortintervals, an arrangement which they thought wouldafford a satisfactory solution of the interest question,both as between the Government and the companiesand as regards the companies inter se.The Committee&apos;s report was submitted to theRailway Executive Committee on 31st August, 1914,and they were requested to arrange a meeting withthe Government.Previously to this, as appears from a letter (21stAugust, 1914) from the Board of Trade to theTreasury (set out on page 7 of the White Paper),the former had, as a result of representations fromthe Scottish railway companies, recommended to theTreasury that the companies should receive periodicalpayments on account. (Three months was sug-gested.)The meeting with the representatives of theGovernment was held on the 8th September, 1914,when Sir William Plender made a proposal on thesame lines as that recommended by the Committee,with the result that the Board of Trade, after com-municating with the Treasury, wrote to theExecutive Committee on the 12th October, 1914, tothe effect that, as proposed by the Railway ExecutiveCommittee, net receipts should, for the purpose ofthe agreement, &quot; be taken to mean the net receiptscovered by the first seven items in Account No. 8of the first schedule to the 1911 Act, and that &apos; mis-cellaneous receipts (net) &apos; should not be included.&quot;The views of the Treasury are set out in a letterdated 9th October, 1914, from Sir Thomas Heath tothe Board of Trade.In the same letter (12th October, 1914) it wasintimated that the Treasury were prepared to makemonthly payments in full of the estimated Govern-ment liability under the agreement, &quot; subject to re-consideration after the 31st March next, and to therebeing from time to time money available out of thosums placed at the disposal of the Treasury byParliament.&quot;These arrangements were communicated to thecompanies by the Railway Executive Committee (15thOctober, 1914) in a letter which spoke of the &quot; greatadvantage of monthly payments &quot; being sufficient tojustify the companies in accepting the definition ofnet receipts desired by the Government.There seems to have been a little confusion as to theparentage of the suggestion that &quot; Net Receipts &quot;should be limited to the first seven items of AccountNo. 8, because the letter of the Board of Trade (12thOctober, 1914) speaks of the definition as a proposalof the Railway Executive Committee.The point is not very material. The first idea ofthe railway companies seems to have been that thewhole of the items in Account No. 8 should beincluded, but this would have involved some specialarrangement with regard to interest, because a&quot; credit &quot; for interest is treated in railway accountsas an item of receipt, going to make up the netrevenue, while a &quot; debit &quot; is not brought into theaccounts till a later stage-that is, it is treated as adeduction from or payment out of net revenue.There seems no doubt that the definition agreed onwas thought the simplest at the time, and it savedthe Government from the risk of loss, which thecorrespondence shows was apprehended, through aguarantee of interest; on the other hand it had thodisadvantage of creating a diversity of interestbetween the Government and the companies in anymatter where questions of interest were involved.Apart from the question of interest, the inclusionof some of the items of revenue outside railwaysproper, c.g., hotels, steamboats, etc., was distinctlyadvantageous to the Government. In tho case ofsteamboats the result in effect was that the Govern-ment obtained the use of the railway fleet, represent-ing a capital expenditure of some  7,000,000, for anannual net payment to the companies of about 150,000. If tho companies had not agreed to theirsteamboats being treated as falling within the pro-visions of the Act of 1871, and tho revenue derivedfrom them brought into the agreement, they wouldpresumably have received, for such of their vesselsas were taken over by the Admiralty, charter moneyon the same lines as was paid to shipping companiesand private owners, and it has been roughly com-puted that this would have involved a payment by thoGovernment of more than  1,000,000 a year.Extension of Compensation Agreement to 1915.Before the year 1914 was out it became necessaryto consider the position as regards the year 1915.When the agreement with the Government wasmade, probably neither party contemplated the con-tingency of its being extended beyond the year 1914;at any rate, the wording of the agreement was notappropriate or free from ambiguity, if applied tothe year 1915. Before the end of 1914, however, itbecame clear that provision had to be made for amuch longer period than had originally been in con-templation.The question of asking the Government to agreeto some basis of arrangement as from January 1st,1.915, was therefore referred by the Railway ExecutiveCommittee to a sub-committee to consider and report.On receipt of the sub-committee&apos;s report it wasdecided that it was desirable that (1) A  final settlement   should  be  made  of theaccounts up to the end of 1914.(2) Tho agreement should bo applied to the year1915 as if the year 1913 were &quot; the previousyear.&quot;(3) The &quot; proviso&quot; should be dropped as from thecommencement of 1915.A meeting was held with the President of theBoard of Trade on the 19th January, 1915, whenpoints (1) and (2) were agreed, and this was con-firmed by Treasury letter of 9th March, 1915.As regards the proviso, the President asked forparticulars of traffic, and this point was not con-ceded until three months later (April, 1915) when,arising out of the war bonus to railwaymen, a modi-fied agreement, to operate as from the 1st January,1915, was arrived at.The history of this matter is as follows:  At the end of 1914 or beginning of 1915 the rail-waymen raised the question of an increase in wpgesin consequence of (a) the increase in cost of living,and (b) the abnormally high wages being paid formunitions work. Discussions took place at severalmeetings of the Railway Executive Committee andin February, 1915, some of the general managers,representing 26 companies, met representatives ofthe railway unions, and agreed to pay the first warbonus (2s. or 3s. per week according to whether aman&apos;s standard rate did or did not exceed 30s. aweek) on and from the week commencing February15th, 1915. Other companies negotiated a similarsettlement independently. The bonus was limited to&quot;men in the Conciliation Scheme grades, and did notextend to either shopmen or clerks.Tho question as to how the war bonus should botreated in the working expenses of the railways, i.e.,whether it should be borne by the Government or bythe companies, was discussed with the Board ofTrade by Sir Guy Granet in February  1915, the
view of the Government being that the cost of thebonus should be borne by tho companies, on theground that a similar advance might have had tobe paid apart altogether from the war and Govern-ment control, in other words, that it was beingpaid, at any rate in part, in respect of overdueadvances of wages. Ou the other hand, the viewheld by the companies was that the whole amountof the bonus should be borne by the Government,on the ground that tho bonus was due to the abnormalconditions caused by the war, just as much as theincreases in tho prices of materials, and that theoriginal bargain clearly covered any increase inworking expenses. On tho 17th February, 1915, aletter was written to the Board of Trade by theRailway Executive Committee protesting against theview which the Government was understood to hold.The view of the Government seemed to them incon-sistent with the elimination of the words in theGovernments original memorandum of agreement,which the Railway Executive Committee stipulatedfor as an essential part of the compensation arrange-ment.   (Ante p. 2.)Shortly before this, as above-mentioned, viz., atthe meeting at tho Board of Trade on the 19thJanuary, 1915, the Railway Executive Committeehad asked the Government that the &quot; proviso &quot;should cease to operate.It will be remembered that the &quot; proviso &quot; was astipulation which tho Board of Trade pressed for inAugust, 1914, the suggestion being that the accountsof the railway companies for the first half-year of1914 showed a drop in receipts, indicating fallingtraffics, and that it was a fair inference that, apartfrom any war, the revenue of 1914 would probablyhave been less than that of 1913.The Railway Executive Committee, though theyhad accepted the proviso, and to that limited extentmay be said to have admitted the argument of theGovernment, had never been satisfied of its fairness.It was based on surmise, it worked unequally betweendifferent companies (e.g., the net receipts of manycompanies were higher in 1914 than in 1913), andthe arguments on which it was based seemed todisappear altogether when the war traffics exceededall anticipations, and the bargain of 1914, withoutany proviso, proved to be unexpectedly favourableto the Government.The figures were as follows:   January to June 1913 (net receipts) ...   20,266,0441914   ,,      ,,        ...   19,533,543 732,501__the  732,501 which is equal to 3-614425 per cent, of 20,266,044, being made up of:- Decreases       ......  817,559Increases        ......    85,058 732,501and the effect of the proviso being that the deficit,for which the Government were responsible, becamesubject to a reduction at the rate of 3-614425 per cent.The arrangement discussed and finally agreed to inApril, 1915, was in the nature of a compromise, theGovernment conceding the railway companies&apos; pointas to the proviso and the Railway Executive Com-nrittee agreeing to pay part of the war bonus. Theactual terms were as follows:  (1) The companies to agree to bear 25 per cent,&apos;.   of the bonus allowance to men in the ConciliationScheme as defined by the agreement signed on13th February, 1915.. (2) The Government to agree to treat as anormal item in working expenses any otheradvances granted to other classes of railwayemployees.(3) The Government to agree to abolish theproviso as from 1st January, 1915, that is tosay, that the net receipts for the year 1913 with-out reduction should constitute the basis ofcomparison for the purpose of compensation.Witness is able to say from his own knowledgethat the Railway Executive Committee did theirutmost in this matter to meet the views of the Govern-ment; they felt strongly that the bonus was beyondall doubt a legitimate item in working expeuses, butthey recognised that the question of war bonus, whichwas then a new one, had a political side, which theGovernment could not afford to ignore, and thoughthey thought that, in all the circumstances, the&quot; proviso &quot; might very well have been dropped onmerits, they fell in with the suggested compromiseafter no little searchings of heart.The agreed terms were submitted to and acceptedby all the controlled companies, and the agreementcome to in August, 1914, so modified and amplifiedby the arrangements subsequently made with theGovernment on various matters hereinafter referredto in detail, is still being acted upon.That this agreement worked favourably to the Stateis assumed to be generally recognised both by theGovernment and independent authorities. For thepurposes of record reference may be made to thofollowing:  ((() Paragraph 97 of the Third Report of the SelectCommittee on National Expenditure (1918)(CD. 59) says:&quot; Had prices not risen, and had wages&quot; remained stationary during the war, the&quot; State would have made an excellent bar-&quot; gain in securing the free carriage of all&quot; its traffic, oven apart from the advantage&quot; of controlling the railways, including the&quot; steamers belonging to the companies, in&quot; return for a guarantee of the pre-war net&quot; receipts. Even as things are, there is&quot; reason to believe that, if that traffic had&quot;to be separately charged, the sums payable&quot; by the State would probably be greater&quot; rather than less than those now paid.&quot;(b) In the debate on the Ministry of TransportBill in the House of Lords (Hansard, Houseof Lords Debates, vol. 35, p. 988), on 23rdJuly, 1919, the Earl of Lytton said:&quot; What the noble Lord has pointed out&quot; to-day is perfectly true, that down to this&quot; year the Government did not make a bad&quot; bargain. With the Government traffic that&quot; was carried free, the guarantee of the net&quot; receipts of 1913 was not at all a bad&quot; arrangement for the Government. The&quot; difficulty has arisen only in this year from&quot; two causes partly the great increase in&quot; the cost of working the railways, as of&quot; working everything else, largely due to the&quot; increased cost of labour, and partly to the&quot; falling off in the Government traffic.&quot;(c) The results of the working of the&apos; railways duringthe control period, up to the end of the year1918, as shown in the statement issued bythe Ministry of Transport, dated 31st Octo-ber, 1919 (Cmd. 402).The Supplementary Clauses to the GeneralAgreement are contained in a printeddocument (Pink Book) circulated withCircular Letter 729, dated 14th November,1916.The Treasury assent to these Clauses was given onthe understanding that the companies accepted theTreasury interpretation of the main agreement(namely, that the military and naval traffic was notto be charged for), and that a complete and satisfac-tory arrangement was arrived at in connection withthe question of the charges to be raised for servicesof all kinds rendered by the railway companies tothe Government.When the agreement . of 6th August, 1914, wasmade, nothing was said, and no provision wasinserted in the memorandum embodying thearrangement, with reference to the disposition ofany surplus. It was assumed on both sides that therailway accounts must show a deficit throughout thewar, and the only thing that seemed necessary wasto provide for that contingency, namely, by aGovernment guarantee, and obviously a guarantee
does not have tho effect, in tho absence of expressstipulation, of transferring the income or receipts oftho guaranteed party to the guarantor.Neither did tho agreement contain any expressprovision on tho subject of charges on Governmenttraffic. There again the assumption of a continuingdeficit made the point appear to be immaterial andacademic, but of course if there were any chance ofthe deficit being turned into a surplus, it became amatter of prime importance whether the understand&quot;ing that charges would not be raised in respect ofGovernment (Le., military and naval) traffic, wasfounded on mere considerations of book-keeping orwas an integral part of the bargain under which acertain revenue was guaranteed to the companies.Was the minimum which was guaranteed to themintended to be also a maximumP If so, it waspossible to conceive circumstances in which tho Statewould got its forces and munitions of war carried,not merely at cost price, but without payment ofany sort.In the summer of 1915 various requests by Govern-ment Departments that the cost of services performedby railway companies might bo charged againstrailway working expenses were under discussion, andon 23rd July, 1915, a meeting was held at the Boardof Trade to discuss these requests, when tho matterwas deferred for further consideration in view of thequestions of principle involved.On the 1st September, 1915, Sir William Marwoodwroto to the Railway Executive Committee on the(piestion of charges for services rendered to the Gov-ornment, stating that the Treasury regarded the freecarriage of men and stores for Naval and Militarypurposes as an essential part of tho agreement withthe companies, and that the right of the Govern-ment to these free services and the consequent relieffrom tho necessity of keeping accounts was whatmainly induced them to enter into the agreement ofAugust 6th, 19.14,This was not the view of the Railway ExecutiveCommittee, and the point was not then conceded bythe companies.It so happened that about the same time ques-tions had arisen which pointed to the need of ampli-fying tho extremely concise agreement of 6th August,1914, and the Railway Executive Committee wereturning their minds to tho question whether itwould not bo well to approach the Government onthe subject of revising or supplementing the originalterms, especially in view of tho growing certaintythat the war, and therefore the period of Govern-ment control, was going to be a long one. Amongstother subjects tho position of tho companies, andthe responsibility of the Government, with regard todamage from air raids had for some time been underdiscussion; again it was obvious that if- the periodof control were to be greatly prolonged, some ar-rangement must be come to with regard to furthercapital expenditure.On the 2nd November, 1915, four of the generalmanagers, met Sir Thomas Heath and Sir John Brad-bury, when a general indication was given of wdiatthe railway companies had in mind, and the RailwayExecutive Committee were asked to tabulate thevarious points which it was desired to bring up forrevision.A memorandum was prepared, which was handedto the Treasury on the 17th December, 1915, and onthe 4th January, 1916, a further meeting was heldwith Sir Thomas Heath and Sir John Bradbury, atwhich they agreed in principle with the fairness ofthe companies&apos; claim for revision of the agreement,but asked for some information as to the amount ofmoney involved.Approximate estimates were supplied in a letterfrom Sir Alexander Butterworth to Sir Thomas Heathon the 13th January, 1916.The Treasury then referred the matter to thoGovernment accountants, and on the 31st January,1916, the Compensation Accounts Committee had ameeting with those gentlemen (Sir William Plenderand Mr. Gurney Fowler) at which the points raisedin the memorandum supplied to the Treasury woreconsidered in detail.At a further meeting with Sir Thomas Heath andSir John Bradbury at tho Treasury on the 29thMarch, 1916, they explained the manner in whichthey wore prepared to advise tho Chancellor of thoExchequer to deal with the six points raised in therailway companies&apos; memorandum.The result of this meeting is set out in a letterfrom Sir Alexander Butterworth to Sir HerbertWalker, dated 30th March, 1916, which was approvedby Sir Thomas Heath and Sir John Bradbury asbeing a correct record of the meeting.The Treasury authorities subsequently approvedCircular Letter 655 (which was issued to the com-panies for their information and approval prior tothe preparation of the printed document) and thedraft supplementary clauses accompanying that letter,and after all companies had agreed to accept the newclauses (two companies dissented for a time) thoclauses were issued in book form (Pink Book).The Clauses in question arc six in number anddealt with the following subjects, viz. :(1) Capital Expenditure.(2) Stores.(3) Allowances to Dependants of Service men.(4) Damage by Air Raids.(5) Charges for services to Government.(6) Adjustment of accounts.These are not identical with the six points referredto in the explanatory memorandum prepared by thoRailway Executive Committee, which were asfollows :-(1) Capital Expenditure.(2) Stores.   -(3) The Proviso.(4) Inclusion of 100 per cent, of War Bonus inWorking Expenses.(5) Charges for renewal of Permanent Way andRolling Stock.(6) Allowances to Dependants of Service Men.For convenience of reference these latter points,as well as the other matters dealt with in the Clauses,are shortly explained below:-1. Capital Expenditure.Owing to the expectation that the period of controlwould bo short, no provision had been made foradditional capital expenditure. This was consideredunfair to the companies, as the Government weregetting the benefit of capital expenditure which wasnot yielding a return in 1913.The Railway Executive Committee ,proposed thatinterest should bo allowed by the Government oncapital expended on works, etc., brought into usesince December 31st, 1912.The principle of this proposal was admitted by theTreasury to be fair; 4 per cent, was agreed to bea moderate rate of interest, and tho matter wasincluded in the Supplementary Clauses (No. 1).It will be convenient as a matter of history torefer at this point to the circumstances in which thorate of interest was changed from 4 per cent to5 per cent.In the latter part of 1918 the attention of theRailway Executive Committee was called by certaincompanies to the financial difficulties in carryingout the necessary capital works, and on tho 7th May,1919, a letter was addressed by Sir Herbert Walkerto the Acting President of the Board of Trade on thesubject, in which reference was made to the expendi-ture required in connection with (a) New sidings and railways or alterations askedfor by firms and others in order to enablethem to increase their premises and output.(b) Schemes   of   alteration   necessary  to   enableeconomies in working to be effected by thorailway companies,(o) Alterations, widenings, rebuilding of stations,provision of rolling stock, etc., necessary toenable tho railway companies to adequatelydeal with the normal increase in traffic.And the difficulties arising out of:  (a) The inadequate amount allowed for interest oncapital works brought into use, i.e., 4 percent.(b) The fact that no interest is allowed until the -works are brought into use.
(c) The heavy increased cost for carrying out thework ut existing rates of wages and pricesof material.(fZ) The uncertainty as to how the railway com-panios will be recouped for such expenditurein the case of the Government deciding totake over the railways.On the 30th May, 1919, the Board of Trade wrotein reply convoying Treasury sanction to the followingarrangement:  (1) &quot; That in place of the present arrangementsbetween  the  railway   companies. and  theGovernment with regard to the rate of inter-est to be allowed on new capital expenditure,interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annumfrom the date on which the expenditure isincurred  may   be   allowed   in   respect  ofapproved capital expenditure.(2.) &quot; That an assurance may be given to the coui-panies that in the event of their under-takings being acquired by the Governmentthe companies shall neither be financiallyprejudiced  nor financially  advantaged  byreason of having incurred capital expendi-turo under the present arrangements.&quot;The letter enclosed one from the Treasury, dated23rd May, 1919, which said:  &quot; I am to request you to inform the Board ofTrade that in view of the considerable fundspossessed by the railway companies, My Lordssee no reason for providing for the expenditureon new works and rolling stock by advances fromGovernment Funds.     They recognise that theinterest obtained upon present investments may,in many cases, be in excess of 4 per cent., andthey are accordingly prepared to concur in therate of interest allowed on capital expenditureon new works or additional rolling stock afterthe 1st instant being raised to 5 per cent., suchinterest to begin to accrue as from the datewhen the capital expenditure is incurred.&quot;These two communications were discussed by theCompensation Accounts Committee, and after one ortwo points of doubt had been cleared up with theTreasury,  Circular  Letter  No.   1930,   dated  15thAugust, 1919, was issued by the Railway ExecutiveCommittee advising the companies of the generalterms of the arrangement.On 7th November, 1919, a Circular Letter, No.2001, was issued setting out the procedure to befollowed for obtaining the approval of the Govern-ment to new works.Later, a question arose as to the overlapping of thetwo arrangements, i.e., (1) the allowance of 4 percent, upon new works generally from the date ofcompletion and (2) the allowance of 5 per cent, uponapproved works as and when the expenditure wasincurred, and this was dealt with by the Ministry ofTransport.Detailed regulations in regard to the compilationof claims for 5 per cent, interest were also agreedwith the Minister of Transport and issued to the com-pnnies with Circular Letter S. 104, dated August12th, 1920.2. Stores.The main agreement was silent as to the methodof charging for material taken from the stocks ofthe companies during the period of control, and itwould have been open to the companies to retain onhand the stocks of stores existing at the outbreakof war. The companies, having given the Govern-nient the benefit of their stocks bought before thewar at pre-war prices, ran the risk of finding them-sclves burdened with stocks bought at inflated prices.The point was one which clearly called for safe-guarding, and in the absence of express provisionthere might be disputes at the end of control asto what had been the intention of the parties.The Railway Executive Committee suggested thatthe,best way would be for the Government to putthe companies (by cash payment) at the. end ofcontrol in the same position as regards stocks ofstores as they wore in at the beginning.This was considered by the Government and theiradvisers to be reasonable in principle, and theproposal of the Railway Executive Committee, witha slight modification, was embodied in the Supple-mentary Clauses (No. 2).3.-The Proviso (August-December, 1914).As already stated, the &quot; proviso &quot; was added bythe Board of Trade to the proposal of the RailwayExecutive Committee in August, 1914, on the groundthat, apart from the war and Government control,there was every probability that the net receiptsin 1914 would be less than in 1913 The provisohad been dropped as from 1st January, 1915, inconnection with the arrangements as to war bonus(ante p. 5) but the Railway Executive Committeecontended that the proviso would never have beensuggested had there been any anticipation of theenormous traffic that was passing, and they asked,therefore, when discussing the question of surplusreceipts, that it should bo treated as never havingexisted, and that the accounts August to December,.1914, should be adjusted accordingly (sec noxt item).4. War lionus.They also contended that there was no justificationfor excluding from the working expenses of thecompanies any part of the war bonuses concededby the Government to the railwaymen, and askedthat they should cease to bear the 25 per cent, ofthe original war bonus as arranged.The Government were not prepared to concedethese two points, in view of the definite bargain cometo in April, 1915, above referred to (ante p. 5).No doubt the Railway Executive Committee inthis instance were asking the Government to relievethe companies from an agreement entered into twelvemonths previously, but it is only fair to state thatthere, had been an acute difference in .opinionbetween the members of the Railway Executive Com-mittee at the time as to the propriety of the com-panies agreeing to bear any part of the war bonus,and the retrospective cancellation of the proviso forthe period August December, 1914, though involv-ing but a small sum of money, and, therefore, seeni-ingly hardly worth asking for, was thought to be avery legitimate concession to seek, if the companieswere to abandon all claim to surplus receipts.b.-Rcnewal of Permanent Way and Boiling Stock.It was pointed out that the present regulationsworked hardly on &quot; non-programme &quot; companies, andit was, therefore, suggested that companies shouldbe alloAved to charge for renewals as much as theyincluded in their 1913 accounts, irrespective of actualexpenditure, and that in connection with suchcharges additions to rolling stock or mileage of linesshould be allowed for.Under the regulations, as they stood, a &quot;non-programme &quot; company (i.e., a company that hadnot been in the habit of basing its renewals uponany fixed formula) could include nothiug in its work-ing expenses against the Government for renewals,unless it had actually carried out renewals in theyear under review, and then only to the extent ofthe work earned out.This suggestion was approved, and the regulationswere altered accordingly (C.L. 686).Opportunity was taken at the same time to clearup certain ambiguities in the wording of this part ofthe regulations; this is referred to more in detaillater (pp. 20 and 21).6. Allowances to Dependants.A limit of 10s. per week had been fixed as the maxi-mum allowance to the dependants of Service menchargeable against the Government. Tho companieshad undertaken in all cases to bring the separationallowances up to four-fifths of salary or wage, andthis in many cases exceeded 10s. a week.It was agreed that the limit of 10s. should be can-celled, and this was included in the SupplementaryClauses (No. 3).Other matters which were discuoiod at the sauiatime were:
7. Arrears of Maintenance of Steamboats not takenover by the Admiralty.It was agreed that this should bo dealt with atthe end of control.8.-Leap Year, 1916The companies considered that they were entitledto a proportionate addition for the additional dayin the year 1916, but the Government were notwilling to concede this point, and tho RailwayExecutive Committee did not press it.9. Damage by Bombardment or Aircraft.The Government agreed to bear the cost of rein-statement of property &quot; above the line,&quot; regardlessof the date of reinstatement, but not of property&quot; below the line.&quot; This arrangement was embodiedin the Supplementary Clauses (No. 4).10. Adjustment of Accounts.In addition to the foregoing, Clause 6 (Adjustmentof Accounts) provided as follows:  &quot; Every company to give an undertaking to&quot; repay  to  the  Treasury  or  to  any  person&quot; nominated by them any sums which ou a final&quot; settlement of the accounts of any period ending&quot; 31st December may be found to have been&quot; received or retained by such company in excess&quot;of the amounts due to them, together with&quot; interest at the rate of 5 per cent, to run&quot; from the 1st March following the close of any&quot; such period.&quot;Inasmuch as the companies made up their ownclaims it was only fair that where items had beenincluded in the claims paid by the Government andsubsequently disallowed, such sums should be re-funded, and also that interest should be paid on theamount, seeing that a long interval often occurredbetween the last monthly payment in respect ofany year and the final settlement of the claim.This matter had been under consideration in theearly months of 1916, when it was brought to thenotice of the Railway Executive Committee thatthe expenditure of many companies in 1915 uponmaintenance of way and works and rolling stockconsiderably exceeded the corresponding expenditurein 1913.The whole question of surplus receipts was practi-cally disposed of by annexing a schedule to the clauses(see Clause 5), which set out a list of services andstated how the charges for each class of service shouldbe dealt with; it was provided that there should beno cash payments in respect of the conveyance oftroops, or of military and naval stores, etc.Aeeears of Maintenance.At the beginning of control no special considerationwas given to arrears of maintenance, as at that timefew people realised how long the war was likely tolast, and so far from people anticipating a difficultyin getting work done, there was a general appre-hension of unemployment.When, however, the Government agreed to pay-ments being made monthly on account of compensa-tion, and instructions were drawn up and issued tothe companies as to the manner in which the state-ments showing the liability of the Government shouldbe made up, the question of arrears was raised.Obviously any estimates of the Governments liabilityunder the agreement Would have been misleading thattook no account of arrears of maintenance.A document headed &quot; Summary of Recommenda-&quot; tions upon certain matters requiring settlement in&quot; connection with compensation to bo paid by the&quot; Government in respect of the period of Control,&quot;which was prepared by the railway companies anddiscussed with the Board of Trade and Treasury onthe 14th October, 1914, contains the following refer-ence to the subject:  &quot;14. Having regard to the large amount of&quot; work which is being done for the Government&quot; in the construction of road vehicles, ambulance&quot; trains, stretchers, etc., and the diminution of- &quot; the staff employed in the repairs of way, works&quot; and rolling stock, etc., by those who have&quot; joined the Colours, and to the large number of&quot; permanent way men engaged in watching and&quot; patrolling the line, it is probable that the up-&quot; keep of the works and equipment of the com-&quot; panies may be considerably in arrear at the&quot; end of the period of control. As this arrear of&quot; work must be performed by the companies&quot; after the termination of the period of control,&quot;it is suggested that the Government may&quot; reasonably be asked to sanction a charge to&quot; the revenue of the control period on that&quot; account.&quot;The notes of this meeting show that Sir WilliamMarwood presided, and that representatives of theTreasury and Sir William Blender were also presentun behalf of the Government, whilst the railway com-panies were represented by members of the &quot; SpecialCommittee.&quot;Sir William Plender &quot; indicated in regard to No. 14&quot; (Arrears of work during Control period) that in his&quot; view the proposal was quite reasonable, and that&quot; any claim made under this head should be con-&quot; sidered on its merits.&quot;Following this meeting the Railway Executive Com-mittee on 27th October, 1914, decided, in view ofthe fact that various kinds of work were beingundertaken by tho companies for the Government intheir workshops, and that ordinary railway mainten-anco would suffer thereby, to write to the Board ofTrade giving details of such work.In the letter (27th October, 1914) they pointed outthat &quot; such work necessarily involves the postpone-&quot; nient of the usual renewal and repair work which&quot; would otherwise have been carried out to the&quot; various railway companies&apos; plant, the cost of which&quot; would, under the agreement come to with the&quot; Government, have been included in the expenses&quot; incurred during the period of Government control.&quot;The letter went on to say, &quot; we think it shouid be&quot; made clear that the railway companies may sooner&quot; or later have to include in their claim against the&quot; Government a sum to cover the cost of the work&quot; which is deferred and which will have to be over-&quot; taken.&quot;Further discussions took place, mainly between SirWilliam Plender and the railway accountants, and,ultimately, a paragraph dealing with the matter wasinserted in the instructions which, with the approvalof the Treasury, were issued to the companies in1915 (Blue Book), the final wording of the paragraphrelating to Arrears being suggested by the Treasuryin their sanctioning letter, dated 1st January, 1915,as follows:  &quot; In the event of the companies being of&quot; opinion that arrears of normal maintenance&quot;work have arisen during the control period,&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken to&quot; consider on their merits any representations&quot; submitted to them; and, if necessary, a state-&quot; ment should be prepared at the end of the&quot; control period of any liabilities of this nature&quot; not included in the accounts prepared cur-&quot; rently. (No such statement will be required&quot; in cases where provision is made for mainten-&quot; ance by carrying definite sums to a special&quot; fund iu anticipation of actual expenditure.)&quot;In acknowledging this letter to the Board of Tradeon January 16th, 1915, the Railway Executive Com-mittee say:  &quot;They are prepared to accept the. form of&quot; words suggested by the Treasury in substitu-&quot; tion of Clause 4 (e) (Arrears of Maintenance&quot; Work).&quot; In view, however, of the importance of the&quot; point, and of the generality of the language&quot; used to express the undertaking of the Gov-&quot; eminent, they think it right to place on record&quot; their understanding that, in this clause, the&quot; Government admit the principle that, if in&quot; the special circumstances obtaining during the&quot; period of control, a railway company has to&quot; postpone works of maintenance (i.c, the re-&quot; pairs and renewals of its works and plant)&quot; which in the ordinary course would have been&quot; executed within the period and their cost&quot; charged as working expenses, the cost of such
&quot; works, when they come to be executed, is a&quot; fair  charge   against   the   Government.   The&quot; Railway Executive Committee feel bound to&quot; emphasise this point because without a distinct&quot; understanding with regard to it, they would&quot; not feel justified in advising companies, as they&quot; have been doing, to undertake the manufacture&quot; of  the  very  numerous  articles  of military&quot; equipment which are being made in the shops&quot; of many of the companies, work which is ob-&quot; viously outside the ordinary functions of a&quot; railway company, and the execution of whioh&quot; must necessarily interfere seriously with the&quot; upkeep of the companies&apos; undertakings.&quot;Tho Treasury in a letter ,to the Board of Trade,dated 10th February, 1915, accepted this view of theunderstanding, and formal confirmation was sent bythe Board of Trade to the Railway Executive Com-mittee on the 13th February, 1915..   It will thus be seen that the earliest arrangementin regard to arrears of maintenance and renewalwork, which, though it was not limited to any par-ticular class of works or plant, had its origin mainlyin the fact that the railways were undertaking workfor the Government other than railway work proper,provided for the preparation of claims under thishead at the end of tho control period.   It was not,however, long before that was superseded by anarrangement under which monthly payments weremade on account, while the fact that companies wereundertaking various forms of munitions work wasfound to be only one of many causes, all contributingto the accumulation of arrears.From the first the railway companies were probablyin a position tp claim current payments under thearrangements already in operation, on the groundthat they were entitled to make provision in theiraccounts for unexecuted works of renewal and repairand to charge the same as part of their workingexpenses, apart from any special agreement underthis head, seeing that there can be no proper ascer-tainment of &quot; Net receipts &quot; until proper provisionha&amp; been made for outstanding liabilities of all kinds.As bearing upon this point, reference may bemade to Sir William Prouder&apos;s observations in theMemorandum submitted to the meeting on the 14thOctober, 1914, to the effect that &quot; in setting up&quot; reserves for depreciation or provisions for main-&quot; terrance of locomotives, carriages and wagons,&quot; permanent way, bridges, stations, etc,&quot; should&quot; follow strictly the methods &quot; adopted in 1913, andit may be assumed to havo been the general practiceof companies to make provision out of currentrevenue for works of maintenance which circurn-stances prevented their executing at the time.However, the point was one of such magnitudethat it was obviously desirable to havo a clearunderstanding about it, and to agree upon a definiteprocedure, which should be fair to both sides.Accordingly, during the year 1915 negotiationstook place with the Government, which were con-ducted less upon any arguments of legal technicalitythan upon broad brounds of equity and convenience,and which resulted in an arrangement under whichmonthly payments on account were to be made tothe companies in respect of certain &quot; arrears of&quot; maintenance&quot; outside and apart from theirmonthly compensation payments.The successive stages of the negotiations may betraced as follows :  In April, 1915, the Railway Executive Committeesuggested to the War Office the national benefit tobe derived from fuller and more systematic use beingmade of railway companies&apos; shops for munitions work.One of the points to which attention was drawnwas that if this were done, it would result in alarge increase in the arrears of maintenance ofrolling stock, and it was pointed out that in thatcase it would not be practicable to adhere to theexisting understanding, under which the settlementof all claims under this head was to be deferred untilthe termination of control.The question was dealt with in a Memorandumdated the &apos;8th April, 1915, prepared by the RailwayExecutive Committee for the Secretary of State forWar, paragraph 2 of which is as follows:  &quot; (2) The Government should definitely assume&quot; liability for arrears of maintenance work by&quot; tho companies.  It is obvious that if railway&quot; companies are to carry out their transport work&quot;efficiently it will be impossible to postpone re-&quot; pairs indefintely.  Indeed, some repars, e.y.,. &quot; running repairs,  must be carried out cur-&quot; rently, but at the same time, it is anticipated&quot; that, for a certain period at any rate, com-&quot; panies as a whole can safely postpone a por-&quot; tion of their repairs and employ the staff&apos; in&quot; manufacturing for  the  Government  in the&quot; railway shops.  If, under these circumstances,&quot; the railway companies manufacture for the&quot; Government on a large scale, it is certain that&quot; the arrears of maintenance will be serious.&quot; Tho Treasury has already admitted tire prin-&quot; ciple that arrears of maintenance form a legiti-&quot; mate head of claim against the Government,&quot; but it is not proposed to deal with such claims&quot; until tho end of the poriod of control.  This&quot; will not be a practicable way of meeting the&quot;situation if manufacturing for the War Office&quot;is to tako place on a largo scale.  It would&quot; mean a number of very complicated arbitra-&quot; tions, and the position would be intolerable to&quot; the Government and companies alike.&quot;This   memorandum   was   submitted   to   LordKitchener, and Sir Herbert Walker had air interviewwith him on the subject.  Tho Government at thattime were very much concerned at the shortage ofmunitions, arrd Lord Kitchener asked the RailwayExecutive Committee to take steps at once to organisethe manufacture of munitions of war by the railwaycompanies to the fullest extent, but requested theCommittee to supply him with a separate ineino-randum dealing with the financial questions arisingout of the manufacture on a large scale of rnuni-tiorrs of war by railway companies.The railway companies at once decided to under-take the additional work, and for that purposestrengthened the War Manufactures Subcommittee,which had been appointed as far back as -November,1914, and Avhich under the chairmanship of the lateSir Guy Calthrop (afterwards Coal Controller) hadsupervised the manufacture of munitions by railwaycompanies up to that date.In accordance with tho request made by LordKitchener, a further memorandum upon the financialquestions involved was sent to him on the 20th May,1915.   .....The memorandum dealt with the three questions,viz.:  1. The charge to be made by the companies formunitions work,2. The mode of payment.3. The effect of such work upon the ordinarymaintenance of the undertakings of thecompanies.It emphasised the point that the companies desiredno profit for themselves (a fact which enabled theGovernment to save large sums for the nation in themanufacture of shells and numerous other classes ofmunitions), but pointed out that tho shareholdersmust be safeguarded as regards arrears of rrrain-tenance.It is hardly necessary to point out that the nianu-facture of munitions was not work which the Govern-ment could have called upon the companies to carryout under any powers contained in the Act of 1871.It may be interesting to mention that the sumspaid to the railway companies for the manufactureof munitions, representing the cost price to fhern,amounted in the aggregate to over 17 million pounds.The direct saving to the nation thereby effected un-doubtedly amounted to a very substantial percentageon that sum.In addition to this the companies, at the instigationof the Railway Executive Committee, rendered veryvaluable assistance to the Government by sendingpermanent way, locomotives and wagons to France,and elsewhere abroad, services for which-very, generoustributes were paid to the companies and the Railway
Executive Committee both by the Coinmander-in-Chief and the present Minister of Transport.It was suggested in paragraph 5 of Part (3) of thomemorandum above mentioned that repairs and re-newals which were due to be carried out, but whichthe companies had not been able to execute, shouldbe charged at a uniform percentage above the amountexpended in 1913, and that 12^ per cent, would be afair addition to make to the 1913 figuies for theperiod up to the 31st December, 1915, the percentagebeing left open to review as from the latter date.The four most material paragraphs of this memo-randum were as follows:  &quot; 5. The Executive Committee, therefore, re-commend that, as regards both renewals andrepairs actually executed, either by the com-panies in their own shops or by contract, thework be charged in the ordinary way at currentprices, and that arrears of work, that is to say,the renewals and repairs which are duo to bocarried out, but which the companies have notbeen able to execute, be charged at a uniformpercentage above the amount expended in 1913.It is impossible to say what prices will prevail intho future, either as regards labour or materials,but it is suggested that 12$ per cent, would be afair addition to make to 1913 figures for theperiod up to December 31st, 1915, the figurebeing left open to review as from the latter date.&quot;&quot;6. If this suggestion be adopted, it will be&quot; necessary to prescribe the mode of arriving at&quot; the amount of arrears, but it is thought that&quot; there would be no difficulty in doing this upon&quot; the basis of the amounts expended on or de-&quot; bited to renewals and repairs -in 1913, and&quot;the control period respectively, after making. &quot; allowance for the difference in prices in the&quot;two periods, that is to say, the amount by&quot; which the expenditure in 1914 or 1915 fell&quot; short of the amount spent upon similar items&quot; in 1913, after the necessary adjustment of&quot; figures due to enhanced prices, would repre-&quot; sent the arrears or shortage of work in the&quot; control period. Allowance would also have tobe made for any increase that a particular&quot; company might be able to show in the quantity&quot; of its rolling stock or in the wear and tear to&quot;which such stock had been subjected during&quot;the period of control.&quot;7. In considering what percentage addition&quot; to the figures of 1913 would be fair, it must&quot; be borne in mind, not only that both prices&quot;and wages have gone up very much since 1913,&quot; but also that in the case of repairs, even with&quot; prices remaining constant, the postponement&quot; of work beyond the date when it properly falls&quot; due in itself involves additional cost. For one&quot; thing, arrears have to be caught up and work&quot; done under pressure, involving overtime, and&quot; other extra payments, but more serious still is&quot; the fact that the plant itself falls into a con-&quot; dition necessitating more extensive repairs&quot; than would have been required if the work&quot;had been taken in hand in ordinary course;&apos;&apos; the case is an exemplification of the old adage&quot; that a stitch in time saves nine.&quot; 8. These last considerations do not admit of&quot; any very accurate estimate, but there is no&quot; doubt that the money loss they represent is&quot; substantial, and, if the postponement were for&quot; a long period, would be very serious indeed.&quot;The matter was discussed at a meeting at theBoard of Trade on the 18th June, 1915, when theTreasury representatives who were present agreedgenerally to the suggestions contained in the memo-randum quoted above, but required some further in-formation to show how the figure of 12$ per cent,had been arrived at.The memorandum, though not in terms limited torolling stock, had been chiefly directed to the arrearsunder Abstract B. At the meeting on 18th June,1915, the repairs and renewal of permanent way,etc. (Abstract A), Avere referred to, and it was under-stood that the two classes of work (Abstracts A andR) should be dealt with on the same lines.Figures were supplied by the principal railwaycompanies, in regard to Abstract B, of actual costsin June, 1915, compared with 1913. These wereexamined by Mr. Gurney Fowler on behalf of theBoard of Trade, who stated in a letter to the Boardof Trade, dated 20th July, 1915, that after examiningfigures from nine principal railway companies, hewas &quot; of the opinion that the 12 $ per cent, asked for&quot; is justified as a fair charge up to the 31st&quot; December, 1915.&quot;The approval of the Treasury was in the firstinstance (letter dated 26th August, 1915) limited toarrears of maintenance and renewal of rolling stock(Abstract B), but later the Treasury in their letterto the Board of Trade of the 23rd September, 1915, acopy of which was forwarded to the RailwayExecutive Committee on the 24th September, 1915,extended their approval to permanent way, signals,telegraphs, etc.   (Abstract A.)The advice to the companies of the arrangementmade with the Government and instructions as to thoformulae to bo used in stating the claims against theGovernment are set out in a printed documentdated 25th January, 1916 (Yellow Book), issued totho companies with Circular Letter 483 of the samedate. This document was approved by the Boardof Trado letter dated 24th January, 1916, after ithad been considered in detail by Mr. Gurney Fowlerand Sir William Plender on behalf of the Board ofTrade.Stated shortly, the idea underlying these formulaswas that the companies should receive month bymonth the difference between (a) their expenditure during each month of controlon repairs and renewal of 1(i) permanent way and works (AbstractA), and(ii) rolling stock (Abstract B)(reduced to what it was estimated that theworks executed would have cost at theprices current in 1913); and(b) their expenditure on, or debit in respect of,the same items in the corresponding periodof 1913.The amounts so ascertained, which were to betaken as representing the shortage or arrears ofmaintenance expressed in terms of pre-war cost,were to be increased by 12$ per cent, (subsequentlyraised to 15 per cent.), this percentage addition, asalready stated, being intended to represent the thenhigher cost of wages and materials.The difference between present and pre-war costs,for the purpose of reducing the cost of the workscurrently executed to their pre-war value, was to beseparately arrived at for each company byascertaining the cost of the more important materialsand the rates of wages in 1913 and in each of thecontrol periods and so calculating a fair generalpercentage increase.It will be observed that the 12$ per cent, additionwas only agreed up to-the end of 1915. About thattime the question of a supplementary agreement inregard to interest on capital expenditure and othermatters had been raised, (ante p. 19) and in amemorandum submitted to the Railway ExecutiveCommittee on 1st December, 1915, dealing withthese questions, it was pointed out that since thearrangement fixing the 12$ per bent, had been made,costs had advanced very materially.In these circumstances it was suggested that a newfigure should be agreed for 1916.This memorandum, as previously mentioned, washanded to the Treasury on the 17,th December, 1915,and at the meeting of 29th March, 1916, (ante p.6) already referred to, the Treasury agreed that ahigher percentage should be allowed in respect ofthe year 1916.After an investigation into current costs, theRailway Executive Committee wrote to the Board ofTrade on 23rd January, 1917, suggesting 33$ percent, in place of 12$ per cent, in respect of arrearsaccruing in 1916.After giving further consideration to the matter itoccurred to the Railway Executive Committee thatif the war were to continue for several years, and
523costs were to continue to rise, the system of fixinga different percentage for the arrears of each yearwould bo extremely unsatisfactory.The objections to the system are summarised in aletter which is printed in the White Paper (page 46)dated 3rd April, 1917, from Sir Alexander Butter-worth to Sir William Marwood.Apart from practical difficulties that were likelyto arise in working out the arrangement, the sub-stance of the matter lay in this, that the relevantcosts were really those obtaining at the time whenthe arrears of work came to be executed, and anyarrangement that definitely fixed a percentage inadvance was in the nature of a gamble. Assumingthat costs went down after the war, the Governmentmight very easily be paying unduly high sums, iftheir liability was calculated upon the costs currentat the time when the arrears accrued. With ourpresent experience 33J per cent, sounds a verymoderate addition to pre-war costs, but at the timeit was looked upon as a very large one, and no onecould foretell whether costs Avould be higher or lowerwhen the work came to be carried out.The matter had been discussed in a preliminaryway at a meeting with the Government accountants,hold with reference to other subjects, on the 13thMarch, 1917, and it was discussed at a meeting ofthe Executive Committee on March 20th, 1917.Later, Sir Thomas Heath intimated that the matterwas one for the Board of Trade to deal with in thefirst instance and it was in consequence of thisintimation that the letter, of the 3rd April, 1917,to Sir William Marwood was written, which wasreferred by the Board of Trade to Sir Albert Wyon.Later in April, 1917, Sir Alexander Butterworthdiscussed tin matter with Sir William Marwood,when he explained that the proposal of the com-panies was that tho ultimate percentage should beagreed, or settled by some prompt and simple methodof arbitration, within at latest twelve months afterthe termination of the Government control.On the 3rd May, 1917, as appears from the letterprinted on page 45 of the White Paper, the Boardof Trade explained the whole situation to theTreasury, as a result of which, on the 19th June,1917, a meeting was held with representatives ofthe Treasury and Board of Trade; at that meeting,after discussion, the proposals of the Railway Execu-tive Committee were accepted in principle, leavingthe exact amount of the payments on account to besettled later.&apos;0n the 3rd July, 1917, a letter from the Treasury(dated 26th June, 1917), was forwarded to the Rail-way Executive Committee by the Board of Trade,agreeing to payments on account being made at therate of 115 per cent, of pre-war costs, and on the30th August the Railway Executive Committee wroteaccepting this figure.The result of these negotiations was that all pay-ments, including those made in respect of 1914 and1915, were to be treated as payments on account,the payments from 1st January, 1916, to be cal-culated at 115 per cent, of pre-war costs and at theend of control, or within 12 months afterwards, thecompanies were to receive the difference (if any)between the sums so paid to them and the cost(actual or estimated) of carrying out the work, suchdifference, in the absence of agreement, to be settledby some simple form of arbitration.For the purpose of simplification the 112^ per cent.,which had been agreed for 1914 and 1915, was sub-sequently altered to 115 per cent.As already explained, the above arrangements onlyapplied to works falling under Abstracts A and B,and did not extend to such things as traffic,machinery, docks and dock plant, hotels, steamships,etc., though all such items fell within the sameprinciple, which had received official recognition asfay back as the preparation of the accountancyinstructions in 1914.The case of steamboats was specially discussed withthe Treasury in December, 1915, and again in March,1915, and it was agreed that the amounts due forarrears of maintenance of steamboats should besettled at the conclusion of the period of control.The case of steamboats was rather special, becausea great number of tho railway steamers had beencommandeered by the Admiralty, who were, of course,liable for their maintenance.As regards items other than steamboats, the pointwas expressly raised in connection with the Supple-mentary Clauses in a letter from Sir Herbert Walkerto the Board of Trade, dated the 27th October,1916, and alter some correspondence in which theTreasury intimated their readiness, if necessary, toconsider tho extension to other abstracts of theprocedure already adopted in the case of AbstractsA and B, a letter was written by the Treasury tothe Board of Trado on the 23rd January, 1917, andforwarded to the Railway Executive Committee on30th January, 1917, in the following terms:  &quot;In reply to Mr. Moggridge&apos;s letter of 6th&quot; instant (It. 3655) I am directed by the Lords&quot; Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to&quot; request you to convey to the Board of Trade,&quot; for communication to tho Railway Executive&quot; Committee, Their Lordships&apos; assurance that&quot; They recognise that the railway companies&quot; will  have  a  claim  against  His  Majesty&apos;s&quot; Government at the end of the period of the&quot; war, or at the end of the period of control,&quot; in regard to arrears of maintenance in the&quot;case of works falling within the scope of the&quot; General Agreement and not included in any&quot; special arrangement now made or to bo made&quot; for the payment of deferred maintenance.&quot;The decision to let all payments in respect ofthese arrears stand over until after the control wasrather complained of by some of the companies whosedocks formed a large part of their undertaking, buton the whole the arrangement come to was thoughtto be fair and satisfactory, though it is possiblethat it was less favourable to some companies thanto others.Financial and Accountancy Work oe the RailwayExecutive Committee.The financial and accountancy work undertaken bythe Railway Executive Committee divides itself undertwo main heads :  (1) Work undertaken on behalf of the railwaycompanies;(2) Work undertaken on behalf of the Government;and this work was in the main performed by.:-(1) A Joint Committee of General Managers andAccountants, called at its inception theSpecial Committee, and afterwards theCompensation Accounts Sub-Committee.(2) A Committee of Accountants.(3) A Committee of Investigators.The first half of the work, viz., that on behalf&apos; ofthe companies, can be dismissed here with a fewwords. It was undertaken, for the most part, eitherby specially appointed Committees or by the JointCommittee of General Managers and Accountants,and consisted mainly of negotiating with the Gov-ernment on financial matters; it was strictly nopart of the duties of the Railway Executive Com-mittee as such, but as that Committee included theGeneral Managers of most of the leading companies,it seemed at the time the most suitable body toundertake this work. It is with the other half ofthe work that the section is concerned.The Executive Committee, either directly orthrough the Joint Committee or the Accountants&apos;Committee, acted also as a medium of communica-tion between the companies on the one hand &quot;andGovernment Departments and the Governmentaccountants on the other in relation to financialques-tions, with the advantage of securing uniformity ofaction.The Committee of Accountants acted as technicaladvisers of the Railway Executive Committee, andthe investigators acted, under the direction of theCommittee oi Accountants, in advising.the companiesin the preparation of their accounts, and in examin-ing claims made against the Government under theagreement..Turning now to the origin, constitution and mainfunctions of the three bodies to which, as above
stated, questions of finance and acountancy weremostly referred, these were shortly as follows:  1. The Compensation Accounts Sub-Committee.This Committee (at first called the Special Com.mittoe) originally consisted of two gonoral managersand five accountants, and was set up on the 10thSeptember, 1914, &quot; to tabulate suggestions for deal-&quot; ing with any points upon which it is considered&quot; difficulty may arise in the preparation of the final&quot; accounts to; be submitted to the Government for&quot; ascertaining the net deficiency payable to the&quot; various companies by the Government under the&quot; agreement.&quot; Alterations were made in the corn-position of the Committee from time to time, butit continued throughout to be a joint Committee ofgeneral managers and accountants.With the exception of one matter, viz1., the con-sideration of compensation claims, which will be re-ferred to at length later, the Committee merely dealtwith matters expressly referred to it; but as a rulesuch accountancy and financial matters as werethought to involve questions outside the scope of thefunctions of the Accountants&apos; Committee were re-ferred to it, and it generally fell to them to discusswith the Treasury and the Government Auditors anydifficult points arising in connection with accounts.Thus it represented the Railway Executive Committeeat the meetings (referred to on pages 8 and 13) withthe Board of Trade and Treasury on October 14th,1914, and November 25th, 1914.It also acted as a liaison body between theAccountants&apos; Committee and the Railway ExecutiveCommittee.As an illustration of the sort of assistance whichthrough the medium of this Committee the RailwayExecutive Committee endeavoured to render to theGovernment, reference may he made to the actiontaken by it in connection with the question of excessexpenditure referred to on page 8.In the early months of 1916 it was brought to thenotice of the Railway Executive Committee that theexpenditure of many companies in 1915 upon main-tenance of way and works and rolling stock con-siderably exceeded the corresponding expenditure in1913.In consequence of this all companies, whose accountsfOr 1915 disclosed an increase in their expenditureon Abstract A or B. (after adjustment for differencein costs) of more than 10 per cent, over the 1913figures were invited to meet the CompensationAccounts Committee. Meetings were held with 26companies, the company being in most cases repre-sented by its general manager. Their attention wasdrawn to the Circular Letter of the Railway ExecutiveCommittee, dated 13th August, 1914, and it waspointed out to them that the Government wouldalmost certainly call for an explanation Of any ox-penditure substantially in excess of that of 1913.The meetings brought to light a number of difficultand doubtful points, and in particular attention wasdrawn to the questions:(1) Whether it was necessary to continue the Gov-ernment control of all the railways; and&apos;(2) What steps should be taken to ensure the re-payment of any sums paid to or retained bycompanies in excess of the amountsultimately found to be due to them.As to the latter question, the Committee recom-mended that all companies should be asked to givean undertaking to refund with interest any amountswhich might be found to have been overpaid tothem, and to deposit security where a satisfactoryundertaking was not forthcoming, a recommendationwhich, as explained above, was partially embodiedin the Supplementary Clauses.The Compensation Accounts Committee made areport of the meetings to the Railway Executive-Committee, in which they stated that they believed-that itt the case of the companies not closely in touchwith &apos;the Work of  the Executive Committee themeetings had not been without use, and ;that in-every-case.&apos;&quot;where explanations&apos; or details were askediforthey had;been readily Supplied to the Committee.There was nothing in the agreement of 1914limiting the amount to be expended or the workto bo done by a company to what was spent orcarried out by it in 1913, and the Railway ExecutiveCommittee would have assumed a serious - re-sponsibility if they had prevented any company fromcarrying out repairs which that company considerednecessary for the safe or efficient conduct of its traffic.But they thought it their duty to play the role of&quot; watch-dogs &quot; to the best of their ability, and theymade it abundantly clear that any company whichwas considered to be over-stepping the line of whatwas fair would find no support from tho RailwayExecutive Committee. They had no power to bite,but they could at any rate bark.2. The Accountants&apos; Sub-Committeewas set up, as already mentioned, on 9th August,1914.   Its original functions wore to report:(1) &quot; What arrangements will have to be made&quot; and what instructions will  have   to   be&quot; issued to the various companies in order&quot; that a uniform system shall be adopted in&quot; arriving at tho net receipts for a given&quot; period in 1913, and of the expenditure&quot; and revenue of each company during the&quot; time the railways are taken over by the&quot; Government.&quot;(2) &quot; What  steps can  be  taken to enable  the&quot; Executive Committee to be kept advised&quot; periodically of the comparative expendi-&quot; ture that is being incurred during the&quot; time the railways are taken over by the&quot; Government,&quot;This Committee at first consisted of the; account-ants, of six companies, but oh the 14th August, 1914,it was enlarged to include the accountants of all thecompanies represented on the Railway Executive Coin-mittee.The Accountants&apos; Committee acted really in threecapacities: (1) in advising the Railway ExecutiveCommittee on matters of accounts and preparingstatements and estimates, etc. for them; (2) in assist-ing the Government, first in the preparation ofinstructions to the railway companies as to the wayof making up their accounts, and secondly in examin-ing the accounts and claims of the various companies,and, as part of this latter branch of their work, ininstructing and supervising the work of the Investi-gators; and (3) in distributing the money receivedfrom the Government between the separate coin-panics, in fact, acting as a clearing house in connec-tion with the money1: settlements under the com-pensation and subsidiary agreements.In carrying out (2) and (3) the Accountants&apos; Com-mittee is to be looked upon as a branch or Sub-Committee of the Railway Executive Committee.Their Minutes were submitted to the RailwayExecutive Committee for confirmation; the lettersand instructions which they prepared were sent outunder the signature of either the Secretary or theActing Chairman of the Railway Executive Com-mittee, and 16, Great George Street, where they heldtheir meetings and where their Secretary and clericalstaff had their offices, came to be regarded as theAccountancy Headquarters of ,the Railway ExecutivoCommittee, just as 35, Parliament Street, was thoCommittee&apos;s headquarters proper.$-Investigation Sub-Committee,The Investigators came into existence in March,1915; they never actually sat or acted as a Com-mittee, and it will be convenient to deal with thohistory of their organisation in connection with thedetailed account of the special work undertaken hythem.As already explained, the main duties undertakenby the Accountants&apos; Committee touj behalf of theGovernment were (a) the preparation of instructionsfor the guidance of the railway companies; (b) thesupervision of the compensation-accounts of the com-;p&apos;anies; and it will he convenient to.deal with theremainder of &quot;this Section, including the origin andfunctions&apos; of the&apos; Investigators, under these twoheadings.
A-The Phei-akation ov Instructions.The first step was to lay down the lines upon whichtho accounts of the companies should be made up forthe purpose of presenting their claims against theGovernment.Memoranda on this subject were prepared (1) bythe railway accountants on behalf of the RailwayExecutive Committee (being the memorandum alreadyreferred to in connection with arrears of mainten-ance) and (2) by Sir William Pleader on behalf ofthe Government, and these were discussed at thomeeting at the Board of Trade on the 14th October,1914, which, as already mentioned (ante, p. 8), SirWilliam Marwood, with Sir William Plender andrepresentatives of the Treasury, attended on behalfof the Government, whilst the Railway ExecutiveCommittee were represented by members of the JointCommittee already referred to.Those two memoranda formed the basis of the in-structions which early in 1915 wero sent to all con-trolled companies, setting out tho methods to boadopted in making up the &quot; compensation claims,&quot;as they came to be called, showing, in the case ofeach company, how each period compared with thecorresponding period of 1913, and the estimated doficitwhich the Government were liable to make good.The actual sequenco of events in this connection wasas follows:  After the meeting on October 14th, 1914, the rail-way accountants drafted a set of regulations based onthe memoranda which had been discussed at thatmeeting and the decisions then arrived at. Mean-while the Treasury officials were also trying theirhands at a draft.These drafts were discussed at a further meetingon 25th November, 1914, at which the same partieswere represented, when draft regulations were agreed.As a result of that meeting the regulations orinstructions so agreed wero provisionally issued bytho Railway Executive Committee on 13th January,1915, with a Circular Letter explaining the functionsof the Investigators; but tho instructions were notissued in final form until tho Government had form-ally signified their approval.This was not until March, 1915, when the instruc-tions wore sent out by the Railway Executive Com-mittee in book form (Blue Book), under tho title,&quot;Memorandum of Instructions to Railway Companies&quot; for the Preparation of tho Accounts to be presented&apos;&apos; by each Controlled Company to arrive at the amount&quot; of compensation payable by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-&quot; ment.&quot;The instructions wero accompanied by CircularLetter No. 214, dated 1st March, 1915, which statedin terms that the instructions were &quot; as finally&quot; approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government,&quot; andended &quot; You will now be in a position to complete&quot; tho final account in respect of tho period 5th&quot; August 31st December.&quot;These instructions set out the original agreementof August and the agreed definition of Net Receipts;embodied a number of the emergency instructionswhich had been issued in August, 1914; containeddetailed regulations as to tho inclusion and appor-tionment of various items of receipts and expenditure,as to provisions for reserves, etc., and laid it downthat the net receipts of each company for the year1913 must bo taken to be those appearing in thepublished accounts of that year.The respective methods adopted in 1913 by thevarious companies were to regulate tho accounts ofeach company during tho period of control.The following is a brief summary of the principalsets of accountancy regulations or instructions issuedbefore the passing of the Ministry of TransportAct, 1919:-R.E.C.

Circular letters dealing with preparation andform of monthly estimates of revenue receiptsand expenditure, and arrears of mainten-anco.2, Circular letters dealing with the accounting sideof questions previously settled by the Rail-Avay Executive Committee with the Govorn-ment Departments, e.g&apos;.f expenses of requisi-tioned steamboats, war bonus&apos;, Governmenttraffic, form of published accounts, procedurein regard to accounts for war manufactures,. etc. .3. Circular letters dealing with cessation of inter-company charges and divisions of traffic,non-controlled companies&apos; proportions, andother matters, which may be regarded&apos; asarising   automatically, from   Governmenti-.       control.How far the instructions issued by the RailwayExecutive Committee on matters of accountancy wereor are binding upon companies whioh did. not agreeto act upon them was occasionally discussed, but hasnever been decided. It may be taken that they havebeen generally worked to, but if and so far as theywent beyond what might be fairly regarded as impliedin. the main agreement, there seems to be nothingthat made or makes them binding upon a dissentientcompany, though it is doubtful whether this wasgenerally realised, especially by the smaller com-panies. It was obvious that an agreement concludedin such general language as that of August, 1914;would admit of considerable variations in details asregards the exact mode of carrying it out, and itS2046E 3
was desirable from all points of view to avoid con-stant doubts and disputes and to secure uniformityof action as far as possible.Two courses were open. One would have been toendeavour to draft an agreement in sufficient detailto cover all possible or probable contingencies, andthen negotiate the terms with each of the 80 or socontrolled companies in Great Britain, with thealmost certain result that the war would have endedbefore any agreement was arrived at with many ofthe companies. The other was the course actuallyadopted to draft fair regulations covering the mostimportant of the points likely to rise; supplementthese as and when it became necessary; issue theregulations, and assumo that they would meet withgeneral acceptance.If the Railway Executive Committee in suchmatters occasionally assumed an authority for whichthey might have found it difficult to give chapterand verse, this was undoubtedly to the publicinterest; what they felt mainly concerned with, wasthat the agreement should bo carried out in a fairspirit and upon reasonable and practical lines, andthat they should render all the assistance in theirpower to the Government.The rule, as already mentioned, was, in all mattersof principle, to obtain the approval of the Govern-ment Accountants and tho Government Departmentconcerned (Board of Trade and/or Treasury) to theinstructions before thoy were issued, so that at- anyrate the Government could not suffer by the pro-cedure adopted. Indeed, the procedure from thefirst was adopted with the acquiescence if not atthe express request of the Board of Trade, wholooked to the Railway Executive Committee and theAccountants of the railway companies for a muchlarger degree of assistance in accountancy mattersthan the General Managers had anticipated, or, sofar as appears, than the Government had any legalright to require.B. The Supervision op Compensation Accountsof the Companies.Sir William Plender seems to have assumed that therailway companies would takes some steps to securethat the different companies would make up theiraccounts upon a correct and uniform basis, for inhis memorandum of 29th September, 1914, he said  &quot; The Board of Trade, whilst reserving to itself&quot; the  right   of  nominating  any, independent&apos;  &quot; person or persons to examine on. their, behalf&quot; the accounts submitted, should be advised of&apos; the step6, if any, which the railway companies,&quot; on their own initiative, propose to take to&apos;&apos; prevent any possible misunderstanding of the&quot; regulations governing the preparation of the&quot; accounts which are to be embodied in the&quot; proposed memorandum, as by constituting a&quot; body of railway expert accountants selected&quot; mainly from the Railway Clearing House, who&quot; would, by personal examination of accounts&quot; and conference with officials, see that as far as&quot; possible uniformity in treatment is established,&quot; and that no departure from the instructions&quot; takes place.&quot;On the 8th December, 1914, a suggestion was madethat a 6mall committee should be formed to &quot; scru-tinise the accounts which will be presented by thevarious railway companies to form the basis of thecompensation payable by the Government,&quot; and thetask was remitted to the Joint Committee alreadyreferred to, which later came to be known as theCompensation Accounts Committee jAt. a meeting of this Committee, held on 14thDecember, 1914, it was recommended that a Sub-Committee of Investigators should be set up, con-sisting of two representatives from the accountantsoffice of each of the companies represented on theExecutive Committee.It was thought that in the first instance two mem-bers of such Sub-Committee should visit the account-ante of each of the &quot; non-executive &quot; companies, inorder to satisfy themselves that the Memorandum ofInstructions was clearly understood, and that laterthe members of the Sub-Committee should conductan investigation of each company&apos;s accounts in orderto ascertain that the instructions had been givenoffect to.The matter was next brought before the ExecutiveCommittee in order to obtain their approval to theformation of tho Sub-Committee suggested, andfinally was considered by a meeting of generalmanagers of all the controlled companies, held attho Railway Clearing House on the 18th December,1914, when it was resolved:  &quot; That   this   Conference   of   tho   General&quot; Managers of the companies, tho control of&quot; whoso lines has been taken over by the Goveru-&quot; meat under the Act of 1871, assents to. the&quot; principle of an audit of the accounts to be&quot; rendered on behalf of the &apos; controlled &apos; com-&quot; panics to tho Government, by a Committee to&quot; bo appointed from the staffs of the accountants&quot; and audit offices of the companies represented&quot; on tho Accountants&apos; Committoo of the Execu-&quot; tivo Committee, and agrees to afford overy&quot; facility for such audit.&quot;Following the decision of the general managersrecorded above, the Compensation Accounts Com-mittee met the proposed Committee of Investigationat the Railway Cloaring House on the 6th January,1915.At that meeting the minutes of the generalmanagers&apos; conference referred to above were read,and it was pointed out that the proposed arrange-ments would bo to the mutual advantage of all thecompanies, since, by enabling tho Railway Execu-tivo Committee to give the Government an assurancethat the approved instructions had been fully under-stood by all companies and that the claims for com-pensation had been prepared on tin- lines there laiddown, the final settlement would be greatlyfacilitated.On the recommendation of the same Committee,held on the 12th January, 1915, it was decided thatthe memorandum of instructions (Blue Book), whichwas on the point of being issued to the companies,should be accompanied by a circular ietter, explainingthe steps which were being taken. The following isan extract from the letter, which was sent out ontho 13th January, 1915:  &quot;With reference to the meeting cf general&quot; managers of controlled companies, held at the&quot; Railway Clearing House on the 18 th December&quot; last, when assent was given to the proposal&quot; to constitute a Committee of Investigation,&quot; consisting of representatives of the accountants&quot; of the companies represented on ohe Executive&quot; Committee, in connection with the claim for&quot; compensation to bo rendered against the&quot; Government in respect of period of Govern-&quot; ment control; as indicated at that meeting,&quot; the duties of the Committee will, in the first&quot; instance, be of an advisory character in con-&quot; nection with the Memorandum of Instructions&quot; which, at the instance of the Government, is&quot;to be issued in regard to the accounting&quot; arrangements during the period of Govern-&quot; ment control.&quot;********&apos;&apos; I have also to advise you that at an early&quot; mutually convenient date two representatives&quot; of the [ : &apos;       ] Company will call upon&quot; your accountant&apos; for the purpose of giving any&quot; explanations that may be necessaij to ensure&quot; a complete understanding as to the intention&quot; and effect of the various instructions.&quot;On 3rd March,: 1915, instructions outlining theduties of the Investigators were drawn up by theAccountants&apos; Committee, and a rota was prepared ofvisits to be made by the Committee of Investigationfor the purpose of examining the accounts of all thecontrolled companies for the period 5th August to31 st December, 1914.These instructions provided:  &quot; General.&quot; To ascertain whether the provisions of the&quot; Memorandum of Instructions have been strictly&quot; complied with and to report any departures
&quot; therefrom. Any questions of principle that&quot; may be raised to be enquired into and reported&quot; upon.&quot; Basis of Compensation.y &quot; Particular attention to be given to Clauses&quot; (6) and (7) of the Memorandum.&quot; With regard to Clause (8), the Investigator&quot; to report in every case the method employed&quot; in arriving at the total traffic receipts for the&quot; period 5th to 31st August, 1913, and to state&quot; whether he is or is not satisfied with such&quot; method, giving reasons therefor.&quot; Receipts and Expenditure, Control Period, 1914.&quot; The Investigator is not expected to examine&quot; vouchers or to test the accuracy of the figures&quot; produced, except in cases where such figures&quot; are the result of the application of a regulation&quot; contained in the Memorandum of Instructions&quot; in regard to any specified item of receipts and&quot; expenditure, such as parcel post receipts, re-&quot; newals of permanent way and rolling stock,&quot; etc., etc.&quot; Net Receipts, half-years to 50th June, 1913&quot; and 1914.&quot; In accordance with Clause (10) of the Memo-&quot; randum, the Investigator to satisfy himself&quot; that tho net receipts of the two half-years have&quot; been prepared on the same basis.&quot; The Investigator should, on completion of his&quot; examination, obtain a copy of tho final account,&quot; certified as such by the accountant of the com-&quot; pany i concerned,  and  send  it  in  with hisreport.&quot;The procedure of Investigation of CompensationClaims was subsequently applied to the claims inrespect of arrears of maintenance and interest oncapital.Subsequently to the issue of the foregoing in-structions to the investigators, the Accountants&apos;Committee prepared sets of questions (prints ofwhich can be produced, if desired) for the investi-gators to answer when they were reporting the re-sults of their investigation of the various companies&apos;accounts, these questions being directed to thosepoints, in the instructions which needed to be mostcarefully watched.The procedure and functions of the bodies set&apos;up,as already described, for the purpose of examiningthe claims against the Government, are briefly sum-marised below:  1. A company&apos;s claim is first of all reported uponby the two investigators, after examinationon the spot, whose report is forwarded tothe Accountants&apos; Committee.2. If the investigators&apos; report and the claim raiseno doubtful points, they are despatched bythe Accountants&apos; Committee to the Govern-ment Accountant. If, however, any furtherinformation is required, the committee com-municate with the company and/or the in-vestigators, and if they are able to clear upthe matter, the claim is forwarded to theGovernment Accountant with a note of theaction taken by the Committee.3. If-no settlement is reached on1 a disputed claim,the point at issue is referred to the Compen-sation Accounts Committee, unless the samepoint has been previously dealt with by thatcommittee, in which event the report andclaim are sent on to the GovernmentAccountant with a reference to the previousreport of the Compensation Accounts Com-mittee on the same point.4. The Compensation Accounts Committee in deal-ing with disputed claims, after hearing theviews of a oompany whose claim is not passed, by the Accountants&apos; Committee, report tothe Executive Committee whether theyagree with the accountants, setting out intheir report the contentions of the company,and, if necessary, the reasons why they donot accept these.   The following are thestages preliminary to making their re-port :  (a) Informal meeting of committee toconsider accountants&apos; conclusions.(b) Letter from committee to companyconcerned suggesting a meeting to enablethe company to lay its contentions beforethe committee.(c) Mooting with company.(d) Letter to company, stating (if such bethe case) that the Committee are unable torecommend any variation from the opinionof the accountants, and asking for a writtenstatement of the company&apos;s contentions.(e) Report to the Railway Executive Com-mittce containing:  (i) Accountants&apos; opinion.(ii) Company&apos;s contention.(iii) The Committee&apos;s conclusion.(iv) Recommendation that the report beforwarded to the Governmentaccountant.5. Consideration by the Railway Executive Com-mitteo of tho report of tho CompensationAccounts Committee and dispatch of sameto the Government accountant.The   consideration   of   claims    both    by    theaccountants and the Compensation Accounts Com-mittee is limited to the question whether the claimis in accordance  with  the   issued  regulations  orinstructions, and it is not regarded as any part ofthe function of either body to deal with the meritsof  the   claim   apart  from   such   regulations   orinstructions, the view  of  the  Railway  ExecutiveCommittee being that such questions should be leftto the Government accountants or other representa-tives of the Government.  The most that has beendone is in exceptional cases to draw the attentionof  the   Government   accountants   to   any   specialfeatures in a claim, where it has seemed to theCommittee  that  a  literal  carrying  out   of   theinstructions might involve hardship or anomaly.It will be readily understood that the members ofthe Railway Executive Committee undertook theseduties with a certain degree of reluctance, notbecause i&apos;t was adding a load to what in any casepromised to be a heavy enough burden-both ofwork and responsibility but because they saw thatthey might be placed in a position where their dutyto their companies and their self-imposed duty to theGovernment would clash, or seem to clash, or thatat any rate they might be called upon to take actionin matters where the interests of their company andthose of the Government were not identical.However, they felt it to be their duty to renderto the Government whatever assistance it was intheir power to render, and so far from the interestsof the country having suffered from their participa-tion in the financial questions that arose out of theGovernment control of railways, as suggested incertain quarters, they believe that the work doneby the Railway Executive Committee and theAccountants&apos; Committee in these matters was of verygreat value to the Government and saved the countrya very large sum of money.-After the passing of the Ministry of Transport Act,and when it had been announced by the Minister thathe had set up a staff to check and audit the claimsof -the companies against the Government, it wasrather assumed.that the accountants would be. allowedto return to their normal duties and be spared thevery onerous work which, at the request of the Rail-way Executive Committee, they had voluntarilyundertaken in order to assist the Government in thestress of war.But the Minister of Transport requested that theaccountants should continue to act, at any rate untilhis own staff were more conversant with their duties,but that the staff of the Ministry should be given anopportunity of attending the proceedings of, theaccountants and investigators.In assenting to this request the Council of the Rail-way Companies Association said that while in viewof the importance which the Ministry attached totheir representatives being associated with theaccountants of the companies at the meetings at&apos;which
tho compensation claims were discussed and at theinvestigation of the accounts, they were prepared torecommend the companies concerned to fall in withthis procedure, they shared the doubts already ex-pressed to the Ministry as to whether the alteredprocedure would tend to increased efficiency, as theyfeared it might create a sense of divided responsi-bility.In consequence of the request of the Minister ofTransport, the Committee of Accountants have con-tinued to act substantially as they did during thewar, their number (14) being made to correspondwith that of tho Standing Committee of GeneralManagers.Before leaving this part of the subject referenceshould be made to the steps taken by the Treasuryand the Board of Trade at the outset of the war toinsure accuracy and honesty on the part of the con-trolled railway companies in making up theiraccounts, apart from the assistance they sought andobtained from the technical staff of the companiesthemselves.In Sir William Plender&apos;s memorandum of 29thSeptember, 1914, he recommended that:&quot; The Accounts as submitted to the Board of&quot; Trade should have a certificate attached signed&quot; by the chief accountant, the auditors and tho&quot; professional accountants of each railway com-&quot; pany, somewhat on the following lines:  &quot; We have examined the accounts attached&quot; with the books and vouchers of the com-&quot; pany, and we certify to their correctness&quot; and that they have been prepared strictly&quot; in acordance with the agreement entered&quot; into with His Majesty&apos;s Government and&quot; with the Memorandum dated..................,&quot; 1914, issued by the Committee of Chief&quot; Accountants.&quot;At the meeting at the Board of Trade on the 25thNovember, 1914, this suggestion of Sir WilliamPlender was adopted, the only modification madebeing that instead of the certificate having to besigned by the chief accountant, the auditors andthe professional accountants of each railway com-pany, the certificate was to be signed by the chiefaccountant and the auditors or the professionalaccountants of each railway company, the reasonfor this alteration being that the practice as to theaudit of accounts varies on different railways; somecompanies have professional accountants as theirAuditors, others have non-professional auditors whoare assisted by professional accountants.The above form of certificate and the signaturesto be appended were amended in accordance with therequirements of tho Treasury, as stated in theirletter to the Board of Trade of 1st January, 1915,as follows:  &quot; We have examined the accounts attached&quot; and compared them with the books and&quot; vouchers of the company. We certify that&apos;.&apos; they are correct and that they have been pre-&quot; pared strictly in accordance with tho Memo-&quot; randum dated 1915 issued by the Committee&quot; of Chief Accountants with tho approval of&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;This decision was circulated to the Companies onthe 13th January, 1915.Early in 1915 Mr. Gurney Fowler raised a. questionwith regard to the absence of comparative figures inthe proposed form of accounts, and in the course ofa letter on the subject, he referred to the form ofcertificate, which had been settled by: the Treasuryas above mentioned, as &quot;a very stringent printedcertificate.&quot;To meet the point raised by Mr. Fowler it wasarranged that each company should render a com-parative statement showing the revenue receiptsand expenditure for the half-years ended 31stDeceinber, 1913-1914, in the same detail as isrequired by the Statutory Form of Accounts, andthe increase or decrease of each item, and Mr. Fowlerexpressed himself as satisfied with the arrangementsmade.The acceptance of the agreed form of certificateas an adequate safeguard for the Government isreferred to in the following extract from a letter,dated 1st June, 1915, from the Board of Trade tothe Railway Executive Committee, in reply to anenquiry from the latter as to the position of SirWilliam Plender and Mr. Gurney Fowler in relationto the audit of the accounts of the railway companies,which sets out very fully the position as regardsaccountancy safeguards as viewed by the Board ofTrade:-&quot; The Board of Trade, in consultation with&quot; the Treasury, considered the question as to&quot; the scope of tho examination to which tho&quot; accounts of the companies should bo subjected&quot; on behalf of the Government; and, seeing that&quot; the accounts of all companies are at present&quot; subject to an audit which is entirely inde-&quot; pendent of tho management of the companios,&quot; they were of opinion that payments can&quot; properly bo made, upon certificates by these&quot; independent auditors, subject to a general&quot; scrutiny of the character hereinafter referred&quot; to.&quot; it was proposed that, in the first place, the&quot; companies themselves should prepare drafts&quot; of certain instructions and schedules, that&quot; these drafts should be submitted to the Board&quot; of Trade, and that, when finally settled, they&quot; should be issued through the companies to their&quot; accountants, who would prepare the accounts&quot; on the lines thus laid down. This procedure&quot; was, as you know, followed, and the instruc-&quot; tions have, it is understood, been issued to all&quot; tho companies whose undertakings were taken&quot; over under the Act.&quot;&quot;It is further proposed that the accounts will&quot; in due course be audited by the professional&quot; auditors of the companies, and will ultimately&quot; be submitted to the Board of Trade with a&quot; view to the final payment of compensation&quot; when the control period has come to an end.&quot; Before being finally passed for payment, the&quot; certified claims will be referred to a consulting&quot;accountant whose duty it will be to satisfy&quot;himself that the principles laid down in the&quot; instructions have been followed, and he will&quot; also consider more particularly the methods&quot; adopted in regard to such matters as doprecia-&quot; tion and tho allocation of charges between&quot;revenue and capital account.   The consulting&quot; accountant would rely in the main on the cer-&quot; tificates of the professional auditors of the com-*    d1 &quot;panies,  and  conduct detailed  investigations--H-,      &quot;only if and when questions arise in the course&quot; of examination which appear to make such&quot; investigations necessary, and he would also bo&quot; generally responsible for seeing that the claims&quot; are in order.&quot;Reference may also be made to the letters whichpassed between the accountants&apos; committee and theGovernment accountants at the end of 1915 when theaccounts of a number of the companies for tho fivemonths of 1914 had been considered by the latter.The chairman of the Committee  (Mr. Whitelaw)wrote to each of them (Sir William Plender and Mr.Gurney Fowler) asking whether  there were  anypoints of general principle in regard to the mannerin which the accounts had been compiled which theydesired to raise.    He reminded them that beforevery long the companies Avould have to take stepsto prepare their,accounts for the year 1915, and saidthat for this reason it would be a great convenienceif the Committee had before them in good time par-ticulars of any such questions.   In reply each of theGovernment accountants stated that they knew of nosuch questions apart from certain matters that hadbeen discussed at a recent interview.Dealing now with the matters referred to in thenotes handed to Sir Herbert Walker and Sir A. KayoButterworth on the 15th Deceinber, so far as theyarc not covered by what has been already said:  (1) The Railway View on the Connection betweenthe Original Agreement and the Act of 1871.The agreement must be regarded as a workingarrangement intended to meet one main difficultyinherent in the situation created by tho Government,&quot; taking possession &quot;of practically all the railways inGreat Britain under the Act of 1871.
That Act (or rather S. 16 of it) is extraordinarilygeneral and vague in its language so much so thatwidely different views were and are still held as tothe meaning, or at any rate the legal results, of this&quot; taking possession,&quot; some people attributing to itapparently very little effect beyond what might boachieved by the exercise of tho powers conferred bythe Act of 1888, and others regarding it asequivalent to something little, if at all, short oftemporary nationalisation, while between these twoextreme theories there seem to be a variety of inter-* mediate views.Tho difficulty of interpreting the Act came out veryclearly at tho outset of the negotiations in August,1914, when the Railway Executive Committee wereinclined to take tho view that one result of theGovernments &quot; possession &quot; would be that allrailway receipts became automatically the propertyof the Government, and were told by the Board ofTrade that this was not the view of the Law Officersof the Crown.But apart from the difficulties of interpretationtho situation itself was full of difficulty. No oneknew what the result of the war would bo uponrailway travel and railway transport, but whateverhappened the railways would have to be kept infunds to meet current expenses, which could not beimmediately reduced without adding seriously to theunemployment that many people looked for.But perhaps from the point of view of the Boardof Trade, with their special responsibilities in con-nection with the control (to use the word which verysoon superseded the statutory term &quot; possession &quot;),the most embarrassing factor was the liabilityimposed on the Government by the Act of 1871 topay &quot; full compensation &quot; to the companies affected.It is, clear from the records of what passed before andat the very commencement of the war that the Govern-ment were very much impressed and, indeed, em-barrassed by the fact that under the Act of 1871 eachrailway had to bo treated as a separate organisation,with its independent right to compensation, and if, asmight easily happen, one railway were to gain from thewar through a large flow of military and navaltraffic, while another lost (lost, that is to say, notmerely as a result of war, but as a result of Covern-ment control), tho Act provided no means of settingoff the gain against the loss. The railway companiesas a whole might be.no worse off, and yet the Statemight have to pay large sums for compensation.Of course, there, were large operating advantagesto be derived from a pool, because it would enablethose in control of the railways to disregard allfinancial considerations in connection with routingand conveyance of traffic, and in time of War effi-ciericy of operation must be the paramount cdnsider-ation: but the point above referred to undoubtedlyweighed with the Government in making the par-ticular form of agreement which they did.To sum up, therefore, the agreement was, in thefirst place, a working arrangement, which should (1) enable the railways to &quot; carry on&quot; financiallywithout embarrassment, for they would meetcurrent outgoing out of current receipts,plus such instalments  of  &quot; compensation &quot;as might be found necessary, and(2) enable those in control of the railways to de-vote their thoughts and energies entirely toquestions of efficient operation.But the agreement merely dealt, and could onlyhave been intended to deal with one aspect of com-ponsation. It may even be said that it made a.use ofthe &quot; compensation clause &quot; which could hardly havebeen contemplated by the framers of the Act, for bythe agreement; as eventually constnied and acted,upon, the so-called &quot; compensation &quot; became theprice which the Government paid for the con-veyanco of its war traffic, while from a legal pointof view compensation for loss sustained by the exer-cise of statutory powers and payment for servicesrendered are essentially different things.However that, may be, the agreement dealt onlywith what may be termed the day-to-day side of the&quot;compensation&quot; question-one, may call it the&quot; revenue &quot; side of the question as distinguishedfrom the &quot; capital &quot; side. It made no attempt todeal with the contingency which necessarily lay be-hind, viz., the extent to which at the end of Govern-ment &quot; possession &quot; or &quot; control &quot; it might be foundthat, apart from any question of dividends or notrevenue during the period of such possession or con-trol, any company or companies had suffered lossthrough the, exercise by the Government of its statu-tory powers.No doubt at the outset everyono&apos;s mind wasdirected to other objects no one realised at firstthat tho Government control was to be a matter ofyears and not months, but it is believed to have alwaysbeen the view of the railway companies and theiradvisers that an overriding term of the arrangement,implied from the outset (or perhaps it would be morecorrect to say a fundamental principle of the Act,unaffected by tho special agreemont as to revenuo orinterim compensation), was that the undertakingsof the railway companies must be returned by theGovernment to the proprietors unimpaired, eitherphysically or as revenue-earning undertakings.The fact that the payments by the Governmentwould cease with the &quot; possession &quot; in itself demon-strates that the agreement provides no compensationfor loss or injury (attributable to the exercise of thepowers of the Secretary of State) existing at the endof State possession and enduring thereafter, and thisview of the arrangement is* supported by the historyof the agreement and supplementary arrangementsas well as by the provisions of the Ministry of Trans-port Act and the statement of the Home Secretaryin the House of Commons on 2nd July, 1919.That statement was made in the following circum-stances:  Major Barnes moved an amendment (see Hansard,Vol. 117, No. 86, page 631) designed to limit anycompensation payable to that provided for by theagreement or arrangement of August, 1914. Instating that the Government were not prepared toaccept the amendment, Mr. Shortt (Home Secretary)said:  &quot; I agree that railways which are taken under&quot; the Act of 1871 are to have full Compensation.&quot; We know that there was an agreement entered&quot; into at the beginning of the war, but it has&quot; been perfectly clear that, owing to circum-&quot; stances which have since arisen, the railway&quot; companies would not be getting, under that&quot; agreement, the full compensation to which thejr&quot; were entitled under the Act.&quot;Prom this it is clear that, in the view of the Gov-ernment on 2nd July, 1919, the agreement of August,1914, was not exhaustive of the question of com-pensation. -(2) Railway Executive Committee :, Constitution,Powers and Functions, vis-a-vis Government,vis-a-vis Railway Companies.The constitution of the Railway Executive Com-mittee and tho circumstances leading up to its forma-tion have already been explained.As regards its functions; it is impossible to speakwith anything approaching&apos;accurate definition,- forthe simple reason that no attempt whatever wasmade at any time to lay down their limits, or eventheir character.To a great extent they, acted as a &quot;-Watson bodybetween the Government on the one hand and theirown boards of directors and the boards of otherrailway companies on the other, and no clear linewas drawn between their functions or actions in thatcapacity and their duties as executive agents of theGovernment,&apos;In early days it was said that the principal dutiesof the Committee on mobilization wwild be &quot;to co-.(i ordinate . the railway transport requirements in,&quot; connection with the mobilization of the naval and&quot; military forces, concentrations of the latter, the&quot; transit of war material, and the maintenance of the&quot;food supplies of. the civil population; to so apportion&apos;&quot; the traffic as to secure the best results, to agree&apos;&apos;. programmes with the view of avoiding any clashing&apos; &apos; of interests, and to refer to the President of theBoard of Trade if they are unable to do this.&quot;
But that assuredly gives a very imperfect des-cription of the work undertaken at 35, ParliamentStreet, the headquarters of the Railway ExecutiveCommittee, and the place where in the early weeksof the war the Committee met three and four times aday, apart from tho almost continuous sittings ofvarious sub-committees.Primarily the Railway Executive Committee is tobe regarded as the expert body to whom the Govern-ment entrusted the practical carrying on of the rail-ways of which it had taken possession under statutorypowers, and seeing that nearly all the largo railwaysill England and one of the Scotch railway companieswere represented on the Committee, the arrangementhad tho advantage of involving the minimum dis-turbance of the existing regime.But the functions and authority of th.. Committeeas a matter of strict definition must, it would soem,turn largely on the view taken as to the effect ofthe &quot; possession &quot; of the railways by the Govern-ment. If the Government wore in &quot; possession &quot; inthe fullest sense of the term, there would be littleor nothing left for tho general managers who formedthe Railway Executive Committee to do vis a visthe public or other companies, or indeed as regardstheir own railways, except as the representativesand agents of the Government. If, on the otherhand, the Governments &quot; possession &quot; were a muchmore limited matter, there would presumably be aremnant of power left in the respective boards ofdirectors and general managers of the various com-panies, including those represented on the Com-mittee.In either case, the only power which tho RailwayExecutive Committee had over other companies wasnecessarily as the agents of the Government; exceptin that capacity all they could do was to advise.It is believed that the wider view of the &quot; posses-sion &quot; was, broadly speaking, the view generally&apos;acted upon, and that in issuing circular letters tothe various railway companies the Committee lookedupon themselves as announcing the directions of theGovernment. In point of fact, not only was SirHerbert Walker, who was Acting Chairman of theCommittee throughout the war, almost daily, andother members of the Committee very frequently,in personal touch with the War Office and Board ofTrade, but the more important circular letters wereeither submitted to the Board of Trade before beingissued, or embodied instructions which t&apos;hj Board ofTrade had already notified or authorised.It is only right, however, to say that the Com-mittee were much more concerned with &quot; carryingon &quot; efficiently than with any technical questions ofauthority. They were convinced that th more therailway companies were allowed to run their ownbusiness, the better for the nation; therefore, asregards those railways which were not representedon the Committee, they, interfered with their manage-ment as little as was consistent with seeming, first,the best possible train services for all importanttraffics, and secondly, uniformity of action in allmatters where such uniformity was necessary ordesirable, and such directions as they found itnecessary to issue met with very unquestioningacquiescence on the part of all concerned. As regardstheir own railways, which carried more than three-quarters of the entire traffic, from first to last therewas a very near approach to unanimity among themembers of the Committee as regards all importantquestions. In these circumstances, the Committeedid not feel it incumbent upon them to be alwaysraising questions of authority, and they believe thattheir action (or absence of action) in this respect wasjustified by the result.The foregoing remarks have no application to thefunctions of the Railway Executive Committee visa vis the Government and, therefore, as regardsfinance.Prom, the first (again, without much, if any,enquiry as to the source of their authority) themembers of the Railway Executive Committee under-took the negotiation of financial terms with theGovernment on behalf of the railway companiesgenerally, and in all such negotiations they actedentirely as the representatives, accredited or notas the case may be, of the companies, and not inany sense as the representatives of the Government.Of course the Railway Executive Committee hadno authority to conclude bargains on behalf of anycompany (in many cases no authority to negotiate),and when their negotiations with the representativesof the Government were concluded the results had tobe submitted for confirmation to the boards of thevarious companies. As a rule, but not always, suchconfirmation Avas forthcoming, and the terms thenbecame operative between the Government and theindividual companies.This must not be understood to imply that, whenbargaining with the Government on financial matters,tho general managers felt justified in extracting themost onerous terms they could from those who intheso matters represented the Government,&quot; or hadany desire to do so.Far from it; throughout, though they did notalways get their Avay, they did their utmost to befair and to see both sides of the case, and Avhile inall matters of bargaining they regarded their dutiesas being primarily towards their shareholders, theyrealised to the full that it was their duty to abstainfrom taking any advantage of the very special cir-cumstances created by the national emergency.It is believed that throughout the representativesof the Government appreciated the position, viz.,that Avhile the general managers concerned felt ittheir duty to obtain fair terms for their shareholders,they did not wish to obtain any advantage for themthat Avas unfair to the State, and there can be littledoubt that the recognition of this by the Governmentrepresentatives greatly facilitated the negotiationof arrangements fair to both sides, whereas, had adifferent spirit pervaded the negotiations on eitherside, agreement might have proved almost un-attainable.But bargains with the Government formed onlyone side of the financial work undertaken by theRailway Executive Committee, and in financialmatters, from the very outset and throughout thewar, the general managers who formed the RailwayExecutive Committee acted in a dual capacity (1)against the Government in bargaining (&quot; against &quot;only in the sense of representing the opposite sideto the bargain in the mariner just described) and (2)for the Government, in advising on matters ofaccountancy and supervising the accounts of therailway companies in the manner already described.In this latter capacity they acted, in the main,as voluntary helpers of the Government, and inissuing instructions to the companies with referenceto their accounts they no doubt purported to actas the representatives and with the authority of theGovernment, so far as any department of theGovernment had itself authority to issue suchinstructions.To sum up, it may be said, broadly speaking,that-(I.) In matters  of  operation,  the RailwayExecutive Committee represented the Govern-,v ment and acted as agents of the Board of Trade,.j.  vis a vis boiih tjie public and the railway com-panies. -((II.) In matters of bargaining, i.e., the finan-cial arrangements between the Government onthe one hand and the railway companies on theother, they represented the railway companies(all or some) for the purpose of negotiating,though not of concluding, bargains.(III.) In other matters of finance, i.e., thecarrying out of the financial arrangementsarrived at between the Government and therailway companies, they acted as helpers of theGovernment, without, it would seem, any obli-gation in the matter, beyond the obligationwhich lies upon every volunteer, viz., to use allproper care and make the best use of such expertknowledge as he possesses.
5Lastly (IV.) In matters relating to wages andivar bonus, and conditions of service generally,where the Government did not (as in the grantof the 8 hours&apos; day) deal with the matter directly,the Committee acted as the agents of the Gov-ernmeut, with limited authority and generallyunder definite instructions.(3) Investigation op Claims : Constitution, Powersand Functions of Investigators, Accountants&apos;Sub-Committee and Compensation xVccountsCommittee  vis-a-vis   Government  and  com-panies.These matters so far as they relate to constitutionand function have already been fully dealt with.As regards powers, for the reasons already indicated,it is impossible to say much. Beginning at the bottom,the investigators&apos; merely acted as the subordinatesof tho Accountants&apos; Committee, from whom thoy tooktheir instructions. They were in all cases membersof the staff of the accountants who formed theAccountants&apos; Committee. Their duty was to reportto that Committee and they had no &quot;powers&quot; atall beyond what the railway companies themselvesagreed in 1914 to give them, viz., the right to comeand inspect their accounts and ask questions aboutthem.Next, tho Accountants&apos; Committee. They actedunder the instructions and authority of the RailwayExecutive Committee, whose technical advisers theywore. They, like the investigators, had no &quot; powers,&quot;in the sense of being in a position to give ordersor lay down authoritative interpretations of rightsor obligations.But indirectly, no doubt, they exercised consider-able power, on account of their extensive and detailedknowledge of all matters connected with railwayaccounts. They were in close touch with the Govern-ment accountants, and no doubt it was of greatadvantage both to the Government and to the rail-way companies, especially in the early days, that sucha good understanding existed between them and thosegentlemen. ,The scrutiny of the compensation claims by theAccountants&apos; Committee was a very real scrutiny, andif the accountants reported adversely upon the claimof any company, that company had an exceedinglyuphill task in getting their decision (or rather ex-pression of opinion) reversed, though there wereoccasions on which a company fared better at thehands of the Government accountants or. the Boardof Trade than it did with the Accountants&apos; Com-mittee.The Compensation Accounts Committee also had no&quot; powers.&quot; It reported on the claims of companieswhere there had been a difference of opinion betweena company and the Committee of Accountants, andon a variety of questions specifically referred to it.Also, sometimes it conducted negotiations; but theCommittee, as such, had no power beyond that ofexpressing its views.In a word, the &quot; power&quot; of the three bodiesreferred to, though in practice it may have been real,was indirect, and, speaking strictly, was non-existent.(4) Government   Accountants :    Relations   withRailway  Executive Committee; Accountants&apos;Sub-Committee, &amp;g.  Railway Executive Com-&apos; mittee&apos;s View as to; Authority of Government&quot; Accountants : as to Auth6rity of AccountingInstructions.It has already been explained that the accountinginstructions had strictly no authority as against anycompany that refused to comply with them.How far any particular company may have beenor may now be stopped from raising this contentionis obviously not a matter upon which an opinioncan be expressed.But looking at the question quite strictly, itwould seem that an instruction must either haveaccurately expressed the effect of the Agreement, inwhich case it may be called unnecessary, or it didnot do so, in which case it involved an alteration ofthe Agreement which it was open to any conipanyto refuse to accept.Probably the converse would not be true. If aninstruction gave something more than the agreementand was issued with the authority of the Govern-mont, it would hardly be open to the Governmentafterwards to repudiate it; similarly, in tho case ofan instruction originally issued without authority butafterwards acquiesced in or tacitly accepted by theGovernment or its representatives.But in practice very few questions aro believed tohave arisen as to what are called the accountinginstructions; it will be found that in substantially ailcases these instructions were nothing more than fairinterpretations or working regulations that is, theystated what was impliedly contained in the arrange-ment or was to bo reasonably inferred as expressingthe intention of the parties.As regards the Government accountants, the Rail-way Executive Committee and the Accountants&apos; Com-mittee regarded them as the representatives of theGovernment. They, of course, had no means ofknowing the measure of their authority, but assumedthat in matters beyond their authority the Govern-ment accountants would refer to the Government forinstructions, and on a number of occasions this wasin fact done.With reference to the annual compensation claimsof tho companies, the Railway Executive Committeeunderstood that these, when properly cortified by theauditors and accountants of the respective companies,were in ordinary course to be referred to the Govern-ment accountants, as explained in Sir William Mar-wood&apos;s letter of 1st June, 1915.The practice, therefore, was for the Accountants&apos;Committee, when a claim appeared to them to be inorder, to forward it to the Government accountant(that is, to Mr. Gurney Fowler and afterwards SirAlbert Wyon, unless their firm acted as auditors forthe Company, in which case the claim was sent to SirWilliam Plender) and, so far as the Railway Execu-tive Committee were aware, if the claim was passedby him, it was treated by the Government Depart-ments as being in order, and in due course a chequewas paid by the Treasury and the matter was closed.But no final settlement of any claim was made by theRailway Executive Committee or Accountants&apos; Com-mittee until it had been passed by one of the Govern-ment accountants.(5) Division of Revenue Account Above and Belowthe Line : Circumstances Surrounding.This matter has already been referred to (antep. 4). The fact of interest being included in AccountNo. 8 was the determining factor in bringing aboutthe decision to limit the Government guarantee tothe first seven items of the account.Rents and other items were more or less imma-terial, their amount being small, and the chance ofloss or gain to the companies negligible; but it wasnot unnatural that the Government should hesitateto guarantee the interest accounts of the companies,and the inclusion of the item of interest would un-doubtedly have complicated the arrangements onaccount of the way in which, as already explained,interest is dealt with in railway accounts (seepage 4).Moreover, there are many items of interest whichwere quite unaffected by Government control, andwhich there seemed no ground for bringing withinthe agreement (e.g., the &quot;allowance of interest onsuperannuation funds, bank deposits, etc.) beingwholly unconnected with traffic.(6) War Bonus Contributions&apos;: Circumstancesleading up to commutation in 1917;As already stated, the railway companies agreedto bear 25 per cent, of the first war bonus grantedin February, 1915, to certain grades.When the bonus was increased to an all round 5s.per week in October, 1915, the accountants drewattention to the impracticability of continuing tocharge the railway net revenue with 25 per cent, ofthe original bonus, and it was proposed to the Gov-ernment and agreed that the first bonus should betreated as equivalent to 2s. 6d., and that the liabilityof the companies should be arrived at by assuming
it to be equal to 12J per cent, of the increased warbonus payment.In September, 1916, the bonus was increased to10s. per week, and the proportion borne by the com-panies was correspondingly reduced, viz., to 6i percent.In April, 1917, the bonus was increased to 15s. porweek with a further addition in case of Sunday duty.13y that time the separate calculation of the propor-tiou of war bonus payable by the companies wasfound to involve the companies in considerabletrouble, and it was thought that the best plan wouldbe to commute the percentage for a lump sum.This was done as from 1st January, 1917, on thebasis of the amount chargeable to the controlledcompanies for the year 1916.The matter was treated as purely one of account&quot;ancy, the only object being simplification of calcula-tion, and when the Circular Letter to the companieswas issued a copy was sent to the Board of Trade witha request that they would notify the Treasury of itscontents.Since the date of the Armistice the whole conditionsof service of railwaymen have been completely altered,and of course war bonuses in their old form havedisappeared, but the companies have continued topay annually, out of their own funds, the commutedamount.(7) Proviso Deduction: as to 1913 being a PeakYear.The origin of the &quot; proviso &quot; and the oircum-stances which led to its discontinuance as from 1stJanuary, 1915, have already been explained.Undoubtedly 1913 was a &quot; peak &quot; year, but notto the extent that the Board of Trade returns wouldseem to indicate, where the figures given are:- Page 21.-Net receipts, 1911     ...    48,581,746,,       1912     ...    47,329,074Page 79.-Net income,   1913     ...    52,130,879These figures, however, are not comparable, owingto the alteration in the form of accounts for the year1913.Comparable figures were prepared at Sir WilliamPlender\s request, and were submitted by him to theRates Advisory Committee. They appear at page 48(12th October,&apos; 1920) of the Notes of Evidence of therecent inquiry into rates revision, and are asunder:  Net income available for interest and dividends  1911      .........    47,480,8231912      .........    46,423,7851913.........    48,856,451Average......      ...    47,587,020The difference between these two sets of figures ismainly due to the fact that, in arriving at the latter,charges upon net income in respect of rent charges,rents of leased and worked lines, etc., have been de-ducted. The amount of such charges is considerablygreater in 1913, because in that year, as a conse-quence of the new form of accounts, all such cliargeswere dealt with after the ascertainment of the figureof net income of  52,130,879, whereas in 1911 and 1912certain of the charges were dealt with before theascertainment of the respective figures of net receiptsquoted in the Board of Trade railway returns.It will be seen that, taking comparable figures,1913 is only  1,375,628 higher than 1911, and 1,269,431 higher than the average of three years,without making any allowance for additional capitalexpenditure.The fact that both in 1911 and 1912 there wore dis-turbing factors in the one year a railway strike, andin the other coal, ote, strikes, which in each caseworked to the detriment of the railway companies,points to those years or even an average of the threeyears (1911-13)-being unsuitable for the purposes ofthe agreement, viewed in relation to aggregate netreceipts.But if an agreement was to bo arrived at on thelines desired by the Government, it was necessary toselect a period that was not only free from objectionas between the Government on the one side and therailway companies collectively on the other, but thatwas fair as botween individual companies; failingthat, it could hardly bo expected that the tormssuggested would be accepted by all companies, andunanimity was essential to the scheme.The proportion of coal traffic on different companiesvaries very greatly ; consequently different companieswere differently affected by the coal strike in 1912.The effects of the strike were reflected in the mineraltraffic receipts of tho different companies, whichshowed an aggregate falling off for tho June half-year, as compared with the corresponding period in1911, of about  1,400,000; hut the drop in receiptsin the case of the larger companies varied from 5 or6 per cent, in tho case of some of the southern linesto more than 18 per cent, on the North Eastorn;while still higher percentages-in some cases over30 per cent__were disclosed in the accounts of someof the smaller companies largely dependent on mineralcarryings.Thoro is another consideration which would havemade it unfair to the railway companies to base theagreement on the years .1911-1912. After tho railwaystrike in August, 1911, tho wages of many grades ofrailwaymen were substantially increased, but owingto tho delay in passing the Railway and Canal TrafficAct, 1913, the companies were not in a position torecoup themselves) for this additional expenditureuntil July, 1913. The net roceipts were thus undulydepressed during the intervening poriod.This last point affects also tho comparison between1913 and 1914. The accounts of tho companies forthe first six months of thoso two years showed, asalready pointed out (ante page 5) a falling off in1914 of  732,501; but in that year most of tho railwaycompanies had made reserves in respect of tho increasein their goods rates which they had made under theprovisions of the Act of 1913, but, which hadbeen challenged hy the traders. These reservesprohablv amounted in the aggregate to at least 300,000 or  400,000, so that the real differencebetween the two periods is only about one halfof the amount shown by the accounts, and therailway companies might fairly have claimed thatin applying the proviso, under which accountwas taken of the fact that the receipts in 1914 werethought by the Government to point to a falling offin traffic, the amount of the reserves should bo addedto the net receipts of 1914.Altogether it is submitted that there is very littlein tho suggestion, if such has been made to the Com-mittee, that tho selection of 1913 was unfair to theGovernment as having been a &quot; peak &quot; year.It must be borne in mind that the iGovernmentsaw substantial advantage to the State in adoptingthis particular form of agreement, and the stipulationon the part of the companies that the Governmentguarantee should be based on the year 1913 seemsin all the circumstances tp have been a perfectly fairone. In point of fact, as already pointed out (antep. 5), up to the date of the Armistice the Agree-mont worked out distinctly favourably to theGovernment.(8) Circumstances in which Clause 4 of the BlueBook was Amended by Circular 686 (IncreasedFirst Cost).Tho circumstances in which Clause 4 of the BlueBook was amended hy Circular Letter No. 686 havealready been outlined in connection with the supple-mentary clauses.It will be remembered that one of the &quot;SixPoints &quot; raised by the Railway Executive Committeein connection with these clauses was &quot; Charges forRenewal of Permanent Way and Rolling Stock.&quot;The regulations, as they then stood, were thoughtto press hardly on what aro known as &quot;non-programme&quot; companies, that is, companies whosepractice it is to charge to working expenses citherthe actual amount expended upon renewals in eachyear or an indefinite sum according to circumstances.Under the regulations, as interpreted, if such a com-pany spent more on renewals &quot;in the control poriodthan it spent on the corresponding item in 1913, theexcess was disallowed, whereas, if it spent less, itscharge against tho Government was limited to itsactual expenditure, &apos; -The regulations also were not clear as to how farit was open to a company to include a charge for
renewals in respect of additions to rolling stock ormileage of line.The Board of Trade and Treasury thought thematter was one to be dealt with by the GovernmentAccountants as one of interpretation of regulations,ff   and left it to be dealt with in that way.The amendment, therefore, took the form of an&quot; agreed interpretation of Article 4,&quot; meaningArticle 4 of tho Blue Book, and was drafted so as toremove the hardship referred to and to make clear,by a more detailed enumeration, what were thecircumstances in which a company could claim to beallowed to charge a larger expenditure for renewalsthan the amount included in its accounts in thecorresponding period of 1913.These were defined as the sums-(1) necessary to make provision for the renewal of (a) additional mileage of line, or(b) additional units or increased first costof rolling stock in service;(2) attributable to increased rates of pay or pricesof  materials paid in  respect of renewalscarried out during the period and chargeableagainst the Government.The words &quot; increased first cost of rolling stock inservice &quot;   affected   companies   which   based   theirrenewal programmes on the prime cost of their stock.When the draft interpretation was sent to theGovernment Accountants for their approval, theirattention was specially drawn to this fact, and theyexpressed their approval of the words in question,which are believed to have been in accordance withthe action previously taken by them in relation tothe accounts that had been submitted to them forthe period August to December, 1914.The &quot; agreed interpretation &quot; was sent out withCircular letter 686, dated 28th September, 1916.i.(9) Circumstances in which Arrears of Main-tenance Instructions were amended providingthat there should me no set-off betweenAbstracts.There does not seem to have been any such amend-nient of the instructions as is suggested in the Notes.From the first, that is to say, from the time whenthe instructions embodied in the Yellow Book cameinto   operation,   the   arrears   of   maintenance   inAbstracts A and B were dealt with as follows:  (1) Abstracts A and B were treated as wholly sepa-rate and independent.(2) All items in Abstract A were treated together,e.(/., an excess on signalling was set offagainst a deficit in bridges or permanentway.(3) In other words, to entitle a company to chargeanything for arrears of maintenance underAbstract A, it had to show that the aggre-gate expenditure chargeable to the Abstract(after due allowance for difference in cost)was less than it had been in 1913.(4) The three parts of Abstract B (Le., locomo-tives, carriages and wagons) were looked attogether, so that an excess in locomotives, was set off against a deficit in carriages orwages and vice vend.Some companies thought this rather hard, and itis perhaps difficult to justify the arrangementlogically, for there seems no logical reason why acompany should not be allowed to make proper pro-vision in its accounts for unexecuted wagon repairssimply because it has exceeded its 1913 expenditure(say) on repairs of locomotives. (As regards re-newafs the position was altered by C.L. 686.)But the whole arrangement was of a give-and-takecharacter (e.(/., there was no particular logic in thopayment of 115 per cent, of pre-war cost) andthough in some cases it soemed rather unfair to thecompanies concerned to lump together tho threeparts of Abstract B, the Railway Executive Com-mittce thought that if a company wore to withdrawmen from carriages to wagons or vice versa withoutadequate reason, it would not have been an easything for the Government to detect or check.But from the first, that is to say, from the issueof the Yellow Book, when it was decided to mergethe three parts of Abstract B, no question seems tohave been raised as to Abstracts A and B being keptseparate.Moreover, there is certainly nothing to indicatethat when the question of arrears was first broached,in 1914, it was in anyone&apos;s mind that excess expendi-ture in one direction was to be sot off against arrearsin another for instance, that if a company had notbeen able to keep up its permanent way, its claimwas to be disallowed if its repairs to locomotives hadbeen in excess of 1913.(10) Circumstances in which Arrears of Main-tenance Formula was amended in Brown Bookas a result of which government was chargedwith the additional cost of excess renewals.It is understood that tho amendment of the formulareferred to in the Brown Book was due to theAccountants&apos; Committee coming to tho conclusion,after practical experience of the formula in theYollow Book, that the latter was incorrect. Thequestion involved is purely one of accountancy andis of an involved and intricate character, as ovi-denced by the fact that the Accountants&apos; Committeethemselves ciily arrived at their conclusion afterlong consideration, and that when they did so theyreversed their previous decision.A somewhat similar point, with regard to theallowance to bo made in respect of the extra (Le.,war time) cost of renewals in excess of the expendi-ture chargeable against the Government, arose in1919, with a similar result, and the GovernmentAccountants, after very carefully considering thepoint in consultation with the Ministry of Transport,arrived at the same conclusion as the Accountants&apos;Committee, which was contrary to the opinion theyhad expressed on a previous occasion in connectionwith a claim by one of the companies.(11) Circumstances leading up to formulation ofSupplementary Clauses (Pink Book).This has already been fully dealt with.
Submitted by Sir Alexander Butterworth.(Vide Questions 4337 and 4072 in Minutes of Evidence.)21st January, 1921.Departmental Committee on Railway Agreements.Dear Sir Alexander Butterworth,I am desired by Lord Colwyn to refer to your replyto Question 4337 in the Minutes of Evidence takenon Wednesday last, in which you said you wouldrather some other Member of the Railway ExecutiveCommittee spoke on the particular subject under dis-cussion, viz., the practice under which interest onthe sums paid by the Admiralty in respect of lostships is credited below-the-line, and to a numberof similar replies given by you at other times.Lord Colwyn would be glad if you would bring thosepoints to the attention of your colleagues and informhim at the earliest possible moment whether theydesire to tender evidence to the Committee on theseor any other points through another Member of thelate Railway Executive Committee.Yours very truly,(Signed)  E. Twentyman,Secretary to the Committee.Sir A. Kaye Butterworth.24th January, 1921.Departmental Committee on Railway Agreements.Dear Mr. Twentyman,With reference to your letter of tho 21st instantasking whether the General Managers desire to tenderevidence on any points through another member ofthe late Railway Executive Committee, I am sorrythat as there is no meeting of tho Standing Com-mittee this week I shall not have an opportunity ofconsulting my colleagues before Wednesday. I think,however, their answer would be that they do notwish to tender evidence.Speaking for myself, and assuming that the Com-mittee do not wish to examine mo with reference tothe arrangements between the Government and thecompanies about railway steamers (pp. 122-124 of theWhite Paper) about which I am not in a position tospeak, as I had practically nothing to do with themaking of these arrangements, it does not occur tome that there is any need to call another railwaywitness to give information to the Committee, butI need hardly point out that it is difficult to expressan opinion in the absence of information as to theevidence given to the Committee by previouswitnesses.Yours faithfully,(Signed) A. Kaye Butterworth.E. Twentyman, Esq.,Secretary,Departmental Committee on Railway Agreements.APPENDIX XXVIII.( Vide Question 4534 in Minutes of Evidence.)Copies of the following letter were submitted to the Committee by Sir Alexander Butterworth with regardto Question No. 4534 on the subject of Arrears of Maintenance-Additional Rolling Stock in Service.North Eastern Railway,Newcastle-upon-Tyne.24th January, 1921.Arrears of Maintenance.Additions to Rolling Stock in Service.Dear Sir Alexander,I understand from you that it has been suggestedthat as the increased first cost of rolling stock i&apos;nservice to which the rates of depreciation for renewalpurposes, at pre-war rates are applied is alreadyswollen by reason of increased wages and prices ofmaterials, the calculation of the renewal charges atprogramme percentages applied to such increasedcosts adequately meets the deferred liability of thecompanies without the addition of 15 per cent, asprovided by the formula upon the amount so cal-culated, or of any other percentage which may beultimately agreed as the cost of carrying out theunexecuted work at the close of control.Regarding units of rolling stock which have beenacquired at maximum prices (if maximum can be con-sidered to have been reached up to now), no doubt thepercentage calculation applied to cost will providethe means for replacement in the future without theadditional percentage supplied under the arrears ofmaintenance arrangement, but the same statementcannot be made regarding any units which have beenacquired during control at less than the &quot; maximum &quot;prices, and, except for this additional percentage,no means exist for providing the companies with anypayment on account of the increase in cost which hastaken place between the date of the acquisition ofnew stock and the present time.You will remember that the advance in prices wasnot very marked in the earlier years of control, itwas in fact almost negligible compared with lateryears.It was, however, and still is, impracticable to devisea scale which would give a graduated amount (onaccount) in respect of additional rolling stockacquired in the various years of control.In considering this question it is perhaps well toremember that the 15 per cent, upon the increasedfirst cost of stock in service is so small a proportionof the whole claim for arrears while the ultimate costof executing the work appears likely to be so muchin excess of the sums the companies have received onaccount of it, that there can be no danger of themargin still unpaid being seriously encroached upon.The arrears of maintenance arrangement, as awhole, was a broad one to enable companies to claimcurrently substantial payments &quot; on Recount,&quot; and,although dealing with many points in detail, it couldscarcely be regarded as entirely and fully coveringall the points that a final, settlement would have totake account of, a notable point, among others, forwhich no provision was made being a lessened pro-duction per man hour.It may be that on a final settlement, arrears inrespect of increased stock in service should only bebrought into account on the basis of the differencebetween the costs at the date of acquisition duringcontrol and the costs ultimately agreed under thearrangement, and, if this be admitted there scarcelyseems to be a case for any present alteration in theformulae regarding the addition of 15 per cent, tothe increased cost of stock in service even if a moreexact method than the present could be devised, such,for instance, as a sliding scale providing for a reduc-tion in the percentage addition according to the yearin which new stock was acquired. But even such anarrangement as this could not be universally applied;as where the increased provision is all expended theexisting formula is, in my view, accurate.Yours faithfully,(Signed)  A. E. Williams.Sir A. Kaye Butterworth.
Submitted by Sir Alexander Butterworth.(Vide Question 4715 in Minutes of Evidence.)25th January, 1921.Departmental Committee on Railway Agreements.Dear Sir,You will remember that at the last sitting of theCommittee a question was put to me by a member ofthe Committeo as to the effect of the 8-hours dayupon the railways from the point of view of thenumber of men employed, and financially. I havemade enquiry, and the best information I can obtainis that the additional number of men required inconsequence of the 8-hours day was approximately76,000, ,and the cost in wages approximately 13,000,000 per annum; the latter figure representsonly the ordinary wages of the additional staff, andis exclusive of any additional payments, such as over-time and Sunday duty.Yours faithfully,(Signed)  A. Kaye Butterworth.E. Twentyman, Esq.,Secretary,Departmental Committee on Railway Agreements.,APPENDIX XXX.Submitted by Sir Alexander Butterworth.(Vide Questions 4944-4947 in Minutes of Evidence.)24th January, 1921.Departmental Committee on Railway Agreements.Bear Mr. Twentyman,&quot;With reference to the request made by the Chair-man at the last sitting of the Committee that I shouldascertain whether it would be possible to obtain forthe Committee any information as to the amount ofthe ultimate claims of the railway companies againstthe Government, I communicated as promised withthe Chairman of the Standing Committee of GeneralManagers, and give you below copy of the reply Ihave received: -&quot; With regard to the point you asked me toconsider with the General Managers as to givingthe Committee some indication of the amount ofany claims that may have to be submitted by theindividual companies at the end of the period ofcontrol, I have been requested to say that onthinking the matter over we have come to theconclusion that it would be impossible for thecompanies to give any idea as to what the pos-sible claims may amount to.   Any estimate, asyou will realise, depends so much upon the trendof prices at the end of the period of control, andso much upon whether the railway companies arehanded back by the Government in a position toearn an adequate net revenue. Both thesematters are in the lap of the gods, and we thinkit will be useless to try to arrive at any estimate,however vague. We do, however, ask that yourefer to the statements that have appeared inthe Press to the effect that the claims of therailway companies may amount to somewhereabout  400,000,000, and to state that any suchstatements have been published without authorityand certainly without any consultation with therailway companies. In fact, so far as we know,none of the companies have taken any stepstowards formulating their individual claims.&quot;Yours faithfully,(Signed) A. Kaye Butterworth.E.
