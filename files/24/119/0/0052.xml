                        REPORT.      A. SUBJECTS  TQ BE PROPOSED TO, THE GOVERNMENTS OP         m DoMiws m hmu v^immsm&apos;n gar         AGENDA FQ^HS&quot; FORifSOOillMTlEETING OF THE         IMPERIAL,  Q&apos;ABIN1;E         i M    .......m ii t+m .T.....-      The following subjects are. In the opinion of the Committee, of first importance5-       1. Renewal  of the Anglo-Japanese Alllanoe ,       8* Naval, Military and Air Defence .       3* Arrangements for securing, a common Imperial          policy in &quot;foreign affairs.       4* Composition, Agenda and Meeting plaoe of the          0cnetitutionaljOoorer-er^os oonoemplated in          Resolution ^&quot;of^Lell^pe^Or^ar &apos;Qonf erence   ,19 it *      In addition  tb the inclusion of the above questions on the proposed Agenda*  the Committee consider it very desirable that, as In the oase of the sessions of the Imperial War Cabinet  in 1917 and 19IB, the opening meetings Bhould b  devoted to statements by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and other Ministers eonoerned, as to the general position on the main Is ues of foreign and Imperial polioy.  Among these states ments,  one on the position in India and its possible developments, in so far as they may affect the general position of India  in the Empire,  might. It is thought, be inoluded with advantage4further,  the Committee feel that, in view of the fact that  the security  of  the Suez Canal and of the Egyptian Air Junction, and the  execution Of the British Mandates In Palestine and Mesopotamia,  are  matters of interest to the Empire as a whole, a  full  statement  should be made on the position in the Hiddle East; If any far-reaching changes of polioy in this region of the world, affecting  the general Imperial position, are contemplated by His Majesty1s  Government in the  near future, the Committee suggest that.  If  circumstances permit,  any final decisions on such questions  should be deferred pending their consideration by  the Imperial Cabinet.                                                       Other......
     Other matters whioh may require discussion are  thefollowing!-    i. Matters arising out of the Oversea Settlement      Conference now sitting,   ii. The Development of Civil Aviation.  iii. The Reports of the imperial Shipping Committee      appointed as the.result of Resolutions 11 and  PA      of the Imperial War Conference, 19IB.   iv. The findings of the Technical Commission appointed      in connection with the Imperial Wireless sohene,    v. Reparation (in particular, the division of any      amount received between the various parts of the      British Empire),   vi. An Imperial Statistical Bureau,  vii. Imperial Patents,     It is possible that the Dominions and India may wish todiscuss subjects which have not been mentioned above.   TheCommittee suggest,4 therefore, that the Dominions and india should be asked forthwith for an expression of their views andfor any Memoranda whioh they are able to send in advance, and  &apos;that they should, at the same time, be informed of the main questions mentioned above, which His Majesty!s Governmentsuggest for dfcscusBion,   India has already suggested forconsideration rtThe Position of British Indians in other partsof the Empire&quot;.          B&apos;.  PAPERS TO BE PREPARED, AND BY WHOM, FOft              TRMSMTSoa0TT0     GOVERNMENTS OF THE              DOMINIONS AND WU jjE?,QRS THE MEETING,     Papers on the four important subjects mentioned above havealready been prepared or are in course of preparation by theDepartments concerned, viz      1,  Kenewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance by the         Foreign Office,      2,  Naval, Military and Air Defence by the Admiralty*         War Office and Air Ministry respectively,      3,  Arrangements for securing a Common Imperial          Policy in foreign affairs by the Colonial Offioe,      4,  Composition, Agenda, and Meeting place of the          Constitutional Conference, by  the Colonial Office,
     It should be noted that the paper on the Composition!Agenda and Meeting place of the Constitutional Conferencecan,&apos; as regards the Agenda, hardly do more at the present stage, pending the meeting of the Imperial Cabinet itself,than indicate a few possible questions for discussion..     Papers on several of the other subjects referred to above are being drawn up by the Departments concerned.     The Committee are of opinion that it is unnecessary tomake any further recommendations in this respect.  They would*however, like to call attention to the following  points,which have received their consideration:-    (a) The date by whioh the Papers should be ready       for despatch.    (b) The extent to which the views expressed in each       Paper are to be regarded as the opinion of His       Ma j esty*s Government.    (c) The sanction necessary before the Papers are       transmitted to the Governments of the&apos;Dominions       and India.     To deal with these points seriatim, the committee recommend: -   (i) That all Papers should, if practicable, be despatched      not later than the 28ch, February, 1981.   (ii) That the Papers need not represent the final views      of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  The benefits to be anti-      cipated from joint discussion would, it is considered,      be lost were the Governments of the Dominions and India      to think that His Majesty^ Government had already      reaohed a final decision.   Consequently, it would      seem best for the Memoranda to be framed in such a      way as to indicate the points requiring discussion      and settlement, and the arguments for and against      alternative policies, without committing His Majesty1B      Government to any final conclusions.  (iii) That, in view of the urgency for the despatch of      the Papers, and of the immediately preceding recom-      mendation, it would be sufficient if the Papers,      as they  are ready, were examined by a small Sub-      Committee of the Cabinet, and, when sanctioned by      them, transmitted forthwith to the Governments of      the Dominions and the  Secretary of State for India,
               0.  MY OTHER ADVANCE ARRAHGrBIIEITTS TO BE                  OP, AS ngggm cEs-mr.-     Under this heading the Committee have considered the f ol-lowing points:-     1. The question of Office Aoconmodation for Represen-       Natives of the Dominions and India.&apos;     On previous occasions accommodation has &quot;been placed at thedisposal of the Oversea Representatives during their stay inLondon in the  Offices of the Cabinet.   The Committee considerit essential that a similar procedure should be followed inthe present instance, and they recommend that the Secretary ofthe Cabinet should make the necessary arrangements.    2. Attendance of Expert Advisers.     It is thought desirable that the representatives of theDominions and  India should have the assistance of their expertadvisers on defence questions and on civil aviation, both of whichmatters seem likely to require a good deal of detailed discussionwith the Departments concerned.   These expert advisers should if                                                    thepossible reach the United Kingdom three weeks before/commencementof the actual  session of the Imperial Cabinet.    3* Arrangement of the Agenda.     &apos;i&apos;he Committee suggest that a week or tv/o before the sessionof the Imperial Cabinet opens* a small Agenda Committee should beappointed to work out details as to the dates, subjects, etc.for the different meetings.     To facilitate lustiness, it will probably be found desirable,after the session has begun, that one or more Sub-Committees ofthe Imperial Cabinet should be appointed, as in the oaBe of the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinets of 1917 and 1018, to dealwith special subjects (e.g. Defence, the question of arrange-ments for securing a comon Imperial policy in foreign affairs,the Constitutional Conference, etc).   Again,&apos; some of the subjects, more particularly those which have been discussed atImperial Conferences in the past, might be more suitably dealt                                                           with.....
with at subsidiary Conferences than at the  meetings  of the imperial cabinet it Be If, though these subjects might subsequently  come up at the Imperial Cabinet for final decision.     4. Secretariat.     The Committee are of opinion that s&amp; the Secretarialarrangements can best be left in the hands  of the Secretary  of  theCabinet, who will, no doubt, endeavour to arrange, aB in  the caseof the British Empire Delegation at Paris and Geneva, for theinclusion of qualified members of the Staffs of  the  OverseaRepresentatives.      5* Composition of the Imperial Cabinet.     Lastly, the Committee would point out  that  the  composition of the Imperial Cabinet itself is a matter  which will need con-sideration before the session begins, with a view to a decisionbeing arrived at as regards both the Home and Oversea Represen-tatives who are to be invited regularly to  attend as members ofthe Imperial Cabinet.
