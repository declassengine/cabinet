Inaccordance with this instruction I  have tho honour to submitherewith my Committee7s Report on these questions.          The petit-:.on condoms the present system cf official &quot;statistics on the biv.;.:1. ground that it is inadequate as afoundation of n&apos;a system of civil intelligence&quot;.   It allegescertain general and specific defects in the present system,among which are the absence of general supervision of NationalStatistics, the lack of cc-erdination between Departments, theabsence of adequate compulsory powers and inadequate financial provision for essential statistics.   The expressed aim of the;;Petition is tho appointment&apos; of a Royal Commission to investigate                                                 c * o u &quot;t 1&quot;J.G
the whole position in regard to official statistics but the under-dying object of the Petition appears to bo to pleadfor the creation of a Central Statistical Department.        Thoso general charges and the suge.estod remedy arcexamined in paragraphs 5-31 of our Report.   Wo find thattho charges arc based on a misapprehension of tho presentfunctions of Government with regard to statistics, as  a resultof which the Petitioners hare boon led to ignore tho limit-ations which administrative and financial considerations mustimpose on offioial statistics unless and until it is accepted as an obligation of Government to provide statistical  infonn-ation on all subjects without reference to its utility fortho purposes of Government, to tho value of tho information inrelation to its post or to tho nature of tho enquiries neo-cssary in each case,   Even if the present timo were opportune for the creation; of a new Government Department, tho estab-lishmont of a Central Statistical Qffioo could remove  none oftho limitations at present imposed on the scopo of official statistics.   for the so reasons we reaommend that no&apos; enquiry.should be hold into the system of official-statistics.        We have found, however, in tho course, of our enquiriesthat the present machinory for the co-ordination of official statistics is capable of improvement, and wo recommend to thisend, tho establishment of a  ermanont Consultativo Committeeon official statistics,   fho constitution and functions pro-posed for the Committee, which are set out in detail inparagraphs 33-36 of our Report; may bo summarised as undor:-        (1) The Committee should bo set up by the Cabinet as            a permanent organisation but without executive            duties.        (2) The principal Departments should each havo one            representative on the Committee.                                             .,,rThe :
        Tho Scottish and Irish Departments should in each        case have 3 representatives.        The Chairman should be olocted by tho Committee, and        tho Secretary appointed but not necessarily provided        by the Treasury.   (3)  The Committee should bo required to advise on any        statistical question submitted to it by a Department        and should have power to initiate discussion on any        question affecting official statistics and to make        recommendations thereon to the Department concerned        through its n^resentative on the Committee.    Tho        Committee should however have no powor to make        recommendations with reference to departmental        statistics to any Central Authoritya        While it will probably be necessary for the Cabinetto take notico only of the speoific recommendations of theCommittee as summarised above, and while the broad principles on which we have arrived at our conclusions are contained inthe body of the Report itsolf, It may be thought desirable that not only the Roport, but tho Appendix thereto^, whioh deals                  cin some detail with the particular criticisms raised in the petition, should be published as a Stationery Office t&amp;f&amp;xcation.   It appears to my Committee to be pro cable that sucha course would clear up many obscurities in regard to thepresent position of official statistics..

(3) The Petition referred to in the Cabinet Minute          quoted  above was  prepared  by a Committee of the Royal Statistic-          al  Society, signed by a number of statisticians, business men          and others, and presented  to His Majesty1s Government in          November  1919*   It calls  attention to certain alleged  defects          in  the  statistics published by Government Departments,  and          requests  that  a Royal Commission or Parliamentary Committee          should  forthwith  be appointed &quot;to enquire into the methods of1          the collection and presentation of public statistics and to          report  on the  means of  improvement&quot;.                 (4) The proposal to constitute a Permanent Consultative          Committee on official  statistics was made in the first  Instance                                                                 by                                     a*l*a
lifetoy a Conference of official statisticians summoned by thePresident of the Board of Trade to Consider the questions raised in the Petition., and was embodied in a memorandum                                             xpresented to the Cabinet by Sir Robert Home.    The specific proposals referred to the present Committee are in fact thoseput forward in Sir Robert Horne&apos;s memorandum, but in order todOmply with the instructions of the Cabinet to report on thegeneral question, we have found ii necessary to examine thewhole subject raised by the Petition..   The first part ofthis Report deals accordingly with the issues raised by the petition and with the need for enquiry into them, whiles  .  \the second part deals with the proposal to appoint apermanent Consultative Committee to promote co-ordination in the Statistical work of Government departments on theassumption that the Government will find it inadvisable,either&apos; in the circumstances of the times, or for wider-reasons, to grant the Enquiry for which the Petitionersask, we recommend that such a Consultative Committee shouldbe set up and we make proposals as to its constitution and functions ,c                            PART  I.   THE PROPOSAL FOR AN ENQUIRY INTO OFFICIAL STATISTICS,       (5)   In representing that there is an urgent need forthe re-organisation of the present system of official statistics &quot;as the foundation of a proper system of civilintelligence&quot;  (par, 1) and in stating that &quot;it  is generally recognised *.,     . **, * that off icial statistics as atpresent collected and published are inadequate  *v.^....... *for  the purposes they should serve&quot; the  Petition raisesan important  issue, by taking for granted the responsibilityof Government with regard to statistics covering the whole
life and activities of the community. That proposition has never been accepted in this country and no provision is therefore made by the national machinery of administration to discharge such an obligation. But, while this is the case, it cannot be said on the other hand, that official statistics in the United Kingdom are a mere by-product of departmental activities, or are collected and used solely for official purposes. Certain statistics officially published fall within these categories, but other statistics, which serve no direct purpose of State administration, are collected or compiled and issued to meet public demands for information touching the progress and welfare of the Community.

(6) The fact is that the whole body of official statistics is the product of evolution. It falls into two main branches, the constituent parts of which, having regard to their origin and use, may be briefly called administrative and informative statistics. But the informative character of official statistics as a whole has tended to become more marked. On the one hand many statistics originating in, and still serving, governmental or departmental necessities, have been developed as possibilities of usefulness outside the scope of departmental work have revealed themselves. On the other hand various statistics, not required for any existing administrative purpose, have been prepared in response to special or general demands, when supported by evidence of their need for purposes sufficiently important to warrant Government recognition and assistance. 
    (7)  The provision of informative statistics hasnaturally been subject at all times to certain conditions,of which the following are the chief    (i)   the purpose to be served must be recognised          to be of definite national value;    (ii)  the cost must be reasonable in relation to          that purpose,, icOt it must be such as          Parliament mkf prcnerly be asked to sanqtion,          regard being had to the general financial          position of the countryJ    (iii) the enquiries necessary to the collection of          the material for the desired statistics must          not be such as to excite Irritation and          resentment among those from whom the information          has to be obtained:  and, in close relation to          this point,    (iv)  if compulsory powers are required, these          powers must be&quot;such as Parliament may be          willing to grant; and the action to be taken          under them such as Parliament will approve *         These considerations have lost none of their force to-day.   Indeed, so far as cost is concerned,,  their importance is enhanced by the present financial situation,while the insistence by Parliament upon its general powerof control has been very recently emphasised by the  .amendments made in the Census Bill of 1920.    (8)  Within the limitations thus enforced a large body of official statistics has grown up, and the statement in paragraph (7) of the Petition that &quot;there is hardlyany reform, financial, social or commercial, for whichadequate information can be supplied with our presentmachinery., and the same is true with regard to changes which have been proposed in our commercial relations  withthe overseas Dominions and foreign countries&quot;, appearsto us wholly unjustifiable.   There can be no doubt that existing official statistics, if properly interpreted,supply material of the greatest value for many importantpurposes, while, as regards the future,, we are convincedthat the officials who are responsible for the production                      -4-                            of

Indeed, so far as cost is concerned^  their importance is enhanced by the present financial situation,while the insistence by Parliament upon its general powerof control has been very recently emphasised by the  .amendments made in the Census Bill of 1920.    (8)  Within the limitations thus enforced a large body of official statistics has grown up, and the statement in paragraph (7) of the Petition that &quot;there is hardlyany reform, financial, social or commercial, for whichadequate information can be supplied with our presentmachinery.; and the same is true with regard to changes which have been proposed in our commercial relations withthe overseas Dominions and foreign countries&quot;, appearsto us wholly unjustifiable *   There can be no doubt that existing official statistics, if properly interpreted,supply material of the greatest value for many importantpurposes, while, as regards the future,, we are convincedthat the officials who are responsible for the production                      -4-                            of
of such statistics are far from being content with what has been accomplished..  It may be observed, moreover,that the interest of Government Departments generally in statistics h^s been greatly stimulated by the depend-ence of the country on statistic? for much importantinformation during the $ar*    (9)  It is true that in some respects official statistics pre not at present as complete as they were some years ago.   This is due solely to the disturbancecaused by the war, when under the stress of imperativenecessity, many services had %4 be suspended cr postponed3The departments affected have not, however^ been inactive      *                          i&apos;        itin the matter, and the Committee feel justified in expressing the opinion that the service.of nationalstatistics will, subject to financial considerations,not merely be restored to the pre-war standard bypresent or contemplated arrangements, but be placed ona substantially higher level*  Indeed there have beenimportant additions to the body of public statisticssince the war, a notable example of which is furnished by the valuable railway statistics now published bythe Ministry of Transport,.    ,                                  !    (10) The Petitioners, however,, appear to regard thepresent system as entirely unsatisfactory, and ask for a comprehensive enquiry into the whole subject by a RoyalCommission or Parliamentary Committee.   They do not definitely put forward any scheme of reform, but theylay much emphasis on the absence of any centralsupervision, and in paragraph 5 of the petition they call attention to proposals which have been put before the           )                                               . Royal
Royal Statistical Society by various persons,  during thepast forty years, that there should be a Central StatisticalOffice for the United Kin.3d0.nu   We feel entitled to assume,therefore, that the Petitioners regard this as the true remedy,and we accordingly think it desirable to give  full consider-,ation to the proposal, both in its constitutional aspectand as a means of rectifying the various shortcomings whichthe Petitioners allege to exists    (xl)  A central statistical office for the UnitedKingdom would in effect assume responsibility  for allofficial statistics,   Whatever its title, it  would be aGovernment Department, dependent on Parliament for its authority - which must necessarily be wide - and answerable to Parliament, through a Minister, for the manner in which its responsibilities had been discharged^   The present doesnot appear to be an opportune time to propose  the creationof a new department which must impose an extra charge uponpublic fundsi   We recognise however that this considerationmay not have permanently the same importance as it hasto-day, and we have accordingly directed ourselves to an examination of the question in its permanent aspects, andespecially to the constitutional Issues **Mc!h  H raises..These issues may conveniently be examined in connection                                         iwith the first of the six causes of defects in the presentsystem which are set out in paragraph 3 of the Petition.which we now proceed to consider*    wNo genera 1 supervision of national statistics as a             whole&quot;.,    (12)  The statement that there is no general supervision of national statistics as a whole  is true*                                                 Each
Each group of official statistics is produced by one specific department. This is true both of administrative and informative statistics.

(13) Administrative statistics are largely technical in the sense that they arise out of specialised problems of administration in regard to which the departmental officers possess export knowledge of the material with which they deal and of the nature of and limitations on the statistics which they produce from it. Informative statistics, although not primarily produced for administrative ends, are similarly prepared by specific Government departments, often as an outcome of specialised administrative machinery. For those reasons it is doubtful whether, on balance, the institution of central supervision would lead to greater statistical efficiency. It would, however, certainly give rise to constitutional difficulties. A Minister is responsible to Parliament for the special branch of administration with which his department deals. While the existence of a central statistical office would not interfere with the statistics prepared by his department for internal use and for the purpose of reporting upon and illustrating his administrative activities to Parliament, such an office might consider it desirable for national informative purposes to secure extended or additional statistics, which would impose upon that Minister&apos;s officers an additional burden which he might regard as unreasonable or which would, without his agreement, make an addition to the cost of his Department which he must defend in Parliament. It is clearly inadvisable to set up any machinery which might load to results of this kind.

 
(14) It may be argued that there is a wide field for the exercise of a valuable function by a central office of statistics for the United Kingdom, without radical interference with the existing organisation of departmental statistics. It is frequently said in effect, that certain subjects are dealt with in sectional aspects only by the departments charged with relative administrative functions and that as a consequence it is impossible to obtain a complete statistical conspectus of these subjects. A central office of statistics would, it is said, provide machinery for the reconciliation of partial and possibly disconnected statistics of this nature, or for the presentation of a complete picture drawn from all the information available. In this, so to speak, "neutral"  field it is suggested that valuable work both waits and demands to be done. Examples of such subjects are possibly the national income, national wealth, the division of the product of any industry between the agents of production, the full treatment of such units as shipping, etc. All this may be true. But so far as comprehensive statistics of this nature are not required for administrative purposes, they could only, in our opinion, be provided subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 7 above. Even where those conditions were satisfied, we do not consider that the work could be performed by a central office without interfering radically with the existing organisation of departmental statistics. Hence the establishment of a central office, even were it restricted to these limited functions, would raise all the constitutional objections referred to in the proceding paragraphs. Difficulties at present facing the private statisticians in the so called "neutral" field of statistics would moreover largely be solved by the




the improved co-ordination of departmental statistics with which we deal later.

(15) These considerations are supported by an examination of the recommendations of the Official Statistics Committee appointed in 1877, and embodied in their Third Report (Parliamentary Paper 38 of 1881). This Committee was appointed to consider defects then existing in the organisation and scope  of official statistics, and their Third Report is specifically devoted to the examination of  the best organisation "for the future conduct  and control of official statistics".

(16) The circumstances in which that Committee was set up are described in the Treasury Minute of appointment, which, in graphic phrases, depicts the chaotic conditions which, it is said, at that time pervaded the whole body of official statistics. Those, certainly, are not the present conditions, and we should have found it unnecessary to examine the Committee&apos;s conclusions at length, despite the fact that those include the institution of a system of central statistical control, but for the evident impression in the minds of the Petitioners that the condition of national statistics was very much the same in 1919 as it was admitted to be in 1877.

(17) While the available records show that the proposals of the Committee were carefully examined by the   Government and to some extent adopted, it is significant that the two main recommendations made by the  Committee were never put into force. In the first of these it was proposed that while each of the "statistically important" departments should continue to be responsible for its own statistics, a small central statistical
N-Btatifltloal--dopar^mcri^^ should bo sot up, with functions such as the preparation.-^ of annual abstracts,  the compilation of an annual index, and tho editing of a  miscellaneous volume containing statistical returns from the smaller departments.   Tho second of the prihcipal recommendations was that after a preliminary survey  of tho statistics of all departments, with a view to BOcuring uniformity of system, a small permanent Board or Commission should ho appointed,  to carry on tho supervision of statistics and to doouro a continuance of order  and harmony in tho general body of returns presented to  Parliament0      (18) We may mention In passing that an official of groat-experience and  authority,  IIRO T*Ho Parror,  Secretary to  tho Board of Trade,  dissented from thoso  recommendations, and in the  course of  his  observations made  a statement which is  A3 profoundly  true to-day&quot;as when  It was written,  and is spocially significant in tho consideration  of the issues raised by the  Petition.     In discussing the  defects in  official statistics  then existing^ ho pointed  out that it wa3 important to  recognise the causes,  aniong Y/hich he  included  differences in tho laws,  customs  and circumstances under whioh the different^statistics are collocted by  different  departments and in different parts  of  the  Kingdom&quot;*    He wont  on to say,  aftermentioning  certain  oxamples, &quot;those  differences and many others  lie  doep  in  the  laws and  customs  of tho  threeKingdoms, and it  would  be sanguine to hope that theycould be  removed  in order to render&apos;statistical recordsuniform.   Human  life and habits  can  seldom be  altorod in                                                  order
Order to make records perfect&quot;.     (19) The rocommendation to establish a diaall central statistical department, which,  if it had beon adopted,would have amounted to little more than the transfer ofcertain  activities of the Board of Trade to a new department, was never brought into effect.   The Baardof Trade objected to the proposal and the then FirstLord and Chancellor of tho Exchequer (Mr. Gladstone)feared that such a central department might extend its functions beyond tho limits required at onoe by economy and expediency.     (20) It is df at least historical importance inthis1 connection that the Statistical Enquiry committee referred to in the next paragraph oame to the conclusionthat the Central Statistical Office if established mastovershadow all the other statistical offiocs, if friction and duplication were to be avoided, and must become&quot; thechief compiling as well as the supervising office.Accordingly, they considered that it should take overthe whole of the statistical work of the CommercialDepartment of the B-sard of Trade; but, having arrivedat this  conclusion, they appear te have doubted whetherthe Commercial Department would be able to dischargeits duties, as a commercial department, without thefacilities whioh its command of statistics secured. Theyraised this Question but offered no solution.     (21) There is no question, however, but that theOfficial Statistics Committee, in recommending, after Vpreliminary enquiry into the more important Departmental                                            Statistics,
c-  &apos;  335Statistics,  the establishment of a permanent Board orCoomission to supervise suoh Statistics, did contemplatothe possibility of some measure of forual supervision ofthe statistical work of the Dcpaxtnents. ,  Had no attemptboon made to explore this possibility,  we should havehesitated, in spite of the strong a priori considerations to which we have roforrod, to&apos;differ  from such an authoritative body as was this Committee.   T7e find,however, that a Committee, of the oharacter and with thefunctions recommended, was appointed  by the Treasuryimmediately  on the receipt of the Third Report, under the title  of the Statistical Enquiry Coned-tec   ThisCommittee proceeds^ to enquire into the Statistics  of several  apartments and to submit schemes for  theirimprovement  to the Treasury.   Great  difficulty wasevidently experienced  in  inducing certain Lopartmento toaccept the recommendations of the Enquiry Oowhrittee, andin their  second and final Report to  tho Trearufy,  thisCommittee recommended, presumably as  a result  of  theire&amp;porience,  that  the  appointment of  a formal SupervisingCommittee or Comnjission  should  be postponed,  and  that thebest course  would seem to be to  &quot;orbce^d tentatively andinformally..   *vith this  view we  ore  in full agreement.It appears  to us  that the arguments  adjust tho  creationof formal machinery of control  hsve  boon strengthene:i  b;?the development  of government in recent years  and by thespecialisation of administrative  functions  v*;ioh  has inevitably resulted.      (r,Z)  &quot;7b now proceed to  consider the other five, and more specific, causes of defects in ofiiciaJ  statis- tico which  are allege;!, in paragraph r6 of the petition,.                                                 &quot;Lack/
     &quot;Lack of co-operation between the differentDopartments except in sojfar as^,the majt be, arrangeft                on a voluntary basis&quot;.     (23) The specific&quot;iustanoe given of a defect alleged to result from laok of co-operation, namely that theoensus of population, the census of nroduotion, and the census of wages are not collated, is discussed in theAppendix.   On the general point, v/e believe that thedesirability of oo-operation between Departments in orderto harmonise thoir statistics is increasingly recognised,but that more satisfactory results would be attained ifdefinite machinery were provided for the purpose.   Inthe Second part of this Keport we accordingly recommendthat a permanent consultative Committee should boestablished.   The oo-operation which we hope thus tosecure would however be voluntary.   &apos;re cannot accent theview, which is implied in paragraph 3 of the Petition,that co-opera*bion will only be effective if it iscompulsory.     &quot;Compulsory Powers are too few and too seldom                        ajrpji^ed^.     (. 4) This, in our judgment, is primarily a matter for Parliament.   It is probable that the Departments whiohare responsible for considerable bodies of statistics wouldin some  oases rogard the existence of greater compulsory powers as  an advantage *   It is  certain, however, that parliament would not grant general powers of the kind,and this applies with  as groat force to any central statistical office that might be set up, as it does to existing departments.   Strong evidence on this point isafforded by the terms  of  the Census Aot, 1920, unaer which the  prior  and specific approval  of Parliament  is requiredto the exercise of  the general powers conferred by the  Act.                                                    Even/
Even after the establishment of a central office, therefore,parliamentary approval would&quot; still bo required for theacquisition of the powers in question.     (25) It would, moreover, be sanguine to assume that Parliament would roadily grant further compulsory powers such as a Central Statistical Office, with itsattention fixed upon tho statistical asneot of affairs,might be expected to desire *   The enquiries which wehave made in regard to the specific dofeots alleged bythe Petition show that, in more than one importantbranch of statistical knowledge, members of the public have been reluctant to make returns that they fearedmight bo used to their detriment, and Parliament hassupported thom0   This attitude may not be welcome to thestatistician, but its existence is not to be deniedo          Defe ativs  upervisionjDt t,he JJO liection                       of S tat is ti os   t e^     (26) It is difficult to deal with a vague complaint of this kind.   In certain oases a greater degree of supervision of the collection of statistics could doubt-less bo achieved by the employment of additional inspect-ing and headquarters staff.   It is in each case a ques-tion of measuring the improvement which can be attainedagainst the additional cost involved, and we believethat Departments generally are fully alive to thoimnortanee of exercising such supervision as can boeffected at a reasonable cost.   In their inference tothe class and remuneration of persons employed, thepetitioners make soecial mention of the census.   So faras this is a general matter rather than a uarticularcomplaint, it is connecter) with the further complaint                                                   as
as to tho absonoa of adequate financial provision forthe statistical services, and will be considered later.We are not, however, aware of any oohepicuous short4-bOming in the delivery and collection of oensufc schedulesat the last oensus.   vJe understand/what efforts arsmade to secure the best type of enumerator within thelimits of the funds available for the purpose, andthat special steps are being taken to this end inconnection with the 19 1 Census.  &quot;Antiquated and anomalous legislation such as thatwhich prescribes different financial years for various                       annual returnsr&quot;      (87)  In renewing the complaint that differentstatistical years are followed for difforent purposes,the  Petitioners  raise an issue whose implications go  far beyond statistics.   The primary purpose of  legislation is the administration of the  oountry.    Where  thispurpose  is most  effectively  served by the  dates  prescribed in  existing  statutes the introduction  of new legislation of the kind  desired by  the Petitioners  -  considerable in volume and perhaps  contentious  -  requires  strongjustification.    Large  questions  affecting the  gnneralmachinery of government are  involved,  to whioh  the  stat-istioal  considerations  in the minds  of the Petitionersmust Inevitably be  subordinate^.    It  is however desirablethat departments should oonsider  how far  a greateruniformity can  be sooured  in this resoeot, and  that,  assuitable occasions  offer,  they should  take steps toremove  any avoidable  discrepancies.    Action along these lines, would in our view,  naturally follow on theestabllshmant&quot; of oo-ordinating maohinery of the kind suggested in the second part of this Report.                                             Inadequate/
     Inadequate finaneial provision for the collection.                of jp sojitial Statist3ioa.     (28) The immediate question hero  is the definition of &quot;essential statistics.&quot;   The statistical enthusiastwill give a much wider meaning to the  tern essential thanthe Government, whioh has to consider  the attitude of the taxpayer and all the other demands made upon the publicpurse.   This point has already been dealt with inparagraph 7.   The statistician must convince theGovernment of the day that the extensions of official statistics whioh he desires are sufficiently valuable tojustify the increased expenditure involved, and theGovernment must satisfy public opinion as expressed byParliament.   It must be recognised that public opinionat the oresent time is by no means favourable to increased expenditure on Statistics.     (29) This point is aptly illustrated by the Reportof the Committee of Enquiry into the work of the hJraploy-ment Exchanges which has just been issued.   Thatrepresentative Committee, of which an ex-Cabinet minister was the  Chairman, dealt inter alia with &quot;Forms and statistics&quot;, and while recognising &quot;that a GovernmentDepartment  is bound to keep a careful record of its activities  in order to supply information wMoh theGovernment, the House of Commons or the Public may atany time require&quot;stated its belief that in the province of administration which they were considering the statistical returns could safely be reduced  In volume,and that requirements would be mot if  the: e were  almost wholly confined to  statistics required  fov actuarial  andadministrative purposes.    It is probable  that thePetitioners would not conour  In  this view,   butit is at least equally probable                                 that/
 that  it  reflects  the  attitude  which  par] Lament  right take  towards  the  financial  provision for new  statistical services.          tipeoJ.fio  defects alleged  in the Petition.    (30)   Paragraph 5  of  the  Petition mentions eight specific  defects  which are  attributed to the general causes considered  above.  These  ire  full;/ examined in the appendix  to the present  report,  but  it vill be  convenient to  summarise  here  the results.   The  allegations as to defects may be divided into  four categories.  In the first category are  Kailvay  statistics,, where the position has entirely  changed  since the petition was framed..  In the second category may  be placed &quot;defects&quot; Wiich are due solely to delay caused by the war in the - reparation and development of  statistics.   In some of these cases the &quot;defects&quot; are  already in process of being made good; in  others former enquiries cannot profitably be repeated until stable conditions are  reached,  and the results of any enquiries which might be  instituted at the moment would be obsolete  before they could be completed..  In the third category are certain statistics which admittedly are not being produced; tue reasons for their absence arenot however those  suggested  in the letition, but are among those discussed above;, for instance,  the necessaryenquiries might give rise to \ idespread suspicion; orthe action desired by the petitioners would involve increase of staffs and a considerable addition to expenditure.   In the fourth category are included cases in whioh the information desired, however intresting to students of bocial conditions, does not appear.to be.of national importance,  and should be the sublet ofprivate investigation.
            Smpmary and Conclusions.   (31)  The main points put forward in the Petitiony  now be summarised as followsi-    1.  The present system Of Official ijialtistios is inadequate as the inundation&apos;6f &quot;a system Of civil intelligence&quot;.     8.   The chief reason for this inadequacy is the absence cf a system of &quot;general supervision of national statistics as a whole&quot;.  The suggested remedy for this appears to be the establishment of a &quot;Central Statistical Gffixse&quot; to exercise &quot;a permanent statistical control&quot; oveijffche Departments.    3.    Other general defeots of the present system are that different departments are not compelled to co-ordinate their statistics (although they may do so voluntarily). that important statistics are not obtained beoSttse of the absenoe oi compulsory powers,  that certain existing statistics are not oolleoted with proper c-arc,  or axe not on a proper basis.,  and that the finanoial provision is not adequate fcr the collection of all &quot;essential&quot; statistics.     4.  A Royal Commission or Parliamentary Committee should t erefore be appointed immediately to  enquire into the existing methods of the  collection and presentation of Public otatistios.       We have ftund that the underlying object oftx.&apos;e  ietitioners,  aamely,  that a central statistical  department  should be  created with overriding authorityever other departments,  charged with the  duty  if &quot;&quot;supplying the  publio with statistical information notonly in relation to the departmental activities if thV                                      Government
 Government,  but  on  all  questions  of general  interest, would  both extend the functions of Government and alter the constitutional  balance  of  Governmental machinery.         On the desirability  cf extending the functions of Government, we have  not  felt called upon  to  express an opinion,  but  we  have pointed out that the provision of official  statistics other than those essential  for administrative purposes 2r.as  been  in the past subjected to well defined limitations^ deteiminod by the national value of tha statistics required,  the cost of the collection and compilation, the  nature of the enquiries neoessary, and the views cf the  public as expressed in parliamentary Within these limitations a large  and valuable body of official statistics has grown  up, and we are confident that when the dislocation caused  by the v,ar has been overcome official statistics will be raised  by existing or projected arrangements to a materially higher standard than was attained before the war.   Ivloreover an examination of the specific  defects mentioned by the Petitioners has convinced us that the allegations put forward against the system cf national  statistics as  it stands to-day are,, broadly speaking, not established,,        We are satisfied that while the existenoo of a Central statistical Office would give rise to constitutional and other difficulties it would do little If anything to remove the conditions which at present limit theproduction of national statistics.   These conditions would apply to a  eentral offioe no less strictly than they do to existing departments.          We recommend accordingly that the Petitioners                                           * be informed that  in the  opinion of His iviajestj^s Government no case- exists for an enquiry, whether by a                                        Royallo -
Royal Commission or a Parliamantary&quot;t3ommiftee, into thepresent method of collection and presentation of official statistics.                   PART JJ^  OOWXNES SOk TMCO^ORBIliATIOn Oi? oyjIOIuI. STATIST 10a,     C3fe)  In the first part of this ^evort we haveexpressed the opinion that a higher level of effioienoyis attainable in official statistics through the medium ofthe present departmental machinery and within the limitsthat practical considerations impose,  ,.e think that thisend can be achieved by a system of regular consultation between the statistical officers of the different departments in a committee enjoying an official status, with power to make zeeommendatlout to the Jepartments through their representatives, and so to secure that purelystatistical considerations will be given due weight bythe administrative heads of Departments in deoiding onthe form and nature of1 the statistics they publish..     (35)  Ye recommend-accordingly that for the purposeof ensuring more effective co-operation and co-ordination between the different departments in their&apos; statisticalwork, a permanent consultative Committee of statisticalofficers should be established^     (34)   V.re agree with the view put forward by thei-resident of the Board of Trade (C.P.1217) of 4th Hay, 1920)that the existence of a Committee for consultation and mutual assistance will secure mott of the real advantages ,of centralisation while avoiding its disadvantages.  Weare, ho\ever,  of opinion that no executive function or                                            duties
duties should he assignee, to it.  It should, therefore,have no power to make recommendations with reference to official statistics to a central authority (whether theCabinet or the Treasury) or to receive direct representa-tions from non-official statisticians or organisations,since,  in either case, the exercise of such powers mighthave the effect of imposing   .. the views cf the Committee ondepartments,  in that event the committee would cease to he a gathering of statistical experts and would become(contrary to our intention)  a body representing theadministrative heads of the departments.  \7e do not contemplate that the Committee should undertake anyadministrative responsibility for the arrangement orrearrangement of official statistics,  or take the placeof any departmental machinery necessary for that purpose.     (35)   T;re accordingly recommend that the constitution and powers should be as under     (1)  The Com-dttee should be st up by the Cabinet         as a permanent organisation.     (2)  The Com ittee should consist of members of         selected Government Departments nominated by         those departments,  acting under a Chairman         elected by the committee,  with a secretary         appointed (but not  necessarily provided)  by         the Treasury.     (3)  The following ^Departments should each have         one representative  on the Committee - Treasury,         Admiralty,  /J.r Ministry,  Ministry of Agriculture         and Fisheries,  Board of Customs and Excise,         Board of Education,  Home Office,  Board of         inland Revenue,  Medical Research Council,        Ministry of Labour,  Ministry of Health,  Ministry         of pensions,  General Register office, Department
     if scientific  and industrial Research. BourtL of     Trade,  Ministry $f Transport, War Office,     Government  Actuary&apos;s Department.  The Scottish     and Irish Departments  should each have 3     Representatives.  It should he provided that     any representative, with  the permission of     the chairman,  might he accompanied at any meeting     of the  committee by ether departmental officers.(4)   The Government should  bring to the notice of     all Government Departments publishing     statistics  the desirability of informing the     Committee of any proposed ohangeo in the form     er scope  of those statistics.(5)   The committee  should be empowered to initiate     discussion  upon any question affecting official     statistics, and at its discretion to consult     any person  or  organisation whose advice and     opinion it  desired to  take on any question under     consideration.  Any person or body cf persons     desiring  to make representations upon offioial     statistics  should,  however, not be ^iven a     right cf  direot approach  to the Committee, but     should, as  heretofore,  submit their views to     the Government Department consumed.(6)   The committee  should he required to consider     and advise  upott any statistical matter referred     to it by  a  Government  Department(7)   If the  Committee should desire io make any                                    \     recommendations upen official statiatics to any     Department,  it should  be  empowered to do so     either  through the representative of that     department  upon thjfe Committee, or, if the     department  be  not represented on the Committee,
          by direct communication with the department.     (8)  An annual report of the proceedings of the          Committee should be submitted to the Cabinet          Secretariat for circulation to the Government          Departments interested.                 .. *               Index to pfficial statistics *     (36)  We have been impressed in the course of our deliberations by. the fact that there exists nothing inthe nature of a comprehensive index to the numerousvolumes of a statistical character, or containingstatistics,  which are published by the various GovernmentDepartments.  We think that such an index would be ofgreat value to ell persons who have occasion to useOfficial statistics, ana we believe th^t if such an index * existed it roula do much to aispel many of themisapprehensions as to official statistics which formthe basis of some at least of the allegations containedin the petition.      We think that the establishment of a consulta-tive committee,  as proposed above,  would afiord a convenient opportunity for the preparation of such an.inaex which should be, a3 far as possible,  of an explanatory character,  ve recommend, therefore, thaton the appointment of the Committee the various government Departments should be-invited to supply tothe secretary a list of their statistical publications,cr r posts containing statistics,  with brief explanatorynotes,  suitable for publication, of the statisticscontained in sucli volumes and that the committee should
be chargeu with the duty of editing ana preparing forthe press an annual volume which would bring together in convenient form the information supplied by all thedepartments,  We think that such a volume should beissued as a stationery office publication.
