It would alsocreate a legitimate grievance in the minds of allcompetitors, and would be strongly resented by ourcontractors.   If furnishes an inducement to King&apos;s RollFirms to quote a high price in tho first Instance, knowingthat thoy may have a second opportunity of gebting thecontractsThese principles have always been tho policy of thoAdmiralty, and were very strongly assertod by Mr. MoKenna in1908 when ho was First Lord of the Admiralty, in a minutewheroin he expressed his opposition to tho principle ofbargaining as being contrary to the policy recommended atleast in cases of competitive tenders by a Committee in theHouse of Commons *Moreover the Cabinet instruction does not make itclear whether, in the event of the lowest firm on the KingURoll refusing the price offered, the next lowest is to bogiven tho same opportunity - and so on*Lastly, apart from the principle involved, theadoption of tho instruction would entail serious delay anda risk of losing the market when onee the tenders have beenlodged in office, besides increased correspondence andstaff *The Admiralty strongly urge therefore that the decisionarrived at by the Cabinet on the 28th January (Conclusion 2)be reconsidered, or at least suspended until the Treasuryhave taken the advice of such a body as the Federation ofBritish Industries in regard to it.(Intlld.)
