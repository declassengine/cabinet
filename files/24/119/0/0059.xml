CABINET.

PROPOSED DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT.

Copy of letter from the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party to the Prime Minister.



                                                    HOUSE OF COMMONS.



                                                       (Undated).



Dear Prime Minister,

         The Officers of the Parliamentary Labour Party have been conferring with the Joint Committee (representing the National Executive of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress) on Unemployment, which was responsible for the drafting of the Resolution passed at our Labour Conference on the 27th ultime, a copy of which Resolution has, I understand, been sent to you.

It will probably be necessary for the Parliamentary Party to move an amendment on unemployment to the Address in answer to the King&apos;s Speech, and in this event the Party will desire to have a full discussion covering two days. I thought it might be desirable to let you know this in good time in order that arrangements can be made accordingly.



                                                              Yours sincerely,

                                                               (Signed) ?. ADAMSON

                                                                     (H.S.L.)



Rt. Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.
