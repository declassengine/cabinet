               Kr BA1FCUR explained  that; the ,Inter-Departmental confer-           ence had been  summoned  to  consider  certain queotions specified           in  the Agenda  (C.P.-2513)  fortbe forthcoming meeting of the           Council of thr- league of Nations,  A number of these ques-           tions  related  to the appointment of representatives cn certain           Committees to be set up by the Council of the League in pursU-           ance o^ Resolutions passed by the Assembly in Decerrbor.., 1920,           It was most important that Great Britain should be directly          represented on all important Committees,  and,before asking          the Cabinet for definite instructions,  ha had felt it  desir-          able td have  a me-ting of Departmental representatives  with          a view to  ascertaining the opinions  of the Departments  inter-          ested in the  various questions.  It  should be borne in  mind          that the French Government  were now  taking the League of          Nations very  seriously.  The  policy  of  that Government  aimed          at utilising  to the  fullest possible extent the machinery of          the  League  of Nations  in order to advance  French interests.          A special League  of  Nations Department  had been set up  in P&apos;lris          and  it was  v-ry undesirable that Great  Britain should fall              Franc e          behindyin her relations  with  the League.MITTEE ON      (1) As an  illustration of this  tendency, Mr BALFOURIBMENTSTHE        instanced the nomination of ft..  Viviani  as  th*- French Repre-2NANT.          sentative on  the  Committee  on Amendments tc the Covenant.          M. Viviani  was  an ex French Premier  and might easily be          Premier again in  the near  future..  He was  one of the cost          influential speakers at  the meeting  of  the  Assembly at          Geneva,  and he  would doubtless, exercise considerable influ-          ence on the Committee,   A suggestion had been made  that the          representative  of Great  Britain on this Committee should be          a distincruishPd lawyer,  such  as an ax-Lord Chancellor; &apos; but          he  (Mr B^LPCUR)  felt that the British Representative should          preferably  be some p rsort with a ^ery wide and intimate          knowledge of  the  higher  diplomacy.and of&quot;the present          tendencies  in international politics.                                     -1-
     In this c onnec tion, ref erence was made to the great dif-difficulties which might arise at any moment with America over this particular question, and to the need for the most careful handling of the situation if, as was to he hoped, Americawas ultimately to he induced to accept the Covenant, with or without modifications.    SIR BYRE CRCVE felt sure that Lord  Curzon would endorse the views just expressed hy Mrt Balfour, and in particular                 su/?p:estionwould favour the         that the British Representative.on this Committee should he a person possessing politicalrather than, legal qualifications.   He remirded the conference that on this issue America was divided between those who desired to scrap the Covenant altogether and possibly substi-tute some very different scheme for it, and those who would accept the Covenant substantially in its presents-form providedthat Article X was deleted.   The latter paz?ty was gainingground, and possibly the best course to adopt might be to wait for the new American Government to formulate definite proposals, and, in the meanwhile, for the Council of theLeague to confine itself to recommending the adoption of asfew and as non-contentious amendments to the Covenant aspossible.   It was clear that the Americans would regard withthe utmost suspicion, and would probably reject, any proposed amendments of substance which did not emanate from themselves.   1,&apos;IR.FISHER was of opinion that it would be necessary toobtain a decision in the near future on the question whetherthe League of nations was to be used for coercion or not-The Americans objected both to Article X and to the Blockadeprovisions, and the British Representative must, in his vieweither vote for the maintenance of both these provisionsor for the rejection of both.   He doubted whether thepolitical atmosphere would have cleared sufficiently by nextHay to enable definite instructions to be given to the BritishRepresentativej and he should therefore favour the policyof accepting as few amendments to the Covenant as possible,
                               1                             &quot;...   352            It was -then, suggested that the\Bri.tiel., -Oov^nurot  -ight       -nominate some  distinguished &quot;lawyer as their representative a;        the  Committee  t?  deal  with the existing amendments,  on the        understanding  that  if  Important  questions  of principle arse        on these or on any  other  amendments  a Minister of Cabinet  rank        should  be  substituted  for him.    fen  the other hand,  it  was        pointed out  that  swe  of  the present amendments  involve!        political  issues1  of the first  importance,  which  made it desir-        able  that  a  Cabinet Minister should  represent  Great  Britain        from  the start.   Moreover,  if FranOe was to be represented by       M. Viviani,  Great Britain  should have  a representative  of        similar prestige  and distinction.  If  necessary, the Minister        could delegate his  functions to soiJb other person when ques-       tions oth-r  than  these raising important political issues were       under consideratian,           It was generally recognised that while the Secretary of       State for Foreign Affairs would be the Cabinet Minister best       cjuali^i^d to represent Great Britain on this Committee, the       pressure on his time, and  other similar considerations, rendar-       ed his nomination impracticable.           The Conference  agreed  to recommend             (i) That Mr Balfsur should be instructed  to                inform thr Council of the League that r&amp;s                Majesty&apos;s Government had nominate:&apos;, him. to                act as their representative on the Q/aomlbtee                to  consider amendments to the Covenant oi:                occasions  -hen important amendments wore under                consideration!           (ii) That it should be  open to i/ir Ba-If-ur  to                delegate his authority to some ether  iarson                on  occasions when  the Ccrrvittee were  con-                sidering amendments other than those  indi-                cated in (i) above.H:;%         (g) in the course o^ the foregoing  discussion  it wasNATIONWilTTEE pointed out  that  the Norwegian Government, which had itselfteOTTS*E&apos;-OVB- proposed amendments  to the  CovenantB was being given repre-        sentation.on the  Committee, and that  this  might  lead to a        claim by the Dominions to  representation,,  rartieularly in        the case of  Canada,  whioh  had suggested an imjortant amendment.        namely,  the  deletion of Article X.
ll-    353      It was generally rec^gjvltf-ed^                       could  not claim two representatives on this Oormittee, but  Mr BAL.F)UR agreed to discuss with the- Secretary-G^n^ral sf  the League the question raised as to the desirability of  Norwegian..representation, in the circumstances.N     (3) The Conference-were--informed that this  Committee ;^wcun consist of six members, to be  appointed by Prance.  GreatN  -                                                     &apos;  Britain,  Switzerland,  Holland,  Brazil and Italy respectively,      Mr BALFOUR indicated that the Article in question was  intended  to apply to  large and  important Treaties between  nations involving political issues  of great  magnitude, and  was certainly not   meant  to apply to every hind  of internation-  al  engagement,  such, for example, as  arrangements entered  into between two  Treasuries in  c-onne-ctitm with  financial  operations.   If it was  found  impossible  to establish  the  above  interpretation of  the Article,  it  would be necessary to  consider  its  alteration  in the  above  sense.      It  was  agreed             To  recommend that,  subject to the concurrence           of the  Secretary  of  State  for&quot;Foreign  Affairs,           Sir Cecil Hurst should be nominated as the           British  Petr^santative on  the Committee cn           Article  XVXII of  the Oovenaafc.      (4)  The Conference  were  informed that the  duty ofthis  Committee would b* to compare and co-ordinate the legislative  measures  to  be taken in  the  different countries for declaring  an  economic  blockade if  and when necessary,   Tho Oormittoe  would be  composed of six members, representative if Great  Britain,  France,  Holland,  Norway, Switzerland and Cuba,      ADMIR/L  BROCK informed&apos; the  Conference  that  the Admiralty  held very strong  views on  this  subject.   So  long as the Q&apos;?m-  mittee  confined itself to  a discussion of  questions connecter  with an economic  blockade,  the  Admiralty were not much con-  earned:  but i* th*re was  any question of the consideration  of  an  effective blockade,  or  the use  of  British Naval Forces.
trie matter would become one of great moment.   The Admiraltypreferred to be dissociated from the Committee as in theiropinion the questions which should be discussed related solely to the use of the economic weapon.   It must be clearly understood that the British Representative must enter into nokind of arrangement which would in any way commit the Admiralty.      Some discussion took place as to the person who should  ;he nominated to represent Great Britain on the Committee.It was generally felt to be Important to secure the servicesof some Minister who was Intimately acquainted with themeasures taken during the late War by Great Britain to enforce the-economic blockade on Germany, and it was suggested that sir Laming Worthington Evans, who had been largely instrumentalin concerting  these measures, would be the most appropriateperson to represent Great Britain on the Committee.      The Conference agreed   (1) To recommend that Sir Laming Worthington Evans       should; if possible,,be the British Representative       on the Committee on Blockade;   (il)That the instructions to the British Representative       should  clearly indicate that he must enter into       no kind of arrangement which would in any way commit       the Admiralty without first obtaining the  assent of       that Department.    (5)  Mr. BALFOUR informed the Committee that  the organisa-tionand expenditure of the Secretariat of the League ofNations and the Labour Office came in for a good deal of criticism at the Assembly, and explained that these twobodies were more or less independent of one another which also led to difficulties.   Moreover, under the present arrangements the basis of contribution of the various Statesworked out&apos; inequitably: Australia,  for instance, being calledupon to- contribute towards the expenses as much  as GreatBritain.   He. suggested that it would be necessary to have arepresentative on the Committee appointed by the&quot;Treasury,;which representative should be a person intimately acquainted with establishment work and organisation.&apos;,   -
           Sir H. Lambert pointed out that there  was a  specially strong     case for giving the Dominions representation ^n this Committee,     inasmuch as Australia, wew Zealand, and South Africa as well as     India had all shown a keen Interest in this question at Geneva,     but it was felt Improbable that  the Council would agree to two     representatives of the British Empire, and in view  of the short     time available, it might be difficult to get  the Dominions to agree     on some particular representative.           Ultimately the Conference agreed to re commend;        (i) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer should  be           invited to nominate some  suitably qualified  person           to act as the British Representative on this Committee:       (ii) ^hat Mr. Balfour should do his best to persuade the          &apos; Council of the League to  agree to the  appointment of           a representative of the Dominions; which, the Council           might be reminded, had been most active in urging           reduced expenditure on administration  and a  change           of system. ITTEE    (6)  The Conference were Informed that the Assembly hadlEDUC- OP   passed a resolution  Inviting the Council^ inter alia, to 1ENTS.      instruct a temporary Commission, composed of persons possessing     the  requisite competence  in matters of a political, social and     economic nature, to prepare for  the Council in the  near future     reports and proposals for the reduction of armaments, as provided     for in Article VIII of  the Covenant.   It  was suggested that this     temporary Commission  should consist of 21 members,  six of  whom     would  be representatives  of the  Permanent Military  Commission,     six would be selected by  the Governing body of the  Labour     Office (three representing employers and  three representing  Labour),                                            Financial     two would be selected by  the Provisional        *  Committee,     two from the  Provisional  Economic  Committee.     and the  remaining  five  would be  gentlemen of  political fame  and     would  be  selected  by  the  Council.            lhe  French  GoverTAient would.probably appoint M.  Viviani,     who would be the  Chairman, and  the other  members  of the Committee     would  be M.  Branting  (Sweden).  M0  Blanca  (Uruguay), and either     an Italian  or  a  Japanese  and a  British representative..
of the Commission would be the difficult  task  ofcomparing War Budgets.    In his view the   LR.  BALFOUR suggested that Lire. Fisher would be an appro-priate representative for Great Britain, but ilR, FISHERthought that some person conversant with high,  finance wouldbe a nore suitable choice, and in this connection pointedout that one of the duties of the Commission would be the difficult teak of compering .ar Budgets.  In his view, theBritish Representative should be some ex Chancellor of theExchequer, curl.he suggested the name of iir. hcKenna.   After some further discussion, the Conference agreed --            that llr. Balfour should consider            the names of  s uitable persons with            a view to the selection by the Cabinet            of the British.Representative on the            Committee on the Reduction of Armaments0   (7) In connection with the Resolution on the Traffic inOpium, the Conference were informed that the Eastern Coloniesderived a substantial part of their revenue from opium (Inthe case of the Strafts-i^ettle-inents, over half), and thatany sudden prohibition of opium in those Colonies wouldnot only  have very serious financial consequences, but might easily lead to disturbancesa   It was most desirablethat there should be some special representative of thoseColonies on the proposed Advisory CommitteeQ   It was pointed out that the Resolution in questionmerely related to the formal handing over to the Ler-me of rations of the work of carrying out t, e Hague  Conventionalto which Greet Britain was a signatory.   The Conference agreed to recommend -         (i)  That the Home Secretary should be invited              to nominate the british^i Representative on             - the Advisory Committee          (ii)  That the Colonial Offices should  be requested              to prepare a memorandums for circulation to              the Cabinet, on the question of  the prohibit              tion of opium in the.Eastern Colonies: the              Memorandum in question to &quot;pe drafted on the              basis that Great Britain had signed the              Hague&apos; Convention and that it wras not prac-              ticable to o;e.t such. Convention altered.
Commission on ?portation of ?omen and ?ildren in Turkey and neigh- ? uring Countries

8. The Conference were informed that it would not be possible to effect Very much  in regard to this question until the Treaty of Sevres had been ratified, but that it was proposed to constitute a Commission of three persons who might start collecting information on the subject with the help of the  High Commissioners at Constantinople. The Commission would consist of representatives of Great Britain Italy and France, the French Government would probably nominate Madame Gaulie, who was alleged to be closely associated with the Nationalist Turkish Party. The Conference agreed to recommend :-

that the Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs should be requested to invite the British High Commissioner  at Constantinople to recommend a suitable person to serve as the British Representative on this Commission.

Traffic in Women and Children.

9. In connection with the Resolution passed on this subject by the Assembly of the league on the 15th, December, 1920, it was pointed out that the Assembly, had only requested the Council to invite the countries signatory or adherent to the International Conventions of 1904 and 1910 to send representatives to an International Conference to be held before the next Assembly, and it was suggested that the Council might think it desirable to extend this invitation to countries not signatory or adherent to the International Conventions  in question. 

The Conference agreed to recommend,- 

(i) that the Home Secretary should be invited ? nominate a suitable person to ? British Representative at the International. Conference in question.

(ii) that the Council should be moved to extend the invitation to the International Conference to countries not signatory or  adherent to the International Conventions of 1904 and 1910.

The/


10*  This Commission is to consist of nine members,the majority of wbiom are to be nationals of non-mandatoryPowers.   It.has been-suggested that the Committeeshould be composed of representatives of Great Britain,Prance, Japan, Portugal, Holland, Italy, Belgium and czechoslovakia,; with, possibly a representative of theUnited States of America..  Each Mandatory Power is tobe authorised to appoint a representative to participate in the discussion of  the Reoort which he will present to the Commission in the name of his Government.   After some discussion the Conference agreed torecommend: r*           that the Secretary of State for the Colonies           should be invited to suggest to the Cabinet           the name of a suitable person to act as           British Representative on the Mandates           Cornells si on *    In the course of the discussion, reference v/asmade to the fact that the French had inserted in theirnBn Liandates a provision enabling them tc use troopsraised within the mandated territory, outside those territories,, and that it was most desirable that asimilar provision should be inserted in the correspondingBritish Mandates.     iir. Balfour explained that the French had alwaysInsisted on their right, in the case of a general war,to use black troops in Europe, but that Great britain had never put forward such a claim.   After considerable discussion at Geneva, he had received the &quot;B&quot; Mandates,and had submitted them to the Council, and only after his return from Geneva had he heard   of the T.&apos;ar Office/objections
objections.   In his view there was nothing in the&quot;B&quot; Mandates to preclude the military authorities fromcarrying out in any particular case defensive militaryoperations., involving the use of troops raised in the mandated territory outside the borders of that territory.   Major General Thwaites explained that although the WarOffice had been invited to an Interdepartmental  Committeento discuss the military provisions of the &quot;A&apos;1 Mandatesno opportunity had been giVen to the General Staff toexpress their views as regards similar provisions for &quot;B&quot;Mandates; and that it ms only when the MB*&apos; Mandates werevirtually decided upon that the General Staff were able  topresent their protest as regards the Article dealing withthe employment of troops*   Sir H. -Lambert said that the Colonial Office  WAS aiiiteready, if desired, to furnish reports on its Mandated territory-ies in Africa in accordance with-the  suggestion  made in  theResolution of the Assembly on the  subject.2, umitehall Gardens, S..W.,9th February, 1921.
