(P 82:&apos;)/&apos;Vo/;t Viceroy, (Amiijii and Political Department, 1707\0lh February 1021.v &quot; .....14 (Received 2 p.m.)Clear the line. *ISO S. Our telegram ol&apos; the (V 5th February, No. 170 S., Afghanistan), ft seemsclear that, unless we can help Afghan Government to climb down from the impossibleattitude they have publicly adopted towards frontier tribes, whole negotiations willalmost certainly collapse. Formula under which Afghan Government will feel thattheir face is adequately saved and which, at the same time, will not prejudice ourown interests, is not easy to devise, but we think the one drafted by Dobbs holds outgood promise, of success. In reality, it would give away nothing. Recognition ofAfghanistan^ interest in the welfare of Pathan tribes is after all recognition ofexisting facts, from which we cannot get away, and which we utilised during the Avar,in regard to Waziristan, with ltabibulla, with great advantage to ourselves. Norwould undertaking of apprising Afghan Government of measures about to be takenfor maintenance of order amongst our tribes (as we recently did over Wano expedition)be embarrassing in practice, especially as element of surprise does not ordinarilyfigure in our operations, and if. it were ever called for, intimation to AfghanGovernment &quot;could be arranged to coincide with commencement of operations,.Proposed undertaking, moreover, is bilateral and would bear (on paper) more hardlyon Afghan Government, which, administer right up to their border, than on,us, who donot. As, however, the phrase &quot; joint benevolent intentions toward tribes&quot; mightconceivably encourage the idea that we admitted Afghanistan to a share in control ofour tribes, the word &quot; joint &quot; should be avoided.Dobbs&apos; lasf sentence no doubt would figure very awkwardly in a treaty, andwould be dealt with better by supplementary exchange of notes. Should Afghans,however, insist on insertion in actual treaty, it would be small price to pay forconfirming settlement. Hence, as breakdown of negotiations would/be fraught withgrave consequences, we urge strongly that Dobbs be authorised to negotiate-on thebasis of his draft; and solicit your approval by clear the line telegram.
