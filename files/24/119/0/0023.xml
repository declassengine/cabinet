1. RESOLUTION OF THE ASSEMBLY.

The Assembly of the League of Nations at its Meeting on Tuesday, November 23, 1920, adopted the following Resolution:-

"That the Council should be called upon to entrust the examination of the scope of Article 18 of the Covenant from a legal point of view to a special Committee, which would prepare for the Council all relevant proposals to secure a uniform application of the Article in respect of the validity of Treaties. The Council would then report on the question to the next General Assembly, and place before it the proposals of the special Committee."

The Council is called upon to decided whether or not it will adopt the Resolution of the Assembly.



2. STATEMENT OF THE QUESTION.

The members of the Council will remember that at their Meeting in Rome on May 19, 1920, they approved a memorandum dealing with the registration and publication of Treaties in accordance with the terms of Article 18 of the Covenant. (Process Verbal of the Fifth Session of the Council held in Rome on May 14th and 19th, 1920, pages 11, 12, 13, 14 and 42).

As the application of this memorandum and of Article/ 
^  Artiole 18 might givo rise to various interpretations,  the Oounoil   recognised that the measures it proposed should he t/ubjoct to any   alteration or revision that praotlcal experience night  render   advisable-  (Paragraph 1 of .the memorandum).             At the Seventh Meeting of the Assembly (see Assembly -  Journal No.6 of November 20, page 30),  Jonkhoer Van Karnebeok,   tho Delegate of the Netherlands stated his opinion concerning   the scopa of Article &apos;10 of the Covenant from a legal point of   viow,  and also oonoeming the various interpretations to which   this Artiole night  give rise.             The following questions ho said, arose       (1)    Would States in future be bound by  any Treaty             previous  to its registration?       (2)    Would States be able during tho period between             the ratification and registration of a Treaty             to freo themselves from their obligations,  as             they are  able to do during the period between             tho signature and ratification of a Treaty?       (3)    Admitting that States are bound&apos;,  should the             Signatories be entitled to insist reciprocally             on the execution of a Treaty before registration             has taken plaoe?       (4)    tfntil a Treaty has been registered, would the             Signatories be able to avail themselves of  its          -   provisions vis-a^vis the. league of  Nations?   Mo  TITTONI:   At the mooting Of November 20 (see Assembly  Journal   No.7,  November 21,  page 44)  states that in his opinion  a Treaty   was binding upon the parties which signed it, but that  it  would   not be valid vis-a-vis the League of Nations, and the latter  could   n;t be oalled upon  to enforce its oxeoution if it had&quot;not  been !  registered,.   M.v  1.0TTA;     was of opinion  that the provisions of Article  18,  -the object of which is to  inaugurate the era  of open  diplomacy  &apos;ought  to  be strictly a&apos;plied.   (See Assembly  Journal  No.6,   November  20,  page 31).   M.  KARNBSBEDK and li,, TIT TON I  thought that a Committee  of Jurists   who could  devote themselves  to the  study of this question,  in   detail. Would be able  to furnish the. next General Assembly with   useful proposals.                                  - 2  -
           The Oouneil oan therefore if it DO desires, prooood to  the appointment of this Committee,  in ordor to carry the Reselution into effect.    In view of the extremely important and technical charaoter cf the questions involved, it would seem desirable that the Committee should consist of eninont jurists,  cf whioh the Council may wish to nominate the chairman.         ,  The Legal Soction of the secretariat will act as a Secretariat of the Committee. 3.   EXPENSES OF  THE COidlCCTIElL           The League will beatf the expenses of the Cemmitteo.           Since these expenses were not included in the Third Budget,  as adopted by the Assembly, it seems essential that they should be charged to Artiole 27 of Chapter II of the Budget (Unforeseen expenses,  setting cial Committees of J3ncuiry, etc - 50,000 gold francs).  The inclusion of those oxpenses should be  made the subject of a special resolution of the Council and should be  communicated by the Seoretsry^Genoral to all the Members of the League.&apos;           The Assembly laid down, in a oortain number of Articles, tho principles by which  it wished the  Council to be guided in the administration of the finances of  the  League.    Artiole  6 runs as followc:-           &quot;Unforeseen expenditure can  only be incurred           ,runder  &quot;tho last item of Chapter  II (Item 27)           wif It    jmthorizie^y^ajspecjal Resolution           uoi ; &amp;TTjo^^                    immediately           &quot;&quot;communicated  to  all the Members of the  League           &quot;of Nations.&quot;           It  is proposed to gi ve  to the Members of tho Commitiee an  allowanoe  of  4 per day, apart from their travelling oxpenses,etc           The  following  draft resolution ,1s--subiait-fcedI-           &quot;The Council of the  League of Nations,  in accordance with the resolution of tho  Assembly, dated November 23rd,  1920, decides to  appoint  a-O-oriimittoe-ol,Jurists  to study the  scope of Article  18 of  the  Covenant from the  legal point of view,  and                                                            to/
to submit proposals to enable the Council to  report to thonext assembly.&quot;             Tho Counoil decides that 1. -.........r                                  Chairman.be asked to serve on the Committee.          The expenses incurred by this Committee shall becharged te Article 27 of Chapter II of the Third Budget ofthe league (Unforeseen Expenditure:  Special Committees ofEnquiry, etc,) and the Cbuncil shall allocate the neoessarysum accordingly.   The Members of the Committee shall receive an allowance of  4 per day:  together with thoir travellingexpensesa          The Secretary-General is instruoted immediately to notify all Members of the League of this Resolution.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I..
