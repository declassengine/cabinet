Of 1UTI0E3, GiMEXU                                 24th January, 19 1,Sir,     I h:.vo tho honour to transmit to you copy of aMemorandum from tho Secretary of Stato in Washington,which was sent on the 22nd January to Monsieur Hymens,President of tho Council of the League of Nations,by the United States Minister in Brussels.     As you will sec, repeated references are made totho Principal Allied Powers in this Memorandum, which deals with the question of Armenia in its widest aspen     I have, therefore, thought it right to send youimmediately a copy of the Memorandum, in order that t&quot;nRepresentatives of Franco, Great Britain, Italy and japan, may havo cognisance of it during their presentMeetings P     The Memorandum is being circulated at once to theMembers of the Council, who will doubtless consider itat their next Meeting on the Agenda, for which thequestion of Armenia has already been placed.             I havo the honour to be,                     Sir;,                Your obedient Servant,                   (Sd)  ERIC DRUhhOND,                      Secretary General,Tho Right honble.      David Lloyd George,,  0.M,
      &quot;Your to.legrr.ra of December 26th, 1920, transmitting a message received by the Council from the British Governmentconcerning Armenia, stating that Armenia is reported to be under the control of Soviet Russiaj  and suggesting thattho President request the American High Commissioner atConstantinople to take up the matter with the Allied high commissioners, has been received  and read with&apos;interest by-the President, who instructs me to reply as followsi  ThoPresident does not deem it practicable to instruct theAmerican High Commissioner at Constantinople to act for him in this matter.   As was stated in my telegram ofDecember 16th, 1920, he has chosen the Honourable HenryMorgcnthau, who has been prepared to act for him &quot;in seensteps as may be taken.   Before instructing him to proceed,however, the President has been avalting definite assurancesand information jfroin all the Principal Powers interested as requested in his cable of November 30th, 1920, defining theconditions under which he would endeavour to mediate.     Tho message from the British Prime Minister transmitted by you on December 26th, would seem to indicate the imprao-practicability or futility of the President s addressing himself,at least in the first instance, to the Armenians and emailsts.   The President is inclined, to share this view,and to feel that no solution can be judged without firstgetting at the source of tho trouble.     Pending receipt of information and assurances requested by the President in telegram of November 30th, 1920, it is deemed wise to state the problem as the President views it,its causes, and proceed to remedies.   It would appear thatthe immediate cause of trouble in Armenia and Turkey has beenthe Treaty of Sevres.   Admittedly this was a difficult question with which, to contend, but the Treaty was drafted bythe Allied Powers,  and the trouble has arisen over tho failureof certain factions to accept this Treaty and of the allies to enforce it.        ...                 This/    i
1&apos;hls is a  question over which tho President has no control, rnd any measures which he might take or recommend in this direction would be dependent upon the hearty co-operation end support of  the Allied Powers.,.         The British Pr ln$  Minister calls at tent ion to the report that Armenia is under the control eP \ IOSCOW, fao m which it appears th--t another come licet ion hag developed.   The dependence of Armenia  on Soviet Russia is another situation over which the  President has no control, and he sees no steps he could take to force Armenia  without the moral and diplomatic suoeort oT the  principal powers, which holds promise of brin/t- ina peace end accord to the contending parties.         There is bitter distrust and fear of war a long all  the  . Russian borders.   It  seems futile  to attempt  to bring peace to the Caucasus if the result is., merely to free the forces  , there engaged for new  campaigns on  other sectors of this Ion/? front, &quot;&apos;                                        &apos; &apos;&apos;   -a,- &apos;.         The distressful situation of Armenia is but one datail of this vest Russian problem, end  th:;;  Pr&quot;isid-ntmost earnestly uraes his &quot;conviction that it is only by a p-eneral and comerehen- sive treatment  of the  whole problem, only by full and complete, generous  co-operation  of the principal powers, that a. hopeful approach to the pacification and independencof Armenia can be found.         The attitude, of the President towards  those now in  power in Russia has been frequently -ad clearly expressed.   He regards the Bolsheviks  as u violent and tyrannical minority, by no moans representing the real  desires and&apos; purposes of  the, Russian people, But he has never believed&apos; that  the  problems raised by this  coup d&apos;etat could be solved by military  action from outside.  He new hopes that the  recent  tragical  events on the Polish front and in. the Crimea, have convinced all the: world that armed invasion is not th  &quot;Ty to  bring peace to the people of Russia.
         The  constant shiftina  of  events  of  recent months hove only,  in his conviction,  proved  that  the Russian  Revolution, beneficient  in  its  main  purposes,  must be developed  to 0 satisfactory conclusion  by the Russians  themselvesn   Help may,  from time  to time,  be given  from outside when voluntarily received; but  attempts  at military co.ire ion can but end in disaster.         Ther-. are elements in  the  present situation  which give added  hope to projects of  pacification.   All the world is weary  of mvt and the conviction  grows among the peoples of all countries that  the military method offers very little oromise  of solving  the grave problems of reconstruction which face us.   There is  at present no  overt  civil war in Russia., It is  now a  problem  of the relations between central Russia and the  surrounding  smaller national  groups.   The unrest and instability  along the border are  caused  by bitter and mutual distrust.    The struggling  now nationalities which were formerly a p^rt of the Russian Empire are afraid to disarm and return to the works of pence., because they distrust the Bolsheviks and fear  new aggressions.   The Soviets contend that they are afraid  to demobilize because they fear now attacks 0         The  great impediment to peaceful reconstruction in these  troubled border territories, the imminent danger of new hostilities, is caused by  the utter confusion between offense and defense.  Unless this distinction can be clearly defined, there  is not only small hop: of peace,, but no hope of a clear perception of aho is responsible for new wars.         It is, therefore, the  thought of the ^resident that the present moment offers a peculiarly pressing challenge to an attempt nt general pacification on the Russian border-,Along these  lines an attempt seems to the President  the logical outgrowth:   in fact, the  only logical development
of tho request to mediate in the Armenian conflict;  and he feels hound in conscience once more to call this matter to the attention of the Associated Nations.     It is obvious to all that these small end struggling-border States will not attach great Russia unless encouraged&quot;&apos;by promises of support from the stronger powers *   ThePreident, therefore, believes that the sine-qua non of anattempt at pacification must be a public and solemnengagement among tho Great Powers not to take advantage.of Russia!s stricken condition, and not to violate thoterritorial integrity of Russia, nor undertake themselvessuch an invasion, of Russia, nor to- tolerate such invasionsby others.     Such a public agreement .should, in effect, say tothose now in power in Russia:   &quot;You are not menaced from outside.   The Great Powers have voluntarily guaranteed&quot;you from attack.   You can have peace if you want it.&quot;Tho responsibility for any now war which might break outon the Russian border would then be definitely placed.     If the principal Powers represented on the Council oftho League find themselves in accord with the Presidentin this matter, and will assure him of their moral and diplomatic support, ho will instruct his personal reprosenta-tive, Mr. Horgcnth.au, to proceed at once on his mission,&quot;  -
