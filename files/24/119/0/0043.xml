CABINET.r::^------- v   ^Removal  of Controlled  Prices for  Imported MeatCP  2542      on 51st March 1921.Memorandum by the Food Controller.     The maintenance of control after&quot; the 31st March 1521 would ensure a supply cf cheap meat at a time when the prices of English sleat  are likely to be high,     To-day uncontrolled English Beef is  l/5^d per lb; ?ocntrollPd  imror- t^d Beef lOd per lb.  ^ncontrollod English  Mutton is l/ojd per lb; controlled Imported Mutton 9d per lb.     ThQ arrivals of Australasian meat are  likely to be unusually  light in April and May. and the remcval of controlled prices at the end  of&quot; March would probably be followed by an Increase of at least 3d per lb on all imported iupplies.     WA rise of 3d a lb in Imprrtod meat  would mean an increase of over  300,000 per week to be paid by oonsumers in thin country.   It would be reflected by an increase of over 2^ points  in the Ministry of Labour&apos;s index number of the cost of living.  This would mean an increase  of  12,000 per week in the wages bill of Industries direotly governed by the index number, and If a similar adjustment of wages had to be  made  In other industries, it would mean an inorease,  (or at least the prevention of a decrease), of approximately  250,000 per &quot;reek in the wages bill of the country.     On the other hand the difficulty of  maintaining controlled prices for imported meat is very considerable.   Up to the present practically the whole of cur imports of meat with the oxception of Argentine  Beef&apos;havejIconsisted of Government purchases from the  Colonies.  Colonial meat hasialready begun  to arrive on private aocount.  The Colonial GovernmentsIhave already protested against the suggestion that control of priceJshould be maintained on privately imported  Colonial meat.   If Colonial line at is entirely freed from control,  it would be very difficult,  or as 11 am advised,  impossible to maintain  control  on  other imported meat.   It is becoming  increasingly difficult to maintain any price controls in the face of organised trade pressure which makes  itself felt in  the  Press and in Parliament.     Administratively owing to the progressive disbandment  of  the liniotry&apos;s staff, it  is becoming more and more difficult to  ensure equitable distribution of meat supplies under any  system of  control.  he oentrol  of prioes demands  that every  retailer  shall  be  able  to obtain supplies  at a  flat price, and  to achieve  this  it  is  necessary  that the oost  of  transport to the  retailer be  borne by  the vendor,   When the  enior  is the  Government no difficulty  arises, but when the  vendor is  a ivate trader there is naturally the inducement to dispose of the meatlo the nearest buyor.  This has already resulted in complaintspart of Glasgow and tho more distant industrial centres, whiohsuffered seriously from a shortage of Argentine beef.on the whole    If control had to be made really effective the machinery of Meatdistribution Committees would&apos;have to be restored, the Enforcement staffncroaoed, and the polioy of disbandment partially reversed.    Taking all circumstances into consideration, it seems to me that allontrol of imported meat ohould be removed on the 31st March, but in view  the probable effect on prices and wages, I think the Cabinet ehouldAve an opportunity of considering and determining the matter.CHARLES A McCURDY.Inistry of Pood,  5th February 1921,
