//556/(P 822)From Secretary of State to Viceroy] Foreiqn Department,&apos; llth February 1921.Clear the line.923. Your telegram of 1.0th February, 186.S, Afghanistan. I agree with youthat, having gone so far, we ought not to allow negotiations to break down if this canbe prevented by minor concessions calculated to save Afghan face in matter of tribes.Dobb&apos;s draft, even amended by Your Excellency, presents some points of &quot;difficulty.His -proposals relate to two only of long series of Articles in Afghan draft. Thereremain other highly contentious clauses still to be considered, and I should like tofeel more assured that we are really smoothing the way towards a general settlement,before committing ourselves to offers that will certainly be quoted against usafterwards in event of failure to reach agreement.Point of primary importance seems to me to be proposed formal recognition ofright of Afghans to interest themselves in our Pathans on ground of commonnationality. This surely is a step of special significance. In effect, it departs vitallyfrom the attitude which we have-hitherto consistently maintained on tribal question,and which it seems to me very desirable to uphold in difficult times before us.Proposed exchange of visits is not open to this objection, on the understandingthat object is merely to promote neighbourly relations between two coterminousStates without admitting that either party has any special interest in the subjectsof the other. For this reason I feel strongly that passage in Dobb&apos;s draft beginning&quot; of Afghan origin &quot; and ending &quot; closely interested &quot; should be omitted, or at leastsome alternative formula substituted that would not emphasise Afghan origin of tribesas justification for Afghan interest in their affairs or admit formally that Afghanistanis interested in tribes on our side of Durand line. I do not wish to press my objectionto point of breaking down negotiations. But I am anxious that you and Dobbsshould be fully apprised of my views, and of my strong hope that means may befound of giving effect to them. With these explanations I leave matters to YourExcellency&apos;s discretion. ^I agree with you as to omission of word &quot;joint&quot; and as to last sentence ofDobb&apos;s draft.With regard to proposed exchange of visits, there is one practical point that Iwish to mention at once. It seems to me important on administrative grounds thatvisits should be limited to formal occasions at stated intervals and to duly authorisedofficers. A system of informal meetings between subordinate officials is likely toresult in embarrassing commitments being contracted without considered judgmentof Chief Commissioner or Your Excellency&apos;s Government. In theory, no doubt, itwould be the same for both sides, but in practice Amir would probably considerhimself free to disown his representatives with a lack of compunction wholly alien totraditions of British Government. This is a point to be borne in mind when timecomes for settlement of details contemplated in Dobbs&apos;s draft. Annual frontiermeetings on Burma-China frontier may afford convenient precedent.I appreciate the difficulty of undertaking negotiations of this kind, and I do notwant to lay undue stress on the embarrassments likely to result if important proposalswhich you or His Majesty&apos;s government have not approved and may wish to amend,are communicated informally or privately to Afghans. In present case procedureadopted has necessarily prejudiced to some extent both your judgment and my own.I am sure that Dobbs fully appreciates this consideration.
