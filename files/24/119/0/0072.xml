SECRET.Middle-Eastern Affairs.EMOUANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE l(&apos;OU  \V,\i;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;naviiig given  careful con side ration  to  these subjects, I would ask theCabinet to approve the following decisions in  principle: &apos;     (1) The report of  the  Inter-Departmental Committee on the scope audorganisation of the Middle  Eastern Department, subject to a clear affirmationthat the initiative  and  effective control of  all  policy within  the  middle eastern area as defined by  the Committee shall be vested in the Secretary oi.&apos;State for the Colonies.   Action can then be  taken to set up ;i  department and to develop a policy.     (2) That  a  conference should bo  held  in  Egypt in  the early part ofMarch, at which the  Secretary  of  State lor  the  Colonies should meet our principal military and  civil representatives in Mesopotamia, and such otherofficials of the Middle Eastern Department  as he may think lit.   (See my telegram No. 61.)     (3) The  decision  as to the  moment when I lie present Coniiuander-iu-Chief in Mesopotamia shall be replaced by an officer  whose junior rank willbe more appropriate to the reduced permanent garrison  shall rest with theSecretary of  State  for the Colonies.   (It is  proposed to take  this decisionafter the conference referred to in para. 2.)     (4) The Cabinet  should  indicate for my guidance what they considerwould  be a suitable grant-in-aid for Mesopotamia after the present evacuation of  the main  body of the  troops has been effected and the reduced force isholding the country.  This  grant-in-aid should  be prescribed on a  threeyears&apos;  basis  beginning with the  financial year 1922-23.   Unless 1 know thelength my colleagues are prepared to go, it is impossible for me to ascertain whether a suitable force can  be formed  to  hold the  country  and how muchof the country can  be held. Unless  the Cabinet  can  see their way toauthorise plans to be made on the basis of about 7,000,000?. a year for  threeyears after the present year,  I doubt very much whether  it will  be possibleto  discharge the conditions  of  the  mandate.   At a later stage I shall  beprepared  to indicate  a  much  smaller figure for Palestine,  but 1 am not sufficiently informed on the subject at the present time.   The aggregate ofthese two figures will constitute the Middle Eastern grant-in-aid, and theywill comprise all other  expense,  by subsidies or otherwise, that may be incurred in the areas in question.w. s.  c.10th February 1921.WAR OFFICE3321-1100 2.21
SECRET.MESOPOTAMIA.PRIVATE TELEGRAMS.1            From Secretary of State to High Commissioner, Mesopotamia,                                 8th January 11)21.    Clear the line.    Personal and  Secret.  Following from  Secretary  of State for War to you andGeneral Officer Commanding-in-Chief, to whom please communicate copy at once.    No. 1.  I have been entrusted with the general direction of the Cabinet policy inMesopotamia.   At  the moment of taking up this task I wish to  define it precisely for your guidance and in order that you may be able to assist me to the full.    It is  impossible  for us to  throw upon the British taxpayer the  burdens formilitary expenditure in Mesopotamia  which are entailed by your present schemes for holding the country.   Unless some  better method  can be devised and brought intooperation within the financial year 1921-22, retirement and contraction to the coastalzone is inevitable and  must be accomplished as rapidly as possible.  Seeing, however,that General Ironside&apos;s fighting troops cannot begin  their retirement  from North-West Persia till 1st April, and  that Mosul must  be  held until  at least his  rearguardhas reached. Kanikin, it is certain that very considerable military forces  must remainin Mesopotamia during the greater pare of the financial year 1921-22.  The presenceof these forces  for  many months to come, and the effects produced upon the Arabs bythe suppression of  the rebellion and by the surrender of rifles, give  me the hope that by the effective use of the resources at our  disposal we may be able  to set up an ArabGovernment, through  whose agency the peaceful development  of the country may be assured without undue demands upon Great Britain.  It is to this policy that we mustdevote our efforts.    I wifl address  you at an early date upon  the selection of an  Arab ruler.    It is scarcely appropriate to consider the permanent garrison of Mesopotamia interms of brigades and divisions.    I contemplate  the formation  of  an Imperial Mesopotamian  Police Force (British)of exceptional individual quality, and the formation of  Indian military units speciallyrecruited from India or by volunteers from the forces now serving in Mesopotamia,together  with an  application  of the system of air control Avhich has already beenelaborated.    I trust that by these  methods, in regard  to which  action will be  immediatelybegun, it may be found possible for us  to do justice  to  the mandate which we have accepted.    Let me assure you of my  earnest. wish  to  collaborate with you in this task andthus to avoid the melancholy consequences attendant upon its failure.                           Answered by Nos. 4 and 5.2           From Secretary of Stale to High Commissioner, Mesopotamia,                               8th January 1921.    Clear the line.    From Secretary of State for War.  No. 2.  My immediately preceding telegram.Your position will  remain as defined  in War  Office  telegram to General OfficerCommanding, Baghdad, 86089, dated 27th August.. 3        From Secretary of State to High Commissioner, 10th January 1921.                          (Duplicate to General Haldane.)     Personal and Secret.     87&apos;163.   In pursuance of my No&apos;. 1.   On your proposed rate of military reduction, I have had to take on Army Estimates for financial year 1921-22 over 25 millions, in-addition to about one million on Air Estimates.   Any saving which can be effected on this total without a disaster will greatly improve our position and chances of eventual success.  You  should therefore expedite the departure  of  every unit that can  be      3321    100  2.21                  A
spared and hold on only to the essential points.   Do not keep artillery beyond whatis needed for the kind of operation you  have recently had to conduct.  On the otherhand,  I am  sending you two more air squadrons, the first starting within a month,making six in all.   You should begin to apply the principles of the air scheme, at anyrate in some parts    (2) Committees have been set up at the War Office to frame a scheme for raisingan Imperial  Mesopotamian Police of high  individual  quality, in the first  instance upto  2,000 men.  Secondly, to frame  a scheme for recruiting  from  India specialregiments and battalions for permanent  service in Mesopotamia up  to 8,000 men.Thirdly, as an alternative, to  consider the possibility and  to frame a scheme for usingWest African troops.    (3) Until we  know whether we  are  going to be  able to devise a scheme  for holding Mesopotamia, I cannot sanction railway  scheme or permanent works apart,of course, from repairs to torn up lines.    (4) Prime Minister is anxious that I should visit Mesopotamia in March, and takenecessary decisions on the spot.   A light cruiser would bring me from Suez to Basrain seven days.   Responsibility for deciding will  rest with me, but I should like toknow your  view, together with itinerary of one month&apos;s duration  in the country, andany advice about climate, &amp;c.    (5) Let me have your answers jointly or severally to  this telegram not later thanthe 21st January.  Telegraph also fully  on  every  point  where  you  require myassistance.  .                            Answered by Nos. 7  and 8.4            From High Commissioner, Baghdad, 13th January 1921.                                (Received 3 pan.)     186 S.  Personal  and Secret.   In reply  to  your personal and  secret telegramNo. J of 8th instant.  Please communicate the following to Mr. Winston Churchill:      &quot;In order to obviate possible misinterpretation arising,  mutilation  or otherwise,I beg to repeat back salient points of your message as understood by me.     &quot;I note  your assumption of the direction of the Cabinet&apos;s policy  in Mesopotamia.     &quot;I gather that my  estimate from 1922 onward, of one division for Baghdadand Mosul Vilayats and one&apos;brigacle for Basra Vilayat as irreducible  minimum com-patible acceptance of Mandate, has been rejected as still too costly.     &quot; 1. note  that  Mandate has been accepted, but that nevertheless the withdrawalof British garrison from Mesopotamia is intended, and will commence  with withdrawal from  Mosul as soon as tail of Ironside&apos;s force reaches Khanikin, and that thereafterHis  Majesty&apos;s Government hope  to assure peaceful development of this country byless costly means.     &quot; I learn that you personally contemplate carrying out this policy by the creationof an Imperial Police Force (? assisted by) Indian volunteer units,  also by a systemof air control.     &quot; As regards above, your telegram No. 1  gave me the clear impression  that you were conveying to me  decisions  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government,  both  as  to policy and plans ; if that is the case, I  am  constrained to let you know- at once that I am notprepared to associate myself with one or the other, and if pressed to do so, must, withdeep regret, ask  His Majesty&apos;s Government to accept (? my) resignation.     &quot; If, on the  other hand, they were not decisions for my (? guidance), but proposalsfor my comment, I shall, on hearing that from you, send reply in detail with, referenceto your telegram 87463, which has since reached me.&quot;                               Answered by No. 10.5           From General Raldane, Mesopotamia, to Secretary of Slate,                               13th January 1921.    Your personal and  secret telegrams,  through India  Office,  No. 1,  dated 8thJanuary, received.    1. My views from a  military point of view  as to  the necessary garrisons thiscountry  as  a whole, and for the Basra villayet  alone,  were  expressed  in my0/2088/5-1, dated  15th November,  and my X.  94-5,  dated 21st December, to  you.
In my opinion, if chaos is to  be  avoided  no  reduction  in  the  forces  already sanctioned  in  Troopers  867(33 D.M.O.,  dated  1st  November,  can be  made untilArabs, or other forces, have proved themselves able to take the place of our troops,both for  maintaining internal order and for resisting external aggression.    2. As regards the Air Force scheme, see my 0/184/106 dated 25th November.    As a result of experience during 1.920 1 do  not consider that the scheme, whichwould involve a large reduction of  troops, could  be  applied to  Mesopotamia withoutgrave risks until  the  Royal Air Force have proved  that they can maintain law andorder in  the country.    Though a  valuable  auxiliary, I do  not  consider the  Royal Air Force  can yet  beconsidered as a primary force.   For final restoration of order in any disturbed area andfor (? protection of) communication, land forces are essential, and until the Royal AirForce are in a position to carry out the functions  of transporting  troops and warmaterial all  communication  to air stations must be adequately guarded.   For therelief of  invested (? posts), land forces and transport  are essential.    I have  begun to experiment  air control on the Upper Euphrates, and  proposedepending on  that force to maintain order in  the Middle Euphrates area betweenHillah and Nasiriyah, to which I have allotted  no troops.    Neither of these  involved outlying air  stations, with small garrisons liable to be invested as  Air Force, will be supplied from Baghdad or Shaibah,     To apply this control, at Mosul and  Kirkuk would  be dangerous.   These areas are contiguous to the Turkish frontier  and  aerodomes would  be liable to attack  byartillery.  Immediate relief  of  garrisons  might be necessary  and  external attack would be certain to cause internal disturbances,  to repress  which all my mobile forces would be required.  There  is ample evidence  of  intention  on the part of the Turks tomake an attack  on  Mosul and  reduction of  troops there would precipitate  their actions.     3. I have  received your 87463, dated 10th  January, and will reply after further consultation with Sir Percy Cox.6           From Secretary of State to High Commissioner, Mesopotamia,                               ]oth January 1921.    Priority A.    314.   Personal  and  Secret,  Secretary of State for India&apos;s  telegram of  the9th instant.  We must carefully distinguish between policy and method.   Do you think that Feisal is the right man  and the best man ?  Failing him, do  you preferAbdullah  to  any local  man?  Have you put forward  Feisal  because  you considertaking a long view he is the best man or as a desperate  expedient  in  the  hopes of reducing the garrisons quickly ?  If you are really convinced  that Feisal is necessary,can you make sure he is chosen locally ?  Once I know your true mind on these pointsdecision can be taken here immediately.  We can then consider method of  bringing about what we have decided on  in tho most favourable and diplomatic manner.   1 do*not think Cabinet would allow French objection to debar us from taking the best course.I do not think it would  be impossible to placate the French  provided matters  arehandled with them candidly and courteously.  Anyhow, do not let us slip into takingthe wrong man against our better judgment.    Part  II.  Telegraph to me separately explaining  when you propose  national assembly should meet and  what its basis of  election will be.  I presume  theseconditions will be prescribed in relation to the end we have in view, namely, the good government of the  country and the  honourable discharge of  our  mandate without undue expense.   Western political methods are not necessarily applicable to the East.Send me full information of your plan.                           Answered hy Nos. 11  and 12.7            From High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, 15th January 1921.                            (Received 16th, 10 a.m.)    Clear the line.    Private and personal.    222 S.  My telegram 186 S.  In view of despatch of General Haldane&apos;s telegram1192 of the 13th instant, and the possibility of its urgent consideration by the Cabinet,
I venture to submit my comment too, without awaiting the reply to my telegram above-quoted.   I will first comment on General Officer Commanding^ telegram.     Vara      agree, but  subject to reservation  that provided  that a  division ismaintained  in Baghdad  and Mosul.  Vilayats, and the reduction begins in  BasraVilayat,  I would  be prepared, as far as I  can  see  at present, to risk the reduction toone division and one brigade&apos; by end of 1.921, or spring of 1922.  When 1  say one division  and one  brigade I mean strength of trained forces, with necessary proportionof British to  Indians,  whether  they are  called Imperial Police, or Volunteers, or byother convenient designation.     Vara. 2, I agree that, while  the Royal Air Force will be a valuable auxiliary, itcan be nothing more  for present  purposes, and its employment  will not necessarilyallow reduction ot land forces below my minimum  estimate.  We have to remember,moreover, that it is a  most expensive arm to maintain.     With the rest of General Officer Commanding^ telegram I generally concur.     I now offer  comment on your telegram.     My  primary  observation is that the evacuation of  the Mosul Vilayat, at the timeproposed by you or at anytime before  the National  Government, or  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are  in a  position  to replace  our  troops by other forces, is incompatible with acceptance of mandate.     Secondly, I am sure neither your proposal nor the efforts of National Government tocreate their own forces can sufficiently materialise in time to admit of commencement&apos;of evacuation on arrival of General lronside&apos;s forces at  Khanikin.   General HaldaneVobservation that  he could begin to withdraw from Mosul at  that moment,  was simplya statement of military possibilities, made without consultation with me, and taking no account of the political aspect of such a project, or  of the chaos which would result, ifit were put into execution.  I took steps to make this  clear directly his telegram  was shown me.     I fear that you  attach, much  too much importance to effect of suppression of present  rebellion  and the collection of 50,000 rides in the process.  Provided thatthey are  not again subjected to violent propaganda  from outside, and that forces forthe  maintenance of   internal security are not prematurely reduced  below the  safeminimum, I had every hope that  lesson  which they have  now learned will  last the tribes some time.  (? But we) must remember that those of lower Euphrates  aretraditionally prone to  rise against  authority,  whenever they realise that the Govern-rhent is  weak,  and it is not  safe  to assume  that if  our  armed  strength is undulyweakened and propaganda renewed, they could not be got to rise again.  In tiny case,the  future of the Government depends  on. its ability to collect  revenue, and these&apos;tribes will, never pay revenue  unless they know  that Central Government  is in aposition to enforce payment in the last resort.   It is true that 50,000 rifles will havebeen collected during our military operations, but fresh supplies are  all the time&apos;coming  in, ami Jaafar Pasha,  who  has  just returned  from a tour in the disturbeddistricts  estimates that there are still 300,000 rifles in Irak.     In conclusion, I  venture  to touch  upon,personal  question.   You are aware  thatafter two or three weeks of discussion  in London I was assured that His majesty&apos;s government had  definitely decided to accept mandate and to stay where they  now areas long as it was necessary to maintain their obligation(s) under it.   On this assurancef agreed to come out and undertook to  devote all  my (? efforts) first to the earlyformation of a National Government and then  to speedy creation of national forces inorder to  relieve His Majesty&apos;s Government  gradually of the great expense at presentborne by them in the  maintenance of their army in this country.   So far I have not(?  failed in) my  part of the task, and, although  I have, many difficulties to  contendwith and many others ahead, I have every (?hope of) continuing to make satisfactory progress towards the  end in view, provided that pace is not unduly forced.     I can assure you  that premature evacuation, or even talk of evacuation, especially at the moment when  we are by no means free from menace of hostilities from  the-north, in the  spring  will inevitably be cause  of the collapse not only of  the presentprovisional Government  but of whole machinery of civil administration in Baghdad.and Mosul vilayats&apos;now in critical state of transition.     I will reply separately regarding itinerary of your proposed visit to Mesopotamia; after further consultation with General.  Officer Commanding-in-Chief to whom lam.giving a copy of this telegram.

Your 87163, dated 10th January,    T  have  suggested  the  immediate  reduction  of  No. 5  Medium Battery, andintend  to  propose to  War Office on completion of operations  the reduction of theLatteries of the Field Artillery Brigade from six to four guns each.    Labour is being reduced  by some 10,000.    Any other reduction that may prove possible I will put  forward.    Paras. 2 and  3 noted.    Para.  -1.  The following  is proposed  for  your  tour.  Sir  Percy and  1 will  meetyou at  Basrah, where you would see local  notables.    From Basrah to Baghdad by rail via Nasiriya and Hi Hah ;  from Baghdad to Mosulby rail and road; from  Mosul visit outposts and then  proceed via Kirkuk to Sulai-maniya, and back to Baghdad via  Kirkuk and Kim(? dir)ban.   From  Baghdad  visitFallujah, Ramadi and Hit on  the Upper Euphrates, also  Karbala and Nejef and returnBaghdad, proceed Basra by rail to Kut-el-Amara and thence by river.  Climate may bevariable;  bedding,  summer  and winter clothing and sun  hat,  preferably CawnporeTent Club pattern, should  be  brought.9    From General Haldane, Baghdad, to Secretary of Stale, VJtk January 1921.    Clear the line.    X. 1247.  Personal.   Continuation my X.  1244, dated 19th.   Your 87463, dated10th, para. 1.    I have been considering the possibility of withdrawing to  Baghdad a cavalry regiment  from the  Upper  Euphrates which  might later  be dispensed with,  andtrusting entirely to (? aeroplanes) for maintenance of order beyond  Fallujah.   I askedopinion  of  High Commissioner  with  regard   to  bearing of  proposal  on  civil administration.    %. His view  is that  withdrawal of the garrison now would be misunderstood bythe population who would apprehend  that they  were  being left in  the  lurch.Lawlessness  would spread, a risk we  cannot afford  at present when  position atDair-Ez-Zor is uncertain.   All revenue from Upper Euphrates area would be lost andBritish personnel would have to be withdrawn.    3. The estimated revenue from the Upper Euphrates area amounts to Rs. 8f lakhs.And the cost of a cavalry regiment in  the area to probably 10O,000Z.   The savingfrom  withdrawal  would   not  compensate  for the  state of  lawlessness within ourboundaries which would  ensue.  I am  therefore compelled  for  the present to putaside  my proposals.10        From Secretary of State to High Commissioner, Mesopotamia,                              2&apos;Srd January 1921.    Priority A. 1   .$3.  Personal and Secret.    1. I am sorry to receive your telegram 186 S., but 1 hope that its tone is  due tomisunderstanding.  I intend to try my utmost to preserve our control of Mesopotamia,and it is only if every scheme for reducing the present enormous military expenditure is rejected by those on the spot, and if no less costly methods can be  devised, that theconsequences indicated in my No. 1 will follow.   It would surely  be worth while toexamine alternative methods patiently and considerately.   No province in  the  BritishEmpire has ever been acquired by marching in and maintaining a large regular army at the cost of the British Exchequer, but always by skilful and careful  improvisationsadapted to its special needs.  We have still  several months in which to decide whether any of these methods are feasible.  Meanwhile you are wrong to suppose that  yourscheme of setting up one of the SherrifPs sons as local ruler has  been rejected  as awhole, and if you had waited to receive  my further telegram this would have  been clear to you.      mi                               $
11           From High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, 2ith January 1921.     1049                              (Received 11.15 a.m.)    Clear the line.    258 S.  Persouai and secret.   Your telegram of the 15th January, 344.  I havedelayed replying  in the hope that some of the  parties concerned would show theirhand, or ventilate their opinion.   During the  month which has passed since I madesuggestions regarding Faisal, situation has developed on the following lines :     Firstly, Saiyid Talib has specifically conveyed to me through his British Adviser,that he has definitely abandoned intention of becoming the  candidate  for Amirate ofMesopotamia, and proposes to cease propaganding for that purpose.    On receipt of above intimation, I had no doubt that there was something behind it, and have since found following explanation.    The  Naqib  when  he  first  took office  at  my  urgent  instance disclaimed allambition to compete for Sultanate.   Since then he has never again  referred to  thesubject, except to express the opinion that Shereefs  family have no right  to look inthe direction of Irak&apos;.  I have lately learnt, however, from a confidential  employee ofhis, that he does  now wish  to  be a candidate  in  the interests of  his  children.  Itappears that he recently broached  the  subject to Saiyid Talib and  asked latter tQ     *    2.  I quite understand  your difficulties, and you  in  your turn ought  to  try  torealise  the difficulties which exist at home and face the inexorable facts.   For instance,we have spent over 30,000,000/.. on military expenditure in Mesopotamia  in  1920-21.We are probably committed to a further 25,000,000/. in 1921-22.  You now proposefor several years after 1921-22 a garrison  of  one  division, one  brigade, and line  ofcommunication troops, which, with the Air Force, would not costless than 12,000,000/.or  11,000,000/. a year.  .1 do not think there is the slightest chance of  the Cabinet  orParliament agreeing to expenditure on such a scale for a country which we  only  holdunder  the League of Nations  and are pledged to return to the Arabs at the earliestpossible moment.  The maintenance of the  British  Navy  itself  may well turn uponthe expenditure of 12,000,000/.  or 14,000,000/.  a year   on new construction.  TheChancellor of the Exchequer does  not know which  way to turn for money, and thewhole  country is furious at the present rate of expenditure, no part of  which is moreassailed than money spent in Mesopotamia.     3. I have undertaken very  reluctantly. to face this  storm and difficulty  in thehope that all British work  and sacrifice in  Mesopotamia  may not  be  cast  away, and I  have  a  right to loyal aid  and support from  the men on  the spot.  I am not committed to any particular  alternative method  of providing  the  force  necessaryto  sustain  the  Aral) Government, but 1 am determined  that  every  avenue shall  bepromptly and thoroughly  explored.  For  this reason I have set up  without a day&apos;sdelay the Committees which are necessary.     4. Why should you assume that ordinary regular troops  organised  in divisions and brigades, with their lavish and ponderous staffs,  are  the only  form  in  whichthe requisite element of force can be supplied ?  Surely it is worth while considering whether a smaller  number of men  of much higher individual  quality would  not  be just as effective and less costly to  maintain.  Again, Air Marshal  Trenchard,  whohas great experience not only of the air, but  of  the Mohammedan  population  of west  Africa, has  elaborated  in  full detail a  scheme for maintaining control  oncepeace  and order have been re-established.  Thirdly, there is the question of whetherthe Indian troops who will be  required in  support of the Arab Government  cannot  bebetter  raised specially for Mesopotamian service, and whether a higher efficiency andmore British officers and approportion of British non-commissioned officers per  unitwould   not  enable  the same  work  to  be done by fewer men with a consequentdiminution in the difficulties of supply.     5. If all  alternative methods fail and we have to choose between an indefiniterecurring charge of 12,000,000/.  or 14,000,000/. a year  or retirement to  Basra andthe immediate coastal zone.  I have no doubt whatever  that  the retirement will  be ordered.  You would&apos;take a  great  responsibility  if, before any such  decision  hasbeen taken, you  deprived  His Majesty&apos;s Government  of  your local  knowledge and influence, and thus diminished gravely the chances of a satisfactory solution.                               Answered by No. 13.
 12            From High Commissioner, ^Baghdad, 2-1/// January 11)21.                              (Received 25th, 10 a.in.)     Clear the line.     251) S.  Personal and secret.   In continuation of  my telegram No. 258  S.   On the other hand there is a growing faction here both  among the extremist  politicians who want;  no  mandate, and  the moderates  who would accept it, who  profess  to consider that  Sherif family have discredited themselves  by their  hostility  to  the Turks  and  the Caliph,  and  that  the  interests of Irak would  be  best  served  by introduction of a Turkish Prince.   They advocate this also on the ground that under a Turkish Prince the Sunnis will  be better able to maintain their predominance over the Shiahs, both in administration and in  matters of  religion, and secondly, because they think that control of mandate will be lighter with a Turkish ruler than with, an Arab.   One who is  in close touch with Nationalist elements here, expresses confident opinion that among politicians of  Baghdad the candidates for  Amirate now stand in the following  order: (1)  Turkish Prince,  (2) son of Sherif, (o) Naqib,  with little following, and (1) Talib, with still less     The trend of opinion in  favour of a Turk is significant and I think  dangerous to our interests.   I  also  notice considerable  disinclination on  the part  of   the present Government to  give Shiahs  reasonable  share in  it.   As to considerations which prompted my suggestion  regarding  Faisal, I believed then, and believe now, that one of the sons of Sherif would be welcome to considerable  majority of  people of Irak.  They know nothing about  their  individuals and would probably  expect Abdulla, as  he was  nominated last year, but I  do not  think that they would care which it was.     I suggested Faisal, not because I have any personal knowledge  of any of them, but because I thought that his experience during the  war would make him the most competent and effective  for the  urgent  work of creating an army, and because I thought that he had the most prestige.  Abdulla,  as far as I know, is less competent, but more  friendly ;  while Jafar  Pasha and his  friends are favouring Zaid on  the ground  that he is young, and could be trained.  I do not think from (.w) the Irak much matters  which.     As regards election, I only received the final printed  draft of electoral law  for scrutiny a few days ago,  and it will take some days to deal with.  Meanwhile, I  find strong feeling among  the  Arab officials recently nominated to  posts in  provinces under the new scheme that they would like  to give time to get into  the  saddle  andlearn.their districts  before they  are  confronted  with the possibly  serious  worries connected  with an election  months of (sic)  Uamazan fall in (sic) May, and they must either be got. over  before that, which may be difficult, or postponed till it is over, pros and cons requiring further thought.     In any case it is useless, in  my opinion, starting election until the mandate is published  and the effect  known.   I hope that publication will  take  the wind out of the sails of the &quot; No Mandate &quot; party, but it is impossible to say for certain, and it isno less important for us than  for the general public  to know where we are in  this connection before the elections are brought on.  I am of opinion that mandate must first be published.   Then if  we wish to  let Sherifs family  enter  the list,  as i recommend, we should let him offer himself and see result.3321Csupport his candidature, Talib agreed to do so, and hence hitters communication tome, but his real motive in doing so, is  that he believes  Naqib&apos;s days are numberedand that he himself would then step into his shoes.  As regards people  of Irak it isproved by documents which have recently come into our  possession that last spring-all  the  principal Shiah  Sheikhs on  the  Lower Euphrates who have  been leadersof recent  insurrections were in communication  with Faisal and Abdulla  or theiragents and were congratulating one on his success in Syria and urging other  to  come over to Mesopotamia.    There is also, no doubt, that these  Shiah tribes  still want a Sherif,  because they believe that Sherif and his family are  more favourable to Shiah  than a member ofany other  Suuni family would be.
13         From High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, 2Qth January  1.021.       .1223                            (Received 28 th, 12 noon.)    273 S.  Personal and Secret.  Your personal and  secret telegram  No. 33, dated22nd  January.   Your telegram No. 1  denned the policy of the Cabinet precisely for my guidance, and  wording of it as received by me appeared to convey clearly that,though they had accepted mandate, it was fixed intention of His Majesty^ Governmentto evacuate Mosul as soon after the  1st April  as Gen. Ironside&apos;s rearguard  reachedKhanikin.   My  acceptance of this course  was assumed in  spite of my telegrams104 and 119 S.,  which had fully explained  impossibility of such withdrawal consistently with  acceptation of  mandate.  Such  a  decision  left me,  and would  leave me  no alternative but  immediate  resignation, with  the fullest sense of responsibility.    The method by which you contemplated carrying  out the policy above was onewhich might, or might not, prove feasible after examination, but in  any case could not possibly have taken shape in  time  to replace troops before their proposed withdrawalin the spring or early summer.    The proposal to which 1 referred as  having been rejected as a whole, was not primarily the introduction of Faisal, but the reduction of the mandatory troops to one division and one brigade  after one year to  which  the proposal of the introduction ofFaisal was to be an accompaniment.  With the above explanation 1 may say that I fully appreciate the  very  difficult  position  in  which the Cabinet  is placed,  in matter ofexpenditure, and 1. am entirely with yon as to absolute necessity of cutting it down,and ready  to  co-operate  in exploring  every  avenue  for  so doing, promptly andthoroughly, provided that, during the process of  investigation or experiment  nopremature action in the direction of withdrawal or reduction below the safe minimumis taken.-Cox.                              Answered by No. 17.14       From Secretary of State to General Haldane, 26/7* January 1921.    Please comment  on  the  following: &quot;In the event of Cabinet  deciding uponevacuation of Mesopotamia and withdrawal to  immediate vicinity of Basrah town,bulk of our troops to remain in the country till hot weather is over.   All preparations to be made meanwhile for the swiftest possible evacuation after that period.  Stores,munitions, &amp;c, to be  sent  out of the  country continually,-&apos;meanwhile&apos;.   No detach-ments  to  be allowed beyond  railheads, which would compromise the speed of thegeneral withdrawal once  it has begun.  On this  basis, what would be the maximum rate of withdraAval  if it  began in September ?  What are the limiting factors whichprevent your  moving  the  troops thus cleared of stores, refugees, &amp;c, out of thecountry in three months,  so that by  31st  December  we  shall be responsible fornothing outside Basrah town?   I do not at all understand why you should find  any difficulty  iu executing this operation  provided your communications are clear  and your troops are all on rail and river communications by 21st September.  To move90,000 men  along a railway and two  rivers in three months is surely a very moderatedemand, i.e., only .1,000 men a clay.   You should assume that the port of  Basrah willbe kept fully supplied with shipping, so that all echelons can be embarked as soon asthey arrive.   Do not concern yourself with the shipping problem at all, nor with anyother consideration than the purely military operation.&quot;.15       From Secretary of State to General Hdldane, 2Sth January 1921.  -    Clear the line.    Personal,  and  Secret.    Quartermaster-General  states  we  were  feeding  on1st December 1920, in Mesopotamia and Persia :     British,  19,300;  natives,  80,117;  native followers, 46,400;  native  labourers,23,746; local labourers, 13,501;  civilians, 3,310;  refugees, 33,351.  Total personnel,225,785.   Animals (principally donkeys), 53,198.    This is no doubt one of the reasons why we are being driven out of  the provinceby the expense.  Let me have as soon as  possible your own  anticipated programme
-of  reductions under  all or any of these heads  on the basis of (a) the two division standard, (b) the one division  standard  plus auxiliaries  in  both cases.   You will receive a further telegram on this subjects from troopers..16            From General Haldane, Baghdad, to Secretary of State,                               2nd February 1921.     Clear the line.     Your 87003, 27th.     1. I assume the following conditions in my reply below :--       (a) That decision to evacuate country, with the  exception of  Basrah, will be             communicated  to  me  before  the end  of March  so  that all  surplus             munitions, stores, &amp;c, and  refugees can  be cleared before the (? final)             movement of troops begins.       (6) That peace conditions, external and internal, will prevail.     2. The limiting factors  in respect to speedy movement are the  (? traffic) capacity-of  the  various  means  of transporting  troops.  These  are: Railway, Shergat  toBaghdad.  Railway, Kingarban to Baghdad.   Railway, Baghdad to  (? Kut-el-Ainara).River, Kut-cl-Amara to Basrah.   The first  three  (?may  be) ignored as the ruling-factor is the fourth.     3.  By April the Inland Water Transport will have  been reduced to a fleet capable&apos;0f  delivering 600  tons daily.   With this  fleet the movement of the  force down riverwill take 51 months.     4. If the movement of troops from Mosul and Kirkuk be begun on 1st september the withdrawal could be completed by the end of February.     5. If conditions permit of use of the Baghdad-Basrah Railway  and the DisposalsBoard have not sold out of  country the vessels now being handed over to them, the speed of withdrawal could be increased  slightly and the movement completed by endof January.     The  Baghdad-Basrah Railway  however cannot be used without  risk which  itwould not be justifiable to accept.17  From Secretary of Stale to High Commissioner, Baghdad, 1th February 1921.     Personal and secret.   Many thanks for  your 273 S.  I quite understand yourposition and sympathise with it.   Position here is also very difficult.18           From Secretary of State to High Commissioner, Baqltdad,                               1th February 1921.    Clear the line.    No.  SI.   Personal and  Secret.   The  questions at issue  cannot be  settled byinterchange of telegrams.  I cannot, in view of approaching Imperial Conference, find time to visit Mesopotamia.   I  propose therefore a conference in Egypt  beginningduring first or second week of March.   A light  cruiser can bring &quot;you from Basra toSuez in  approximately seven days.   Conference would  take  a week.  You  could therefore be back in Mesopotamia after absence of less than a month.  I should wishyou to  bring with you General Haldane and General Ironside, also your chief financial adviser.  I.  shall  be  accompanied&apos;by principal officers  of   new Middle  EasternDepartment of Colonial Office.    Main questions to be settled are following: First, the new ruler.  Second, futuresize, character and  organisation of  the future  garrison.   Third, the  time-table of reduction from present strength to that garrison.  Fourth, total amount of the grant-
in-aid.  Fifth, arising out of above the extent of territory to be held and administered-    After such a conference I shall be in a position to make definite recommendations to the Cabinet for action.    I shall also endeavour to  use  this conference as an occasion for getting  into-personal touch with the various British authorities in the  Middle  Eastern trianglewho are being  placed  under the authority of  the Colonial Office, such as Resident ofBushire, High Commissioner of Palestine  and Administrator of Aden, who are  also-being summoned.     New department will comprise within its sphere an effective control of all factors in the Arabian problem.   It is greatly to be hoped  that  the Inter-Allied Conferencesummoned in London for 21st February will revise Treaty of Sevres so as to secure a real peace with Turkey.  I hope this result will  be  known  to us at the time of our discussions.     I am sorry to put you to this trouble,  but it is absolutely necessary and I cannot do more than meet you half-way,  I must  therefore  request you to facilitate carryingout of my proposal to the utmost of your power ; but of course, if you consider yourabsence from your post for nearly a month woidd be disastrous, you should  state yourcase.  In  the event of a conference being impossible, I shall  then have to come to decisions here as to the actual course to be followed.   If conference in Egypt provesfeasible, it is desirable that we should have our hands as free as possible in order totake the best decisions from a central point of view.     Show  this to the General and reply as soon as possible  in order that exact datescan be fixed.
