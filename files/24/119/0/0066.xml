(C ircu3.a ted by the Chief Secretary for Ireland).                I submit for the consideration of the Cabinet  my     survey for the week ended the 7th instant.     GENERAL .ST&apos;ATr 0? THr COUNTRY,     Statistics of Ov.t.i.?res,            I regret to state that the campaign of outrage against     the Forces of the Crown continues with  unabated intensity.     Sixteen ambushes and three ettpcks on occupied  barracks  took     place during the week and in acWMdon ten attempted assassinations     cf individual policemen or scic^crr were reported.    The  casualty     list for the week ended the 5th instant is the  highest on record,     both as regards the total casualties  (40) and the number  cf     Crown servants killed (SI) since the  Easter Rebellion of  1V16.            The worst ambush of the week was that at Drumkeen,     Newpallas District- Co, Limerick,  which took place  about  Z  p^m,     on the 3rd instant, when two cars containing a  District  Inspector     and twelve men were attacked by a party numbering about  two     hundred men, armed with bombs9 revolvers and rifles*  Nine  of     the police were killed outright and two were seriously wounded     and died subsequently.,   The appearance and position of  the     bodies of the murdered men suggest that some of them were     deliberately put to death after being rendered  helpless by%    their wounds,.   Another terrible affair which also  resulted     in the loss of several gallant lives  ocouri^d near  Bellinalee,     CCo Longford on the 2nd instant.   A  party of eighteen Auxiliary
xlice  returning  to  Longford  from  Gran&amp;rd  in two motor  tenders were ambushec  about 8  pdfru mid-way between Granard  and Ballii.ial.eeo    The fir at  oar-  was put  out of action by a mine laid  aorose the road and  worked by an electric switch from an adjoining fieldo     The police at once dismounted and offered  a  vigorous defence for more than  an hour, but were eventually compelled  to  surrender owing  to exhaustion cf their ammunition.  Four  of the Auxiliaries were killed -or died from the effects ef  their wounds? and seven others were wounded.,    Tne atbackers  are believed  to have  suffered heavy  casualties in this engagements       A feature  of  th&amp;fweek  has been the  increased  frequency of bomb attacks  upon police  and military lorries  in the streets of Dublino    No  less than seven  such  outrages  took place  during the week and  although the only  casualties inflicted  upon the  Grown Forces  were two  cases of slight. wounding,  one  inncoent civilian  (a boy Of four) was killed and fourteen were injured  as a result cf  these attacksP The General  Officer Commanding Dublin Districtf  who is also the Competent  Military Authority, has announced  in  the Press that  if these  outrages continue  it may be necessary for the safety cf  the  general public to  impose more  stringent Curfew restrictions on the crc.ya       Five Sinn Fein murders of  civilians were reported during the weeks   This  number includes  the  case  of the wife of a  District Inspector  of the Royal Irish  Constabulary who was shot  dead in the presence cf her husband near the  Railway Station at Mallow,,   (Co,  Cork)  *   The dastardly nature  of  this outrage is hardly affected by the fact  that the  intended victim cf  the assassins  was  presumably the  District Inspector himself and not his wifeB       ,Minor outrages for the week were  comparatively lighte
i      Raids for arms inoro^yofl from 6 to 18, but raids on mails      foil to 12 which it-: the lo-tfoct fi).niro recorded for the class      of outingo for toverai months pauta           -irrocts for outrages and political offences numbered      9V for the wook.      Trials of Civilians by Court Itotj-aJL           Eighty-four trials of civilians by Court ilartial took      place during tho wook, and sixty- is convictions were obtained.      Tho following is on analysis of tb&quot; ,sontonoca imposed:         3  Sentences of death (one commuted to ponal servitude                                    for: life)       24   Sentences of penal servitude (&apos;6 years to 15 years)        16  Sentences of imprisoiimont with hard labour (56 days to                                                  2 years)        10  Sentences of imprisonment without hard labour (two months               v                                   to 21 months)         8  Fines (10 Shillings to  50).         1  Forfeiture of arms.Total   61           In four of the remaining five cases tho sentences were      remittee by the Confining Officer, and in the fifth Case the      accused was required to outer into his own recognizances to      keep the peace for six months.           The commuted death sentence was that of Joseuh Murphy      whoso appeal on tho. ground of a misruling of evidence by the      Court i,iartial was disallowed by tho High Court.   The reprieve      was granted by the Ccmmonder-in-Chief purely as an act of mercy      in view of the successive postponement of execution pending the      hearing of the, appeal.   The other death sentence was that of      a farmer who was convicted of having a fully loaded.revolver      in the iiartial Lav; area.   The sentence in this case was oafried      out by shooting.   Seven of the cases trio i were cases of      ordinary crime, and the remainder offences arising out cf      tho present state of the country.    Four cases were charges      of looting against members of the hoyal Irish Constabulary in

The Lenten pastoral letters cf tho Roman Catholic Archbishops  and Bishops of Ireland are to a greater  extent than usual of the nature  of  political  manifestos,and, having regard  to  the differences of political opinion which are known to exist arising &apos;oho hierarchy,  are remarkably unanimous  in their broad  declarations  on  policy.    Although, as  was  to be expected,  containing strong  expressions of  criticism of  the Government and Irish Administration, they unite  in condemning the  employment of methods of violence  for political  purposes as contrary  to the Law of the  Church,  and as  calculated  tobring in their train greater evils than they  are intended toremove   The Pastoral:of Dr. Ooholan, Bishop of Cork, who is avowedly ja strong Sinn Feinor, is of special  significance, not only . orf&apos;
its uncompromising pronouncement that as &quot;Ireland is not a sovereign independent state, the physical force policy isunlawful&quot;, but for its advice/  iven. unmistakably althoughby way of suggestion, that the expedient and, proper course for the electors of Southern Ireland to adept is to acceptthe Home Rule Act with suoh amendments: as are obtainable,rather than to submit themselves to the intolerable alternaof Crown Colony rule for an indefinite periods(IntdU)    H.G.Chief Secretary&apos;8 Office,        Dublin Castle.February 9th, 1921*
