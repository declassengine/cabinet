(P 8$3) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 18(33&apos; \m February 1921.(Received 14th, 10 a.m.)Priority A.196 S. Afghanistan. Your telegram of I lth, February, No. 1032, has beenrepeated to Dobbs for information and guidance with following comments : &quot; Government of India apprehend that it may now prove practically impossibleto expunge all reference to Afghan interest in our tribes, but you will of course makeevery endeavour to do so. If, however, you find your hands forced, you might seeksolution in carefully-balanced bilateral formula, in which interest is whittled down toinnocuous minimum, and in which specific reference to Afghan origin is omitted.Difficulty, of course, would be so to word it, as to get it past Afghan Government.But this is the sort of thing Government of India have in mind.&quot; &apos; Further for the better promotion of neighbourly relations, more especially inFrontier matters, appertaining on the one hand to the Pathan tribes within theBritish border, in whose welfare sentiment of: the Afghan nation is naturallyconcerned by reason of their proximity to the Afghan border, and appertaining onthe other hand to the tribes within the Afghan border, whose welfare reacts similarlyon British territory, it is agreed,&apos; &amp;c, down to &apos; betterment of tribes.&apos;&quot;It is understood that your proposal regarding exchange of visits is of restrictedcharacter approved by the Secretary of State (vide Mussoorie proceedings, 10thMeeting). Unless you see reasons to the contrary, interchange of visits betweenPolitical Agent at Kurranr and Governor of Khost had better be avoided, and visitsgenerally restricted in all, or at any rate on either side to, say, one a year.&quot; It is presumably still open to you to say that Government will not authoriseyou to adopt the face-saving formula unless, and until they are satisfied that generalsatisfactory settlement is in sight. How far this would be your best tactics, youalone can judge.&quot;
