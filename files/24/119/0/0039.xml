Volunteers toparade twice  a week.   Retired officers to be appointed drill instructors.  Studentsabout  17  to be enrolled.  If  movement develops, Local  Governments have amplepowers  under Act 1-1,  1908,  and have (?.already)  informed us,  on general questionof volunteers, that no action  is immediately necessary, but that, if required, Act 1-1should be applied.     Bombay.-Shankat  Ali,  in  supporting  Yakub Hussan, lecturing on Swaraj,acclaimed  agrarian disturbances in United Provinces as first indication of ultimatesuccess of non-co-operation.     Section 7.  At public meeting, Gandhi  presiding, Mohained Ali&apos;s exhortation tostudents to boycott schools and colleges and follow lead given by Calcutta students,which would win Swaraj, had  no  immediate  effect.  Gandhi  and Ali brothersexpressed great disappointment.     Disturbance occurred in  Mandi quarter,  Bombay City,  on 23rd, in consequencetwo Anglo-Indian boys killing some pigeons ; largo crowd collected  and stoned police,who had to make baton charge.  Several arrests effected, but local  police considered it inadvisable  to press prosecution, in view generally peaceable attitude inhabitants ofquarter.   Abdul Rahman, editor of  local Khilafat daily paper, sentenced at Karachito one year&apos;s rigorous imprisonment on charge of sedition.   Bihar  and Orissa reports breach of the peace at Saniastipur.  A  newly joined assistant struck a  coolie forstealing sugar-cane, who at once  lay down and  complained of being seriously  hurt.Coolies believing him to be dying, made dash at  assistant, who  saved himself  fromserious injury by climbing up building.  Coolie picked up by two other  europeans and  taken to  hospital,  examined by assistant  surgeon, who found nothing  wrong.Motored  back  by  Europeans to within  2  miles of  village and walked home.  Coolies,however, greatly  excited by this, and fact that another boy  by accident fell into  a vatof boiling sugar, got out of hand.  Superintending engineer, factory, endeavouring topacify them,  was  assaulted  with  lathi  and had his nose  fractured.  Two  otherEuropeans also  reported hurt, but not seriously.   Twenty-five  armed police  sent toSamastipur to protect factory should any further attempt be made.  Work will not be resumed  there until excitement subsides.     Section 8.  General. Dress has  been mainly concerned with strike of Calcuttastudents, to whom Gandhi wrote a message of  encouragement.  Cost of reforms,especially salary of Ministers,  being  ventilated  in  papers,  and a notice of  resolutionreceived  in Bihar Council that salary of ministers should be Re. 1.  Opinion, generallyis that Rs. 5,000 is excessive,  that salary should at most be Rs. 2,500.   Letter  about to issue  to Local  Governments regarding non-co-operation movement.  View  takenin letter  is that  success so far attained in execution  of items of programme towardswhich efforts ostensibly directed  have  (ale ?  has) not,  despite recent vigorous  attacks on educational institutions, been very great.   Probable  that campaign will now be largely directed towards other and more dangerous objectives.  Agricultural  tenants and large industrial centres furnish  most promising field  for propaganda of  non-co-operationers.  Efforts to spread discontent  amongst former already  in  Oudh and central  Provinces, and other provinces  may also be  exploited.   Reason,  too, toapprehend  that attempt will be made  to capture labour  organisations as means of bringing about something in nature of general strike.   Not considered that radical change in policy hitherto pursued  is  necessary  at present.  Preferable  to rely on measures  such as (1) close  watch  on attempts to get at rural  areas  and labouringclasses ;  (2)  inchoation of  remedial  legislation  wherever  required ; (3) counterpropaganda;  (4)  vigorous prosecution of non-co-operation agents guilty  of making seditious speeches or inciting to violence;  (5) enforcement  in general  of respect for law, e.g., in case of clearly unlawful assemblies.  Local Governments asked, however,whether they concur in appreciation  of situation  and measures suggested, or havealternative proposals to  put  forward.   There are  rumours that efforts will be  madeto induce servants of Europeans to boycott them, but  so far, except in a few isolated.cases in Bengal, these efforts  have not materialised.
