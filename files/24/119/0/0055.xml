CABINET.

OPIUM TRADE IN THE EASTERN COLONIES.

Memorandum by the Colonial Office.

(Reference Conclusions of an Inter-Departmental Conference held Feb.8th.1921, Minute (V) (II).



1. Supervision of the Traffic in Opium and similar Dangerous Drugs having been entrusted on the Council of the League of Nations, it is desired to draw attention to the special position occupied by certain Eastern Colonies in regard to this traffic, with a view to ensuring that their interests shall not be overlooked by the Advisory Committee which is to be established to assist and advise the Council in dealing with the question.



2. In Hong Kong, Straits Settlements and Federated ? States the trade in Opium has for the last eight or ten years been conducted as a Government Monopoly. The raw material (obtained chiefly by direct purchase from the Government of India), is prepared for consumption under Government arrangements and retailed to the public through licensed vendors at an artificially high price. Profits on the trade go to the Exchequer of the Colonies concerned.

Under the Monopoly system, the local Government is able effectively to regulate the use of the drug, by raising the price, limiting the amount placed on sale, and suppressing smuggling.



3. The Revenue derived by Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements from the Opium Monopoly system during 1921 is estimated as follows:-

         Opium                                  Sterling           Percentage of

         Revenue                                equivalent          total Revenue.

          In tho Fedora-tod Malay Staivea^ tho Estimates for1920 anticipated en Opium Revenue of $12,200,000 ( lr4.. S,333).-&apos;      4*  Qr.lto apart from tho loss to Revenue there aroabundant reasons of a more general natuie for deploringany drastic or ill-considered action in promaturoly suppress-ing ths Opium Traffic in tho Eastorn Colonies.   They may &quot;bebriefly summarized as follows.     (a) the native population, if suddenly deprived of adrug to the enjoyment of which they havo boon a?yjustomed forgenerations, world be snb^ec-led to a very real hardship andinjustice, resentment at which m.ight easily assume an aotivoand dangerous form.   In any event., immigration from China,upon which Malays in particular is very largely dependent for commercial prosperity would bo diverted to other territories.-     fb) Abolition of the Government Monopoly would notabolish the demand for the drug.   A vast increase in contra-band traffic would inevitably ensue, which the re sour cos ofthe Colonial Governments world be powerless to suppress.     Jo) The Opium habit wpuld bo replaced by the far greaterand moro XLnmana^eaMs evils of excessive indulgence in alcohol,.and the craving for morphine, cocaine and similar drugs.Recent developments in China afford ample confirmation of this..      5.   The Governments of the Eastern Colonies have infact strictly complied with the torms of every article oftho Hague Opium Convention of 1912./ although it has not beenin force.   In accordance with Article 5, which prescribesthat measures shall bo taken &quot;for the gradual and effective  ..suppression of the manufacture of, internal trado in,  and useof, prepared Opium, with tints regard to tho varying circumstance-stances of each country concerned, unless regulations on  ,                                                   ... the.
the subject are already in existence&quot;, a consistent policy has been pursuod of gradually limiting tho consumption andraising tho prico of the prepared article.   In Hong Kong,for example% the average annual consumption of the Chinese -population has boon reduced from 3.24 taols per caput in1912 to .94 taela in 1919.   In tho Straits Settlements theprice of preparod Opium to the consumer has been graduallyraised from $3 per tael in 1910 to f&apos; 2* o in 1919.   ?nreply to a despatch from the Scoretary of Ctate enquiringwhat further stops, consistent with safety, could bo takento comply with Artiole 6 of the Convention, tho governors of Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements in 1319 rooomnwadedcertain administrative moasuros to ensure greater stringencyof control, and limitation of consumption, whioh have binoobeen carried into effect;  they emphatically ezpresBwd thoview, however, that any precipitate or violent departure from tho polioy of &quot;gradual suppression&quot; was certain to prove noi only impracticable but actually dangerous to thowelfare of the Colony,      6.   The foregoing is of necessity a mere outline ofthe case for the Eastern Colonies.   It is hoped, however,,that enough has been said to justify the contention that the speoial interests of Hong Kong and British Malaya demandspecial representation on the Advisory Committee to theCounoil of the League.   Should the appointment of anadditional Member directly representing these Colonies bofound impracticable, it is submitted that the British represent-sentative be specifically Instructed to use every endeavour
to safeguard these interests;  and,  with this ond inview, to maintain a oloso association with tho ColonialOf floe in all matters whereby these  intorosts might  boprejudicially affeoted.   All  available information will,of oourse, bo furnished to him from  tho  Colonial  Office.Colonial office,    10the February, 1931,
