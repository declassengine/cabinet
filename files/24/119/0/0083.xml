JMCUIMI IS gHB PROPERTY Off HIS BRIIiMIO IfcJESTTS GOVKBMEKT.LtJE T.BAILWAY   A ORE :M 13*Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Ministerof iransport.kA my oolleagues are aware, the war-time relationshipof the Government with the Railways whioh started on the4th *ugast, 1914, was upon the basis of the Governmentguaranteeing the Railways their 1913 net reoeipts, duringthe period of &quot;possession&quot;, as it was called, whioh ultimatelybeoame 7 years.m original Agreement was entered into, andsupplementary provisions were disoussed and debated from timeto time.   These took the form of masses of voluminous andoomplioated technical lnstruotion3 to aooountants whioh noone but an expert, thoroughly familiar with railway accounts,can understand, and then only after most absorbed s*tudy.   Iuse no exaggerated language when I say that these Agreementsare a totally incomprehensible mass of print except afterweeks of study and careful tuition from those who haveoperated their provisions. -It sounds quite simple to say:   &quot;he guarantee youyour 1913 net reoeipts, and we will pay the expenses andtake the reoeipts of the undertaking.&quot;   But questionsarise as to what is a legitimate working expense;   as towhat is a proper reoeipt;   as to v/hat should be oharged to\Reserve, and as to what oharge should be entered as aworking expense or against a provision to Reserve;   as to thestandard of maintenance and renewal to be maintained;   as towhether a debit is to capital or to revenue.   In these wayscontroversies of great magnitude arise.
27he Railways spend to-day over  260,000,000sterling, and reooive from the public over  300,000,000sterling per annum.   The differenoo between the two is thoguarantood net reoeipts of 1913, any dofioit being made upby tho Exohequer.After the Ministry of Transport was formod, Irealised that the supplementary iigreemonts, understandings,and instmotions to accountants as interpreted created avery serious position for the State und that the accounts weremany, years in arrears.   It took me months of arduous work,with an able and devoted staff, to clarify the position andto see the gravity of tho situation.   There was no incentiveto economy in day-to-day operation by the Ooayanies, butrather a direct inoontive to extravagance,   ihore was everyinoentive on tho part of the Companies to maintain theirproperty at a full standard at the cost of the State, andin some oases, in my judgment, this incentive has provedtoo strong for the taxpayers1 interests.Uot only did the original Agreement guarantee tothe Railways the net revenue of 1913 - whioh was the mostfavourable year they had ever had in their history - butit also gave them a standard of maintenance and of provisionr.for renewal and depreciation whioh was the most favourablein their existence.Jhe interpretation and supplementary agreementswtd arrangements whioh were from time to time issued by theRailway Executive committee - whioh, my oolleagues willremember, was a Committee of General Managers acting for theBoa?d of !2rade - vastly extended the original Agreement,*kioh I would point out not only secured the Railways Vhe
most favourable year they had ever had, but guaranteed themagainst all the collatoral results of the war - badfluctuations of trade and diminution of revenue due tostrikes;   political disturbances end otherwise - giving theminstead the net revenue of the best year they had ever known.When this position was realised, I appointed .aCommittee known as the Lord Oolwyn Committee on Railwayagreements.   Lord Golwyn was the Chairman, and the othermembers of the Committee woroj-Major Harry Barnes, MoP*Sir Godfrey Collins, M*P.Mr. William Graham, M*P.Sir Har&amp;man Lever, (Treasury Official of theMinistry of transport).Sir Hal ford Maokinder, M9P.Sir Thomas Robinson, Mo P.Sir peter Hylands, (president of the Federationof British Industries).$hat Committee has held an Enquiry, and it hasreported.   A copy of the Report will have been circulatedto the Cabinet by the time this memorandum reaches themembers 0   (lib.e sub j ec t - as any of my col 1 eagues who 3 tu.dythe Re-port will see - is one of extreme complexity, ishighly technical, and is very difficult to grasp clearlyand appreciate,   She Committee is a strong one, and theReport is a momontous document.I enclose the best summary that I can prepare,showing, the result of the Report.   It recommends that thearrangements with the Railways as operated to-day shall bemodified to an extant which would save tho taxpayer amaximum at present-day prices of  156,000,000 sterling pluslarge   undefined claims which a? a threatened and might runto soores or even hundreds of millions.   It takes theline that the original Agreement should be adhered to, andthat the supplementary arrangements which were come to,
536where they have departed from the original agreement, arenot immutable and should bo adjusted on a basis of oquityand in oonformity with the original agreement.I will leave it to the Law Officers of tho Orovmto advise.as to whether, in law, wo can consider thosupplementary arrangements binding or not.   If they arenot binding, the Law Officers will doubtless advise whetheror not we must submit to the decision of the Railway and OanalCommission - the appointed Court for settling differencesin this matter - tho question as to the legal and bindingnature of these arrangements.If the advice is that we are legally bound, or ifthe advioe is that we are not strictly legally bOvnd, we oanadopt one of two oourseso   We can - if we abide by theoonolusions of the Colwyn Committee Report - andeavour tonegotiate a settlement with the Railways.   (I would pointout here that this would have to be an individual settlement,and that thore are some 114 railways - 82 in Great Britainand 32 in Ireland - with eaoh of whioh negotiations vrouldhave to   bo carried out.   She Railways have never yetsuooeeded in providing any negotiating Committee with powersto deal for all).   This prooess would be a very long one,and would present groat difficulties, but the difficultieswould be less and the proooso would be shorter if publicopinion wore strongly in favour of any action whioh we mightdecide to take.If the Railways refuse to negotiate, I know ofonly one other way in which the matter oan be dealt with, andthat is by logiolation.   Legislation will bo the moredifficult if we have to contemplate the eupplomontaryarrangements as binding legal agreements.
537My oolleaguea will not, I hope, expect me in 6first written memorandum to put forward a definiterecommendation as to the oourao we should take on thoColwyn Committee Report.   I would, however, say this -the Report ia the outcome of the moat oareful and aaaiduou8study of a most complicated aubjeot by what I oonsider wasa very strong and able Committee, and they have oonduotedthat study entirely independently.I would add this, that the Committee haa at leastoonfirmed - and in some oasoa in ita reoommendationa had&apos; evengone further than I myself had adjudged - my own oonoluaions.It will also be noted that two members of the Committee -Major Barnes and Kr. Graham - wiahed to go further thanthe unanimous report of the Committee goes.I would remind the Cabinet of two things.   Thiaaum of  156,000,000 means a direot payment from the tax-payer to tho Railways and will have to be inoluded in ourestimates in the immediate future.   I am aubmittingwithin the next few days a supplementary estimate for 21,000,000 to the House of Commons, direotly ariaing outof these agreements. &apos;I would also wish to reoord that even if theColwyn Committee^ Heport wore aooepted by the Railwaysin whole as a whole - and of that there is little or nohfpe - amounts involving large sums would still be indispute, and in the interests of the national purse theutmost vigilance will be required.Recently, on a claim which I pressed on theiadvioe of the Law Officers of the Crown, dating progressivelyback to 1914, - and which would have arisen even if the\
Committee ls recommendation had been in operation - Ireceived ohequos in refund from the Railways for 4,000,000 starling.   Large sums for the interest, evenon that amount, are still outstanding.   Within the weekin whioh I write, I have rooeivod a cheque for  150,000from one railway, and an adjustment in aooount of  250,000from-another,   at the present time, I have stopped inone month the payment of  1.000,000 to ei ht railways, andas will probably havo beon announcod in the papers beforethis memorandum roaches tho Cabinet, tho North BritishRailway has said that it will default in its dividend ifI maintain tho refusal to pay.   I am convinced that paymentshould not in equity bo made.The Cabinet will have to docido - and as thedebate will probably take plaoe on this subject within aweek from tho opening of Parliament, will have to docidoquickly - what instructions it proposes to give mo on thesubjeot of tho Report of Lord Colwyn&apos;s Committee.(Signed)   ERIC GEDDES-11th February, 1981:.
