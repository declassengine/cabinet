LEAGUE Off lUTIOKS.                  O      THE APPOINTMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL             BLOCKADE COMMITTEE      Memorandum by the Seoretarv-Goneral.                                      Geneva,                                         January 24th 1921The Assembly adopted the annexed Report of the Sub-lot re-J  Committee on the Eoonomio Weapon  presented by Committee Ho.6.loduoed 1       Contained in this Report ie  the following Resolution:-0     &quot;The Oounoil should &quot;be asked to appoint an International      Blookade Committee to consider the application of      Article XVI of the Covenant;  the Committee will report      to the Oounoil who shall place the conclusions before      the Assembly at its next Session for their acceptance,      rejection or amendment, without prejudice to any aotion      that my harce been provisionally taken upon them.   The      Committee should not exceed eight in number with power      to summon experts to advise them, and not less than half      its numbers should be persons representing states which      have not a right to permanent membership on the Council.&quot;The Council has to decide whether or not it will adopt therecommendations of the Assembly.POINTS POR CONSIDERATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESOLUTION.1*  Composition of Committee.         The Resolution would seem to imply that the Membersof the Committee are to be representatives of states, appointed by their own Governments on the invitation of the Council,During the discxipsion on the composition of the InternationalBlookade Committee which took place in the Sixth Committee,.the delegates of Great Britain, Prance and Italy expresslystated that their Governments desired to nominate- their ownrepresentatives.                                               .* ..As
JLs regards the Governments which should be invited to nominaterepresentatives, the Resolution raservea at least four places forstatea not entitled to permanent membership on th6 Council.  Itis therefore, open to the Counoil to invite each of the fourpermanent Members of the Council to appoint one representative.The Council will have to determine how the remaining four Membersihould. he chosen.2 *   filiations with,other organs of the League.       The International Blockade Committee is to have powerto summon experts to advise them.   This seems to preclude the selection of  permanent assessors appointed by the Council.  But.inasmuch as the principles and  the application of the EconomicWeapon involve technical considerations of various kinds, theCommitted-will^oubtl^^-oor.sidsr&quot;&quot;1:h4..d.esirability of maintainingcontact with  othor  organs of  the League, more especially theHaval, Mlitaxy-&quot;tin6^idr^.I;omission.-and  the- Provisional. Economicand Financial Committee.   The  International Court of  Justiceshould, also be included, but, as the court is not yet  censtitu-ted.perh&amp;reconstruction the Legal advisers to the Secretariat jmight^reserve  inits  .stead.3*    Immediate stops  in the event of an emergenoy.       The. Report adopted by  the Assembly also deals with  the steps which  should  be taken immediately to render as effective as  possible  the Eoonomio Weapon of  the  League under  Article ..XVI.-It  was decided that as soon as  a member of the League, after taking note  of the  Proces Verbal  of the Council, is  satisfiedthat  a breach of  the  Covenant has ooourred,  it is its  duty totake  measures for  the purpose of  carrying out  the first para-graphs  of Article XVI, viz.,  the  breaking off  of all diplo-ma tit) relai&amp;d^                                      or; otherintercourse  between the rouiAoirbsjmh^                                                ,.,,residing
residing in the ooienant-breaking SI re.    The Report then proceedsi&quot;j?or this purpose the necessary legislation preventing intercourse&quot;between the residents of the two States should be immediately passedaccording to the Constitution of each Member of the League&quot;.        uo:i the International Blockade Committee is set up, it will no doubt recommend uniform legislation, which would oome into force as soon as a State had agreed to a$ply the Economic Wcapon.  It waspointed out in the Report, however$  that the Members of the Leagueare already under an obligation to sever relations with a Covenant-&apos;breaking State; and in view of the possibility of a case arisingbefore the International Blockade Committee has presented its reportto the next Assembly, the Council may consider it advisable forthwith to draw the attention of the Governments to the provisions of theCovenant and the Resolutions of the Assembly are to enquire whatstatutory powers at present exist, enabling each Government to break off relations, and If these are not sufficient, v.-at legislation itwill be necessary to pass to render the blockade effective.       If the exigency contemplated in Article XVI were to arise,the Council would have to act rapidly, and should therefore knowhow far the constitution and laws in force in each country wouldenable the Members of the League to act effectively.  In some countries the necessary powers already reside in the hands of theexecutive authorities.  In others, it would doubtless be necessaryto pass special legislation through Parliament.4,  Enquiry as to statutory powers and prospective legislation.       The Council might therefore address a letter to each Memberof the League, enquiring what measures it would be in a position totake immediately in order to carry out lie obligations under ArticleiTI of the Covenant; what statutory powers the Government at prosentpossesses; and what now legislative measures, if any, it proposes tointroduce In order to obtain the necessary powers.  Such information would moreover facilitate the work of the International BlockadeCommittee when it met.2, 7/hitehall Gardens, S.W.1.February 3rd. 1921..                -3-
