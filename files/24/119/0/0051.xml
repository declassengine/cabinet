THE  NEW TELEPHONE  RATES.      1. The Trunk System has been under  the control of the Post Office since 1890. The National Telephone Company&apos;s local system was  purchased and incorporated in the Post Office system as from 1st January 1912.   The Company&apos;s gross profit in 1911, the last year of their existence, was           Dividends (including debenture interest)    -            739,000          Transfer to Reserve    -.....-  500,000          Royalty paid to the Post Office    -   -    -    -    -  353,000                                                             1,592,000      On  a similar  basis in  1913-14 the Post Office  showed a gross profit  on the combined local system of           Interest on capital      -------   507,1)00          Depreciation -.......-  1,211,000          Surplus......-            390,000                                                             2,114,000 Considerable additional expenditure was thrown on  the Post Office in raising to Post Office rates the wages  and  pensions of the staff transferred from the Company, e.g., (a) the Company&apos;s contribution to Pension Fund was 13,0C0L a year as compared with a  charge of 243,000L  for the  same  employees, when transferred  to the Post Office; (b) the cost of levelling up the wages of the  Company&apos;s staff was  158,0001. per annum.     The  statement which is frequently made that the Company&apos;s profit  disappeared under Government management is apparently arrived;at. by including  interest and depreciation (of which the Company&apos;s reserve is the equivalent) as profits under the Company and working expenses under the Post Office.     2. Prior to the War the Telephone service showed a small but adequate surplus, which in normal conditions  the  rates  then  existing would have sufficed to maintain. Since 1913-14, expenditure has risen, in round figures, from 6,000,000/, to 14,200,000/., while Revenue&quot; has  increased from 6,200,000 . to  9,700,000L leaving a deficit in the current year of 4,500,0001.     The increase of 3,5OO,OO0L in revenue is due  mainly to the development of the service and partly to the increased charges imposed in 1915.  The most important of these increases were           to the trunk fees of 33^  per cent, and the raising of the flat rate from  111.  to 261. in  London  and from 101. to  121. in &quot;the Provinces. These additions are  equivalent  to an average all round  increase of about 8 per cent. Otherwise the rates  payable  by the ordinary subscriber  remain substantially as  they were in 1913-14.     The principal factor in the growth,  of  expenditure is wages, which  account for about two-thirds of the  total cost of the service and have increased by about 6,200,000L Of this 800,0001. is  due to an  increase in numbers caused by  the expansion of  the service, and 5,4O0,0O0Z. is clue to increases of pay, principally in the form of War Bonus, which is paid to the Telephone  staff  in common with other Civil Servants on the scale  agreed upon,  with the  assent of the Government, by the National Whitley Council for the Civil Service.-     Plant costs have more than doubled ;  building charges are on an average260 per cent, above the pre-war level.  The contract  price for the equipment for a full sized Exchange is about 250,000 . as  compared with 78.000L before the War.     3. The new rates will represent an average increase of 67 per cent, oh the current rates or 80  per  cent, on  the  1914  tariff.  The annual  charge will consist  of an installation rental of           s.   d.         8 10   0 in London ;         8  0   0 in Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester; and  .         7 10   0 elsewhere,
together with a uniform message  fee of H-d per  call, covering communication withany Exchange  within 5 miles, of the originating Exchange.  The trunk fees will beincreased by an average of 51 per cent, over the current rates or about 100 per cent.over the pre-war charges.     It is submitted that an average increase of 80 per cent, is not only justified by therise in costs, but is reasonable and moderate when compared with the increased charges for other services.  Railway passenger  rates  have  risen  by 75 per cent, and freight rates by 100 per cent. ; telegraph and postage charges have been doubled ;  MunicipalRates in most districts  have more  than doubled;  a prominent  gas  company hasrecently announced a prospective increase  in its charges  to 120 per cent,  above  thepre-war figure.  In fact the Telephone service can only be worked  with so small anincrease as 80 per cent., because the bulk of the plant  has been installed at pre-warprices with capital borrowed  at pre-war rates of interest.   The capital charges haveconsequently not shown a proportionate increase.  But,.on the other hand, as the pre-warplant is renewed and extended  by plant  purchased at present  prices and  at current rates of interest, the capital charges will rise, and  the  unit cost will tend to increaseunless there is a counteracting fall in prices, especially in the cost of labour.     4.  It is  frequently stated  that increased  costs could be met by developing  thesystem, and that to raise  charges, which will  tend to restrict  development, is short-sighted policy.   It is true that in many undertakings expansion  of business carrieswith it a reduction of  costs, and in the Telephone service this is equally true as regardscertain elements of expenditure such as overhead charges.  But as regards some of themost important items the unit cost will increase rather than diminish as the systemexpands.     The larger the number of subscribers  between  whom intercommunication isrequired, the more complicated and  costly becomes the  Exchange  plant,  the  more extensive the system of junction lines (&apos;i.e., lines connecting the different Exchangeswith each other) and the more elaborate the operating arrangements.     For example, the cost of  an exchange for                                                  s.                     200 subscribers is about   8   0 per  line.                    1,000              ,,     .13  2  ,,                    3,000      ,,             14   6  ,,  ,,                   10,000      ,,.      ,,     17   0  ,,  ,,   ..       .     London, with about  150,000 subscribers,  requires  150,000  miles of junctioncircuits.(i.e.y exclusive of subscribers&apos; lines), while in  Manchester with 20,000 sub-scribers 8,000 miles suffice.                                -                .     An operator at a self-contained Exchange  could handle the calls from 147 lineswith average traffic;  in a large multi-Exchange area, assuming the same number ofcalls but a  high proportion  of junction traffic, one operator would  be required  forevery 72 lines.     The. experience  of the  National  Telephone  Company  in this  country and of telephone Administrations abroad point  to the  same conclusion.   In  1903 with278,000 telephones the average working cost per telephone of the National  TelephoneCompany was  31. 14s. 8d.  In 1911 with 561,000 telephones it was 3Z. 14s. 11c?.  Itis the almost universal practice of Telephone Administrations to charge higher ratesin big towns, where development is most intense, than in small towns or rural areas.The same point is emphasised by the Merchants&apos; Association of  New York, a bodywdiich cannot be accused of bias in favour of the Telephone Administration, in a reporton the New York  system,  which states :  &quot; The expenses  of  the  telephone system&quot;  increase,  not only  absolutely but also  relatively in proportion  to the  increasing&quot;  extension, inasmuch as, especially in the larger  towns,  the increase in the number&quot;  of  subscribers augments the expense of each single subscriber, on account of the&quot;  installations of the  Exchanges becoming even more complicated.&quot;    &apos; The development of the service is  admittedly desirable,  and brings advantages to.each individual subscriber by increasing the  number of  persons with whom he  cancommunicate.  But if the charges are fixed below cost price in the hope of the unitcost being reduced concurrently with the growth of the system, the result can, only bea deficit falling on the taxpayer, which will increase and not  diminish as expansion is realised.  Other.factors  must be  looked to  for a reduction of charges, viz., a fall inthe general level of  prices, aided by technical  progress  and improved processes ofmanufacture.                                 -            .

 .,  5. Much of the criticism of the new rates  is based upon and illustrated by thepercentage  increase in the payments of very large  users.   The fact that the largeuser represents a  very small proportion  of  the toral number of subscribers  in  theIJnited Kingdom is ignored.  Statements are made  of the percentage increase on anannual use  of  6,000 and  10,000 calls, as if they were typical examples  of the effectof. the new charges, although not more than 4 per  cent, of telephone  subscribersreach 6,000 calls and  1 per cent, reach .10,000 per annum.   Nearly one-third  of  thesubscribers in  the  United Kingdom use less calls than under the  present system areincluded  in the minimum subscription, and more than half of  the subscribers makeless than 1,000 calls per annum.     6. The incidence of the new charges is shown  in the following table.  Londonsubscribers have been grouped according  to their calling rate, and the  table shows the present and proposed charges  at  the mean of each  group,  together with thepercentage of  the total  number of London subscribers falling within  each group.For purposes  of  comparison, the rate which it  is proposed to  charge in New Yorkhave been added : Calls per Annum.250 or less250 to  500 5001,0002,0003,0004,0005,0001,000  -2,000  -3,000  -4,000  -5,000  -6,000  -Over 6,000Charge at the Mean of each       Group.Present.    $.  d.  6 10  0  6 11  3  8 2 11 5 15 8 19 11*20 0  0*20 0  06048Proposed,x  s.  d. 9  5  810 16  1113  317 1723 1929 1835 16  1041 15  79641PercentageIncrease of Charge. 43 65 62 59 55 53 79109Percentage ofSubscribers in each Group.18IS2119 8 6 2 2 6Proposed Charge in New York.   s. d.11   2  0111119302257o08539 12  247 18  656 &apos; 2  10Flat rate.

The proportionate increase is  greater for the large than&apos;for the small userbecause of the abolition of the Flat Rate, and in the Provinces of  the Measured Rate,which provides an exceptionally low charge (about a half-penny) per call at the higherpoints of the scale, and it  is round the abolition of  these rates  that most of theopposition to the new tariff is centred. &quot;    It is  claimed that &quot; on ordinary commercial principles &quot; a reduction should  beallowed to the large user.  In many commercial undertakings the unit cost is reduced&apos;by  manufacturing  or  selling  a  large  quantity  and it is, therefore, reasonable and
profitable to quote lower  terms  for a large  than for  a  small order.  But in the telephone  Service  this  condition does  not  apply.   Apart  from  the  subscribersinstrument and  the line connecting him with -the Exchange,  for which a separaterental  is charged, the cost of providing the service depends, not on the number of lines but on the number of calls, which determines the extent of the plant and thenumber  of operators required.  The  cost of handling 10,000 calls is the  same,whether they are made on one line or on fifty  lines.  In the  case of the large user,there is a small saving in the recording and collection of larger sums in  one account,hut  this  is more  than  counterbalanced by the rebate of 5  per cent,  which  it isproposed to allow on calls in excess of 2,000.     8. The principle on which the new tariff  is based  is  to charge each subscriberas nearly as  possible the cost of providing the service which he  requires.  If tholarge user is to be relieved of his share  of the cost, the small user must be overchargedto make  up  the difference.  It has  been  suggested  that, the Flat Rate  should beretained  but  increased.   At present  there are about 120,000 Flat Rate  Subscribers,who, in the aggregate, pay about l,20O,O0OL per annum less than the  cost of providingtheir service.  If  the Flat  Rate were increased from  2[)l. to 40L in  London, andfrom 121. to 25L in the Provinces (i.e.,  practically doubled), about 55,000 subscribers,or 10 per cent, of the total number would still  find it cheaper than the Message Rate.They would  then be undercharged by about 80O,O0OL which would  have to  be made good by overcharging the  remaining  500,000 subscribers li.  15s. each.   If  the flat rate were further raised to 50L in London and 301. in the Provinces, it would benefit25,000 subscribers, and the remaining 525,000 would have to pay an  extra 11. perannum.     9. Apart from its injustice as  between the  small  and the large user, the flat rate is  financially  unsound, because the cost  of the service  grows steadily  with increased use while  under the Flat  Rate system, the  Revenue remains  stationary.There  is no more justification for giving  a Flat Rate  in the Telephone  Service  than there would be for  giving unlimited, use  for  a fixed payment,  in the Postal orTelegraph  Service.  It is an obstacle  to an efficient service because  it encourages theoverloading of lines and increases the number of &quot; engaged  calls,&quot; and it  restrictsdevelopment because it  involves overcharging the small user, upon whom the futureexpansion of the service principally depends.     10.  The  Flat Rate system is  a relic of  the  early days of  Telephony, when thesubscribers were few and the number of calls insignificant.  As the  system developed the defects of the  Flat Rate became more and more apparent.  It has been abolishedin New York and Chicago.  In Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore it is restricted to private  residences and prohibited in  commercial premises.  In  Switzerland It isnot admitted.  The French Government have decided to  abolish it in Paris and thelarge towns  of France, and it is understood the German  Government propose to dqthe same.  In the United Kingdom it  has been restricted  in the Provinces to privateresidences since 1907.   The  following extracts from reports of various Committeesspeak  for themselves.  ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE NATIONAL TELEPHONE, COMPANY, LONDON, 1908..     &quot; The development of  the telephone had demonstrated the absolute unsoundnessof what was known  as  the Flat Rate an annual charge for as  many calls as thesubscriber chose to send.&quot;                  MERCHANTS&apos; ASSOCIATION, NEW YORK  CITY,  1905.     &quot; A system which exacts an average uniform  charge  for widely varying degrees of service is  obviously inequitable to  the public.  The  Flat  Rate is also  harmful tothe public in another way.   Such a rate, comprehending all classes of business usersand based upon the average of wide extremes,  of necessity compels  small users to payable relatively higher rate than they would  pay under a graded rate based  upon the costof the service used by them, and is therefore highly burdensome to  such users, andpresents a formidable obstacle to the development of the telephone system.&apos;&apos;.                       FEDERAL COUNCIL, SWITZERLAND, 1909.      &apos;  ,;     &quot;In a revision of  subscribers  rates the  principle should be employed that thesubscriber&apos;s payments  ought to be, as far as possible, in proportion  to  the  use hemakes of the telephone, even in regard to the fixed annual rate.&quot;
                       FRANCE, REPORT OF BUDGET OF 1909.     &quot; The Flat Rate system, which  is in effect in the larger cities of France, precludesa  good service whatever the excellence of the personnel and  the equipment;  this isto-day the unanimous opinion of&apos; engineers and telephone managers in  every country,and it is an opinion  definitely and scientifically established,  because  it is based on very wide telephone experience.&quot; STATEMENT BY MR. F.  H. BETIIELL, VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK TELEPHONE                              COMPANY  IN  1913.     &quot; Flat rates simply make it impossible to properly develop the telephone service.   .  .  .   The  rate  should increase  as  the use increases.  Every business house should have its own  line, and every business  house should pay for the number ofmessages  it sends  over that line.  The Flat Rate  business in Baltimore costs  the telephone company between $35,000 and  140,000 a year more than the revenue fromthat source, and the burden of this loss is  now distributed among the subscribers wdiopay message rates.  The real conflict of interest in this case, therefore, is not betweenthe telephone company and the  business public, but  between  the  relatively small number of subscribers  who have unlimited  business service and the much  larger number whose  service is  measured.   ...   It seems proper  at this time to call attention to the fact that whenever  and wherever the matter has been  carefully andintelligently considered, the Flat Rate has been  condemned.    11. It is said  that the abolition  of  the Flat  Rate will  involve  heavy expen-diture     (1) On the Post Office in recording calls and compiling and rendering accounts.    (2) On the  subscriber  in checking of the Post Office  record of  calls, which is           alleged to  be frequently  inaccurate.                           : .    As regards (1), the  total cost of recording  the  calls and rendering the  accounts of  Flat Rate subscribers is estimated at 34,OO0Z. per annum, or about 5s.&apos; Qd. per head,while the  additional revenue estimated to be obtained under the new tariff from  thesame subscribers is 1,200,OOOL                                                 .    As regards (2), more than 80 per cent, of the subscribers in the United kingdom are already charged according to the number of their caJls.  The system of meteringin  this country is the  same as that in operation in New York and many other impor-tant cities.  In 1908  a Committee of  the London  Chamber of Commerce, at  the invitation  of the Post  Office, investigated  the system of recording calls and  reportedthat &quot;as far as, they are able to judge, the means  now adopted at the  Exchange  for&quot; checking subscribers&apos; calls are mechanically efficient,  and  from statistics submitted&quot; it appeared that  the percentage  of errors, which was very small, was in favour of&quot; the public and  slightly against  the Post  Office.  .  .   .&apos;  The  Committee also&quot; thoroughly investigated the method of book-keeping and  satisfied themselves that&quot;every possible check was  made to ensure accuracy in the keeping of subscribers&apos;&quot; accounts.&quot;             &apos;    Experience  has  shown that in  practice  the  number  of disputed accounts is extremely small.                                TRUNK  CHARGES.    12. Under the new tariff the  local  fee (l^d.)  will cover communication with anyExchange within a 5 mile radius of  the originating  Exchange.  Beyond this distancetrunk  fees will be charged on a scale graduated according to distance, based uponthe ascertained cost of providing the service.    Under the  existing system the  country is divided into  arbitrary &quot; trunk areas,&quot;some 550  in number.,  Calls between Exchanges  situated in different trunk areas  are changed as trunk calls, while calls between Exchanges more  than 2 miles apart withinthe same  area are  charged as &quot;junction calls.&quot;   In many cases a trunk fee of id., inaddition to the local fee, is  charged for a distance  of 3 or 4 miles, while in others ajunction fee of 2d., in addition to the local fee,  covers a call over 15 or 20 miles.  Infuture the fees, whether trunk or junction, for distances under. 5  miles will heabolished, and the charges for calls over greater distances will be fixed on a uniformscale.  Owing  to  the steps in the new  scale  differing, from those  in the. old,-the
February 1921. percentage increase will vary at different points, but on an  average the new charges Avill represent an addition of 51 per cent, to the current rates.     13. London requires special provision  owing to the large number of Exchanges situated in  the central area.  It is  proposed, therefore,  that  for  the.purpose of measuring charges a central area of a 5-mile radius should  be regarded as a point. The effect  will  be  that-     (a) Subscribers connected with any Exchange in central  London will be able to           communicate with any Exchange within a 10-mile radius of the centre for           the local fee (l\d.);     (??)  Subscribers in outer London will be able to communicate with, any Exchange           in the  central  area or with any Exchange within 5  miles of their  own           Exchange for the local fee;     (c) For  calls  between Exchanges  in, say, North London and  South London, the           central area will be ignored and the distance will be measured  from the           originating Exchange to the nearest  point on the boundary of  the central           area and from the other boundary to  the receiving Exchange.     The same provisions, with the substitution  of 2 miles for 5 miles, will apply to Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, and Manchester.     14.  The new tariff was framed on the basis  of the costs prevailing in May 1920. Since then there has been a fall in the price of materials, which has, however, been more than  counterbalanced by an increase  in the war bonus.  It appears improbable that the cost of living  will fall sufficiently during .1921-22 to affect materially the estimates of  expenditure framed  in 1920.   But  if and when  there is a  prospect of a material surplus on the Telephone Service, it is recognised  that the telephone user is entitled to the benefit of  it by a reduction in the tariff,  either in the  form of a percentage deduction from all  accounts or otherwise, and provision -to this effect will be made in the new agreements.
