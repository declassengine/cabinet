2 513 MfCAB IN. S T31.1.1921.    ^LL^^  NAVAL  POLICY  AND  SHIPBUILDING.         ieiORANDUM BY THg FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.         Fifteen months ago it was represented to the Cabinetby the admiralty,that, in the absence of any shipbuilding programme,there would be a dispersal of the existing facilities for theconstruction of warships and their equipment in this country unlessSpecial provision was made for their retention (AdirdraltyMemorandum of 24th October, 1919 on Naval policy and expenditure).                         V         In two Memoranda&apos; early in December last the Board ofAdmiralty brought to the notice of the Cabinet the continuous and serious shrinkage that is actually taking place in the facilitiesfor the building of large warships in this&quot;country.         The shrinkage is due to the scrapping of special plant and the dispersal of skilled workmen.    Every month reveals new and grave instances of reduced capacity arising from these causes.         It will be remeiibered that tho Admiralty had proposed to arrest this process of shrinkage by paying subsidies to the armament firms to keep their plant and special staff available, and an itemestablishing the policy of suoh subsidies was includedin the Estimates for 1920-21.     A Contoittee presidedFinancial Secretary to the Treasury took evidence fromfirms in order to ascertain the amount of subsidy that required, but no further action has followed, as it was orallyagreed between the Admiralty and the Treasury that subsidies wouldnot be wanted if shipbuilding orders were to be placed.and TJassedover by thethe principalwould be         The Board of Admiralty have now to inform the Cabinet thatthe shrinkage in the available capacity for production of armourplate has reached a point at which it seriously affects our ability to carry out an adequateprogrammeof,warship construction.         The situation has now been aggravated by the acceptance by messrs.Vickers of the large order for the Japanese Navy, informationas to which was furnished to the Cabinet earl:/ in December.     Theincreased quantity of amour required for ships of the new designsprepared by the Admiralty has also to be taken into account.         Hitherto the armour-producing plant in this country has been sufficient to deal simultaneously with the armour for four largeships - the full number for which building slips are available withoitcostly adaptation.     The armour-pro due being plant now remainingavailable can only deal with the armour for three large up-to-dateships.         The effect of this shrinkage, and of the general disorganisetion and dispersal of other faoilities,  is that it is now no longer possible in the opinion of the Admiralty, to reckon on the new shipswhose construction was recommended in Admiralty Memorandum of the22nd November last being completed in  3   years from the date of approval of the policy.    If approval is given by the end of Maroh,the four shins might be laid down by the end of the year and 3 of theithem might be completed by December 1924, i.e. in 5f years from thedate of &quot;^approval.&quot;   But the fourth ship would suffer additionaldelay, as&quot;her armour could not be taken in hand until that for oneof the other ships has been got out of the way.        Her completion,will, therefore,&quot;be delayed intil June, 1925, i.e. over 4 years fromthe date of approval.If approval
 If approval  were  to be  postponed until  the autumn, none of the ships  could be completed until the  middle of  1925, and one could  not  be  completed until the end of  1925, even if no further shrinkage of war shipbuilding oapaoity were to take place.    No  other  ships could be completed until the middle  of  1926 or iater.      It will  be  seen from the forgoing THAT -   (a)   One of  the main  advantagea THAT we have always possessed  over other Naval powers,  vizt., our ability to  build quickly, is rapidly slipping away from us:   (b)   Any further postponement of the decision nn the building programme,- e,g, until after the Imperial Con- reference,- will be tantamount to an acceptance of the position that  in  1925 THE United States will have at least three  times as many up-to-date capital ships, and Japan at least twice as many, as Great Britain, anl a  comparatively small effort on their part would enable them to retain the lead.      The Cabinet will recall that  repeated representationshave been made by the First Lord and the First Sea Lord that delay in  coming to a decision  whether the policy recommended by the Admiralty shall  be accepted would materially affect the practicability of carrying it out.      The financial effect of the delay which has now become inevitable owing to the causes mentioned in thisMemorandum will be that it will not be possible to spendmore than approximately 4 millions  in 1921-22 on thonew  ships included in the proposed  programme.   This is less by about 5g- millions than the  sum previouslyestimated to  be spent in 19&apos;21-22.                        (Intd.)   W.H.L.                             31st January, 1921.

It has already been agreed by the Cabinet thatthe Naval Shipbuilding enquiry entrusted to the Committee ofImperial Defence shall be regarded as a matter of urgency.This phrase, however.  is capable ot different interpretationsrand the Admiralty dee ire to point but how necessary It Isthat a decision should le arrived at in time for effect tobe given to it In 1921..Eg.          In the first place, the following limiting facts .must be stated     (a)  It takes from 15 to 18 months to advance a Capital          ship to the  launching sta^e, and 3 years to complete          her.     (b)  There are only 6 berths in this country which could          be used for  the construction cf modern capital ships,          and of these only 4 can be conveniently usedo  To          adapt other  berths than these 6 would involve great          expense and  delay,.     (c)  There is onl$ sufficient sfeilled shipbuilding labour,          and only sufficient special armour, heavy gun, gun          mounting and shell plant, to deal with 4 such ships          a year 4   To expand these facilities would involve          ftreat expense and delay,.          At the present moment, therefore, it must beaccepted that 6 capital ships represent the maximum that canbe laid down in one year; and 4 capital ships represent themaximum that can be laid down &quot;under economical conditionsof buildinr?4*          It has already been pointed out in the memorandum to the Cabinet that the position In 1925, assuming that welay down 4 capital ships both in 1921-22 and in 1920-23,will be as follows                  Great Britain.   tjnitod States.     Japan,   Class A.  90,          9&quot;            1                   8 k   Class B.  .&apos;. *         13                 11            4   Class C.  . ..          4                  4            4                       28                 27            16 x               K 8 others to be completed by 1928,          If a decision Is so delayed.that we are unable to lay down 4 capital ships in 1921-22., it must be accepted thatour facilities will not allow us to&apos;lay down more than 4 in1922-23t quite apart from the obvious political objections toa greater programme    The position in 1925 would then be :-
         Great BrItaIn.      United States.       Japan.Class A. ...    5                  12               8KClass B. ...   13                  11               4Class C. ...    4                   4               4              ******                 ******             ********               22                  27              16  x            x  8 others to be completed by 1928.          Several of the new U*S. Ships will be completed in1923-24^ and possibly some of the Japanese, and it would be easy for either or both nations, having established this lead,to match any subsequent shipbuilding by us and thus torelegate Great Britain permanently to Third Naval Power.          Moreover, it cannot even bo treated as certain thatif the commencement of building is deferred until 192f3-v34Jfacilities for laying down 4 capital ships in a year will stdMremain available in this country, unless exceptional steps are taken to ensure this..   The Admiralty entertain on thispoint grave apprehensions, which are based on the following considerations J-     (1)  Special plant and machinery, different from those         . used for merchant ships/ are required for warship          construction and are already being scrapped te&apos;          ehable peace work te be undertaken*     (2)  Specially skilled labour,. accustomed to special          warship work, is being dispersed, and the longer          warship construction is put off, the more difficult          it will be to find suitable skilled labour.     (3)  The heavy gun, armour and gun mounting Firms are          already asking for subsidies to keep their armament          plant in existence, I*e.  500,000 per annum,          6 per cent, of its value.   If this plant Is          scrapped from lack of use and it is again required          in 1, 2, or 3 years time, it will require an          expenditure of ten- times its original cost, i.e.           100,000,000.          In short, in delaying new capital ship constructionuntil 1921-22, we have held our hand up to the last possible moment, and the loss of the year 1921-22 would be nothing lessthan disastrous to our chance of retaining our naval equality with the strongest ^avel Power.          The suggestion has been made that the result ofhesitation on our part might -be - to encourage the , United states to modify their 1916 programme.          It is important, therefore, to point out that ofthe 12 united States ships classed above as &quot;A&quot;     5 Battleships are well advanced and due for completion       in 1923-24.     1 Battleship and 4 Battle Cruisers are-less advanced       but due for completion in 1921-25.                                                                8     2 Battle Cruisers are about to be laid down:  material     ^       is being collected;  and they also are due for          . I       completion in 1924-25.
          It Is inconceivable that the UnHed States wouldscrap the 5 Battleships which are well on the way to completion,and must Improbable that they would take off the siips the sixth Battleship and the 4 Battle Cruisers actually laid do^n.          Any change of policy on their part would be likely,therefore, only to affect the 2 Battle Cruisers not yet laiddown.          But assuming for the sake of argument that it ex-tended to the whole of their Battle Cruisers, and that they notonly abandoned the 2 not laid down, but removed the other 4from the slips, such action on their pRrt ,fvould hot obviate thenecessity for our laying down 4 capital ships thJLs year.  Bydoial&amp;  so we should barely maintain cur supremacy, as, is evidentfrom ihe following figures, which wpuld then represent theposition in 1925 J..               Great Britain.   United States.    Japan.               .ii nm in.

It might, in fact,pay the United States to take this step, relying on the effectbeing to make it politically impossible for Great britain to lay down any capital ships at all&quot;.
