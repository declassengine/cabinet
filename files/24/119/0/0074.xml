MEMORANDUM  ON  THB  QUESTION OB1 THIS AUGMENTATION           OF SKILLED  LABOUR  IN  THS BUILDING THAD3 THROUGH           THE ABSORPTION OF  UMPLOXSD S2-SBHVICB MM.(Discussed at  Conference  with Building Employers  on Friday, February 11th,  1921.)Tho National federation of Building Trades Bmployers  of                       Great Britain and Ireland;                               48 Bedford Square,                                   London, W.C.1.                                   10th February,  1921.     The toployers Representatives whioh constituted theDeputation received by the Prime Minister on the 9/8/21 feelthat a case could be made for a proposal on the following lines     Subject to consultation with the other Industries who wouldbe affected we are prepared to recommend the provision of a schemefor Supplementary Unemployment Benefit to the amount of fifteenshillings per week paid for by equal contributions from Employersand Operatives and to be made obligatory by the; Government on allBuilding Trade Employers, subject to other provisions of national insurance Scheme.     That this amount be subject to revision periodically as maybe agreed so that as wages fall with the cost of living the likeproportion of benefit to wages be maintained while the burden onthe contributants will be correspondingly eased.     That the Government make a Scheme of that kind obligatory onour Industry.     That the workmen accept Bx-Service men to the number of 50,000to be allocated to the trades which most urgently need reinforcement     That Bmployers and Workmen co-operate in training these men.     The conditions of employment and rates payable to the traineesduring training to be agreed by representatives of the Ex-Servicemen, the Bmployers, the Trade Unions and a Committee approved bythe Government (who no doubt will take account of the discussions    .of the Resettlement CCmmittee of the Industrial Council relatingto this class of trainee).     The principle of payment should be that the rate paid by theBuilding Employer together with the subsidy granted to the traineeby Government should together be a certain percentage of thestandard rate for each trade; provided always that any trainee may at any time apply for a certificate of efficiency which if.grantedwould entitle him to the full rates of the trade.                                                          That13 DOCOMSHT  IS  THB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJ3STYT3 GOVERNMENT).
     That an Employer wishing to engage any of his Operatives upona system of bonus on output, shall te at liberty to do so where practicable and in agreement with the Operative or Operativesconcerned, providing always that the rates of wages paid during thearrangement shall not be less than 10$ above the prevailing hourlyrate.     That the Government give its whole hearted support to theScheme on line to be agreed.     That the Employers Committee be authorised to first confer with their Executive Councils and with the National confederation of Employers1 Organisations and if those bodies approve, confer withthe Worlraen^ Executive Council and report to the Government andthat upon their report a final decision be made.     In drawing this Scheme our object has been to make a strong case along the following lines(a)  The Soheme permanently removes the fear of unemployment to     such an extent that there is no longer any force in the argument   .      that the workmen must seek to restrain output for     fear of unemployment and that therefore they should view the     scheme without prejudice.(b)  That it will involve an amount of joint control by them and   ,  us over entry into the Industry whioh will insure that no harm     will accrue to them in the future through a too great INFLUX     of men.(c)  That the provision against unemployment insures that the     admission of 50,000 men will not prejudice those already in the     Trade.(d)  That the addition of 50,000 will not raise the total number     of men in the Industry to the Pre-War level and that even     though a Largo number of men, now out of the Industry, be     attracted lack tc it, by the Scheme, It would not raise the     total number to the number which v/ere in it at the last census     but  one when there were over 1,000,000 men returned as in our     Industry.(e)  That with the many years OF prosperit?/, now overdue to the     Industry, and sure to come after a little time there is     nothing to fear from the proposed Increase.(f)
  (f)  That the addition to the Industry of men under this  Scheme      will tend to increase employment rather  than the reverse      because the inadequate supply of labour  in oertain sections      of the Trade and the existing small output with the  consequent      high cost of the product is strangling the demand  that  would      otherwise exist.l/g)  That adhesion to the soheme will remove  a grave stigma  fromV;    us all.  fh)  That both Employers and Workmen will have strong financial      induoemehts to insure their seeing that  the scheme is worked      fairly all round and not abused in any way and that  such a      control.is excroised that the Industry shall bo properly      manned but not overorowde&amp;*      In conferring with tho Confederation wo  Could remove anyapprehensions they may entertain by pointing out that the  bonus-on-Sutput&apos; consideration is good valuo for&apos;the Unemployment  concessionwhether for our Industry or for others and that by aoting  aspioneers in a settlement of this importance wo are.fighting the battle cf all of them and ought to have their  hearty riupport. &apos;      To our own people a similar argument would equally appeal andthey would feel timt the soheme was worth making sacrifices toobtain it.      Taken  long with the proposed National Working Rule  Agreementnow about to be submitted for ratification tho two schemes would oachcomplement the other and provide a real and beneficial resettlement of our Industry.      In conclusion it is felt that the movement in all  industries toprovide against unemployment is so strong that it cannot be. longresisted but that unless that reform is accompanied by a reform onthe question of output the movement will result in harm  to theoutput of this Industry and of the other Industries.      As regards the Government the soheme should also appeal  andwe think they may be reassured upon the point  mentioned  by thePremier, viz. the feasibility of confining the matter, especially if it comes to a fight, to our Industry.      On&apos;the question raised by Dr. Maonamara&apos;  that a prepasal toenforce bonus on output wouia unite the whole  trade union  movement,against us and the Government, we would reply  that, while  there naaybe something in that argument if the question  cf output  only  was put forward and the fear of ^employment not at the same time.retared, the fact of the two things being coupled indissolubletogether by the soheme puts a very different complexion  on the.matters, when tho Engineering Trade feught the question  af benuB&quot;*On-*ou^sut to a finish in pfs-war Aays the ether industries  did notunrbe against the Engineering Traao* beyond, lending their usualfinancial aid to man on strike;  many large industries already are .paid by results and to put a fair give and take soheme before t&amp;eCountry would secure so large a measure ef ?ublie support  that.there-should be little danger of the other industries Veoominginvolved.
