(Received at Foreign Office, January 4,1921.)(Secret.)                              Questions 1 and 2.1.  WHAT is the policy of  the German Government with regard to currency-note    issues ?   What measures do they contemplate to stop  the continued increase of    paper  money, which  threatens  the whole  fabric  of German finance,  and    continually alters the standard of value in Germany ?2.  What is the policy of the German Government with regard to the floating debt?                                   Answers.   . The total expenditure of Germany at the present time is far in excess of theactual revenue.  In so far as this expenditure is not covered by the actual revenue,the German Government is  compelled to create a floating debt.  This floating debtis brought about by the issue of Treasury notes (Treasury bills) which are discountedat the Reichsbank, and on redemption are credited to the German Government at the reichsbank  in the circulation account (&quot; Girokonto &quot;).  The Government disposesof these credits at need by withdrawal or transfer.    The Reichsbank sells the Treasury notes whenever possible to banks and privatecustomers.   To this extent existing resources are utilised and  issues of new notesavoided.   Nevertheless a considerable and ever-increasing  amount of such treasury bills at present 45-50 milliard marks remains in  the hands of the  Reichsbank.-    With the floating debt continually increasing, and with little prospect of success in the negotiation of voluntary  loans in Germany until financial  and economicconditions have become stabilised, it is necessary to keep on renewing Treasury notespresented at the  Reichsbank and to make fresh issues. There is no compulsory with-drawal of the paper-money issues arising out of the disposal of  those circulatingGovernment credits as the Treasury notes at the Reichsbank are not redeemed in cash.On the contrary, the  paper-money issues remain for the  most part  and for a long period in circulation,  increase the money  in  circulation  in the country and causeinflation.    The situation is aggravated by the fact that in consequence of the  heavy taxation,part of the population of Germany, in order to evade the taxes, secretly hoards largeamounts estimated to be from 10-12 milliards of paper money so that it is with-drawn from circulation and withheld from return to the Reichsbank.    The final abolition of this system appears possible only if the expenditure of theGovernment is completely and regularly covered by  actual receipts.  In view of the increasing inflow from taxation which will result from the reorganisation of the taxadministration, it  is hoped to exercise a  certain check on the increase in papercurrency so  that the  increase in  paper-money, up to the present  approximately2J milliard marks  a month, will shortly be reduced to a sum considerably below this.In order to  improve  matters still further, the Government has introduced a Bill inthe Reichstag, by which every person liable to the capital levy tax will be compelledto pay to the  Government,  in two fixed instalments, in February and August 1921,10 per cent, of  his  fortune, but not less than  one-third of his capital levy  tax.According to the existing law it was permissible to p(ay the whole capital levy taxin^ the form of annual instalments over thirty or fifty years.    The policy of the German Government in regard to  the floating debt and theissue of notes is to restrict the increase by the strictest economy in expenditure, and total up to the hilt.  While the political and economic conditions do not permit of the transformation of the floating debt into sound loans, the Treasury notes will be with-drawn from the public to as large an amount as possible in  order to diminish the  noteissue.[5277 d-41 oB
Have German taxes on real property been raised  in proportion to the depreciated     value of money ?                                   Answer.     A complete adjustment of the taxable value of real property to the depreciatedvalue of money is not possible.  Land remains generally a long time in the possessionof the owner.  The rise in value which is taking place in the land  market cannot betaken advantage of by the owners.  Moreover, with every fluctuation of the value ofmoney the fixing  of  the value of  real property  must again be undertaken,  which istechnically inconceivable.     In the case of houses,  complete assimilation is not  possible because their valueowing to provisions of the rent  regulations, whereby the rent must not be more than3 o.p. per cent, higher than in peace time, is artificially depressed on social grounds.Nevertheless, the  new  tax  legislation is seeking to take into  account the alteredconditions in the value of landed property.     Under the capital tax levy  the value of real property must  be  so stated that thecapital value  of  the average net proceeds for the years  1914-1919  becomes  thestandard.  As the revenue, especially of agricultural  land, has  risen very  muchduring this period, the value of the land will be assessed very  much higher than beforethe war,  although the producing capacity of the land has very much decreased, thus the actual value has fallen.     The   actual   land  and  property taxes  have  been  left to the provinces andGemeinden.  These  raise  the taxes  partly according to the value of the receipts,partly according  to the common value (sale value). Especially with municipal realestate is  the common value generally the  basis of  assessment.   Prussia has laid  aBill before the State Assembly  whereby the common value is to be the basis of land and property taxes for the whole State.  Thus the high rate of ten in the thousand,in some cases  five in the thousand, is proposed.  Thereby powers are  given for the assessment of  property in Prussia for the period  1917-1919.  Under  this propertytax real estate is assessed very much higher than in peace time. Prussia alone intends to obtain, including the additions, 2,000 million marks  from this  recently proposedtax.  What this means is best seen by the fact  that in 1913 the total proceeds fromland and property taxes for the whole of Germany, as it was then, amounted to370 million marks.     Moreover, provinces and Gemeinden since they are now  restricted, generallyspeaking, to taxation on assessed value of profits on real estate, and to taxation oftrade are already as a consequence of financial needs compelled  to tax real  estatevery much higher than in peace time.     It is pointed out finally, that in the case of property sales exclusively the  salevalue becomes the basis of the taxation assessment, first under the land purchase tax, which amounts to 4 per cent, (in some cases 6 per cent) of the sale value, thenunder the increment value tax, so that the increase in value of property realised onsale- serves to  benefit the States and Gemeinden, and this increase in value becomeshigher as the  sale price becomes higher as a result of the falling  purchasing  powerof money.                                   Question 4.(Translation.)What are the  facts to be communicated with regard to the flight of capital abroad?                                    Answer.     There are no definite figures nor any estimates based on satisfactory data of theamount of the sums which have passed out of the country.   All the estimates in thisconnection are based on suppositions.     It is not  possible to give a  detailed statement of the measures  taken by Germanyto  arrest the flight of capital  abroad  and the non-payment  of  taxes; this  wouldrequire an entire memorandum.  The law in question is that of the 26th June, 1918,which seeks to combat the non-payment of taxes, as well as several subsequent lawson the non-payment of taxes and the flight of capital which  are in force here.  Thereare also  a  series of provisions dealing with the supervision  of  the  operations  in capital sums with foreign  countries.     If this appears desirable, Berlin will draft a  memorandum.   You are requestedto state to what questions in particular a reply is desired/

The German  laws on taxation do not  allow figures to be  given  concerning the taxes actually to be paid by private persons or definite companies.   For this reason wemust confine ourselves to examples.    An idea can be arrived at of the taxation on large fortunes in  accordance with thenew legislation on taxes from the following examples :                                                                          M.

Question 6.What effect has the  fall in valuta had on German export trade?  Does it not give    either permanently  or  temporarily a  great  advantage  to Germany  over    competitors, since the cost of labour and raw  materials in Germany  does not    appear to have risen proportionately  with the fall in valuta?                                    Answer.    The fall of valuta in  a.country is in itself an  inducement to export from thatcountry.  This inducement usually ceases if the valuta of the exporting country has reached  a certain stability, and, as is generally  the  case sooner or later, if theinternal wages and prices exceed those abroad.   In countries where export industries are dependent upon  large imports, the adjustment between home and  foreign price is proportionately rapid, because the failing valuta not only reduces exports, but at
the same  time correspondingly  handicaps and  raises the price  of imports and thereby drives up the internal level of prices and wages.    If a general average is taken, it is clear that prices and wages in Germany havenot by a long way reached the low level of the German valuta; this applies especially to wages,  which are  at present only from  seven to thirteen times  the wages  underpre-war conditions.    On the other  hand,  of  course, a large  number  of important  raw materialsnecessary  for  export trade,  especially ore,  iron, wool,  cotton, leather  and  theirmanufactured products, have increased to  prices which amount to about twenty tothirty times the pre-war values,  and  which are already much  depreciated by theexport premiums given in connection with the falling  valuta.   Nevertheless, on thewhole, the normal effects on  imports of a depreciation  of the valuta  appeared inGermany at the same time as the catastrophic fluctuation of the  mark.  Meanwhile,for various reasons the increase in German exports has  not by a long way reached thelevel which might have been expected in view of the great depreciation of the valuta.One must  not be deceived by mere export statistics.  In the memorandum submittedby  Germany to  the  International  Financial  Conference  at  Brussels in reply to question No. 6, the value of the German exports is shown  on page 21 as follows:                                                              Million Marks.        January 1919    ...      ...       ...      ...       ...      161February 1919March 1919April 1919May 1919Juiie 1919July 1919August 1919September 1919October 1919November 1919December 1919January  1920February 1920March 1920April 1920May 1920  195  292  270 .251  406  570  735  7901,0891,2844,0143,2194,2624,2165,3446,647    The figure for June 1920, however, has fallen to 5,899 million marks.    It is to be observed from these figures:     1. Until  the middle of last year the German export figures are insignificant asa result of the blockade and the so-called &quot; Gap in the West.&quot;  If since that time there  has  been an increase, it is due  to a considerable extent to the disappearance of both factors.   In this  connection, it may be admitted that the influence of theexport premium is apparent, especially from the increase of the figures for April toJune, 1920.    2. The export statistics appear higher because they include deliveries of goods to the Entente under the Peace Treaty.   Since about October 1919 these deliverieshave been for largely increasing amounts; according to what has been ascertainedup to now, by the  end of October 1920 about  20 milliards of marks have beenaccounted for, which were distributed unequally over each month in the first monthsnaturally lowest, in  the last highest.    3. The German export statistics are in terms of the paper mark.  One can only make a comparison with  the exports of other countries  by reducing the  german exports to a gold basis.  If the present export statistics of Germany,  France and england were reckoned on the gold basis of the mark compared with the dollar ofthe United States,  the four countries in question would appear  somewhat  asfollows:-                                       -                            VALUE of Export Trade.  Germany January to June, 1920, considerably less than  France&apos; January to October, 1920, approximately  England-January to October, 1920  United States of America-January to September, 1920[5277 d-4]Million Marks.   2,000   5,400  17,400  25,500        C
    In face of the development as shown by these figures in the various countries,it cannot be accepted that Germany has obtained a &quot; great &quot; advantage over othercountries as a consequence of the depreciation of her valuta.  It must be recognisedon a comparison of the exports  for the year 1913 how severely the German exporttrade has suffered.    In 1913 the export of goods-reckoned in the gold mark-was :                                                              Milliard Marks.        Germany         ...      ...       ...      ...       ...     10,1        England          ...      ...       ...      ...       ...     10,7        United States of America  ...       ...      ...       ...     10,4        Prance           ...      ...       ...      ...       ...      5,6    The unfavourable development as shown above in the German export trade is,of course, closely bound up with the effects of the war.  In Germany the demands ofthe five-and-a-half years&apos; war have almost entirely consumed raw stuffs and materials;every private need had to give  way to the requirements of the war.   If the formernow seeks satisfaction which, in view of the continued shortage of goods and increasein prices,  can even to-day only be met to an altogether inadequate degree, naturally,less goods are available for purposes of  export.  Add to this that, especially as a consequence of insufficient food  during and since the war, the quantity and quality of the  output of the  German workman  has greatly  suffered,  and is  even nowconsiderably below the capacity of the  worker in neutral and Entente countries.  Thesame applies to means of production, machines, &amp;c, the utility of which is very muchlessened by the use  of  substitutes and by  reckless  wear and tear during the war,without its being possible up to the  present to undertake repairs or the necessaryreplacements on account of the enormous rise in price and shortage of good material.Moreover, the difficult  economic position of Germany resulting from the pressure of the Peace Treaty has influenced, and must influence, foreign trade in the directionof a reduction of exports and an increase in imports.   This has been explained indetail by  the statements submitted at earlier sessions by the German delegates and experts.     Further, it must not be overlooked that the German exporter, in spite of theexport premium given on account of the fall of the valuta, has to reckon with greatrisks of loss due to sudden exchange fluctuations, and such cases are frequent, becausethe foreign valuta in which later on he is paid for the goods has depreciated in  themeantime.  This risk is not always and not fully covered by  the ordinary safeguards which are at the disposal of the exporter (for  instance, time bargains for bills ofexchange (&quot; Devizentermingeschafts&apos;&apos;)).   When in February of this year the Germanvaluta  reached its lowest level  and the price of the American dollar had risen to 100 M. and more,  and when rapid  improvements took place  in  the valuta whichdepreciated the dollar to about 33 M. in May, the export trade  was, as a matterof fact, severely handicapped.   In particular, export industries working on foreignraw materials were confronted with  a loss similar to that  of the importers, whosestocks continually depreciated in value in view of the economic and market crise&amp;r     To sum up, it  can be  said that Germany has only benefited, and could only benefit, to a slight extent by the favourable effects which the fall of the valuta usually and naturally has upon the  exports of a country.                                  Question 7. Give an up-to-date table of exports and imports, stating quantities as well as mone-     tary values.    How do the total imports and exports  in Germany during the     current year compare with the figures for 1919, and for the average of the three     years before the war, in quantities and in marks ?                                    Answer.     The German delegation cannot at present give a complete answer to this question.     The available material has, however,  already been submitted, namely: -     1. Table showing imports for the year 1919.          (a.) Values.          (&amp;.) Quantities.
    2. Table showing exports for the year 1919.         (a.)  Values.         (&amp;.)  Quantities.    3. Table showing the imports (quantities) in the months January to July  1920.    4. Table showing exports from January to July 1920.         (a.)  Values.         (b.)  Quantities.    The German delegation, however, emphasises the fact that these figures are notto be regarded as final, but require revision in Berlin.    In view of the possible inaccuracy of the statement of import values, the german delegation invites attention to the evidence given verbally by the President of the reichsbank, Herr Havenstein, in the afternoon session of the Conference of the 16thDecember, 1920.   According to that,  the import  values must  be estimated failingany obligation to declare them at the time of import.    This estimate is only approximate, on account of the unsatisfactory conditions and fluctuation of prices  and of the valuta,  which do not permit comparison  withexport values.    The German delegation has, therefore, taken no account of thestatement of  values for  the year 1920.    The answer in detail to question 7 follows.                                  Question 8.Elow far does the German  Government control export prices ?                                    Answer.    The control of export prices in Germany is assigned to the export  trade offices.The export trade authorities are self-administrative bodies formed in the  Kreisenof producers and consumers interested.   They fix, in accordance with general  direc-tions  of  the Government,  the quantities  of goods to be exported.  The principle  in fixing the export prices is that the highest possible price on the world  market is tobe received.   Individual  export trade  offices are free in the choice  of policy forattaining this end and have, in fact, adopted various methods.    For instance, some export trade offices insist  on invoicing the current price  inthe currency of  the foreign country concerned, others demand  the conversion of thecurrent price in dollars into paper marks, others proceed on the peace-time price and make additions corresponding to the  rise in prices in  the various countries.  Ingeneral,  we might say that this purely practical question must be decided accordingto the merits of each individual case.    Government control is confined to ensuring that the highest possible prices are obtained, in order to prevent goods being sold abroad by individual merchants  undercost price, to the detriment of the general economic situation, and so to ensure thatdumping and similar operations are in all circumstances avoided.   Important aidsto control are the so-called work delivery certificates, that is to say, the merchantsare bound, immediately on purchase, to  inform  the producers  that the goods aredestined for  export and to issue  a certificate to that effect.    This step is necessary, firstly, in order to effect control of the quantities exported,as it  often happens that  particular centres of production have a quota of exportsallotted to them, and secondly, in order to make it possible to allocate to the producera part of the excess profit realised on export through the merchants.    At the time when,  owing to the low position of the mark and to gradual  conse-quences  of the costs of production (see question 6) the difference between prices athome and abroad was extraordinarily large, the Government introduced an exporttax, that is to say,  they demanded from the exporter through the export trade officesthe payment of a part of his profit to the State.  This tax was  justified first of all inthat the lowness of the prime costs was to be  attributed to the direct measures  of theGovernment, and even to the gold advances (for food stuffs).  In this way the Govern-ment tried to recover a part of this expenditure.   On the temporary rise in the markin the spring of 1920 the possibility of increasing the export tax wTas much slighter,and as the mark began to  fall again, the home prices had in many provinces approxi-mated so nearly to the prices abroad that to-day the export tax can only be raised onisolated groups.

What are the restrictions on exports now enforced in Germany ?  What is the object    of  these  restrictions?  What  is their  effect?  How  long  will  they  be    maintained ?                                   Answer.    In principle all goods in Germany  are subject to export prohibitions; only small groups being excepted by ordinance.  These ordinances are published from  time totime.   In addition, special agreements are made when circumstances warrant.    Export control does not extend merely to the fixing of price according to theconditions  prevailing in the world  market  (see question 8) but especially  in thedirection of securing the quantities necessary for the internal needs of Germany.Eor instance, in consequence of special  circumstances it might be more advantageousfor home producers of raw stuffs and.  semi-manufactured goods to dispose of their products abroad.   The German manufacturing industry would thus find itself in a disastrous position.  A shortage of raw material would bring about a stoppage oftrade and labour unrest and consequently enormous damage to the German power ofproduction.   The injury would be not  less serious for the Entente, as in practice afurther shutting clown of German factories must endanger, most seriously, the repara-tion deliveries.  Only if exports are limited by expert professional authorities toexcess over internal requirements does it remain possible to keep German productiongoing so far as it is possible at all. in view of  other unfavourable circumstances (coalshortage).    The list of goods of which the export is prohibited varies according to economicconditions.  The placing of a commodity on the list of prohibited exports as well as its eventual removal is from time to time officially published.    The effect of the control over export is, firstly, through the control of the prices,an increase in the export values and an  improvement in the trade balance, and, on theother hand, through the control of the quantities, the prevention of the selling out ofGermany, especially in raw materials, and the securing of the home requirements forthe manufacturing industry as well as  for the consumer.    The control of exports must be maintained so long as owing to the especialdifferences in  the conditions of production at home  and abroad the present differ-ences between home and foreign prices  continue or might arise as a result of  fluctua-tions of the valuta,                                  Question  10.What are the restrictions on imports now enforced in Germany?  What is the object    of these restrictions ?  What is their effect ?  How long will they be maintained ?                                   Answer.    In Germany all goods are in principle subject to the prohibition of import; only small groups  of raw material and foodstuffs are  excepted by ordinance.  Theseordinances  are  invariably  published.  Individual licences are  also  granted  on occasion.     The extent of import permits varies according  to  requirements.  Articles ofluxury and manufactured goods are excluded as far as possible.      ven the import of goods, the production of which in Germany is possible underapproximately the same conditions as  in  countries  abroad, must be restricted fromreasons of economy.     The control of imports therefore  aims at, and  has the effect of, restricting theimport  of unessential articles.   Every article of  luxury that enters  the  countryprejudices the balance of trade by the  amount paid for  it  abroad.   Germany&apos;obligations are such, however, that the German people must limit their consumptionfor  some years to the barest necessaries of life;  all unnecessary and avoidableconsumption will be at the expense of  the economic capacity of  the community as  awhole, and therefore at the expense of  her capacity for reparation.     The import control will have to be maintained  so long as Germany is compelledby the  consequences  of the war and  the Treaty of Peace  to exercise the  strictesteconomy; only when Germany has cleared off her debts will she be in a position again to consume foreign articles of luxury.
What has been the effect on German trade of the disorganisation of currency and fall    of valuta in  countries south and east of Germany, which were formerly large    buyers from Germany?  Are any remedial measures in contemplation?  Kindly    give detailed table of German  exports to these countries in 1913 and 1920.                                   Answer.    It is not possible  to answer this question here.  A  reply from  Berlin will besubmitted as soon as possible.                                 Question 12A.(Translation.)When will the system of taxation at present in force become fully effective ?                                   Answer.    It is difficult  to say.  It is impossible to judge from the receipts from taxes whenthe various taxes  will produce the maximum revenue.  This depends on the develop-ment of the general economic situation and the position of the exchange.    The development of these two factors,  however, is entirely uncertain.   If, how-ever, the question is as to the period at which the system will work normally, the answer would be that this should be the case as soon as the large extraordinary taxeshave been collected.  The fixing of these extraordinary taxes  imposes an excess ofwork on the authorities and naturally delays the collection of ordinary taxes.  the tax on war profits for the year 1919  has everywhere been paid.  The war tax  on theincrease of capital has also been,paid except in a few districts.  The payment of thecapital levy tax (&quot; Reichsnotopfer &quot;) is in  progress.    It can, however, already be said that since October the fixing  of  the varioustaxes progresses satisfactorily.  Various taxes, such as the general tax on  turnover(&quot; Umsatzsteuer &quot;), or with the company tax, will only be settled after the year 1920.This results from the law itself, since the settlement is connected with the  whole ofthe business figures (&quot; Umsatzsteuer &quot;) or with the company income in the year 1920.Both can, however,  be arrived at at the end of the year.                                 Question 12B.(Translation.)Is the  system of taxation already completely applied ?                                   Answer.    Up  to October the proceeds from the new taxes  left much to be desired.  Theresults for October, however, in the  case of the main taxes, the income tax and theImperial capital  levy tax  (&quot;Reichsnotopfer&quot;) correspond to  the expected average monthly results.  (The proof based on figures  is to  be  seen  from the &quot;Table of receipts &quot; of the 6th December, 1920, which has been submitted.)  To these are to beadded the observations on the various taxes  in reply to question 13B...                                 Question 12c.(Translation.)Are larger amounts to be  expected  in the  course of  the next three years  from the    better execution of the taxation laws and more correct declarations, without the    imposition of new taxes.                                    Answer.    1. A slight increase in consequence of  improvements in taxation administrationappears to be not impossible, since measures have been taken to perfect as much aspossible the system of collection such as,  for instance, a thorough training in account-ancy of a larger number of finance officials.  An increased income from duties could,under otherwise  similar conditions,  perhaps  also be attained with the same  duties,if the Reich were allowed by the Allied Powers to render the control of the frontierstricter than has recently been the  case by the appointment of a sufficient numberof officials properly armed.                                                 *     2.  On the other hand, an increase  in  returns in consequence of  an increase in income is hardly to be expected in the next few years.  The present high estimates for
the income tax and some other direct taxes are chiefly to be attributed to the increasein the nominal income, that is to say, to the depreciation of the value of money.  Ifthe real income rises owing to increased production and this leads to a fall in pricesa drop in  returns from almost all taxes, rather than their increase, is to be expected.The receipts from taxes are not inconsiderably increased by the considerable fall inthe value  of money.    3.  An increase  in the receipts owing to payment of the balance of taxes due forthe financial year 1920-21 is scarcely to be expected to any considerable extent. Thereceipts from taxes for the year 1920-1921 which were to be paid after the 31st march were declared in the budget capable of  being postponed,  so that such  amounts whichwere paid later could be reckoned in the accounts for the year 1920-21 which are onlyarrived at in the course of the year 1921-22.  This measure was taken on account ofthe delay  in the payment of taxes.   It should further be taken into account that thereceipts from certain outstanding taxes are more than balanced by the fact that thebudget for 1920-21 contains  considerable amounts from extraordinary taxes (warprofit taxes).  In the next budget year these will only bring in small  results andwill then disappear.                                 Question 13.How does  the revenue  from taxation at  the present time compare with the estimates?                                   Answer.    The answer to this question is given in the &quot; Review of the Government Revenue &quot;of the 6th December, 1920.    Briefly the following is to be observed from this review.  During the first halfof the year returns from direct taxes have been much less than was expected.  Thegeneral reasons for this  are:  the  transfer  of the  Tax Administration from theindividual  States to the Central  Government;  the  reorganisation and completedevelopment of the Tax Administration; the shortage of officials; the necessity for officials first of all to become acquainted with  the new laws; and the fact that it wasonly at the end of March that the legislation was completely carried through. More-over, in the case of former taxes, it always required a year of more before they came in full operation.  At  the present moment the  Tax Administration is firmly estab-lished and is working with great energy.    It can therefore be understood  that the collection of taxes is about half a year in arrear.   Nevertheless, if the income  tax returns alone for October have amountedto 1 milliard it shows  that the income tax is already working normally.  The totalrevenue up to  October from direct and indirect taxation, including export taxes, has reached 3-2 milliards, which is almost exactly one-twelfth of the sum estimated forthese items.  The October returns are therefore  absolutely normal.    As regards the individual taxes, it  is to be noted that the collection of income taxwill not be completed till after the end of  1920;  this is provided for in the law itself.The shortage in the returns from income  tax  for the first six months should thus be adjusted.    The corporation tax returns will not  be completed till after the end of the year,as the tax included the annual income of companies.  Merely advance payments havebeen made up  to now.    The capital interest tax will bring in the full amount, the  smaller returns beingdue to the fact that the Debt Administrations of the Central Government, the Statesand the communities, which have to retain the major portion of the capital  interesttax, have not yet settled their accounts.    Proceeds from the  capital levy tax should  be very considerable, especially towardsthe end of December.  There is also  a supplementary Bill before the Reichstag which provides for a more rapid payment of the capital levy tax and  the war tax,  and alsorequires the immediate payment  of a large part  of the combined tax.    The small return from the inheritance tax  is attributable to the numerous casesof inheritance tax which have not been  dealt with since the war, and which have hadto be assessed  according to the lower rates of the old tax;  in consequence the work ofden ling with the new inheritance cases has fallen badly into arrear.    The turnover tax will not bring  in its full results till after January as the generalturnover tax applies to the returns for the whole year, and, the necessary tax declara-tions cannot be furnished till January.

If some have fallen short of the estimate, others have kept pace with the estimated proceeds and may even exceed them by the end of the year.     To sum up, it may be said that in spite of the heavy task, the revenue from taxa- tion is now flowing in&apos;normally, and there is good ground for hoping that it will come up to the estimated figures.  Part of the payments of course will not come in till after the 31st March.                                Question 14A. What is the effect on the finances of the German Government of the centralisation of     the collection of taxes, having  regard to the  contributions to be made  by  the     Central  Government to  the  States and  communities?  What  effect  will this     transfer have in the future ?                                   Answer.     The  object attained by the  transfer to the Central Government of the taxes administration and by the unification of the income tax is that all assessable persons will be taxed uniformly according to the  amount  of their income or  fortune.  By this means all latent sources of taxation will be utilised.  Under the old system thereexisted inequalities due to the state of the  law, to local additions and to the various methods  of  assessment.  This is abolished  by  the centralisation.  Above all,  the centralisation of the  taxes administration will bring about as accurate an assessment of income and wealth as is possible.  The financial results should be considerable,but cannot be estimated in figures.     The  allocation of the proceeds of the income and  corporation tax between  the Central Government  on the one hand and the States and communities on the other is arranged so that the Central Government is to receive one^-fourth, the  States andcommunities three-fourths.   Of the proceeds of  the tax on real estate purchases,  the Central Government  receive one-half, the States receive 10 per cent., the communities 5 per cent.   For 1920 the total amount to be transferred from the proceeds of thesetaxes is estimated at 9-4 milliard marks, which is  to be deducted from  the total revenue of the Central Government in taxes and duties.                                Question 14B. What control is exercised by the Central Government over the sums transferred to the     States  and communities, once these sums have left  the  hands  of the Central     Government ?                                   Answer.     No control is necessary on the part of the Central Government over the applica- tion of the sums transferred.  The taxation resources of the States and communities are so limited that in order to be able to  carry on  at all they  must  necessarily administer the sums  transferred in the most economical way.                                 Question 15. (Translation.) What was the total revenue of the Reich, of the States and of the communes  during     the financial years 1913-14  and 1920-21 ?

Answer.    The estimate  required cannot  be  produced here.  Berlin  has been asked for advice.                                 Question 18,What amount is the German Government realising from the sale of assets belonging    to it which are no longer required \   How are the proceeds of such realisation    being disposed of (excluding assets earmarked for reparation under the Treaty    of Versailles)?    It should be noted in connection  with  the  data concerning  the financial year1920-    1. That they are estimates.   Receipts from taxation, export  duties, charges onbanks and small fiscal monopolies  are included  in the  receipts of the  Reich.9,400,000,000 M. which the Reich has to transfer to the States and the communeshave been deducted from  the above total so that they may not be twice brought to account.    2. The data about taxes collected by the States and communes have been basedon information received from the Reich Finance Ministry in reply to a questionnairecirculated in the spring of 1920 to the Finance Ministry of the States,  and thecommunes.    On account of the considerable increase in the number of officials in the Statesand communes, it is  certain that the revenue from taxation will not be sufficient tocover expenses.  Hence the total  for the Reich, the States and the communes esti-mated at 45 milliards 202 millions of marks will not suffice to cover all the  currentexpenses of 1920.    3. Extraordinary taxes, viz., those collected once only, either in  1913 or 1920,are as follows:  0-8 million for 1913, 4 milliard 500 million for 1920.                                  Question 16.(Translation.)Income tax at  5 per  cent, on the capital of  a German contributor, married,  without    children, after deducting  the emergency tax of the  Reich, taxation on  income    from capital and income tax.                                    Answer.
                         Total    4,838,000,000    This sum has been reckoned as arrears of revenue from loan funds so that nationaldebt is reduced by this amount.                                 Question  19.How is it proposed to provide the amount required to compensate German nationals    for the sequestration of their property in Entente countries ?   It is understood    that  the German Finance Minister has recently estimated the amount so required    at 90 milliards of marks; how is this estimate arrived at ?                                   Answer.    The  sums required for  indemnifying Germans in foreign countries  and thecolonies for the sequestration  and loss  of their property cannot be secured from current receipts, they are consequently  to be raised by loans.   Up  to the end ofNovember 1920 there has been expended in this way :                                                               M..         (a.) For indemnification of Germans  in  foreign               countries    ............    175,000,000        (&amp;.) For advances, assistance and relief on account               of losses in the German colonies...       ...     53,000,000                                                  Total    228,000,000    Compare the accompanying print &quot; The growth of the national debt from thebeginning of the financial year 1919 to the end of November 1920,&quot; page 3.    The further  amounts required for compensation  payments will be defrayed,during the financial year 1920, from the sums voted under headings 5 and 6 (page 12)of the &quot;Provisions for carrying out the Peace Treaty5&apos; : 255,000,000 M. (heading 5);25,000,000,000 M. (heading 6).  This provision has been submitted to the conference.    The 255,000,000 M. are set aside for  the granting of advances, assistance and relief in respect of losses in German colonies occasioned by the war.    From the amount of  25,000,000,000 M. are to be defrayed-    Deliveries and services under section 1, part VIII, of the Peace Treaty, such ascoal, dyes, ammonia, agricultural machinery, ships, &amp;c.  The expenses of renderingwar material useless and the destruction of specified machinery for the manufactureof war material.    Payments to Prussia for delivery of Saar coal and railway material in accord-ance with the Armistice Agreement.    Payments under clearing house system  and compensation for liquidations abroad.    Expenses of the Reparations Commission, the Allied Commissions, expenses of determining boundaries, pensions earned in Alsace-Lorraine.    Since the individual amounts of these  various liabilities cannot be fixed, a totalof 25,000,000,000 M. has been voted for the financial year 1920  so that the necessarycredit for the measures for the execution of the Peace Treaty is always available,    The Minister of Finance has now stated the total sum required for compensation payments for liquidated property to be some 90 milliards of paper marks.  So faras recollected here, this estimate is based on the calculation that German property in allied countries was valued at some 12 to 13 milliards of gold marks.  Even with a considerably better position of the German rate of exchange than at present obtains,.this value would represent a sum of at least 90 milliards of paper marks.                                   Answer.    Reference is invited to page 3, last paragraph, of the printed document already communicate (&quot; Growth of the national debt from the beginning of the  financialyear 1919 to the end of November 1920 &quot;).    The proceeds from the realisation of such assets is included in the amounts :-                                      M.                                  4,154,000,000                                   684,000,000
What is the disposal of the advance and payments received by Germany under the    Spa Agreement ?   To what extent has  the nourishment of German miners and    working classes improved ?                                  Answer.    1. The  bills of exchange arising  out of  the advance payments for coal paid under paragraph C of the Spa Coal Agreement of the 16th July of this year were applied forthwith to  payment for grain imports.   The equivalent of the 5 goldmarks in paper marks is used for the  special  allotment of cheaper foodstuffs to theminers.    2. The  sums specially allocated for  the improvement of the standard of living of the miners since the coming into  force of the Spa  Agreement have renderedpossible the  following measures :     (1.) A weekly sausage ration of 5,000 grammes and a bacon ration increased by          100 per cent., amounting to 200 grammes for each miner.    (2.) Five hundred grammes of fat  (lard  or bacon fat) per head for gangs of          miners performing 75 per cent, extra shifts.    (3.) Cheaper clothing and footwear.    In the Ruhr district also cocoa and milk foods have been distributed for sometime.    In the four months previous to the coming into operation of the Spa agreement the monthly amounts  specially applied to the  feeding of miners totalled an averageof 35 million marks;   since that time they have averaged 124 million per  month,rising in November to 190 million.    An  improvement in the feeding  of  the  remaining working population ofGermany, with the help oi&apos; the advance payments, was  rendered still less possible,since the shortage of cereals in Germany consequent on the bad harvest has been muchgreater than was estimated.                                 Question 21.(Translation.)What do the taxes on the consumption of beer, spirits, wine, sparkling wines, sugar,    tobacco, tea, and coffee, amount to ?                                   Answer.     The rates of taxes and customs duties in Germany are as follows :      Beer. 10-50 to 12 M. per hectolitre of normal beer (4J to 13 per cent, of alcohol).     This rate is halved for beer, with  a  smaller percentage of alcohol.     For stronger beer it is raised by 50  per cent.    Spirits. Middlemen&apos;s monopoly  800 M. per  hectolitre tax on 1 hectolitre ofpure alcohol.     Liqueurs, &amp;c, not distilled by the administration of the monopoly: additionaltax on alcohol of 1 M. per litre of brandy consumed.     For small distilleries where the delivery  of alcohol  is not customary, there is  a tax of 4 to 8 M. per litre.     Wine. Twenty per cent, of selling  price.     Sparkling Wines. 12 M. per bottle.     Sparkling Grape Wines. 3 M.  per bottle of sparkling fruit wine.     Sugar. 14 M. per &quot; Doppelzentner.&quot;  -     Tea-(Customs  duty.)   230 M. per &quot; Doppelzentner.&quot;     Coffee  (not raw) -(Customs duty.) 175 M. per &quot;Doppelzentner.&quot;     Tobacco-The Reicb/s taxation  has  been  computed  in the  memorandum submitted before the  Spa Conference on the taxation raised in Germany (pp. 26-27). Other details on taxation will also be found there.     The  German delegation regrets  that  it has  not at its disposal data on the corresponding rates of taxation in England and France, so that it is not possible to establish a comparison.   It requests that these data may be * communicated.  It will then establish a comparison.

Meat and meat productsFatsGovernment potatoesOther foodstuffs3-202-20 -70  15Total   ......    10-75    The recovery of the mark in May, June and July 1920, has rendered it possibleto begin the work of reducing the price of foodstuffs.   The vote of 3 milliards for1920-1921 no longer appeared in the extraordinary budget, but as a single  chargein the ordinary budget and was covered by budget revenues.  It was  therefore to beexpected that this would be the last instalment for the reduction of prices, and thatthese 3  milliards would suffice for the completing of this object.    The prices of the most important foodstuffs, meat, fats and bread,  were raisedby degrees, in order gradually to adjust the difference in the world&apos;s market prices.    Expectations have not been realised for two reasons.  Firstly, since August 1920,the mark has again depreciated, so that the difference between prices of foodstuffsin Germany  and the world&apos;s market prices increased again so rapidly that the risein prices was unable to keep pace.  Moreover, in consequence of the loss of importantceded territories in the east and north and of the exhaustion of the soil the homeharvest  has proved to be worse than expected.  The bread supply must, therefore, be supplemented by foreign grain to a greater extent than was contemplated.  The sum required for this is estimated to be at least 7 milliards of marks for the remainder of the financial year 1920-21,  and a motion to vote this sum will be put forward.  Thetotal sum. required for the reduction of food prices during the whole of the financialyear 1920-21 amounts, therefore, to 10 milliard marks.  Whether the rise in the priceof bread will render possible in the near future an adjustment with the  prices offoreign foodstuffs depends  on the further development of the rate of exchange, andthe price of grain  in the world&apos;s markets.    Since the 1st October,  1920, the immediate reduction in the price of meats, fatsand milk has been quite suspended.   Owing to the free import of meats and fats,the adjustment between the home prices and world&apos;s market prices for these articleshas been practically completed.    (6)-(a). The draft budget provisions for the financial year 1920 provide  for :                                                             Marks.    (&amp;.)

A nswers.    The questions concerning railways cannot be answered by the delegation here.    The  answer will be communicated at a later date.                                  Question 28.Kindly give an estimate of the total cost to the German budget from the armistice    up to March 1921  of (1.) Armies of occupation, distinguishing:          (a.)  Cash payments.

Reparation.(5.) Other charges under the treaty (see especially  article 297).                                    A answer.     1. According to the document communicated to the Conference &quot;Provisions forthe carrying out of the Peace Treaty for the financial year 1920,&quot; pages 10-13, therehas been voted for the cost of army of occupation :                                                              Marks.

The.periods for which the particular items of expenditure  have been incurred are in partshown in the table: generally speaking, the cost up to  the end of November 1920, canbe established.  The sum of&apos; 4,591,859,231 marks specified represents, therefore, theexpenditure by Germany actually paid and covered up to this date.  It is yet to be
401,522,915    3 to 5.  A  memorandum is  nearly  completed dealing with  the  total actualdeliveries and services, with their valuation rendered by Germany up to the presentdate in  accordance with the Peace Treaty and agreements  antecedent theretoincreased,  however,  by many milliards of paper  marks  owing  to  compensation payments for services requisitioned, which at  present are either not yet notified ornot yet fixed. But it is now to be taken as certain that for the financial year 1920 theestimated  total  expenditure of  15,525,250,000 marks  will not suffice,  and  thatsupplementary votes will be necessary.    2 to 5.  For all expenditure in the carrying out of the Peace Treaty and theagreements antecedent to it for which no special sums are earmarked  in the budgetprovision, such as, for example,  the cost of the army of occupation, there has beenvoted :                                                              Marks.

Payments to Prussia for delivery of Saar coal and railway material arising outof the armistice agreement.    Payments in connection  with the  clearing-house scheme and compensation forliquidations abroad.    Expenses of the Reparation Commission,  the Allied Commissions,  expenses of determining boundaries, pensions earned in Alsace-Lorraine.    In  the circumstances,  the  sums  required can only  be  roughly  ascertained.Consequently, it is at present not yet evident whether  the amount  voted for thefinancial year 1920 will be sufficient.    These various liabilities arising out  of the Peace Treaty cannot be estimatedindividually with exactness.  Consequently, a lump sum has been voted, so that evenin the case of  unforeseen events the necessary  credit  for the measures for theexecution of the Peace Treaty is available.    The payments made by Germany up to the end of November 1920 for the variousInter-Allied Commissions (including the Central  Government&apos;s contributions forthe administration of the plebiscite  areas) total, according to the following table,401,522,915 paper marks :                                                                 M.         1.

Question 29.Kindly give  a similar estimate to that requested  in the above question for  the    financial year 1921-22.                                   A answer.    An estimate of  the sum required for  the financial  year 1921-22 for  expenses in carrying out the Peace Treaty  and agreements antecedent to it cannot at present be given.    The budget provision for the financial year 1920-21 has not yet been passedby the Reichstag.    The preparation of the  estimate of the sum required for thefinancial year 1921-22 is in progress.    As soon as a rough estimate is possible it will be communicated.                                  Question 30.(Translation.)Kindly give a table showing curves of the issues of paper money and of the rise and    fall of valuta since 1914.                                   Answer.    One of the German tables of statistics* submitted to the  Allied  delegationsanswers question 30.                                  Question 31.What is the estimate of amount of the German paper currency which is held abroad;    and of German credits held by foreigners ?                                   Answer.    Exact figures cannot be given either of the total amount of German paper currencyheld abroad or of amount of credits granted to Germany by foreign countries.   It isfor Germany, as for all other countries, impossible to follow accurately the course which bank notes and other forms of money take, or have taken.   It is just as impos-sible to give at any  one point trustworthy statistics of the credit operations  withforeign countries in  which as is known, widely differing circles are concerned.  It                                  * Not printed.  .      [5267 d-4]                                                      E
only remains to form an estimate.  The attempt at such an estimate has been madeon pages 7  and 8 of the memorandum of the Reichsbank  respecting the german financial and currency position, submitted to the International Financial Conferenceat Brussels.   In connection with these figures one can accept for the present, accord-ing to the most moderate and cautious estimate, the amount of German money heldabroad,  and of credits granted by foreign countries at some 90 milliards of markswithout taking into consideration  the short term and long term securities of Germanorigin in foreign ownership which we must reckon at, at least, 25 milliards of marks.In the above-quoted portions of the Brussels memorandum according to the position at the end of August 1920, the uncovered debit balance of the German trade balance,that is to say, what has been paid provisionally by having recourse to credit or bypaper money, has been reckoned at more than 50 milliards of marks.  Tn the face ofthe German trade statistics as revised in the meantime this sum of 50 milliards ofmarks appears too small, probably  indeed considerably  too  small.  Hence for thepresent one arrives, at the most  cautious estimate, at least  at  the  above figure of70 milliards of marks, since it may be assumed that during the last few months the monthly debit balance of the German trade balance has not assumed a different aspectfrom that in the first half-year of 1920 when it averaged some 6 milliards of marks.     Of the total  sum of 70 milliards  of marks, less than  half  according to ourestimates consists of German paper money held  abroad, the greater part consisting ofcredits  which  foreign countries  have  granted to us.  It  cannot  be  stated  with certainty how far these credits represent mark credits, and how far they representvaluta credits.   We assume that the substantially greater portion consists of markcredits.                                 Question 32.How much foreign debt has Germany paid off since the Armistice ?                                   Answer.     The German delegation will submit later the reply to question  32.                                 Question 33.(Translation.)What is the estimate of German property in foreign neutral countries \  Comparison     between 1913 and 1919.                                   Answer.     Unfortunately, no answer can be given to this question, as there are no data.  It will be most desirable for  Germany herself  to  obtain some light on this subject.Hitherto, however, no statistic methods have been discovered which would determine the sums.  Moreover, the German delegation is not aware of any estimates (howevervague) relating either to times of peace or the present moment.                                 Question 34. What are the main causes of unemployment in Germany ?   What is the tendency ?     How does the amount of unemployment in Germany compare  with that in other     countries ?                                   Ansvjer.     Berlin is being asked for the reply to this question.  In the interim an extract from the &quot; Labour Market Gazette,&quot; No. 49, of the 7th December, 1920, is submitted. It appears  from this that the number of unemployed  entitled to unemployment pay on the 27th November, 1920, amounted to          1. Men entitled to unemployment pay     ...       ...     191,193         2.  Women entitled  to unemployment pay  ...       ...      48,071                                       Total     ......     239,264     In connection with these figures it is, however, to be observed that      (a.) They only include towns which have a population of more than 10,000.     (&amp;.) Figures are lacking from a number of towns and are not included in this            statement.     (c) The statistics  of  unemployment relief  do not  coincide  with those  of            unemployment.  The number of  unemployed  entitled  to  assistance  is            always smaller  than the  number  of unemployed,  because  not  every            unemployed person claims or obtains assistance.
     (d.)  In particular,  it is to be rioted that this computation does not include the           numbers  of  the so-called short-time workers,  that is, those who  are           employed in industries which, to avoid unemployment, do not work the           usual daily hours but a substantially shorter number of hours.     The German  delegation would  be grateful if the Allied Governments would place at its disposal  authoritative  figures  for their respective  countries as  theaccurate answering of the second part of the question would thereby be renderedpossible.                                 Question 35.What is the present price of coal in Germany to the domestic consumer ?  Is the same     price charged to the manufacturers ?  What is the relation of the price charged     to the cost of production ?                                   Answer.     It is not possible to reply to this question from the material in the possession ofthe German delegation.     Berlin has already been  asked for a statement by return.                                 Question 36.What is the available supply  of coal to Germany at the present time after deducting     Spa deliveries ?  How does the available supply compare with that of 1913 ? Is     Germany exporting any  coal beyond the Spa deliveries ?  How is the available     internal supply of  coal distributed between industry and domestic classes, and     between different classes  of industry ?                                   Answer.     The information required to reply precisely to this question is not at the disposalof the German delegation.  Berlin has been asked for advice by return.                                 Question 37.(Translation.)What are the present  conditions of  the exploitation of potash in Germany?   Can     production be increased, and how ?                                   Answer.     The necessary material to reply to this question is not at the disposal of theGerman delegation.  Berlin has been asked for information by return.                                 Question  38.(Translation.)What is the present state of exploitation of forests in Germany ?  Can this exploita-     tiori be increased,  and how ?                                   Answer.     The necessary material  to reply to this question is not at the disposal of theGerman delegation.  Berlin has been asked for information by return.                                 Question  39.(Translation.)What is the charge per head,  showing separately taxation on salaries, taxes imposed     by the States,  direct taxation and indirect taxation?                                   Answer.     It is not easy to reply to  this question.  It is only possible to use estimates. Itis certain that these estimates are much below requirements, especially in the  budgetsof the  federated States.   It should also be pointed out that the fiscal burden inGermany does not  only include the two factors mentioned in  the question, that  is tosay,  taxation by the Reich and taxation by the States, but also taxation imposed by      [5277 d-4]                                                     F
the communes, which play a great part in Germany, since the communes have consider-able duties to perform in the way of education, health and insurance.  It is, indeed,well known that in most European countries these duties education, health,  insur-ance, &amp;c. fall upon the State and are covered by State tax.  With regard to showingdirect and indirect taxation separately, this distinction is widely disputed in economiccircles; a schedule of receipts is usually  preferred.   However, this may  be, it  isgenerally admitted that receipts from taxes on property, taxes on income and on theincome from capital (tax on rents), as also receipts from taxes on capital increment,including death duties, should be considered as forming a part of direct  taxation; itis likewise admitted  that taxes  on consumption, on the transport of persons and goods,  on the exports and imports,  should be shown under indirect taxation.     It will thus be considered that taxes on banks and on the issue of paper moneymay be considered as direct taxation.  The exact computation of the burden  of direct and indirect taxation  is  only possible for the taxation  of  the Reich.  There are nostatistics for the different taxes collected  by the States and the communes,  which show direct and indirect taxes under separate heads.   The most important indirecttax not collected by the Reich is the entertainment tax,  which reaches a considerableamount in certain communes.  The States may obtain high  receipts  from indirecttaxes, principally from the stamp duty.   It is impossible  to determine by statisticswhat is the total of such indirect  taxation.   It is, however, possible to estimate themfor the States at a little more than 1-5 milliards of marks.     The  following tables give the results reached after taking into account  these general remarks.  It  should be  observed that the States create taxes  intended  tomeet payments arising out of the  increase in the salaries of officials.     On the other hand, the reply  to question 3 by France will be supplemented by the replies which the German delegation gave to questions 15 and 16 put by the british delegation: .     1.
