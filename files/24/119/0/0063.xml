1 THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITTANIC MAJESTY&apos;S.GOVERKl/ENT.                      CABINET,                   UNEMPLOYMENT                    THE  IMMEDIATE FUTURE            Memorandum by  tho Minister  of labour*3RBTt        I ask  the attention  of  the  Cabinet to  tho  very  grave        situation now facing us in regard to  the exhaustion  of  provision        for  subsistence during unemployment,  and the urgent  necessity        to be ready with  definite plans  to bo laid  before  the House        of Commons  as soon  as Parliament meets.   Immediate  legislation        will bo required  and this should be announced  in the King&apos;s        speech.            If unemployment continues at anything  like its  pre-sont  level        to tho end  of Maroh - and there  is no reason to expoot,  anything        else - tho  position will  then be that 500,000 unemployed ox-        Service mon will  have run out of out-of-work donation and from        500,000 to  700,000  other  unemployed persons will have run out        of their  eight weeks unemployment insurdnco benefit,   ^hogQ        who  have  exhausted  Benefit are numerous at  the  uresent  moment;        f-.,-- .. .------. m i. .., .. i i j - i .r-nn , n nai, m r, IM.   m JJHI R  ----        . ..------.,....RI.,   ---------mm*mmm**  rr--1- n                         (        the  exhauation of Donation will  begin in the third woek of        February, and  the numbers will increase repidly week by week.        This moans  that  round about  a million workers  (not counting        their dependants) will be penniless by the  end  of  March,            The  premium which  the Stato has  paid for  its  security so        far  as unomployed ox-Service men are  concerned has,  during the        winter, been 20s. per week unemployment donation,    But side by        side with tho  State, Poor Law Relief, private benevolence and        a recognition  of what  is  owed  by those who  did not f ipjht to        those who did, have supplemented that 20s,  in  the  very great        majority  of cases of marriod men,  certainly.    Small savings
and the pawnbroker have still further- added to the- allowance-.Do not let us he under any misapprehension.   It is not the20s. alone that has hitherto savod the situation.   Thesupplements are running out.   Poor Law Relief and privatebenevolence must inevitably exhaust themselves in the nearfuture.   And the other little resouroos are going, whore theyare not already gone.   I do not say that, 20s. may not suffice to keep the country steady, even if no longer supplemented.I hope - though I am not sure - that it may.   But I warn mycolleaguos that to decide to pay less would be a decision thatmay be fraught with disaster.     It ie moet desirable, however, that the unemployment payments to ox-Sorviec men should bo brought within the UnemploymentInsurance Act.   This is not practicable unless the same weeklyrate is paid to ex-Sorvioe men and others, and I am thereforelod to propose onoo more, that the rate for mon under theUnemployment Insurance Aot should be raised from 15s. to 20B,(with a corresponding increase for womon from 12s. to 16s.)     Tho 15s. rate undor the Unemploymont Insuranoo Act has neverin ray opinion been adequate.   It is hopelossly insufficientwith the cost of living what it is to-day.   The Labour Party(and others) assain and again tried to make it 80s. during thepassago of tho Bill  through  tho House.   A SOe. rate would not beoxcosslvo.   Evon if  tho increase in the cost of living were to fall to 50$ it would  bo equivalent to no more, than  13s.4d. on a&apos;pre-war level.     Such  a rate would go far to meet the feeling among thomore far-sighted employers  and others who, while not conceding&apos;the full  extent of  the Labour party&apos;s demands,  think that rea-sonably adequate provision  against unemployment is  an  essentialsafoguard  for our industrial system.   Moreover, a  20s. rate would be  of  immense  value  in the  remodelling  of the Poor law which must be undertaken at no distant date  it would not  abolishdestitution but, by  the  increased assistance  given  to  thrift
and self-help, It would reduce the aroa of doatltution in bad times to much moro managoablo dimensions and would effect this at relativelyemail coot to the State,   I will only add this.   Tho necessitytomako the 15a. up to 20s. ie deeply improseed upon mo by tho growing ^inadoquaoy of the 15s. as tho weeks of unemployment succeed one another- jIn the earlier woeks the workmen1s resources are there, but theyrapidly dwindle   Trade Union additions to benefit  are bcinrr steadilyexhausted, and what begins as a supplementary aid ends by boing theonly moans of subsistence.     Whatever bo the rate of benefit It is essential to grant anextension of  tho number of weeks at presont allowed under the Act, Ihad at first  contemplated confining this extension to tho period, upto next July, but after vory careful examination of the problem inall ltg bearings I am  satisfied  that this would not meet  the situation.If, as is by  no moans  unlikely, unemployment remains severe for a year or 18 months, wo should be driven  to make a series of short extensions,tho total cost of whioh would be very  great.   Tho only providentthing to do,  thoroforo, is  to lay  our  plans now for tho period up  to(say) July,  1922.                         PROPOSED  BENEFITS.     My proposals which can  be embodied in  a short Bill arc  as follows: -(l)  Ex-Sorvioo men  to be brought  within  the provisions of  the Unemploy-ment Insurance Act.(8)  As from  March 14th. 1921, tho weekly rate  of  benefit tc bo raisodto 20s.

In orderto mitigate tho severity of this rule at the outsety cctrtrl-distributors would bo allowed to draw bonefit in proportion to thofull number of contributions paid up to July, 1928, and anadditional number of 25 contributions whioh will bo credited to each contributor free.     In order to finance the inoreaered benofTtra tm&amp;*-rr-thepermanent scheme the Govormnont Actuary advises that it willbe neoessary to increase, tho weekly contributions to theUnemployment Fund from 10d. in the case of men    la.3fd^an increase of 3f d. per wook.   It is proposed that of this.increase 2d. shall be borne by the employer, ld* by the workman and fd. by the State,   Corresponding inoreasesfor women, boys and girls will be distributed in like manner.Appendix I contains a statement of tho present and proposedrates of contributions *     The Actuary estimates at  781,000 the net oxtra costto the treasury occasioned by the 3jicr^a^ed^ta4e^coi^this would? under the proposed legislation, bocome operative^as from July 4th, 1931.unemployment proves to be much above the average duringthis period tho proposals cannot bo finanood by means  ofthe  increased  contributions  alone,  and  it  may therefore  be  neoessary  to draw  upon  the  accumulatedsums  in  the  Unemployment  Fund,  which,  after  makingFINANCE.Poriod March 14th. 1921, to July 3rd, 1922.    If
 deductions for necessary reserves, amount at present te  22,000,000. Ihe  inortased contributions set out above have been m  calculated that the permanent scheme-will be financially sound even if the whole of the Unemployment irUnd has te be spent in this  way.     She Unemployment i?und would net be exhausted unless the average rate of unemployment throughout the period exceeds the  very higfc average of 9-^.  Should the rate of unemployment exeeed this average there would be a deficit which would have to be met out of theXxohqquer; the Actuary estimates that with an average rate.ofunemployment throughout the period of 12$ the defiolt to be so  met would be  12,000.000.     X would point out, however, that the average of 9^j5unemployment means that there would be not far short of a million workpeople en the average unemployed week by week for nearly 16months.  A 12$ rate of unemployment means that nearly a million and a ouarter workpeople would be unemployed week: by week fernearly 16 months.  Such a state of affairs is, I hopo and trust,most unlikely, but should it arise the state of the oountry would be cuch that expensive measures of relief would be unavoidable, and my proposals offer the best chance of reducing the  cost whicn would fall upon the Exchequer.     A copy of a Report by the Government Actuary on the proposals is attached. (Appendix XX).     I accordingly ask for authority to prepare a Bill  for giving effect to theso proposals and to introduce the Bill as a matter of urgency at the earliest possible moment.
Weekly contributions.  The increased weekly contributions from employers, employed and the State,  estimated by the  Actuaryto be required as from July 4th, 1921 and the correspondingcontributions at the present time are as follows:-How Katespresent Hatesployerct Kaployed?StateTotal., (Employ--ersoEmploy.ed 9State iIntereston investsmentsoTotal.d.6d*5d,2464ien doI2fd,44da2d,lli335: 31f10*4wsrls36$2i4542351&apos;2 0                     In ore ase ^in1 uState Qontr1butjon,     -assuming not more than-1,750*000 persons to be covered by special Schemes, and thus leaving 10.077(000 under the  general provisions of the.

Sir.         1.  In compliance with your request I have ascertained the     effect of the various proposals relative to the  amendment of the     Unemployment Insuranoe act which have lately been cUcussed in     conferences at the Ministry of Labour.         2.  It is convenient to deal with the subject in two parts:           (a) The proposed revision of the scheme in its permanent               aspect;           (b) 2he probable effect of special arrangements to oover               the period up to 1st July. 1922,             ?he proposed revision of the scheme in its permanent                               tifcl ,&apos;J G 0 I; 0         3.  It is proposed that the benofits should be permanently     raised to:                          s                         20/-  a week for men                         16/-  &quot;   &quot;    &quot;  women                         10/-  &quot;   &quot;    :T  boys                          8/-  &quot;   &quot;    &quot;  girls             It is further proposed that benefits shall besin on     the fourth da;? of unemployment as  at present and subject to the     operation of the one-in-six rule shall continue  for 20 weeks  in     any Insurance year.         4. I am advised that special schemes will probably not     become operative in respect of more than 1,750,000 persons exr     elusive of railwaymen, who presumably will either be excepted     from  insurance or will adopt a special scheme,   I have accordingly     assumed that the number of persons to be injured toou$i the Central                                                           jjfund                              1.
Fund will be 10,077,000 or approximately 1,400,000 more than thonumber includod in the estimates relative to the Act of 1920.  Asthe groups formerly assumed to go into special sohemes but nowbrought into tho Central Fund aro subject to rates of unemploymentbelow the general average the effect of this enlargement of thenumbers insured is to diminish the general average rate ofunemployment last assumed by about 5 per cent.  This, of course, isto the financial advantage of the Pund,  I have assumed further that the contributions must be sufficient to bear the oost of thebenefits without any interest from investments of the existing.fund, thus leaving the fund free to be absorbed, if necessary,in meeting&quot; the claims for the present exceptional period.  Onthese conditions the contributions should be as follows:                 Employer.    Employee.  Exohequer.    Total.     Hen             6d.          5d.      2fd         1/lfd.     Women           5d           4d       2^d          ll^d.     Boys            Sd           2*ld      if a.          6-g-a.     Girls           Bid          2d       l^d. ,         5fd.It will be observed that, under this scheme tho State contribution is one-fourth of the joint contributions of employers and employedin respect of all classes.     5.  The cost to the Exchequer under this scheme will bo 5,191,000 per year.  This represents a liability for 10,077,000persons, ana 1,750,000 in speoial schemes of  1,341,000 per yearadditional to the charge, in respect of the same number ofpersons, under the conditions as oreated by the Act of 1920*  but since the contributions are increased all round, and a sum equalto 10 per cent, of the contributions is applied as a gract-in-aid to administration, tho Exchequer will receive an additional sum of 560,000 under this hoaa, thus bringing down the effeotive extracharge on public funds to  781,000 per annum.                                                  6.
       6&quot;.    In view of the importance whioh attaches, in a periodof stress, to the statutory limits upon the &quot;benefits, I have thought it desirable to oonsider whether these particular provisionscan he further improved in suoh a way as to afford the hope that thenormal scheme aan he made to fit suoh an emergency as that whichhas now arisen.  It is obvious that if, at any time of stress,conditions are liable to arise under whioh the Government of the daywill have to seel: parliamentary powers to enlarge the expenditureon unemployment benefit the fund will oease to have an aotuarialbasis and the whole system will sooner or later impose seriousburdens upon the State.  These, moreover, will come at periods oftrade depression when the national revenue is falling and whenconsequently additional charges will be doubly diffioult to bear.  Ihave $ede oertain assumptions, based on suoh data as are available,as to the i*ratio between &quot;benefit days&quot; and &quot;days of unemployment&quot;,but there are no means of ascertaining tho effect of the one-in-six rule, and I can only say that I am satisfied from experimentsthat have been made that the oombined effect of this rule, the waiting period and the limit of ZO weeks, will be to keep the olaimwithin the ratio assumed.  If, therefore, it should be thought desirable to widen to a small  extent  the limits imposed upon  thereceipt of benefit I think that this  can be done withoutdisturbing the financial estimates.   The three days waiting periodmust, of  course, remain.   The  one-in-six rule  is equitable sinoeit imposes an automatic check  upon the benefit claims  of a somewhat  shiftless class of the community.   I have  considered whether  this rule might be modified by restoring the  ratio ofone-in-five  sot up by  the Act  of 1911 but  I understand that thereare great administrative conveniences in the ratio  of one-in-six and on the whole,  therefore, I consider  that  this rule also should remain unohanged.  But  the limit of SO weeks,  though it  is an                                                   /improvement
improvement on the present limits of 15 weeks, may,  I thinkoperate harshly in the case of people who,  normally, areregularly employed but are liable, at long intervals, to considerable spells of unemployment.  These are precisely thocases in whioh the operation of such a limit may create thepblitioal difficulties to whioh I have referred above and I thin]:,therefore, that this limit might, with advantage, be raised to26 weeke*     7.  If the olaims prove to be heavy in the period up to july 1922 it will be necessary, to avoid the recurrence of difficulties in tho earlier years beyond that date to make arrangements under which insured persons will be enabled in thoseyears to obtain benefit, in oases of necossity, irrespective ofwhat they have drawn  in the period of emergency.  I  think  it wouldbe safe to allow any contributions paid between November 1920 and july,1922, to count for the purposes of the one-in-six rule,after July 1922, without regard to benefit drawn during thatperiod.  It is further for consideration whether it would not be advisable to oredit 25 wooks to each Insured person at thecommencement of the new permanent scheme, thus following thefpreoedent of the Act of 1911*  To do this would not add materiallyto tho liability in respect of the regularly employed, while in the case of those who have satisfied the criterion ofinsurability, but are irregularly employed, it would not give more than an additional 4 weeks benefit in the year beginningJuly,1922.  I do not, of oourso, propose that these personsinsured under the old Act who have already received a oredit of25 weeks should again receive this allowanoe.     8t  If the scheme, as above outlined, wero adopted, itwould, I think, show  on the average a surplus of about  1,000,000a year,  This is not  a large surplus in comparison with the annual expenditure; it is in any event insufficient  to allow of a modification in the contributions whioh I have recommended and itis subject to certain contingencies, the cost of whioh  I  cannot                                                 /at
 at present measure, but the effect of whiob must be  reoognised.  It will be sufficient to name two of such contingencies.  The first is that of extension of liability resulting from the payment of unemployment benefit during short-tiuie.  I am told that in certain industries unemployment benefit  was paid by trade unions  during periods of short-time and  that figures relative  to such payments are  included in the date upon  which my calculations  are baaed.  It is believed,  however,  that in  other industries unemployment  benefit was  not  paid  during periods when  short-time  was  worked, and  in these  oases  the  charges whioh  are  now  being  made  upon  the Fund  are additional to  the  liability as I  have  assessed it.   The second contingency whioh  is  to be kept  in view  is the liability of  the claims upon  the  Fund  to increase with  the proposed large extension of the benefit compared with the allowances  formerly made by trade unions.  An unemployment benefit of  1   a week  has hitherto been praotioally unknown.   It has to be  paid not  only to trade unionists, well organised for  the purposes of  finding such  employment as may be available, but  to masses of people who have no such organisation to depend upon and whose success in finding work will depend in many oases much more upon  their own efforts than upon anything the Employment Exchanges can do for them.  In these circumstances I am bound to reoognise that the risk of increase in the average duration of unemployment compared with former conditions is considerable, and I am compelled to propose euch financial arrangements as will provide a reasonable margin for this eventuality.     The probable effect of special arrangements to, cover the     &quot;^period up to IsT JulyTT^^T  9.   It is proposed that under a special arrangement insured persons should be entitled  to draw 16 weeJis benefit at the increased rates ( 1 a week etc) between 14th karch,  1921, and 30th  October 1921, and a further 16 weeba, at the same rates^ ,between 31st October, 1921, and 2nd July, 1922, irrespective in
eaoh case of  the number of contributions  neid.   It is proposedto include ex-service men, at present entitled to &quot;donation&quot;,in this arrangement.   10. I find that if the contributions are increased as above proposed from July 1921 the total receipts from contributions paid, State Grant, Donation to 31st March 1921, -and interest, in the 68 wee^s comprised within the proposedemergency period will bv; about  31,600,000, or after deductingthe allowance for administration  28,650^000.  Adding to this sum the Fund, estimated at  22,000,.000, a total of  50,650,000will be available for benefits.   11. If unemployment continues to be equal to 12 per centduring the whole of the 68 wee AS, some allowance being howevermade for the  reduction of liability in the summer of 1921, Ithink that the claims on the above oasis may amount to as much as 63,000,000.   In this event, not only would the Pund be absorbed,but a deficiency of over  12,000,000 would arise in the latermonths of the period.  On the  other hand if tho average ratecf unemployment during the whole period should not be higherthan 9-g- per cent the Unemployment Fund, including currentcontributions and interest, as set out in paragraph 10 above would be adequate to meet ;,he  claims.  It is impossible to forecast the actual rate of unemployment, but it will doubtless be  sufficient to give these indications of thegeneral situation.                            I am, Sir,                             Your obedient Servant,                              f &amp;gd) AMIS) y. vVAISOI.
