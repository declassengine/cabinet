JilTT&quot;...^ 01;                Approved. in principle by the Allied            Conference In karis oh January 29th,-1921.     (l)    In  view  of the express limitations of our reference     ye  have  thought it  d,e sir able to  endeavour to look at the     problem  from the point of viev: of a private Capitalist,     considering; whether and or what terras he shell take part in the     industrial  and commercial resuscitation and development of     Austria,    khat Is the precise nature of the obstacles which     would  deter him?   And how far can such obstacles be removed by     action on the  part of -              (1)   The Allied Governments (other than a State Loan)?              (2)   The Governments of Austria or of trie 11 Successor                    States&quot;?           The answers to these questions will indicate how far     any action  of  the above kind which is practicable in present     circumstances  is likely to be sufficient by itself to clear the     way for  the effective co-operation of Allied private enterprise     in Austriaj or bow far. if at all, it would need to be supple-     men ted by direct governmental action-,     (2)    ho  should explain that we have concentrated our attention     primarily on the recuperation of Austria., and have considered.     the much  less  serious position of the &quot;Successor States&apos;1     solely in relation to the problem of Austria., because this     problem   5s fee only one which appeared to us sufficiently     acute  and  urgent to demand special consideration by the  -     Supreme Council,   So far as we can judge (without of  course     making a  special study for which there-has been no time)  Vi 3     economic  and financial difficulties of czechoslovakia, Jugo-     8 la vis and  Hungary are not beyond the  possibility of treatment     by ordinary commercial methods, supplemented by suck sida  to     credit as  are afforded,  for example,  by the 11 ri&apos;er Jleulon1&apos;  Scheme     now being organised by the  League of kablons,  or tho  kkperts     Credits Legislation  in
the United Kingdom and elsewhere - provided always that the Governments of these States pursue a reasonably prudent internal policy and remove all unnecessary obstructions to trade and communication both with the outside world and across the new frontiers within the bounds of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire.



(3) Pursuing the enquiry indicated above, the first and most obvious obstacle to Austrian resuscitation is the triple lien in all Austrian State Assets in respect of -

(1) The cost of Army of Occupation.

(2) The Relief Credits already furnished by the Allied and Associated Powers, and certain Neutral States.

(3) Reparation Claims under the Treaty of St.Germain.

We are unanimously of opinion that if the policy of attracting private capital to Austria is to be pursued all those liens must be abandoned or postponed to the utmost limits possible. It is for the ?eparation Commission to take the necessary steps so far as concerns certain of these charges. The cost of the Army of Occupation (mainly Italian) is a first charge on all Austrian Assets. The amount of Relief Credits already expended (which come next in priority) may be estimated at about £31 millions, of which about £11 millions represents the share of the United Kingdom, £10 millions the United States, and the remaining £10 millions the contributions of France, Italy and certain other Allied and Neutral States. The total nominal amount of Reparation Claims cannot be even approximately estimated, but as no one expects these Claims to be met, the only importance of the lion is that it is an effective bar to the attraction of private enterprise.

It would of course be necessary to carry with us in the abandonment of the lien for Relief Credits the United States and certain other countries, e.g. Switzerland, Holland and Scandinavian States which have participated in granting those credits. We think it indispensable that these Governments be  
                                                             ^ m approached accordingly, (4)   rfo have enquired what further liens or mortgages, if any, remain on Austrian State Assets.,      The only claims of this kind which have boon brought to our notice are      (1)  An outstanding loan of -QO million  (Paper) Crowns           on the Salt Monopoly, of which a very small proportion           is held abroad and therefore payable in geld,      (2)  Outstanding fonds on State Railways which were formerly           private enterprises guaranteed by the Stato., amounting           tc 2 milliards of Paper Crowns -oft flb&amp;tfe ft .larg*           part is probably hell internally;      Neither of these matters seems of material importance for the  present purpose, but cf course it would bo necessary to verify the  absence of any other (especially foreign) claims on Austrian Assets bofore private capital would accept thorn as security,. Subject to this woi mav say that the obstacle ,to r/gsuscjLtation offered- by;^^^chpr^es^ on (Au^tir?-E3:L.it?^Ms- M ^capable of being romoved by the act^of^renunciation on the part^of tho Allied and other Governments which wq have recommepdecL (5)   The next set of obstacles which a Capitalistic group would find in its way are those offered by the complete financial disorga- nisation of the Austrian Stato.,   The facts have been so clearly brought out in the reports of the Austrian Section of tho Reparations Commission that it is unnecessary to go into thorn in detail. The  outstanding-features are -      (1)  The rapidly depreciating v -change,      (2)  Tho widening gap between public Income and expenditure           which is met by tho printing press, thus accentuating           the depreciation of currency,  and simultaneously           Increasing the deficit in the Budget owing to the           neoossity of making purchases of necessaries  abroad, So long as those  conditions continuei  they present great difficulties&quot;in the  way cf hypotheticating the Revenue of (say) the  Salt and Tobacco Monopolies to secure  External Credits or loans, since those  revenues  are a large element in the already insufficient public  income.
     Henoo the reform of tho public finances of Austria by cutting clown expenditure and increasing income seems a necessarycondition of national rehabilitation by private or other creditsfrom abroad*     A material increase of income night perhaps be obtained byleasing the Monopolies mentioned  (and possibly certain others)to private management.   Any material decrease of expenditure,however, involves very difficult political a-d social considera-tione, since it is certain to involvo wholesale dismissalsof redundant civil, military and railway employees,(6)  rJ?ho Reparations Commission estimate that there are 80,000redundant railway employees and 10^000 redundant&apos; Civil Serviceofficials; and if to this cstimato (whioh seems to us to bobelow the mark) we add 20,000 soldiers demobilized to reduce theArmy, and say 10,000 redundant employees of local and provincialauthorities, tho Austrian Government would bo faoed vrith thenecessity of dismissing at least 60,000 public employoes, fortho bulk of whoir no alternative employment is immediately available, and who must therefore under present conditionscontinue to be a burden on public funds *   Moreover, in ouropinion this is only, a small part of the problem which will eventually have to be faced, i*e8 the gradual re-distributionof tho redundant population of Vienna so as to cease to be aorushlng burden on tho reduced Austrian Stato, and to be grad-ually absorbed in useful productive work   This problem has onlyto be stated for its immense difficulty to be approciated*   Itcan obviously only be dealt with by Government action;  it must take a long time, and any projects organised by the Statefor this purpose while leading to economies in tho long run,must at the outset involve considerable capital expenditure,     Yre recommend that as an essential element in any schemefor assisting Austria with external credit, she be required                                                         with/
with tho aid  of  tho small  financial Board  suggested belowto frame and give offoot to a oomprehonsivo scheme for -     (1)  Reducing her public services within reasonable limits.&apos;     (2)  For redistributing the redundant employees in            productive work.     The above reforms while they will diminish the financialdisorganisation  of Austria will bo insufficient of themeelvesto r Oil tore financial stability, unless thoy are accompanied byan effective control ov^r  the issue of paper money.  This im-portant matter is cbalt with in a later part of this report.     The next group of obstacles to which  wo call attention arcthose afforded by tho obstructions to commercial intercourseand communications between Austria and all the surrounding Statescaused by the Customs am-  other restrictions and prohibitionsimposed at the now frontiers by those now  States.   Austria asa landlocked State is peculiarly dependent  on the good-vvill ofher neighbours for her commercial outlets.    -o may say thatovving to various circumLtancee, including  of course the statoof Austria&apos;s currency,  the Successor States have thought itnecessary to safeguard  themselves by imposing prohibitions andrestrictions which have undoubtedly aggravated Austria&apos;s economic difficulties,    V/o are glad to Know that a Conference of the successor State:; has been called by the Reparations Commission   .to consider these and other matters, and we     recommend   thatthis Conference  should te a place as soon.  as. possible and that thePrincipal Alii ad -States should be officially represented thereatand should use their influence to secure a substantial ameliorative-tion ov the present u satisfactory conditions, and as near an approach to internal x..oe trade and cornmunic-.tione within theLrea oi tne old AUS tro-Hungarian Smpirj as the circumstances                                                     &quot;oermit.-
      To  the  formidable  obstacles already enumoratee to the , ttraotion of  foreign capital  to Austria on business termsmu^t  bo  added  tho  fear  of confisoatory taxation,  Do doubt the postponement of  reparation claims wo aid So something to diminishthis  fear, but it  is to bo expected that stringent guaranteeswoulo1 be reouirod  by any capitalist group boforj investing&apos;c pital  ii] i  u&amp;tria.      l7o  now  turn from examining the obstacles which unlessremoved would  discour-go tho private capitalists from ma icingAdvances to Austria, to tho second point on which suchcapitalists would require to be assured viz; what are thoattractions which a resuscitated Austria can eventually offorin the way of  possibilities of development which IJ realisedmay Ultimately reward the capitalist who is willing to takerisxs in order to assist in putting Austria on her foot?      On  thiti point our information is by no moans complete,but such data  as have boon put before- us tend to show thatthe development  of water power presents groat and attractivepossibilities  which a capitalist group might thinx worthexploring.   Another possibility that has boon suggested the o jvolopmont  of paper manufactu.ro.   But all these and similar matters  can only.be thoroughly investigated by com-petent business  experts on the spot, who alone could form a sound opinion  as to the value of thjso possibilities.     An outline scheme has been put before us by ivULoucheurwhich is given in full in Annexe 1 to  this  Report to create(a)  a commission or other organ of control to supervise thejj&apos;ina:icjo of Austria, including the is QUO of currency,  andait nor directly  or indirectly to supervise the administrationof any .;tato revenues that may - be pledged for future credits;(%)  on International Industrial Commercial and Banxinc Corneanyto perform certain functions explained in the -ichome,   The
                                                    * **. *&quot;constitution of tho commercial -company, .: nd thj provision ofcredits through    its moans, and its precise relation to thocontrol of Austrian Finance will obviously raise difficult questions when &apos;&apos;;no project comes to bo examined by business and financial houses as a practical proposition,and the last sentence (which suggests State guarantees forthe first advance) may appear to Lo outside&apos; our reference.Nevertheless, we consider that in the present emergency and in view of the strong political and other reasons infavour of ma icing every possible effort to avoid Austria1 scollapse, the scheme should bo submitted by tho principal .Allied Governments to suitable capitalist groups in theirrespective countries, and that the  representatives of suchgroups as are prepared to give serious consideration to the         toscfyerne oryany acceptable variant thereof should be invitedto confer together at an oarly dato*     As regards tho proposed Control of Austrian financeswhich is an integral part of the scheme, we pro inclined  toprefer a small Board of Expert Financial Advisors to boappointed by tho Austrian Government with the approvalof the Allies, on conditions ensuring them sufficientfixity of tenure and independence to be able to performtheir difficult and delicate duties.   Uo do not favouran International Commission of delegates Instructj&amp; by their various Governments, as this would, in our opinion, involvethese Governments in responsibility for the Governmentof Austria to a degree which we do not believe &quot;they will  be willing to under tax e.     &apos;.&apos;e a o not thinx that the Board  ofAdvisors should be directly armed with coercive powers exce  tperhaps to veto any proposed issue of paper money, but thatthey should be authorised to report fully to the Allies asto tho measures tax on or not tax on to give effect to their advice.   The fear of losing all further credits will in  our
       our opinion &quot;be a powerful Indue erne nt to the Austrian Govern-       ment to follow the advice tendered to them.(13)        It is by no means our expectation that the scheme  which       we propose will duplicate or render unnecessary 30 far  as       conoern3 Austria,  the various sohemes for facilitating  the       grant of International Commercial credits,  which at present       exist or are contemplated.  In particular we may mention the       so-o-alled &quot;Tor K^ulen&quot; soheme of international credits       recently adopted by the League of Nations,  the Export Credits       Scheme in operation in the United Kingdom,  and the Edge Act       in the United States.  Hitherto,  however, it has heen quite       impossible for Austria to comply with the conditions of any       of these schemes in view net only of her total financial       disorganisation,  but of the fact that all her State Assets       are already pledged several times over.  It is our hope       that one beneficial effect of the adoption of the measures       which we recommend will be tc put Austria in a position for       the first time to benefit by participation in these credit       schemes, and the Financial and Commercial Organisation  which       we contemplate ought if successfully established to be  a       useful medium for assisting this participation,(14)         Lastly, we would state, so that there may be no mistake       as to our views,  that even if all the above recommendations       be adopted we are by no means certain that the effecl/will be                                               have       to rehabilitate Austria permanently as we j.m  sufficient infer-       mation to arrive at a definite conclusion.  We have already       pointed out the many practical obstacles which may hinder the       operation of the scheme.  It may be found that the evils from       which Austria suffers are so acute and deep seated that they       cannot be effectively cured, without a degree of assistance       from other Governments which we are not authorised to consider.
Aa, horn ver, we understand that it is considered to he a matterof great urgency and importanoe from a political and esonomiopoint of view that no means shall he left unexplored to arriveat a solution of tho. problem referred to us,  we commend theabove recommendations to the favourable consideration of theSupreme ecu noil.
