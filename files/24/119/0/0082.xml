In view of a further memorandum (CP.2542) bythe Food Controller asking for a Cabinet decision onthe question of the continuance or removal of thecontrol on imported meat after March 31st, it isdesirable to draw the attention of the Cabinet to thememorandum (CP.2250) circulated by Lord Milner onDecember 7th last.   The unpopularity of control in thiscountry may be a temporary and sectional affair.   Theresentment created in the Dominions is of a nationalcharacter and calculated to have permanently injuriouseffects on inter-Imperial relations.   It is to be hopedtherefore that the Cabinet will endorse the FoodControllers recommendations and terminate the MeatControl on March 31st.In the absence of a Secretary of State forthe Colonies, I am circulating the above note -at...Mr.Churchill&apos;a request.L. S. AMEftf.
