(Circulated with Reference to C.?o2494)                           THE IMPERIAL CO .MERCIAL ASSOCIATION                            President: The Rt. lion-Lord Inch cape                                4, Cull urn Street,                                    LONDON; E.C.3,       The Executive Committee of the Imperial CommercialAssociation having regard to the present depression of trade which affects every mercantile and industrial undertaking and is the cause of so much unemployment, protest mostvigorously against the further introduction of minimum wagesby Trade Boards;, and suggests that a suspension of minimum wage rates until the present crr-jiu is past would have animmediate effect on the unemployment question.       Representatives of large wholesale and retail houses in the Grocery  and Pre,vision Trades,, for which the trade board proposals will shortly ccme into force, view with thegreatest apprehension the effect of the new minimum wages to be imposed.-at this time of stress, and have assured theCommittee of-this Association that the inevitable resultmust be an increase in the number of the unemployed owingto the retrenchment which will be necessary.       For example, many pensioners and other elderly people who are additions to the permanent staff must be  dispensed with if businesses are to be kept solventand all furtherapplicants for  employment must be turned away.       As the Grocery and Provision Trades constitute one of,if not the largest; distributing agencies in the  country.the effect of the new proposals  riil be widespread and immediate.       The Executive Committee of this Association, therefore,urges upon the  Government to delay putting into force proposalswhich must not  only swell ihe ranks of the unemployed but will also impose at a critical Line greater burdens uponemployers in these trades than they can possibly beart2.
