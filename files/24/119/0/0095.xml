This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.---&quot;572SECRET. 13CR 2594.THE CABINET.LIMITATION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TO FIRMSON THE KING&apos;S ROLL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a Memorandum prepared by the Contracts Department of the     81War Office in which the practical difficulties which this Department will have to meet ^en- Nain carrying out the terms of the Cabinet decision on this question on 28th January    J,,2i(Cabinet 4 (21)) are pointed out.L. W.-E.The War Office,16th February, 1921.Preference in awarding Government Contracts to Firms on the King&apos;s Roll.1. The Contracts Department desire to make the following observations on theCabinet decision of 28th ultimo that, &quot; when a tender for a Government contractis received from two or more firms, in the event of the lowest tender being receivedfrom a firm not on the King&apos;s Roll, then ceteris paribus such tender should becommunicated to that firm of the firms on the Kirig&apos;s Roll making the lowest tender,and the contract should be definitely offered to such firm on that basis.&quot;2. This procedure, by its subversion of the long-established rule by which allquotations are treated as confidential, and by its departure from the principle that incompetitive tenderings the contract is allocated to the lowest suitable tenderer, islikely to weaken the confidence of the trade in the impartiality of Government Depart-ments, and to give serious grounds for complaint to those competitors whose prices aredisclosed. The fact that the name of the firm quoting the lower price is not divulgedwill not in many cases be sufficient to hide that firm&apos;s identity.3. There are serious practical difficulties in giving effect to this instruction : (i.) Limitation. The procedure cannot be applied at all to Ireland, where, by thedesire of the Ministry of Labour, we have refrained from putting pressureon firms to enrol, and the number of enrolled firms is negligible.It cannot be applied to the engineering trade, which has not yetadopted the enrolment scheme, nor the coal mining industry, which isexcluded from that scheme by the Ministry on the grounds that it absorbsits own disabled employees. Other exceptions will, no doubt, be inevitablein trades where the work is not suitable for disabled men.It is further conceded by the Ministry that the procedure is not toapply to firms employing less than 25 hands, but contracting departmentshave in most cases no exact information as to the number of hands employedby firms.In any case the administration of a scheme hedged with so manylimitations and exceptions would be bound to be a matter of great compli-cation and difficulty. -(ii.) Incomplete information. It is not at present possible to obtain completeinformation as to what firms are now enrolled. The Ministry of Labour isfurnishing this information as regards the firms on the War Office lists, butit has not yet completed the first two letters of the alphabet. Reference tothe Ministry in doubtful cases would involve intolerable delay, especially asit would not infrequently have to refer to its local Employment Committeeson whom the administration of the enrolment scheme has been devolved.(1321/93)   100  2/ai  H&amp;S, Ltd 896 Iwo
(iii.) Cases of liRings&quot; or &quot;Arranged Prices,&quot; The difficulty of dealing withcases of &quot; rings &quot; or &quot; arranged prices &quot; would be largely increased under theproposed procedure, especially in cases in which the lowest tenderer wasoutside or had broken away from the combination.4. Apart from these practical objections, the scheme must in our opinionnecessarily cause increased expenditure, not only by entailing considerable extra labour(at a time when the utmost pressure is being exerted to reduce staff to a minimum),but also by seriously restricting competition, since many firms who do not see their wayto enrol will be reluctant to quote on what they will regard as unfair conditions.5. In these circumstances it is submitted that the decision arrived at on the28th ultimo should be reconsidered, and that, if this decision cannot be entirelywithdrawn, discretion should be given to the purchasing departments to depart fromit in exceptional cases where in their judgement the circumstances necessitate sucha course.Failing this, it is suggested that the whole question should be referred to aCommittee on which the Departments interested should be represented, with instruc-tions to submit without delay recommendations as to the steps to be taken with a viewto inducing firms to join the Kings Roll.
