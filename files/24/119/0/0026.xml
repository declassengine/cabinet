/(P 060)            PVo?n Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,           1302                                31st January 1921.                                 (Received 4 p.m.)     Clear the lino.     130 S.   Secret.  Afghanistan.  Following from Dobbs, 30th January: &quot; Nawab-had private  interview  with  Tarsi yesterday  about Shakar  Khan&apos;s  case which wastemperately discussed.  Nadir Khan came in towards the end. and he and Tarsi spokeat  length  to  Nawab  about  &apos; impasse&apos;  over  clause  8.   Tarsi seemed disturbed atprospect of collapse of tho negotiations, but, Nadir  was quite intractable and said  atone point: &apos;  Even il: Tarsi signed a  treaty on lines of  the Mussoorie Conference,  Ishould refuse to accept  it.&apos;  Unless therefore  Amir throws his weight upon Tarsi&apos;aside, which, is not very probable, there  is  little hope  of continuance of negotiations.I shall wait until they have had full time to consider our  Persian translation of short-hand  record of long discussions on clause 8, which they will (? receive) this evening.If they then make no move, I shall ask for a definite reply as to whether they accept our views on questions of tribes and frontier, as in default of acceptance, I must break off  negotiations.   They will  probably desire  final interview,  in which case I  shallexplain to them  forcibly, consequence of  refusal of the British point of view.  BothNadir and Minister of Commerce  have  stated,  that  if negotiations break down, thereneed be no difference in our present relations, as we have got on quite comfortablysince Rawalpindi Treaty without  Treaty of Friendship.  I propose to  say, in  additionto other arguments that this is  fallacy.  Ever since Rawalpindi  Treaty we  have(? shown) extreme forbearance regarding  numerous  incidents, because we  hoped thatAfghanistan would realise  the importance to  her  of  our  friendship, and  we  were anxious to avoid every possible obstacle even at risk of appearance of weakness.   Infuture we shall take without hesitation,  any measures judged necessary for our security or honour.&quot;
