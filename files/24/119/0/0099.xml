582finis try of Shipping.16th February 1921.0(2)      The Controller la of opinion that the time has comewhen Britain should have, (if not a Minister of Marino), aParliamentary Seoretary, attached to a Department of theGovernment, whioh in the Controllers opinion should he theBoard of Trade.    In many other countries there is a Minister^f Marine, and it is vital that British mercantile interestshkdd be mpre oloeely watched in the future than in the past.Legislation is taking place in many countries whioh willundoubtedly affeot the future of British shipping, and closeattention should be given thereto.The competition which British shipping rauat meet inthe future will be more serious than ever before, and as theBajpire ia dependent for its very existence oh a great mercantilemarine, there is every reason to watch closely its interests.with this in view it is suggested for consideratIon:-(a) That one Government department be appointed notonly to liquidate all war work, but also be charged inthe future te look after all Government shipping workand the general interests of mercantile shipping intime of peace, (having ever before itv(9X pt)5*il*lilties)and that suoh department should be affiliated to theBoard of Tirade, not  only on account of the Board ofTrade1s past and present otnnection with shipping,but because it is the Ministry directly concernedwith Trade.(b) There may not be sufficient ease for appointing aMinister of Marine, though this practice obtains inother countries, but   in the Shipping Controller1sopinion there is much reason for establishing a&quot;Mercantile Marine Department&quot; as above suggested witha Parliamentary Secretary attached to the Board   ofTrade.It is believed that the Shipping industry as a wholewould welcome such an appointment, both shipowners and men alike.( Signed )  J.P.
