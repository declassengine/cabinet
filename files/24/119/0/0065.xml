This  document is the property of His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.    313SECRET.-CP. 2564.THE  CABINET.INDIAN  MILITARY  EXPENDITURE.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.    In his Memorandum of 24th December (OP. 2362) on Indian Military Expenditure,___the Secretary of State for India stated:   &quot;It is  also definitely impossible for us tomake any contribution to Imperial defence, whether in the form of-    (a.)  A subsidy based on population,    (b.)  An increased capitation grant,    (c.)  An  increased contribution to the  cost of the Royal Navy,    (d.)  The maintenance of an Indian Navy (at present);and I would  ask. those of my colleagues who are directly concerned to note this.&quot;    In support of his position, the Secretary of State for India quotes figures,.preparedby the Secretariat of the League of Nations for the Brussels Financial Conference, toshow the relative incidence of military expenditure in various countries, from which itappears that the proportion of defence expenditure to total expenditure is 357 percent, in the case of India a proportion exceeded only by Japan and Greece 16*8 percent, in the case of the United Kingdom,  and 11 &quot;2 in  France.    These figures are misleading for the purposes of Mr. Montagu&apos;s argument.  In thetotal expenditure of the United Kingdom are  included charges  such  as  Health and unemployment Insurance which have no relevance to  a  country in the present stage ofdevelopment of India, as well as the huge  sum now required for the service of the  debt.It will hardly be  aigued that  the more War Debt the United Kingdom carries, thegreater should be its share of current charges for the Defence of the Empire.    It is at least equally instructive to look at the figures in the  shape of the chargeper head of population.   I annex a  table on these lines (Appendix), from which itwill be seen that the native  of India pays 2s. a year towards the defence of  Indiacompared with a payment of  bl. by an inhabitant of the United Kingdom.    The  figures in this table  for continental countries are, of  course, greatly affectedby the present level of rates of exchange.    I am not sure what is  meant by the refusal to pay  &quot; an increased capitationgrant.&quot;   If it refers to the sum per head of the British Force in India paid to the WarOffice annually in respect of the  cost  of  raising and  training troops for  India (called the &quot; effective Home charges &quot;) I am afraid  I must rejoin that the War Office cannot continue  to supply troops to India on  any other terms  than the payment by her of asum fairly representing the cost to the British taxpayer, which has (like all other  costs)increased very largely since 1914.
