In addition,this draft contains provisions ior      certain supplementary troops and lor other military      organisations which are act clearly defined,       (^)   Organisation*            She effectives of certain services and a considerable      number of military nen-eifectiv.es, are not included in the      army of 100,000 men.            The number of officers and military officials      belonging to the Central Administration (Ministry of the      Reichswohr and tire Administrative Departments attached      to it) is considerably in excess of the number authorised      by the Treaty (916 instead ox 30C ).  2.  Surrender and Destruction of gar Efateriol.           In spite of the largo quantities of war materiel      surrendered and destroyed up to tho present, the disarmament      of Germany is still far from being completed.   The      following points are oi special importance:-           (i )  An important surplus exists on account oi the                  act that tho reduction&apos;of the strength of                  the army to 100*000 men has not been acoom-                  panied by a surrender oi war materiel propor-                  tionate to this reduction,
(ii) A large quantity of war material is collected in units in depots or in arsenals. Moreover, the German Government claims to retain, under the guise on material required for purposes of replacement and training, quantities considerably in excess on these fixed by the Treaty.



(iii) Finally, a considerable number of arms remain in the hands on the civil population.



-Moreover-



(iv) The German Government, in its Note of the 24th December, has refused to carry out the decision on the Conference of Ambassadors of the 8th November, and has delayed surrender of the artillery material of Custrin, Lotzen-Boyen and Junigsborg, and the surrender of heavy artillery in excess on that sanctioned by the I.A.M.C.C.

(vi) The German Government has refused to carry out the decision of the Conference of Ambassadors of the 27th December, and has appealed to the Allied Governments against this decision. It has thus postponed the surrender of material not authorised for coast fortresses. It claims the retention of 1086 guns instead of 420 authorised by the I.A.M.C.C.



(vii) Further the abolition of establishments and military factories, which comes under Article 168 of the Treaty, and the destruction or conversion of machinery used for war purposes, under Article 169, have not been carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down.



Unauthorised Organisations.

The German Government, in its letters of the 9th and 22nd December, claims the right to retain these organisations in Bavaria and in East Prussia, and to postpone their disarmament to an indefinite date, which it desires to fix itself.

The majority of the arms not authorised for the Sicherheitspolizei


Sicherheitspalizei have been surrendered.  But the Slcherheits-polisoi has been simply transformed into the Schutzpollsoi (newdesignation Qt tho German Police Force), whilst retaining itsxormer composition and organisation,    .  .
