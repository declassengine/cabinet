WEEKLY SURTO OF T?H ST.ATF_.OF.,.TR^LAND FOR TOK                     EfrTTID JANUARY 51st,, 1921.         (Circulated by the Chief Secretary for&apos; Ireland),          I submit for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey   for the week ended the 51 st ultimo..   GFNFRAL STAT^ OF tTH7 COuTOY,          The total number of specially reported outrages is   considerably less  than that for the previous week? but the   reduction is chiefly due to a  falling off in the number of   raids upon mails.    So far as  the more  serious forms of crime   are concerned there has., I regret to state,  been no sensible   improvement, and the casualties inflicted upon the Crown Forces   hove again reached the same exceptionally high figure (33) as in   the previous week;   The greater number of these casualties   were sustained in  ambvishes of  motor lorries; but several attempt-   ed assassinations  of individual policemen were reported, and the   week1 B  death roll  includes the cases of two  R*I*C. Constables   who were  murdered  in their bedroom in s Belfast Hotel&apos;on the   26th ultimo, a third Constable being dangerously wounded on the   same occasion,,          The most serious ambush of the week took place on the   28th ultimo, when  a. Divisional Commissioner  (-4r* Holmes) of the   R,-I*C,.  and a$ escort cf six police travelling in  two Crossley \   touring cars were  attacked near Castle island (Co-  Kerry).  The   ambushers  numbered about 50 and used two machine guns*.   One ofF&apos;.ET oj  Orr,o-Or
Police constables was shot dead and the remainder of  theparty were wounded and disarmed.   The Divisional Commissioner,an extremely able and efficient officer with a very gallantrecord in the late &apos;&quot;ar, died the following morning from theeffects of his wounds *        Another important en^n n-ement took place on the same day which to some extent off-set this very regrettable incident.A party of military operating in the Ballincollig District,Co. Cork, encountered an ambush in course of preparation nearCoachford, and after a sharp fight in which at least  one ofthe raiders was killed, succeeded in making ten prisoners,five of whom were wounded, and in capturing a large quantityof arms and ammunition.   No military casualties weresustained on this occasion.        Eight attacks upon occupied polics Barracks were reported during the week but the attacks were in every caseunsuccessful, and the only casualty sustained by the  policewas one case of woundiujri   The military and eelice barracksat Bandon; 0o* Cork, were attacked simultaneously on the 24thultimof but the rebels were completely beaten off with theloss of one of their number killed.        Two Sinn Fein murders of civilians were reporteddurini the week, the motive in each case being, apparently,the  suspicion that the murdered man had divulged informationof the movements of the Republican forces to the militaryauthorities A        Raids on mails fell from 37 to 11,   This improvement is no doubt due to the action recently taken by the PostOffice in suspending the Mail Car Services in districts where attacks have been most frequentn  .        Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered
   99 for the week.   Trials of Civilians  by Court Mart!alP           One hundred  and forty-one trials  0**  civilians by   Court Martial took place duriny the week  and resulted ih ;   one hundred and twenty-two  convictions  and nineteen  acquittals.   The following&apos; is  an  analysis of the sentences  Imposed:-           1 Sentence of Detention during  His Majesty&apos;s pleasure             on conviction for murder.          63 sentences  of penal servitude  (periods  ranging from                                            3 to  10 years).          39, sentences  of imprisonment with  hard  labour (periods                                        from 4  months to 2 years).           7 sentences  of imprisonment without  hard labour (28 days                                   - - &apos;1         to  1 year)*           1 sentence of 6 months detention  (soldier).           1 Fine of  10. with 28 days  imprisonment without hard                                   labour  in case of default.           2 Fines of  5.Total    114           In one of the remaining eight cases  the  accused was   required to enter into his  own recognizances to  &apos;be of good   behaviour for a year, and in the other  cases the sentences   were remitted by the Confirming Officer.           Of the above cases, five were cases  of ordinary   crime and the remainder offences arising  out of  the  Sinn   Fein movement, the offence  in the majority  of  the cases   being the possession of arms and ammunition  or seditious   documents a   The murder conviction  was  that  of Cadet Harte   who was convicted of the murder of  Canon  Magner  and   To Crowley on the 5th December, 1920, but was  found  to have   been insane at the time of  committing the act0   The   sentences of penal servitude included fifty-eight sentences   of five years Imposed for the offence of  assembling.at a

The postponed hearing of &quot;fche oase of Rex v JosephMurphy to which referenoe was made in my report for theweek ended the 17th ultimo was oonoludod&quot; in the KingTsBench Division yesterday* .  It was sought on behalf ofthe prisoner who. is now lying under sentence of death inCork prison after oonviction for the murder of a soldier,to quash tho proceedings of the Court Martial by a writ ofoertiorari on the ground that tho prisoners oounsel hadbeen deprived by an erroneous ruling of the Court Partialof the right of oross-examining.two witnesses for the,  :.                                           prose bit ion/
         prosooution,  on thoir&quot; ovldenoe  given at&apos; a &quot;militaryinquiry         in lieu of inquest,  into  the  death  of the murderer  soldier.         The  Attorney-General who  appeared for the crown  contended         it was  not competent for  the  High Court to  interfere.   In         delivering the  unanimous  judgment of tho Court,  the Lord-         Chief Justice maintained  that the Court Martial  being  an         Inferior Court  was  subjeot to the limited control  of tho         High Court and  quoted a dictum  of Lord Loughborough to the         effeot  that if  a Court Martial  aots without or in  exooss         of jurisdiction,  the Zing&quot;s Benoh division  oan exorcise         its authority by writs of prohibition or Certiorarl to stop         or quash tho  prooeedings  or by  writ of Habeas  corpus against         tho  Governor  of the  Prison by whom  the prisoner  is detained *         In the  present  oase, ho-ever, the prisoners  appeal rested         on the  ground that  the Court  Martial had given an  erroneous         ruling  on a point of evidence,  and  there was  no  precedent         for regarding a mistaken  ruling on  ovidenoe as fatal to         jurisdiction  of a Court Martial which admittedly had been         regularly constituted or  a ground for intervention by,the         High Oourt.  Looision in the case  was^ then given  in the         following terms :.              &quot;After a oar of ul examination of the principles and           authorities governing the case, .we are of opinion that,           although the  court martial  have an orroneous deoision in           point of law, .it  was a  deoision m.\de intra  vires, and does           not entitle tho accused to  the relief sought in  the  present           aoplioation.    7e dosire,.howovor,.to add that while, in           consequence of our decision,  we havo no   :owor  to  ivo any           further stay  of execution,  .we think that  the prisoner should           have  an opportunity of  making any application  that he may           desire In aooordanee with the provisions  oi the  Army, \.ct  and           the Eingl&apos;v  Aefytil.&quot;tiOns, and that  a reasonable  time should  be           allowed to  him for the  purpose&quot;.
