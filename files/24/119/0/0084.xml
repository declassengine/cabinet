PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The unemployment position does not improve, and continues to dominate the generalindustrial situation, which remains quiet. The position of those unemployed personswho will shortly have exhausted their right to benefit under the Unemployment InsuranceAct, 1920, and of those ex-Service men and women who are in a similar position as regardsout-of-work donation, is causing anxiety. In preparation for the adjourned Joint LabourConference on Unemployment, which is to meet on the 23rd February, trade unions andlocal Labour Parties are taking steps to consider their policy with regard to the report ofthe Special Joint Sub-Committee which was adopted by the conference. A joint conferenceof the London Trades Council and the London Labour Party will be held on the 19th Feb-ruary to consider the proposed Labour policy.The reply of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives to the Govern-ment&apos;s proposals of the 18th December, for the augmentation of labour in the buildingtrades by the absorption of not less than 50,000 ex-Service men, was published on the 4thFebruary, when it was announced that these proposals had been emphatically rejected.The Federation reiterated their arguments against &quot; dilution,&quot; but made no detailedreference to the Government^ offer of compensatory payments.The Tramways Court of Inquiry have adjourned until the 15th, in order that theundertakings may, in the interval, prepare certain returns asked for by the chairnlan.There are indications that organised Labour intends to make greater use of the machineryset up by Part II of the Industrial Courts Act in order to compel employers to justify,in public, their refusal to meet what are felt to be the legitimate demands of their work-people. The Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, in view of the recentrefusal of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation to grant an advance in wages of 6d.per hour, and to give any undertaking with regard to the stabilisation of wages, haveappointed a deputation to meet the Minister for the purpose of asking him to set up aCourt of Inquiry to investigate the financial position and prospects of the shipbuildingindustry ; and the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen andClerks are also reported to be contemplating similar action in view of the refusal ofcertain West End stores to grant their demands. Employers&apos; organisations, on the otherhand, with a view to reducing costs of production, appear to be concentrating attentionupon the administration of the Trade Boards Acts. The Association of Jute Spinnersand Manufacturers, for example, have asked that the flax and hemp trade shall beexcluded from the operations of &quot;these Acts.Negotiations between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the National Unionof Railwaymen, concerning their differences as regards railway shopmen, have continuedduring the week, but no definite result has been achieved.The announcement of the Secretary for Mines, that the Government have decidedto remove, as from the 1st March, Government control of the. pit-head price and the inlanddistribution of coal, has attracted considerable attention. With regard to the negotiationsbetween the miners and owners, delegate meetings of the constituent bodies of the Miners&apos;Federation of Great Britain have been held during the past week-end to consider thequestionnaire which was circulated by the Executive Committee, and it is understood thatthe matter will be further considered by branch meetings during the current week.The new session of Parliament will be opened on the 15th February.The Unemployment Position.Statistics. The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donationpolicies lodged in the United Kingdom on the 28th January was 341,816, of which 322,334were lodged by men and 469 by women totally unemployed, and 18,837 hymen and 176 by
General Situation-continued.women working short time. On the 21st January there were 324,318 policies lodged, ofwhich 307,276 were lodged by men and 442 by women totally unemployed, and 16,451 bymen and 149 by women working short time.On the 28th January in the United Kingdom. 1,280,242 unemployment books remainedlodged under the Unemployment Insurance Act, of which 371,546 were lodged by menand 289,555 by women totally unemployed, and 235,900 by men and 383,241 by womenworking short time, an increase on the previous week of 41,338 totally unemployed and17,147 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdomon the 4th February was 1,107,942. The above are advance figures provided by theEmployment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 163.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Industrial Courts Act, 1919: Tramwaymeri&apos;s Court of Inquiry. The first publicsitting of the Court of Inquiry was on the 26th January.* The proceedings were openedby the chairman, who pointed out that the Court was not a court of settlement or decision,but was assembled for the purpose of considering all the facts which may be placed at itsdisposal in order that it might act in an advisory capacity to the Minister of Labour. Aprecedent, which might prove to be of considerable importance, was created by the agree-ment of both sides to admit the representation of the Middle Classes Union on the requestof Captain Gilmour, of that union, that he might be allowed to represent the travellingpublic. Mr. Bevin&apos;s opening speech on behalf of the employees occupied most of thesitting of the 26th January, and a considerable part of that of the 27th.Evidence was given on the 27th January by Mr. S. Hirst, general secretary of the UnitedVehicle Workers; Mr. E. H. Bawden, London district secretary of the same organisation;and by Mr. H. Clay, Leeds organiser to the United Vehicle Workers. The evidence of thefirst two dealt chiefly with conditions of employment; the last-named submitted details bothwith regard to the working of the spread-over and split-duty systems, and also on the questionof the application of municipal tramway reserves to the relief of rates.On the 28th January, Mr. H. Clay concluded his evidence, and personal evidence wasthen submitted in support of the family budgets put in by Mr. Bevin. The employers&apos;representatives, however, stated that they were not prepared to accept or criticise thefigures submitted, but accepted the official Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number.Mr. Bevin took the view that the figures submitted were a challenge to the Labour Gazetteindex number, and then intimated that since the employers&apos; side refused to cross-examine,&quot;he would not call.any more witnesses on family budgets.The Court resumed its sitting on the 2nd February. The most important witnesswas Mr. H. H. Gordon, a member of the London County Council, of the Institution of CivilEngineers and of the Institute of Transport, who was called by Mr. Bevin with the objectof showing that tramways at present are expected to bear unreasonable financial burdens,and that, if these were removed, the tramways would be in a position to meet thedemands of the men. Mr. Gordon criticised the method adopted by many munici-palities in rating the tramway undertakings, and the restrictions on the organisationof the tramway system. Witnesses were then called for the municipal and private under-takings, the first being Mr. J. Beckett, secretary of the Municipal Tramways Association,and joint secretary of the National Joint Council. During his examination there wasfurther discussion concerning the cost-of-living index number, and on the request ofMr. Bevin, the chairman intimated that the Court would represent to the Minister ofLabour that the official responsible for the production of the index number should beasked to give evidence. The examination of Mr. J. Beckett was continued on the 3rdFebruary.On the 4th, Mr. R. A. Smithson, chairman of the Leeds Tramway Committee, andAlderman S. Flint, chairman of the Leicester Corporation Tramways Committee, wereexamined.* The constitution of the Court was given in this Report, Vof. Ill, No, ,4, 22nd January, p. 81.(B 16956T) ... U 2
)Features of the Week-continued.The chairman communicated to the employers&apos; side the desire of the Court for a returnon various points of information, as follows : (1) Route mileage and car-miles rim of undertakings.(2) Number of persons employed, giving grades, in 1914 and 1920.(3) Excess of expenditure over revenue in respect of each undertaking and source from whichexcess was made, 1914 and 1920.(4) Excess of revenue over expenditure and how tlie excess was disposed of.(5) Amount granted by each undertaking on the base rate subsequent to the Industrial CouncilAgreement, 31st March, 1920.(6) Variations, if any, between the wage rates for 1905 and 1914.The Court then adjourned until 15th February in order that these returns might beavailable for the resumed hearing.Trade Boards Acts. A further development of the position of the employers withregard to the application of the Trade Boards Act to the jute and flax spinning industry isnow reported. A communication has been sent by the Dundee Association of Jute Spinnersand Manufacturers to the Minister of Labour requesting that the trade should be withdrawnfrom the operations of the Act, and urging that, owing to the depressed conditionsof the trade, works will have to be closed down indefinitely if the request is not conceded.The severe criticism to which the Trade Boards have been subjected both by employersand by employed has called forth replies from those who believe that their results havebeen beneficial. Mr. J. Hallsworth, joint general secretary of the National Union ofDistributive and Allied Workers, and a member of the Committee of Inquiry into theadministration of the Trade Boards system, which was set up in October, 1920, upholdsthe Trade Boards on the ground that, apart from the Trade Boards and the AgriculturalWages Board, there is no existing machinery for the legal enforcement of wages. Mr. P. C.Hoffman, of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and&quot;Clerks, also defends the Boards on the ground that, at the present time, they are the onlymeans of preventing sweated labour. Many employers have stated that the operationsof the Trade Boards Acts form one of the main causes of unemployment, but Mr. Hoffmanclaims that there is as much unemployment, or even more, in industries which do not comeunder their administration.Cost of Living.-The joint committee to investigate the high cost of living, appointedin June, 1920, by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the LabourParty and the Co-operative Union,* have issued a further interim report, which deals withthe bearing of the question of taxation on the subject of their inquiry. The present systemsof national taxation and expenditure are reviewed; and suggestions are put forwardfor the improvement of the former and the curtailment of the latter. The main pointsof the committee&apos;s proposals are embodied in 16 conclusions which are given, at the end ofthe report. With regard to the present methods of taxation, it is stated that the NationalDebt averaged in 1920 about  170 per head of the population, and that, even in a &quot; normalyear,&quot; a very large proportion of revenue will be devoted to war debt services, and prepara-tion for possible future wars ; it is suggested that, since both prices and the rate of interestwill fall in years to come, this debt will entail an actually increasing real burden on thecommunity, in spite of any reduction which may be made by means of the present SinkingFund. The committee advocate an immediate graduated levy on all forms of accumulatedwealth for the purpose of redeeming  4,000,000,000 of the National Debt, and put forwarddetails of a scheme which they consider could be made to yield this sum. They statethat &quot;we do not think &quot; that this levy would diminish the mobile capital available forinvestment, since wealth would change hands, but its total volume would not be affected.The proceeds of this levy would be devoted primarily to the repayment of the floatingand external debts, which, it is maintained, is the most important item in any programmefor dealing with the cost of living.Other proposals for the revision of existing taxation include the abolition of taxationon foodstuffs and entertainments, and the reduction of the taxation of tobacco by one-half,the amount hitherto obtained by these taxes being secured by the increase of the incometax and super-tax ; the Excess Profits Duty and the proposed tax on business profits arenot approved by the committee, who prefer direct taxation of individuals. Proposalsare put forward for bringing certain sources of income which are at present untappedwithin the scope of the income tax; and it is recommended that death duties should be* See this Report, Vol. II, No, 12,18th September, p. 359.
increased at each successive transference of inherited wealth to the point of ultimateextinction.With regard to the reduction of national expenditure, the proposed capital levywould, it is argued, be the first step towards national economy, in that it would very muchreduce the amount now payable as interest on the National Debt, and the proposal isregarded as the chief practicable method of reducing such expenditure. An internationalagreement for universal disarmament is also advocated, with a view to reducing the costof the fighting forces. The committee consider that retrenchment should be made in theexpenditure on civil departments of the State in accordance with the reports of theCommittee on National Expenditure, but they deplore any attempt to save taxes at theexpense of efficiency in the Civil Service, which they consider is likely to become more,and not less, important in the future ; and they are most strongly opposed to any curtail-ment of expenditure on education, housing, or the public health.The report concludes with remarks on the questions of key industries, dumping,recent increases of local taxation and the desirability of equalising this burden betweenarea and area ; these remarks follow the general lines of the Labour Party&apos;s policy on thesequestions.National Federation of Building Trades Employers. At the annual meeting of thisFederation, held on the 26th January, various problems which have arisen in connectionwith the building industry were discussed. Disappointment was expressed at the work doneby the Joint Industrial Council for the industry. It was stated that the report of theManagement and Costs Committee on suggested lines of reorganisation in the industry hasaroused much opposition from the employers in all parts of the country, and that the rankand file of the employers feel that their position may be undermined unless a strong protestis made. The following resolution was passed : &quot; That consideration be given to the issueof the usefulness or otherwise of the Industrial Council, and the subject be referred to theAdministrative Committee for consideration and report.&quot;The wages problem was also considered ; and the opinion was put forward that if theoperatives desire increased earnings, wages must be related to results. The claim whichthe building guilds are now making that their men are laying as many as 750 bricks a day,was taken as a proof that output has been restricted. A resolution was carried protestingagainst H.M. Office of Works undertaking any contracts in regard to building schemes,and binding the Federation to take steps, through Parliament or otherwise, to ascertain thecost of building on those schemes which the Office of Works already have in hand.It was also stated that there is some prospect of a settlement of the differences betweenmaster builders and master plumbers which have been particularly acute in Lancashireand the Midlands. Conferences have been arranged, and representatives of the variousfederations are meeting to see if some basis of agreement can be found.Unemployment.Relief of Unemployment. The position with regard to unemployment remains aboutthe same. The terms of reference of the Unemployment Grants Committee under thechairmanship of Lord St. Davids have now been extended in three directions. The Com-mittee are enabled to make grants in respect of the maintenance and construction of roadsother than roads coming within the scheme of the Ministry of Transport, notwithstandingthat the expenditure on labour may be less than 50 per cent, of the total; they, maymake grants not exceeding 60 per cent, of the wages bill for additional men engaged; andgrants are now permitted to be made through local authorities to a distress committeeor voluntary agency, provided that the scheme, in respect of which a grant is given, hasbeen definitely recommended by the local authority, and that the authority makethemselves responsible for the observance of the conditions laid down by the Committee. Itis reported that about  250,000 has been expended out of the fund of  3,000,000 allocated tothe Committee, and employment provided for about 7,700 men. The number of schemesin respect of which grants have been made is about 150, and include schemes for roadmaking and repairing, for the laying of water and gas pipes, the extension and repairof cemeteries, and other undertakings. A certain number of applications for grants havehad to be refused, either because the Ministry of Labour have been unable to certify thatserious unemployment exists in the district concerned, or because the works were begun orconcluded before the date on which the Committee was constituted. Every effort is beingmade to expedite the bestowal of grants, applications being dealt with as soon as they arereceived.
The reference to the unions affiliated to the National Federation of Building TradesOperatives of the question of the acceptance or rejection of the Governmentfs offer in connec-tion with the proposal to absorb 50,000 ex-Service men into the building industry has resultedin a decisive vote against the offer. In a letter to the Minister, announcing the result of theballot, Mr. R. Coppock, general secretary to the Federation, states that the Federationdesire to reiterate the opinion that, &quot; with proper organisation, there is, and has been, anample supply of labour to meet all requirements &quot; in the industry. Also, in view of thefact that a large number of building trades operatives are&apos;at present unemployed, no usefulpurpose would be served by drafting into the industry another set of men. The operativesalso appear to have been influenced by a statement alleged to have been made by theRegistrar-General to the effect that the national housing demand could be met by theconstruction of not more than 140,000 houses. This has increased the fear of futureunemployment, so that not even the attraction of the guaranteed rate of pay onhousing operations for wet time &quot; offered by the Government prevailed against the beliefthat the situation would be imperilled by acceptance of the proposals. The Minister,addressing a conference on unemployment which was held at Bedford on the 4th February,referred to the position created by the refusal of the operatives to accept the Governmentsproposals, and urged that the key to the situation was the extension of building operations,as this would enhance the opportunities for employment in other trades.A claim for an extension of benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, wasmade by a deputation of women workers who were received by the Minister on the 8thFebruary. The deputation were introduced by Miss Bondfield, who informed the Ministerthat the period for receiving benefit under the Act would come to an end for many women,on the 12th February, and that their position was very serious. The Minister stated inreply that the situation which would arise when the ex-Service men would have exhaustedtheir right to out-of-work donation, and when insured persons had exhausted their 8 weeks&apos;benefit under the Act, had been engaging his closest consideration, and that the Govern-menfs decision would be announced as early as possible^A representative conference on unemployment among women in Scotland washeld on the 1st February in Glasgow under the auspices of the Scottish Council of Women&apos;sTrades. Delegates from various women&apos;s societies attended, as well as members of the Glas-gow Corporation. Miss Irwin, the general secretary of the Council, presented a statementdealing with the position, and this was discussed by the meeting. At the close, a resolutionwas adopted protesting against the exclusion of women members from the various deputa-tions connected with unemployment, and especially from Government committees dealingwith the question. The Unemployment Committee of the National Alliance of Employersand Employed have also held a meeting during the week, to receive a report upon theincrease of unemployment and under-employment. At this meeting a special committeewas appointed to deal with the question of unemployment in agriculture, which, it is believed,may become very serious this year.Short Time : Railways. The problem of unemployment and short-time working onrailways was discussed at a conference of the Executive Council of the National Union ofRailwaymen and the Standing Committee of General Managers on the 3rd February.As a result, a resolution was passed by the Executive Council that the union adhere rigidlyto the principle of the guaranteed week, but do not prohibit members from choosing towork part-time in order to prevent unemployment.At a further conference of the Standing Committee of Railway Managers and theExecutive Council, held on the 7th February, the union urged the abolition of all overtimeand tonnage and bonus working. The managers, while prepared to agree to the eliminationof overtime as far as possible, contended that, if tonnage and bonus working were abolished,it would lead to congestion of traffic, and create further unemployment. On the out-standing question of the.guaranteed week, it is anticipated that an agreement will be arrivedat shortly.Trade Union Topics.Organisation of Piecers in the Cotton Spinning Trade. Efforts are now being made toorganise piecers in the cotton spinning trade. The position, at the moment, so far as theoperative spinners and piecers are concerned, is that some piecers have been membersof the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners for a long
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 25., 18th December, p. 680.time, but they are a very small percentage of the total number of piecers employed. Anypiecer who is a member of the association receives pay for temporary stoppages, strikesor lock-outs, and ,the association take up any piecer&apos;s compensation cases or other caseswhich appear before the Court. The piecers have no voting powers, nor do they receiveunemployment benefit at the present time. Under the Unemployment Insurance Act,1920, the piecers who are members of the association will come in on a correspondingbasis to the spinners. A small body of piecers have raised the question of a voice in theassociation^ counsels, and have asked for an extension and revision of the system of voting.The Workers&apos; Union are also endeavouring to absorb the piecers. They have begunpropaganda work in the Oldham district, and, so far, claim that their efforts have beenvery successful.National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers. It is reported that the Parlia-mentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress have consented to the admission tomembership of the Congress of this body, which is the newly constituted amalgamation ofthe National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union and the Amalgamated Union ofCo-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers. It will be rememberedthat the fact that the co-operative workers&apos; union were not admitted to membership of theTrades Union Congress was the main obstacle which prevented the National AmalgamatedUnion of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks joining the new combination.Union of Post Office Workers. At a general meeting, on the 2nd February, of theMetropolitan Districts branch of the union, consisting of counter, telegraph and telephoneemployees, a resolution was passed that &quot; the conference, realising that the union had tochoose between the abandonment of the strike policy * and the loss of 40,000 or more workers,decides that it could not afford the latter alternative.&quot; It was also resolved that in theinterests of the union as a whole, and in view of the great opposition to the strike policyand fund on the part of large numbers of the members, the branch should demand thesuspension of those items at the earliest possible date.Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers.-At a meeting of representatives of theAmalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers, the ScottishUnion of Bakers and Confectioners, and the Irish Bakers&apos; National Amalgamated Union,held on the 17th January at Liverpool, a scheme was discussed for the amalgamationof these unions into one federation, the federation of&apos; the Operative Bakers and Con-fectioners of Great Britain and Ireland. The chief objects of the new federation, asstated, are to secure the abolition of night baking by legal enactment; to give mutualassistance to each of the component bodies in case of industrial disputes ; and to promoteuniformity of conditions of labour for all members of the federation. A constitutionwas drafted which is to be considered at the annual conference of each of the unions con-cerned. It was decided that a provisional committee should be set up, consisting of twodelegates from each union, with Mr. W. Banfleld, general secretary of the AmalgamatedUnion of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers, as acting secretary. If thescheme is adopted at the annual conferences of the unions, the provisional committee willarrange for an inaugural meeting of the federation, to be held in October, 1921.Monmouthshire and South Wales Colliery Enginemen, Stokers and Craftsmen^ Association. With reference to the amalgamation of this association with the South Wales Miners&apos;Federation, recorded in last week&apos;s issue of this Report, it may be noted that enginemen,stokers and craftsmen employed at the collieries in the Forest of Dean were, until theamalgamation on the 29th January, members of the association. They are, therefore, notincluded in the amalgamation scheme, and are to be compensated out of the existingfunds of the former association. These men have not yet decided what is to be donewith regard to their trade union membership, but it is probable that they will affiliate withthe Forest of Dean Miners&apos; Association.It is regretted that, in last week&apos;s issue of the Report, the number of votesagainst amalgamation was incorrectly given as 73,738, the correct number being 7,373.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTESDemands and Negotiations.Building Trades Operatives (National). The proposal, already noted in this Keport, forthe stabilisation of wages in the building industry was considered at the annual meetingof the National Federation of Building Trades Employers on the 26th January, who decidedthat they could not agree to this, &quot; there being very sound reason that this course wouldbe opposed as a whole, and quite in opposition to the present and future economic conditionsof the country.&quot;Railway Shopmen (National). Negotiations with the Negotiating Committee ofEailway Managers with regard to the shopmen&apos;s programme are still delayed by thedispute between the National Union of Railwaymen and the Amalgamated EngineeringUnion. The joint conferences of the executives of the two organisations, which began onthe 25th January, concluded on the 1st February without finding a satisfactory basis ofagreement. The Special General Meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen met inLondon on the 3rd February to receive a report from their executive. This body appointeda deputation who interviewed the executive of the Amalgamated Engineering Union lateon the 3rd February and elicited further proposals for an accommodation. On the 4th,the adjourned Special General Meeting, finding that the proposals obtained from theAmalgamated Engineering Union were unacceptable, submitted a suggestion for thereference of the issue &quot; to arbitration by some impartial person within the Labour ranks.&quot;The position now is that, on the 5th, the executive of the Amalgamated Engineering Uniondecided that they could not accept the proposal for a reference of the dispute to arbitrationwithout previous consultation with all the interests concerned. In effect, this impliesa threat on the part of the Amalgamated Engineering Union to rally all craft unions to theirsupport, in order to maintain the exclusive right of such unions to represent and negotiatefor skilled engineers in railway workshops a right which is regarded as challenged bythe industrial policy of the National Union of Railwaymen. Reference was made last weekto a similar dispute between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Miners&apos; Federa-tion ; but, apparently, the Amalgamated Union regard the position with regard to railwayshops as essentially different. Much depends upon the amount of support which theFederation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades are ready to afford.&apos; A joint con-ference was held between the executive of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and therepresentatives of the Federation at York on the 9th February, but no report of anythingdecisive is yet to hand.Shale Oil Miners (Scotland). Scottish Oils, Ltd., have given notice to the ScottishShale Miners&apos; Association for a reduction in wages by 2s. a day, and the discontinuance ofthe supply of household coal at a special rate similar to that allowed to coal miners. Forsome time past, shale miners&apos; wages have been regulated on the same basis as those, of coalminers, and every advance given to the coal miners has been followed by a similar advanceto the shale miners, with the exception of the Is. Qd. a day which accrued to the coal minersduring the month of January under the terms of the settlement of November last. TheAssociation have recommended their members not to accept the proposal of Scottish Oils,Ltd., with reference to the reduction of wages, if the coal miners&apos; wages are not reducedby the end of February, and have also advised members to resist the decision with referenceto the supply of household coal. Application is being made to Scottish Oils, Ltd., to submita working scheme whereby shale miners&apos; wages might for the future be regulated partlyaccording to the prosperity of the oil industry, and partly in relation to coal miners&apos; wages.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial RelationsDepartment&apos;s seetion of the Report, pages 157 to 161.]
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Shipbuilders (National). A letter lias been addressed to the Minister by the secretary- of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades intimating that, at a meetingof the shipyard trade unions, held on the 4th February, to consider the refusal of theShipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation to concede a general wages application made inOctober last, the unions were definitely of opinion that the position of the industry did notwarrant this attitude, that it was unanimously decided that the matter ought to be referredfor inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act, and that a deputation was appointed to meetthe Minister at an early date with a view to making preliminary arrangements andsubmitting terms of reference.Optical Instruments-On the 31st January, officers of the department interviewed thechairman of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, to discuss the futureof the Committee in view of the fact that the Amalgamated Engineering Union are con-sidering whether they shall remain members or not. He thought that unless the unionradically altered their present attitude to Whitley Councils generally, there would be littleuse in the Committee meeting further.  The next meeting has been postponed indefinitely.BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Building Trades Operatives (Bridport). The meeting of the employers concerned inthe dispute reported last week was held on the 25th January, when it was made quiteclear that if the South-Western Federation, to whom they are affiliated, agreed that GradeIV rates should be paid in Bridport, they would withdraw from the Federation and settleany further wages disputes direct with their employees. The Chief Conciliation Officer,who attended the meeting, was given to understand that the pre-war rate was 5d. to 5ld.an hour, and he was unable to prevail upon the employers to agree to a joint conference.He was, however, able to persuade the operatives&apos; strike committee to recommend a with-drawal of notices, and he expects that their recommendation will be followed.Building Trade Operatives (Bideford). On the 5th January, about 150 men struckfor an advance in wages of 1 \d. per hour to bring their rates up to the Grade IV rates underthe South-Western scheme. The employers are not parties to the scheme, and have refusedto agree with the Chief Conciliation Officers proposal that they should meet the operativesto discuss the matter. The Mayor of Bideford has informed the Chief Conciliation Officerthat he proposes to discuss the question with both parties.Imported Joinery. Sir David Shackleton had an interview with representatives ofthe Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, in regard to this question on the 4thFebruary. They said that a sub-committee of their executive council had discussed thematter with a representative of the Swedish manufacturers, and it was proposed to recom-mend the council to send a representative to Sweden to go into the whole question withthe Swedish trade unions. It was common knowledge that the society had taken up aposition of determined opposition to piece-work, but, if the Swedish unions were preparedto authorise this system, although the society reserved their right to freedom of action,they did not see how in practice they could object to the fixing of Swedish joinery madeunder conditions recognised as fair by unions in that country. Any instructions so farissued to their members not to fix Swedish joinery were based on the ground that it hadbeen made in shops notified to them by the Swedish unions as not complying with localworking conditions.QUARRYING.Cement. On the 6th January, the Industrial Council considered an applicationfrom the South-Eastern District Council for a ruling on Clause 3 of the wages agreementof the 27th May, 1920, which provides for a 10s. advance for time-workers, to be calculated
for piece-workers on the existing basis. It was contended that the clause was meant togive a piece-worker 10s. per week advance, irrespective of tonnage basis, provided that&apos; 48 hours per week are worked. The Council decided that the 10s. advance was onlypayable to a piece-worker, as and when he had earned this sum under the conditions thathad hitherto governed his earnings. It was suggested, in this connection, that instructionsshould be sent to all District Councils that altered conditions of working should be investi-gated by one representative from each side of the District Council concerned. An applica-tion by the Eastern District Council for power to adjust rates within their area, exceptin so far as general increases were concerned, was refused by the National Council. TheCouncil decided to extend the area of the Hull District Council in order to include threeworks in that neighbourhood.TRANSPORT.Road Transport (London). Arising out of the agreement in December last, by whichthe men employed in the road transport industry in the London area were to receive anadvance of 4s. per week from the 11th December, the National Union of Vehicle Workershave requested assistance in a dispute arising from the refusal of the Metropolitan andHome Counties Road Transport Contractors&apos; Association to concede a similar advanceto carters employed by their members. A meeting of the parties, under the chairmanshipof an officer of the department, took place at headquarters on the 2nd February, but noagreement was reached. Formal application has been received from the union for thereference of their claim to the Industrial Court, and the employers have been asked for theirconcurrence.Carters (Macclesfield). The Industrial Court decided that the rate for drivers of one-horse vehicles should be increased by 5s. per week, and that of drivers of two-horse vehicles,if and when employed, by 2s. per week above that of drivers of one-horse vehicles. Withregard to the applications for alterations in working conditions, it was held that the claimshad not been established.  (Award No. 611.)Porters (Covent Garden). Negotiations, mainly in connection with the question ofporterage rates, have been proceeding with difficulty since September, 1920. The delayhas been to a great extent due to the antagonism between the National Union of GeneralWorkers and the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union. The Chief Con-ciliation Officer has been asked to assist, and has now arranged a joint conference for the9th February, which all parties have agreed to attend.CHEMICALS AND EXPLOSIVES.Soap and Candles. The employers&apos; federation having announced their decision toretire from the Joint Industrial Council forthwith, and to give three months&apos; notice oftermination of the agreement fixing the conditions upon which wages questions could beconsidered, a meeting of the Council was called, at the request of the workers&apos; side,on the 3rd February. The discussion of the employers&apos; decision was marked by good temperon both sides. Dr. Armstrong, the employers&apos; principal speaker, complained that theCouncil had been occupied with wages question only, and had hampered, instead of helped,the industry. Alderman Robinson and Mr. Kelly, for the workers&apos; side, asserted thatthese wages questions would have to be considered in any event, and, on the whole, itwas good for the industry that they should have been considered in the Council rather thanoutside it. They too would welcome the consideration of non-wages questions, butthought it the duty of the employers, even more than of the workers, to put such questionsupon the agenda. Eventually the employers intimated that they would not withdrawforthwith, but would give three months&apos; notice of their intention to do so, and would discussthe matter again at a further meeting of the Council on the 3rd March. In the meantimeDr. Armstrong and Alderman Robinson, the two chairmen, are to meet.TEXTILES.Hosiery. An emergency meeting of the Joint Industrial Council is to be held on the15th February, at which will be considered the special unemployment insurance schemeand a request that the suggested reduction of bonus should come into operation im-mediately. The Council on the 13th January decided that consideration of the questionof reducing the present bonus should be deferred for three months.
547Wool Textile Industry (Bradford). Arising out of a dispute between Messrs. Priestly,Ltd., Bradford, and the General Union of Textile Workers, over the employment of fournon-union weavers, the firm gave notice that, if there were a repetition of the disorderwhich had occurred on two previous occasions, the mills would be closed indefinitely.On the 6th January the disorder became serious, and the mills were closed. On the 14thJanuary the firm informed the secretary of the union that the works would be re-openedon condition that union and non-union labour worked amicably together, that the practiceof collecting union subscriptions during shop hours ceased, and that eight operatives, whowere regarded by the firm as the sole cause of the trouble which has existed on this questionsince 1919, were not re-engaged. The intervention of the department has been sought,and the Chief Conciliation Officer has arranged to interview the firm with a view to a jointconference.LEATHER AND BOOTS AND SHOES.Leather Manufacture (Irthlingborough). A joint conference between representativesof Messrs. Hatton, Shaw &amp; Co., and their employees was held on the 4th February, to whicha Conciliation Officer was invited. The workers were prepared to agree to the reductionof the wages of unskilled day-workers from Is. %\d. to Is. per hour, and they also suggestedthat the women&apos;s day-work rate should remain unchanged. The firm were unable toagree to any modification of their proposals, and the meeting was adjourned till the evening,when the representatives of the firm and of the Ministry attended a mass meeting of theworkers, at which it was ultimately decided that the firm&apos;s books should be investigatedby a chartered accountant appointed by the union, and that the union should then submitto the firm their opinion upon the proposed reduction of rates.MINING.China Clay. The Industrial Council met on the 27th January, when agreement wasreached on the Workers&apos; Union&apos;s proposals and the employers&apos; counter-proposals in regardto wages.  Details will be made public when the agreement has been signed.Lead: Proposed Reduction of Wages. On the 31st January, the Chief Labour Adviserinterviewed Mr. Murray, of the Wanlockhead Mining Company, and Mr. Felix Wilson,of the Leadhills Company, and urged the desirability of arbitration. They stated thatthe position was much too critical, but that the companies might be willing to allow anindependent person nominated by the Ministry to report upon the financial position;and they agreed to recommend to a meeting of directors, on the 2nd February, that aconference with the union should be held to consider this proposal. Apparently this sugges-tion was rejected, as the Ministry were informed that the directors would be willing toattend a conference with representatives of their own workers presided over by arepresentative of the Ministry, without interference from the Miners&apos; Federation.Mr. McKerrell is meeting representatives of the directors to discuss this last proposal,andi if possible, to secure a further joint conference of the union and the directors.Tin.--The Industrial Council met on the 28th January, when the counter-proposalsof the workers&apos; side to the mine-owners&apos; suggestions for a reduction of 10 per cent, in wageswere considered. It was decided that the union officials should meet the managementsof the four mines now working, and negotiate with them individually. A. meeting tookplace at the East Pool Mine on the following day, when a reduction of 10 per cent, wasagreed on, and meetings will shortly be held at South Crofty and Treasvean. It appearsprobable, however, that unless the price of tin rises the mines will stop all operations otherthan pumping.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Supply. A conference of representatives of the outstanding undertakingsin the North-East Coast and the Yorkshire areas, and of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos;Association, was held at Leeds on the 3rd February to consider the difference in regardto the schedule of salaries and conditions of employment recommended by the NationalJoint Board of Employers and Staff Members. The association^ representatives agreedthat action should again be suspended, until the 17th February, to enable the undertakingsto agree to adopt the schedule and conditions, subject to the reference of any anomaliesor difficulties of interpretation to the District Joint Boards for their respective areas.The Gloucester Corporation have declined to accept the recommendation of theirrepresentatives who attended the joint conference with representatives of the Electrical
Power Engineers&apos; Association at Gloucester on the 28th January. The association haverecommended their local members not to cease work pending negotiations by the depart-ment, who are arranging for a further conference at an early date.The difference between the Wolverhampton Corporation and the Association has beensettled, the Corporation having decided, on the 1st February, to adopt the schedule ofsalaries recommended by the National Joint Board.The District Joint Industrial Council for the South Coast Area met on the 31st January.Several undertakings presented financial statements showing their inability to pay the ratesrecommended by the Provincial Council. It was decided that their balance-sheets shouldbe considered by a sub-committee, and that copies should be circulated to all membersof the Council.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales). A meeting of the executive committee of the Provincial Council for the Southern HomeCounties was held on the 4th February. Agreements were reached on proposals for gradingvarious classes of employees. The committee discussed whether the Council shoulddecide to deal with the conditions of employment of all permanent manual employeesin the non-trading services, disregarding craft union agreements, and a further meetingis to be held to discuss this subject.The executive committee of the District Council for the South Midlands area met onthe 4th February. A draft works committee constitution was considered, and also mattersarising out of the failure of certain authorities to put into operation some of the provisionsof the wages agreement of the 3rd December.A meeting of the Provincial Council for Yorkshire (North and East Ridings), adjournedfrom the 9th December, was held on the 3rd February. During the adjournment the localauthorities in the area had been asked to intimate whether they were prepared to supportthe Council during the ensuing year or not. Six local authorities only were in favourof the continued existence of the Council. After discussion, in which both sides expressedregret at this lack of support, it was unanimously resolved to adjourn sine die.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Shop Assistants (London). The union have now officially informed the departmentthat they have reached a deadlock with the chief London firms on the application ofAward No. 594. The National Union of Vehicle Workers and the United Vehicle Workershave formed a joint committee with the shop assistants with a view to bringing abouta settlement. The department are in communication with the Incorporated Associationof Retail Distributors, to which all the firms in question are affiliated.Warehousemen (Liverpool). The secretary of the National Joint Council for DockLabour was interviewed at headquarters on the 4th February, in connection with theproposed reduction of wages. A letter was subsequently sent to the United TradesAssociation of Liverpool informing them that, in the Ministers view, it would be advisable,as a first step, for their Association to discuss fqrmally the questions at issue with theNational Council for Dock Labour. The Chief Conciliation Officer reports that somefirms have given their employees notice of a reduction in wages, and that the dockers&apos;union have issued strike notices in respect of these firms, to take effect as from the 11thor 12th February.Co-operative Wholesale Society : Wages Negotiations. In December, 1919, the Amal-gamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers putforward a demand for a new scale of wages and improved conditions, on behalf of theirmembers employed in the various depots and warehouses of the Co-operative WholesaleSociety, who were not covered by Industrial Council Agreements or National Awards.After protracted negotiations, agreements were reached by which the Society undertookto introduce a classification of the various grades of workers in two schedules, each groupto receive the new grade scale of wages, with back pay to the 1st April, 1920. Theemployees were dissatisfied with the progress ef the negotiations, and a conference of theirrepresentatives, at Manchester on the 12th December, resolved to inform the Board that,if the new classification and rates of wages were not produced before the 31st December,steps w^uld be taken.Early in January, 1921, the union requested the departments intervention, andindicated that they were prepared to take drastic action. Representatives of both sideshave been interviewed at headquarters. The union alleged delay on the part of the Societyin carrying the agreements into effect.   The representatives of the Society contended that
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Dressmaking and Women&apos;s Light Clothing Trade Board (Scotland). The SpecialCommittee agreed to recommend a revised scale of minimum rates of wages for learnersin the retail branch, and to amplify the definition of a learner, and further to recommenda variation of the general minimum time-rates for female workers, of specified experience andability, employed in the retail branch of the trade in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh andGlasgow.Grocery and Provisions Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board considered theobjections received to the Notices of the 3rd and 16th November, and resolved to fixgeneral minimum time-rates for male and female workers employed as porters, and shopassistants, of the age of 16 years and upwards, and to suggest the 21st March as the datefrom which the rates should become effective. The Board further resolved to extend thearea to which Scale A shall apply, so as to include, in addition to all areas administered byrural district councils, all areas administered by municipal borough councils and urbandistrict councils, which, according to the most recent census, have a population of lessthan 10,000. The basis of the weekly wage was fixed as set out in the Notices of Proposal.the agreements had been extended to many whom, in the first instance, they were notintended to cover, and that it necessarily took a considerable time to examine the claimsof all who might be affected.  They agreed, however, to speed the work up.Negotiations between the parties are still proceeding, but the union intimated at afurther interview on the 5th January that a meeting of their executive committee, arrangedfor the 6th February, might decide upon a strike policy.GENERAL.Hours of Employment Bill. In view of the prospective compulsory attendance ofjuvenile workers under 16 years of age at day continuation classes for a period of eighthours a week, the London (Central) Advisory Committee for Juvenile Employment sentthe following resolution to the Minister : &quot; That this Committee has heard with considerable concern that the hours of compulsory con-tinued education are not taken into account in the hours of employment of juveniles under the termsof the Hours of Employment (No. 2) Bill. The Committee asks that steps be taken immediatelyto rectify this omission, which makes possible the employment of young persons for eight hours aweek in excess of the time proposed for adults.&quot;After consultation with the Home Office, it is proposed to inform the committee thatthe Minister does not consider the Hours of Employment Bill a suitable instrument for theregulations of hours of young persons, apart froni the normal hours applicable to theindustries in which they are engaged; that Section 10 (6) of the Education Act, 1918,gives power to the local education authority to require that the employment of any youngperson attending a continuation school should be suspended during the period of attendanceat school, and &quot; for such other specified part of the day, not exceeding two hours, as theauthority consider necessary in order to secure that he may be in a fit mental and bodilycondition to receive full benefit from attendance at school.&quot; It appears therefore to theMinister that it would be premature to ask Parliament to review the decision taken in1918 before the sufficiency of the power in question has been tested by experience. Shouldexperience show that some amendment is required, it should presumably be effected byan amendment of the Education Act, 1918.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be^foundalso on pages 150 to 155, and 162.]
General Department-continued.Milk Distributive Trade Board (England and Wales). The Administrative Committeeconsidered a letter and memorandum from the Ministry in reference to the scope of theBoard in relation to that of the Agricultural Wages Board, and resolved that before express-ing any opinion, to confer with the Administrative Committee of the Agricultural WagesBoard.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board (Great Britain).

Reports indicate a further decline in industrial activity, andwhile, at present, this appears to be met by increased short-time working, apprehensionis felt that the continued absence of orders must inevitably result in further restrictionseven on short-time working. In the cotton industry, for example, many firms are findingit necessary to make longer stoppages. On the other hand the improvement in the bootand shoe industry appears to be maintained, particularly among those firms engaged in amedium class trade. The improvement reported in the lace trade is also continuing, ifsomewhat slowly. No change is to be recorded in the position of the woollen textileand hosiery trades. The position of the jute trade appears to be firmer. There is atendency on the part of spinners to maintain that, owing to the loss in spinning, pricescannot be further reduced, and this, it is considered, will have the effect of steadyingthe market.In the Metropolitan area there is acute depression in all trades and further largeincreases in the live registers are again reported.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. On the Clyde the shipyard joiners&apos; strike isadversely affecting the employment of other classes of skilled tradesmen. No improvementcan be looked for, pending a settlement of the dispute. Reports from the Tyne, the Teesand the Wear indicate that unemployment is increasing rapidly. In the South Walesdistrict the improvement reported at Barry and Newport still holds good, and severalship-repairing1 firms have commenced new contracts, but the expected improvementat Swansea referred to last week has not materialised. Ship-repair work at Avonmouthhas improved considerably as the result of the arrival of several tank steamers for repair.On the Mersey the position is said to be slowly improving, but high prices are still anadverse factor.Although the prices of pig-iron and manufactured iron and steel have fallen, un-employment is still on the increase in the iron and steel and engineering trades.Building. The London (Central) Exchange for the Building Trades report that theslight improvement referred to last week is maintained, but the effect is at present verylimited, and applies principally to decorating work. The general outlook for the momentis uncertain owing to the unsettled labour conditions.Industrial Developments. Hendon report that Messrs. Waygood Otis, Ltd., are takingover a portion of the works of Messrs. G-rahame White &amp; Co., Ltd. At Yeovil there isconsiderable activity in the flax factories, as large orders have been received from theUnited States.Bromley report that a  50,000 contract for a new reservoir for the Metropolitan WaterBoard is about to be commenced.
Labour Reductions. In addition to the difficulties mentioned above, Plymouth reportthat Messrs. Allen &amp; Sons, Ivybridge, paper manufacturers, are closing down, and 140 menand women will be affected. At Flint 120 workpeople have been thrown out of employmentat the works of the North Wales Paper Co.Stamford report the suspension of several masons owing to difficulty in obtainingsupplies of stone.Transport. Bargoed report that the Tincoed Collieries are idle owing to a shortageof wagons, and Wick again refer to the difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of trucksfor the disposal of the fish landed by trawlers.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation. Both unemployment and under-employment, according toavailable statistics, appear still to be sharply on the increase.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that depression in the cottonindustry continues, and is responsible for the abnormal amount of unemployment andunder-employment among women throughout the division. Several Exchanges in thetextile areas nevertheless speak of possible improvement in the near future. Accringtonreport that there is no immediate improvement but that there are hopes that the worststage is over. Chorley consider that there is a promise of revival in trade in the textileindustry, and at Heywood it is thought the return to better conditions is not far distant.Other trades in the division continue severely depressed, including the rubber, clothing,hatting, cable and glass bottle industries.Little change is reported from the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division. Largenumbers of workers are still reported to be on short time and many are entirely unemployedin the textile centres. At Bradford, for example, in mid-January it was reported that thenumber of claimants exceeded 8,000. At Morley there are 3,000 women on the live register,the majority being textile operatives. At Sowerby Bridge there are over 2,000 short-timeworkers, mainly cotton and woollen operatives, but the number of totally unemployedwomen is comparatively small. At Batley woollen workers, shoddy workers and ragsorters are on short time, about 100 firms being involved. At Brighouse, also, short timeis general.There is still acute depression in the lace industry at Basford, Beeston, Long Eatonand Nottingham, although at Basford a number of women have resumed full-time workin hosiery, lace and blouse making. At Nottingham, also, a slight improvement in the blousemaking trade is noted, but the hosiery industry is not expected to improve until June.Both at Todmorden and Hebden Bridge depression in the cotton trade appears to bemore acute. The clothing trades throughout the division are depressed, and at Leeds,where wholesale clothing is the staple industry, the live register is now over 9,000, inaddition to over 1,000 short-time workers.In the South Midlands and Eastern Division the staple industries continue to showdepression. Many fish workers are unemployed at Lowestoft, and the Hoffman Manu-facturing Co., Ltd., engineers, are continuing to discharge women workers at Chelmsford.The position in the London and South-Eastern Division seems taking much the samecourse as for some weeks past, unemployment in the factory areas being still on the increase.At Bermondsey, the live register is nearly 3,000, in addition to over 1,600 short-timeworkers. At the Borough there is also an increase in the live register. At East Ham,where the clothing and rubber trades are depressed, the live register is over 1,300 ; atboth Tottenham and Holloway there are over 2,000 live unemployment insurance claims,and at Walhahi Green the live register is over 1,000. The Great Marlborough StreetExchange, however, report that a revival in the dressmaking and allied trades is progressingsteadily.Unemployment in the West Midlands Division is increasing. Birmingham reportfurther large increases in the live register, which on the 21st January stood at nearly 9,000.At Coventry the live register is over 1,700. All the staple industries are seriously depressed.At Selly Oak, Messrs. Cadbury Bros., Bournville, have commenced systematic short time.There appears to be considerable short time in the pottery trade, and activity in thisindustry has decreased during the past few weeks in all the main centres. At Stoke-on-Trent the principal firms state that they expect to be able to find work for at least fourdays a week.
550165  &apos; 12.2.21.In Wales there is a certain amount of unemployment in the tinplate trades and in theclothing trades. Generally speaking, however, unemployment is not so serious as in otherareas.In the South-Western Division the staple industries all remain depressed. At Bristoland Gloucester the unemployment previously reported remains serious. Yeovil state thatthere are approximately 5,000 outworkers unemployed in the glove industry, in additionto an increase of unemployment amongst the factory workers.In the Northern Division trade depression continues among dressmakers, weavers,underclothing workers, tailoresses and ropery workers.The general depression previously reported in the staple industries in Scotland con-tinues. At Aberdeen the live register is over 900, in addition to 1,500 short-time workers.The trades affected are stationery, paper, linen, jute and hosiery. Calico printing is slackat Airdrie and Alexandria and the linen industry is severely depressed in Dunfermline.Hosiery work is slack in Alexandria, Annan, Hamilton and Kilmarnock. At Paisley andother textile centres considerable depression is reported. Heavy registers are again reportedfrom all the Glasgow Exchanges. j LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.       [Lu&amp;BMJj^SEmployment and Resettlement. Continued activity is being displayed by committeesin approaching the various local authorities in connection with relief schemes. Perth,Kirkcaldy and Greenock are among those who have reported satisfactory results. Dart-ford and Erith are concerned at the rate of wages being paid to the workpeople, and theyare approaching the Kent County Council to pay trade union rates for this work. In themeantime, the Dartford Committee have instructed the manager of the Exchange not tosubmit applicants while the present low rates of wages are offered. It&apos;would-appear thaton a similar undertaking at Ramsgate the men receive the district rate. The committeewish to know who is responsible for what they term &quot; a flagrant case of exploitation ofex-Service men.&quot;Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Insurance. The Taunton Exchange Sub-Committee express the opinion that all insured persons should be able to claim a refund ofcontributions paid under the Unemployment Insurance Act when they became apparentlyincapable of work after paying contributions for 5 years. They also recommend a refundon a similar basis to the next-of-kin of deceased insured persons. Recommendations havebeen received from several committees, that the rule, under which no more than 90 daysbenefit may be drawn during any one year, should be disregarded during the present crisis.Training of War Widows. The Rotherham Women&apos;s Sub-Committee propose cir-culating a resolution to all committees, requesting the Minister to extend the period withinwhich applications for training may be made, in order that war widows who failed to applywithin one year from the death of their husbands may be eligible for training.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to informationreceived at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 27th January,show 304,560 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  283,135 7s. id.Unemployment Insurance. The number of payments of unemployment insurancebenefit during the week ending the 21st January was 661,737, involving an amount of 376,041 3s. U.JUVENILE BRANCH.School Conferences. The Hastings and Bexhill Juvenile Advisory Committee havedecided to suspend during the Easter term the conferences held at schools to advise school-leaving children about employment. They consider that these conferences at the presenttime give a false impression that employment is available. The committee are sendingout a letter to the parents of children due to leave school at Easter, advising them to keeptheir children at school until there is a definite offer of employment^School Exemptions. As a result of representations made to the education authorityby the Dundee Juvenile Advisory Committee, all school exemptions are to be suspendedexcept in very exceptional circumstances. On the 10th January, 180 applications whichcame before the authority were refused.

The Appointments Departmenthave dealt with a total of 1,021 cases, in 466 of which the training sanctioned is providedby the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments.Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 270 cases, andabandoned training in 45 ; 135 are still in training, and 16 are awaiting training.Apprenticeship in Fishing (Scarborough). At a recent meeting of the Juvenile Employ -ment Committee it was stated that the Scarborough Fishing Vessel Owners&apos; Associationhad passed the following resolutions governing the employment of boys on fishing vessels.That owners be permitted to take one apprentice on each vessel for one year, at a ware of 10.s.per week with food and clothing.That preference be given to boys from the Sea Scouts&apos; School, and that no other boys be engagedas apprentices so long as boys from that school are available.That owners undertake to sign on boys after the completion of their apprenticeship, providedthey are found fully qualified to serve as members of the crew.The Juvenile Employment Committee, while regarding these arrangements as a usefulstep towards the establishment of a regular apprenticeship scheme in the industry,decided to suggest, for the consideration of the owners&apos; association, that when not at sea,the boys should continue to attend the Sea Training School for technical training, andthat wages should be paid when boys were not at sea.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will alsobe found on pages 150, 154, 161, 169 and 170.]
551167 12.2.2LTRAINING DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics -On the 1st February, 25,185 men were in training, as against 25,063 on the25th January, and 24,964 on the 4th January. The number of men placed in trainingduring the week was 389. There were 16,181 men awaiting training, the correspondingtotals for the 25th January and the 4th January being 16,083 and 16,348 respectively.The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was24,990, the totals for the 25th January and the 4th January being 24,723 and 23,292respectively.Reductions in the waiting lists have been made in 8 divisions, but these have beenmore than counterbalanced by additions elsewhere, especially in Ireland and London.The numbers awaiting training have remained practically stationary since the first weekin December. It must, however, be borne in mind that the Irish figures, which now totalnearly 4,000, are rising steadily. When allowance is made for this exceptional case, thewaiting list problem can be regarded as having been simplified considerably since thefirst quarter of 1920.As regards numbers on the training rolls, London still stands easily first among thedivisions, with approximately 4,000 men under instruction, Scotland coming next with2,265. The South-Eastern, North-Western, West Midlands, Yorkshire, East Midlandsand South-Central Divisions all have over 1,500 men in training, the figures ranging from1,859 in the South-Eastern Division to 1,533 in the South-Central.At the end of January last year, when the number of men in training was between18,000 and 19,000, the waiting list contained over 28,000 names. To-day the formerfigure has risen by approximately 33 per cent., and the latter has fallen by about 40 per cent.Elementary Teachers. In the Training College Section at Sarisbury Court, arrange-ments have now been made for school practice, of which from 6 to 12 weeks are requiredby the Board of Education as an integral part of training. Certain of the larger ruralschools in the immediate neighbourhood are being used, as well as the handicraft schools atPortsmouth and Southampton. The necessary supervision is exercised by members ofthe staff. The men show a keen interest in this new phase of their training and havebeen warmly welcomed in the schools.To meet the need of a professional and technical reference library at this centre, theTreasury have sanctioned the payment of a grant to the Centrafi Library for Students,Tavistock Square, who in return will lend 500 suitable works, to be chosen by the Ministryof Labour. Sanction has also been, given for a similar arrangement on behalf of theSpringfield.Training College, Birmingham, which, it is hoped, will be opened within thenext few weeks.The Treasury have also agreed to provide, on payment of a nominal fee, text-booksand instruments, at a limited cost in each case, for men in training attending evening classeswhose fees are being paid by the Ministry, and to other men in training in cases where thetechnical officers of the Ministry advise that the books and instruments are likely to provespecially useful, both during and after instruction.Exhibitions. In the Annexe at Olympia, which has been put at the disposal of theTraining Department during the period of the Daily Mail Efficiency Exhibition, menin training will be seen at work in about 40 different trades, and the exhibits will berepresentative of the work carried out in practically all the divisions, including Scotland.Investigations. Prevailing industrial conditions make the finding of new openings amatter of first-rate importance, and investigations have been made into the possibilityof training and absorbing disabled men in velour hat making, music engraving, Frenchdyeing and cleaning, coir mat making, and bead bag making.Government Instructional Factories. During the - week ending the 29th January, therewas a net increase of 94 men on the rolls of the various Government Instructional Factories,and the total at the end of the month had reached 9,771. The Loughborough, SarisburyCourt, and Cricklewood factories now have each over 500 men in training, while at the CityHall, Manchester, and at Cardiff the numbers are above 400.The St. James&apos; Mill Government Instructional Factory, Norwich, in which, thoughthe factory has been on the active list for a few months only, there are now well over 200 menin training, was honoured by a visit from the King on the 2nd February.  His Majesty
had the opportunity of inspecting the work in a large number of trades, as the coursesestablished include vehicle building, carpentry and joinery, upholstery, cabinet making,chair making, painting, tailoring and boot and shoe making.The manager at Birtley reports that the plastering class are now carrying out decorativeand other work on the Walker Estate housing scheme. At this factory contracts to the valueof over  500 were completed during January, and there are contracts still in hand to thevalue of over  4,000. At the newly opened Derby Street Factory, Cheetham, Manchester,there are already contracts in hand to the value of over  1,000.Women&apos;s Training.Unemployed Women. There are 76 registered unemployed women in training. Nineare ex-Army Pay Corps clerks in Scotland, avIio are now training in clerical work.Fourteen women are taking a six months&apos; course in nursery nursing. This form of trainingis particularly successful; there is always a large demand for the women when trained,and good salaries are obtained. Thirty-eight women are training in cookery and generaldomestic work, in classes specially arranged in London and Cambridge, and fifteen areattending a yery succesful course for waitresses in London.A report has been received on the cookery class which was held in Westminster andclosed in December. At the end of the course all the thirteen trainees obtained over75 per cent, of the maximum marks. Ten have been placed in employment at salariesranging from  45 to  65 per annum, all found. An equally good report has been furnishedon the waitresses&apos; class which finished in December. All the trainees have been placedin employment in hotels and large restaurants.War Widows. The month&apos;s work in connection with the training of war widowshas produced very satisfactory results. There has been a reduction of 359 in the number ofoutstanding applications, which now stands at 795. Training has been sanctioned by thepanel in 171 cases. The number of widows who have begun training during the monthhas reached the unusually high figure of 218. One hundred of these trainees are attendingthe home dressmaking classes which have been specially organised at two centres in London,Very satisfactory progress reports are being received from both centres. Twenty-twowidows from London and the neighbouring areas have been placed in daily cookery classesin technical institutes and polytechnics, where they are receiving excellent instruction.During the month, thirty-three widows have completed training, and highly satis-factory reports on the progress made have been received in almost every case.Disabled Nurses. Twelve fresh applications have been received during the month.In only three cases have the applicants been able to decide definitely what fresh occupationto enter, the remainder being very much limited in their choice by their ill-health. Fournurses have passed the Apothecaries Hall examination on the conclusion of their trainingas dispensers.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 2nd February, agreements had been received at headquartersin respect of 45,608 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had beensanctioned in respect of 43,610 apprentices, employed by 17,344 employers. The totalnumber of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or bymutual agreement between the parties, is now 17,727.Wages. There has been a satisfactory solution of the long-standing difficulty ofagreeing upon a prescribed rate for the brass trade at Birmingham, where the industryrecognises several grades of workmen with different rates of wages. The operativesclaimed that the wages under the scheme should be based on the rate for the highest grade,and some, but not all, of the employers that they should be based on that of the lowestgrade. This latter view was supported by the employers&apos; association. After a series ofconferences, however, the employers have now agreed to adopt the wages of the highestgrade as the basis for the prescribed rate.Applications. Local headquarters for the South Midlands and Eastern area haverecently been successful in placing several unmated apprentices, and report that only afew remain to be provided for in their area. Unmated apprentices appear still to benumerous in the Yorkshire and East Midlands area, especially in the Leeds district. Localheadquarters believe that in the whole area their numbers reach 100.   Efforts are being
552169 12.2.21made &apos;to provide for them by means of institutional training; at Leeds, 32 engineeringapprentices have already agreed to accept such training, if it can be provided.Unemployment. In the South-Western area the number of apprentices who are beingsuspended indefinitely, or dismissed, is reported to be increasing at an alarming rate.Some employers have little hope of re-engaging them within a reasonable period, andconsequently requests for transfers to new firms are being made. This, however, may provedifficult. Apart from any attempts by employers to use the depression as a means ofescaping from their obligations, the trade unions prefer the apprentices to remain withtheir pre-war firms, even if this involves the dismissals of journeymen. Friction is alsolikely to arise if employers, with journeymen unemployed, engage the apprentices of otherfirms in preference to them.In South Wales employers have placed certain apprentices on short time, but localheadquarters anticipated that larger numbers would have been affected. Only oneapprentice is so far reported to have been actually dismissed ; and every effort is beingmade to induce employers to retain their apprentices as long as possible.Institutional Training. Proposals to utilise the Government Instructional Factoriesfor the training of men under the scheme have been put forward, but the sanction of theTreasury has been refused. It is feared that, generally speaking, this decision will renderthe increase of institutional training very difficult, since existing facilities for such trainingare being fully utilised already. The increasing demand for training from apprenticeswho are suspended or on short time seems likely to continue.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. Reports on the national scheme during the week haveagain been favourable. At Birmingham, the operatives were to meet on the 1st February,to consider the scheme among themselves, before conferring with the employers. Jointconferences have been definitely arranged at Coventry and Rugby. The scheme is alsoto be discussed between employers and operatives at forthcoming joint conferences, whichhad already been arranged for other purposes, at Blackheath, Kenilworth and WestBromwich. This is the more satisfactory in regard to Blackheath, as the employers&apos;association had previously rejected the scheme. At Worcester, the operatives havedefinitely agreed to meet the employers.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands area, joint conferences have been held at Notting-ham, Keighley and Dewsbury, and reached decisions favourable to the scheme. It isreported that a shortage of bricklayers&apos; and masons&apos; apprentices in the textile townsdoes.not extend to other districts.In the Northern area, the organisation of local apprenticeship committees has been fullydiscussed with the district secretary of the National Federation of Building Trades Opera-tives ; and it is hoped that this will expedite the election of their representatives to theproposed joint conferences in various districts. The local committee for the North Shieldsdistrict have already held their second meeting, and propose to meet fortnightly till thescheme is in thorough working order. So far, all those parts of the scheme which have beenconsidered have been accepted by both sides, except for the provision for compulsoryattendance at technical schools during working hours. Owing to objections by theemployers, this has been referred to the associations concerned.The least favourable report comes from East Anglia, where the decision of the EasternCounties Area Joint Council to adopt the national scheme is said to have been subsequentlyreversed in favour of the Norwich scheme. While, therefore, it is expected that local com-mittees will soon be at work at Luton and Ipswich, and possibly in other districts, they arelikely to be under the Norwich scheme.Apprenticeship : Engineering. In the industry at Bristol, where considerable interesthas been exhibited in the subject of apprenticeship, the absorption of existing apprenticesas adults is admitted by employers to constitute a grave problem. In some instances,the apprentice fitters are more numerous than the journeymen, and in one case they werefound to be in a ratio of 20 to each journeyman. Firms generally have far more applica-tions than they can deal with from boys wishing to become fitters or engineers, while, ashas been frequently reported from other districts, they have considerable difficulty ininducing them to enter such trades as ironmoulding.
Apprenticeship : Printing. In the London and South-Eastern area differing opinionsare expressed by employers in regard to the value of technical training. A Maidstone firm,for instance, regard it as unnecessary, while an Ashford firm are prepared to encourageattendance, and to pay fees, if suitable training can be provided at the local technicalschool. Some trade union representatives favour making attendance compulsory duringapprenticeship, notably the general secretary of the National Society of Electrotypers andStereotypers, who considers that in his trade instruction should be given in the principlesof electricity, in the chemicals used, and in working a dynamo. A representative of thePlaten Printing Machine Minders&apos; Society states that in some shops the men, through theirchapels, now take a greater interest in workshop training than in the past.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments willalso be found on pages 153, 154, 155 and 156.]
