The now Red  International of Trade Unions seems to be developing., taker&quot; and &quot;Solidarity&quot; devote much space to the movement and J.T.1&apos;urphy is reported  to have given money to several  members of the!Sheffield Workers&apos;  Committee. ]    The Labour Party Conference on unemployment had no result, but afurther meeting will be held on February 33rd.   Unemployment is still trowing and  the unemployed are reported to be listening more attentively 1 CommuniBt speakers. 1    As a result  of information given to the Press by this Department, to Secretary of  the International Socialist Club  has been asked by le landlord&apos;s solicitor to vacate the premises, j   According to the business manager of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, Trade lion delegates have promised   15,000 towards the  expenses of the lrthorn edition.   A considerable decrease in the sale of the paper  in Iventry is  reported.     An interesting statement  by a Durham miner on the proposed hue t ion of wages  is given.  J   Sinn fein in England is rather quiescent owing to Art 0&apos;Brien lUng gone  into  hiding.   An  Intercepted letter shows that his absence 1 embarrassing the extreme party in Dublin. i   There is little change in the situation In Ireland, but  prcepted  letters show that  there is a rift in the $inn Ifein party  I that the extremists are anxious to negotiate through an arbitrator  toad.   The state of terror  appears to be abating, for information  linst the  extremists is being reoeived daily.
UNMPIOYMBNO?     It was not to &quot;bo expected, that the Special Conferenceof the.Labour Party and Trade Union Congress, which v/as heldon January 27th, would do anything to relieve unemployment.The Conference adopted the proposals of the Joint LabourCommittee, as reported in the Press, and that was all.  Afurther Conference will be hold on February 23rd.     The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is of course trying to make mischiefand is publishing paragraphs inciting to  olass hatred.  Inan article entitled &quot;After the Conference&quot;, which appeared in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; on January 31st, Lansbury tells  the rank,and file that they themselves must settle the questionof,&quot;direct action&quot; before the date of the next conference,as no joint conference of officials or delegates iscompetent to give more than a load on such a matter.&quot;There is no reason why we should ask for weeks and monthsof general strike.   But 24 hours each week for a monthwould very soon bring the Government and Parliament toreason..... .We must marshal our forces and in doing somust make it clear that our fight is for the completeoverthrow of the present social order.&quot;     Contributions from the public to the unemployed arefalling off.  At Edmonton my correspondent recentlynoticed that outside a labour meeting collectors wereshaking empty boxes.  There is disagreement among theunemployed at Wood Green; the more militant section isreported to have broken away because they objected to  the others playing&quot; cards all day.  In Kensington the unemployedhave been warned by the Local Relief Fund Committee thatif they take part in processions and collections theirgrant from that fund will stop.     On January 26th the Southwark unemployed tookpossession of an unoccupied building;  on tho same day the Viood Green and Southgato&apos; Unemployment Committee                                           surrendered&apos;
                         M   ** surrendered possession ef the Wood Green Publio library.     On  January 27 th Dannie . Jennet t of Islington failed to  find  two  sureties  af  25  each  and  one  of   50 to be of good behaviour for 12 months and  was  sentenced  to 3 months1 imprisonment.   William Ray,  who,  with other unemployables attempted  to seiae the  Oamberwell Publio  Library, appeared at  Lambeth Police Court on January 28th for  using Insulting words fend  behaviour and  was  fined   3  for  the latter offence,     There  Is little indication of improvement in tho unemployment problem  in the  provinces,    A further increase in  the numbers of men and women   unemployed  is  reported  in Lancashire and  Cheshire,  the greatest increase  being in the Liverpool  area.     My Coventry oorrespondent states  that the engineers out of employment in  his district are taking more interest in  the speeches of local and  travelling agitators, whose persistent oomimonist propaganda shows signs  of  talcing effect On  january/y 24th an unemployed Workers1 Committee was formed in  Leicester,  where meetings of the unemployed are held every morning  in the Market  Plaoe,   Up to the present, however, the majority of the unemployed in this town refuse to  be led by the agitators.     In Hull, Bishop and Dick Beeoh are holding  unemploymentmeetings and urge the men to maroh to the workhouse to demand relief,    1 demonstration of unemployed  was hold in the Oity Hall, Glasgow,  on January 27th, at ^whloh  about  2,500 people were addressed by Councillor P,J,  Doliaa, John MoLean, Mrs, Helen Crawford  and  James M&amp;xton.   many men in this area are disinclined  to work  short  time, as  with the 15s, unemployed donation, together  with trade union unemployment benefits, mounting  sometimes                                                     to/
to  1 a week and allowances for childx-en,  they can pick upas much money without working at all as they can by workingshort time.THE C0MMUJJIBT &quot;&quot;UNITY&quot; C01PEMCE     There was a oomic side to the Conference of Communistsheld at Leeds on January 29th and 30th.  150 delegates fromthe Communist Party of Great Britain, the British Sectionof the Third International, the Communist Labour Party andother smaller groups attended on instructions from Moscowfor the formation of a united Party.  There was an air ofconspiracy about the proceedings.  The delegates representedthemselves as belonging to the National Fruiterers&apos;Association and under thin guise they obtained rooms atthe Victory,  the Imperial and the Golden Lion Hotels.  Asfruiterers they auoftetide&amp; in obtaining a meeting room atthe Victory Hotel,  but when the lioenaee discovered thathis rooms had been  engaged on a false pretext he mnt tothe Police about it.  During the course of the proceedings&apos;there were stormy incidents and at one point, it is said,an enoounter with fiats.  Nevertheless, &quot;unity&quot; was established *     The following groups were represented:       Communist Party of Great Britain........* 103       Communlst Labour Party ...................  31       Communist Party of British Section          of Third International ...............  14       Aberdeen Communist Group .................   1       Left Wing oi Independent Labour Party ....   t       Industrial Communist Party ...............

All present paid officials of the     contracting parties and the editor of the party organ     shall be taken over provisionally and continue in their     posts until suoh time as the rules of the new party     are definitely determined, and all the positions within     the party are thrown open to the methods of election     and appointment decided upon by these rules.   They shall     be subjeot to the jurisdiction of the Executive Committee.     The strongest objection was taken to this by the platformand it was probably at this point that the physical encountertook place, but in the end the platform was over-ruled andthe information had to be given.   It was as follows:
Ill           The  Communist labour Party has no paid             officials.           Tho  British  section of  the Third International             has  one paid official:                     Secretary -   5 per week,           The  Communist Party of  Great Britain has the             following paid  officials:             Chairman  (Arthur McMsnus)    7.10.0. ner week             Secretary (Albert Inkpin)    7.10.0.  &quot;    &quot;             Organising National                Secretary  (Tho&amp;ifvS  Bell)    7.10.0.  &quot;    &quot;             Publication  Dept.

Unity having thus  been established,  the real fightingwill begin.     An official on the platform stated that  the party had nofinancial responsibility for the Circulation Manager of thepaper and it would have been better if the question had not beenasked.  There were things which it was absolutely futile toask.  &quot;There will be things in connection with this organisation, both in the past and in the future that members will not be able to learn, and actually the position withrogard to those two persons connected with the paper isexaotly the kind of thing that neither your Executive nor theThird International would allow to be published broadcast because we - I will put it absolutely frankly - are an illegal as well                                                     as/
as a legal organisation;  we aro handling stuff which iacombustible and I do suggest to the conference that when you ask for the officials and the officials are given that we have done what the conference asked/&apos;     Delegate Chapman said &quot;The situation now is that ifyou get the.information you wanted then you have got it,and having got it you are asked to exercise some amountof discretion.  The actual situation is, so far as we areconcerned  ... we have got the responsibility to administer the organisation, but we are 3imply a section of the ThirdInternational and the Third International send instruction,that must  be carried out.  They don&apos;t appreciate many ofthe difficulties- at all - they lo;.v t appreciate airydifficulties, and we have had to borrow, we have had to be$money, and we have had to assume responsibilities, and thatsays quite sufficient.  I do want  to make this pointclear - that in  future so far as enquiries like thiscoming to  the Executive themselves, I want the executive to be appointed  and entrusted with the  responsibility  ofbeing capable of exercising the necessary discretion.&quot;     Tom Bell, called upon to make a statement regardingthe working of the  party  and the position of the partyorgan, &quot;The Communist&quot;, said that  they  had split thecountry into siz divisions and that they had placed  anorganising secretary  in each division,  and when the  time came they  hoped  to  have the machinery  intact to  carryon the various industries.     Francis Meynell,  the editor of  &quot;The Communist&quot;,said that  the  policy of  &quot;The  Communist&quot; would be  thepolicy of  the  Executive  Council,  the  policy  of the ThiroSInernational and the intensive cultivation of class                                              hatred/  v
      hatred and class discontent.   Ha  intended  to  make  &quot;Tha      Communist&quot; the downright olass war  paper that it ought  to      he or he  would leave the position.  He  said  that during the      war,  before the war and since  the war he had  been  a      director  of &quot;The Daily  Herald&quot;.&quot;THE COMMUNIST&quot;           Tho  organ of the Communist Party,  which  continues  to      advertise itself in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;  as  a  &quot;jewel of a      paper&quot;,  is increasing its circulation,  owing  largely to the      energy of individual  sellers.  Messrs. W.H.  Smith &amp; Co.,      state that within 6 weeks the  demand has increased from      5 quires  (50 copies) to 50 quires.  The manager of thi3      firm now  reports, however,  &quot;we have bought this week?s  issue,      and  as It appears so outspokenly revolutionary we  are putting      it under  lock and key,  and  will not distribute it, although      this  will mean a loss to us.   We do not mind  this as we shall      refuse to handle supplies in future.  We are  so informing      our  other branches in the provinces, and other wholesalers      in the City.&quot;           Messrs.  Marshall have  endorsed this action and  it  is      expected  that the other distributors will  do  the same.      The paper is  mischievous but not at all well  edited.  It      is opfcnly stated by the Communists that it is being  floated      with  the. money realised by  Meynell from the jewels brought      over  by Kameneff and Xrassin. TH5 HEP INTERNATIONAL OP TRAPS UNIONS           The  manifesto and  circular appears to have been issued      in various districts but has  obtained little publicity.      This  fact is  no  doubt due,  in part, to  the action of Trade                                                     Union/
&quot;* Q *&quot;      Union officials who view with  disfavour and alarm a movement      which,  if successful,  must cost them their positions.   It      is  significant that the  committee  of a miners&quot;  lodge in      the Rhondda district turned down the manifesto  without      submitting  it  to the members.   Several  other lodges in      South Wales are reported to have followed  the earns  course.           The  organisers of the  movement,  however, are  abnormally      active and  it  is noteworthy that the  &quot;VTorker&quot; and      &quot;Solidarity&quot; have recently  doubled their number of  pages, thi      latter at  the  same  time  halving  He price.           Murphy appears  to be the direct  agent  of Moscow and      is  reported to  have given money  to several,  of the militant     members of the  Sheffield Workers&apos; Committee, each of whom     pledged himself  to  secrecy  regarding  tho transaction. &apos;Lienw     the organising  secretary of  the  British Bureau, has given     up bis work as  a fitter and as a branch official and Is     devoting himself entirely to the work of the Bureau.          This movement must ba watched with care for it is     quite likely to  grow.THE Iff TERM ZONAL S      van Labour sesme about to suspect that it is sufferingfrom a plethora of Internationals and fi. J. Gillespieespressos this feeling in a recant issue of the *daily herald&quot;:          &quot;&apos;Tbe Internationale unites the Human Race&apos;.     $hug at conferences and places where they sing.  Thus.     one suspects,  at Babel during Dr. Nimrod&apos;8 great housii     campaign in the land of Shiner.  And yet there is not     one International, but several Internationals.  And tW      Human Race remains obstinately divided.          &quot;There is tho International of Marx, which, being     dead, yet spoaketh.  There is the International of ,     Berne, from which - it having been in the grave only     four days - cometb neither miracle nor silence.  There     is the International of Moscow, which, like radium,     itself radiating heat and power, yet disintegrates                                     everything/
       everything with which It comes in contact.  It reduces       organisms to their element try factors end absorbs them.       It does not Tunite&apos;.  T:numerous is the International of       Vienna, whioh is a dictatorship without a dictator, a       oread v ithout a cross.            &quot;The International solidarity of Labour never yet       stooped a war - on wages, on a oeonle, or on an idea.       The Council of Action stooped a Russian war becauBO       British Labour would not fight anybody, not because it       loved Russian Labour.            &quot;Our Internationalists think to overthrow emniros       when they oannot overturn the moneychangers in the temple.       They hope to povern the world when their constituents       cannot keon control of a oarish oouncil.&quot;COAL ISIH1SRS       1 have had m Interesting talk v1th a miner who worked  for many years in Lord Londonderry&apos;s collieries in Durham end  then went to America,  where he also worked in collieries.  Re came to England to  visit his relations in Durham and after  some stay among  the miners has given his impressIons as  follows:       T;.e Durham miners aro generally expecting a reduction  of wages, whioh  they  viow  Quite calmly find without any  thought of resistance.   When one of the nc a papers last week &apos; stated that a reduction of 2/- wrs contemplated they said  thoy  expected it would be more and his impress! n was that t&quot;-ey would  have oooepted the 3/-  reduction without murmuring.   He is  very  strongly of opinion that this is the psychological  moment  for  making  a reduction, for te believes that the miners quite  understand t^e economic situation.   H.) tninks that this :jas been  brought home to them by tho fact that  30,noo tons of coal  have  recently been landed  in the tyne from China.   It is natural for  a Durham man to think  tJiet what Durham does to-day  aoutb Wales  will do to-morrow,  and he  is  very optimistic  about  the attitude  of the coal miners  all  over the country.  Re went on to say that  Mr.  Smillie has lost  influence to a very marked degree. &apos;Ke  LIT hem miners&amp;couse him of dealing  in  cctoh-uords whioh mean  nothing.                                       R^USIM/
                                                            *  HOUSING           There appears to he some discontent in the Glasgow      district regarding the allocation of completed houses; it      is.alleged that preferential treatment is given to Corporation      officials.  Ex-Service and manual workers demand prior      consideration, hut it cannot be said whether their allegations      of favouri%im  are justified.   50,000 bouses are said to be      required in the Glasgow area,  but so far only about 300 have      been finished; the Homeless Ex-Servioe Men&apos;s Association is      Showing some activity and it is feared that the revolutionaries      may obtain control of this organisation in which case trouble      may eventuate.THE CO-OPEBATIVS MOTOMT           On January 89th a conference of representatives of      retail co-operative societies  and of branches of the Co-      operative Party and Co-operative Guilds in the  Northern      District was held at Newcastle  to discuss the proposed      alliance with the Labour  Party.   A resolution in favour of the      Alliance was strongly opposed by the Chairman of the Northern      Board and war defeated by 253  to 84  votes.   This conference      is a further indication of awakening on the  part of the      ordinary co-operators,  the majority  of whom appears to think      that alliance with  the  Labour movement may plaoe dividends in      jeopardy. INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST  CLUB           The propaganda value of information  given  to the  Press      by this  department  is  indicated  by  the  fact  that as a  result      of the disclosure that  the  International  Socialist Club was      the  headquarters  of the committee  of the  London  unemployables,                                                          the/
the landlord1a solicitor has given the secretary of the  clubnotice to vacate the premises, &quot;in order to make room for apatriotic club.&quot;  He further denounced Bolshevism and concluded by reminding the secretary that the rent due in December had  notbeen paid.  A post dated cheque for  140 has accordingly beensent to the solicitor, but as the Club&apos;s overdraft stands at  00, it will scarcely be met, unless the negotiations,  whichthe Club is oonducting with Inkpin and MacManus for a loan of 1,000 are successful.VIOLFJT SPSS0H5S          W, Gallacher and J..V. Leckie, of the Clyde,  addressed     meetings during the week in the Birmingham Bull Ring;  they     have also spoken in other Midland towns,  holding in some  cases     three meetings a day, and had a very disturbing effect.   The     following are extracts from their speeohes at Birmingham,  which     have been submitted to the Director of Public Proseoiitions:     Gallacher, January 27th (Afternoon)               &quot;In Liverpool and Manchester there has been  trouble          with the unemployed and that trouble has awakened the          responsible class.  If you are content to remain  quiet          they will let you starve in peace, but if you break  out,          they begin to take: an interest in you .... Instead of you          emigrating to Canada, Australia or Afrioa as the          capitalists tell you to, what you workers must do is to          take possession of your own country ... What you  have got          to do is to get your own papers and to organise in your          trade union branches which for the present is only the          shop stewards movement, whioh will then be a Shop Stewards          Council when a Soviet System is established in Britain          like that in Russia.&quot;     Gallaoher. January 27th (Evening)               &quot;My advice to you is to get organised Into your          &quot;branch unions and get hold of the land and industry  of          this country which are in the hands  of a few (Cries  of          &apos;Hear, Hear&apos;).  Crisis is becoming more serious every day.          Europe is tottering and is in the throes of^starvation          and disease,  and we in this country  are sinking nearer and          nearer to the pit.  Unless we decide that the employed          and unemployed march together towards the conquest of          Industry - unless we do that we shall be handing &apos;down a          legacy to our children.  (Tremendous cheering).  Let  us          fight together as one, let us die as one, let us  march          like our Russian comrades did, determined to  overthrow the          Capitalist system and establish a system similar  to  that          of Russia.  (Tremendous cheering and clapping of  hands          for a few minutes).
Leckle at the same meeting, devoted most of his attentionto the police and produced an extraordinary effect on theaudience:          &quot;Friends, we are revolutionists, we are rebels,     up with Sinn Fein, up with Rebellion...          &quot;-Vake up you rebels.   We want Irishmen here     because they can use their fists and other things if     neoessary.   Those are the people who don&apos;t trouble     about spies; bring as many as you can here to our     next meeting,  f Cries of 11 We will&apos; ).   At one of our     meetings we had a number of Irishmen on tho roof     who wero equipped with rifles end I told the     Superintendent of Polioe, who sent a spy to take     notes and six others as a bodyguard, that if they     dare lay a finger on anyone in the room it would be     all up with them/&apos;  The audience then commenced to jump     and shout, &quot;Go on Leekie rvb it in, you are showing them     up now, they are feeling their positions.&quot;          &quot;Workers, march forward, many of us were 3ent down     and many of us will follow.   We are rebels, we are out     for Revolution and a Revolution we are going to have.     Organise strongly; as long as my back is protected I     can manage my front,   (Tremendous cheering).   I don&apos;t     care a damn for Lloyd George or his spies.   I say that     Lloyd George is a murderer (The audience  was stamping    and shouting and the speaker was raving, pulling hiB hair    and weeping;  Get that down, get that down in your     book that Lloyd George is a bloody murderer and I     am prepared to say so whilst be answers the charge of      the murder of McCurtain.   A verdict was returned     that the murder was committed by the R.I.Cs. and dirty     rotten curs like we have here under the orders of Lloyd     George; that&apos;s/why I oall him a murderer.  (Tremendous     cheering).   Again I will say &apos;Up with Sinn Fein, up     with Rebellion, up.with Revolution&apos;.   March onward&quot;you   - workers and take possession of all and keep it for the     workers the only class that concerns us.&quot;  The audience     jumped on the.seats and shouted themselves hoarse.    v          &quot;Friends, all I have said will be carried by     these spying curs to the authorities (Cries of 1 Shame&apos;)     and when I attend here in a-fortnight&apos;s time I expect     we will have a large number of these spies (Cries of     1 Shame&apos;, &apos;tfe wonTt have them&quot;).  But I am not afraid of     the curs.   (The audience cheered and shouted).   I will     be here and will say just what I think.   You workers     must try and bring Irishmen;  Iriehmen are the boys who     oan use their fists and other things.   (Great excitement     amongst the,audience)   And they will soon finish the     spies.  (Cries of &apos;Hear, Hear and a good job too&apos;).     Yes, we will not be pestered with these curs any     longer.&quot;  (Tremendous cheering).H. Webb (on the Provisional executive of the new CommunistParty of Great Britain),at Sheffield on January 23rd saidthat he had come to Sheffield with Bolshevik ideas which hewas going to explain, and :cared nothing about the consequences                                                        The/

His idea of getting rid of the fBossf  class  dictatorship was a Revolution.  &quot;We want men who understand  a  gun,  and oan use them&quot;.   He exhorted his hearers to join th^  Red International Army,  and to use  the  mailed first,  strike  t^he  capitalist full in the face,  and then prepare for the counter-)  revolution whioh would be the Military.   The capitalistswould  use all the methods available to put down the working classes;,  because they know that if they lose the  fight they  will  have  work.       There is always a lull in violent speeches  after one or  tv/o successful proseoutions,  and the time seems  now to have  arrived when the  policy of  proseoutions  should be resumed.MAL0N5r  M.P.       The  Secretary of State,  ohieily on  account  of an appeal  from  the   Speaker,  allowed  Malone to attend  his  mother&apos;s  funeral on January 28th.&apos;-       The  communists  intend  to  bring  as much  influence as possible  to  bear  in  order to get Malone  transferred to the First Division.      On January 20th, 500 people attended a meeting at Leyton to protest  against  tho imprisonment  of Malone.   A member of  the audience moved a  resolution that &quot;the Government  be asked to deal more eeverely with such men as  Malone.   If  Malone had said such things  in any other  country he would have been shot.&quot; The man was, however, shouted down and asked to leave  the hall.                                                          &apos; s&quot;flAILY R5RALD&quot;                                               \      If the statement of Herlord, the business manager of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, can be believed, trade union delegates to the Liverpool meeting on January 30th promised  150,000 towards the                                                    expenses/
ftIIi  expenses  of  the  &quot;Daily Herald&quot; northern  edition.   The  sum  stated by Bevin  to be necessary  to  start the  edition was,?  will be remembered,  ;2200,000.   It  iB announced that a  &quot;Development Committee&quot; has been formed and that the premie  are nearing oompletion: it was hoped that they would be rea  by the end of March.-    &apos;  On the evening of January 30th a &quot;Daily Herald&quot; meetiu  in the Stadium was attended by 5,000 people and was address  inter alios by Ben Turner, Robert Williams and Mrs. Bamber  about 900 people were present at an overflow meeting in thj Pic ton Hall.  The attendance is  of  some importance in view  the faot  that the majority of the seats cost Is. and 6d. eai  The speeches contained little new matter although Robert Williams delivered a bitter diatribe against the working  classes whom he  stigmatised as &quot;Damn fools more than evert  slaves of the capitalists,&quot; and  enquired &quot;Why the Hell don&apos;] you wake up and put an end to this hellish system?^&apos;      My Coventry correspondent states that the sale has fal off since the price has been raised.  The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; for this district is much perturbed over this and has said reoently that he cannot understand this falling off, as Coi has always been the best market in his area.  The alarmist reports regarding the industrial situation in this city, wh local workers know to be exaggerated,  haB done the paper mm harm, and the untruths which it reported regarding the unemf ;there has last it many customers.      The link between the &quot;Daily Her&amp;ld&quot; and &quot;Red&quot; trade un officials receives special emphasis from the fact that the j issue of the monthly journal of the Amalgamated Engineeringdevotes  10 pages to a history and puff of the paper and con with  the  following exhortation:                           I                                                    &quot;Reform&apos;

The usual Sinn  Fein meetings have been  held and the Labour     Party&apos;s oampaign is in progress, but nothing  of  exceptional     importance has transpired.   Some resentment against  the  decision     not to publish General Strioklandfs report has been  expressed.          It is reported that a series of fourteen leaflets has been     prepared and  is being supplied to local Labour  organisations     for distribution at meetings and systematic door-to-door     delivery.   The leaflets deal with different phases of the     so-called reign of violence in Ireland,  and the  alleged  misrule     of the British authorities.          On Jejiuary 25th 400 miners, employed at  Giffncck Colliery,     near Glasgow,  struck work as a protest  against the military     occupation of Ireland.  When the protesting colliers attended     the pithead on January 86th to resume work they  found a  notice     posted intimating  that the  colliery would be  closed to  suit the     convenience of the company.  The men, to their discomfiture,                                                         were/

John Maclean has been aporoached     for assistance and advice.IRELAND          There was no appreciable change in the state of the     provinces during the week although a decrease in the total&apos;     number of outrages is shown: unfortunately it is not indicative     of any improvement.   Murders of police and military oontinue     unabated,  and are restricted only by lack of opportunity  and     by the precautions and activity of the Crown Forces.  186     outrages were reported, 139 of whioh were attributable to   -  Sinn Fein.          It is not unlikely that increased activity on the part     of the murder gang will be  displayed in the near future as     reliable information is to  hand that sealed orders have been     issued by  the Irish  Republican Army Headquarters directing     that as many police  and military as possible are to be     murdered during the  month of February.  This is no doubt     intended to impress  the British Parliament and to indicate     the  hopelessness of continuing to keep Ireland in &quot;subjection&quot;.          There is no doubt that the successes of the Irish     Republican Army murder campaign hew greatly heartened these  who     are  in sympathy with Sinn Fein and de Valera&apos;s manifesto  has     had  the effect of removing  tho,shadows of doubt which the talk     of negotiation had oast over the followers &apos;of the extremists.     As the Sinn Fein paper &quot;Old Ireland&quot; puts it&apos; &quot;the events  of  lasj     week were  far from discouraging.   The news as it thus travels     may  be summed up in  the very definite feelirig of inoreased hope     of suooess in the minds of  Irish men and women1...  It may be     frankly said  that Irish opinion has steadied very considerably     since the  last peace offensive.&quot;                                                        An/
     An intercepted letter shows, however, that there is a growing and rather &quot;bitter breach between the more moderatesection of Sinn Fein and the violent seotion, which nowadmits that some kind of arbitration by a neutral is necessary.     In accordance with instructions received the policehave made no efforts to trace the whereabouts of &quot;president de Valera&quot; or  to interfere with him in any way.   A manifestowas issued by that gentleman couched in suoh terms that eventhe Irish Press refrained from publishing it.   A copy ofthis manifesto is not available but a portion of it was putin a leaflet calling for funds for the Irish Republican Armyand widely circulated in Ireland by hand.
