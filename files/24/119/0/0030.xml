(P 548)       From Secretary of Stale to Viceroy, Foreign Department,                               \sl February 1921;    Priority A.    ()G9.   Your telegram 1431  of 15th December.   Commercial  clauses in AfghanTreaty.    Amendment  suggested  in para.  14  of  ShuckburglTs  letter to  Board of trade would  not involve alteration  of clause 4 (k) lo harmonise with any Transit Conventionratified by India unless provisions of Afghan Treaty were  inconsistent  with  thoseof Convention,  If  Convention  did not  apply owing to  absence of through, railwaycommunication between India and Afghanistan clause 4 (It) would stand as in yourtelegram 958 S. of 30th July, but if through railway communications were establishedsuggested amendment would become operative, irrespective of adherence of Afghanistan,if another high  contracting party invoked Article 6 and  could show valid  reasons.No question of surrender of  transit dues levied in  Afghanistan seems to arise untilAfghanistan adheres to Convention and rail connection through Afghanistan  to Persiaor Central Asia is  effected.   If Treaty be concluded  before ratification of  ConventionArticle 10 of latter would  probably not apply, but as Treaty  negotiations and consideration of Convention  will proceed simultaneously it seems desirable on general grounds to insert in clause 4 (It) suggested addition  which in present conditions onlyaims  at regularising  India&apos;s position  vis-a-vis  other  high  contracting  parties.Consequently there is no need to insert words &quot;and Afghanistan &quot; as you propose.     Clause 4 (j),  as drafted in your telegram of the 30th -July,  prohibited exportfrom Afghanistan  to countries which prohibited or regulated  the  import of opium,while permitting unrestricted export to all other  countries.   Export  to countries inthe first category could not reasonably be objected to, subject to the conditions whichthey might impose  while  unrestricted export  to countries in the second class wouldbe likely to defeat  object of Hague Convention, and  so  provoke criticism againstIndia  from signatories of that Convention  and from anti-opium societies.   Aiueiid-ment  suggested  in my telegram  of  the  3rd  November 1920 was  designed to  meet these objections to  your original draft.     The  number of countries  not already  bound  to enforce Hague Convention is small,  and they are comparatively unimportant.  In the  circumstances I consider itpreferable to adhere to draft proposed in  my telegram of the 3rd November.     Your telegram of 7th January, 29 S.  I have not yet been able to obtain definiteopinion as to Egypt&apos;s position  in regard to Opium  Convention.   But as there is no evidence  of any opium being exported from India to Egypt during recent years, andas Afghan exports  into India average only 850 lbs.  for last five years, 1 am inclined to  doubt seriousness  of Afghan desire to find market in Egypt; especially if official report of Mussoorie Conference accurately represents &quot;what passed on subject.
