GENERAL.       Nil.                           PART II. DEPARTMENTAL.The Local Employment Committees.    Although with the gradual progress of resettlement the work of the Local Employ-ment Committees, associated with the Employment Exchanges, has diminished to come degree both in urgency and volume, these bodies continue to render important assistanceto the Ministry on many sides of its work.  The Employment Councils were dissolved, for reasons of economy, in September of last  year.  This removed the co-ordinating bodiesby  whom the Employment  Committees were brought into touch one  with  another.Measures are to be taken, however, which will provide in cases where joint consultationis indispensable, for Divisional Conferences of members of the Committees. The Employ-ment Committees themselves have  shown by their inter-circulation of resolutions andrecommendations that they are fully aware of the necessity for taking a wide  outlookon the larger problems with which they are  called upon to deal.    The Ministry is still indebted to the Committees  for assistance in administering the out-of-work donation scheme.  This now. affects only ex-Service men,  members of the   (O 1957) 140  1/20 H &amp; 8                                                     G
mobile sections  of the Women&apos;s Forces,  and members of the mercantile marine.  Asregards ex-members  of the  Forces, the extension of the  donation beyond the  originalperiod of 26 weeks for which it may be drawn still lies in the hands of the Committees.The grant of the special  extension of donation for nine weeks before the 31st March, incases  where the  applicant has exhausted his policy or where the period for which it wasvalid has expired, is also a matter for the Committees who are  required to be satisfiedthat  applicants  fulfil the  conditions  of the scheme.   As regards  members  of  the mercantile marine, for whom a  similar  extension for nine weeks  has  been granted,the function of approving the application falls either to the Local Employment Committee,or,  where such a body exists, to the Port Labour Committee.  In addition to the usualqualifications, the applicants must show to the satisfaction  of the Committee that theywere  employed as merchant  seamen for at least three months between the outbreak ofwar and the date of the armistice.    The withdrawal  of  the  out-of-work  donation for civilian workers has  caused  theLocal  Employment  Committees to pay special attention  to the problem of relievingunemployment in their areas. The Committee of the National Relief Fund, at the instanceof the Government, decided to make  the  balance of that fund available for the relief of distress directly due to the war.  They accordingly approached  all local authorities inEngland and Wales, with the exception of  Rural District Councils, suggesting that where these  authorities were of  opinion that  distress directly due to the war justified applicationfor a grant from the fund, a  special committee should be set up to deal with the question,and that  these  committees  should include representatives  of the Local employment committees in the area.   The Employment Committees may be said, therefore, to havea double function in this connection.  It is falling to their lot in places to urge the localauthorities to set up  these Relief Committees.  Where this step is taken, they are puttingat the disposal of the local authorities the experience which they have gained under theMinistry.   The  Committees  have  not,  of course, confined  themselves to this work inconnection with the  National Relief Fund, but have in many cases renewed their efforts to point out to local authorities ways and means  of relieving unemployment, by carryingon  public works, housing schemes and similar projects.    The Committees have been intimately connected  from  its commencement with theNational Scheme for the  employment of disabled men.  It is to them that  is assigned the function of investigating  and accepting as  satisfactory the undertakings under the schemegiven by employers, and authorising the inclusion of firms in the National Roll.  Muchexcellent work has been done in the way of canvassing and keeping the scheme prominentlybefore the public.  The measure of success  which the scheme has already attained must be attributed in no small part to the activities of the Employment Committees.  They are,moreover, still associated with the Ministry  in the  work  of authorising grants for thepurchase of tools under the Civil Liabilities (Military Service)  Scheme ;  and, although thevolume of work involved has so far been  not large, their services have been used by theLocal War Pensions  in  the assessment of alternative pensions for disabled men.  TheEmployment  Committees assist the Training Department in assisting apprentices whohave  served  with the Forces  to resume their training. Thus, for example, in bringing into operation the general scheme applicable to  trades for which no special scheme hasbeen  considered necessary, the Employment Committees have been asked to decide  onthe firms who come  within the trades to which the scheme has already been applied, tomake recommendations  on  each  application as  to whether  the  apprentice in questioncomes within the purview of the scheme,  and to advise on  the extension of the generalscheme to other trades.   In  the administration  of the women&apos;s  training schemes, theEmployment Committees still continue, through their women&apos;s sub-committees, to assistthe department by interviewing and selecting candidates for training.    Administrative functions of  the nature indicated above,  however, form probably the smaller part of the Committees&apos; activities. They were brought into being in the firstplace as advisory committees,  and  their advisory functions still  remain  of primary importance.  They are in a  position to remove small local difficulties, and to deal withthe mistaken  criticism which is apt to hinder the work of the Employment Exchanges.They can draw the attention of the Ministry to local opinion and feeling, and thus enable it to  make its position clear.  Deputations, for example, from Employment committees in the London and South-Eastern districts have  recently  been received by the Ministerand by officials  of the  Training Department on the  question of training facilities  for disabled men.  The result has been that evidence of the difficulties which the Departmenthave met in their work, the progress already made, and the solid foundation which justifiesan  optimistic outlook for the future, have been  brought  to the  notice of the localitiesconcerned in an effective manner.  This function of local inquiry  and suggestion is being
applied in very many  directions.  Thus, for example, in November the employment committees were asked to co-operate with the Exchange managers in getting into touchwith building employers and obtaining full information as to the date of completion ofany contract which they might have in hand, in order that building.labour might be diverted as quickly as possible to other building operations.  In connection with the newUnemployment Insurance Bill, again, the Local Employment Committees are being used as one of the means of obtaining opinions and suggestions.  The Bill is to be placed beforethe Committees for consideration, and it is proposed at a later date to hold divisionalconferences of representatives of the Committees in order that criticism and suggestions.for emendation may be  brought  forward on a wide basis.                   PART III. THE LABOUR AND SOCIALIST PRESS.Russia.     The discussion of  the Russian situation in the Labour and Socialist Press this week is based upon the announcement made in the  English Press on the 17th January, thatthe  Supreme Council had decided to allow the re-opening of trading relations with theRussian people, and to  use the  Russian co-operative organisations  for this purpose.The predominant  note  of the articles is one of surprise,  mingled with suspicion of the motives which have caused this  development in Allied policy.  The  most confidentarticle appears in  the  &quot; Labour Leader.&quot;  This journal considers the  announcement tobe a tacit admission on the part of the Supreme Council of the failure of the policy it has previously pursued in  Russia.   It  looks  forward  to  a  speedy settlement of  the wholeRussian problem and believes that full recognition  of the Moscow Government  will followas a matter of course.   The &quot; New  Statesman &quot; thinks it wise to insist that the Supreme&apos;Council will not be able to put its policy into practice until it has secured the completeco-operation of the French Government.  This paper puts forward a suggestion that onthe  English side also the co-operative  organisations  should  be  used as the medium of inter-communication.  The &quot; New Statesman &quot; is of  the opinion that such a resumptionof trade relations must lead to some kind of recognition  of the Soviet Government as thede facto Government in Russia.  This paper makes this development in Allied  policy theoccasion of a confession that its views with regard to the Soviet experiment have changed..Hitherto it has maintained that Allied support  ol  the counter-revolutionary forces inRussia has been the main source of the popularity of the  Soviet rule, and has  supportedthose who believed that the withdrawal of Allied pressure would  be followed by the collapse of Lenin&apos;s government.  It now professes the opinion that the Bolshevists  have proved their power to govern,  and  that their  prestige and popularity rest rather upon their positive  governmental achievements than upon anti-alien sentiment.   A  similardevelopment in opinion has for some time been noticeable in the I.L.P. journals,  andmay perhaps be attributed to the efforts of Mr. W. T. Goode, who contributes this week a laudatory article on the Bolshevist government to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and advocates.a frank and open peace with Moscow.   The &quot; Nation &quot; has not yet reached this position,.and expresses a hope that the Russian co-operatives may be able to use their strengthenedposition to influence andsober the Soviets.   The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and &quot;Justice &quot;&apos;are more intractable.  The former paper  warns its readers to receive the announcementof Allied policy with great reserve, and devotes  an  article to a history of the attitude adopted by the Labour Party  towards  Russia.  The article concludes that the Labour-Party is using the Russian cry merely as  a means of  winning power in this country and callsupon the workers to drive the leaders of the party from the  seats of authority.   &quot; Justice &quot;&apos;emphasizes  its robust  refusal to recognise the legitimacy of the  claim of the Soviet.Government to be Socialist.The Labour Movement.     The discussion on  the political  future of  the Labour  Party,  in the form  ithas  taken  since  the  Spen  Valley by-election and the Sunderland  speech*  of  theSecretary of State for War is  now subsiding.   It  may be noted, however, that  the&quot;Nation&quot; and Mr. J. H. Palin, in the &quot;Bradford  Pioneer,&quot; endorse  the criticisms whichhave been appearing recently in the &quot; New Statesman &quot; upon the trade union bias of theLabour Party.   &quot;The  Call&quot; contains one of its  periodical discussions of the value of                               * 3rd January.(C 1957)                                                                G2
 political action as a means of Socialist propaganda, and Mr. T. Quin uses the Spen Valley result to show how propitious the times are for revolutionary political action.  The Irish municipal elections and the success in them of many Labour candidates attract attention in many papers.   The method of election (P.R.) is noticed, however, only in the &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; The Call.&quot;   &quot; The  Call&quot; claims that P.R. has worked smoothly and has resulted in a triumph of the workers.  Therefore, it is argued, the P.R. method should be used in all elections. The Industrial Situation.     The agreement arrived at between the Ministry of Transport and  the National Union of Railwaymen is not received with any enthusiasm in these papers.  The &quot; New States- man &quot; believes it to  have been made &quot; under protest,&quot; and hints that the negotiations with  the Railway Clerks&apos; Association may yet cause trouble.  This paper objects to the proposals for the grading of signalmen as involving  the recognition of &quot; payment by results.&quot;   &quot; The  Call&quot;  complains that the railwaymen have been  defeated, and  attacks the railwaymen&apos;s officials,  while Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; comforts himself with the hope  that  the settlement is not  &quot; for all time.&quot;  The decision of the ironfounders to return to work was arrived at too late  for discussion in these papers, and the only reference to  the strike of the employees of the Pearl Life  Assurance Company is contained  in  the &quot; Nation,&quot; whieh  commends the part taken by  the  Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress in the negotiations which led to  a settlement. It may be noted that in &quot; The Call&quot; Mr. A. Siffleet indulges in  an attack upon all trade union officials and enunciates the principle that no trade union official should be paid more than the &quot; other workers in his union &quot; may earn.  The &quot; New Statesman &quot; refers to the demand reported to have been made by the  Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federation that  the  trade unions in  the  shipbuilding  and engineering industry should-agree  to the universal adoption of  systems of  &quot; payment by  results.&quot;   The usual arguments against such systems are put forward, and it is contended  that their adoption need  by no means solve the problem of output.   The attitude of the  &quot; New Statesman &quot;-on the matter is, however, by no means a rigid one.   It is recognised that in many branches of the industry piecework systems are firmly rooted, and it is suggested that the prevalent trade  union  attitude to piecework  in these  trades might be  modified,  provided that  collective &quot; systems alone were proposed, and that the piecework bases were arrived  at by  open collective bargaining through shop committees, Prices and Profiteering.    Mr. W.  Mackinder&apos;s  allegations  of profiteering in worsted yarns Avould appear  to have  puzzled these papers,  and the  majority of  them  confine  themselves  to a  careful repetition of his statement at the meeting of the Central Profiteering Committee, as reported in the London Press on  the 17th January.  The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot;  is not  so scrupulous and interprets Mr. Mackinder as saying that woollen manufacturers are  making profits amounting to 3,200 per cent.  The  &quot; British Citizen &quot; is the paper which receives these allegations with the greatest enthusiasm.  It has long been, the  only paper to have much faith in the efficacy  of the Profiteering Act, and it now expresses the opinion that these disclosures of the  Standing Committee on the Investigation of Prices fully illustrate the uses of the Act.  It may be noted that the periodical article in this paper on the solution  of the problem of industrial unrest adds to its programme  of co-partnership a demand  for the limitation of profits. Wages and the Cost of Living.    The inclusion in the railwaymen&apos;s agreement of  a provision  for the regulation  of wages, in accordance  with the  &quot;Labour Gazette&quot;  cost of living index number, aroused discussion on the wisdom of this principle in the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;*  To some extent this discussion is reflected in the Labour and Socialist weekly Press ; Mr. R. B. Suthers, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; and &quot; Rob  Roy &quot;  in  &quot; Forward &quot; both attempt to allay  the  fears of the alarmists.  &quot;Rob Roy&quot; points out that cost of living has been freely used by  Labour for some years past as the basis of arguments for increased wages. He stresses the fact that in such things as  these much  depends on details  of interpretation.  &quot; How such agreements are interpreted will depend on economic and political circumstances in general,, and Labour is strong enough, or has means within its reach to make itself strong enough, to see that the interpretation is of the right kind.&quot;  Mr. R. B. Suthers, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot;See last week&apos;s Eeport, p. 37.
suggests that the fall of wages on a decrease in the cost of living is a necessary corollary of their increase when the cost of living is rising.  He points out that there is no need forthe cost of living to be determined by food prices alone.  He advances the argument thatsliding scale agreements  have the considerable  advantage of  clearing the ground  ofindustrial discontent due  to changes in the value of money,  and that such agreementsfacilitate rather than prevent negotiations for the improvement of what may be termed&quot; real wages.&quot;   It is  curious to  observe how detached these discussions are from thepractical details of the situation.  There is no specific reference to the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot;index number,  though a  reference to the  &quot; official Board of Trade figures &quot; made  byMr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; should perhaps be interpreted as a referenceto the &quot; Labour Gazette.&quot; Last  week the &quot; Nation &quot;  in an article otherwise unworthyof notice  made use of the &quot;Economist&quot;  index number.  This  action has  apparentlymade some of the contributors to  these papers aware for the first time of the existence ofthe &quot; Economist&quot; index  number.  In  &quot; Forward &quot; an anonymous contributor arguesfrom it that the railwaymen&apos;s new rates  of pay are not  as good as the pre-war rates, andMr. Philip Snowden thinks the difference between the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; and &quot; Econo-mist &quot; figures shows the need of an inquiry in order to obtain &quot;  reliable facts.&quot;Government Policy.    The  housing problem is discussed in the &quot; Democrat &quot; and. the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot;Mr. R. J. Da vies,-in the  &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; is sympathetic  to  the  proposals of the manchester Building Guild Committee.  He  fears, however, that it will not be able  to overcome the obstacles it may meet with in its immediate operations, and suggests that theso-called &quot; direct labour &quot;  plan is the more practicable policy for municipalities to adopt.                            PART IV. GENERAL TOPICS. The General Situation.     Evidence  has  accumulated  during   the week that  the recent  pause in  the development of the great questions in Avhich Labour is at present vitally interested will be followed within the next few weeks by events  of the first importance.  The issue on which developments on a large scale are likely to occur is the nationalisation of the mines. The present campaign of educational propaganda, which is  now being prosecuted with increased vigour and determination, comes to an end on the 8th February, and indications are now being given of the procedure which Labour  may adopt  on its  conclusion. Mr. Hodges&apos; statements on the  matter are referred to below.  But  the  nationalisation issue is complicated by the fresh demands which the miners  advanced in  their interview with the Premier on the 28th January, and the whole question of  policy  with regard to the mines will be discussed in the next few days by the Miners&apos; Federation, the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades  Union  Congress,  in  preparation for the action to be taken in Parliament and  at the special Trades Union Congress.  In view of this, the question of the respective merits of industrial and political action is again being discussed ; and in this connection it is of some interest to note that a convention of the rank and file movement has been  summoned to take place previous to  and during the Congress in order to make clear the policy of the rank and file in regard to the questions which the Congress will discuss&quot;.   As  this convention has been  called  on the  initiative of the National Administrative Council of Shop  Stewards&apos; and  Workers&apos; Committees, its influence will be in the direction of extreme action., Survey of Industrial Disputes.     From the standpoint of industrial dispute, the present situation is more tranquil than it has been for many weeks.  The ironmoulders&apos;  strike has been brought to an end through the acceptance by a majority of the men of the terms agreed upon at the recent conference, and a threatened lock-out in the sheet metal trade  has been  averted by the decision of the men to remove an embargo with regard to the payment for overtime anjl the handling of repairs.  At the moment the  only stoppages of work of any importance are those due to local disputes at Swansea, where the engineers employed in ship-repairing yards have struck to enforce a demand for a weekly minimum wage of   5, and at Glasgow, where the employees of the Subway Railway  are still  on strike.  An early settlement of the latter dispute is expected, but the former will probably prove more difficult, owing to the fact that, as is pointed out below, local variations in different trades are  involved.
The most important demand which has been made during the week is that of the national transport Workers&apos; Federation for an advance of 10s. per week in the wages of all adultroad transport  workers, with the exception of tramway and omnibus drivers and con-ductors.  The discussion of  this question is expected to proceed on the lines of amicab lenegotiation between the parties concerned.Unemployment.    The increase in unemployment as indicated by the employment exchange registrationsis much smaller this week.   During the week ended the 16th January, the number of ex-Service  men and women on out-of-work  donation  increased by  3,349, bringing  thetotal  to 396,495.  Of this  number, 39,124 were  drawing donation  under the  specialextension scheme.   Also 4,393 H.M.F. short-time policies were lodged at the 9th January,which is considerably less than  during the previous week.  Engineering and allied tradesstill show increasing unemployment, but the position in the building trade has considerably improved since last week.    The number of civilians on unemployment insurance benefit has increased this week,following the reduction noted last week.  The number now stands at 135,326.    The increment in the live  register  at January 16th is  not large, the figures being501,743  men,  51,541  women  and  29,971  juveniles.  The  increase  in  unemploymentindicated by these figures is considerably less than was recorded during the two previousweeks.Industrial Courts Act.    The Court of Inquiry,  appointed by the Minister, into the  claim of the national transport Workers&apos;  Federation for a standard minimum  wage and  other  alterations inthe conditions  of employment of  dock and waterside labour, held a preliminary meetingon the  22nd January.  Lord Shaw presided over a full meeting of the court.  It wasdecided that a  general rule of publicity of proceedings should apply to the inquiry.  Theprocedure of the court was determined, and it was decided that an opening statement should be made by Mr. Bevin on behalf of the transport workers, to be followed immediately by an opening statement on behalf of  the  employers.   The respective  parties  willthereafter lead their evidence.   The next  meeting  of the  court will be held  ont he3rd February.    The Court  of Inquiry into the hours  of coal tippers and trimmers will begin its sittingsat Cardiff on the 4th February.   As Mr. Rigby Swift,  K.C., is unable to  continue to actas chairman of this  court, the Minister  has appointed  Mr. J.  A. Compston, K.C., in his place.    The Minister  has appointed  Sir William Robinson and the Rt.  Hon. Sir DunbarPlunket Barton, Bart.,  K.C., to be additional chairmen of the Industrial  Court.Hours of Employment (No. 2) Bill.    The campaign of the Seafarers&apos; Joint Council against the exclusion of seamen fromthis Bill continues.    With regard to the question  of the  inclusion of agriculture, Major Wood, M.P., in a speech at the annual dinner  of the Doncaster Farmers&apos;  Union, insisted that the variety of&apos;conditions  affecting agriculture renders elasticity of working hours necessary, and that a -means of securing this elasticity of working hours directly on  the day, and on the farm,between the farmer and his own men, is essential.   He thought that some such arrangement might be obtained by agreement, and he asked farmers to reflect whether they  should insist on the total exclusion of agriculture and bar the door to any possibility of agreement.Two letters in  the current issue of the &quot; Mark Lane Express,&quot; an organ  of the National.Farmers&apos; Union, suggest that the farmer&apos;s strongest objection to the inclusion of agriculture in this Bill  is the fear that  he would be deprived of the right of individual contract with.his workers as  to  overtime.Nationalisation of the Mines.    The present campaign in favour of the nationalisation of the mines  will end on the -8th February, and every effort is being made by the miners to inspire the final propagandawith  enthusiasm.  During the week meetings have been addressed by Mr. F. Hodges atDoncaster  and Darwen; Mr. Smillie at Dundee, Aberdeen,  Perth, Bolton  and Oldham;Mr. Brace at Cwmbran and Llanbradach;  Mr.  Noah Ablett at Garndiffarth; Mr. W..Thorne and Sir Leo Money at  Canning Townr; and Mr. H.  Smith at Penistone.
     The procedure which the miners intend to adopt on the conclusion of their campaign is now becoming clear.  Mr. Frank Hodges has stated that the Labour Party will move an amendment to the King&apos;s Speech demanding that the mines should become the property of the nation.  If, as is expected, this amendment is rejected, the special Trades Union Congress will then be summoned and will be asked to decide what action should be taken. Mr. Hodges has expressed the opinion that if the Congress decides to ascertain the  views of the rank and file of the Labour movement on the question of direct action, the Govern- ment  will be  forced to dissolve Parliament and to fight an election on the issue.   In that event he had no doubt of the result.   It is of some  interest to note that Mr. H. Smith, the president of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, in his speech at Penistone, announced that the miners were not anxious for direct action,  and asserted that direct action was suicidal, and  if the working man would only record his vote there would be no need for it.  Mr. Smith&apos;s policy may perhaps be affected by the exhaustion of funds caused by the Yorkshire strike.     In South Wales it is  reported that the nationalisation campaign has  taken a new turn.   Some of the local leaders are declaring that the increased output of coal is having a prejudicial effect on the nationalisation campaign, and they therefore advise the miners to reduce their expenditure of energy and to produce less coal.     It is reported that further pressure is being brought to bear upon the miners&apos; leaders, not only from South Wales but also from Scotland, Yorkshire and the Midlands, to demand a substantial increase in wages unless steps are  taken by the Government to deal with mine-owners&apos;  profits.  This was one of the questions raised by the deputation  from the M.F.G.B. which met the Premier on the 28th inst.     The Miners&apos; Federation is preparing for any eventuality by continuing its  policy of absorbing all  classes  of workers employed in and aroundvthe pits.   It  has recently been negotiating with various sectional bodies of craftsmen with a view to their affiliation with it.  The National Union of Cokemen and By-Product  Workers has already taken this step.   The National Federation of Colliery Examiners&apos;, Deputies&apos;, and Firemen&apos;s Associa- tions, which includes  district  bodies in nearly all the coalfields, is discussing a proposal; of its Midland District for affiliation with the M.F.G.B., and in South Wales a provisional agreement has been  reached  between  the South Wales  Miners&apos;  Federation  and  the Enginemen,  Stokers&apos;, and  Surveyor Craftsmen&apos;s  Association.  It  is  reported  that  the Federation is also negotiating with a view to the affiliation of the Welsh mining clerical workers&apos; guild. The Miners and the Coal Situation.     On the 28th January a deputation of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain was received by the Prime Minister, accompanied by Mr.  Bonar Law and  the President of the Board of  Trade, and an application was made by the Miners&apos; Federation for Govem- ment action in  relation to certain points.  These were the enormous increase in the price of exported coal, the high price of industrial coal for  home  consumers, the shortage of domestic coal, the effect  of the continued high price of coal on the cost  of living, and an application by  the Federation for an immediate and considerable reduction in the price of industrial  coal, followed by Government action to reduce  the  cost of commodities produced in factories, &amp;c, or alternatively, the consideration by the Government of  an application by  the Federation for an advance  in wages consequent  on  the high cost of living.   The Prime Minister stated that the report of the independent accountant employed by the Government to investigate the financial position of the industry,  and the estimate given in the House of Commons on the 14th July, 1919, would be ready within a week, and after the Federation had had an opportunity of examining the figures, they could meet the Prime Minister to discuss the bearing  of the figures on the points which they raised. The deputation agreed to adopt the proposal of the Prime Minister. Railwaymen.     Although resolutions unfavourable to the recent  settlement have, been  passed  by some local branches of the N.U.R., discontent among the railwaymen at present appears to be felt chiefly by the railway clerks.   Local branches have passed a number of resolutions expressing their dissatisfaction that the revised rates  of  pay agreed upon  last  August have not yet  been put into force.   A meeting  took place on the 23rd January between&apos; representatives  of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, the National Union of Railwaymen and the committee of railway managers  appointed to deal with the  classifications of various  salaried positions in the railway service.  Numerous practical difficulties that had- emerged in connection with the work were explained.  A definite assurance was given  by
 the railway managers that the new classifications, which are proving a matter of great- difficulty, especially on the smaller railways, will be completed, and the full terms of the settlement in regard to the clerical staff will  be put into operation not  later than  the 1st March by means of a special  pay sheet.     Mr. A. G. Walkden,  the General Secretary of the R.C.A., in an interview with a &quot; Daily Herald &quot; representative, stated that the whole progress of the negotiations pointed to the desirability of the nationalisation of the railways as the  multiplication of systems made  it  impossible to  deal  speedily or fairly with  the  question of classification.  The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; gives day by day accounts of the discontent in  the branches and foretells a strike of all the railway clerks in the United Kingdom unless the Government carries out the promise to have the settlement put into operation by the 1st March. Wimbledon and Aston (Birmingham)  branches demand  that the recent 10  per cent, increase in the-Civil Service bonus should also apply to railway clerks. Amalgamation.     The question  of the  amalgamation, which  has  been previously referred to in this Report,  between the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, and the National Warehousemen and General Workers&apos; Union and the Amal- gamated Union of  Co-operative and Commercial Employees was discussed  on  the  18th January at a special conference.   Mr.  C. W. Bowerman, M.P.,  was present to represent the Trades Union  Congress.  Much consideration was given to a clause in the proposals put  forward  by the Joint  Committee,  according to  which, without prejudice to  the existing membership of the three organisations, any person of either sex employed wholly or mainly in  any commercial occupation in connection with the retail or wholesale trades would  be eligible for membership.  Several delegates expressed  the fear that an amalga- mation of the unions in accordance with this clause would result in the formation of a General Workers&apos; Union. Mr. Bowerman gave the opinion of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress,  and stated that his committee desired  to  see the completion of the amalgamation, but they wished the unions to be careful that they did not place them- selves in a position to conflict with other unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. In accordance with this, the  Conference agreed to add to the clause a provision that the decisions of the annual conference of  the amalgamation in respect of the admission of allied Avorkers should be in accord with the Trades Union Congress and any authority set up to deal with demarcation disputes. It was further agreed that the Parliamentary Committee should be asked to summon appointed representatives of the three organisations with a view to furthering the amalgamation. The difficulties in the way of this amalgamation owing  to the peculiar position of the A.U.C.E., have already been referred to in this Report.     It is reported that  the Printing and Kindred  Trades Federation is  endeavouring to- reconstitute  an Amalgamation Committee to  take up  the question of  amalgamation where it broke down after the last attempt.   It is not considered probable that immediate progress will be made in this  effort.  It is understood, however,  that more success is attending the negotiations for amalgamation which are taking place between the National Union  of Printing  and Paper Workers (the  unskilled union) and the National  Union of&quot; Book Binders and Machine  Rulers. Overtime. ^  It is reported  that the  National  Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association  has decided to reconsider its attitude  towards overtime.  For over a year it has prohibited members from working overtime, with the result that awkward situations have occurred owing to the  fact that its members were not allowed by this rule to work on jobs  on which other trade  unionists were  working overtime.  In  view of the  difficulties that have occurred, the Executive Council of the Association has decided to take a vote of  its members  on  t\e following question :  &quot; Shall branches or districts where there are  no unemployed and men cannot be got from elsewhere have local  autonomy with  power to decide  each case of  requested overtime from an employer on its  merits and to allow over- time with what safeguards may be considered necessary ? &quot; The Welsh Tinplate Trade.     As was announced in last week&apos;s Report, the Joint Industrial Council for this trade has conceded an advance in wages of 40 per cent, in response to the workers&apos; demand for an advance of 50 per cent.  The claim of the workers for this advance was based not onthe high cost of living,  but  on the abnormal prices ruling  for  tinplates.  The  prices of.
Welsh tinplates have recently increased, owing largely to the enormous demand and to-absence  of competition due to industrial troubles  in the United States, to the recordfigure of 64s. per box.   This is four or five times the price in 1914.   It was only natural,therefore, that the workmen should claim and obtain a share of the large profits whichthese prices are yielding.   At the same time, this very large increase in wages is likelyto unsettle  other  grades of labour in Wales, and to precipitate other claims for  wageadvances.  The unsettling effect of this award has, indeed, already been seen.  For sometime in various industries in South Wales engineers  have been agitating for  a minimum wage of   5  per week.   In some cases  settlements have already been reached, but in the-ship-repairing trade the question is still at issue.  Numerous conferences have taken placelocally and in London, and in the end it was  agreed that an offer of 98s. per week shouldbe placed before the men.   It appeared likely that this offer would be accepted, when the advance  in the tinplate industry was granted.   This advance caused the wage  of engineers.employed in that industry to rise to  5 14s. Qd. * In view of this, the engineers employedin the ship-repairing yards in the tinplate district have stopped work as a protest againstthe delay in granting their  5 demand.   This is a good example of the complications whichresult from  district variations produced by the regulation of wages on the basis of theprices  of products.Absorption of  Unemployed in the Cotton Trade.    An agreement between the  Oldham Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association, Ltd., andthe  Oldham  Operative  Cotton Spinners&apos; Provincial Association  with  regard  to the reinstatement of spinners and joiner spinners on returning to civil life  was ratified at ajoint meeting  of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations and the Spinners&apos;Amalgamation at  Manchester on the  9th January.   In order that spinners  at presentunemployed may be absorbed in the trade it was agreed that as far as practicable two-out-of-work spinners or joiner spinners shall be taken on to replace each three female:creelers.   This occupation  shall  be considered temporary until  there is an opportunityto find them ordinary work or a pair of mules.   The two men shall divide the three creelers&apos;wages, and if  the wages so  divided do not reach  3 3s. for each man, the difference shallbe paid by the employer.  As many of the creelers  were formerly card-room hands,  anattempt  will be made to induce those displaced to enter the card-room and thus assist.in starting more preparatory  machines.May Day Celebrations.    Great preparations are being made by  Labour for  the celebrations to  be held  onMay Day.  At a meeting of the London Joint Advisory Council of Trade Unionists andCo-operators,  it was decided that the  celebrations on May Day should be organised  bya  Joint  Committee  of Co-operators, Trade Unionists and the Labour Party.  Further-arrangements  for the celebrations throughout the country are to be made by a delegatemeeting of representatives of  Trade Unionists and Co-operators, which will be held on the-8th February.  An executive committee has already been appointed.Housing.    Further developments have taken place with regard to the scheme of  the ManchesterBuilding Guild Committee, an account of which was given in last week&apos;s Report.  A meeting;of the Manchester district  and branch  committees of the building trade unions, held inManchester on the 20th inst.,  discussed the scheme and passed a resolution approving of.the building of artisans&apos; houses  under the auspices  of the  Building  Guild  Committee,.pledging the support of the unions represented, and agreeing, to the nomination and election of a direct representative of each trade union to the Guild Committee.   It  was further-decided to hold a mass meeting of building trade operatives, and  other arrangements weremade to bring the scheme before the rank and file of  the membership of the  trade union.branches.    Representatives of the  Guild  Committee have  interviewed the  Chairman of the  &apos;Urban District Council of Irlam, eight miles south-west of Manchester, and the architect,.  &apos;surveyor  and clerk, and have made definite proposals  which are  being considered  bythe Council.   The Committee  offer to find the labour necessary for the Councifs housingschemes  on condition that the Council pays the wages bill plus -10 per cent, for overheadcharges,  engagement of technical  staff, &amp;c.  The  Council is to  buy the materials and supply them to the operatives.    (C 1957)                                                                 H
      In connection with this scheme it is interesting to note that the question of  the  employment of direct labour on housing schemes has recently been considered by many  Town Councils and  Urban  District Councils.  It is announced  that the Birmingham  City Council has approved, the local housing Committee&apos;s scheme for the erection of about  500 houses by direct labour, and the Thurnscoe Urban District  Council have secured  the  consent of the Ministry of Health to the employment of direct labour in connection with  their housing scheme.  On the other hand, at a meeting of Doncaster Town Council,  a proposal to use direct labour was defeated.      It is  not yet. clear hoAv precisely the Manchester Guild scheme will materialise, but,  according to the original plan, it clearly differs from the proposals  for the employment of  direct labour.  Under the Guild (Scheme, the trade unions are to employ architects and other  persons who  are not themselves members of the unions.   In this connection it should be  noted, however, that  proposals for  extending trade unionism in  the building  industry  with a view  to the inclusion of  architects have recently been discussed.   The architects&apos;  assistants and architects&apos; draughtsmen  have  recently organised into a provisional union  of their own.      The Executive Council of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society has passed an important  resolution on the question of  dilution in the  building industry.  This resolution declares  that the proportion of bricklayers engaged in the bricklaying industry in 1914 was 40  per  cent., which  was sufficient to meet the demand, and further states that, assuming that  50 per cent, of the bricklayers at present in the country were engaged in building houses,  and assuming that one bricklayer builds six  houses  in one year, 51,500 houses could be  produced  in  excess of the  Government  demand for  the year.  It  is therefore concluded  that dilution is unnecessary.   The  Council  has made a  series  of six demands :- (1) A  guaranteed full week  for  all operatives engaged upon housing ;   (2)  every bricklayer  compulsorily retained in the Army or Navy to be demobilised at once ;  (3) non-essential  building to be.suspended and the Building Trade Unions to appoint half the members of  tribunals set  up to control the Priority Scheme ; (4)  the rent of any cottage or flat under  the housing scheme not to exceed 10s.  per week ;  (5) the Rents  Restriction Act to  be  extended until the supply of houses is equal to the demand ; and  (6) in the event of the  supply of  labour being insufficient  to meet the need, the question of permitting overtime  upon housing schemes only should be considered.  A preliminary condition to this, how-  ever, is that every  man in the industry must be employed.  Trade Unionism among Salaried Workers.     It is reported  that a conference  of  various professional associations is to be  held in London on the  7th February for the  purpose  of forming a &quot; National Federation  of Professional,  Technical, Administrative, and  Managerial Associations.&quot;   This federation is  being  formed in order  to strengthen the economic position  of  these professional associations.  It is understood that its objects will include the establishment of friendly relations between the unions of all grades of employed, persons and the claim to a share in the control of their industries.  It may be expected that  if this federation is  formed it will strengthen the position of these  unions, the development of which for the most part is recent.   Some of the associations catering for professional and technical staffs are the Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen, which in the last five years has enrolled about  90  per  cent,  of the  persons eligible for membership, the Society  of Technical Engineers, the Shipbuilding, Engineering and Iron and Steel Commercial Staffs Association, the  Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association, and the  Association of Super- vising Electricians.   The movement  to  organise has  also grown in a marked fashion  in the case of bank officials and law clerks. Insurance  workers, such as agents  and clerks, have long been organised in the case  of industrial assurance companies, but a very rapid extension of the movement has recently been taking place, and the new Guild of Insurance Officials  is rapidly organising the staffs of  the non-industrial companies.   The staff employees  of architects, accountants and surveyors, have also recently formed associations of their  own.  The associations  of civil servants  and teachers are growing, and such organisations  as the National Union  of Clerks  and the National  Amalgamated Union  of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen  and  Clerks,  which were already in existence before the war, have developed in a striking way. Rank and File Movement.     The National Administrative Council of Shop Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committees,in conjunction with the Scottish Workers&apos; Committee, the  London Workers&apos;  Committee^nd the South Wales Unofficial Reform  Committee, has summoned a convention of the
  rank and file movement.  This will be  held  the  day before the special  Trades  Union  Congress, which is to meet in February, and will meet every evening during the Congress.  The object of this convention is to watch the proceedings of the Congress and to make  clear the policy of the rank and file in regard to  the questions which the Congress will  discuss.  This is a very interesting development of the rank and file movement.  It will  be remembered that at the recent conference of Shop Stewards&apos; and Workers&apos; Committees,  the subjects discussed were for the most  part the same as those which the Trades Union  Congress had dealt with, except that in each case  the shop stewards went a step further  in their treatment of the  problems.  The rank and file movement by means of these  conferences apparently intends to &quot; ginger up &quot; the constitutional machinery of the labour  movement.  Co-partnership  and Profit Sharing.      Several co-partnership and profit sharing schemes have recently  been  announced.  Messrs. Rolls-Royce, Ltd., have recommended that the workers should be allowed to  subscribe for and hold  during employment with the company shares of a special class .to be called Workers&apos; Shares ; the worker to pay for  them at par by instalments, and on  leaving the  company,  selling  them to the company&apos;s nominees also  at par.  In other  respects the shares will have the same rights as ordinary shares.      The Friary Brewery Company,  Guildford, has  instituted a pension and  insurance  scheme which will be confined to  those  of its employees who do not belong to a trade  union.      Messrs.  George Richards  &amp; Co., Ltd., machine tool makers, Broadheath, Altrincham,  have devised a profit-sharing scheme.  According to this, after  taking  from the profits  an amount equal to 7f per cent, of the present-day valuation of the business, the remainder -of the  profits will ,be divided equally between the shareholders and  the workpeople.  Opportunity is to be given to the employees to invest their bonus in shares in the company,  upon which the directors guarantee a dividend of 1\ per cent.      A profit-sharing scheme has also been introduced by Mr. J. C. Cameron, baker, Montrose.  According to this, 10 per cent, of  the net profits will be divided between the bakehouse  employees and  shop assistants in the proportion of 5 per cent, in an equal division, and  5  per cent, on the basis of wages earned.      It is announced that at a meeting of the National Council of the Commercial Motor  Users&apos; Association, Inc.,  which will be held on the 4th February, a discussion will take  place on co-partnership  and profit-sharing schemes in relation to the road  transport  industry.  Russia.              \      A long manifesto has been issued by  a group of Trade Union officials  and Labour men  representing the moderate  opinion of the Labour movement as an attempt to state the  reasons which prompt them to support the policy of  complete and immediate peace with  the Russian Government.  They deplore the secret diplomatic decisions which  are taken  with respect to Russia,  maintain  that the Soviet Government appears by the course of-  events to represent the will of  the Russian people, and intimate that  they will do their  best to oppose Britain&apos;s entrance into any war that diplomatic intrigues may give rise to.  The manifesto is signed by Messrs. T. Ashton, C. W. Bowerman, W. Brace, J. T.  Brownlie,.  J. R. Clynes, F. W. Goldstone, F. Hall,  W.&apos; Hudson, W. H. Hutchinson,  J. W. Ogden,  W. F. Purdy, T. Shaw, A. G. Walkden and R. Young.  Trade Union Topics.     Amalgamated  Society of  General Tool Makers and Machinists. The organiser for;  Scotland of. this Union complains that managers take every opportunity of dismissing active shop stewards, and alleges that if a shop  steward makes a mistake in his work he is sure to be dismissed, whereas a similar fault on the part  of any other workman would probably be overlooked.  A case is cited which occurred at  the Caledon Motor Works,  where the firm refused absolutely to reinstate  a shop steward,  and with reference to this the demand is  made for  something more  than  an agreement with  employers  for the recognition of shop stewards.     National  Uniow of Boot and Shoe  Operatives. The Rushden Branch of this Union has decided  to  introduce shops committees into  the  boot  and shoe industry in  that district.  .
     Union of Post Office Workers. In view  of  the  absorption into this  Union of thePostmen&apos;s Federation, the Postal and. Telegraph Clerks&apos; Association, the Fawcett Associa-tion, the Tube Staff Association, the Central London Postmen, the London Postal Portersand the London Postal Bagmen, and the negotiations which are being conducted by other small associations with a view to similar fusion, the National Joint Committee of PostOffice Associations has now held a meeting at which it was  decided to dissolve.  Thereare thus now in existence only three important bodies of Postal Workers, i.e., the Unionof Post Office Workers,  the Post  Office Engineering Union and the Federation of PostOffice Supervising Officers.    The National Union of Clerks. With reference to the account  given in this Report,page 26, of guild organisation  within the National Union of Clerks, it may be noted thatMr. Clement Stott, No.  1 Administrative Area, National Union of Clerks, has pointedout that the engineering  clerks in the N.U.C. are at the moment being grouped nationallyon an industrial basis and a conference of engineering  clerks from all parts of the country will shortly  be  held in Manchester to give effect  to this  policy.  Similar conferences arebeing arranged for the various sections which constitute the N.U.C.  It is pointed outthat an advantage which this  system of organisation possesses over  a federation of guildsis a common fighting fund and a  central direction of policy  with the further advantage that each member has the privilege of discussing and  determining matters peculiar tohis own employment.Ex-Service Men.                             -f    Ex-Service  Men  on the Land. Considerable  progress is  reported in the settlementof ex-Service men on the land under the Land Settlement Facilities Act, 1919: 24,921ex-Service men have applied  for  429,697 acres ;  of these 15,008 have been approved for251,568 acres.   County Councils have already acquired or agreed to acquire 151,548 acres.The Isle of Ely Council claims to have settled the largest number, 606 persons being settledon 3,155 acres.
