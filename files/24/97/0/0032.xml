5SECRETJii!UPiS^             Property*tRJXX-3^^e line.From Viceroy, 29th January 1920.        (Received 2 p.m.)^^^^^l^g S.  Letter from Amir to His Majesty the King Emperor, dated 14th January,v    was  handed in by Afghan envoy on 27th.  Letter, which  is couched in courteous     terms, may be summarised as follows : &quot; After appropriate  compliments.&apos;&apos; Although.     1 have  not yet received reply to my letter of 10th  September 19.19, I have  not  lost     hope, and being desirous of hearing from  Your Majesty, I address friendly letter.     On this  occasion I wish to invite attention to the subject of Islamic world which     concerns  Great  Britain  more  than  all  other  Governments.   Claims of  friendly     relations require  me to say question of Khilafat is matter  concerning .MahOmedaps     themselves,  and nobody else has right, by virtue  of  religion, to interfere  with it.     Likewise,v..it has been recognised for live centuries that Holy  Places, according to     Islamic law should not be removed from the &quot;control .of the Khilalat.  When destiny     has placed the control of the whole world  under Great Powers, not only material  but     spiritual  welfare of human  beings should be considered- by them, otherwise the  war     and  bloodshed will  continue.  Men cling everywhere  to  their peculiar  religious     beliefs, and if  true regard is  paid to (? raising) of  mankind,&apos; more than  300 million     Mahomedans will be tranquillised.  Afghanistan feels with the rest of the Mussalmaii     world in  its sorrow  and concern over this question, and I share the opinion of all     Mussalmans with regard to upholding of  the  Islamic Khilafat  and  non removal of     Holy Places from its control.&quot;          Woods used  for &quot; Holy  Places&quot; indicates shrines outside Hedjaz,  such as     Baghdad, Jerusalem and  Damascus are included. Letter is obviously political  move.     It might be advisable forme to  inform Amir at  once that his  letter is being lorwarded     to the King, and delay consideration of reply until ten our of the A mi r&apos;s answer to my:     letter of 17th January is known.
