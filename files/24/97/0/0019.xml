               INCREASE OF RENT AND MORTGAGE INTEREST /         L.G.19\r\ts^^              (&quot;VAR RESTRICTIONS) ACTS. &apos;         ^Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and the Minister of Health.Sff          The Acts now In force are the following:-          (1) The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest              (War Restrictions) Act, 1915;          (2) Tho Increase of Rent, and Mortgage Interest              (Restrictions)  Act, 1919; (passed 2nd April 1919);          (3) The Increase of Rent &amp;c*  Amendment Act, 1919,              (passed 23rd December, 1919),  The Increase&apos;-of              Rent &amp;c* Amendment Act 1918 has been wholly              repealed by the second Act of 1919c          The first Act of 1919 amended the principal Act (l)by c::tending the provisions of the principal Act to higherrented houses, and (2) by extending the period of operation ofthe principal Act to Lady Day 1921.   In addition the firstAct of 1919 authorised the increase of 10 per cent on thestandard rent and of f per cent (in addition to the 5 per cent)on the interest on mortgages, but while these increases applyimmediately in the case of the higher rented houses to which that  -Act was made applicable they do not apply to houses to -which the                  edoriginal Act appli/till the expiration of six months after thetermination of the War.   The second Act of 1919 repealed all theprovisions in the earlier Acts as to the conditions upon whichOrders for possession and ejectment orders might be made andenacted new provisions which are to be in force until the 1stof July, 1920.          The present position therefore is that the provisions in the Acts which limit the rents of houses to which the Actsapply and those which restrict the rate of interest on mortgagesand prevent the calling in of mortgages continue in force untilLady Day 1921, but the provisions which limit the making cf ordersfor possession or ejectment orders will expire on the 1st July 1920,          It is too much to hope that the&apos; shortage in housing accommodation will have been overtaken by the 1st of July next*
           A  serious  position Fill therefore arise  if all the    provisions  for  the  protection of  tenants against eviction    are  allowed to  lapse  on  that date.    On the  other hand  all    restrictions  on houso rent  operate  adversely upon the general    housing question  (1)  by  discouraging  private enterprise in    house buildings and (2)  by  increasing the  deficit of the State    assisted  housing  schemes through  keeping down the general level    of rcuts.           A  Committee  was appointed  in April  1918  under the    Chairmanship of Lord  Hunter with  the  following  terms of reference,    - to consider the legislation embodied in  the Increase  of Rent    and Mortgage Interest (War  Restrictions) Act 1915 as amended  in    relation  to the housing  of  the  working classes  after the War    and to recommend  what steps,  if any,  should be  taken to remove    any difficulties  which may  arise  in connection  therewith.    This Committee reported&apos; in  December 1918  and some of  their    recommendations were  adopted  in framing the Bill for the first    Act of 1919*  It  is submitted,  however,  that the whole  subject    required  reconsideration in the light of tho present  position and    it is suggested that  a new  Committee  should bo  appointed for  this    purpose.    The terms  of  reference to  the proposed Committee might    be &quot;to consider tho operation of the  Rent Restriction  Acts  and to    advise that steps should be taken in  regard to  the  continuation or    amendment of those Acts&quot;.   With regard to the constitution  of the    Committee,  it is  suggested  that it should consist  of  (1) a    representative of tho landlords (2) a County Court  Judge (3)  a    Labour member, and (4) two  nominees of the Ministry of Health.    Legislation of some kind will certainly be necessary  and as such    legislation must be passed&quot; before the 1st July, the date on which    the last Act lapses there is  no time  to be lost,                                            Birkcnhead.                                            C.Addison.1.1920,.
