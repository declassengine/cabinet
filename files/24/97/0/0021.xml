BLACK   SEA.        The general situation remains  critical, but not quite  soalarming.  The  Bolsheviks are being held  on the Don Front, butfuture&apos; attitude  of Cossacks  is  doubtful.  They are demandingconcessions from Denikin, and if negotiations fail, it will meangeneral retirement on Novorossisk and,  later, evacuation toCrimea/
Crimea, if still open.  Ghenichesk-1ms been&apos;lost and Bolsheviksare approaching Crimea along railway via Perekop, this  linocan be held if troops will, fight.   At Odessa, there is  no immediate alarm, but General Schilling, tho Volunteer ArmyCommander-, is apathetic and not trusted by British Officersthere.:-      - &apos; *&quot;  &apos;                                 ;  &quot;        The question of evacuation under Mr.  Mackinder^guarantee is likely to become a serious problem, as 50,000 mayhave to be provided for from Novorossisk, Crimea and Odessa.The condition of the sick and wounded is appalling. He&apos;  medicalstores, no warm clothing, and no sanitary conditions.        Commander-in-Chief,- Mediterranean, and General  OfficerCommanding, Army of Black Sea, suggest that a definition ofpolicy is of utmost Importance, as Denikin is beginning to mis-trust British policy and to question British willingness tocontinue to help.   They suggest local garrisons of a battalionat Novorossisk and Odessa.   Troops to assisfactually  holdingCrimea.  Navy to take over Caspian Fleet and Baku to be occupiedby Army.  Batoum Garrison to be retained.  This would enable  theRussian Army to re-organise and undertake new offensive inSpring.  Very similar suggestions were placed on record two weeks ago as Admiralty view of. steps to be taken to control situation.&quot;        Of the ships at Nikolaev the following have been towedto Odessa    Light Cruiser &quot;ADMIRAL NAKHIMOFF , Transport &quot;DON&quot;,Seaplane Carrier&quot;FODESSE&quot;, Destroyers &quot;ZANTE&quot;, and &quot;TCERIGO&quot;AND Submarines &quot;LEBED&quot; and &quot;PELIKAN&quot;.

Two French tugs have proceeded fromSulina to Nikolaev to do any further towing required.  the admiral has protested against detention of s.s.  &quot;CHRISTIAN NEBE&quot;at Malta, and Foreign Office has telegraphed to High commissioner at Constantinople that some arrangement must be made to landthese Prisoners of War at Odessa or some other port.  War office have been informed that Admiralty are strongly averse to anyproposal for assisting the Caspian Fleet by British personnelif it remains under Russian Control, also that Admiralty arenot prepared to send naval personnel to Caspian unless Baku is held by British troops and the security of the Batoum;- Bakuline is guaranteed by the military.        Commander-in-Chief was informed on 19th  January that all arrangements RSPJR made for taking over ships  in  the Caspian.were to remain  In abeyance for, the present,  also that the medicalstaff, though detailed,  will not  leave England  in view of this,and also of War Office decision that Russian wounded will notbe evacuated to Malta.

A strike of office and shop assistants commenced onJanuary 20th.

TURKEY.        The following extracts are from a report by the political officer attached to the Staff of the Commander-in-Chief,.Mediterranean                 Recent Bolshevik successes are likely to give an.        Impetus to the Bolshevik aim to turn the Moslem world:   &apos;        against the British Empire..                 No principles are more fundamentally Incompatible        than those of Bolshevism and Islam, yet determined attempts        are being made In Turkey, Trans-Caucasia, Syria and        Arabia to delude the Moslem world into believing that  itf        would do well to ally itself with Bolshevism in its war  y        against the British Empire..                 By skilful mis-interpretation and distortion large        numbers of Moslems in the Near and Middle East have been        led to believe that Great Britain is the enemy of Islam.                 The despatch: of the Greeks to Smyrna with iis  V        deplorable results, has been a useful and mush used    &apos;        argument.                 The delay in concluding peace with Turkey has        produced the Nationalist Movement and the resurrection        of the Committee of Union and Progress..                 The vague and. unformed aims of the Pan-Islamic        Movement are being turned into anti-British channels  and        Great Britain, until recently regarded by Moslems as  their        principal  protector,  is being, made to appear in the        contrary light.                 Mustapha Kemal is reported to be summoning a Panr        Islamic  conference at Sivas with deputies from Persia,        India  and Afghanistan.  If this conference meets it will        no doubt indulge in much ant ^British propaganda.                           MOROCCO.Tangier.  .        The orders  as  to keeping a destroyer in readiness toproceed to Tangier have been  cancelled.
