(THIS DOCUMENT tS THE PROPERTY Of HIS BRITAMIC MAJESTY18 GOVERMMT).S g C R E T.r-&quot;*              CABINET.i p -594,    -THE  EVACUATION  OF  BATOUM.              Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign              IHairs.        &quot;    &quot;                           &apos;                During my absence abroad a decision was arrived at           by the Cabinet to withdraw the comparatively small British           foroe that has hitherto been maintained at Batoum.   I           believe that this decision was justified by Military           reasons the desirability of strengthening General Milners           forces at Constantinople, in view of  the situation there,           and the reoent action of General Franchet D&apos;Esperey..                The political consequences of ,this step at the present           moment can hardly, I think, have be,en fully appreciated.                                                              4            They will, in my judgment, be disastrous.                We have just committed ourselves to the recognition           of the 55 Caucasian States of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan;            and are about to supply them with arms, munitions and           supplies and assist them in the struggle for their            independence with which they aro threatened.                That we should choose  this moment of all others to           withdraw our small force from Batoum  will be regarded as            an aot of ietrayal    by these Communities and will bring            to the ground with a orash  the edifice which we and they            have been at so muoh pains  to rear.                Mr. Wardrop from Tiflis telegraphs his dismay and            implores re-consideration.   Admiral  de Robeok telegraphs            from Constantinoplo that it will still further disoourage            our friends in Russia, and will be  regarded as a  fresh sign            of failing strength, while  the dream  of reoovering Batoum           will be a fresh inoentive to pan-Islamism and pan-Turanian            activity.                                                       Admiral
             Admiral Webb whom I saw 2 days ago deolares that the        result will be calamitous.             We are.-about in the approaching Pea^e Gonferonce to        propose the conversion of Batoum into a free port with a zone        around it a&amp;d be placed under the guarantee of the League        of Nations.   Such a solution appears to be the only        guarantee against Batoum becoming a cockpit, not only of        fratricidal struggles between the Caucasian States, but of        revived rivalry between larger and more dangerous powers,        Turkey,Germany, Russia.             The moment our forces are withdrawn tho Georgians will        deejeud upon Batoum and the energies which should be devoted        to building a barrier against a Bolshevik advance from the        Caucasus will ba consumed in Internecine strife with the        neighbours with whom they have with so much difficulty been        reconciled, but who will not be content to see so rich a        prize faUuncontested into the hands of a single State.             As Admiral Webb put it to me the retention of the        British garrison at Batoum for the short interval before it        is handed over to the League of Nations, is the keystone        of the entire arch..   If this be dislodged the whole will        fall.             I earnestly entreat my Colleagues to retrace their        steps and to refrain from insisting upon what I am afraid,        if persisted in, may turn out to have beac  a capital error.                        (Initialled). C. of &amp;.                                               *2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I.     February 9th,  1920.
