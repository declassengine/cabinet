                                                         *3 0 c 1*    With reference  to  Cabinet 5 (20),  Conclusion  3, that a Committee, consisting of representatives  of  the Admiral ty? War Of floe,  Air  Ministry and !hre.asirry^  with Sir  It,  Worthing ton Evans  as Chairman,  should be-HspTpoiirt.e4, to consider  the proposals of the Admiralty in  regard to Disability Pensions, it  was explained that  Sir  I. Worthington  Evans had asked to be excused from acting  as Chairman on  the ground  that his Department was not concerned with these pensions and that the question before the Committee affeoted mainly the Service Departments and  the Treasury, and it  was suggested that Mr. Stanley Baldwin should aot as Chairman and that a.representative of the Ministry of Pensions,should, bo added as a Member of the. Committee.        .  ,      $he Committee dealded  :-     . .,. ,,. tfhat the Admiralty proposals should be         &quot;referred to an  inter-departmental Committee    .....consisting of, representatives of the        ;,&quot;Treasury,^A&amp;jdraity, War Office, Air Ministry     ..&apos;   ,&apos;  and Ministry of Pensions, and that,  in           view of Sir L.  Worthington Evans1 request,     ,      Mr. Stanley: Baldwin, M.P.., should act as         &apos;..&apos; Chairman.&apos; 2.&apos;   The, Committee had before them a memorandum by the, Chancellor of the Exohequer. (i\C.-39). in&apos;whioh tfce,. question was raised of altering, the standard of fineness of the silver coinage and,  of issuing nioxel 6d. and 3d pieces.      It was pointed out  that  the price of silver had for some time been continually rising  owing,to  increased demands for currency and for  export to ChAna and it now stood considerably above,melting point.    It was therefore, no  longer possible, for. the  Mint,to  coin silver ,of the existing  standard without a loss  and it was profitable  to melt  or  export  existing  silver  coinage for bullion.
     Lord CunliffVs Committee on currency and Foreignftxahangea had been asked te o(insider the general positionand they had submitted a special report, reetmwmidin^:**       (a)  That tke restrictions en melting and            expert of silver Coins Should Tie maintained.       (b)  That the lioyal Mint should be enlarged.       (o)  That emergency 3/.-, fe/l and l/.- notes       shtuld bo printed for use if necessary.       (i)  That nickel seine shcizld.be substituted            for the present fid. and 3d. pieces, which            wear Tsadl^ and require constant renewal.       (-e)  Should alterations In coins cf higher            donomlMtions than fid. become necessary, the            new oeiris should be as nearly as possible  .            of the same weight and size as these now            current i     lotion had been taken en the first three of theseKeoemmendatiene and the Committee were now asked teconsider the two remaining points.     It was explained that Lerd Cualiffe,s Committeehad been pressed te consider whether it wvuld not bebetter te issue notes than debase the silver coinagebut oareful enquiries shewed that the issue of notes9:2 lew denominatiens weuld be very unpopular,   Te meetthe situation, therefore, it wae proposed (a) te reducethe fineness o* the 3a rger silver coins from 925 to$Oi/lOOtths of pure silver and (fc) to issue Sd. and 3d.wieees of pure niokel, which could easily be turned out at Weelwieh.     Seme doubt was expressed whether the issue of  smallnickel coins was necessary.   The reduction of finenessof the silver coinage oould be defended on the groundthat the coins would still ha*e an intrinsio value fully                                                     toqual to the pre-war equivalent and it would make no difference to thee appearance of the ooins.   It wouldbe advisable to areid any .rlsk cf disturbing thopuilio mind by issuing nioJcs%
                  On  tho othov hand it was pointod out that              silver VT,3 not? throe or four tinea its pro-^ar veluo              and  that the. reduction in fineness proposed vrould  not,              in fact, go f;r  enough to compensate for tho rise  in              price, and it vas suggested that tho fineness should bo              reduced  to 500 Instc-rd of 600.  It ras steted thet there              might be some technical difficulty in &quot;-educing the fineness              to this  extent,  .&quot;nd this vrs one of the reasons vhy nickel              coins v&apos;orc- suggested for the smaller denominations.                  Thr question was raised whether the Hints in  the              Dominions vould  follovr tho same course as that adopted              hwre, end it was stfted that the Australian Mint had              already  mad;, enquiry as to vhat the British Government              proposed to do*                            The Committee decided?*                      1*   To  Authorise the Chancellor of the                       Exchequer to reduce the fineness of silver                       coinage to 60O/IAOOTHS or balow, if on                       enquiry he found a lor-or standard practicable.                      g.   While they *fould prefer to avoid the  issue                       of nickel coins j the Chancellor of tho Exchequer                       should have discretion to make the necessary                       arrangements for the issue, of such coins                       subject to the passage of the necessary  logis-                       lation, if on further examination he.  considered                    v that this course vac unavoidable*&apos;tM. FACTORY     5.    With reference to Finance Committee 16, Minute  6,THE NAVYftflON HEATH,   the  Committee had before them  tho draft terms of reference              proposed by the  First Lord of the Admiralty for the              Committee, which  it r.\as agreed  should bo set up  to  consider              the  necessity of maintaining n special Cordite  Factory  fcr              tho  Navy at Holton Heath.  (P.C.34.)                      It ^ss stated that no objection was taken  by ,              any  of the Departments concerned to  these draft terms              bu&apos;,  that It would be desirable to add  the yrorda &quot;and              military&apos;1 after  &quot;naval&quot;, in the first paragraph.
           The Committee decided                  That the First Lord of the Admiralty                should set up a Committee consisting of                Lord Moult on.(In the Chair ,if willing to                serve), representatives of the Admiralty,                Vlar Offioe,  Ministry of Munitions and two                or three ciVMians with the following terms                of reference :*                  To report  what will be the most economieal                and efficient arrangements for the manufacture                of naval and military oordite, and particularly                as to whether it is practicable consistently r                with efficiency of naval and military supplies,                to dispense  frith the Maintenance of separate  .&apos;&apos;                Government factories for the Navy and Army                requirements.                  In framing its recommendations the Committee                should consider i-                  (a)  the practicability of adopting the                       naval standard of cordite for Army                       purposes?                  (b)  the desirability of maintaining the                       necessary power of expansion of output;                       and                  (c)  all other relevant facts *LAMENT        4* The  Committee took note of the memorandum oirculatedIAIMS  m iH NATION- by the President  of the Board of Trade  (F.C37)  in which i  AGAINST GOVERN-   it was stated that the Board of Trade were setting           up the neoessary  organisation tc deal with all claims           by British Nationals against enemy Governments,  and -           that they hoped very shortly to take over the files           held by  the Foreign Claims Office, as proposed by  the           Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (F.C.S6). 5TMMT3         The  Committee considered the  memorandum  circulated           by the President  of the Board of Trade  in regard to           -investments in Germany  (C.P.252).  It was pointed  out           that German  firms were offering highly attractive           terms  for foreign capital  and enquiries  were  being made           as to  whether  investments  of this  kind  were  considered           by the Government to be in the national interest or  otherwise.
f              The opinion me -expressed  that  such arrangements would          very likely-&quot;prove  to  bo  of groat advantage  to our national          trade,  but the  general feeling  was that  it  was  for private          business men  to dooido how far  they  would take  up suoh ventures          and that the  less  the Government appeared as advisers the          better.               It was,  howevor, strongly  urged that tho time had come          to  give some  definite encouragement  to the  re-opening of          trade relations with  Germany,   Public sentiment still          appeared te regard it as unpatriotic to  trade with Germany          and the change  in  the situation which followed  on the oon- f        elusion of Peaoe did  not yet seem to be  realised.    Now that          peace had been  declared, it should be a  real peace.   M. Klotis          had already stated in the French Chamber that he would not pay          high prices to  british manufacturers for goods  which          could be bought oheaply  in Germany.   It was in our  interests          to  see  that the present  German  Government,  which was anti*          militarist, should be enablod to get firmly established and          it  oould only do this if trade  relations were freely renewed.               The Committee decided                    That, while no definite opinion could be expressed                    by  the Government in  regard to investments of                    British  capital in German  enterprises, ne  obstacle                    should be put.  in the  way of suoh  Investments.    OF    6.    The Committee considered the Interim Report ef  the 10II OF HOlAl    Council of Financial  Officers,  of which  Mr. Stanley  Baldwin I0EKS.          was Chairman  (F.C 33) and also a Note by Sir Warren Fisher          on that Report  (F.C.  35).               It was explained that the  Report of the, Counoil          contained    a  number of recommendations in regard to          the status of Financial  Offioers in  public  Departments                                                                 the                                    - 5 -
the scope of their duties,  departmental prooedureand organisation in financial matters,  which were generally agreed.   Sir Warren Fisher11 s Note was directed to four points   (si)  the position of tho Financial Officers in  the        Admiralty, War Office and Air MiniBtry:   (D)  the necessity of doing nothing in the case        of Civil Departments to impair tho position        and authority of the Permanent Secretary as the        official primarily responsible to Ministers        for economy in regard both to questions of        policy and to tho organisation for effecting        it.   (c)  the importance of the Principal Establishment        Officer as the effective agent of the        Permanent secretary for ensuring economy in        all matters of staff, organisation, and        machinery generally.   (d)  the method of appointment to higher posts in        the Civil Servioe.     As regards the first point, the Council had recommendedthat  the Financial Offioers in the Service department should be made members of their respective Boards.It was explained that this would result in placing the Financial Officers in these Departments in asuperior position to the Permanent Head, who was theSecretary of the Board of Council but not a member.      Under this proposal, the Permanent Civilian Headwould be divorced from any interest in finanolal oontrol,which was the only sphere of administration in these departments in which the civilian element could naturallyclaim to have a definite say.  It was strongly urgedthat  everything should be done to identify  the permanent secretary in these Departments with responsibility forfinanoe.      As regards the fourth point, it was suggested thatthe defeesa of organisation in public Departments,which had frequently come to light during the War,                                                  could                           mt g m
could be traced in many oases to the inadequate considerationgiveh to th^ selection of the higher offioials in these departments and it was proposed that ail., appointments toand removals from the following posts in each Office^.vis *,the Permanent Head of the Department, his Deputy, thePrincipal Financial Officer and the Principal EstablishmentOfficer should be subject to confirmaiion by the PrimeMinister.     The Committee decided     to approve the recommendations in the Beport of the     Council of Financial Officers, subject to the     following amendments     (a)  that the Permanent Civilian Head of the Service          Departments should be charged with the primary          responsibility for finance and he should have the          status of a full member of the Council or Boardt     it)  that the Principal Financial Officer in Civil          Departments should continue to be, definitely          subordinate to the Permanent Head of the          Department who is primarily responsible, under          Ministers, for economy!     (o)  that in all matters of staff organisation and          machinery the Offioer held responsible for          economy by the Permanent Head should be the          Principal Establishment -Officer!     (d),  that the appointment, or removal, of Permanent          Heads of Departments, their Deputies,          Principal Financial Officers and Principal          Establishment Officers should be confirmed          by the Prime Minister before taking effeot.Whitehall Gardens, S.^7.1  &apos;S0tH January, 192$.

During  the autumn in view of the high pries         of silver temporary arrangements were made  (a) to         make  it an offence under Defence of the Realm let         to melt down silver coin, and (b) to prohibit the         expert of silver coin or silver bullion from the         United Kingdom  except under-license,   for the time         being these  measures have been effective but the         danger of melting will tend to increase.         4.&apos;   Accordingly in November 1 requested lord OtmlliiVa         Committee on Curvanoy and Foreign Exchanges to consider         the general  position of the silver ooinage amd they         have  now  submitted a special report.                                                       Thei*
 flt   The It. ;rWonroen^!latio&amp;e are  a a  follow a: *    (a) That the  rastriccions  on melbing  and  export  of  silver coin should be maintained,,    (b.) That the  Royal Mint  should  be  enlarged,    (o) That emergency 3/-,  2/6d. and  l/- notes  should  be printed foa; use if neoessary,    (d) That nickel coins  should be substituted  for  the present 6d.  and 3d. pieces which  wear badly and  require  constant renewal Lord Inchcape, Sir Charles  Addis and  Mr. Beckett would have pre- ferred to  omit this  recommendation,    (e) Should  alterations in  coins of higher denominations than 6d,  become  neceseary the  new  coins should be as nearly as possible of the  same  weight aid size  as  those now current. 60      Steps have been taken  to meet  recommendations (a), (bj and  (o).   It is  now  necessary to come to a decision on the two remaining points* 7.      Should nickel coins  be substituted for the existing silver 6d.  and 3df  On this I recommend  that we should adopt a pure nickel coin of the same design  as  the existing coins and that steps shouldJbe  taken to  manufacture  the necessary niokel blanks, (if  possible at  i^oolwioh  in preference to the employment of out Side contractors,,) Legislation will  be necessary before the coins are  issued. 8.      Should we go  further and substitute a silver coin of reduced fineness for the coins above  6d?   On  this the Committee made no definite recommendation and were I believe divided between theExisting coin, a reduced  silver coin  and a base metal  coin.   The main argument  for maintaining the  existing si lver coin is senti- mental.   On the other hand it  cannot be produced without lo^sj it has ceased  to be  what  it always haa been  in  the past a pure- token coin; and  many other  countries  (inoluding  some of the British Dominions and Protectorates)  have taken  steps  to reduce the fineness of their coins.    The  Treasury  therefore propose to reduce the  fineness from 925 to  600  for the  l/-, 2/- and 2/6d, pieces. The  evidence before  the Committee  went to show  that the public would readily  accept a recofned l/-t                       - 2 -
     9. In rlew of the lap uw* of silver, lotow U?Mcirculation (some  o0,00C./000)  It  would toe i^oea^ary -for -the-new coins to circulate with existing silver for some time.ThiB wwild lead to difficulties if existing silver  coinsremain above melting point (66di per standard ounce) but  if by the time the new coine were ready for  issue the  price  ofsAVter had fallen to not more tn&amp;n 66d. BO that tootH the  eldand new coins were merMtf token coins there would te nt  room for Gresham&apos;B law to bpefrate..    10. It  should be added that Canada has  already  reduced using Colonies (e.g. Straiie settlement  and 3aei  Africa) are also preparing to reduce the fineness of, their coins  (or raise their face value);  and West Africa (which  has  a silver coinage of its own expressed in sterling)  Is propeei&amp;g to use a new brass jiloy.

FINANCE COMMITTEE

At the meeting of the Cabinet Finance Committee hold on 24th November, it was arranged that a Committee should be set up to consider the necessity of maintaining a special cordite factory for the Navy at Holton Heath; and that I should circulate the Terms of Reference to the Committee.

Accordingly I propose the following Terms of Reference:-

"To report what will be the most economical and efficient arrangements for the manufacture of naval cordite, and particularly as to whether it is practicable, consistently with efficiency of naval supplies, to dispense with the maintenance of separate Government factories for the Navy and Army requirements.

In framing its recommendations the Committee should consider :

(a) the practicability of adopting the naval standard of cordite for Army purposes;

(b) the desirability of maintaining the necessary power of expansion of output; and

(c) all other relevant facts.

I am in communication with Ministers in regard to the representation on the Committee.

 [This Document is the Property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                    Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.F.C.-36,                                                       f    SETTLEMENT OF  CLAIMS BY BRITISH NATIONALS AGAINST                        ENEMY GOVERNMENTS.    THE claims against  enemy Governments registered during  the war with  theForeign Claims Office of the Foreign Office fall into two classes :     1.  Reparation claims which are to be dealt with by the Reparation Commission,          i.e., claims for personal injury or loss of property due to enemy action.    2.  Compensation claims which are to be dealt with  by  the Mixed Arbitral          Tribunals, i.e., claims in respect of damage to British property, rights          and interests arising out of enemy war legislation.    The first class has been provided for, but no organisation has yet been set upfor dealing  with  the  presentation  of  compensation   claims or  their prosecutionbefore the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals.   Such claims form a large  and difficult class,and give rise to a daily increasing volume of correspondence with which the staff ofthe Foreign Claims  Office is no longer  able to cope,  and which  relates to mattersentirely outside the  sphere of the Foreign Office.    To leave claimants to prosecute their own claims before the Tribunals would, inview of the action already taken in respect of such claims, be contrary to the policywhich the claimants have been led to anticipate.  Such a course would, moreover,deprive poorer claimants of  4the benefit  of  the  treaties, make it  impossible toco-ordinate the work of the Tribunals, and encourage enemy Governments to resistclaims  which might  otherwise be settled.    It is essential:     (i.) That before the Treaties come into force an  organisation for dealing with          these Compensation claims should be set up.    (ii.) That, in view of  the fact that Compensation  and Reparation claims largely          overlap and frequently  give rise  to  the  same problems, the work in          connection  with both should be centralised under the Department which          is responsible for the Reparation and Clearing Office organisations, viz.,          the Board of Trade.    A memorandum by Mr. Justice Peterson and Mr.  M. M. Macnaghten, K.C., is appended, which contains a more detailed statement of the case.                                                                 C. OF K.    December 19, 1919.Memorandum by the Hon. Mr. Justice Peterson and the Hon. M. M. Macnaghten,                                    K.C.    During  the  war Proclamations  were  issued  in  this  country  and  the overseas Dominions requiring British subjects who had claims against the enemyGovernments to make returns cf their claims to the Foreign Claims Office at theForeign Office.    The Foreign Claims Office prescribed the form in which the claims should be presented and the evidence to be filed in support thereof.   In all cases where the directors of the Foreign Claims Office considered that the  evidence  disclosed a prima facie right to  compensation, the claimant was informed that his claim  hadbeen duly registered  &quot;with a view to such action  as His Majesty&apos;s government might think fit  to take on the conclusion of  hostilities.&quot;    The Treaties of Peace provide for the settlement of these  claims either throughthe Reparation  Commission or the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals;  but in some cases theclaim comes partly within the jurisdiction of one tribunal and partly  within thatof the other.
    The Cabinet having decided that all the claims against  enemy governments should be taken  over by the several Departments to which from their nature theyrespectively appertain (e.g., claims in respect of ships and their cargoes are to betaken over by the Ministry of Shipping; claims of merchant seamen by the Boardof Trade; claims in respect of damage  caused by air raids and claims  of civilianprisoners of war by the Reparation authority),  the  Foreign  Claims  Office  was practically demobilised  in  August last  and the two  Directors of the  Office  wererelieved of their duties.   It was then supposed that  nothing remained  to be donebut to transfer  the claims to the  appropriate Departments,  and that  there was,therefore, no further need for skilled legal supervision of the work of the ForeignClaims  Office.    There has been considerable delay in the work of transferring the claims,  anda question has now arisen with regard to one particular class of claims, viz., claims in respect of  property  situate in  enemy  or  &apos;&apos; occupied&apos;&apos; territory, which  wasrequisitioned,  liquidated, sequestrated,  or otherwise interfered with by  the enemy.These claims will presumably be dealt with by the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals, and,since compensation awarded by those tribunals is to be paid to  the Clearing Office,it was supposed  that that Office would take charge of them.   Moreover, the claimsthemselves are in many cases closely  connected with  claims which  unquestionablycome within the sphere of  the Clearing Office.    The Board of Trade,  which hascharge of the Clearing Office organisation, are in  doubt as to taking  over these claims,  and the  decision of the Cabinet is needed on the matter.    The claims  cannot remain at. the Foreign  Office; there  is now no means ofdealing with them there.    Nor can they be returned  to the  claimants with an intimation that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose  to take any  action,  andthat the claimants must do the best they can for themselves.    Moreover, if each individual claimant were left to prosecute his claim unaidedbefore the Mixed Arbitral Tribunal (or the Reparation Commission where the claimcame partly within its jurisdiction) the  result would be most unfortunate.   Manyof the claimants being poor persons in humble circumstances of  life would be quite  unable  to  present their  claims to  the Tribunal  owing to lack of  means and education.   Those  claimants who had  the means to  prosecute their claims wouldnot know how to set about  it.    Each acting for himself  and according  to his  ownlights, there would be no co-ordination in the claims; and without co-ordination thedelay and confusion in  dealing with the matter  would be very great.    It is therefore submitted that these claims should at  once be transferred to the clearing Office,  or, failing that, to  some organisation created for  the  purpose.    The  matter is  urgent.   Claimants  write to  the  Foreign   Claims Officeand  to  the  Commercial   Department   of   the   Foreign   Office  asking  forinformation and advice, and in the present circumstances  no answer can be givento their enquiries.  The number of these letters increases day by day;  and so  soonas the Treaty of Peace with Germany comes into force the requests for information and advice will  certainly become more  numerous and insistent.   The  answers tothese enquiries can only be  given by a Department which  has the papers relating tothe claims and is responsible for their presentation to the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals.

Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1919.SECRET.F.C.-33.CABINET.FINANCE COMMITTEE.COUNCIL OF FINANCIAL OFFICERS.               Interim Report on the Position of Accounting Officers.    AT their first meeting the Council proceeded  to discuss the general position ofAccounting  Officers  and the  possibility of effective reform in the present  financialprocedure of Departments.  On the 10th November, 1.919, the Chancellor of the Exchequerrequested the Council to consider, together with other proposals for strengthening thehands  of  Accounting Officers, the  suggestion contained in paragraph 9 of the first report of the  Select Committee on National Expenditure (1919;, that  the AccountingOfficer of each spending Department should  be a Treasury official appointed by andsolely responsible to the Treasury.    The Council having reviewed the matters  before them   desire  to  submit  thefollowing considerations:     2. The proposal of the Select Committee is based upon the difficulty of the positionof Accounting Officers.  As officers of the Departments  in which they serve they aresubordinate  to the head of their Department and may be overruled  by him.  It is represented that if their recommendations are  discouraged they may relax their efforts,and the proposal to make them officials of the Treasury is evidently intended to give them greater status and independence.    3. We hold that in all cases in which a special Financial Officer exists responsiblefor the financial  criticism of  administrative  measures, he should hold  the post ofAccounting Officer, and as such should be  responsible for financial regularity.  In thelatter capacity he possesses a large measure of independence. He cannot be compelledto make a payment  to which he sees objection except by written  directions by thehead of his Department.    We think that wherever this  takes place it should be an absolute rule that the papers should be communicated to the Comptroller and  Auditor-General, and that the accouting Officer should notify the Treasury of what has taken place.    4. As a Financial Officer,  on the other hand, a part of whose duties consists of theexercise of financial advice and criticism  in matters of  policy and administration as distinct from financial regularity, his powers are limited to making representations tohis official superiors.  If his view be not accepted by the head of  his  Department, hecan carry the matter no further;  indeed, it is then generally, if not invariably, hisfunction in  a matter in which the consent of the Treasury is required, to press theTreasury to accept the very views which  he  himself may have strenuously resistedwithin his own Department,    5. Anomalous as his position is in this respect, the Financial Officer is not singularin the liability to be overruled by his Minister, or in having on occasion to carry out apolicy of which he personally disapproves.  What we have to consider is whether the effectiveness  of financial control  in  the  public  service is unduly prejudiced  by theconditions under which finaDcial officers work, and whether it could be strengthened,either by  the measure proposed or by some other remedy.[This Document; is  the Property of His  Britannic Majestys Government^
    6. The. position of the principal permanent civil  servant responsible for financevaries a good deal in the different public Departments, and the nature of the financial control exercised varies  not less.   Generally speaking, it would not  be  unjust  to  saythat there is a  tendency on  the part  of  administrative officers  to evade  financial control on  the plea of high  policy or otherwise, and that financial officers, even in  thebest regulated departments, have continually to be on the watch against encroachmentson the part of zealous but impetuous colleagues.    7. Such vigilance is uphill work, and  occasionally may involve a certain friction,though  on  the   whole  the  system  works  in  our experience  with  smoothness.Moreover, Ministers are  not unnaturally disposed to attach more weight  to the successof their policy than to its cost; and the  war has markedly accentuated the tendency to disregard  financial precautions on the plea of urgency.    8. Working under  these  conditions the Financial Officer ought to have all  thecounterbalancing advantages which can be  given him ; but in point of fact this cannotbe said to be the case.   Finance is represented  by  the Parliamentary or  FinancialSecretaries on the  Board of Admiralty,  the Army Council, or the Air Council, and  not by any civil servant; and even  in  many  civil Departments  the principal  FinancialOfficer ranks only  as one of a number of Assistant Secretaries.    9. The proposal that  the Accounting Officer shall  be a Treasury official  does  not commend itself to  us.     (i.)  In the first place, it offends  against the  cardinal  principle  of Ministerial           responsibility.  A  Minister could not be properly responsible to Parliament           for the conduct of his Department  if a large part of the responsibility falls           actually on  the servant of  another Department to whom he is  unable to           give orders.     (ii.) In the second  place,  the tendency to  evade financial control alluded to above           would, in our  view, become more marked if  the officer  to be evaded           were an emissary of another Department.   At present the Financial  Officer           is the servant  of the  same  Minister as  the administrative  officers,  and is           entitled to the same access to official papers and confidential  information as           they are; these  are advantages of great value in  financial  control which           might  be lost if he became an officer of the Treasury.    (iii.) Thirdly, the Treasury  Officer could not work single-handed.   He  would           require staff.   This would  presumably have  to  be  Treasury  staff,  too.           There would thus be an elaborate interweaving of the staff of two Depart-           ments under one roof, under conditions which would almost inevitably give           rise to  friction and discontent.    (iv.) The position  obtaining in the  Ministry  of Transport does not  afford  a           precedent for  the proposal that  the  Accounting  Officer should  be  a           Treasury official.   The Accounting Officer of the Ministry of Transport           is responsible to  the  Minister, but works  in  close  association  with  a           Treasury  Officer specially  attached to  the Ministry in  view of peculiar           circumstances arising  out of the Ministry of Transport Act.    10. We think that other measures  might  be taken to improve the effectiveness offinancial  criticism, and  we therefore make the following suggestions  relative to  thestatus of Financial Officers, the  scope  of  their duties,  departmental  procedure  and organisation:   .    (a.)  We suggest, in  order  to remove the objection that their independence iscompromised by the fact that  they are  appointed by  and removable by the head oftheir Department,  that the selection of  the Chief Financial Officer in the principalDepartments should require the consent of the Chancellor of the  Exchequer and  thePrime Minister, and that he should be removable under the same consent only.    (6.) Criticisms from the Financial  Officer  should not be  limited by any narrowinterpretation of the province of finance, but should be allowed the fullest scope whereany possibility of substantial economy is involved.    (c.) In our view it is desirable that all correspondence with  the Treasury  should either      (i) be drafted by the Finance Department after such departmental discussion as             may be necessary ;  or     (ii) where the Finance Department prefers, concurred in by that Department.
    This concurrence should be necessary for  letters, other than routine  letters, onestablishment matters as on other business.    (d.) When the Chief Financial Officer of a Public  Department is not the permanent secretary  or  head of  the Department the relation between him and his permanentchief  requires very careful adjustment.   We think it most  undesirable to encourage the idea that  the functions of the permanent head are divorced from or antagonistic to finance, or that the existence  of a separate Financial  Department in any  way relievesother officers  of their duty to be economical.    The public service  deals with so great a variety of subjects, and its organisationtakes so many different forms that it is not practicable to lay down hard-and-fast rules of procedure  applicable alike to all Departments.  The Civil Departments over which a minister presides, whether as Secretary of State or as President of a so-called  Board,have as a  rule a Permanent Secretary (sometimes more than one), who is the permanenthead of the Department and the principal adviser of the Minister on questions of  policy,but is not as a  rule  the  principal Financial  Officer.  Other  Civil Departments are organised under  Boards or Commissions, sometimes,  as in the Revenue Departments,salaried   officers  responsible  to Ministers, sometimes  unpaid  Statutory  Boards orTrustees under a  charter, while another type of Civil Department has under the minister a  Board or Council of Civil Officers acting as advisers to the Minister, and occupyingjointly a position  analogous to that of the permanent head of a Department of the first-named kind.  The Admiralty, War Office, and  Air Ministry, in which the Governmentadvisers on policy must necessarily be sailors, soldiers, or airmen, form again a furthertype of Public Department.     We think that in Civil Departments of the first-named type, where full discussionof a problem reveals  an irreconcilable  cleavage between the views of the executivestaff and  the finance  side of the office, if the Permanent Secretary dissents from -theChief  Financial  Adviser,  the views of  the  latter should, as  a matter of ordinaryprocedure, be placed  before the Minister  through the Permanent Secretary, and theFinancial Adviser should have the right of access to his Minister and an opportunity of explaining his views.     In Revenue  Departments which are governed by a  Board the Chairman of theBoard is responsible for the advice to be given to Ministers on  revenue questions ofpolicy, and the desirability of obtaining the opinion of the Accounting Officer on these should  be left to his  discretion.    The Accounting Officer  should have the same position as a critic of the Vote expenditure as the  iVccounting Officer in any otherDepartment.     In those Departments in which the Minister has set up a Council (the examples of this type  are  the Ministries  of Food, Labour, Munitions, and Transport) the headof the Finance Department should ex officio serve upon the Council, and should thus have an opportunity of  expressing his opinions from the  point of view of finance;but he should have the same  rights as in any other Civil  Department of direct access to his Minister.     In the Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry we  believe that the best safeguardfor finance would be  that professional, as distinct from  parliamentary, knowledge offinance should be represented on the Board, and accordingly that the permanent civil servant in charge of financial duties should be a member of the  Board.  Doubts havebeen expressed whether the existence of a subordinate Minister specially charged withfinance duties would be compatible with this  suggestion.  We do not think that thisdual representation of finance  upon the Board would necessarily be unworkable or would at  all  overstrengthen finance, regard being had to the fact that the members ofthe Board other than the Minister are primarily interested in policy.     We attach great importance in all Departments to questions involving finance beingreferred  to Finance Departments before being submitted to the Minister for approval,and,  moreover, at an  early stage, so that they may  assist  in  forming proposals  stillmalleable rather  than  engage on destructive criticism after they have crystallized.  Tothis end adequate and properly  distributed staff is in our view necessary, and where such duties are performed the staff engaged upon them should not consist of personnel of inferior status to that of the  administrative  or secretarial branches  of the Office, though of course in all branches alike the proportion  of different classes of staff must be regulated in accordance with the character of the work.      (e.)  The titles of  the Chief Financial Officers of  large  Departments appear to us to require reconsideration: thus, the title &quot; Accountant General,&quot; in use in several  of them, lays too much stress on the accounting as distinct from the advisory or financial
duties which, should pertain to the office.  *With so much variety in function  and organisation in the several Departments, we cannot recommend any uniform appellation;but in each case a  title should  be sought which would  be sufficiently descriptive ofthe holder&apos;s functions, and would adequately mark his due status in the Department.E. ST. J. BAMFORD, Secretary.    t In signing this Report I wish it to be understood that I am not of opinion thatthe recommendations in the last  part of paragraph 10 (d) and (e) could be adopted inall respects as they stand with practical advantage to the Admiralty organisation.Uth December, 1919.    X I have joined in the recommendation that in the fighting Departments the ChiefPermanent Financial  Officer should be a member of the Board because on manysubjects the specialised knowledge and experience of the  Finance Department oughtto be brought  to  bear during the Board&apos;s viva voce discussions.   But as these Boardsdeal with many subjects altogether outside the  Financial Officers province, I thinkhis position should rather be that of an associate member.(Signed)  STANLEY BALDWIN.t V. W.

I circulate a note by Sir Warren Fisher on the applicationof the Baldwin Committee^ Report to the Departments administerIng the Fighting Services.&apos;                       (Intld)  A.C.Treasury, S;f.   December 22ndft W19*            You  asked me  to.send yen a note  of  any comments  that  occurF.C.53.  to me  on  the  report          dated 11th instant by the Council        of &quot;Financial  Officers in regard to the position of Accounting        Officerso        2,      Mr,  Baldwin and Mr, Barstow have  discussed this question        with me from  time  to time and I am in agreement with  the        general tenor of the report.        So      As  regards  the fighting Departments 1 do not think  the        report goes far  enough.  In those Departments it is the soldier        or  sailor who is (a) the advisor of the  Mi ister in regard        to  policy and (b)  responsible to the  Minister for the organisa^        tlon  and  administration of the main machinery for carrying out        that  policy.  The  civilian is subsidiary and subordinate        except in regard to  finance.  Therefore  I think the permanent        civilian head should be the principal finance officer, with        (also) the status  of a full member of the Council or  Board.        The report only  makes the latter suggestion which taken alone        would produce the  anomaly that the permanent head of  the office        would be  the  servant of the finance officer in the latter&apos;s        capacity  as member cf Council.  The result would only be        friction between those two civilian officers instead  of unity        in  opposing extravagance op the part  of the warrior.        4*    j As regards  Civil Departments,  the permanent secretary is        the advisor on policy and the general manager of the  organises        tion  for effecting it.  The chief responsibility for  economy        under both heads is  his and a finance officer so designated is        not the principal, still less the sole,  trustee in the Department        for the taxpayer.   If a Minister is inclined to extravagance        in  his conception  of policy or his plans for *aecutii^ it,  it        is  primarily  the duty of the permanent secretary to&apos;wet so far        as, possible as  a moderating influence and not to shift this task        on  to the finance  officer or any one  else,  But the efficient        working of this  principle postulates  that the sense of reaponsi-        bility in the permanent Secretary must not be diminished by the        creation of an  imperlum in imperio represented by a finance        officer more  or  less independent of the permanent secretary.        Such  an arrangement  T given human nature- would tend  to throw        the permanent secretary always into the arms of the Minister        and between them they would beat the  finance officer  every time.        Fhat  is wanted  - if  a Minister is extravagant - is the closest        co-operation  between the permanent secretary and his  subordinate,        the finance officer, in an endeavour to convert the Minister.        I make these  remarks lest the report  as drawn should  be misapplies        in  such a fashion  as to undermine the position Of the permanent        secretary in  his own Department and thereby weaken or deter the        official personality which can be the most potent of  all in        securing economy.HIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITAHNIC MAJESTY 1b  GOVSRStMENT)1..
5.     As Is rot unnatural in the circumstances, tho reportpractically ignores the ex&amp;atence of a type of officer no leeoimportant than the finance officer himself in connection witheconomy viz.-the principal establishment officer.  In the realmof staff, organisation and machinery generally the new type of establishment officer with distinctive status is the real watch-dog for economy.  He is to be picked because he knows aboutsuch things;  the finance officer as such has no experience and neither on the constructional nor on the critical side cfestablishment matters could ha be comparable with a first rateman of general manager training.  l&quot;he Treasury is by degreesgetting the big establishment officers to work as a team andtherein lies the chance of economy - to the extent that thesubject matter makes possible.  (Large savings are of courseall in policy).     I am quite clear that in matters of staff etc. it is tothe establishment officer (under his permanent secretary) andnot to the finance officer that &apos;&apos;*e must look for economicalma -encouragement ,6.     In regard to the appointment or removal of the principalfinance officer I thoroughly agree that the concurrence of thePrime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer should In everyinstance be an essential condition.  The same rule should., inmy opinion, apply also to the posts of permanent secretary (orwhatever the title of the particular departmental head maybe),the deputy to the departmental head, and the principal establishment officer.  Efficiency and economy in the management ofGovernment departments as of any other business turn on the topmen, and too often as the result of inexperience or misplacedkindness the wrong men are appointed.
