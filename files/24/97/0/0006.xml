(THIS rOClMEHT IS THIS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY j S, GOVDRftlMSHT.)   SJCJ KT,        &apos;                       CABIN3T,   c* -P*  50o.                , . &quot;      r&apos;                   ORGANISATION POR MBBTX30 STRIKgS.             --Memorandum by the Chancellor of the  Exchequer.            I must dissent from the proposals put forward by the       Minister of Transport in his Memorandum CP.  01 in x4egard  to       the,expenditure to. be incurred by the proposed organisation to       ddeal with National Strikes,   Sir E. Geddes-proposes  first       that the expenditure should be concentrated in a single  Vote       for presentation to Parliament and secondly that the  Department       which should be made responsible  for the Vote  should  be. the       Treasury.   Both these proposals  seem to me to be open to       serious objection.            It is a fundamental principle of public accounting  that       expenditure should be accounted for by the Department which is-       responsible for that expenditure  and in a  position to exercise       real oontrcl over it.  The suggestion that the various items of       expenditure, which will differ very largely in character and       which will be incurred by  several Departments, should bo-       included in a single Vote  and should be borne  **y a &quot;neutral       department&quot; constitutes a  departure from this  cardinal principle       which might call forth wholly unanswerable comments from the       Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Atcounts  Committee       Prom the financial and Parliamentary point of  view it seems to be       that the only defensible course will be for the various  Itepart-       ments concerned to make provision on their Votes for  such       expenditure on Strikfe Organisation as may bo approved by H.M.       Government so far as the services concerned fall under their       control, and X am not aware of any considerations,  administrative       or other, which would be of sufficient importance to  justify a       departure in this case from the correct and normal procedure.       Even looking at the problem from the point of view of political
m 2. valmost entirely in favour of the course which I propose.    Itseems to me to be both unnecessary and undesirable to bring these operations of the Government into the limelight by introducing a special Vote, which must inevitably give rise to a considerableamount of hostile criticism and create suspicion among theLabour Party.     Even if reasons are adduced which might justify the  concentra^tion of this expenditure in a special Vote I oan see no kind ofjustification for placing the responsibility upon the Treasury.The Treasury Vote ia intended to cover the salaries and expensesof the Treasury, which has nothing to do with an organisation of theVln4 in question.   The Accounting Officer of the Treasury coulc: not possibly exercise any kind of control over the expenditure incurred by the several Departments, and the Treasury Ministers would be jnxtin the wholly false position of having to defend in the House ofCommons expenditure for which they are in no sense responsible andwhich they oannot control.     further the Treasury ought not to be a spending Department. Itis true that certain exceptions to this rule have been made in thepast - though Sven those exceptions have been criticised  - but therehas never been an instance of the Treasury assuming the responsibilinty for aifloellaneous and varied expenditure such as is involved inthe present proposal.  Such a oourse would create a most  undesirable jprecedent.     I submit, therefore, that the proper course is that  each department should be made responsible for the expenditure which iti30U**3.  If however, it is thought desirable to include all theexpenditure in a single Vote then I submit that the Department whichshould bear the charge ought to be the Home Office, as being ;hJlepartment which is responsible for domestic affairs generally and Irjparticular for the maintenance of law and order.                           (intd,)  A. C.TREASURY.   26th January, 1920.
