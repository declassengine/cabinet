Buying the past 12 months the Committee has given veryserious consideration tc the possibilities of harnessing  thetides in the Severn estuary, and has taken evidence from  anumber of engineers of recognised  standing,  who have come forward with definite sohemes and provisional estimates of cost.     In view of the number of novel and difficult problems tobe overcome before it can he said  whether  it is technically  orcommercially feasible to harness the tides for the productionof power, the Committee decided to carry out an entirelyindependent investigation of the general problem.  The investiga-tion has been based upon the Severn tidal  power schemes whichwere regarded in the light of a test case  owing to the particular-ly favourable conditions prevailing in the estuary and  m thodistrict. The Committee has already approached the leadingmanufacturers of water  turbines and electrical plant both in thiscountry and abroad with the view of securing the best technical .opinion available upon the different problems to be solved.     Although the encuiries have not yet been completed,  and itis therefore impossible to formulate definite conclusionsregarding&apos; the feasibility of a tidal power scheme in the  Severnestuary, the Committee  is of the opinion - on the basis  of theevidence and further  information already available that  there is-,.a possibility of the scheme taking practical shape in thefuture.     Tho scheme would involve the construction of a dam orbarrage across the estuary (with the necessary facilities forthe passage of shipping and offers the prospect of furnishinga very large supply of  electrical energy,  namely  an cut-put&apos;approximating to&quot;300,000 K.W. on the basis of ordinary industrialdemands for 10 hours per day. This was about the  maximum loadin 1918 at nine of  the  largest power stations in  this countrytaken  together.           -    -     Tho scheme also presents other attractions, since  the barrage, if erected, would, furnish a means of providing additionalrailway and road transit between the West of England and SouthWales.  The reauirements in  this direction, have become   increasingly urgent during the past few years  and  this aspect of   theis one  to which  the Committee direct; particular attention.scheiiu6During
During the course of the enquiry  the attention of the C          ..    ..     . be  prejudiced  in the  event  of  the  leasing or  sale  of  the Beachlev peninsula.   It was felt  that  the Government  occupation 6f  the  Beachley peninsula at the  present  time  afforded  the opportunity of preventing future  exorbitant  demands in  respect or  land and facilities for  access,  which-might add substantially to  the  ultimate cost  of the scheme, which is  certain  to amount to  several  million pounds.    -  The Committee haw conferred  with  officers of  the Ministry ftf  Shipping and of the Office  of  Works on the  question  of  the  - disposal of the shipyards at Beachley  and Che-pa tow. and has unanimously recomiieJ^ed  that (1)  the position&quot;ought not to be prejudiced  by  any negotiations now in  hand   and (Z) the Government  snsuld take steps to safeguard the  future  interests of  a piential  scheme  that would be of  ^freat  National  importance.                                       i      The Board of Trade  therefore wrote  to  the Office of Works OIL December 12th asking  that the  following minimum-reservations should be incorporated in any contract for  the sale or  lease, of  the  Government property  in the Beachley peninsular,  namely;-      (1)    The Government  should reserre the right&apos; to  widen the             highway,  to double the ex is ting  railway,  and     make             reasonable use&apos;of highway, railway and sidings and             any vacant land, or buildings on conditions to be             fixed by agreement or by arbitration.      j(2)    The provisions  ef the Acquisition of Land (Assessment             of Compensation) Act  of 1919 should apply to the            - purchase  of  any land  which might, eventually be             acquired for the purpose  of  the  tidal  power sohemo.   ;      Tho Board also asked that provision should be made to- ensure that the Board were advised from time  to time of any  developments or alterations  that may take place on the psninsula in regard to railways, roads, housing etc.      The Offioe of Works  replied on December 23rd,that  in the opinion of the Ministry  of  Snipping any reservations  which the -Board might desire to have  included in any proposed sale  of  the&apos; Beachley Peninsula should  be communicated as  an instructionvto the Shipping Controller  by the Cabinet.      The scheme which the Committee is investigating  is one  of the highest importance,  and it would be regrettable  if  the execution of it; were impeded. through the lack of  reasonable arrangements with the eventual purchaser of  the, shipyard.  Unless therefore  the  conditions  suggested are likely to prove  a  serioug obstacle to the disposal of the sits,  we think the Shipping Controller should be -instructed  to press for  them.5th February, 1920.iStor GEMS.
