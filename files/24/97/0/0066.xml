 i his Document to    Property ofH.J Britannic W,jL\ij,fo GovernmentFIDENTIAL,   I circulate for the information of  the        Cabinet a Beport, prepared in the Board  of Trade,        on  the General Industrial Position,  which will        I  think be of general interest..

board  OF  TRADE,INDUSTRIES AFD IviAlJUFACTURES DEVARTIONT   RffiQRT JCVH , ,,Cjft j HEGi^RAh INDUSTRIAL..POSIT ICN.     (Much of the Information upon which this report  is  basedis secured from representatives of industry who have  placedtheir views &quot;before the Board in confidence,    Extracts fromthe report should not accordingly be published withoutsan ction),     The increase in railway rates has made a general read&quot;justment of prices necessary and this process;is likely to take some time, as one trade waits as a Tule upon the changes to be made by thooe which supply it with its raw material beforeattempting to make its own adjustments,   Owing to tho peculiarconditions at the moment.j however, this delay is not causincegreat disturbance; the manufacturing trades are, in general,already booked with orders for seme months ahead and havepostponed further booking until the future can be more clearlyseen.   Increases of pries have become so usual a feature duringthe last year that the present one is not regarded with suchapprehension as might havo been erpected,   It must bo remembersaieoP that it occurs at a t5me when our manufacturing industries are for the moment in a strong position, both, for home andcarport trade *     Signs of trade recovery are to be seen in a greatly increasdemand which is especially noticeable in the iron and steeltrades.   At the moment0 this country appears to be in.a morefavourable position than any other for meeting the demands,America having heavy arrears of work to make up and being unableto offer delivery except at very long dates*   The exchange rates are also an obstacle to America entering the UnitedKingdom market, as &quot;/ell as many foreign markets with manufacturegcodSc   Supply, however, is still far below normal and is notrapidly increasing.   The upward tendency of prices isunmistakable, quite apart from any adjustments necessary tomeet freight costs, and there are signs that the post warre-organisation is now taking shape and tha^i output, stimulated by the increased prices, may soon show a real improvement.The present outlook leads to the belief that the&apos;llimitingfactor in our industrial expansion for the next few years willbe the shortage of skilled labour,     Many important trade amalgamations have been announced during the period;  Of these may be mentioned the Glass TradeCombination in&quot;which the British Glass Industries ltd, has    ...acquired a controlling interest in Webbs Crystal Glass Company&quot;vhich is a combination of a large number of well-known glassmanufacturing firmsj  tho financial amalgamation of the ClydeShipbuilding and Engineering Company,  Messrs, Murdoch and Murray
AND FERGUSSON BROTHERS WITH J&quot;, SLATER,  (LONDON)  LTD,;THE FORMATION OF LILLYS OVERLAND CROSSLEY LTD,  TO ACQUIRECROSSL EY&apos; S LOTORS LTD., AND THE WILLYS OVERLAND  COMPANY;  ANDTHE ACQUISITION OF THE DUFFRYN TIN PLATA WORKS  BY THE  SYNDICATECONTROLLED BY IIR, LLEWELLYN DAVIS,     THE GENERAL FEATURE OF THE PERIOD HAS BEEN THE GREAT INCREASEIN DEMAND WHICH IS NOW MORE IN ADVANCE OF SUPPLY THAN  EVER,   MANYMANUFACTURERS HAVE RECENTLY DECLINED TO BOOK n.ny movs  ORDERS,.PARTLY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR SUPPLY BEING BOOKED  FOR SOME  MONTHSAHEAD AND PARTLY OWING TO UNCERTAINTY OF PRICE  CHANGES MADENECESSARY BY THE NEW RAILWAY RATES,   THE OUTPUT OF PIG  IRON ISSTILL FAR BELOW NORMAL AND IN SPITS OF THE DECREASE IN THE NORMALDEMAND DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF THE MOULDERS1  STRIKE,  NOW ENDED,THE SUPPLY REMAINS SHORT 0   THE ADVANCE IN PIG  IRON PRICES TOMEET INCREASED RAILWAY COSTS IS ABOUT 15/- a TON;  IN  considering this PRICE INCREASE IT IS NECESSARY TO REMEMBER  THAT THE  PRODUCTIONOF 1 TON OF PIG IRON INVOLVES THE CONSUMPTION OF SOME  Z\ TONS  OFCALCINED IRONSTONE, RATHER OVER HALF A TON OF HIW^ONE AND about one TON OF COKE EQUIVALENT TO SAY&apos;1^ TONS OF COAL.  THE NORTHEAST COAST IRON MASTERS HAVE FIXED PRICES FOR HOME AND CERTAINALLIED MARKETS BUT HAVE LEFT PRICES FOR OTHER MARKETS  OPEN.   ITIS NOT EXPECTED, HOWEVER, THAT AFTER HOME NEEDS HAVE BEEN MET.,THERE WILL BE ANY CONSIDERABLE QUANITY AVAILABLE TO MEET THEINCREASE IN FOREIGN DEMANDS,   THE IRON WORKS IN THE MIDLANDSPARTICULARLY ARE EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES WITH THEIR  fuel supplies,   MANUFACTURED &amp;R(M AND STEEL IS, PERHAPS, EVEN MORESCARCE THAN PIG IRON AND LITTLE BUSINESS IS PASSING AT THEMOMENT OWING TO THE GREATER DIFFICULTY OF ADJUSTING PRICES TO  THE..NEW COSTS,,   IT IS THOUGHT, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCREASE WILL be considerable,, THE TENDENCY HAVING BEEN FOR SOME TIME TOWARDS STTSADYADVANCES IN PRICES IN THE EFFORT TO EQUALIZE SUPPLY AND DEMAND,THIS TENDENCY HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE EVER SINCE THE LABOUR TROUBLESABROAD AND THE EXCHANGE DIFFICULTIES HAVE REMOVED THE  FEAR OFFOREIGN COMPETITION.   HEAVY ORDERS ARE BEING PLACED BY EUROPEAN  .AND COLONIAL COUNTRIES FOR RAILWAY AND CONSTRUCTIONAL  MATERIALS.     TIN PLATES ARE STILL a VERY STRONG MARKED  AND PRICES AREADVANCING DAILY, BEING NOW IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF 60/-  PERSTANDARD BOX.   IT MUST BE NOTEDI HOWEVER, THAT THE PRICES OFSHEET BARS AND TIN ARE ALSO RISING RAPIDLY,   IN SPITE OF THIS.PRODUCTION IS STILL LOW OWING, IT IS SAID, TO RAILWAY CONGESTION  IAND THE IRREGULARITY OF SUPPLIES OF FUEL AND STEEL AND THE &apos;SHORTAGE OF SKILLED LABOUR ACCUSTOMED TO THE WORK.   IT  IS HOPEDTHAT IMPROVED MACHINERY WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN INTRODUCED will soon EFFECT AN IMPROVEMENT IN THIS RESPECT.   THERE IS an enormous DEMAND FOR HORNS AND EXPORT TRADE AND MOST MAKERS AREBOOKED UP SIX MONTHS AHEAD.   THE GENERAL SHORTAGE AND inability of MAKERS TO MAKE AGREEMENTS EXCEPTING FOR DATES FAR FORWARD is causing SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES TO SOME OF THE TIN BOX AND TINPLATE WORKS,   THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THOUGH AT PRESENT IN ASTRONG POSITION THE TIN PLATE WORKS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE  REALLYIN A STATE OF COMPARATIVE WEAKNESS BY REASON OF THE comparatively small SCALE ON WHICH MANY WORKS OPERATE AND. OF  THE faovMn BUTFEW INSTANCES DO MAKERS CONTROL EFFECTIVELY TBEIR SUPPLIES OF  RAWMATERIALS.
     GALVANISED SHEETS, THE SUPPLY OF WHICH, LIKE THAT often PLATE, WAS RESTRICTED DURING THE WAR, ARE ALSOEXPERIENCING A VERY GREAT POSTPONED DEMAND, NEARLY all for EXPORT TRADE,TOT-FBKHCAS &amp;2RIV&amp;S,     THE METAL TRADES, WHICH HAVE BEEN &quot;BUSY ON HOME ORDERSFOR SOME MONTHS, ARE NOW INCREASING IN EXPORT TRADE;  there being a  GOOD EXPORT DEMAND FOR SMALL HOUSE FITTINGS  ANDHOLLOW-WARE. WORK IS CONFINED MAINLY TO WELL-KNOWN LINES, aSHORTAGE OF SKILLED LABOUR PREVENTING AN EXPANSION INTO new business AT PRESENTS     THE RAW METAL MARKETS HAVE, DURING THE PERIOD UNDERREVIEW BEEN BUSIER THAT AT ANY TIME SINCE THE ARMISTICE,CCPPIR,     AFTER REMAINING FAIRLY STEADY DURING THE AUTUMN  AT ABOUT 100 A TON., THE PRICE OF COPPER SUDDENLY ROSE TOWARDS THE ENDOF LAST YEAR AND HAS NOW REACHED  120 a TON,   IT IS  EXPECTEDTHAT IN COMMON WITH OTHER NON-FERROUS METALS THE PRICE will go STILL HIGHER AS THE DEMAND INCREASES WITH THE IMPROVEMENTIN TRADE,TT S     THE STEADY INCREASE IN VALUE,  WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ONSINCE THE SUMMER,  HAS BECOME MUCH MORE MARKED IN THE  LAST FEW \WEEKS,   WITH THE BOOM IN THE TIN PLATE TRADE AND THE RESUMPTIONOF BUSINESS ON A LARGE SCALE IN AMERICA, THE DEMAND FOR TINHAS BEEN GREATLY INCREASED AND IT IS ANTICIPATED, THAT THEPRESENT PRICE, ABOUT  380 PER TON.  WHICH IS NEARLY EQUAL TOTHE HIGHEST PRICE ATTAINED CURING THE WAR, WILL BE CONSIDERABLYEXCEEDED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS,     TH.IS METAL ALSO SHOWS RAPIDLY INCREASING V^LUE.    AFTER THEREMOVAL OF THE WAR CONTROL THE PRICE FELL TO ABOUT  23 a TONAND REMAINED LOW THROUGHOUT THE EARLY PART OF THE YEAR.DURING THE AUTUMN THE PRICE HAS BEEN INCREASING STEADILYAND-HAS NOW REACHED.  48 A $ON.   THERE IS LITTLE . DOUBT THATA SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF THIS METAL IS. IN SIGHT,(3)
12. mrc         Steadily incroasing prices  are  alsoa foaturo  of  this market,    tho  war  time  control  price  already having boon  slightly    exceeded.   &apos;.i&apos;ho  present  scarcity  of ,&apos;Jinc concontratos  combined    with tho tm 11;  production of  Spoltor  during 1919 will result    in short Zinc supplies  for  some  time  to como.IS,, flaU0I!!a^IHQ  IKaj^S,        &apos; ^iLoro^is a-groat  demand for  all products of Engineering    industries, it  is  estimated tho Homo  trado has sufficient orders    to keep works going at  full pressure  for  the next two years, and  tho ovorsoas trado  is remarkably  activo as  far as booking orders    is concerned.       Most of the programmes of the largo firms have however boon    dolaysd by the shortage  of castings caused by tho Moulders strike,    by the great congestion  of railways and sidings and by the lack    of adequate supplies of  fuel.        Important shipbuilding developments are being undertaken by   many, largo firms, Railway and -framway work is as brisk as tho   presnnt labour and transport position allows,  (Tt was reported   recently that Messrs, Armstrong ^hltworth are extending their   works at Scotswwod to make it an important centre for constructing   locomotives,         here is still a pronounced tendency towards amalgamation of   Capital and consequent extensions of engineering and manufacturing   establishments, and also a tendency for largo firms to acquire   controlling interests in concerns supplying their raw material,        ,:j?here is no apparent sign of a decrease in prices,  and  wages   appear likely to remain at a high level,   (In the stool and  ,   Engineering Industries generally a further revision of wages  in   an upward direction is in progress,        ,In. the  brass trade  it has bo come  impossible  to produce a  number of articles  in  common use  for  lack of moulds,   Some of  the  machine tool shops  have  been closed  till  fresh  supplies  of   castings  become  available and  lack of  tools has had an adverse   effect  on  the  production of  come  works in  tho Midlands.        She motor car  industry  is receiving largo  offers  of  business  from  all parts  of the  world,  but  again production has  been  disorganised by  the Moulders  rjtrike.        As a generalization the Ulectrical Engineering trades are  fully booked with orders,        &apos;Hho Most  important  event  to  record in  the period under  review is the  settlement  of the Moulder1s  Strike which has had  such  a disastrous effect  on industry during  the past months,
14.   *  TlgTIIBS,         The froollen. Industry.  Tho first series of Government    OeloniaOool auctions opened on 12th January.  Prices remained    firm at about the Damo&apos;level as in last Dooemberfl   Demand is    still brisk for merino,  and fine cross-bred descriptions,    lower grades being withdrawn frequently for lack of    offers.,    Enquiry for tho homo market is strong, whilst that of the    neutrals is moderate.15. -  .   The demand for woollens and worsteds is very heavy and  shows    no signs of slackening either, at home or abroad.  Manufacturors    aro unablo to copo with  it,  and many are full up with orders    until almost the end of  the  year.  Disappointment is felt at    the fruitless efforts to persuade the wool combers to oontinuo    overtime.  There is little chance of cheaper goods until tho    output from oomba and spindles can be increased, even though    prices of raw wool may decline slightly.  There is a marked    shortage of labour (oapeoially women) and in-the Bradford    district a good deal of  machinery is standing idle on this    account.  Tho high wages now obtaining have altered to a certain    extent tho outlook on life and labour Ytfiich would,  under old    condition, have gone to  the  mill now refuso3 to regard such work  a    the manual ;fca&amp;&amp;.16. - :*  OOTEOfy         (Mho cotton trade continues to experience the  prosperity    of the last few months.  &quot;The margin of profit iin yarn and  cloth    romains exo^o&amp;ingl^ wide, and there appear to be no signs of  the    demand abating,  Messrs  Tattersail express tho opinion that    no relief for buyers can bo  expected before March at tho    earliest,  Shipments of  cloth for the last nine months are  still 1   behind the pre-war figure, although a big trade has been done.17* IV.  The sale of Mills at high prices still continues.  It  must    however, be remembered that  tho companies have usually a large    loan &apos;.; :  capital at low interost which does not share in tho    increased values-  As much as six or eight times tho nominal    value of the shares has  boen paid;  and shareholders have been    eager in many cases to roinvest in tho new concern. &quot;Up to  the    end of last year about 180 mills had; changed hands.         These very high selling prfc-ossmay in the  future result    in difficulties arising  from over QPp41*&amp;U4^9a  Certainly  such-    mills as have not increased  their capital unduly will at a    later date find themselves in a strong position.
18.    .    The supply  of  raw material  still  causes anxiety..     Some American sources of  information indicate that the    American crop will considerably exceed  tho estimates,    Messrs, NoillBrgs, however refuse to inor&amp;aoe thoir estimate of    the seasons ^crop - namely 11,700,000 balesn  It is considered    that tho additional  cotton coming into  sight beyond this    figure is unfit for  English spinnors to use,  Messrs Neill&apos;a    tentative figure for tho world1s consumption of American    cotton is 12,500,000 bales,19,    ,   Tho main feature with regard to Egyptian cotton is the    rapid rise in nrlcos since 1st January.  On that date Spot    quotations lor1,,G,F,,;Sakel stood at 55f00 and had reached    68,00 by 14th January,  at which figure they stand to-day.    ,It,is worth noting that 168,000 bales of cotton have been&apos;    shipped from Alexandria to tho U.3.A, since 1st August,&apos;&apos;    1919, as against 12,000 bales for tho samo period last yeary    The figure of 168,000 bales does not include cotton bought    in&apos;Liverpool for the U.S,A,  which is estimated at about    34,000 bales.    sine,    &quot;v    The silk trade  is at present in a very satisfactory .-    condition,  most firms boing busy and booked up well ahead    with good orders,. It is felt by some peoplo in the    industry, that this prosperous condition is only temporary    and that/owing to the adverse rate of exchange and low    priced labour in Japan a good doal of trado is boing lost    to this country, and it is feared that more still will go    as Japan develops,  On the 7th January the President received    a deputation from the National Joint Industrial  Council on.  :    the 3ij&amp;&apos;fIndustry to ask him to consider those points,    and inti^oduce legislation to protect the. Industry *     -  &apos;.&apos;--&apos;         mg^        ,                                 &apos;   &apos;         The position 1B this trade is very satisfactory.   Orders    are flowing in at high  prices, particularly for  yarns  for    which record prices have boon obtained,  As there is a    big strike, of&quot;jute operators in Caloutta for higher Wages and    shorter hours,  l)undee will not doubt benefit.         OJSers  &quot;have been coming in very heavily for  some  time  ,.    past and practically  all manufacturers  are  full up  for seme    months  aheado  ,Prices show an upward tendency  owing to  the    high prices  of worstod4  woollen and cotton yarns.  The  output    of the  trado is  still unsatisfactory owing to  the shortage&quot;    of weavers *   Tho question of  increasing the supply  of  labour    is receiving the attention of the  National  Joint  Industrial  -    Council for  tho  Carpet  Industry,        !mi  shortage  of  flax is  still  a leading feature of  this,    trade*  &quot;Hopes are  entertained  that  quantities  may be    available from Russia- in tho next  few months,  but nothing    definite is  known*  A small quantity of  flax from Holland    fetched the  astonishing  price  of  900 per ton  recently,    Spinners .are  quite unable  to meet  the demands  for yarns  owing    to the  restricted  output with  the result that  practically all    spinners are refusing orders for certain numbers  of yarns.
The demand for cloth is very strong, &quot;but owing to thedifficulty in obtaining yarns, output is limited, 5i&apos;*nu, acturors arc endeavouring to work 8/llths, of normal,hut it is doubtful if the supply of yarns will enable themto keep up this production, Firms are booked up with all thoorders they can oxocuto for a considerable period in advance,  ..  HQSIJSRY JAO;J my MBSOIIBKY.     These industries are working to their full capacity,being well supplied with orders.  Great difficulty is oeihgexperienced in obtaining cotton yarns of tho finer grades,and tho Board has boon askod for assistance as large iUantitios are boing exported.     The foreign hido market is now oasier; for some time the English tanners have practically withdrawn from the youth  : American Market and tho offoot is now being soen in the fall of prices  for raw hides both in North and South America, though they arc still high.  Tho retention of tho control of native hides until the ond of January at least have be on welcomed, especially by the tanners,     Tho heavy demand for leather continuas, good class upper leathers being greatly sought after,  Government prices for tanned Kast IndisnKids havo recently baen advanced and tanners aro also generally increasing their prices.     Tho boot and shoo manufacturing trado remains busy, a large number of contracts being still on hand,  Thore is said to be soma slackening in demand from tho home market, * and it is thought that compotition between manufacturers &quot; for orders instead of between buyers for goods may obtain again soon.  But at present tho export trade is capable of great expansion, this country having an advantage in comparatively cheap leather and&apos;a favourable exchange for oxport to many important markets, and a falling off in the total demand need nd bo expected for some time to come,  ,  CHEMICAL PRODUCTS,     ffie demand for hiOi vy Chemicals continuas to be considerably in excess of the supply and prices are still tonding upwards.Manufacturers are fully booked with orders for delivery. during the next three months,  The chief problem is how to produoo the goods quickly enough and how to obtain transport facilities by reason of shortage of trucks.  The difficultyas regards tho carriage of raw materials is a dominating faotor. and the shortage of fuel has also an adverse effect,     ,The demand for oxport shows no diminution but chemicals almost without exception are in short supply.  There aropractically no surplus stocks at makers1  works and new orders are taken without any guaranteo as tc delivery,  ,Tho conditions of labour and tho uncertainty of getting goods to any particular destination by rail or sea aro causing considerable embarrassment&apos; to directors and managers.     The market for coal-tar dye intermediates is still verydifficult and makers are practically fully sold for the majority of products,  Carbolic Acid crystals arc reported to be almost off tho market,  Naphthaline is in short supply.  Thereis a serious shortage of Aniline oil and salt and also ofBetanapthol,
          The  abnormal  demand for dyostuffa and tho shortage     experienced  is  apparently due  to the sudden boom in the     textile and  paper  making trades,          Tho  curtailing of export licences for intermediates     and dyestuffs will it is hoped help manufacturers to     cope  with tho difficulty,       *   PAPER.  Xn  contrast with the prevailing fear of foreign     competition  in  paper common in tho early part of last year,     the trade now takos the viow that this country is at least     as well able to socuro overseas markets as any other in     its own lines.  Although the difficulties caused by     shortage  of skilled labour and small supplies of raw    material  are hampering increased production,  the mills are    now-bringing themselves nearer to pre-war standard and are.    more  satisfiod with tho uuaJtity  of their products,  Tho    mills are fully booked with.orders, largely for home    account and the export trade is growing;  the  exports for    1919 exceeding In quantity those for 1918 by  nearly 7.6$    -and boing about 25^ of the pre-war standard,         The  pulp position is  causing&apos;some  anxiety.  Our supplies    arc mainly drawn from Scandinavia, but  tho increased cost    of production and tho  scarcity of fuel  has reduced the    output in Northern fturnpo.   Although we have  obtained a small    tonnage&apos;from Canada,  the pulp position  is already -becoming :    serious,  and it is probable  that when trado roaohes its    normal level again some new field of supply of raw material    will require to be found,28*   ,  GLASSWARE,         5Hi production of illuminating glassware is advancing    tho output of miners ,T lamp glasses for December being    higher than for any other month during the year.  The optical    glass industry is in a less satisfactory position.  Both    producing firms havo boon working at a loss largely due to    the fact that one of them deliberately adopted a &quot;cutting&quot;    polioy. The other firm has stated that unless higher prices    can bo arranged it will be impossible to work at a profit,&apos;    and it is now believed that arrangements have boon made which    may rondor it possible    for both oompetitors to continue    running their works,         katnematioal and electrioal instrumont makers are    increasing their production, and aro well supplied with  &apos;  orders,30,    .   OILS,         Markets generally do not appear to have fully recovered    from tho Christarns and Wow Year Holidays and the period of    slackness during stocktaking,        Prioos of most soed oils show a firm tendoncy but    signs of any great activity are lacking and buyers are    inclined to hold back.         Since complete romoval of control towards the end of    tho paBt year prices have tendod to advance on aooount -    of increased working expenses.         In, the case of most oil soeds a large increase in    importation was&quot;shown during 1919 over that of the    preooding years, and a considerable export trade was done    in vegetable oils produced in the United Kingdom,
