Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  covering        Draft; Reply to Memorial&quot; presented to the  Prime Minister.          I circulate to the Cabinet the draft of a repjbyto the Memorial presented to the  Prime Minister in favourof calling an International Conference to consider thafinancial and economical conditions of Europe.(Intlld.)   A.treasury,  S.W.,    6th February,  1920.
         .     &apos;                             .   1        1   584  the Hon.  R.H.  Brand.  O.M.G.           iDear Mr. Brand,           His Majesty^ government have  had  under consideration.-tion the Memorial,  dated the 15th January,  vfoteh wasforwarded by you to the Prime  Minister on behalf of thefifteen signatories, proposing that the Governmentsof the countries chiefly concerned which  should  includethe.United states,  the United lingjiom and the british dominions,  France,  Belgium,  Italy. Japan, Germany,  Austria,the fieutral countries of &amp;urfcqpe and the chief exporting countries of South American should. be invited forthwith to convene a meeting of financial representatives for thepurpose cf  examining the present financial and economicsituation off the world, and in the event  of their decidingthat co-operative assistance is necessary and advisable  torecommend tt whom and by mfeom assistance  should be given and on what general conditions.        His Majesty1 s Government understand that an identical Memorial wan simultaneously presented by representa-tive  citizens to certain of the other Governments named in the memorial, and that an analtgous but not identical Memorialwas alec presented to the Government, of the United States ofAmerica by representative American ejttifeens.        On the 3rd instant I had the pleasure on behalf  ofHis Majesty^ Government in company with twc  of my colleagues of meeting the majority of the British signatories to the memorial, and of obtaining in the course  of an informal discussion further explanations of the views of the Memorial-ists on the important subjects to which it relates.   In. accordance with my promise I have reported tha resultsof that discussion to the Cabinet and on behalf of HisMajesty*s Government I net make the following reply.          The piture whioh the Memorial presents of thefinancial and economic oonditions resulting from the War,                                                and
and of the grave economic and social dengers -which inconsequence confront the whole woicld,  is not,  in theopinion of His Majestyls Government, exaggerated.  Allthe information in their possession convinces them of  the urgency of the problems to which the Memorial draws attention and of the added danger which arises from the widespreadexistence of false hopes and illpsians and the absenceof any general recognition of hard facts which,  as the memorial sets forth, are obscured by the apparent plentiful-ness of money resulting from the continuous growth in  thevolume of outstanding currency and of Government, obligations.        The Memorial lays stress on tha  need for bringinghome to the paopleB ef all countries tafaat until current expenditure is brought within receipts from taxation andother regular inoome, a Government oaanot be treated asa solvent debtor fit to reoeive further financial helpin the form of new credits for reconstructive purposes,  sadis on the sure road to bankruptcy and anarchy,   I will  return .to this point teter.          The Memorialists recognise that Germany and austria must bear t&amp;e largest pcs BIBLE burden that they maysafely assume but they add that the sorpe of the annual(contribution which they will be called upon by the ReparationCommission to undertake must, for the JPTLCA of their creditorsand for the safce of the future social and economic develop-ment ef the WORLD, be brought within the limits within whichsolvency can be preserved.   His Majesty*8 Government  oaanotanticipate the conclusions which the Separation commission may reach in regard to this matter, but&apos;the statement  ofprinciple in the Memorial is in acccrdemoe with the TIEWSadopted throughout by His Ba4esty&quot;s Government aaid with  T&amp;Eprovisions of the Treaties of Poace themselves.- a -
       The Memorial suggests that while much can be cbne throughnormal banking ^lannols, the working cap ital needed to enablethe various European countries to purchase the imports requiredfor reH3tsxtdjig the circle  of exchange, to restore theirproductivity and to re-organise their currencies,  is too large in amount and is required too quickly for suoh channels to be adequate, and thoy express the opinion that a more comprehensive scheme is necessary   They propose,  therefore!, that a Conferenceof financial representatives should be summoned to survey thesituation and to suggest some such comprehensive scheme ofinternational co-operation in the grant of credits, and theysketch in broad outlir.es certain general conditions under whichsuoh credits might be granted.       The Memorialists recognise that sach-co-operative aotion,if undertaken at all, cannot be confined,  to any particulargroup of countries.   fo quote the words of the Memorial, *Theinterests of the vhole of Europe and indeed of the whole WJrldare at stakeMe and if saooess is to be obtained all must co-operate where all are oonoeroed.    The hope of useful results from the deliberations of such a Conference must in fact dependon the extent to which the participation of the various countries mentioned in the first paragraph of the Memorial is secured.       Under these circumstances the changes introduced into the American Memorial and attitude of the Government ofthe United States become matters of first rate importancein the canaideration of the course to be adopted byHie ttajesty^s Government.       Apart from a significant omlsBion in the bodyof the Memorial, the American Memorial differs from thatpresented to His Majesty^ Government and to other european governments in that it dees not ask that the conference should be called by Governments or that Governments should participate in it but suggests that the Chamber of Commerceof the United States should designate representatives ofCommerce and finance to meet with those of other countries.
       n Is EFCEAR tfm% the V*.ite4 tttstcf (fcmsrameat        587would not be presented et such a conference.     It is not clear that it **ould encourage the nomination  of representa-tives by the Chamber of Commaroe.       It is obvious that this decision of tfce UnitedStates Government must gravely affect the influenae and eventhe utility of suoh a oonferanee as is proposed, and. but forone consideration urged by you His Majesty^  Government would have regarded it as fatal to your proposal.   But  in conversationwith my colleagues and myself you and the other gentlemenwho accompanied you. whilst explaining that you had afcvercontemplated large loans by Government to Government,  argued that ssceh a conference would exercise a powerful influence in securing those measures of internal reform in the oeuntitesconcerned which would not only be a necessary preliminary  .to say further assistance by foreign Governments but are equallynecessary as a preliminary to any extension of commercialcredits; amd yeu expressed the belief that the exaoutitn ofthese internal reforms by stabilising the ourrenoies tf thecountries concerned wou^d lead t* the grant *f otnawroial creditson suoh a scale that any Government assistance which might stillbe found neoessary wauld be reduced te comparatively small amounts and need only be given within striotly defined limits,       His Uajestyfs Government recognise that there is foroe Inthis oontentitzw    She sifoetien is sa grave that they are unwilling to omit any act whioh may help to alleviate itor may bring home te 41 concerned In this country and else-rahere a true aj? preioaiton of the nature and character ofthe difficulties with which the world is confronted, andmay at the same time indicate the only methods by which they canbe overcome.     Under these oirooimstances His Majerty&apos;0Government tfhilst not prepared to take the initiative in ,summoning sunn a conference, will be prepared to appoint representatives if invited to do so by one of the tfeutralCountries or by the League of fiatlens, on being satisfiedthat the Conference will asrrame a really representativeohar                          f 4 -

They ar* impressed with the futility ofattempts to solve the grave problem of reconstructionby a ^ntinuoug process of new borrowing, whether in theform of internal loans to cover defiolts on  current--&amp;rpendl-.ture, or in the fbrm of external loans advanced by one government to another.   They have themselves laid dawnas a oardinal feature of their own policy the cessation ofnew borrowing by the British Government and  the establishmentof an adequate sinking fund for the reduction of debtout of revenue,  and have publicly stated that they are notprepared to grant further advances to other  Governments.Such advances involve either new borrowings  by tha  lendingGovernment 0* the taxation of its nationals  for thepurpose of making loans to the Governments of other countries,and His Majesty^ Gowiinment cannot in view  of the  immenseliabilities which this oountry has already assumed in the prosecution of the ^ar adopt either of these alternatives.       Hie Majesty&apos;8 Government have however felt itnecessary, in fulfilment of what they conceive to be theduty of the United Kingdom to make a contribution.worthy of the traditions of tbe  nation, to the reconstruction of Bur-ope, to admit certain particular exceptions to  thegeneral principle that loans from Government to Governmentshould cease.   They are at the present  moment engaged indisouasions with the Governments of Cam da,  the United Statesof imerioa, France and certain other countries, Ire ludingsome nfcich did not take part in the VJar,  in  regard to theprovision of Government credits to Austria and Poland f&amp;wthe supply of foodstuffs and raw materials axffioien.1;   .                                                  to
 to enable those countries to avert famine and restart industrial life.   His Liajesty!s Government felt compelled publicly to state in November last that,  however desperate tho need,&quot;they oould not participate in measures of relief unless they were assured of the oo -operation of t&amp;e Government of the  United States, of America to an extent which would make  it oertain that this country would not be called upon to inour additional expenditure in the United iitates of America.    The movements ef the foreign exchanges since Uovember last emphasise the diffioulty with which His Majeety&apos;s Government were then confronted In order therefore to avoid any possible misconception Hits Majesty^ Government desire to make it absolutely clear that,  if they were te agree to take part in a Conference  such as the Memorialists propose it TO uld not be with the idea that it was possible for the United Kingdom it this stage to make any considerable addition to its liabilities and that if the grant of credits in any form were to be recommended by the Conference, His Majesty!s Government could not support or take a share in any sofceme which involved an addition to the liabilities of the United Kingdom&apos; for expenditure in America.
