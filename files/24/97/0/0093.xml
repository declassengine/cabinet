J&apos;     His Urituv-ij y^o^^G3v^^Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.AOTHE  TURKISH  PEACE.        . S.... .  L.L continuation of  CP. 590, I now circulate to my colleagues the latter half of^ ^Lk^jffiie^legrani  from the  Viceroy, Home  Department, dated 3rd February, which has         just reached me.                                                                               E.S.M.18                 (J.) From Viceroy, Home Department (undated).                        (Received 5th February, 11.45 a.m.)    Part  2.   Continuation  of  Home  Department  telegram  of  2nd  February.Extremist agitators nevertheless clutch at every chance of  discrediting Indian  and home  Governments, and exciting   anti-British  and  pro-Turkish  feeling.  Thusforcible contrast is drawn between rumoured  backing by  France of Turkey&apos;s claimto lenient treatment on one hand and  Times recent advocacy of Turkish evacuation of Constantinople on the  other  hand.  Stress  is  also laid, on  such  incidents asatrocities alleged to have been committed by Greeks at Smyrna.   We are not awareto what extent the agitation  here  is  linked rip  with the pan-Islamic movement inEgypt,  Asia Minor, Syria, and  Central Asia, hut  we  have no doubt that someconnection does  exist, and it is certain that existing conditions in these areas, togetherwith  frontier tribal hostilities,  uncertainty regarding Afghan  intentions,  and  theBolshevik  menace a movement, which,  in parts of Asia is more  pan-Islamic thanBolshevik are utilised  by agitators to convey impression that  Allied  Powers havenot really won Avar, and that  position of British Empire is  by no  means  so secure as government  pretend.   In   estimating importance  of such statements, it  must beremembered  that Mohamedan masses are ignorant people who are  easily deluded.     As regards  Bolshevik influences, Ave have  no evidence Bolshevik  agents havereached   India  started  direct   propaganda,  but certain  extremists,  e.q.,  BepinChandra Pal, have been  presenting Bolshevik theories in (? most)  favourable light.The feeling  aroused by public enquiry into the Punjab disorders has also addedgreatly to difficulty of  situation.   Prevailing industrial unrest shown in pendingstrikes  furnishes favourable medium,  of which  advantage likely to be taken forpropagation of Bolshevik doctrine.  Still more favourable to success of  anti-Govern-ment agitation is (? continuance of) high prices, in spite of generally good harvest, a fact which cannot be understood by common people, and is attributed  by anti-Britishpropagandists in some vague Avay  to  the results  of alien  Government.   While  high prices  have  brought  prosperity  to  avell-to-do  cultivators, they are  causing muchhardship  to  small  ryots and landless labourers  in rural  areas, and  to  all town-dwellers,  including artisans,  clerks and others on small fixed incomes.     Viceroy took opportunity of recent visit  of  Heads of Provinces to Delhi forconference to consult them regarding extent to which extremist teaching has affected(a)  Mohamedans in  rural  areas ;  (6) religious  teachers  and  preachers;   and (c)Mohamedan  rank and file in Army and police.   Views of Heads  of  Provinces are,on   the  whole,  reassuring,  though   there is general  consensus of  opinion  that position has worsened  since Local Governments appealed in May last to respectableMohamedans to  exorcise steadying influence  on  Moslem   opinion.  Heads  ofProvinces do not anticipate  trouble  in rural  areas.   They are apprehensive  thattrouble may occur in certain large  towns, but unless the external situation developsunfavourably, and the  loyalty of troops or police  becomes  affected,  they  do  not anticipate any serious difficulty in handling situation that may arise.   Such outbreaks of  disorder  arc, in their opinion,  likely to be sporadic rather  than wholesale  ororga           (2)  From Viceroy, Home Department, &apos;6rd February 1920.                             (Received 6th, 1 pan.)    Part 3.   Continuation of Home Department telegram of 2nd February.    As regards religious teachers,  general  opinion is that, while  they have not as awhole yet joined the Extremists, some have succumbed to the influence of exhortations   &apos;  10  923    100  2,20
 such as delivered by the Ali  brothers, and  others may follow  their example, should this be necessary to retain their leadership.   No evidence is forthcoming that the spirit of  disaffection has  yet been  communicated to Mohamedans in  the Army and Police.  Their loyalty  is, however, subjected to considerable strain,  as they do not escape from the taunts of being party to the Turkish downfall.   The  argument  that Indian Mohamedans  cannot,  in conformity with their religion, serve in the Army against a  Musalman Power,  is being sedulously  propagated and, if it is developed, might have serious results upon recruitment and  upon staunchness of those already in the service.     We concur in the view of the heads of provinces that, unless there be unexpected developments outside India, the final settlement with Turkey, even if unfavourable, is not likely to provoke wholesale or organised disorder within  India, for there are many reassuring facts in situation to which  reference has not been made above, such  as  the  consolidation of  opinion  in  favour of  the Government during  the recent Afghan hostilities, horror of invasion or any action likely  to promote this, the attitude  of the Indian Princes, recent memory of effective use that can  be made of military force in suppressing disorders, growth of a Nationalist Indian feeling which is  opposed to pan-Islamic idea, recent rally  of Moderates  at Calcutta Conference, apprehensions of sober-minded Indians  created  by  violence  and  bad  taste  of Extremist speeches and writings, common sense of the masses of people, particularly of those  with stake in the country,  weakness of the sympathy for  Turkey among Shia Avho are, however, not numerically strong.     We are asking Local Governments, through their local officers (Commissioners and District Officers) to  get  into close touch again with local public opinion, and to &apos; arrange interviews  with leading Hindus and Mohamedans ; to exhort Mohamedans to accept the decision, whatever it may  be, with resignation, laying  stress on various aspects of the case which have  already  been emphasised by  Bis Excellency in his reply  to the Khalifat deputation, and sounding  them as to the  attitude of religious preachers  and of  the masses ;  to  warn Hindus of  the  danger of supporting  the Extremist Khalifat  movement,  pointing out  encouragement  which this movement, more  particularly if it produces  outbursts of internal disorder, will afford  to the Bolsheviks and pan-Islamic forces outside India, which, coupled with tribal hostilities on the frontier and the uncertain attitude of Afghanistan, constitute a serious menace to the peace and prosperity of India, and exhorting them not to excite by  over-sympathy the fauaticism of  their Moslem  brothers, but rather to appeal to their  common sense and  to joint interest of  India, Moslem and Hindu, in&apos;the development of India under the Reforms Scheme.     We trust  action thus  taken may do much to stabilise position, but we desire to emphasise  both the extreme desirability  of  a  speedy termination of  the  present uncertainty, which makes  the situation more difficult for us the longer it is prolonged, and  the immense  advantage that  will accrue to  our  position, vis-a-vis Indian iVloha-medans,  if  favourable  terms for  Turkey  are  secured.   These  will  not  satisfyExtremists, but they will soothe general Mohamedan feeling, and at the  same timeto some extent reduce external menace by discouraging Bolsheviks, pan-Islamists and Afghan intriguers.
