(11503)                            POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,                                                   FOREIGN OFFICE.                                                             DENMARK/ 009.                              MEMORANDUM                                      ON          THE LUTKEN EPISODE AND DANISH NEUTRALITY.     TOWARDS the end of last year the Danish Government published as a BlueBook the documents and discussion dealing with the conversations between CaptainL. C F. Lutken and &quot;certain officers of  the German  General  Staff in  1902-03 and1906-07.  The discussion  arose as a not unnatural by-product of the work of theCommission dealing with  the fortifications of Copenhagen, which in their present form date from the Act of 1909.   By the terms of this Act the land fortifications wereto be demolished in 1922; and in considering the feasibility of anticipating this date the Commission drifted on to a discussion of the reasons which  brought about thedecision in 1909 to postpone the disarmament for some twelve  years.   The decisionsembodied  in the Act referred to were reached by  an agreement  between the  threeparliamentary groups,  two of them represented in the Government.   The attitudeof the third, of which M. ,T. C. Christensen was then leader, could only be revealed bya study of the transactions of M. Christensen and his protege, Captain Lutken.   TheChairman of the Commission, M. Munch, the War Minister, traversed the main facts of the episode  in a careful speech, and  the point was so obvious that a prolongeddiscussion took place as to M. Christensen&apos;s real attitude in the  negotiations.  &quot; Ithink it a pity that when we are always being accused from that  side of being pro-German we should not make public the information we possess,&quot;* said M. Rasmussenat the first  discussion; and this statement gives  the motif of the long-drawn-outdebates which  were often extremely pointed, seldom logical, and rarely sincere.   TheGovernment tacticians pleaded for secrecy, but so turned the discussion that at lengththe demand for publication came from  Christensen&apos;s side.  While the Blue  Bookcontains 210 columns,  the  documents occupy less  than  a  third  of the space; butthe main facts can he stated shortly, and in view of M. Christensen&apos;s position and thepossibility of his not remote return to the premiership  it is of importance to examinethe role he played in the conversations.   The purpose  of the present memorandum isto enable  us to  answer the question how  far  was M. Christensen prepared to go beyond  the permissible precautions  of a  weak neutral in  his  negotiations  withGermany.     M. Christensen has declared himself  friendly  to this  country, and it is quite possible to distinguish  between  the friendship of free choice and  political (or effec-tive) friendship.  Whether M.  Christensen&apos;s friendship belongs to the second cate-gory, whether he can be depended upon as  a friend  in the only sense that matters in political groupings, is not a matter which can be determined by professions alone.     Captain Lutken went to Berlin in November 1902  as a paid official of the KultusMinisterium, t and for the last six months of his nine months&apos; stay there was attachedto the General Staff.   His role at once began to raise  anxious  thoughts in the mind of the Danish Minister in Berlin.  Deuntzer, the Premier and Foreign Minister, onthe 13th December had to inform Lutken that his commission did not include the&quot; political orientation &quot; of the two countries.  The  Government would be pleased tohave any &quot; special military information &quot; he might  gather; but beyond that his visithad no &quot; political significance.&quot;   After this Lutken stated that he was &quot; using hiseyes  and ears for purely military matters &quot;; but his interests  apparently wanderedonce more, for  the War Minister^ is found asking the Premier whether Lutken hasany mission from the Foreign Office, and then M. Christensen asks  M. Deuntzer if he cannot extend  &quot; those instructions.&quot;   Lutken was, of  course, flying at  higher gamethan &quot; special  military information.&quot; as he clearly  reveals  in  his  report of the 3rdOctober to the Foreign Office.  When he gets to know  people, he says, he gives themto understand that he knows &quot; many Danish politicians &quot; and is &quot;  verv  interested in* Col. 27.    f Now represented by two Ministries: Public Instruction and Ecclesiastical Affairs.

a rapprochement between Denmark and Germany,&quot; the chances of which he  thinks&quot; better than ever before.&quot;*   In a later report he shows&apos;that the German Staff wereeven then concerned about Denmark&apos;s  position in a European conflict.   Their  con-clusion is : &quot; If we cannot depend upon yon altogether during a great war we  mayjust as well annihilate you at the beginning.&quot;!   A month later (December 1903) theKing of  Denmark visited Potsdam and had a conversation with the Kaiser.   It  isnow the chances of a war between Russia and Japan which forms the theme.  the kaiser considered it unavoidable,  and communicated the results of a conference withthe Tsar.  In case of such a war and the possibility of an attack on the Baltic  fleetby the British and American fleets,  Germany was prepared to support Russia.  Theposition  visualised  by the Kaiser was  a British and American attack on Denmarkin preparation for an attack in the Belts or the Sound.   In such an eventuality Den-mark would not be able to resist the opening of the entrances to the Baltic (why  shouldshe? it might be asked).   The  German fleet would therefore  blockade these waters,and as payment would demand from Denmark that she should  declare herself neutraland prepare to defend herself as  far as lay in her power.  This would be to makeDenmark an ally; but no suspicion of this seems to have troubled the Kaiser&apos;s mind,and the first part of the Liitken episode ended  on this note.  Deuntzer would not extend the instructions.  Liitken would not resume the conversations without somelarger commission.            *           *             *             *             *    Before the second part  of the  episode opened  the political  atmosphere  had changed  considerably. After his  persuasive  conversation with Christian IX the kaiser urged  the Tsar to approach the Danish King  and ask him  to  submit his proposals as to the preservation of Danish neutrality  to &apos;&quot;us&quot;H (the Tsar and the kaiser).   In a later visit to Denmark the Kaiser notes that he had learned throughIsvolsky  that Count Raben (the Danish Foreign Minister) and a number of persons of influence have already become convinced that in case of war and impending  attack in the Baltic by  a  foreign Power  the  Danes expect that  their inability to uphold&quot; even the shadow of neutrality against invasion &quot;  being evident, Russia and  Ger-many will immediately take steps to safeguard  their interests by &quot; laying hand onDenmark and occupying it during the war, as this would at the same time guarantee the future existence of the dynasty of the country.   The Danes are slowly resigningthemselves to this alternative and  making up their minds accordingly.&quot;1  Such adiagnosis could not be justified in detail.   But the  broad  effect suggests with suffi-cient  accuracy the  atmosphere in wmich M.  Christensen became Premier in 1905.His attitude to Lutken has already been indicated by the fact that he pleaded withDeuntzer for an extension of the instructions  which restricted the young soldier  topurely military  affairs, and  the second part of the  episode  has a wholly different character.    General v. Moltke, who  had  succeeded Schlieffen  as  Chief of  Staff, invitedCaptain  Lutken, now an  official  of the  Ministry of  War, to  meet  him  on the&quot; Preussen &quot; on  the 18th February,  1906..  The General prefixed his remarks  by thestatement that what he had to say w7as the result  of an intimate conversation betweenthe Kaiser, Billow,  and himself France and England (the omission of Russia is  ofinterest) are nowTthe enemies, and Moltke fears a landing at Esbjerg or Lindfjorden.&quot; If you side with England or allow England to use your territory or raise one fingeragainst us, it is my opinion that Denmark&apos;s last hour will have struck. .  . .  Youwill take one side or the other.** Otherwise you will find yourself in such a position that you  will be  in it up to the neck, with both parties  as your enemies.   You mightjust as well make up your minds as to which way you want to go, and then we can make arrangements beforehand. We are  ready  to do this whenever you like; but itmust  be honest.   You must not negotiate with us and  then go to England.&quot;ft   Inview of this warning it is perfectly clear why  M. Christensen did not approach thiscountry, and the evasions of Christensehs side cannot obscure the point.    The Danish Minister in Berlin had a conversation with the Chief of Staff on similar lines, which he reported to  his Foreign Office on the  31st March; but therewas a significant addition.  Moltke did  not  wish to  have  political negotiations    * Col. 49.         t                              t Col. 50.    t  The correspondence in the &quot;Morning Post&quot;  in which the Kaiser encourages the Tsar to stand forChristendom against  the East is an apt commentary on this opinion.

&apos;&apos; which might attract attention ....  You can believe my words.   When whoeverI am speaking to can say the same thing, nothing further will he needed.&quot;*  this statement recurs again.     &apos;The word  of an honest man is  enough.&apos;    Moltke&apos;smeaning was plain enough.  He wanted  a definite assurance that in a European warthe rear of the  German armies  would  be  safeguarded  by Danish co-operation.Military conventions or political  agreements  might (or must) be  disclosed, and theplan would miscarry.  It is impossible to think that M. Christensen did not realise the lines upon which the conversations were now being carried on, yet we find thathe now drafted  the instruction to Captain Lutken, -which instruction  can only be interpreted by this background of plain talking by Moltke.    Under the signature &quot;Frederick R.&quot; the instruction was  sent to Liitken, andthe latter  read it to Moltke at their meeting on the 2nd July, explaining that it wasthe view  of  the Danish Government.!    Denmark, the instruction  stated, wouldmake energetic efforts to defend its neutrality, and  it was desirable that germany should recognise this &quot;in an agreement.&quot;  If such an agreement contained furthermatter and was,  for example, a military convention, it would be very serious for thefollowing reasons :  (1) Copenhagen&apos;s sea defences are at the moment too  weak  tobe able to beat  off a naval attack from a combined  Danish-German enemy;  (2) amilitary convention  would  be almost entirely to Germany&apos;&quot;s  advantage, while  itwould expose Denmark to  great loss, even to danger.   &quot; Such a thing the countryought  not to expose  itself to unless it  receives  distinct  advantages in return.&quot;Reading this careful statement in the  light of  the preceding  negotiations, it isimpossible to resist the conclusion that Christensen. feeling that he would be.driveninto compliance  with the German demands,  wished to secure some payment for hisconcessions.  The course of the conversation with Moltke gives  ample proof of this.Moltke stated that King Edward had promised Delcasse that it  (i.e., a landine;  mJutland) should  be tried, and if  so,  &quot;Denmark would have to bestir herself.&quot;  Heno longer counted  on Russia.   The next two  years he thought would bring about adebacle of Tsardom and the deposition  of the Tsar.  &quot;There would be a frightfulcommunistic  rising of the  Russian peasants, and an attempt on the  part of theGrand Dukes to carry  through a military dictatorship with or without the  Tsarwhich would be sure to fail. . .  . During a war with England  it would be a matterof life and death  to them  to  blockade the Great Belt,  and to do this they neededDanish territory, and they meant to use it. .  .  . .  We could go  with  England  orGermany; there was no third way  .... and we ought to know beforehand  what we  intended  to do.  A military convention should not be brought about now, evenif we decided in favour of  Germany,  as it might miscarry.&quot;    It was at this point that  the Danish Foreign  Minister attempted  to put abrake on  the negotiations  by asking the Danish  Minister in  Berlin to emphasise&quot;the absolutely  preliminary and  introductory&quot; nature  of  the conversations,  and a careful memorandum]: of the General Staff discussed Moltke&apos;s suggestions in detail.The Chief of Staff pointed  out that to continue the negotiations might be a danger.&quot; It might lead to a closer union than is desirable, or by breaking them off one maymake Danish political  circles suspicious and  the relationship  to Germany  moredifficult than ever.&quot;  He suggested &quot;a similar statement from  a  competent Englishauthority.&quot;  The reason why  this was not sought has already been  indicated.   TheGerman threat was too cogent.    Yet, despite the warning of the Chief of Staff, Liitken was allowed to continue his conversations; and on  the 8th March, 1907,  he assured Moltke  that althoughDanish home policy made  it difficult to  conclude any  definite  agreements &quot; allseriously minded Danish statesmen were certain that under no circumstances oughtDenmark  to  stand  side by  side with Germany&apos;s  enemies, and that  if, during an anglo-German war, it appeared  impossible for Denmark to retain  her neutrality,she would throw in her fortunes with Germany.&quot;  When taxed with the damagingeffect of this assurance Christensen admitted it to be serious; but the fact is he didnot attempt  to correct it.   Moltke naturally said that the statement pleased himgreatly.   &quot; War might come with England any moment ....  it was just as likelyit might come this year (1907) .  .  .  . war was in the air.&quot;  And he agreed with   * Col. 58.   f Col. 62.  The  Danish Government knew  nothing of the Instruction as is perfectly clear from thediscussions.  The Instruction was Christensen&apos;s work, the more guarded  letter of the Foreign Ministerbeing discarded.                             &apos;&quot;&quot;   I Col. 60-74.

 Captain Liitken that the greatest care should be taken to prevent England becoming suspicious of Denmark.     The rest is anti-climax.  TEe negotiations began to leak out.  Hints appeared in  &quot;Vort Land,&quot; in the &quot;Temps,&quot; in  the &quot;Daily  Telegraph.&quot;   The  British Ambassador in Paris is  found  to be suspicious,  and the Danish Charge d&apos;Affaires was instructed to let him know  through an intermediary that &quot; the Danish Govern- ment has carried out no negotiations with this Power (Germany) except  the Optant Children Convention of  the  11th January  this  year.&quot;   This was both true and untrue.  Christensen said he had never heard of this incident.  The conversations ceased; but  Christensen  said that they  resulted in the defence provisions of 1909. When these Bills  passed into law Christensen had  become War Minister.   The opposition to them held, quite  correctly, that they constituted  a preference  in one direction Germany and a monster petition was signed pleading for the dismissal of the Minister. It is clear that, whether through fear or  favour, probably more of the former than the  latter, Christensen  was prepared to go to unneutral lengths to placate Germany, and did,  as a fact, act as foster-father to defence measures which played into  Germany&apos;s hands;  and since the fear motive  has not yet passed from Danish politics we must  expect history  to repeat  itself if  the Minister  should once again come to power.    M. Christensen&apos;s manoeuvres  to evade  this  conclusion  are of  little interest outside Danish domestic  politics; but one piece justificative is  worthy of mention. Why did he not consult England, he was asked.  His reply was that a conversation was held  with  King Edward VII, presumably on his visit to Denmark in April 1908.  This was not in any way comparable with the prolonged discussions between the Danish and German military  authorities, but the account  of the conversation deserves record.  The account is by Count Frijs.*  &quot;Upon  my speaking of the many storm clouds which threaten the peace of Europe, and Denmark&apos;s difficult position, the King answered &apos; I think you are looking on the future  too pessimistically.  The causes for conflict  which  have been to the fore (Fashoda and the Morocco question) have been happily  disposed of.   This shows a decided  desire for peace in Europe; but I grant you that, with a man of the impulsive nature of the German Kaiser at the head of the world&apos;s greatest military power, anything may happen.  Should a European war  break out in  which  England also  took  part against   Germany, Denmark&apos;s position would be extremely precarious.   I do  not doubt that Denmark will do her utmost to safeguard her neutrality, and  I hope she  will succeed; but if Denmark&apos;s neutrality is  violated by her powerful southern  neighbour  I can onlysay that Denmark  cannot count on active help from England so  quicklyt that an occupation can  be prevented.  The sending of an English fleet to the Danish  seas is a dangerous thing  and cannot be expected,  at any rate not in the first phase of the war; but although Denmark cannot count on immediate military help from England, she can, supposing that she has  done all  to protect her neutrality, depend fully upon England, if she comes out of the war victoriously, to lay her whole influence at the final peace settlement in favour  of Denmark, and  then to settle guarantees against a future violation of Denmark.&apos; &quot;    It is characteristic of the rambling Danish method of conducting this enquiry that this conversation was only  revealed in the penultimate meeting of the Commis- sion.  The Blue Book, as  a whole, has not yet been examined anywhere except in the present memorandum.    January 29, 1920.                * Col. 163.                  t Italics as in the original.it
