PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Governor General  of  Canada to  theSecretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office, 0,35 a,m.  4th February,  1920).February 3rd.             Article If) Covenant of League of Nations.    Withreference to your cipher telegram of January 9th the despatchwith papers referred to have not arrived yet, but the terms  ofReservation No.14 have been carefully considered by the canadian government and they see no reason to modify position taken inreply to your telegram of November 8th regarding this Reservation.    The first part of this Reservation cannot be read as otherthan a direct challenge of the status of the Dominions  in theLeague of Nations and the denial of their right to vote.  TheCanadian Government, therefore,  is unalterably opoosed to anyassent, either by positive deolaration or by silence whichshould be deemed acquiescence, to this Reservation and if anyReservation is finally adopted &quot;by United States as part of its ratification which challenges the position or status of canadian  the League Canada will dissent therefrom and a protest against it acceptance will be filed and they will reserve full freedomof action under such conditions,    My Ministers do not under stand on what ground the UnitedStates could be given additional votes in the Assembly -withoutchanging the whole basis, of representation and voting.   Ifpopulation is chosen then the proportionate voting strength  inthe League of the British Empire would be more than double what it is at present and the voting strength of the United states would be correspondingly reduced.   If the United States is entitled to additional votes then ether Powers are equallyentitled and the voting ceases to be on the basis of member slapin the League and (?sor.s other)  rule equally applicable to all nations must be adopted.                                     imCNSHIRE.
