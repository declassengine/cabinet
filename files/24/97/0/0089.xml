)              MEMORANDUM BY TIPS FOOD CONTROLLER,1.          With reference to Cabinet 8 (20)  Conclusion 4 I have     consulted my responsible advisors as to  the  administrative     feasibility of the suggestion that meat  should be de-controlled     In England but that control should be maintained in Scotland     and Ireland.  They are still of opinion  that any attempt to     carry into effect this scheme would involve   administrative     chaos, heavy financial lose, and such general dissatisfaction as     to create a demand for the re-Imposition of  oontrol throughout     the United Kingdom which the Government  would find it hard to     resist?2,          The difficulties of course arise  in dealing with the     exportable surplus of Scottish and of Irish meat and livestock,     At present the farmer has the option of  selling his fat stock on     either a live weight or dead weight basis *  Probably throe-fourths  -   of the whole surplus is sold on the dead weight basis *  The  pro-     cedure at present adopted in respeot of  this Is as followss-5o          In the case of Scotoh cattle, the cattle are sent to  a     Government slaughterhouse where tho meat is  prepared for export,     chiefly for London*  It is consigned to  a wholesale meat associa-     tion established by the Ministry9 and it is  necessary for that meat     to realise the maximum price in order to reimburse the Ministry     for the price which has been paid to the Scottish farmere     Distribution from the London market is carried on through the same     organisations that deal with the English meat.4*          Irish cattle are chiefly slaughtered  at the port of entry.     The surplus meat not required for consumption Is despatched  to     London or other centre and dealt with on the same lines as ,the .     Scottish meat.  The essential part of the whole procedure is that     the wholesalers handling these supplies are agents of the Ministry     who are debarred from private trading and whose Interests in the     transaction are confined to the commission they r-eceive* In the     event of decontrol in England these associations of wholesalers     must necessarily be disbanded, as they would require to be at     liberty to conduct their own trader  Their services would there-     fore not be available for handling dead  meat on account of the     Ministry as they would be conducting their own businesses and no     other organisation could be set up for the purpose.  Por such a     technical business trade assistance is essential.  Inexperienced     Government agents could not possibly do  the  work in competition     with the trade.  It follows, therefore,  that the option of the     dead weight basis must be withdrawn and  this would be construed     by both Scottish and Irish farmers as a  breach of the original     understanding.  It would cause almost as much dissatisfaction as     if the whole bargain were denounced.5.          The Scottish and Irish farmers would therefore be limited     to the live weight basis.  So far as Scotland is concerned the     farmers would be in theory confined to their o?m markets as     hitherto, but it would be necessary to establish a staff of     inspectors, not only to prevent fat cattle crossing the border,     but to discriminate between fat stocks and store cattle, as     there is no restriction on the movement  of the latter.  One  of     two alternatives would have to be adopted.  Either the Ministry     would have to continue to slaughter the  Scotch cattle on its own     account and send the meat to the London  market, taking the risk     of profit or loss, or in the alternative, the London agents  would     be required to attend the Scottish markets and take such oattie
 as  they were prepared to accept at the guaranteed prices *  This would place the London wholesalers, whose trade was dependent on Scottish  supplies in a very inferior position as compared with their fellow traders, who were enjoying the freedom of uncontrolled markets in England,  Already Smithfield wholesalers have a legitimate grievance against the Ministry owing to the fact that they are  still subjeot to control while the South American importers are relatively free.  Further ground for dissatisfaction- tion in Smithfield might easily lead to a situation which would embarrass at once the Ministry and the consuming public very considerably*        In the case of Irish cattle there would appear to be no alternative to re-auctioning the cattle either at the port or at some Inland market.  The Ministry would have no staff or organ!&quot; sation to deal with the transfer of these cattle to inland markets * In  former days the Irish farmers sent thoir cattle from market to  market in order to get the best price*  The Ministry would have to engage dealers to undertake this duty, but would be handi- capped by having to employ men who had no direct Interest In securing  the best price for the beasts *  The loss which is already being made on many of the cattle whioh come from Ireland would undoubtedly be enhanced.        It should be borne in mind that the desire for maintained control emanates from those districts which will send forward the largest number of inferior cattle, so that although the quantity of  cattle passing through the hands of the Department will be considerably lessened by partial decontrol, the stocks of cattle in  respeot of which they anticipate a loss will not be materially lessened  in quantity, while the loss will certainly be more considerables  It is not therefore clear that any appreciable saving would be effected by the proposal under considerations        It has always been agreed that decontrol would cause a rise in  the price of the better meat and a fall in the price of inferior qualities *   This would involve a marked disparity In the price of the best meat In the industrial areas of England oompared with that In  the industrial areas of Scotland^  The Welsh miner, who insists on having the best meat, would naturally grumble at having to  pay more than the Clyde ship^v/orker, and this complaint would be  twisted Into an argument in favour of recontrol.        There may be differences of view as to the value to the State of  the bargain made with the farmers so far as cattle* prices are concerned, but as the bargain Is made I have always been clear that the best thing to do is to carry it out in Its entirety  unless it can be wholly rescinded,,MINISTRY OP FOOD.                  GEO. H. ROBERTS   7th February 1920.
