PARAPHRASE: mi-iaRAM from the Secretary of State for theColonies to the Governor General of New Zealand,     Sent 9o40 p.m. 3rd February, 1920.          Y/ith reference to your telegram 27th JanuarySamoa,   General Smuts has in connection with Mandate for south West Africa-strongly urged the.view that signature of Peace Treaty by the KingVs Dominion Ministers  andconferment of Mandates by League of Nations or great.Powerson Dominions marks new departure in constitutional  positionin Empire.   He objects to the proposed procedure by Orderin Council under Foreign Jurisdiction Act, maintaining that the King is concerned not in his British government but in his Dominion Government and that any Act purporting to confer jurisdiction over Mandated territories  like SouthWest Africa or Samoa should emanate from His Majesty inhis Dominion Government,          Accordingly I have reconsidered the whole question in consultation with Law Officers of Crown who have advised to following effect,  &quot;Ho formal Act or Instrument such asthe proposed Order in Council on part of His Majesty isnecessary to enable the Union of South Africa or  etherDominion concerned to make provision for execution  ofMandate but Parliament of Dominion concerned is competent to make such provision and derives its authority  from theTreaty and Mandate,   His Majesty1s assent is shownsufficiently (1) by execution of Treaty to which HisMajesty in his Dominion of Union of South Africa  or other dominion concerned is a party and (2) by the conferring  ofthe Mandate,   General Smuts is anxious for uniformity in procedure as regards Mandates to three Dominions  concerned and I agree that uniformity is desirable if possible but                                                    should
 should your Ministers  prefer  on  legal grounds  or  on grounds of conveniancb f or  example  in view  of  terms of Act  20 of 1919  already passed  or- on any. ether  grounds to prcosed by v/ay  of  Order in  council  already  agreed to I am prepared to  obtain as  quickly  as possible issua of Order*   I desire  to point  out that-this  question also affects  the question of validating  past action since beginning&apos;of military  occupation in territories mandated to Dominions.   If by  virtue  cf  Peace Treaty Parliament of Dominion concerned has  full po^er to legislate for  future government of mandated territory  it vjculd appear to have power to validate past  action in  that territory.  Do your Ministers concur in this view?   If  so and other Dominions concerned agree I will with a vie?/, to leaving -their Parliaments to.pass rnaoessir:&apos;/ -1 ogisiation,, raise question cf omitting from.Imperial Indemnity Bill clauses at present contained in it  validating past action in territoriesmandated to Dominions,
PARAPHRASE TELI;iGRl\M  from the Governor General ofthe  Commonwealth  of  Australia to the Secretaryof State  for the  Colonies.(Received Colonial Office 5.53 p.m. 3rd February,1920)                       **I M T- HT T* MI (V M M ^ UW. M MFollowing from Prime Minister begins:-     Secret.  Mandate. It is most unfortunate thatthere hes been such  IonA, delay in settling mandates.I can, of course, , quite understand that the opposition of Japan may be responsible, but as the principles ofthe mandate, particularly those to which Japan takeb&apos;exception, including cpen door-policy, Lmmi;r-Tation,no fortification  of  islands,  were all embodied in thetreaty and were considered most carefully, and trieobjections of Ji-cpan heard at great length before thetreaty was signed, points definitely settled by thetreaty cannot now be raised by Japan or any other ofthe signatories.          The Commonwealth Government is being most seriously embarrassed at the position created by thedelay in  settling the mandates.   In three weeks thenew Parliament is to meet,-and a complete statement on tho policy and form of government of the islandswill be expected.  If this is not available, theGovernment will be subjected to strong criticism whichcannot be answered unless all the facts are set out.In any case we cannot go on as we are, and simply musthave finality.  Every day the Japanese, are ousting ourtraders,  are intriguing with Germans for freight,trading,  mining,   land, and other rights.  In defiance                                              of
 of oar refusal  to  arrant  a  permit  the  Agents  of Japanese ships  now threaten  to  send a  ship with cargo from  Japan to Rahaul and  to lift  cargo for Sydney:  naturally  this cannot &quot;be allowed: nobody can say what will follow.  The resources  of New Guinea must be  developed,  a^d for  this  we must  found a civil  Government,  for we can do nothing until the mandates are formally ratified,  Our interests, which  are those of the Empire must be safeguarded. Soldiers are insistent on policy of settlement of returned men in islands but nothing can be done on  this  or  any ether matter.   The rreat bulk of the  trade of these very rich islands will go to Japan unless we act without delay.   She will secure trade, shipping, land,  and other rights,  and generally exercise such influence as will so strengthen her claim for the  rimbt of  her nationalsto  settle in the islands as will be  most difficult;,to  answer before the League of  Nations.   As Australiac^ot agree to this in anv circumstances the policyof the Empire is obvious,  the mandate  must be settledforthwith.                  FER3US0F.
PARAPHRASE TiiL&amp;iGrRAM FRO!r the Secretary, of State for theColonies to the Governor General of the-Commonwealth ofAustralia,      Sent 12.50 p.m,  7th February 1920           I  have been in communication by  telegraph with New Zealand  and Union of South Africa  as to manner in which provision should be made for the execution  of Mandates in  respect  of former  German territories  to be issued to the  Dominions.   New Zealand presumed that legislative  authority would be conferred on New Zealand Parliament and asked whether such authority would be conferred by Order in Council  under Foreign Jurisdiction Act or by Imperial Act*   His  Majesty&apos;s Government replied that  authority could be  conferred by Order in Council under Foreign Jurisdiction Act  and Hew Zealand accordingly prepared draft Order.  Following telegram  sent by me to the Governor General  of Hew Zealand 3rd February, shows present  position.   Begins   V/ith reference to your telegram 27th  January  Samoa,.   General Smuts has  in connection v/ith Mandate for South v/est Africa strongly urged  the  view that  signature  of Peace Treaty by the King&apos;sDominion Ministers and conferment of Mandates by League ofNations  or great Powers  on Dominions marks new departure in  constitutional position in Empire-   He objects to theproposed procedure by Order in Council under ForeignJurisdiction Act, maintaining that the King is concernednot in his British Government but in his dominion government and that any Act purporting to confer jurisdictiiover mandated territories lUae South V/est Africa or Samoashould emanate from His lajesty in his Dominion Government.                                                Accordingly
 Accordingly I  have reconsidered  the whole  question  in consultation with Law Officers  of Grown who have  advised to following effect,   .&apos;No  formal Act  or Instrument  such as the proposed Order in Council on part  of His Majesty is necessary to enable the Union of South Africa  or  other Dominion concerned to make provision for execution  of Mandate but Parliament of  Dominion concerned is competent to make such provision and derives its authority  from the Treaty and  Mandate.    His  Majesty&apos;s assent is  shown sufficiently (1)  by execution of Treaty to which  His Majesty in his Dominion  of Union of South Africa or other Dominion concerned is a party  and (2) by the conferring of the Mandate.  G-eneral  Smuts, is anxious for uniformity in procedure as regards Mandates to three Dominions concerned  and I. agree that uniformity  is desirable if possible hut should your Ministers prefer  on legal  grounds or on grounds of convenience for  example  in view of terms of Act 20 of 1919 already-dy passed   On or/any other grounds  to proceed by way of Order, in Council already agreed to  I am prepared to obtain as quickly as  &apos; possible issue of  Order.     I desire to point out that this question also affects the  question of, validating past action since beginning of military occupation in territories mandatedto Dominions  If by virtue  of Peace Treaty Parliament ofDominion concerned has full power to legislate for future government  of mandated territory it v;ould. appear to have powerto validate past action in that territory.   Do your Ministers concur in this view?  If so and other Dominions concerned agree I will with  a view., to leaving their Parliaments to pass                                                   necessary
