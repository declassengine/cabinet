Memorandum by the president of &quot;the Board  of Education.                  (See also .C *P*456 and C.?.489).      With reference to the Food Controller1Memorandumof the 14th January. Cabinet Paper No.456, I append a Draftof a Memorandum which has now been received from lord^Abemon, who Is abroad.  Since the revision and completionof the Draft would require reference to Lord D&apos;Abernon, and since,in its present form, it gives a sufficient Indication of his general views, I  have thought it better to circulate  it inthe precise form  in which it was received  in order to avoiddelay.                                   (Signed)  H.A.L,Flsher*.3rd, Pel) Vi 1920. ,                                          ......           tmmm mw ml iMnW * m mtMmmw^mmmmmm m**mtm INK to-1 m*Hmw) m4mm* mi m m0mH wmm* mm &quot;mm i^mpiMtxw mmm*mmm**Jmmmm1mwmmmmmmmmmwmmvm*m0m*m&amp;                        lord D*Abernon*B Draft.      The Pood Controller&apos;s  Memorandum appears  to assume thatthe result of previous  relaxations, in 1919 has  been  gatis-factory.  This is far from  the case. - Drunkenness has increased at an appalling rate,                         (Give figures).Any further aggravation of  the drinking danger  would  plungethe country back  into pre-war conditions,      The connectionof cause and  effect between relaxationsand increased drunkenness,  appears clear from the  following       ^comparisons and considerations,                          (Insert),If this review is correct,  the proposal.to increase  further the strength of beer appears highly dangerous.      The argument  that strong beer prevents  the use ofspirits is one of little  validity  and  of  dangerous  application.The same argument can be  applied  in favour of strong spiritsas against other  drugs, -  such  as  cocaine  *  or of cocaineas against varnish  or methylated- spirit.   It. has no  real substance and  is  regularly adduced to  obtairi an increase ofalcoholic strength  which is thought profitable.      The ground  that the present  restriction of averagegravity is hard on  the  Trade falls to  the ground if theresult of trading under Restriction since  the &quot;war is examined.
(Give general  results Balance-sheets  of Companies, Value of Premises. Income Tax returns.)     As regards the special firms which brew heavy &quot;beer,the same result is shorau          (Balance-sheet   Bass                &quot;          Guinness                &quot;          Worthington.)      The argument of the Irish comparison proves nothing but the folly of having increased Irish gravity to itspresent level.  This ?;as quite indefensible.  No argumentbas-ed on insufficient profits by Trade will stand anyexaminationp      On the contrary, it is clear that increased taxationis not only justified, but is necessary to preventexcessive indulgence.      An increase of taxation ought to have been imposedwhen quantities (both beer and spirits) were increased(and profits thereby very largely enhanced),
