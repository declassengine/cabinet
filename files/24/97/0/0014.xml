  This rwnmpmt is the Property of7T.s tfnta^wn MatasWs Government)       . QPAJ* BMSI;   CONFIDENTIALMemorandum by the President of the         Board of Trade.     To remove the feeling of uncertainty in the  Ooal  Industryand to allay the restlessness.of the miners, it  is  of  the utmost importance in my opinion that at the beginning of the  new session of Parliament the Government should             I,       Bring forward  a Bill to settle the profits                      of the Ooal Owners from the beginning of                      the last financial year to  the end 01                      August next.II.III.Announce its policy for the rest of theperiod during&quot;which conditions of the goal Industry will be abnormal - which may &apos;extend for, say, another two years.Give some indication of what its policy will be after the resumption of normalconditions, .     It is essential that special arrangements should be made for existing abnormal conditions.   Owing to the extreme shortageof coal in to ope and to the fact that this country ca:.i onlyexport much less than before the war, collieries allowed to exportmake very much larger profits than collieries compelled tosupply inland requirements.       I accordingly make the following proposals under the abovethree head ings:-       1.   I recommend that the attached draft Bill for dealingwith the present emergency be adopted.  The principle of theBill is simple.  It provides in brief                        (a) that the industry shall be guaranteed                        9/lOth of its pre-war standard, but that the                        guarantee shall not apply if and so long                        as there is a strike,                        (b) that, if the  earnings of the industry                        permit of it* the pre-war standard of each                        undertaking shall be made up and one tenth                        of the net aggregate earnings left over                        shall be shared  out among the Coal owners in                        proportion to ,output.it   fcc4 rtiiv
   These provisions would  take  the place of the Goal MinesControl Agreement and apply up  to the -approximate date atwhich the Goal Mines Control Agreement would automaticallylapse.     For the period    April 1st, 1919, to March 31st 1920the profits of the industry are estimated to exceed theaggregate of the previous  standards, and in the period from april 1920  to August 1920  the profits will he still greater.Consequently no loss need  be apprehended&apos; as a result of theguarantee - on the other hand,  for this financial year it isestimated that the maximum orofits which the owners can receiveunder the new arrangements-are  little more  than they wouldhave obtain ined under the l/2 Bill.         11.  The coal position cannot possibly become normalby the end  of August this  year, nor  for very many monthsafter that  date.   It will be necessary, therefore, tocontinue some form of control after  that date and to make special arrangements with  regard  to  export and home prices.This being  the case and in all  the circumstances am strongly of opinion that the most expedient coursewould be to establish at once a Ministry of Mines and setup in connection with it a Council of the Industry with adequate Labour representation.   For the duration of thsreconstruv; oion period, the Ministry  would have&apos; to be givenpowers both to regulate export  and,  as a cci-ollary, to safe-guard the home consumer1^  interests  and perhaps also theinterests of collieries  prejudiced  by-the  *regulation,.     But a... the Ministry could hardly be in working order much before the end  of August  details could he leftto be worked out  by a Committee appointed ad hoc,
w 55 M      It would not  &quot;be satisfactory to  continue  for the rest  of the  re-construction period the Emergency arrangement proposed  above for  the period ending in August of this year. It happens to  be adequate for the  emergency purpose because the period to  which  it relates has already lapsed to -a large extent, but  it does  not give adequate incentive to each under- taking-  to get  the best results, nor does it remove the uncer-. tain:fcy  which  continues to impede development - and this is, perhaps, the most serious aspect.     III.   As I have already stated,  it is in my opinion essential that some indication should be given now ofwhat the Government^s policy is to be  ajjart from abnormal conditions.     In the first place there  is the Nationalisation of Royalties,   In the preparation of a scheme, a number of highly complicated and technical questions will arise,  and itwould therefore&quot;  be unwise to  proceed hurrielly.   It should be one of the first duties of the suggested Ministry of Mines toprepare a scheme.   In connection with this there is also the question of the social amelioration fund to settle in detail,  .     Eor the rest, there are five possible courses.-                  (a)   Unrestricted Competition - there                   being no Government supervision or regti-                   lation of any kind beyond what existed                   before the war                  (I)   A Ministry of Mines with limited                   powers (somewhat on the lines of the                   Ministry of Transport) and in associa-                   tion with it a council of the industry.                  (c)   Enforced district amalgamation con-                   trolled by a Government Department,   This .                   is Sir Arthur DuckhamTs proposal in his                   minority report as a member of the Sanliey                   Commission.                  (d)   The creation of District Public Trusts
                      - 4 **                                     62                        to  work the mines  on the model of the                        Port  of London Authority,   This would                        involve the buying out of the existing                        owners (a very large financial operation)                        and complete re-organisation of the                        industry,                       fe)    Thorough-going Nationalisation with a                        Government Department as the ultimate                        authority.   This would equally involve                        buying out the Coal owners and completely                        re-organising the industry,     I feel no doubt that the wisest course to take in all thecircumstances, is the second,- in the first instance at any rate--and a start could be made with very limited powers.   3?romevidence offered on various  occasions by the more enlightenedcolliery owners, and in view of recommendations made by variousofficial committees (see appendix attached) it is reasonable to conclude that it would rally all moderate men.   It would havethe additional merit of offering enough to the Miners to preventtheir agitation becoming a public danger, especially if supple- mented by a provision for giving the Miners some further insightinto the figures of cost and production and some participation in the  profits.   Provision must also be made  for safeguarding the interest of the consumer.   In itself o-that is to say,apart from,any existing agitation - there is much to be  said forsome State responsibility,as Coal lies at the  root of our economic prosperity and questions connected with monopoly, undue  prices,preference, conservation  transport and utilisation of resources,as well as those connected with Traces and the  amenities  of life in coal districts,  are  bound to arise from time to time.     I  therefore propose that the Ministry of  Kines should beestablished as a regular part of the  Government machinery,  and
M 5 -I not merely with reference to the problem of the Re-construction  period.   It should be indicated in the announcement that only  limited powers were contemplated for the post-reconstruction&apos;%  period.   The Ministry if decided upon,  should be  created at  once for the  reconstruction work and to  work out in detail its  post-reconstruction functions.       To summarise.  I recommend  as follows       1*     The  adoption and immediate  introduction of  the                attached Bill.        .     A Committee to  prepare a working scheme for the                rest  of the Reconstruction period to  be under                control of the new Ministry  when formed.       3*     The  announcement at the same time that  a permanent                Ministry of Mines (with a  Council of  the  industry                in association with it) would  be set  up at  once                (a) to prepare and bring  forward schemes  for                regulation during the reconstruction  period, the                Nationalisation of Royalties and the  administra-                tion  of  the social amelioration fund  and  (b) to                make  proposals with regard to  the limited                supervisory and any other  functions of the                Ministry after the Reconstruction period,          2T^. \j(tnvicwu  IfXO
         The establishment.of a Ministry of  Mines  or  a Mining Department has been recommended by  all  the  Committees on  those phases of post-war  reconstruction that  are  relevant  to the question.         The report  of  the CONTROLLED OF  THE MINERAL RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT under  the Ministry of Munitions (Sir Lionel Phillips)  makes a definite and emphatic recommendation in  favour  of the  establishment  of a &quot;Mines Department&quot; (paras. 287-332).     After remarking  &quot;the absence of a properly organised Mines  Department  in the United  Kingdom is most detrimental to the  industry&quot;  the Report instances  the loss of mineral resources owing  to mines  being unnecessarily abandoned, as one of the chief  reasons  for the  need of such a Department, and adds,                &quot;  Its establishment would be hailed with enthusiasm       by  those-directly interested in the industry, and the co-       operation of  mine owners and managers could be relied       upon.    The  establishment of such a Department armed with       legal powers  is recommended.    Very many examples might&apos; be       given of the  difficulties which persons controlling mining       operations in Great Britain are experiencing to-day, and       innumerable  enquiries on a variety of subjects have been       received, most  of which would have been overcome  or       answered by a fully equipped Mines Department&quot;,        The Mining Sub-Committee of the COAL&apos; CONSERVATION COMMITTEEof the Ministry of Reconstruction recommended the establishmentof a separate Ministry of Mines and Minerals (paras. 7 &amp; 8).&quot;It is now proposed&quot;,  they say, &quot;that (subject to certain excep- ,tions) all  the functions vested in various Government Depart-ments before the war in the matter of the coal mining industry...be transferred to and administered by a separate Ministry of mines and Minerals,  presided over by a Minister with a seat inParliament.&quot;RECOMMENDATIONS B3GABDING A MINISTRY  OF  MINES.
      The   ACQUISITION AND VALUATION OF LAND COMMITTEE of the Ministry  of Reconstruction recommended (para.7) a Government Mining.  Department, having initiative, advisory and executive powers, but were opposed (para.8) to the creation of a separate Ministry  of Mines.      The  OOAL INDUSTHY COMMISSION.   Mr. JUSTICE SANKEY, in  - recommending the nationalisation of mines, recommended also the creation of a Ministry of Mines as a necessary consequence and made  certain detailed proposals as to its functions.   The Report  of Mr,Balfour and his colleagues also recommended (Section  43) that a Mines Department should be set up having jurisdiction over all questions relating to Coal Mines,  except the adjustment of labour disputes and wages.   Sir ARTHUR DUCKEAM (paraft26) recommended that &quot;A Ministry of Mines should be set up, and, at a later date, form one of a group ofMinistries * attached to a Ministry of Industry&quot;               Functions of a Ministry,of Mineft. 1-     Co-ordination of existing Government activities.     All  Committees that dealt with the subject were impressed by the desirability of co-ordination of such activities as the foilowing:- (a)      Inspection and safety.     (Borne Office)., (b)      Geological survey.       -  (Board of Education). (c)      Statistics.                (Board of Trade). (d) Mining development and statistics throughout the Empire.                                    (Colonial Office &amp; Imperial                                         Institute).
