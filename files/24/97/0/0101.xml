(THIS TOUMT IS THE PROPERTY OP, HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT) *    CONFIDENTIAL.;    C.P.-598.       C\        CABINET.                 GEIMINJLTTITUPE  IK  REGARD  TO  HANDING  OVER              &apos;   SFPERSOflS&apos; AOOtlSlg  Off ffgMCHflTOff  THE                               LAWS  Off WAR.            Copy  of letter  from Colonel W.  Stewart  Roddie  to                      Sir Almerio  Eitzroy,(Circulated for information, at the request              of Mr.  Balfour).                             Inter-Allied Commission of Control,                                        BERLIN.                                   30th January, 19 0.Dear Sir Aimerie,        I am again going to unload on you part of the weight whichthis consumptive country has laid on my mind.  During the weekswhich have passed since I last wrote to you one has heen able tofollow the downward progress as one foresaw it and I can honestlysay that the deterioration in many ways is about commensurate withthe depreciation of the mark which, as you know, stands at bfo ofits nominal value.        At the risk of boring you with repetition I must again touchon the subject of the trial of the officers.   This is more serious than ever because action of some kind is now imminent.  I pray you tobelieve that the thin^ is impossible.  I did not go so far as sayingthat In my last letter, in fact I told some of the Ministers while was in London that a caroful preparation of the mind of the Germanpeople by some sort of propaganda might make the proposal a feasibleone, but that preparation is not possible and the German remainj asfirmly convinced&apos;, as ever of the &quot;gross injustice of a trial in whichthe judge is the accuser&quot;.   British prestige has suffered immeasurablyhere on this account.   This may be compensated for by some mysteriousadvantage whioh we gain at home, but if this advantage is not acolossal one then the  action,  judging by its effects here, isutterly unjustifiable.
     Three  days ago I had another meating with the Germans,I particularly refrain^ from meeting them sooner as I wishedto live in  the country for a few weeks first and form my own opinion of  the feeling of the people.  One week I spent inSaxony and  my range of personal enquiry extended far beyondthe borders of Prussia.     On Wednesday I met them.  The same representatives asat the former meeting, minus the Hamburg financier, butaugmented by Gessfer the Minister    for Reconstruction Albert,the Reichskanzclei Secretaire, (a post corresponding to thatof our Clerk to the Privy Council) and an officer of theHeiohswehr  (National Army) whose name I did not learn.     I shall repeat to you such parta of the conversationas, I feel  to be true, sound and of grave import.NOSES.  &quot;Whan you came to us before, we told you of the utterimpossibility of carrying out the conditions imposed withregard to the handing over of the officers.  We honestly thankyou for having taken our message to your Ministers.  It ispossible that on that account the list has boen modified, but what your people must understand is that our whole difficulty is not that of the individual ooncerned but that of the principle involved.   I said to the best of our ability, we would carryout all the conditions but this is a psychological as well as aphysical impossibility, and therefore beyond our ability.     I know how far I oan go with this people and this is myboundary.   Beyond this I shall not ^o.  You ask mo shall I take up a neutral attitude ?  No.  The people look on me as a strongman and they need a strong man.  Would they still believe in mystrength if I were to say neither &quot;yea&quot; nor &quot;nay&quot; at auoh^a time.Were the former to be my line, what would happen ?  5?he Reiohswehrwhioh is composed of all elements would divide against itself the same with the Police.  Then you would have the Spartloist                         .-I ------- ill1  , - .                                                      element
 element   which by the way,  would gladly deliver up these officers - and me with them - this element would have its long looked for chance and you have the new revolution at once.  The country covered with bloodshed again,  and how wi^l you benefit ? then again if I say nUott, which I shall dg[;, - I shall be able to maintain order just until the Entente again begin to apply pressure,, then the result will be the  same but I, thank God, shall at least feel that the responsibility for the finishing touch-of dewtruction has not been mine.  The country&apos; is in the balance and this will upset  it utterly.  It is impossible to reach the people by newspaper propaganda.  Only the . aartacistpress would print the explanation and  the other side would retaliate with a counter blast.  Then  a newspaper war.  The seople upset and excited, and in their present abnormal condition who can answer fer the consequences.  Are  your people being deceived by the superficial appearance of normality  in the country.if so, you are being deceived by the hectic flush that gives an appearance of health to a patient dying of galloping consumption- tion.  Our days are numbered - unless  you realise our Condition - and when the chaos arrives in this.land - and^ho knows  where else ?-  God help the man who has On his conscience the respecting&apos;on* sibility and guilt of having put the telescope to his blind eye.If the Entente policy is our utter destruction, good, JLt is successful,  but if it ia, a* surely for their own sake it must be, conatructive, then this treatment ia absolutely ruinous to their own interests.     I can&apos;t tell you what good it has done me to hear you say that your Minister for War told you that he recognised in me abarrier between Bolshevism and tfc? old military and monarchialregime but tell him I can be no barrier without his and his country*s help.  Tell him he doesn*t know what it is to struggle.not only for, but with a dying country.  Look at ours,,,
a country with confidence in neither God nor Government.   How canthey have confidence in us?   Every day sinking lower into theslime.   What are we able to do for them?  Don&apos;t you see what itwould mean if your country now sai(ff &quot;We believe now that thismatter can be dealt with in&apos; Germany&quot;.   The people would feelthat we were strong enough to do something for them and what a reaction in favour of England there would be. ;  (This  is  absolutelythe  fact  (Intd.)  W.  S.  R.)     A little confidence awakened, a little will born of confidence,a little work born of will and then, with a little coal and creditwho knows but even yet we may turn the corner.     . &quot;Look&quot; he said to me, &quot;If it fern a strong man it is  because i have no cause to be weak.   My only son was shot to oits -Oh no.   He&apos;washed killed - he is in a madhouse - &quot;so endet dieFamilie rloske&quot; - jNoske said this without changing a tone butstaring in front of him instead of looking at me) - &quot; and s.o1 ionTt need to save any of my strength, but this thing whichI am asked to do is beyond me - beyond my Government, I can&apos;t goon ruling, with a machine gun.  You and your people only can endthis&quot;.     I cannot reproduce Noekefs  plain, almost brutal eloquencenor can I transmit his conviction, but I can, and do tell you that every word he said is true.   And I will tell you one more thing.   You will never get a single Officer out of Germanyexcept such as might take it into his &quot;head to give himself up,and even after that if you tried him in England it would breakup things here for the people would rise up against a government who were too weak to prevent this.     If I were asked what -could be done I should say &quot;Get outof it as best you can&quot; - I can1t say how, but if there is a waytake it&quot;.   This Government must be retained and supported notonly morally supported but practically.                             - 4 -
    There were other natters I wanted to write to  you ah out;the appalling economic situation and the unchecked progress  ofRussian Bolshevism.  Poland is going to be no barrier and unlessthe situation here changes very soon, the Russian  Bolshevists  will find a welcome and a warm fireside in Germany.  The sooner thatGermany and England are in a position to put their heads togetherabout this matter the better.   Is there any other  way of solving the Bolshevist riddle?  Remember this.  Germany is- not crying&quot;Wolf&quot;.  Can we afford to let  Germany and Russia,  and Austria  bein this condition.  It!s- a big slice of the world  - even to  be out of trading connection with - and it is. a big slice of theworld to be overrun by evil.  ;    Some day soon I shall write you r jout the economic conditions.Attention to these is Just about as .murgent as to  what I have written of here.    I would like to tell you one instance a propos Noske&apos;sremark on the deceptiveness of appearance.    On the 13th of January last, I had to work my  way throughcrowds of thousands of Germans marching to the Reichstag- to  protest against certain labour laws,, I, as everyone else,  was at ruck by  theextreme apathy and lassitude of the crowd.  They looked as if  therewere not a kick left in them.   Two hours later I went to theReichstag and saw a howling mad mob wht, had they  succeeded in getting into the building would have torn the members asunder  -without making any party distinction.  Half an hour later therewere fifty-two bodies in the square and over a hundred woundedlying on the paving stones.    And somewhere I read afterwards in the English press that  &quot;thefiring was unnecessary&quot; that &quot;the people werequiet and orderly1.!&quot;Members of the Sicherheite Pclizie were thrown in  the river and kept down - prodded with poles until they drowned, by a Jaer:..$hooting crowd, the same crowd that a few hours before slouchedalong the streets scarcely able to lift their f ect j$      theirheads up.
                                                            .-I p- i\i2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.      10th February, 1920.- 6 adamn country?  Let it rot, simplest way *ut&quot;. ,      I don&apos;t worry about the country, I worry about the &quot;tot&quot;.                           Yours sincerely,                              (Signed) W.
