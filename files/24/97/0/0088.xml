    We are bound by law  to secure the release from the Army of allconscripts by the 30fch April at the latest.  The dangers and responsibilities of the immediate future are  such that we must  continue  to enlist everyman who volunteers up to  that date.   Then, at any rate, we shall havedone our best.  If our resources are not equal to our needs, we can at leastsay, &quot; We have taken every volunteer we could get.&quot;    This fixes the total number of effective white soldiers in the Army onthe 30th April at approximately 220,000 white troops, all ranks (excludingthose  paid  for  by India   and  those  on  demobilization furlough,  grave-diggers, &amp;c).  This compares with 173,000 before the war.   The balance 47,000 represents provision  against  temporary and new  responsibilities.In addition, we shall have  on our  charge 135,000 native troops as against9,000  pre-war.   It will be quite  easy,  if the dangers diminish  or  policyrelieves us of responsibilities,  to reduce these numbers after the 30th April.    It seems to me, however, quite as likely that  increasing disturbances in the East will require the maintenance of recruiting throughout the yearto the utmost limits of the  voluntary system.   This matter need  not bedecided now, and  I have,  therefore,  taken the figure which the volunteerarmy  will  reach  on  the  30th  April  as the  average  bearing   figurethroughout  the  year.  Men  can only be  obtained at a  certain rate,  butthey can, of course, be easily got rid of if circumstances take a favourableturn.    (E20/8D)  100 H&amp;S  2/20 7&apos;J34wo.
    1  have had the  Army Estimates for  this year prepared under three separate headings:     (a.)  The  normal peace-time army, for which, according to  the wishes           of the Cabinet, a  maximum has  been assigned of 62 millions,           i.e.,   75  millions  for  the  Army  and  Air  Force  together           (excluding  India),  minus  13  millions  for   the  Air  Force.           Estimated cash expenditure in ] 920/21, 55^-millions.    (6.)  Terminal expenses  of the war, 30^- millions.   These  consist  of           expenditure which has  already been incurred or to which we           are already  committed,  aud which will  have  to  be met  in           1920-21.    (c.)  Expenditure of an abnormal or a quasi-war character arising out           of temporary  obligations,  e,g., the  Rhine,  Constantinople,  or           new responsibilities such  as  Palestine, Mesopotamia,  Persia.           Total, 48 millions.     The total of (a), (b) and (c) amounts to 134 millions, but against this must be set 82 millions repayable  by Germany and by the Dominions  inrespect of charges which  have been or will be included in Army Accounts,so  that  the  net total   of  ray  claim.on  the  Exchequer is 52 millions.as  shown  in  the &quot;Summary of  Army  Estimates, 1920/21,&quot;  circulated with this.     With regard to (a), the total expenditure reaches 5 5-g- millions out of the62 millions  allotted.   As the stocks of clothing and stores on which we are living are year by year depleted, the expenditure will rise to the normal of62 millions.    This  sum  is,  as regards the  main items  of maintenance,roughly  2^ times the cost of the pre-war army and is intended to  provide in  principle a reproduction  of the pre-war  army, making  allowance forthe fall in the purchasing power of money. For this sum it might be possible
to provide 173,000 white troops (exclusive of the garrison of India paid forby India) and about 9,000 native troops, i.e., what we had on charge beforethe war.   It will be for the Cabinet to decide when the state of  the world and of the British Empire will enable our vital needs to be discharged witha force of these dimensions.  They certainly cannot be so met this year.    At the present time  the interior economy of the army is deranged bythe aftermath of the war and the  process of reconstitution.   There isno doubt a considerable margin within which it will be possible to obtain.better value for  the money spent upon the normal army; but this is  a process of  refinement  requiring  the  care  and thrift of  several years.It  will probably be several years before we reach anything like the high standard  of interior economy  which existed  in pre-war days.   In anycase the changes which are possible in  this field are of a minor character,and will not  sensibly affect the main problem  which is before  the Cabinet.Our  first  task has  been  to  recreate a  voluntary army, and it  is  only after it has been called into being that the achievement of a high economy,i,e., more  fighting  power for  the same  expense  or  the  same  fightingpower for less expense, can be looked  for.    With regard to (o), there is very little room for argument.   The moneylias been spent and the bill must be paid.  The  principal items are charges for  transport  already  provided by  sea and  land,  which  are  only nowmaturing, 13 millions; moribund war-time  separation allowance, 5 millions ;payments still to be made to the Ministry of  Munitions  on war account;care  and  maintenance of a number  of  war  wounded still on  our hands;reinstatement of property taken  during  the   war; medals,  records, war graves, &amp;c,...........
     As to (c), this provides the only possible field for immediate substantial reduction, and the Cabinet must decide on the policy.     (i.)  The  cost of the Rhine garrison,  20,000  all  ranks,  includingplebiscitary troops, is estimated at 5 millions.  This  should  be recovered from Germany and debited against Appropriations-in-Aid.     (ii.) Keeping 9,500  white and 15,500 native  troops  at and aroundConstantinople will cost  6A-  millions per  annum.   This expense can be terminated and the total reduced by a decision of policy.     (iii.) Keeping 6,000 white and 23,000 native  troops in  Egypt  overand above the pre-war garrison  of 6,000  white troops will be approxi-mately 7 millions a year.  This excess  is  due to  the unrest  in Egypt.Lord Allenby will strongly resist any  diminution of his present  forces, but1 suggest that the Cabinet should instruct Lord Milner, who is on the spot,to go  into the  whole question with  him,  and  ascertain  whether  any reduction in the reinforced Egyptian garrison can be made, and  when.     There remain the new possessions, Palestine and Mesopotamia.     (iv.)  Palestine. The cost of maintaining 9,000 British and 26,000 nativetroops  in  Palestine during the year  will be about 7f  millions, exclusive of  ll&quot;  millions for  land  and  hutting.    This is,  of course, far beyondanything which Palestine can ever yield in return.   On the other hand,Lord Allenby and the General Staff are  in  agreement that danger will result  from any diminution.   Again I suggest that  Lord  Milner shouldbe directed by  the Cabinet  to review  the  whole  question  with  lord allenby  on the  spot  and  report l?y telegraph.
    (v.) Mesopotamia. The cost of the military establishment in Meso-potamia appears to me to be out of all proportion to  any advantage we  oanever  expect  to reap  from that  country.   The expense of  maintaining14,000 white and 50,000 native troops in that sparsely populated province of the late Turkish Empire cannot, with the rupee at  2s. 6d., be less than16 millions  a  year, and  in 1920/21  it is estimated  at  18^  millions.If the  garrison  is  to  be  fixed  on  that  scale,   barrack  accommoda-tion  and  institutions  of all kinds  necessary  for the health  and welfare of the army  must  be taken  in  hand, involving very large  new  capitaloutlay not  included  in   the  above  figure.   There  is no part of  theworld in  which  the individual  white soldier  will  cost  more  to  keep.When   we  think  of  the relative  importance to  the  nation  of  a territorial Army of a peace strength of 250,000, costing about 8 millions,and the  maintenance of  a Mesopotamian garrison of this scale costingI9j millions,  it seems high time  that our  general policy in  regard to mesopotamia should  be fundamentally  reconsidered.    Apart from   its importance as a link in the aerial route to India and the  air defence of  theMiddle East, and apart from  the military significance of  the  oil deposits,the General  Staff  are  not pressing for the  retention of  Mesopotamia.or any  part of  it,  on  strategic grounds  of  Imperial  security.    Ourpresence  there  is  entirely a  matter  of State  policy,  in  which  thedecision  does not rest with  the  military authorities.   On the other hand, ifwe are to remain there the safety and health of the  troops stationed  there,and their  adequacy for the task assigned to  them, are matters in whichthe Commander on the spot and the  military authorities at home are boundto express  an opinion.  Personally, I believe  that  the military forces inMesopotamia are out of all proportion to what it is justifiable or reasonable to employ in  that part of the world.  I have, therefore, asked the General staff to report  what portions  of Mesopotamia they  oould still  hold,  without
endangering the troops, with a force not exceeding 4,000 white and  16,00flnative soldiers,  For  this purpose  I have authorized  them to consider theabandonment  of Mosul and  Hamadan  and the retention  simply of agarrison  in a  fortified area at Baghdad, a garrison at Basra and  certainsmall detachments in blockhouses at various points with armed steamers onthe river. The cost of such a reduced force, apart from capital expenditure,would be approximately 5$-  millions  a  year.  Because  we  have  had a country like this assigned  to us, it does not follow that we should  occupy the whole of it at once.  It should be  quite sufficient to hold  Baghdad andthe river line and let our influence  gradually radiate out from there in thenext  10  or ] 5 years as was done from Khartoum in  the Soudan.    I  amentirely opposed to maintaining an army of the  dimensions  now demandedin Mesopotamia, and if  there is no  other method of holding the country, Iam of opinion  that our commitments should be reduced. -    I must further point out  that  the Bolshevik  and Turkish Nationalistmenace,  together with  the  Arab disturbances consequent  on the   Frenchseizure of Syria, will expose all troops in  Mesopotamia to continued and increasing danger.    (vi.) Persia. The  cost  of maintaining the  1,200 white and  10,000Indian troops in North-West Persia will be about 2f millions.  In  additionto  this  I have  received  a  notification  from  the  India  Office that approximately 9 millions will be required for the maintenance of  indian troops on Imperial service in East and  South Persia, principally at Meshed.This figure appears to be far in excess of anything justified  by  the small number of troops involved, but in any case I must  protest in the strongestmanner against the War Office being  made responsible  for these charges&apos;,and I have not included them in my Estimates.  Fancy spending the whole cost of a British  Territorial Army on  a  weak and  futile  interference in
the affairs of Persia !   In view of the  accumulation of Bolshevik forces inTrans-Caspia and  their control of the Caspian in the near future, there areno means of preventing Persia from being over-run from without and raised in insurrection from within.  The forces  which it is proposed by the ForeignOffice and the India Office to maintain there at this enormous cost will  betotally insufficient to resist any serious attack and will have to withdrawwith the utmost celerity under the first  serious pressure.  I do not considerthat the military resources of the British Empire on the voluntary systemenable us to offer effective resistance to a Bolshevik advance short of -themain frontiers of India.  The  Government should not, therefore,  enter intoobligations  with the  Persian Government,  or  excite hopes among  thePersian people of protection  which it is physically beyond their power toextend should real danger arise.     The  total of (i) (vi), viz., 52  millions,  is 4 millions in excess of the48 millions shown under (c) on page  2 of  this Note.    This  4 millionsrepresents the  extent to  which  it has  been possible  to provide thesegarrisons  out of the pre-war Army.     The whole question of the  financial relations between the War Officeand the  Government of India requires to  be reviewed.  Under existing arrangements  India  is only paying us  860,000 a jear as her share of thehome expenses of maintaining the White Army in India.  This figure, whichis based on pre-war prices, bears no relation to the present cost, and I am,therefore, allowing  in my  Estimates  provisionally  for  a contribution  of 2,150,000   in anticipation  of a  revision  of the  present arrangements.Further,  the exchange has moved so much to the advantage of India thatthe  additional cost  in these  estimates, represented by the fall in exchangealone as compared with the pre-war, amounts to 13 millions in  respect of
native troops which  she supplies to Us.  It will be  seen, therefore, that even if India paid the full cost of the services she is receivings we should stillbe heavy losers through the exchange.                    .    Although the cost  of the Army, normal, terminal and abnormal, is so high, I regret that its  righting powers  at  the present time are singularlylow.  The  remarkable  fact  is  that  an army  capable of garrisoning .theEmpire should have been created on the voluntary system within  the spaceof a  single year.  No  other country  in the  world  has attempted sucha  thing.  But  that Army is composed of  young boys and raw recruits,sprinkled   with  war-worn   men  and   encumbered  by   an  exceptionalproportion   of  administrative  personnel engaged  in  winding  up thewar  establishments  and training  and creating the new peace  units,The battalions  and  batteries of  the new  Army have  certainly not yet reached the  standard at which they could be  safely committed to any seriousmilitary enterprise  or have  any great  responsibility  thrown  upon  tfeem,either at home or abroad.  But they already show much promise, and everymonth will bring an improvement.  In two years a good professional fighting jforce will once again have come  into existence, and during that period theeffecting  of  those minor economies to which I have already referred must jbe sedulously pursued.   This  is, in fact, the year  when the expense of the]peace time British Army will be at its highest and the  results at their verylowest.                                 -   WINSTON  S. CHURCHILL.  THE WAR OFFICE,         7 th February,  1920.
