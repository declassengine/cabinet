The Admiralty have had under consideration the series of telegrams from and ,t,* the High Commasaifner.Const arrtaple* the Commander-ln-chief Mediterranean^: the -GwaaralOfficer Commanding Army of Black Sea ;and the High Commissioner,Stuth Russia, and they wish to bring to the notice of theCabinet their view on the most, pressihg,and important questionof the evacuation of refugees from South Russia, and the returnto Russia of certain Russian prisoners of War from.Germany.             The situation at the Moment Is as follows * -             A. prisoners of War from Germany.                On passage to South Russia&apos; In S.S* Constantlne, and                S.S. Christian, Neben &apos;         ,                S.S. Constantino has been given permission to                land her&apos; passengers at Novoroestsk.&quot;   .                S..B. Christian Nebe now. at Malta/ destination *f                passengers not settled as Dene kin ob J.e c t s to their               .:landing^South Russia.  .            &apos; B. Refugees from South Russia.                Consisting of Invalids, women and children belong-                ing.. to Denekin1 s;forces..... .       V,\    -                These were. guaranteed to&apos;be evacuated in case                of need by MruMackinder on account of the danger                of their falling Into Bolshevik-hands.3&apos;.           As regards A the S-.S. Christian Nebe is reported tobe overcrowded  and typhus threatened.             The Admiralty consider that it is imperative to take immediate action and therefore propose  that Denekin&apos;s objectionbe overruled and the passengers  landed  at Odessa as there is noother place where they can be received             It is pointed out that Denekin1s principle objectionto receiving these passengers is that they have pronouncedBolshevik tendencies-.             Though Odessa should be held and there is  a strongelement., principally Germans, who are prepared to defend thetown, the Russians command is vacillating and shows everyindication of abandoning the town to the Bolsheviks.             These Russian prisoners should be landed and make their own; choice.4v&quot; With regard to be.             The Admiralty view  with great  concern the  grave andfarreaching  commitment of  His, Ma-jesty^s Government  by Mr.Mackinder.             The numbers to be evacuated in the event of furtherwithdrawal of Denekin1s army will be very large and may run  intohundreds of  thousands.              Investigation have  already shown the, impracticabilityof acoomtedating even the comparatively, small number of  50,000quoted: recently in the telegrams under  considerationsGreece
             Greece will only receive her own nationals,  Serbiaand Bulgaria can only take a limited number;  Roumania ha3 given a grudging consent involving a quid pro quo;  Malta is embarrassedat this moment by the presence of the hospital ship Panama withtyphus&quot;Stricken refugees an i is unable to feed even these, oraccoiodate them ashore.             Egypt in Its present state of unrest appears to be amost unsuitable place for these refugees wha it should be.observed in parenthesis are Invariably the focus of political disturbances.             Constantinople can only acaimodate a very small number.             On the above facts the Board of Admiralty have arrivedat the conclusion with regret that the reponsibilitles involvedin MryMackinder1 s guarantees are too heavy., to be met In theirentirely.             Half measures have invariably proved to do more harm than good and in view of the Bolshevik proclamation by wirelessthat the death penalty has been abolished in those districtsunder their control and also that there are indications fromreliable sources of a more moderate policy of the SovietGovernment the Board consider that the time has come to reconsider&apos;whether,in view of the facts abo^e seatedfany attempt asregards evacuation Is justified.5.           With regard to the German prisoners awaitingrepatriation from Germany to South Russia for which&apos;certainships are under charter the Board consider they should be diverted to Central Kussia via Poland and Baltic States.             Ice conditions will limit the use of the Balticports for some time.(Intlld)    B.              28.1.20.Forwarded (Intlldc) W.H.L,      28 o1 * 2 0 *
