WHEAT PRODUCTION  IN  THE  UNITED  KINGDOM.              Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.     I DESIRE  to invite the earnest attention of my colleagues to  the increasing- anxieties with regard  both to finance  and supply, with which we are confronted as a result of our  failure to encourage the maximum production  of  foodstuffs especially wheat here within the United Kingdom.     It was  the cry of the &quot; cheap loaf&quot; which almost  killed  wheat-growing in these islands, and which (as the result of our reliance, since the &apos;80&apos;s, upon overseas supplies which seemed  both cheap and safe) threw 4,000,000 acres out  of arable cultivation and brought ruin to the industry.     This policy nearly wrecked us in war-time and now, in  peace, is proving almost as injurious.  The imported  &quot;cheap loaf&quot; has  become far more costly than the  home- grown article and even the supply is  now becoming precarious.  Most of the exporting countries have a  rapidly dwindling surplus ;  some, like Roumania, have almost ceased to produce ; others, like Russia, can no longer safely be depended upon.  In any event the cost of imported wheat is becoming  prohibitive.   At the present rates of exchange, American wheat landed here costs  137/- a quarter; Canadian, 125/-;  and Argentine, 110/-.  These adverse rates of exchange alone add nearly 2d. to the present subsidy on every quartern loaf.  Apart from  the, Australian supply, which I  understand is likely to s irink greatly in future, home-grown wheat is by far  the cheapest, owing to the fact that the controlled maximum price is only 76/-.  On the  other hand, the average cost of production is not less than 70/-, and is steadily increasing  with  the rise  in the labourers&apos; wages.   The possible margin of profit to the home-grower is thus approaching the vanishing  point, and not only is there no inducement to the farmer  to grow  wheat, but the  Government  policy is acting as  a direct and  effective deterrent to the growing of wheat at all,  How effective it is may be gathered from the fact that the acreage of  home-grown wheat has  already  fallen off by some 400,000 acres from the figures of  1918 and, under existing  conditions, this decline  is bound to continue.    The maintenance of this control  is  sometimes  defended on the ground that the. farmer is &quot; subsidised &quot;  by the Corn Production Act.  The. fact, of  course, is that the present &quot; guaranteed minimum &quot; price (45/-) is some  25/- below the cost of production and some 60/-  below the world market price.   It  has never  cost the taxpayer a penny piece, and the  only &quot; benefits &quot; which the farmer has so far  derived from it are  (as he sees and describes them) the loss of a free market (which costs him over  la quarter), and the Agricultural Wages Board, which  has nearly doubled  his  labour bill !    It is useless  to hope that, under  these conditions, there can be  any substantial increase in the farmers contribution to the  bread supply.  On the  contrary, it is certain that  it must  decrease, and more and more arable  land revert  to grass, unless the Government intervenes to arrest  the process and gives adequate encouragement to the wheat-grower.    This can  be  done  in  two ways.  First,  by statutory  and permanent  guaranteed minimum prices,  based upon and varying with the cost of production, as recommended by the Royal Commission,  and, secondly,  by the immediate promise  of  a free market for the crop  of 1920 aud succeeding years up to  a maximum price of, say,  100/- a quarter.  Nothing less  would be effective, and even at that price home-grown wheat would  be the cheapest obtainable.    It is a curious political phenomenon that, whilst there is  no  vestige of an  outcryagainst paying the foreigner from 30/- to  3 a quarter more than  is paid for &quot;the samearticle to the British farmer, the latter is denounced as a &quot; profiteer&quot; or &quot;bloodsucker&quot;if he  asks a fair  and sufficient margin of profit to enable him to grow wheat at all.To defer to this prejudice is not merely to cut off the  consumer from his  cheapest andsafest source of supply  but to throw  a  quite  unnecessary additional burden upon theTreasury and the  taxpayer.    I venture  to  urge that this question should be  considered by the  Cabinet  at theearliest opportunity.                                                                   ^   L OF F.  February 9, 1920.
