          I circulate,  for the information of.mycolleagues, the accompanying notes on  an interviewbetween Major General Greenly and General pilsudski(obtained privately by Vice Admiral Sir J,M. deRebeck, Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Station.)(Intlld)    W,  H.  L.           23.1,20.
NOTES ON           V/ITH GM5HAL PILSUPSKI.19c-11-1919,               Had interview lasting just  under  l  hours with     PILSUDSKI.   He talked freely and was  extremely  interesting.     He was very evidently talking of natters  over which he had     thought much, and on which he had  formed  very definite     opinions.   I should spy a man whose opinions thus  formed,     would be very hard to alter.   He struck me.  as being a     careful3 calculating man,  intensely practical,  a  &quot;Realist&quot;     and not a dreamer, determined to see  things as  they are,     and do away with all illusions. He several times  repeated     that it is to the formation of &quot;illusions&quot;  that most  of     our mistakes are due.               He opened the conversation  by asking  my  opinion     of MIKBPs troops and his progress.  I  said  I had no     first hand experience, but that from  the  latest reports     from our Mission there DEN IE IN seemed to  be doing  very well,     and the organisation behind his line was steadily improving:     I believed that his soldiers were  fighting  well and  that liis     cause generally was a successful and  improving  one.               Prom that time on he did most of  the  talking.               He said he would speak quite frankly and that he     had no great confidence in LStlHONj  or in any  other Russians,     D&apos;MIKJN and all of the Anti-3oXshevic Russians  were  making     the seme mistakes, the two greatest  being the  undertaking     of &quot;operations for effect&quot; and the attempt  to  hurry forward     and sweep over vast distances without securing the necessary     firm basis from which to work by means of proper organisation     and adminsitration,  He said he had very good information&apos;     now, and in addition to that he was  from past  experience     very well acquainted with the Russians: he said that the     lack of organisation behind EKBflKIN1 s lines was deplorable     and the trouble  constantly rising behind them in the form     of peasant revolts  and other risings were the  inevitable  and     natural consequences.  He said that those who  thought that     the end of Bolshevism was near or that the Bolsheviks could     be successfully  defeated  in this offhand way ?/ere the     victims of illusion:  it could only be done by stages, every     stage being  secured by proper organisation and administration,     and thus forming  a  secure basis for the next move,     &quot;OTIKIN will be  beaten again, now on his left flank: he     has left it  dangerously weak and in. the air,  end he has np     organisation by which he  can quickly and adequately reinforce     it in  case of need&quot; He said the risk of these &quot;operations     for effect&quot; was  always great,  and that before undertaking     &apos; hem the price to be paid in  case of failure must be    .  considered.   It was  usually much too high  since it generally     involved the  complete  demoralisation for a longer or shorter     time of the  troops which had unsuccessfully taken part in     them, He said that  there had been several  instances and     mentioned i\JIl NITOH*s  attempt  on Petrograd; he said he knew beforehand that
knew beforehand that such an attempt was dooco^d to failure,the necessary means and organisation were txaupletelylacking, and the result of failure had been the utterdemoralisation of the whole of General YUDENITCH5s force.I said that we now had a large number of British officers with MTIKIH and that they were largely employed in helpinghim with the organisation and administration behind his lines,and I was confident that those matters were dteadily improving;He said that if we could improve that we should be doing amost useful piece of work. In addition to the faults of,theleaders, rushed operations for effect, wiWpjjt^ad^quate mejansancHL a olc^of organ 1 s ation, the re was alscT tns ggnera^jiulFofall Russians - tfcat they &apos;^norYi e^Ti^tin ,  thay^ill^only Tight for some cause which really appeals tb^tbeajp^jforIbdtT          The Bolsheviks, he said, had a great advantage inthis respect, because they had a cause, it was a horriblecause, but still  a cause that they understood and thatappealed to them and in his opinion EENIKHSMs troops were notinspired by any cause which they understood or which appealed to them, and they were chiefly induced to fight by loot: he  .had certain information that they were looting in wholesalefashion and this must destroy the morale of any troops and wasdestroying their discipline and morale. I questioned this,and said it was not in accordance with my information, but hereplied that his information on the subject was quite certainand that he knew the Russians, and  it was their instinct,traditions and history -  &quot;the Cossacks not loot&quot;, Kyoyonan,          The Bolsheviks had another advantage, they had asystem, again a horrible  system, but none the less a system:wherever he had occupied  territory  taken from the Bolshevikshe had  found evidence of  a system in vogue, and a system that had worked successfully, he had often been struck withits completeness and much written material had been captured in various places showing a very complete system. He said the Bolsheviks had good administration and a good system ofkind -  a horrible kind he frequently repeated, because thewhole organisation of these things was done by the Jews, andthey were good and clever organisers.          The Russians themselves were not good organisers,he knew it well and to his cost during the time of POLAND&apos;s&quot;esclavage&quot;: The Jews are, and the Bolsheviks make use ofthem, whereas the anti-Bolshevik Russians cannot employ Jews.He then again repeated that if we think we are going tofinish  with the Bolsheviks soon, we are forming &quot;illusions&quot;:he was  himself under no illusion and had none of the essentialsnecessary for an advance  in the winter, neither the clothing,food nor transport, and he had no intention of attemptingfurther operations now that the winter conditions, andexceptionally severe ones, had come as they had, very early.          He believes that by the Spring all Russian forcesBolshevik and anti-Bolshevik, will  be reduced by one-half, :owing to the conditions which will prevail, partly owing toactual  death and sickness, partly to desertions.  He said  ;;the winter may make a great difference to the Bolshevik cause,but it  would be folly to  assume that it will finish it: still,there are signs that it is on the downward wane, though he^sees no proof that it will necessarily be a rapid downfall,     1.   They are fighting less well and less willingly:they never liked fighting, but they were carried away by                                        the cause and ........
the cause and now that happens less often,  and less oftencan they be induced to fight,     2.   Captured prisoners and deserters  give evidencethat the faith in the cause and the enthusiasm for it are getting less, -     3.   Leaders are looking for &quot;asiles&quot;  in case of trouble, and he thinks therefore      thev  too are losingconfidence in success.          There are also certain signs that they intend towithdraw eastwards and live in the country  further from thepresent .scenes of fighting: he believes there is plenty qffood for them and that there will be no great difficulty inthat respect in living on the country.          On my asking whether he meant they might evenevacuate MOSCOW he replied he thought it was not unlikely.          As regards the P0L3S he said1 tliey had thecomplete moral ascendancy over the Bolsheviks: he himselffelt that he had always beaten them, he had never had togive up except in very small bits? and very temporarily,any ground he had once won, and this gave him enormous selfconfidence and moral strength and he felt he would alwayscontinue to beat them,, but then he never attempted morethan he could dc and always made a firm basis of eachstage by adequate organisation.  He should in the Springcontinue to advance by stages.  The Bolsheviks felt thistoo, and had given up the idea that they could succeedagainst the POLES and they were fighting very poorly, and half heartedly against him.          There were always liable to be small, isolateddetachments of desperate fanatics who fought really woljbut as  an army they knew they could not oppose the Poles,and there was no combination of good fighting against him.          As regards the Chinese, who often put up adesperately hard fight, he had, up till now been unable  to make up his mind to the  cause which sustained them,he was  still too ignorant of their mentality and  ideas toknow what made them fight as they  sometimes did.          I asked     whether anticipated difficulties shouldhis troops meet those of DMIKIN: he said that they werenowhere in contact, and would not be for the present, butthat he had given strict orders that when they did meetlocal  Commanders should at once arrange a line of demarcation,  &quot;Of course&quot; he added ,rl should not  go back,and if  any of his troops cross the line arranged  I shoulddisarm,  tlxem&quot;. I said I need not impress upon him howvitally important my Government considers it that noconflict should take place between them; he agreed and said he was also most anxious to avoid it,          I then got on to the question of closer  touchand better understanding in order  to make previousarrangements in good time by which points of friction couldbe foreseen and guarded against.  He then at considerablylength  described the enormous difficulty existing  owing                                        to their being......
u.to there being no tangible Russia, no representative onthe spot and easily accessible with whom he could talk,and who would accept the responsibility of deciding in thename of Russia, and really repre Siting Russia.  Hesaid there was&apos;first the idea of  &quot;getting into touch withKOLCHAK&quot;, as the Russian Government: KOLCHAK was beyondthe URAL MOUNTAINS and the idea was fantastic.  He said &quot;i will speak quite frankly, I have  been quite unable to getanyreasonable officer to accept  the task of liaison officerwltE^OLCHAK&apos;f&quot;the dlsTancas are too great, the isolation andseparation too impossible, how can a men with KOLCHAKbeyond the URAL mountains possibly usefully convey to himm$u ideas and decisions, which have to be formed here andon the spot and must change with  changing circumstances:a11 reasonable officers have asked to decline the task andI  doh?t blameTthem and have had to employ others a farce.          &quot;Dealing with KOLCHAK as the Russian Government is really fantastic0.          &quot;As to DSN.IKIN he refuses to talk on political issues and says he is not the Russian Government, only a soldfer &apos;and not even Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Forces.          &quot;Then a gentleman arrived from PARIS (he referred toM.K0UTEP0W, who was 1st Secretary at ROME, and came here ona  special Mission); I asked him who he represented and hesaid M.SAOT0Y:  I asked who SASQNOV represented andwhether he (KOUTIPOW) was able to take the responsibilityof speaking in the name of Russia: he said he feared not andso what was the use of my talking to him ?&quot;          I have previously mentioned this same difficulty as affecting Roumania when reporting on Roumanian views,  and find it again emphasised here.          The  removal of this at  present very real obstacle toall real progress appears to me to be a very urgent and veryvital needo  Perhaps a solution could be found by theformation of a re-oresentatiive body, say representatives  ofthe three Russian&quot; forces of DENIKM, KOLCHAK, and YUDMTCH,and some civilians representing M.-SAS0NOV, who can and must bemade to answer for Russia and should be quickly and easilyaccessible by the countries chiefly concerned, i.e. roumania and POLAND.          Negotiation is impossible when there is no-one tonegotiate with and in my opinion  a very great danger existsof differences so serious as to involve grave risk of warboth between POLAND and RUSSIA and ROITiANIA and RUSSIA  unless some definite understanding can be arrived at in regard to matters of great concern to all three countries.  under present, conditions foresight is rendered useless; dangers canbe foreseen but there is no adequate means of avoiding  them.          Holding the views they  do and estimating theirrespective strength as they do it is not impossible that poland and ROUMANIA may take the  matter into their own hands and solve their differences with  Russia in combination.  I donot say it is probable and I am sure both countries would beaverse to
averse to such a solution, &quot;but events might compel them tosuch a course if the Entente does not help by making someother solution possible a solution by negotiation insteadof by arras of threats,          I must here emphasise the fact which is very patentto all who have discussed the matter with responsible P0.LESor ROTJHMIABfS that neither of these countries estimates ,Russian strength at the Russian va-\:.rtion of it, and neitherare at all impressed, with the idea ot a rapid; growth of anew Russian colossus: both believe they could, single handeddeal with DiailKISf-fs Army or with any strength that russia is likely to be able ta produce in the near future. Bothlook upon themselves as forming &quot;the future barrier againstRussian imperialistic expansion westward15 as well as againstpresent Bolshevik demonstration in the seme direction. Bothappear to me as anti-Bolshevik, as is ESSIES, and as anti-German.          Whsn speaking of advancing in the Spring PILSUBSKIwas certainly speaking in connection with the Bolsheviks, and what he said was entirely unconnected with any idea of hostility to OTIKJN.  When,, however, he was discussing thepossibility of his and DENIM&apos;&apos;s troops meeting he was mostemphatic in stating that he would not of course go back.In&quot;the latter connection he also said that one has to take into account in military operations the opinions of &quot;both thearmy and the people:  it is necessary that both know  clearlywhat they are fighting for0  He said that neither polish army or people would fight  if he told them they were  toconquer ground merely to hand  it over to EENIKIN or anybodyelse; and he said the same  thing held good with regard tothe peoples in the territory occupied, they too cannot be told their territory is being  occupied by the POLES msrelyto be handed over to the Russians.          I did not take what he said to mean that he wouldnot be ready to come to some  reasonable  compromise with  regardto future frontiers, if only there WSTQ  some  authority with whom to deal, but he did    -&apos;  intend, I think, to make it  clearthat he was not going to undertake operations merely  to  handback territorial results  to the Russians: and he conveyed theidea that he regarded the future frontier of POLAND as not further west than the present positions gained on  the EKK3SINA.          In speaking of the future  of Russia he againrepeated &quot;we must have no illusions&quot;.  He said there  were two important factors to be reckoned with, first Russia wa3  verytired, in fact thoroughly exhausted, and secondly  she had destroyed, and continued daily to destroy her &quot;techniauevivante et technique morte&quot; - byMtechnique vivante&quot; he explained that he meant these men who work with their heads aswell as these who work with their hands  in creating and  in working thar various organisations and equipment which go tomake up the &quot;administration&quot; in all  its&quot;branches of a moderncivilised state.  The Russians themselves had never been goodorganisers and now......
organisers and now that they had so largely destroyed thosethey had they would be entirely incapable of organisingand controlling a modern administration for a united Russia.Individual states would be ahle to nm seme form of adminis-tration. some bettor than otherst depending on the availablematerial left over,, but the Russians themselves9 unaided,would never be able to organise and run the administrationof a centrally controlled Russia.      He considers that there are three possible solutions.      The firste which he regretted to have to admit he.feared was the most natural, was that the Germans should undertake the regeneration of Bussia.     He said they hadmany advantages:   they had the means in men and material,especially they had a very large number of military officersavailable, including good engineers, doctors, etc, eto*, andwho were good organisers; they also had a large number  ofcivil functionaries for whom, now they had lost theircolonies and parts of their  empire  there was no work at home,in addition there  were plenty of small  tradesmen now out ofemployment and who would gladly go     and start afresh inRUSSIA:   then  the  Germans had done  a good deal in RUSSIAalready  and understood  the Russian  pretty well,, and did not get on with him so badly.    He considered that  this solution would be a great  disaster for POLAND and also for  theEntente  Powers - but  that it will  take  shape unless sanedefinite steps are  taken to  find another.,      The second possible solution  was  that one of  the  great powers,  such  as         or ENGLAID  should undertake  thebusinesso  Ho  said to  speak  quite frankly he doubted whetherSNGLAND., who he would most like  to  see  do it was  in a positionto  do so. whether  she  could  find the necessary material,especially  in men,  with  her  present vast  territories  to administer, and new  colonies thrown open by  the war;  all hermaterial and  energy  would, he  thought,  be  taken up in other directions,       The  only other  solution which appeared  to him possiblewas  that the  rOLES should  assist RUSSIA to  reorganise herself.He  said  they  had  the  advantage  of well  understanding RUSSIAand being  of  Slavonic  blood, and  the  language  question  would present  ho  difficulty  the Russians  would regard them less  asforeigners  than any other  people  and  he thought would welcome their  assistance,  &apos;  If,  however, POLAND was  to  undertake thework  she would have  to receive  much help from the Entente   .Powers  and  she could only  proceed by  stages.  province byprovince-   it would be beyond her  means to  tackle all russians  a  whole  and at once POUND would have  an enormous  drain on her  available  resources  for  her own needs,  and requirenearly  all  her men,  energy aljd material to  build  up her own state.,  but  with the  advantages  she  possessed as regardsnearness,  consanguinity, knowledge, language^  etc,  he considered  that with tne help of  the  intents9  especiallyENGXiAflD, she  could undertake the re-organisation  of RUSSIA,by  stages  he  especially emohaaisedo      fhether the idea underlying this  is  the  creation  ofbuffer  states under POLISH influence  between  her  and a                                   Central Great Russia......
Central Great Russia he gave no indication.   PILSUDSKIis certainly a man who thinks carefully &quot;before he speaks,and who does not say much without some definite object;he of course^ intended what he said to reach the ears ofthe British Government, and from the way he talked aboutthe matter I am sure he has thought much about it, regardsit as practical politics, and has plans in his head to put it into execution,      To sum up. the impressions left on my mind after this interview were chiefly      1,   PILSIIDSKI is very muoh a man to be reckonedwith, a thinker, practical, determined and obstinate (I amtold,he is also an arch-intriguer), he will be very usefulor tiresome and dangerous according to whether we are working in accordance with or against his ideas,      2.   He does not mean to sacrifice any importantPOLISH interest, for instance her territorial  frontiers,according  to his notion,  in favour of the Russians, in ordereither to please the Entente  or  to please  the Russians:  asregards the latter he feels he is in  the master position,and must remain so for a  verv considerable time,      3,   He would be open to a bargain, but will see thathe gets as food as he gives,      4,   He has distinct plans in his head for  assisting the reorganisation of Russia, possibly, I  think probably,with  the idea of buffer states&quot; under  Polish influence  along the Polish border.-,      5,   He is much  impressed  with  the German danger,and anxious  to  combat  it, chiefly with  the assistance  ofENGLAND.      6.   He is  thoroughly anti-Bolshevik and will notwillingly make  any  terms  with Bolshevik Russiao   he thinks  tie Bolsheviks  can be  beaten with the  sword, and mustbe so beaten, but it may  take long.      V.   He dislikes, and mistrusts and  despises Russiansas a  wholeo      8.   He has great admiration  for  ENGLAND,  and places ahigh  value  on her capacity, energy? and methods,    (lgathert however,  though not from nim,  that he  is  not satisfied  with  her policy as  he  sees  it as affectingPOLAND,)                  (Sgd.).  &quot;MI.  GREENLY.
