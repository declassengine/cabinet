(Received 29th.)            No. 151.    Part I. (1.) On lGth -January letter was received by Afridi Mullah from General  &apos;Nadir Khan summoning their  Jirga  to  Jalalabad, with ostensible  motive of settlingfeuds  between Afridis and Shinwaris.  Afridi Jirgas now en route to Jalalabad.   NoJirgas of other tribes have left yet.    (2)  Reports of Wana  Waziri  lashkar about  1,000 strong have secured ShahDaula&apos;s two guns, and have set out  to assistance  of Mahsuds.    (3)  Haji Abdul Razak, who was active in  spreading anti-British propaganda inBajaur country during Afghan War, is said to have  arrived in Wana  Waziri country from Khost, and gone  on to Kaniguram.    (4)  Reported from  Kabul that Amir is becoming alarmed at Bolshevik activities     ^in Turkestan.    (5)  Suric Mission are trying to arrange regular supply of English and vernacularnewspapers from India.    (6)  Reported from (corrupt group) that Afghanistan and Bokhara are discussingan offensive  and defensive alliance.    Part II. (7) Tochi.  One  raider killed  and three captured  in  small skirmishnear Khajuri post.    (8)  Derajat column.  Nothing  to report.    (9)  Following are extracts from report by Climo, dated 2Lst January    &quot; (a) Fight on  14th January was most stubborn, and included many instances of hand-to-hand engagements.  In some cases the reckless charges of Mahsuds compelledour troops to withdraw temporarily, but the troops are now facing  these charges with more  confidence, thereby inflicting  heavier losses on enemy.   Though, the situation atdark that evening was somewhat obscure and  not free from anxiety, I was convinced,from reports received  and by other indications, that the enemy had suffered a seriousdefeat, and my  confidence has proved to be justified.  It is always  difficult.to estimate the enemy&apos;s losses, and, with so many tribes and sub-tribes engaged, I do not suppose the enemy himself knows what they are, hut 1  am of opinion  well over (? 400) havebeen killed or (? corrupt group) wounded.   Further losses were inflicted on enemy  a couple of days later, and I shall (? find out) if  such resolute opposition will be  offeredagain, or if such a large lashkar (?  can) again  be assembled against us. The completedefeat of Mahsuds  is however most desirable, and I  do not  think  they are reallydefeated yet in  spite of  very  heavy casualties they have suffered.   There is no doubtmajority of  tribes are now  very anxious for peace, but the ineconciiables still  remainand will be  difficult to deal with.    &quot; (b) The  work  of the aeroplanes  has been  of the greatest assistance  to  thecolumn.  The offensive  spirit  that animates them and their moral effect on enemy isexemplified by an episode on 14th January. Two planes finding good targets finishedtheir bombs and ammunition some  time before their reliefs  were due to arrive.  Theenemy were harrassing our troops, and airmen knew the departure of our planes wouldbe likely to  he  their opportunity to press  attack.   They therefore remained, and bycontinually diving low at the enemy succeeded in pinning them to their ground, thuspreventing any offensive movement developing  until arrival of fresh planes completewith their ammunition.&quot;    Nos. (7) and (8) only communicated to Press.                                       /
