 Sir WM  Fisher. m.....i &apos; t.....vmit...........      The  following is an attempt to put on record the vievrs wMoh you aud I. Cisoussed together this morning      J&apos;or  nearly a  year HOT the British Treasury and the United States  treasury have been in oomvaunioatlon with each  other on the  subject of Inter-Allied debts.   The United States Tre&amp;surv expresses itself and no doubt is anxious to co-operate with the British Treasury in framing&apos; a oommon  polioy tov&amp;r&amp;a our common debtors.    3ut hitherto our efforts to  oe-operate with the United States Treasury &apos; have almost invariably meant that we have bad to abandon without even putting on formal record the polioies Which we have favourec whether in&apos;great matters&quot; or in small,  and aooept the views of the United States Treasury.    Wot only so, but the polioies  favoured by us have never  reaohed  beyond the individual Offioers of the United States Treasury with whom they have been discussed, end Govt attitude  is almost invariably misrepresented in, the United States of America, because the Unites States ttreasnry^s solo preoccupation lausually to persuade an iinriilia-v congress to. taftt a  small stop forward  in tho direction desired by the  United  states treasury,  and it frequently does the persuading  by putting forward arguments whioh are from our point of view irrelevantand unfair.     S*rom the first the general policy of the British Government in the matter of Interallied Debt lias been tomove as far and ^s fast in the direction of  &quot;Deflation of the vnrldTs balanoe sheet&quot; as we could  persuade  the  United                                        States/
  States  Mrkenry to  go with us,   Our idea has always been  thv.t ultimate repayment by the oontinent.il Governments  of ::iiro&apos;.\* of their  debts to the United Zingclom and the  United  States of .1merica was In faot out of the cuestion,  that the existence  of this mass of external indebtedness  meanwhile lay like a dead weight upon the fcreCit of  continental Europe and made reconstruction even slower and more painful than it needed, to  be,  and  that the  statesmanlike thing to be done was  for  tho  United lin&amp;dom and the United States of America  to make a  &quot;beau geste&quot; by offering to wipe out  the whole of suoh indebtedness by&apos; a stroke of the pen.   We put  this  plan informally before the united States Treasury saying that  we should, like to propose it officially, but that it  was  a little  diffioult for us  to initiate as although it meant that we  should wipe out some  1,600,000,000 cf debt  due to the  United Kingdom it Involved also the wiping out of  a debt  of 600,000,000 due by the  United Zinrdom  to the United States  of Amarloa,  whereas the United States of  America was  not the  debtor of any other Government  and might therefore make  the proposal without its motivos  being open to  any  kind of misconstruction,      The United  States Treasury has from the. first  been horrified v/ith  even the  mention of  suoh a plan. A few individuals  outside  the  United  States Treasury may  have some  inkling of the truth  that  these paper debts must  ultimately  be aanoelled somehow  or other, but  the United  States Treasury itself  seems incapable of appreciating the  -position and congress  as usual  is entirely ignorant  of and  untouched by the realities of the case                                              Our/                       - Z -
     Our &quot;negotiations with the United States Treasuryhare therefore been oonfined to questions of postponement ofinterest and-conversion of short term into long term *obligations.-   But here again while professing anxiety foroo-oper&amp;tjlon the United States Treasury abuses its position asbur creditor and its inability or unwillingness totell Congress, the truth for the purpose of making us aooeptwhatever the United States Treasury wants, and often goes further and demands that-wo shall put forward its views as if they were               it being pressed on/by us.     The.time has:now, we submit, come when the desirability.  &apos;of oontinulng this attitude of one-sided oo-operation shouldbe reconsidered.   In order that we may seours pestpenementof all interest oai iritervallled debts including interest onour debt to the United. States of America., the United S,tateeTreasury cemando that we should officially appear as theauthors of this policy (which weaiae to us only a pis-aller)and should a-pear in the seme what undigfclfiod attitude ofs^qulants to the United States Treasury for relief.     If we are to oontinue the attempt to Oo-operate itseews impossible to avoid .&amp;*inr&apos;ss the United States Treasuryashs.   It is cuite beyond the United States Treasury^ visionto see that a handsome offer of postponement of interestori/rinatia? in appearance at least from the ronerous creditorwould be a far finer method tf ap;oroaoh.   UaJhsr/bunately efrenif the United States Treasury realised this fact, it wouldbe far too much afraid of Congress to aot on It.    &apos; We submit therefore that the possibility ofSignified and independent action by the British Treasuryshoulc1 *.t least be considered as e.:i alternative before further action is tslcen..   v/e submit that it is not possible for the                                              British/
British Treasury officially to put forward a plan for can-oeHation of Inter-Allied Debt if such cancellation involved a gift to the United Kingdom &quot;by the United States oi America,The original i$ea therefore of a wiping out of all Inter-Allied debts including the debt of the United Ei&amp;ajdom to theUnited States of America is not one which could be put forwardofficially by us.     But it is quite  possible for us to say,  without reference to any question of the debt of the Government ofthe United Kingdom to tho Government of the United States ofAmerica,  that we are prepared for our part,  without anyoonditions whatever, to wipe out the debts wwod to us by theGovernments of our European Allies.    (We should I thinkoxoapt Sussia for the time being.   Belgium would also be an exception in so far as her debt to us is to bo converted into German bonds and I think it would be necessary forus to offer similar treatment to the B&amp;mLnions.   Details asto the exact date up to whioh debts are to be  wiped offwould need working out, but soms intermediate  date such asMarch 31st 1919 might be taken).   We should base our proposal on the necessity *f doing some&apos;thing really whichuseful towards setting Europe on its feet and on the disadvant-ages whioh we see in remaining as a Government the creditors ofother Governments.     What are the objections to such a proposal?   Thereare some considerations, e.g. the susceptibilities of e.g.Prance and Italy in accepting a gift from us whioh make it important to think out carefully the method of making theoffer, and so on.   But the really important oonsi derationsare   (l) the effect on sterling exchange;
      (2) the politioal effect involved In the  United Kingdom&apos;s  taking a step in a direction in which the United  States of America may not wish to follow our lead, with the result that co-operation between the two English speaking Powers may not be secured in a matter in which co-operation is most desirable.           As to (B) the difficulties of co-operation have already been discussed.   If we take the step proposed the United States of America will have the choice  ofj      (a) doing nothing to correspond to our action;      fb) wiping out all allied governments debts due to her including  the debt of the United Kingdom.     (e) wiping out other debts, but not that of the United  Kingdom and claiming that in so doing she is&apos; doin  as much as the United Kingdom.     Her choice will be diffioult enough, but it might conoeivably oome to the United States Government pressing (b) upon us, and being glad to make us aooept.     We must however be prepared for either (a) or (o).    It  is extraordinarily difficult to guess what the effect  upon exchange of either (a) or (c) would be.&quot;There would in any case be no immediate increase in the amount  of  sterling or other currencies immediately seeking &apos; a market in New York, while the wiping out of the debts of Continental Europe to the United States of Vnerioa would create a new demand for French and Italian currencies. in New  York and in improving their value might to some exten*  improve the value of sterling.     Perhaps the most probable effect cf (o) wou Id &apos; be slightly to depress sterling in Hew York while                                               reducing/
reducing the discount oil franos and lire ao as to bring -itto a figure not -very -much worse than the discount on sterling.   In the result the market for our exportsto France and it / &amp;y would be improvod,  we should be more likely to secure payment for those exports.in cash,  andthe European Market for the exports of the United. Statesof America would be still more unfavourable than it now is.   Provided that we were given time to make paymentthe burden of our  850,000,000 debt to the United StateBGovernment, although very heavy,  would not I think bean impossible one, and might bring some importantcompensations in opening the markets of the  United States6f America and the world generally to our exports.     Ultimately,  in self-defenee  the United StatesGovernment might be driven to beg us to aooept as afavour the wiping out of our debt to it.     In the meanwhile we should surely have earnedthe gratitude of the world, by recognising now and Atonce the facts of the situation and restoring reality totho discussions of the eoonomios  of to-day,  and by giving new hope to Continental Europe by clearing away,so far as we were able,  the useless obstruction o f a                                    Ivast mass of paper indebtedness between Governments.     I attaoh first drafts of a tentative despatch to Washington and letter to Mr.Bathbone,  to show howif the policy advocated here were adopted,  the formalsteps required would take shape.

Following for Lindsay, British Embassy,  Waahln^gii,     The following letter has boon addressed by british treasury to Mr. Rathbone, United States Treasury representa-tive at Paris    (quote).   Please oommunioate this letterinformally to United States Treasury.     At same time please Inform United States Government asfollows s-     Eia Majesty&apos;a Government are deeply impressed by theserious political dangers involved in the exlstenoe of a vastbody of debts owed by one Allied or Associated Government toanother, and they are convinced that the existence of suchinternational indebtedness forms an almost insuperableobstacle to the recuperation of the world and particularly of continental Europe from the immense strain and sufferingoaused by the war.  They have therefore decided, as a contribution to the economic reconstruction of the world, tooffer to those of the Governments of the British Dominionsand Allied Countries to whom advances were made by his majesty&apos;s Government in connection with the war to cancel the obligations held by His Majesty&apos;s Government which represented the net amount of such advances as at Uoveraher11th,&apos; 1918, subject in qertaln cases to the allowance of some small sets off of comparatively minor importance.  advances made to Russia will; in view of existing politioal conditionsin Russia, be excluded, and special consideration will requireto be given to advances made by the British Government to theBelgian Government which by agreement between the British and belgian Governments of which United States Government are awareare to be exchanged for bonds of the German Government.     In view of this decision, His Majesty1a Government areno longer directly concerned in the questions which have beenunder discussion for some time between the British and united States Treasuries in regard to the exact terms uponwhioh interest should be postponed and short term obligations                         -  7 -                      converted-
oonverted into long torn obligations in tho case of advances by the United States Treasury to the Governmentsof the European Allies who are debtors both to tho UnitedStates Government and to the British Government.  Theydeeire however to say that they have no intention ofrequiring very early repayment of such of the obligations of the Governments in question as represent advances madeby the British Government since November 11th, 1918.  Withregard to the obligations of the British Government heldby the United States Government, His Majesty1s  Governmenttrust that the United States Government will be willingto postpone interest and to accept conversion into longterm bonds or. the lines of the proposals which have beenunder discussion for some time.  Hie Majesty&apos;s Governmenttake this&quot; opportunity to plaie on record the request already made informally that the United States Government will agree to postponement of interest on suoh  obligations for aperiod  of three years from April and May 1919.
Bear Mr, Hath &quot;bone,       In -continuation cf previous correspondence and&apos;dieouaeions, and partioularly with roforenoa to the eonveraa-tions between yourself and me in Paris during the last  fortnight,I am directed by tho Chancellor of the Exchequer to place onformal record tho attitude of tho British Government in rogaydto the question of Inter-Allied Indebtedness,       As a reBult ef the advance Made by Ohe British Governmentto the Governments of its Allies arid IttainionS for war purposesfrom August 1914 to the present,,.dftte, tho British Governmentholds obligations of those Alliesand Eowiriions to a total ofapproximately ki;800,000,Q&amp;6.,   ,0f this total a sum of about J 60,000,000 representing advances made to the Government ofRussia, must be left out of  consideration for present purposesowing to political conditions Ah Russia at ihe present tine.Similarly as a result of advances mads by th* United StatesGovernment  since  its entvy into the ytjur in April 1917, theUnited  States Government holds obligations of the Governments of continental Europe to a total if  ap$3*oximately $f,000,000,000and  obligations  of the British Government&apos; to a total pfapproximately $4,250,000,000*  The1 ^overnwient  6f France -hasalso ,made. considerable advances to some of the-other AlliedGovernment Si  These  advances represent, under  the f*rm of temporary. loansK. a part  of the  sontribution made by the creditor Governments to  tke  conduct  of a war for the  dofonae of liberty and democratic  institutions,  and it. has  appeared to the British Govornment to be most undesirable that  at  a moment when that war has bovi brought to a  su8cAseful  conclusion  the oxistenc^ of this vast mass  of  Inter-Allied debt should  V allowed in  any  way to militate  against mutual  goodwill and friendly intercourse b(*twe*n ths  victorious  Governments., ^The British Government is deeply impressed with th* s^rioue  , political dangers-involved in the existence  of this, gr^atr *bo*dy of international indebtedness, and it feels  further that  urtil  a satisfactory solution is raaoh^d of  the  financial, and economic problems connected therewith,  such debt must&apos; inevitably  form  an                             *-* Q
almost insuperable obstacle to  the  recuperation of th* world and particularly of contin-ntal Europe  from tha immense-  strainand Buffering caused by the War.       In thes* circumstances tha British Treasury has on several oooasions suggested informally  to repres-mtat iv**c of theUnited Statue Treasury that thfi British and American  Governments.as the two chief cr-ditor Governments,  should consult tos*th*rwith a view to finding some solution whioh would  tend to thedeflation of thfl world&apos;e balane* sheet.  Hitherto these suggestions have not been put en formal record, and discussionhas been confined to the minor questions of a postponement  ofinterest on Inter-Alliod obligations and tho conversion  into^ong term bonds of the short term obligations by  which thovarious advances are at present represented.       It had been the expectation  of tho British Treasurythat the United States Treasury, whioh is concerned  i$ thein the matter only as a creditor,  would tako the  lead informally proposing measures for such postponement and conversionwhioh thus have been adopted by the British Treasury inrelation to the debts of other Governments w%ich  it  holds,  sothat the two creditor Governments eould offer such measures as their tioint contribution towards a partial amelioration  ofthe present financial  and economic disorders of the  world.It appears however that the United States Treasury  desiresthat  such action  should bo taken only  in response to requests for assistance from the various debtor Governments  and thatthe extent of tho temporary relief to iGo afforded should bebased upon a careful  survey of  the relative ability or inability of tho  debtor Governments to meet their obligations.&apos;        It appears to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that thikmethod  of approach  involves and illustrates the very politicaldangers to which  reference was  rmdo above, and he regret8 thatafter full consideration he has come to the conclusion that itis not  possible for him any longer to  subordinate to tho
                                                           61)1wishes Of the united States Treasury the views  strongly holfl *nythe British Government; o% to the inadequacy of  these  proposals,both in form and in substance,  for dealing -with the grave  con-ditio.es requiring to be faced.   He regrets exceedingly that hehas not been able to secure the adhesion of the United states treasury to s plan of aoticu in      he would have felt  able  to concur, and it is not without much hesitation that he has  nowfelt compelled te  propose the taking by the British  Governmentof independent action in the matter of Inter-Allied indebtednessin which the United States Government is so closely concerned.He feels however what the true interests of the world in thisgrave moment cannot be served by partial palliatives  such  as temporary postponement of interest on the debts of those governments of the Allies of Continental Europe and the conversion of those debts into the for$. of long terra bonds, withprovisions1 attaohed for the payment of interest and repayment of principal which are either incapable of being carried out  tothe letter, or ar* calculated to perpetuate the political  dangersand economic oppressiveness1 which are in his vi*w inseparable from the existence of these  Inter-Allied debts.        In these  circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government hasdecided to propose to those  of the  Governments of the dominionsand Allied Powvrs to whom advances  were made by the BritishGovernment  in  connection with the war that, as a  contribution  byHis Majesty!0  Government/to  tho  economic reconstruction, of thc^world,  the  British Government should cancel the obligationsheld  by His ltajeBty&apos;s  Government which represented the netamount  of  suoh advances as  at November  11th 1918,  advances made to Russia will,  for the reasons previously mentioned, be excluded,  and  special  consideration will require  to  be given tothe advance  to Belgium, which by agreement betweon tho Britishand Belgian Governments aro to  be  exchanged for bonds of theGerman Government.   The offer  of cancellation  will further besubject in the caso  of certain  of  the  Governments concerned totho allowance  by those Governments  of  certain  small  sets off ofeomparatively  minor Importance.
     .  A copy of this  letter  is  &quot;being  ncnt to H.B.M,representative at Washington  for this  infomat ion and forinformal communication to  the United States Treasury, and atthe same time an official  comnunioation  is being addressed tothe United States Government  informing it of the proposed action of the British  Government and formally requesting thoUnitod States Government to agree to the postponement for aperiod of three years  of interest on British obligations holdby the United States Treasury and to the conversion  of thoseobligations into long term bonde en the  lines of the arrango-ments which have formed the subject of iiocussion bet&quot;reon thetwo Treasuries for some tine  past.- 12 4
