Memorandum by the Chairman,     On October 14th, 1919, the War Cabinet came to thefollowing decision as to the action which should be taken tocarry on the work which had been performed by the CabinetStrike Committee during the Railway Strike in September and october (War Cabinet 630,  Minute 8 (a))      To appoint a &quot;National Emergency Committee&quot;      of the War Cabinet and to approve the following      recommendations of the Strike Committee in      regard to its constitution and functions(l)   The new Cabinet Committee will  take  over     the functions of the Industrial Unrest     Consult tee and will  be entrusted with the     executive powers of the War Cabinet  Strike     Committee, the said powers to be exercised     as and when the War Cabinet may direct,     to meet industrial  crises in the future.(&amp;)   The Committee will  be entitled  &quot;The  Supply     and Transport Coma&amp;ttee of the  &quot;War Cabinet&quot;,     and will be composed as followsThe Minister of Transport (in the Chair).The Home Seoreijary.The President of the Board of Trade,The Food Controller.The Minister of Labour.The Shipping Controller.Lieut-Colonel L.

     I now wish to report to the Cabinet the action which has been taken to carry out the above directions.     In the first place, the report of the Supply and transport committee has been completed.   The Report is of great lengthand consists of the following sections   1.  Introductory paragraph;   2.  Terms of reference;   3.  A summary showing the action taken by the Supply and       Transport Committee and its Sub-Committee since the       Railway Strike in September - October, 1919;   4.  A short history of the Industrial Unrest Committee of       the !Yar Cabinet;   6.  A statement of the events which led up to the Railway       Strike in September - October, 1919;   6.  A general review of the work of the Strike Committee       during the Hallway. Strike in September - October, 1919;   7.  A statement of the constitution of the Supply and       Transport Sub-Committee;   8.  Summaries of the Reports of the Intelligence Commissioners       sent out during the strike by the Supply Priority Committee;   9.  Summaries of the Reports of Departments and other bodies       who assisted in dealing with the strike (18 in number.).     It will be observed that the Report does not make recommendations for the remedying of defects which have beenbrought to light.   The Committee are of opinion that the most   .convenient and practical course is to make their report purelyhistorical ani that the specifying of defects in the organisationcreated during the last strike and the making of recommendations for improvements in that organisation, should be done by meansof memoranda to the Cabinet on particular questions as they arise,in oases where these questions are of sufficient importance torequire conslderatibn by the Cabinet./
This course has already been adopted and I have sulsmitted to  theCabinet Memoranda relating to &quot;A suggested permanent organisa-tion for meeting strikes.&quot; (CP. 97) and to &quot;Protect ion&quot;(CP. 490).  A further Memorandum on the suggested permanent organisation for meeting strikes (C.3?* ?0l) is being circulated.This last Memorandum, makes recommendations which affeatpractically all the.activities of the Supply and TransportCommitt ee.      The object therefore-for which the Supply and TransportComraitiee wa^s  established has been very largely accomplishedand  I desire to ask the Cabinet to  consent to the dissolution ofthe  Committee.  Personally  1 think that if it became known that I was acting as Chairman of a  Committee, the energies ofwhich were concentrated on what Labour would term &quot;strikebreaking&quot;, my  position as&apos;Minister  of Transport would bemuch prejudiced.      If the Cabinet approve my suggestion that the Supply aridTransport  Committee should  be dissolved,  it will be necessarythat the responsibility of  giving effect  to Cabinet -decisions on the Memoranda referred tc above  and  of  carrying to a  con-conclusion the  consideration of outstanding  questions  should betransferred  to the  Departments  concerned.  The  chief outstanding questions  are  the following1*     Cpal Stocks.  At  its last meeting, the Supply  and transport committee  decided that unless priority  were given to the carriage of.coal over  the railways  and  in  the  shipping  services,and  unless steps were  taken to  limit  the  export  of  coal,  itwould  be  impossible to  increase  stocks  to  a safe level.       The  Coal Mines  Department  are at  the moment engaged in working out  figures which will  show the amount  of tonnage whichthe  railways and the  shipping  services  will have to provide  if stocks  of  coal are  to  be  raised to  the  desired level of threeweeks1  supply  in the  oase of household  coal and of  four weeks&apos; supply in  the  case  of  coal  for  railways and public  utilities. I suggest  that this problem should  be left to,be dealt  with
&quot;between the Coal Mines and the Tr&amp;nopo^TtopaTtmcnts,  who  should^in conjunction, make such recommendations ae may he  neeeasaryto the Cabinet.2,    ReoruitinftftvyVolunteer Labour durin^^a ^Strike,.  Inaccordance with a decision taken at the last meeting of theSupply and Transport Committee, the minister of Labour has established a Committee to consider schemes for co-ordinatingcentres of recruiting in all districts&apos; if a strike occurs.  ThisCommittee will report dirdot to the Minister of Labour, and i suggest that the Minister of Labour should, in turn, bring thematter, if he thinks fit, before the Cabinet.3*    Proposed Bill giving Emergency Powersr  At the request ofthe Supply and Transport Committee, the Home Office and theScottish Office are drafting a Bill which will provide for thegrant of all necessary powers to the Government In the event ofa great industrial torise3.  The existence ef the Bill will remainsecreti and the Bill will not    produced until the occasion arises for ite introduction into Parliament.  I suggest that theHome Secretary should be made taeponsible for the drafting ofthe Bill and ^or its introduction at the proper time.      To am up, I  should be glad if the Cabinet would approveaction on the following linesi*      (i) That the  Supply and Transport Committee and its          Sub-Committee should be dissolvedj     (il) That eonsideratlen of the outstanding questions          referred to above and any ethers that may arise          should be left to the Ministers who are most          concerned, who should report if necessary direct^          to the Cabinet;    (iii) That responsibility for giving effect to  Cabinet          decisions which have been takea in regard to          questions referred to the Cabinet  by the  Committee          ehoul.1 be placed en the Apartmente concerned, whs          should in future report to their Ministers and not          to the Supply and Transport  Committee for any further          necessary direction!.                            ,..*.*..*..**                               (Signed)  ERIC GKBEES,                            * 4 **Ministry of Transport,    26th January,- 1920.
