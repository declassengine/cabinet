This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Mfrlyrty&apos;s Gvvwr^nt          I circulate the attached Report to the Cabinet, as I think it is well worthy of their attention.       It is written by  the Intelligence Department of the High Commissioner of Constantinople, and is forwarded by the commands-. in-Chief..            &apos;   (Intlld.)    W.H.L.                           2. 2.  20.
                                                          &apos; 0 &apos;1                                        25th  Deoember .1919u          The recent Bolshevik s$ccessei3 are likely to give an imoetus to what is, it is submitted, one of the mostkinortant of Bolshevik aims, namely, to turn the Moslemworld against the British Empire,          It may be doubted whether this aim, and thereality of the dangers to be apprehended therefrom, are as fully realised as they should be,     2,   It is recognised  that no Allied Power hasincurred  the hatred of the Bolsheviks so deeply as GreatBritain,  who is regarded by them as their most formidableenemy.    In order to  inflict injury on  the British Ikpire.the bolsheviks will use any instrument  and any device, anawill readily feign  to disavow their own principles ifthereby they oan enlist alliei;  in their anti-Britishmachinations.    No principles, for example,  are morefundamentally incompatible  than those  of Bolshevism andIslam;  no two systems have loss in common.    YetBolshevism is making  determined, and by no means whollyunsuccessful attempts, to delude Moslems into believing that the  Moslem world would do  well to  ally  itself withBolshevism in war against the British  Empire,    Theseattempts&apos; are being  made  at  the  present moment in  Turkey,Trans-Caucasia, Persia,  Turkestan8 Afghanistan, India,Syria, Arabia,  and  Egypt;   and  it is submitted  that  theymerit  the most  serious attention,     3.   Skilfully making  use  of every circumstance  lendingitself  to mis-interpretation  or distortion,  tha Bolshevikshave  succeeded  to make large  numbers of Moslems in various parts  of  the Near and Middle  East honestly believe  thatGreat  Britain is  the  enemy  of Islam.     The despatch of-a- Greek Irmy  of (foeupation co the Moslem province  of Aidin,with its  deplorable results,  has been  a useful and muchused argument.     The delay in concluding p&amp;ace witii Turkeyresulting in the .ri e of the  National  Movement and theBonikin, towards Moslem Daghestan and Azerbaijan^Moreover, the failure of the-British Government (at all events, to the Oriental mind) to inflict drastic punishmenton the Amir for his insolent aggression, has tended tomake the dupes of the Bolsheviks believe that the BritishEmpire can be defied with impunity,          Yory skilfully, too, the Bolsheviks are contrivingto turn the somewhat vague and unformed aims of the Paa-Islaaio movement, such as it is-, into anti-British channels.Afghanistan, etc, to meet at SivaSc    This conference, ifit meets, will no doubt indulge in much antMritishpropaganda;  and although:any deputies attending such a     40   An unfortunate factor in the situation is thatthese activities are creating an atmosphere of suspicionagainst Islam in Great Britain, where public opinion is not always sufficiently informed to distinguish between what isrepresentative and what is not.    To this atmosphererecent events in Egypt have very naturally contributed.
Q AO          It would sees most desirable that gtepa should betaken to prevent a barrier of mutual distrust from growingup between Great Britain and the Moslem world.    It issuggested that H*M* Government sight with this object inview make some conspicuous public pronouncement8 emphasisingthat Great Britain is now as ever the friend of Moslems;and that from the Moslem side similar pronouncements shouldbe evoked from, say. King Hubs in,  tiff Emir Ire i sal. theiga Khan, etc,   IV is also submit teds Very tentatively, thata more cordial attitude might be adopted by the british authorities  to the e^-Semissi, Sidi lhmed? now living inthe neighbourhood of Constantinople,,    Sidi Ahmed professesto be very pro-British, but his advances have always been snored by our authorities from a sense of loyalty to theitalianso     He still wikdds considerable influence inPan-Islamic  circles9 (incidentally, he girded the presentfjultan of Turkey with the sword of jOamanJ and he might conceivably  prove most useful to us.     I submit tnat weare under no such obligations to the  Italians (who areintriguing against us both here .and in Egypt) as to refrain,out 01 deference to them, from utilising&apos;&apos; Sidi Ahmed, should it be found  that he could be profitably used/&apos;     .5.   I  further submitv.that  the Bolsheviks1 menace  tothe Far East is a very real Ona-n irrespective of whetherthey new succeed in Eussia? or whether they  fail*   If  theyfail, and carry out their threat to retire via  Turkestaninto Western Oriiha, they may  there x;ind much fertile soilfor  their doctrines.    ftuite recently, for  example, it hasbeen reported that  the Koreans, wear!ea-.with&apos; Japaneseoppression,  have taken  to Bolsnevidmo   The&apos;&apos;$mir  ofBokhara  is understood to be strongly  opposeto Bolshevism;and  if properly supported, he should  prove a valuablestumbling-Dloox to  the Bclsheviks? &quot;Drang nach  OstenJ7     6.   It is submitted that  two ways whereby  theBolslevik plan  to deceive Islam  can be checked  are     (l)  The adoption by the Conference, in  drawing up  theTurkish Peace Treaty, of  the principle that  nopredominantly Ottoman districts are  to be placed underGreek rule;     (2)  Early recognition by  the Peace Conference of  theindependence of Azerbaijan, which  the Bolsheviks  are working  hard to win over,
