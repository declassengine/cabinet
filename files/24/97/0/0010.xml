^^MKB^&quot;&apos;       MEMORiNM FOR  CiiBINST             I circulate, for the i-ifcrmation of the   Cabinet, a Bill to facilitate the enforcement in   England and Ireland of maintenance orders made in   the Oversea Dominions and vice versa, together with   a covering Memorandum.  It is proposed to introduce   this Bill into Parliament during the forthcoming   session.   The main principles of the Bill were agreed   to by the Committee on Home Affairs at a meeting on1$ j&amp;bh June 1919 on the understanding that I should   confer with the Secretary of 8Gotland in regard to   the exclusion of Scotland from the Bill,   After dis-   cussion, it has been decided to exclude Scotland: a   slight  alteration has also been inserted at the wish   of the  Secretary of State for Home Affairs to indicate   that the expression &quot;maintenance  order&quot; does not   include an order of affiliation,                                           L * S&apos;.

Confidential.   Maintenance  Orders  (Facilities  for               Enforcement)  Bill.                     MEMORANDUM.    The  object of this Bill is  to  facilitate the enforcement inEngland and Ireland of maintenance orders made in the overseasdominions and vice versa.  The  origin of the Bill is a resolution passed by the  Imperial Conference in 1911.    The  cases for which  provision has to  be made fall under two heads:     (1) Where after the making  of  a  maintenance  order the          husband  (or other person  liable for maintenance) has          gone to another part of the Empire.    (2) &quot;Where the  husband or other person  liable has gone to          another part of  the  Empire before the making of          any maintenance order.    As to cases falling under the  first head the Bill  adopts theprinciple of  the Judgments (Extension) Act, 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Viet.c. 54), by enabling an  order  obtained in  one country to be registered in  the courts  of  another country, and  when soregistered to be enforceable in that country.    In cases falling under the  second head the Bill proposes toauthorise the  making of a  provisional order  in  the  absence ofthe husband or other  person liable  which will have no  effectunless confirmed by a court in  the country to which the husbandhas gone.    The procedure  contemplated by the Bill in the case (e.g.)of a  husband who leaves  his. wife   in England, and  goes toanother  part  of the Empire where  corresponding legislation  isin force, is as follows:         * &apos;    (1) The wife would apply, ex parte, to a court of summary          jurisdiction  in England for a maintenance order.    (2) The court, if satisfied that a prima facie case  was made          out, would make a provisional  order and send to the          Secretary of  State  a certified  copy  of  it,  together          with the depositions  taken on the proceedings and          a statement showing the  legal  grounds on which the             21-1               a
           husband could have resisted the making of the order           had he appeared, and furnishing any available details           which  would  facilitate  the  finding and identification           of the husband.     (3) These  documents would  be  sent to the Overseas Govern-           ment concerned, whose  duty it would become to try           to ascertain  where the husband  resides.   When this           has been ascertained the documents would be delivered           to the proper court,  which  would  thereupon issue  a           summons or  other  process calling on the husband to           show cause why the order should not be confirmed.     (4s) If the husband does not appear to  the  summons, the           court will have power forthwith to confirm  the order,           which  will thereupon become of full force and effect.           If the  husband does  appear it will be open to him to           take any objection to the  confirmation of the order           which he might have taken to its being made had he           been a party to the original proceedings.     (5) If the husband  raises  any defence which necessitates the           taking  of farther evidence in England, the case will be           remitted  to the courts in England  for the purpose.     Provision is made for the variation andrevocation of orders and  as  to  appeals. .     All  the  Dominions, with  the  exception   of  some  of  theprovinces  of  Canada, have  accepted the  principle  of the Bill,and  have  undertaken to pass  reciprocal legislation.   In the  caseof Australia, legislation will  be passed by  the CommonwealthParliament in respect of  the Commonwealth  courts  and by theState Parliaments in respect  of the  courts in each of  the  sixAustralian States.
