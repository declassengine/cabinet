Lord Derby quotes the  gist of the French and Italianargument as follows          &quot;You gave us these ships as some sort  of reparation    for the ships that we might  otherwise  have got from the    ScapaFlow fleet.    We want to incorporate  them in our    navies and you say that you will only  hand them over  to    us in such a state that they are notning but hull and    machinery, and will want entire reequipment  at our expense.    If you were going to make use of the gear landed, well    and good - but you are not.    You are  going to destroy  it    because you say  that under the terms of the  Treaty it has  ,  to be destroyed, and you do not wish to do anything that    the Germans might say&apos;was contrary to  their  interests *    Is  that a fair way to  treat Allies?    Cannot you agree    that the gear should be handed over to us?&quot;                         (Intlld.)   W*H,L.                                     30.1.20.\
ft ft3PI,29th January, 1920,          i telegraphed this afternoon giving you shortly our views - and I now attach a memorandum setting these out inrather more detail.             Perhaps  I  might  mention.two  further points:-        (l)   It is  not  correct to  state  that the French  and   Italians  are receiving the ships  for incorporation  in their   navies, as reparation for  the $cap a Plow incident.  These  ships   were allotted to them by the Supreme Council  as  a compensation   for their inability  t* build ships  during the war,  on account   of  military preoccupation.        (2)   had they taken ships  from Scapa instead of  those from   Germany,  the ships would have been in  the same  dismantled   condition.e Eight Hon: The Earl of Derby, K.G.,      &amp;c.,    &amp;c.,   &amp;c.          With regard to the proposals contained in paragraph of Lord Derbyfs telegram:     (l)  The Admiralty regret they cannot agree to proposal (a),          so far as it concerns the transport of the equipment          to a French port.     (2)  Article 192 of the Treaty of Peace stipulates that the(3)(4)war material under consideration will be destroyed orrendered useless, and the Admiralty view has beenconsistent throughout that the terms of the Treatymust be upheld*Any.departure therefrom vyould establish a dangerous precedent, and give the Germans a righteous grievanceof Which they would take full advantage.The whole trouble arises from the fact  that the Frenchand Italians discovered too late that under the termsof  the Treaty and Protocol they would only getdismantled ships.   They tried, therefore, to readtheir own meaning into Article 192, an  interpretationthat cannot be accepted.The Admiralty are perfectly ready to agree to anything which can be accepted as a fair interpretation of theTreaty, but they do not consider that the French and italians can obtain any of the material to which theylay claim, except as compensation for violation of theTreaty, and until su&amp;h violation has been proved and compensation settled, no reasonable argument for removing  to France material dostinod to be destroyed or  rendered useless can be advanced.The Admiralty concur in  the proposals contained inparagraph 9 (b), (c), (d), as modifiedrefusal to accept paragraph 9 (abytheir
