CABINET,fc.P. 536.              DE-CONTROL OF  MEAT.            . /                 Memorandum,, by the^Secre to ry^ for  Scotland *         At  a  meeting  of the  Committee  of Home Affairs held  on    January  14th one of the conclusions reached  Y/as  &quot;that while on    its  merits the  arguments  in favour  of decontrol  were overwhelm-    ing, it  was  impossible to risk any  imputation  of bad faith; and    decontrol  could only be adopted at  once if the Government could    obtain from the farming community such an expression of  assent    as would release them from their  pledge.&quot;          On  January 21st I put the Government case before the    delegates  of the Ghief Agricultural Organisations of Scotland.    The  results  of  this meeting have  been communicated by me to tho    Minister of  Agriculture and to the  Food Controller.   The    Scottish farmers put forward  several minor considerations-such    as their original  reluctance  to accept control,  the fact that    their  cattle and sheep were ,still in hand while  much of  the    English  stock was  already marketed, and the  hardships which    would  be felt by dairymen and feeders of second  and  third    grade  stock.          Their main contention however, and the  one  which,  in my    opinion, is  vital, was that premature decontrol  will have a    serious  effect  upon the future of agriculture.  They regard    the  question of profii or loss as of  less importance than the    feeling  of insecurity which would follow upon  the deliberate    breach of  a  Government pledge.          The Resolution of the National Farmers&apos; Union  of Scotland,    which has  been  circulated as  Cabinet Minute  C.P,,504; confirms    the  views  expressed at the Meeting,,          I understand  that the suggestion has been made  that Meat    should be  decontrolled  in England while control  should  be    maintained in Scotland and Ireland,,   This procedure involves    obvious  difficulties and  disadvantages, but, if  control  is no    longer possible in England; I am  inclined to favour  the  main-    tenance  of control in Scotland for  the following reasons:-          1.    It will  convince the Scottish Farmers  of  the  Govern-    ment&apos;s good faithu          2g    I understand  it is  possible to  continue  the existing    Scottish organisation  independently of England^          3-    In the event  of a strike  in the Spring the problem    of feeding the  great  industrial populations  of Scotland would    be greatly simplified, and large  quantities  of home-killed    meat could be despatched  by sea to  England.          4.    It is not  improbable that experience of  Scottish    control  side by side with English freedom from control  would    induce the Scottish Feeders to release  the  Government from  its    pledge.          Apart from the argument that a breach  of  faith is  involved.    I  am convinced  that  immediate decontrol  in  antagonism  to Scottish    agricultural opinion would be inexpedient on the eve of  the    introduction of agricultural legislation.Scottish Office,31st January,1920.&quot;ROBERT MUJJRO&quot;
