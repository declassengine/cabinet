  THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY  OFHIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT[Crown copyright reserved.  CP.   535-&apos;^^SnMlBtRT  OF   ARMY  ESTIMATES,   1920-21.The net total of the Estimates is 52 millions, thus :-    Gross expenditure     ...     ...    ...     ...     ...   155 millions.    Less ordinary appropriations-in-aid  ...     ...     ...    21134Less extra appropriations-in-aid due from the German     and Dominion Governments    ...     ...     ...    82Net total of Army Estimates  ...   52    2. The Estimates provide for  the maintenance throughout the year of a total of220,000 all ranks of the British Army, excluding those in India paid for by the indian government, and excluding also  the men  on demobilization  furlough during the firstmonth or two of the financial year, the  war-wounded  still on our hands, and grave-diggers in France.  This total of 220,000 compares with a pre-war figure of 173,OOQ.    The number of coloured (mainly Indian) troops  provided for, including the whiteofficers and non-commissioned officers serving with them, is 135,000, as compared with about 9,000 before the wau.    Thus, the total number of troops provided  for, white and coloured, is 355,000 ascompared with 182,000 before the war.    3. The sum of 82 millions repayable by Germany and  the Dominions representscharges for  maintenance  of troops which have been  or  will be included in  ArmyAccounts, and is made up as follows :     Charged  to Vote of Credit prior to  1st April, 1919 :          Repayable by Dominions     ...     ...     ...    ...    34 millions.        &apos;      .,      Germany      ...     ...     ...    ...    13   ,,    Chargeable  to   Army Votes,  1919-1920, repayable  by         Germany      ...    ...    ...     ...     ...    ...    30    Chargeable to  Army Votes,  1920-1921, repayable  by         Germany      ..     ...    ...     ...     ...    ...     5   ,,Total of German and Dominion repayments    ...    82    But the War Office looks  to  the  Treasury to advise how far it is safe to assume that these sums will be  received before 31st March, 1921.  The  net  total of Army-Estimates, put  provisionally above at 52 millions, will require adjustment accordingly.In any case,  unless the  Treasury can assure us that these receipts will be forthcomingin the early part  of the financial  year, the Vote on Account to be taken this monthmust obviously be put  at a liberal figure.    4. Apart from this 82 millions, the 134 millions named above is divided as follows :     (a.) Cost in 1920-21 of the pre-war establishment,  55j millions.    (b.) Terminal expenses of the war, 30^ millions.    (c.) Extra charges due to temporary obligations, e.g., the Rhine,  Constantinople,or new liabilities such as Palestine, Mesopotamia and Persia;  total  48 millions.    (B20/90) 100  2/20  H&amp;S  7933wo
     The sum included  in  the 134 millions for &quot;new services,  i.e.,  new  schools of instruction,  capital  expenditure  on land  and  buildings  at  home or  in  the  newterritories, &amp;c., &amp;c., amounts to 1.1  millions,  viz., 4 millions under (a) and  7  millionsunder  (c).  The sanction of the  Treasury  will  be  sought for  the several  individual services under the ordinary peace rules in due course.     5. The 55-1 millions under (a) is less than the 62 millions representing the normal costof the pre-war numbers at present rates of pay and prices, because (1) in 1920-21 weshall be living  on existing stocks to  the extent of  5g millions, and (2) the  averagestrength of the Army Eeserve, Special Reserve and Territorial Force in  1920-21 will beless  than before the war.  Allowing for increases under these heads in a normal year,there might be some difficulty in  bringing the cost of the pre-war numbers down to 62millions,  in view  of the  increased  provision now made for educational  services andother matters relating to the welfare of the  troops, as well as for an  entirely new development such as tanks.     Provision is made for a Disposals  Corps,  as recently decided  by the Cabinet, toact under  the  direction  of the Ministry of Munitions in the  care  of surplus storespending  their disposal, but  to be administered  by the War Office; but  as credit istaken for the repayment of the cost by the Ministry of Munitions the net effect on the55^  millions is  nil.     6. The main items under (b) are payments (mainly for services already rendered) forland and sea transport, 13 millions ; moribund war-time  separation allowance, 5 millions ;liabilities  still outstanding to the  Ministry of Munitions,  4  millions; reinstatement ofproperty   taken  under  D.O.R.A.,  1^-  millions;  medals,  3  millions:  staff  andadministrative establishments  still engaged in clearing  up the  war or  re-creating thepeace regime ; maintenance of the war-wounded,  grave-diggers,  &amp;c.     7. The 48 millions under (c) is made up as follows :           (i.) The   Rhine   Garrison,  including  plebiscitary                troops   ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    5  millions.         (ii.)  Black Sea Force  ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    6^    ,,         (iii.) Force in Egypt, excess  cost over cost of  pre-war                garrison at present prices     ...     ...     ...    7     ,,         (iv.) Palestine   (including   1^ million  for  capital                expenditure)   ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    9     ,.         (v.) Mesopotamia (including 3 millions  for capital                expenditure)   ...     ...     ...     ...     ...   21^    ,,         (vi.) North-West Persia      ............    2f51fLess  cost of troops of these garrisons found out of  pre-war     numbers...    ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    3f                       Total of (c).........  48     No  provision is made for the expenses of the troops in East and South Persia,which the Government of India estimate at 8f millions in 1920-21.     8. In the hope  that the railways in Mesopotamia and Palestine,  both  as regardsconstruction and operating, will very shortly be transferred to the Civil Administration in Mesopotamia  from 1st April next, in Palestine as soon as  peace is made with turkey and a proper Civil Government is  established-provision is made in these estimates on  the basis of  payment out of Army funds for the  transport  of troops and military stores  at appropriate rates, and not  for any  further direct expenses of construction or operating ;  but it is believed that  the net total amount would not be greatly different whichever  basis were taken.     The sterling cost of all these forces, except (i), is continually  increasing, owing tothe rise in the exchange value of the rupee.   After consultation with  the Treasury the
    9. Generally, the Estimates for 1920-21 still include numerous charges representingthe aftermath of war, and such charges would be unaffected  by a reduction in thenumber of  troops provided for.   Roughly, every  10,000 troops reduced  from theaverage for the year would save  l  millions  (if white)  or 1  million (if native) in1920-21.   (These figures are less than the real  cost of the troops because of the extentto which  we are still living on  accumulated  stocks.)   In  case,  however, of  anywithdrawal from a whole territory, the saving would naturally be at a higher rate.  THE WAR OFFICE,       7 th February,  1920.value of the rupee is now taken in these Estimates at 2s. 6fi, as against Is. Ad. beforethe war.    The difference between these two rates represents no less than 13J? millions in the present Estimates.     Other elements which go to increase the cost of the Indian forces in the Near and middle East are (1)  the large dep6ts and  relief units which appear to be necessary inIndia to supply drafts and reinforcements, the cost of which is chargeable to Armyfunds, and (2) in the case of Mesopotamia, the large bodies of Indian and native labour employed.
