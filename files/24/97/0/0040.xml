This Document is the  Property  ofSECRET.His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Csovernment3205,From General Milne, Constantinople, to War Office.(No. G.C. 42.)                                               29th January, 1920.    Part 1.  Your No. 83403, M.O. 1, of 23rd  January, received (?) mutilated to-day.Franchet d&apos;Esperey&apos;s scheme is undoubtedly as much to organize the troops as to securehis (group undecipherable) position in  Constantinople.  The question of command  hasnow reached an acute stage which cannot continue.   In view of his interference m(?) control and overbearing  discourtesy neither Wilson nor  I  are  prepared to accept responsibility for maintaining order.   He now states that it is ridiculous that I shouldcommand French  troops  in Turkey  and  Europe  while there  are 20 battalions ascompared to 4 British battalions on the European side, further that  though  for thepresent Constantinople is under me all Allied  troops in Turkey in Europe are underhim.   This is an entirely new claim.   He further states that he will take over personalcommand and bring in such troops as he considers necessary in the  event of my sayingthat the troops at my disposal are insufficient.    Part 2.   ((?) This is) undoubtedly what he is aiming at.  It appears that he  haswritten to his Government and states that he asked General  Bridges to support him inEngland.  To me  General Bridges did not mention the matter.  He has  now issueddirect orders to the few French battalions under General. Willson&apos;s command, upsettingall  General  Willsorrs plans and  leaving at his immediate  disposal only two Frenchbattalions (one group undecipherable), he has contrary to  my wishes (?) ordered Britishtroops to be employed.  He has now under  his immediate orders all French  artillery.    Our position is not only humiliating, but the situation is impossible and a source of real danger, as (?) by preventing ((?)  Willson) using his French troops as he wishes,he is bound to to ask for others and will give Franchet  d&apos;Esperey the opportunity tointerfere which he  desires.    Part 3.  Serious trouble is bound to occur should Peace Conference decide to turnTurks out of Constantinople, leaving Greeks (?) in Smyrna and cut off all Armenia ;  andI shall be unable to control situation with troops at my disposal with my hands tied byFranchet d&apos;Esperey&apos;s  orders.  Were it not for  the  necessity for maintaining AnatolianRailway to feed Constantinople, I would withdraw troops from there and the Italiansfrom Konia.   The  Batum garrison would materially help, but its  withdrawal at  this moment might be regarded as a sign of weakness.   I am considering its reduction.    Three alternatives seem possible :     (a.) To insist on the recall of Franchet d&apos;Esperey who has now nothing to do but           interfere.    (b.) To withdraw all British troops from his command  and  leave him-to maintain           order in Turkish Thrace, exclusive of Constantinople (?) which British must           control.    (c.) To recall General Wilson and myself and leave Franchet d&apos;Esperey  in supreme           command, in which event (?) no good purpose  would be served by retaining           British troops.  I must request a very early decision.   The ignominious  and           dangerous situation created by the overbearing arrogance of one  man cannot           be allowed to continue.   I have purposely refrained  from answering his           letter until I receive a reply.(B14/348)  30  2/20  H&amp;S 7913-fTO
