January 30th, 1920.                                    Home Office,                                         Whitehall,  S.W.                                            30th January,  1920.Sear Sir Maurice Harikey,      A meeting of the Governing Body of the InternationalLabour Office was held in Paris on Monday, Tuesday,  andWednesday of this week.   At &apos;the close of the Wednesday sittingthe representative of the Polish Government submitted aproposal (of which notice haot not been given) that the Govern-ing Body should appoint a Commission to inquire into the labour conditions in Soviet Russia.  He urged that the present ignorance of those conditions was a great danger.  Large numbers of theworkers in other oountries believe that the Soviet regime had       ,-&apos;-r          V; pbrought about a new and better industrial order, and this beliefcontributed&quot; largely to the present state of unrest in the laboia?world.  He proposed that the Commission should include representatives both of the  employers and of labour, and, if theGovernment so desired, official representatives.   The proposal was strongly supported by Jouhoux.       In the course: of the  discussion which followed, StuartBunning pointed out that the proposal had a political side,(THIS  DOCtMMT  IS THE! PROPERTY Off HIS HRXTAKKtlC KAjgSTTg GQMMM.).
and suggested that the Council of tfto League of Nationsought to be approached.     X aslfced that a decision should not be taken on theproposal until tho next meeting of the Governing Body onMareh 22nd, pointing out that there had oeea no time forconsideration of the proposal and that 1 and other Govern-went representatives would feel it necessary to refer it toour Governments.     In the end it was decided not to take a decisionImmediately tint to instruct the Director, of, the Office, M*Albert Thomas, to make a report as to the feasibility ofthe proposal and m to a possible programme for theCommisaioa if it were appointed,   It was understood that  JJhomas would approach the authorities,&apos; he was disposedhimself to bring it before the -Council of. the Leaguebefore our next meeting. -        *                         .     If such an inquiry could be made, there seem very strong grounds, for allowing; it*   It is a question wf coursewhether the Soviet Government would allow the Commissionto see anything or hear anything they did not wish them ttsee or hear; but the supporters of the proposal seemedconfident that the facts could be got by a Oomaission ofthe character proposed*     IfU Albert Thomas will be coming in the course of afew days to London as the International Labour Qffiee willbe temporarily established in London until the League ofNations moves to Geneva or.wherever its seat is to be; and you may wish, to discuss the matter with him.  t shall beglrid eventually te have instructions as to the altitude I                                                   should
