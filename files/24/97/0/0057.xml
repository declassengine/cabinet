Extract from Report of Irish SuVCommlttee.             &quot;        (circulated fo*r  n B,rma tion j *           x      k      X      X      X      x      XllSH   4*   Clause 21 of tho Bill as drafted contemplates the ImperialHTRIBU-jON TO contribution for the first two years being fixed by the Joint BETA!PENDI- Exchequer Board on the basis of the actual contribution made by      Ireland in 1919/20.  Serious difficulty is found in formulating      the principles on which the Joint Exchequer Board is to make its      calculations,  inasmuch as arrears of Excess Profits JDuty, and      temporary expenditure arising out of the War have to be excluded,      while the yield of Excess Profits Duty in respeo t of the year,      has to be included, and allowance has to be made  for certain      future items of-expenditure.   The best solution  will be to state                                                            much      a definite  sum in&apos;  the Bill.  This sum should not  differ/from that      of  18,000,000 quoted by the Prime Minister.  As  the end of the      financial year approaches, many of the figures which were formerly      provisional can be revteu,  and a new estimate will be available      very shortly.   The  figure can be justified by calculations      presented to Parliament in a White Paper.IIIIII Mr 5.    Customs  duties on imported articles fall Into three classesIEXCISEps. according  to  the  treatment of the corresponding home product.          (1)   There may be no home product at all, or none worth     mentioning (as in the case of tea, sugar and tobacco).          (2)   The home product may be subjected to an excise duty     practically equivalent to the customs duty (as in the case of     spirits).          (3)   The home product may be subjected to an excise duty     materially less than the Customs duty, or to no duty at all (as  &apos;     in  the case of clocks, watches and musical instruments).mHI
     The first two classes of  duttec arc imposed for revenue onlyj  the third may he imposed for purposesof protection.   In considering whether power overExcise should be jiven to try  Irish Parliament, andwhether power over Customs should bo wholly or partlyreserved to the Imperial Parliament, different considerations apply to each of these several classesof Customs duties.   Logically it is no \ise giving an Irish Parliament power to imooso or vary &quot;xciseduties without the same power  over the corresoondingCustoms, Duties *   Logic apart, there are seriouspractical difficulties,   VTiere thore is no difference in duty between Great Fritain and Ireland,no such difficulties arise, but the essence of theproposal to grant Ireland control of excise dutiesis that differences in duty should be broivjht intooperation at the discretion of the Irish Parliament,r?here thero is such a difference, it-will discriminate against either the Irish producer, or the Britishproducer and the importer.   The former alternativemust be ruled out as impossible;  no Government wouldtax a home oroduct and leave it to compote r/itnuntaxed products from, elsewhere.   !&quot;ven in the case ofarticles the import of which from Groat Britain andfrom abroad are negligible Irish exporters would behandicapped by the duty.   Where tho Irish duty islower than the British, the effect in the case of anarticle, part of the supply of which is imported from great Britain or from abroad, would werol- be to givea certain amount of protection to tho Irish &quot;roducerjIt cannot bo assumed that this would bo tho policy ofthe Irish Government rather than rdvin,^ tho wholebenefit to tho consumer.   But, in the caso of an
 article which Ireland is in a position to export to Groat Britain,.the lowering of the Irish Fxciae Duty would he particularly objectionable,   British producers could migrate to Ireland much more easily than to foreign countries, and they mi^ht do so on a lar^e scale in order to5 produce for the British market at a lower rate of duty*   This would not only be an artificial displacement of industry, but it would also occasion a serious lose of Revenue to the Imperial Fxchequero      The upshot la. that there is no class of oases in which an alteration of exc?&amp;?$ duties can satisfactorily be allowed without a corresponding adjustment of Customs Duties *   But it does not follow that power over excise would be valueless to the Irish Parliament without the corresponding power over Customs*   It might be left to the Imperial Parlia- ment to make the necessary&apos;adjustments of Customs whenever the occasion arises*   Parliament legislates. every year to confirm the Customs resolutions of the Isle of Han, and It la possible that  it. would comply in the same spirit with requests made by the Irish Parliament in a matter which would really concern no one but the Irish Taxpayer (for ex hypothosi only revenue duties are  in question). On the other hand accute  controversy  might bo aroused the first time a differentiation between British and Irish duties is proposed, on the ground that a Customs barrier would have to be set up between Great Britain  and Ireland.,   Vovcomw it would be&apos; practically impossible  to got the resolutions of tho Irish and  Ii&apos;ipfParliaments to synchronise exactly,,   A possible  solution  on
these lines would be to give tho Imperial Governmentpower to make the necessary changes in Irish Customsduties by Order in Council for a limited period,,say, six months as from the first day after the,resolution on which the Imperial Parliament si ts;.If tho Imperial Parliament did not legislate beforethe end of that period the Order in Council rouldlapse, .,  This powor mi;;ht be specifically limitedto oases  in which the Irish Parliament had reducedan Txcise duty below the British level or had repealedsuch a duty.     Unless some such procedure as this were followed,It would be absolutely necessary to insert in the  bill clause, dealing with tho adjustment of customs &apos;duties and drawbacks, similar to that to which theChancellor of tho Txchequer recently raised objection.The clause as drafted was defective in that it didnot deal with foreign goods but only with goods Im-ported in Ireland from Great Britain and vice versa.Unless it is extended to cover foreign goods, it -will still bo necessary to roly on concurrentlegislation so far as they are:concerned.     If tho adjustment of Customs Duties anddrawbacks is made absolutely automatic, so that all goods entering Ireland, whether from Great Britainor from abroad, will be subject to so much duty asif they had been produced in Ireland and no more,then there is a danger that Ireland may exercise control over Customs duties on goods which arc notproduced in Ireland to any appreciable extent, by imposing excise duties,   Tho Irish Parliament might reduce the exc$ne duties on tobacco and sugar forthe sole purpose   &quot; ?&quot; ^1oi.,g the Customs duties upon
those articles*   They might even impose an Fxciaeduty on &quot;Irish grown tea&quot; In order to put an extraCustoms duty on imported tea.   But such measuredwould not really affect anyone but tho Irish taxpayer.They might indeed so reduce the yield of IrishCustoms as to diminish our security for the imperial contribution.   But even so wc should have tho powerto impose special taxes in order to recovor the contribution*   In fact, once the Customs barrierbejjffeen Groat Britain and Ireland is admitted, therela very little objection to be urged against any power over purely revenue duties being given toIreland.     The objection on the ground of policy to givingIreland control over Customs comes Into view when itis a question of protective tariffs.   Protectivetariffs affect the local distribution of trade andindustry, and create vested interests in theircontinuance.   A Federation is held together by a customs Union, because secession would mean newtariff walls, and would out off some of the tradersfrom their accustomed markets.   If on the other handa State is already cut up by tariff frontiers,division along those frontiers may take plaoe withoutoccasioning any immediate economic dislocation.Revenue Customs duties, accompanied by correspondingExcise  duties on tho home product, have neither thedisruptive nor the unifying effect.   Consequentlythere is something to be said for giving IrelandExcise duties with automatic adjustment of Customsduties and drawbacks, leaving Customs dutioa with aprotective effect under Imperial control;
     The real objection to this course is that oncoa partial control of Customs is &amp;lvon, it might hevery difficult to resist a claim for full control.Tho class of Customs duties v/hich are accompaniedby equal excise duties on tho homo product  (if thereis any) is easily definedj but once a Customs barrier-is sot up, and tho administrative machinery of customs Duties botrreen Groat Britain and Ireland Isat work, tho step towards&quot; complete control, includingcontrol of tariff poHoyj is a short one.   And as any differentiation of Excise duties practicallynecessitates the creation1 of a Customs barrier this argument tolls against the transfer of control even of rxcisc duties on commodities to Ireland*   Therearc in fact tiro conflicting policies.   On  the onehand the financial responsibility of Ireland willbe i&amp;ooinplote unless it Includes some pouer overthe taxes on oonmoditiea (which yield 60 per cent of the Irish revenue).   On the other, any  controlof Customs is likely to lead to control of  tariff policy.   To :;ive Ireland  control either of Trxisoduties and the corresponding oustoms or of  allrevenue customs duties, but not of protective ftutios, would   bo a defensible middle course, but it mi Jitnot be possible to maintain  these limitationspermanen.ly.              x     x     x     :cWhitehall Gardens,  8,^.,      Slat January,19Sfc
