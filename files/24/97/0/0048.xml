 MY....Mrag and Members of the Hojaue of Commons^                 *? .5 0      Tho war disturbed ana dislocated to its  foundations the economy of tho national life  end the transition  from war to peace has  been a difficult and at times a  Cancerous process.    I believe that  my oountry and.my Empire are making rapid strides towards the  restoration-of normal conditions.    The  Oomparison of the  prices of food in Great  Britain and  abroad,  and. the condition of trade with the  outside  world,  especially-of  the  export trade, serve. to prove that my people are  proving no less successful in weathering the  afterstorms of  reconstruction than they have bee-&apos;.! in enduring tho  ordeal  of war.     If, however, we are to  ensure lasting progress, prosperity and social peace, all  olasses  of my people must continue to  throw  themselves into the work of reconstructionwith good will for  others, with energy and. with patience,and legislation providing for 15arr?e and far-reaching measures                                     1 of reform must be passed into law.     First amonr? the measures which will be laid before youwill be a Bill to give effect to  the proposals for tho bettergovernment of Ireland outlined at the end of the last session.     Next comes the&apos;necessity for settling on an enduringbasis the difficult problems that have arisen in connectionwith the coalmining industry.   Theso problems rill d.emandyour early and anxious attention.   In addition to an emergency measure to adjust the financial arrangements ofthe collieries to mee&apos;^ the abnormal eoonomic conditions at present prevailing in the industry, you will be askedto consider proposals for the oo-ordlnatet,exercise bya Ministry of Uinee of t%-e duties and, powers alreadyentrusted to the Executive and. for the acquisition ofcoal royalties by the state and the future ord. rin-: oftho industry  in the bost interests of tho community as awhole.
                                        you         Bills  v/ill  also be  placed  before/for  the betterment of the  health  of the  people and  dealing v/ith  the services administered by  the Poor Law Authorities, for Increasing the benefits and the weekly contributions  under the National Health  Insurance, and for improving the milk  supply  of the country.         Experience during the war  showed  clearly the injurlGJUi effects upon national  efficiency of the  excessive consumption of strong drink and  of the betterment  both In Health and  efficiency which followed appropriate  measures of regulation  and control.   The  wellbeing of  the nationclearly  requires  that  all the former facilities for over- indulgence and abuse  should not  be restored,  and a Bill will accordingly be laid before you,  providing for the  development of a suitable  system for the peace time regulation of the sale and supply of alcoholic liquor.         Despite the Increase of agricultural  production during the war the population of these islands are still dangerously dependent upon the supplies of  food from Overseas and the financial burden of purchasing such supplies in foreign markets against an adverse rate of  exchange  is  very $ $at.
