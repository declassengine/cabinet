SECRET^l^^iiffifflj 13 the Property of      I&quot;9 9 9-(Home Office)Special Report No. 14                           Scotland House,  3.W.1,                               End February, 1920.       (Circulated &quot;by  the Home Seoretary)REVOLUTIONARIES AND THS NEED FOR LEGISLATION     English opinion appears to be divided between those whofear Bolshevism too much and those who fear it too little.There is no worse way of meeting a danger than to enter the fight trembling in one1s shoes except, perhaps, that ofascribing the noises in the basement to the wind and pullingthe sheet over one&apos;s head.  During their two years of power the Bolsheviks have achieved a great deal:  they nearly causedrevolutions in Switzerland and Holland on Armistice Day; theydid cause a short-lived revolution in Winnipeg; they held fora tiase the Capital of Bavaria, and for some months Hungary wasin their power.  They are raising Central Asia against Europeans,they are training  emissaries for India, and they are in correspondence with the extreme party among the Sinn Feiners inIreland,  All this they have done,in  two short&apos;years, not by force of arms but  by the  far   cheaper and more effective methodof underground propaganda.  That their doctrines have not takenwide hold in-England, France,  or the  United States is owing notonly to  the good sense of the  people  and the national stability of their institutions, but rather to the difficulty in sendingpropagandists and literature while the blockade continued.     It is rather remarkable that, with the danger before oureyes, with the example of the special Anti-RevolutionaryLegislation found necessary in Canada and the Unitod States,&apos;itis still not illegal in England to advocate the abolition ofParliament and the setting up of Soviet Government, to.circulateBolshevik literature, to accept money from abroad for                                              revolutionary/
: :revolutionary agitation, and to be a secret representative offthe Russian Soviet Government, provided that one does notadvocate acts of violence or armed rebellion; at least if itis technically illegal there is no risk of prosecution/ Theanomaly is more striking when it is remembered that the Sovieauthorities openly advocate and commit aots which are ordinar-crimes in this country.  Putting aside the murders perpetrate!!&quot;by the&apos;&quot;Extraordinary Commission,&quot; they advocate the de3truotof the capitalistic system by a wide circulation of forgednotes.  When the &quot;White&quot; troops entered Odessa they seized a Ihuge number of Bank of England  5 and Treasury  1 notes; in obundle alpne there were 20,000 forged  5 notes, of whichspecimens are now in the Bank of England.  This is part oftheir declared plan to destroy the value of money and soabolish capitalism.  The Soviet Government is, therefore,accessory to a crime punishable by penal servitude in England-;On October 9th, 1919 - three days after the settloment of WT\railway strike - the Soviet Government -Wireless transmitted ;message, put into the mouth of the railwaymen of &quot;Red Petrog:           &quot;British railwaymen you have declared a general      &quot;strike, but this is not enough........... You must      &quot;pass from a general strike to an armed rising,&quot;-     The senders of this message individually would be Hawto prosecution an England, yet without legislation we shall!be allowing their emissaries to enter this country and put jinto force their declared oriminal intentions with entireimpunity.  It is true that up to a few months ago there werjprovisions in the Defence of the Realm Regulations under v/han offender,might have been prosecuted summarily, but these regulations will shortly lapse and when trade intercourse TRussia is resumed the opportunity which the Bolsheviks havebeen waiting for will have come.  The stronghold of theBourgeoisie, as they regard England, will be open to them,                                                      who/
- 3 -9 9 9d ci d who shall aay that the steady stream of Bolshevik agitators working upon the minds of immature youths will not result some day in a catastrophe.  The experience of Russia and Hungary shows that it would not take much to  reduce civilisation to the chaos that followed the fall of the Roman Empire.      The legislation of the United States.is  probably more drastic than would be necessary in this country, where/experience has shown agitators to  be very much afraid of short terms of imprisonment,, and where, aots of violence and sabotage are almost.unknown.  Probably a restriction against importing, printing and circulating documents, advocating revolution and making inflammatory speeches, enforced summarily with comparatively mild penalties would be quite enough.      At the moment the position of the violent revolutionaries in England may b&amp; described in the words used by Edmund Burke of the same sort of body that flourished in 1790:           &quot;Because half a dozen grasshoppers  under a fern      make the field ring with their importunate chink,      whilst thousands of great cattle, reposed beneath      the shadow of the British oak, anew &quot;the  cud and are      silent, pray do not imagine that those who make the      noise are the onlyuinhabitants of the field; that      of course they are many in number,, or that, after      all, they are other than the little shrivelled,      meagre, hopping, though loud and troublesome insects      of the hourflu But this will not last.  Even the &quot;great cattle&quot; may become restless when the gadfly stings them, and the stock-breeder who sat helplessly by would deserve the ruin in which he would be involved.      Ever since Edmund Burkers day, and before, we have had  our home-grown revolutionary.  At ono time we know him as pro- Eonaparte, at another pro-Communard;&apos; then as  pro-Boer, pro-Indian, pro-Egyptian, and later as pro-German, in fact as pro anybody by&apos; whom it could be shown that his country wa3 in the wrong.  In moments of crisis you will find him as passive register,                                                 conscientious/
conscientious objector  or pacifist.   The  aarae  persons  are found in all these movements,  and  it  is natural  now to findthem conspiring secretly with  the  Soviet  Government in Russia,But &quot;besides those there is a secret international organisationdirected and subsidised by Lenin*s Government  for the  directpurpose of using the  local homo-grown revolutionary as an instrument for overturning the State.  A  Bolshovik propagandijagent who recently made a confession  at Reval, declared thatit was not the intention of the  Soviet Government to oarryarmed invasion into Europe, but  rather to  use  the Russianfrontier as a jumping-off place  for an army  of propagandists.!     At the beginning of last  year there  was definite information that the  Comraunists  in the United  States had greatdifficulty in communicating  with those in England and FranoJand they were so much out of touch with Russia that they hadnot received copies of  the original decrees  of the Soviet   government.  Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, who had  founded the    !&quot;People1s Russian Information  Bureau,&quot; was sending as  muchliterature to Messrs&apos;. Durant and Eellock,  of the lew York&quot;Call&quot; as she could,-by using  as couriers  seamen embarkingat Liverpoolo  At that  time she was   feeding her Bureau with Iinformation obtained  out of Russian newspapers through theRussian Jew, Theodore Rothstein, who  was  then  employed inM.I.7. branch of the  War Office.  Mr, George Lansbury  wasalso drawing upon Rothstein through Sylvia Pankhurst for itejof information about Russia for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.  Themovement rapidly became international.  Ludwig Martens,  aGerman Jew, was the Bolshevik  representative in  the UnitedStates, and.in May the  information he received from England!led him to state openly that England  wculd be  the nest Sovi^lRepublic.  He was corresponding with  Miss  Pankhurst, in Loifjand with M. Jean Longuet and Raymond  Pericat in  France,  andhe was also trying to arrange  for bail for the Bolshevik,Peter Simianoff, in Sydney.  It is believed  that when                                                   Litvinotf!
                            -5 -                          334Litvinoff left for Russia he appointed Theodore Rothstein torepresent him, &quot;but Rothstein had a competitor in SylviaPenkhurst, whose restless activity appears to have impressedthe continental Bolsheviks to such effect that she was invitedto attend the International Congress in Moscow at the &quot;beginningof 1919.  un invitation that she would gladly have accepted if she could.     On the 3rd April, 1919, a messenger arrived in London from the United States carrying credentials from the industrial workers of the World and certain papers from the AmericanCommunists which were to be handed over to Sylvia Pankhurstor one of the other extremists.  There is always greatcompetition when such an emissary arrives.  All the competingextremist leaders set upon him like flios and this messengerwas beset for days by an importunate crowd which included Mr.Lansbury and hi3 assistants, Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, TheodoreRothstein, 3elda Eahn and Albert Inkpin.  Miss Pankhurst. wasshort of money.  She had, it is true, received  830 from Stockholm, she was receiving a small weekly sum from Rothstein,and she is believed to have received little short of  1,000after hor trip into Switzerland and Germany two months age.     Meanwhile, Boris Souvorine, confidential secretary toJean Longuet, and a member of the staff of the &quot;Populaire&quot;,became the official representative of the Soviet Republic in france.  He was associated with a man called Deslinieres, who came to London about the middle of the  year to see Rothsteinand to communicate to him the results cf his conference withLit.vi.noff and Ycrorsky, the Bolshevik representative at stockholm.  He is be3ieved to have reoeived from Rcthstein asum of money to help in the formation of a Soviet group in france, and plans were made for getting into touch with the communists in Buda Pesth, with a v^ew to quicker communicationwith Russia.     In June, 1919, an American named Mendel Schaenen  arrived                                                        from/
from America with a quantity of revolutionary literature forSylvia Pankhurst.  At this time Rothstein was paying two agents in England and was sending money to the Sinn Fein extremistsfor fomenting disorders in Ireland.  He was also paying the wageof two agents employed by Sylvia Pankhurst, and contributed  10a week towards the expenses of the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;.  At thisperiod he was believed to have received  9,000.  It is alsoknown that the Italian Eolshevik group had officially appealed to Theodore Rothstein for money.     Rothstein1s communications with Litvinoff and Tchitcherineare sent in code, but his courier service, conducted by meansof seamen, is infrequent and irregular.  When in London heresides at his mother1s house at 53, Whitehall Park, Highgate,but he also occupies a converted Pullman car at Tophill,Windermere, to which he goes in the summer.,  His son, aBrackenbury Scholar at Balliol College, Oxford, assists him,and he also draws upon Albert Inkpin and a woman named Zeldafyahn, or Coate3-Eahn, for help.  Among the remittances receivedby Rothstein from Russia was a packet of diamonds.  Some ofthese now adorn the persons of Mrs. Rothstein and her daughter,but the rest have been converted into money,  Rutgers, Secreta.,of the Western Bureau in Holland, also received a quantity ofdiamonds to be used for propaganda.  Besides the Bolshevikcode, of which the Authorities possess a copy, Rothstein hasa pass-word, which is confidod to very few persons, such asZelda Eahn, Albert Inkpin, Ered Willis, of the. BritishSocialist Party, and possibly George Peet, of the &quot;Hands OffRussia&quot; Committee, and one or two others.  .     In the autumn of last year dissensions began to break outamong the Communist leaders owing to each claiming to be theofficial representative of Lenin.  Thus, in America a majorityvoted against Ludwig Martens continuing to be a member of theParty, and in England a rift began to form, between Rothstein                                                       and/
and SylTia Pankhurst.  These differences became important inview of a projected mooting of the adherents of tho ThirdInternational.THE? THIRD IHTOI1ATI0HA.S        The accepted principles of the Third International are   as follows:        1,   The overthrow of Capitalism.        2,   The abolition of tho Parliamentary and Local             Government systems and the substitution of             Soviets.        3.   The Dictatorship of the workers during the             state of transition from Capitalism to             Communism.        4.   The socialisation of land and industries.        5.   Enforced work by every member of the             community and a guarantee of food.        6.   Equal remuneration for all workers; free             education and maintenance for students.        7.   Self-determination of peoples by referendum.        0.   Disarmament of the bourgeoisie, in all countries,             and the arming of the workers&apos; to defend             Communism until Capitalism has disappeared,             when armaments will no longer be necessary.        9*   Abolition of all racial distinctions.     10.   A World Federation of Communist Republics.      The following bodies in England claim to be affiliated to the Third International:           The Workers1 Socialist Federation.           Tho British Socialist Party.           The British Industrial Workers of the World.           The South &quot;Wales Socialist Society.           The Clyde Workers1 Committee.           The London Workers1 Committee.           The Scottish section of  the  Independent                       Labour Party, and members of  the Extreme  Left of the English  Independent Labour Party.      In  June, 1919, the  Treasurer, H.: Alexander, and  the leader,  E,C. Pairchild,  of  the British Socialist party, resigned because  the ideas  of tho  rank and file had become                                                       too/
too extreme for them.   Among  the  extremists  are  a few of  whatthe Americans call &quot;Parlour Bolsheviks&quot;,  such as  CharlesTrevelyan and Eoden Burton, hut  they are  not  taken into theconfidence of the aecret organisers.   The leaders who  have a                                                             cknowledge of what is going on  are  professed Bolsheviks suchas Tom Mann, Secretary to the  Amalgamated Society of Engineers,Arthur McManus, David Ramsey,  William  Gallacher,  Miss  floraSmythe, Zelda Coates-Kahn, Albert  Inkpin,  W.  Paul and  FredWillis.  The Labour leaders who  play with the idea of  Revoluticibut are afraid to descend from the fence  are  Robert Williams,Robert Smillie, Arthur Cramp anc George Lansbury,THE SECRET MEETING OF THE THIRD IflTERNATIQNAL IN HOLLAND        In December, 1919, there arrived in England a Jew named   Fraina, with a false passport and under an assumed name beceiisl   he Was &quot;wanted&quot; by the New York Police in connection with his   Bolshevik activities.  Fraina had been sent over by the   Communist Party opposed to Martens to attend a secret meeting   of the Third International which was to be convonod either in!   Occupied Germany or some other suitable place.  For this   purpose the deportees were to assemble in Holland.  Fraina   actually left England for Holland in January, carrying letter]   for the Continental Bolsheviks, and planning, if possible,   reach Moscow and persuade Lenin to dismiss his rival Marteiuj   A day or two later Fred Willis, from Glasgow, and Sylvia   Pankhurst followed.  They were received in Amsterdam by   S. Rutgers, who had been appointed by Lenin as organiser for   Western Europe.        Willis obtained a passport by representing himself to   be travelling for Messrs. Schaerer, Surgical Instrument Mail   This  firm is owned entirely by aliens of German name but Sn   nationality, and the London Manager is Albert Edward KehrM   the brother of Kefcrhahn who escaped from internment.  He is   of German descent.   Arthur McManus, the Clyde deportee,  apjj   for a passport as traveller for Messrs. Lester Ltd., a                                                     Manches&apos;
H 9 &quot;to n nManchester firm of warehousemen.  This firm is managed &quot;byrillidm Richard Stoker, of &quot;Greonmoro&quot;, St, Albans Road,Halifax, who is a conscientious objector  and is believed to have concealed the notorious W, Paul from arrest.  the certificate was signed by Dr, Chandlor, v/ho is woll knownfor his revolutionary opinions.  It is to be feared, however that as both firms are genuine businesses it would bedifficult to prosecute any of the persons concerned inthis conspiracy for making a false declaration.     Rutgers1 claim to be the sole representative of Leninfor Vfostero Europe is not undisputed, for Lenin has alsoa secret emissary in Germany, unknown to the GermanGovernment, named Reich, who also passes under the name ofJames,  It was finally agreed that Rutgers should surrender to Reich the whole of German territory,  With Rutgers wereRoland Hoist, Ravenstein, Wynkoop, Pennikoop and Horst,who wore jointly to form a &quot;Western Europe Bureau&quot;.  Atthis meeting it was decided that the Conference 3hould be                                4held during 1&apos;cbruary in Holland, and letters were at oncedespatched to Lenin1s representatives in Prance, Spain,Italy and Mexico, telling them to leave for Hollandabout the 1st February,  The Treasurer and Archive keeperfor this Bureau is W, L, Brusse, of 172a, Bersingel,Rotterdam, who is also engaged in obtaining passages forSoviet messengers under false credentials.     Prom a report by tho Hungarian Commandor-in-Chief,          *Buda Pesth, it appears that a Central Enrope InternationalBureau has been established in Vienna, under the title&quot;The South-Wost Commission of the Third Internationalacting in Vienna&quot;,  About the middle of December, a                                           Commission/
Commission arrived from Moscow and formed a confederation of the Communists of Austria, Germany, Czeoho-Slovakia,Hungary, Roumania, Italy, Poland and the Ukraino, with theplan of creating, Bolshevik revolutions in March in Poland,Austria, Czechoslovakia and Italy, and cutting off Hungary,Roumania and Bulgaria from the Entente 0  At tho same  timethe Red Army, led by German officers, was to undertake an offensive on the Russian Y/estern Iront.     The corresponding members in the various countries wersCicotto, Serrati and Schweide for Italy; Bronzki, ClaraZetkin, Kagan and a man named Gordon for Germany; SylviaPankhurst for England; Brost, probably Brusse, for holland and Denmark; Franck for Austria; Alpari for Hungary.  Withsomo of those Sylvia Pankliurst is known to be in touch.     The same report states that Lenin deposited 50 millions of roubles in Berlin in November, 1919, for the use of hiavarious agencies.  One of the activities of this organisation was the plot to blow up the Army Headquarters and the PrimeMinisters house in Buda Pesth, and to re-establish a Soviet]regime in Hungary,     The object of the British delegates is to obtain a mandate for the formation in England of a united CommunistParty.  On January 24th a meeting was held in London withthis object, when it was announced that, a ballot of theSocialist Labour Party had resulted in a majority againstthe proposal.  The terms of the ballot were as follows:                     &quot;REFERENDUM ON                      SOCIALIST UNITY.          Are you in favour of the amalgamation&apos;of the B.     with the S.L.Pr.-, WBS.rF0, and S. Wales &amp;.S., and  the     formation of a New United Communist Party on the     following basis:          (a)  The Dictatorship of the Proletariat,          (b)  The Soviet System          (c)  The Third International,          (d)  A referendum of the proposed new Party&apos; to                  taken three months after its formation                  the Question of affiliation to the                  Party?&quot;                                                  and/
and the proposal was defeated, apparently, on account of question (d).  It was then decided to ash the ThirdInternational to send a representative to the noxt meeting,with power to make an authoritative statement.     During the socret meeting in Holland the difforencesbetween the English extrome leaders becamo very apparent.Sylvia Pankhurst distrusts Rothstein;  Rothstein has acontempt for Sylvia Pankhurst:s intelligence and discretion.But the real division is between those v/ho favour using theCommunist Party in Parliamentary elections and those who,like Sylvia Pankhurst, will have nothing to do withParliament at all.  Lenin has been kept accurately informed of these differences, end in  a letter to an English supporter which was quoted in one of, my rooont reports, he 3ays thathe would favour a Communist Party in Parliament  ( for thoconversion of the other Parties) and a Communist Partyoutside- working in collaboration with it.  ;,     It may be said that there is too much of the theatricalcloak and dagger about those  secret meetings to be a roalmenace; that the advocatos of violent revolution have failedto prodiice a real loader, that their activities invariablyproduce jealousy and rivalry, and that all their energiesare expended in an internecine quarrel among themselves.That would bo true if  thoy were cut off from communicationwiti Russia, but during tho last two years Lenin has shownhis capacity for composing such quarrels, and his prostigewill be sufficient not only for dictating a policy which all will accept, but for infusing into tho movement  an energyunder which it must spread.   He will also water  the youngplant with a stream of money,, without which experience hasshown it would wither  away*   Tho British delegates will                                                 return/
return some time during February armed with funds,literature and inspiration. Wherever they find discontent among the rank and file, with whom they are closely intouch, they will inflame the sore.  It may he possiblo touse some of the unofficial agencies for combating Bolshevikto expose the conspiracy,and turn it into ridicule; tofollow the conspirators about and question them at theirown meetings - in fact, to use publicity which is now theonly weapon.  But if Bagland were to follow the example    Isot to it by the United States, Canada, and other countries who have foreseen and provided against the danger by legislation, the^risk womld be very greatly diminished.    J     A draft of suggested legislation is appended,  The    Iproposals are far less drastic than those that have alreadypassed the  Senate in the United States, but even in theirpresent form they will of course meet with opposition inthe House of Commons,  The members from whon  such oppositiis to be expected are those who advocate the recognitionof the Soviet Government.  Sooner or later, unless somequite unforeseen event occurs in Russia, thore will have tobe intercourse and &amp;ven some form of recognition, and it   Jmight facilitate the passing of tho Bill if it woreunderstood that until such legislation is passod  thequestion of recognition oannot be considered.
