CABINET.              COAX FOB ITALY *Memorandum by M*        handed to the PrimeMinister at Clarldgers Hotel, Parts, on                         January 18^X920*       HJhe economic reconstruction, which Italy-is strenuously endeavouring to accomplish, la strictly connected with one fundamental problem - 0oaU       This question includes two elements    quantity and&apos; price *       1*  The minimum quantity indispensable to the needs of the country required from Great Britain is half a million tons per month, without which the country will be orippled.   With   * anything short of the full quantity it will be impossible ts run sufficient trains and the distribution of food and rawmaterials will tee Imperilled?  moreover, industrial production. will be dangerously1 reduced.  &apos;  TAB 600,000 tona per month which Italy is asking of Gveat Britain represented &amp; minimum when Italy was receiving coal alst from America, Germany, francs and Belgium.  How, her source of supply is practically confined to Oreat Britain, and any diminution of  the 500,000 tona has, for^Ital/s more faxwrefeohing consequences than for any other country, which, as in the case of Prance, in addition to their own output are importing ooal from various souroegt       2*  At the present price ooal costs, in Italy, 450 lire p9r tea, r ^             iW **** o, *. moat 98B9ntiaa, will not be able to pay such piles, whloh will result in their ultimate stoppage *SBCRBI
        &quot;Moreover, as a result of the British coal policy, there  exists a difference between British and Italian prices of about  180/- per ton, so that piUes in Italy are actually four times.  or, if the depreciation in the exchange is taken into account,  eight times higher than in Great Britain.        The result is that the equilibrium  existing, previous&apos;to  the War, between the cost of production in Great Britain and  Italy, is practically broken, especially in those industries  which are the larger consumers of ooal, so that production will  not be possible in Italy at a cost within $he limits of market  prices.  It is necessary to consider that it is impossible in  Italy to correot the British prices with those of cheaper coal,  as happens, for example, In France and Belgium which have their  own output and full priority on the German coal.        Italy is therefore in an absolute inferiority even in com-  parison with the other Allies, as In Italy the British--export  price, increased by the enormous loss on the exchange and by the \  freight, represents the general current price.        3.  Therefore both the question of export from Great Britain  and that of tho British export prices aro principally an Italian  problem.  If the present level of prices oannot be reduced, the  only alternative f6r Italy will be, either to stop a large part  &apos;  of Italian industries, with decrease in production and consequent  unemployment and social unrest, or to find a new system of  Customs duties to remedy such a dangerous and artificial situation.  The Italian Government is fully aware of the danger of both.the  solutions.  He is therefore confident that, at this critical  moment of the reoonstx-uction of the country, which is also  necessary in the general interests of Europe, the British Govern-  ment will, by somo temporary measure, rectify such an abnormal  and dangerous position and provide Italy with one of the stapla  elements1of life.                               m *m m *&quot; ***PARIS,   January 18,  1920.
