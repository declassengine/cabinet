TV., sx^rncrrt is the  Property ofMilitary Secret.                  1284              From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,                                   Zrd J-atniarti 1920.ALLG^^                         (Received 4th.)         1442.   Malleson wires 30th January:          &quot; Bokhara.  In a letter to Amir of Bokhara I asked him to give me his views on     Afghan activities in Turkestan and whether they had his approval.   In  a letter dated     7th January just received, Amir writes : &apos;In our opinion the coming of &quot;Afghans to     Bokhara and Turkestan is solely for bringing Turkestan Mohammedans together and     for establishing relations with Bokhara, and their object is to take action against     Bolsheviks when their time comes.&apos;         &quot; 2. I should interpret this as  meaning that, apart from their respective under-     standings with Bolsheviks, Afghanistan and Bokhara are arranging  some sort of     reinsurance agreement, should Bolsheviks play  either false.   I  do not think that     Bokhara would ever aid or encourage Afghanistan  in any purely anti-British design,     but that he is  chiefly concerned with preserving integrity of  his  dominions, and if     possible securing complete independence and restitution of  territory annexed  by     Russia.&quot;
