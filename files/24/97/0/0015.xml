(a)   KMA1S10B*I.-   HHMCES OF THE 00A  KINWG INDUSTRY..           April, 1919 to August, 1980.        Under the War Emergency tos (Continuance) Bill, theDefence of the Realm Begulationa under which the ooal finingindustry Is at present iSo&amp;trclled will continue until the 31stAugust aext - apart from any further legislation which theGovernment may undertafce in regard to mining.        She period for whic&amp; financial provision requires to be made may therefore bo divided into two portionst-     (a)  3!he financial year from 1st April 1919 to                  31st March 1920t     (h)  the five months from 1st April 1920 to                  31st August 1920.        dt far as the year 1st April 1919 to 31st March 1920is concerned, the finances of the industry have alreadybeen adjusted on such a hasia that it is not possifclo to                                               make
make any reduction in prices beyond thoso already mado inhousehold coal and coastwiso bunkers.      ,  Independent Accountants who are examining theestimates of the Coal Minos Department have completed theirenquiries and their report should be availablo very shortly.        The estimates which Mr. Prank Hodges has publishedcover a year from July to July which is not a financialyear and his estimates are therefore not a guide, even ifthey were oorrect, and that is not admitted.        As soon as the Independent Accountants1 report is received, estimates will be prepared in respect of theperiod from 1st April, 1920 to 31st August 1920.  Provisionalestimates have already been made but tkti*B? will require tobe checked in the light of their report.        It is expected that in the period from 1st April, 1920to 31st August 1920 the profit yield will be at a higher rate than during the twelve months ending 31st March, 1920, andit will be a matter for the Government to consider how thisprofit is to bo disposed of.  In their consideration, therepresentatives of the Miners&apos; Federation will certainly bekept in mind.        *1 *  OPAL mrSRS1 PROFITS, 1919-1920.        The profits of the industry for the financial year1919/1920 are, after deduction of allowance for increasedcapital, estimated to bo  22,000,000.        Under the Agreement the owners would be entitled toperhaps  6,000,000 more.
(3)Since, howsvor, the 10/- reduction in the price of      household coal was made  on the  basis  that the  Agreement      would  not operate during this  financial year,  and  since  also      the effect of the Agreement would be  to give  high  profits  to      exporting firms and  leave many inland firms  to have  their      guaranteed standard  made up from Exchequer Funds,  the      Government has decided that new legislation is necessary and      that profits must be not only restricted but  equitably      distributed.(4)            Since the pre-war standards of the industry -  under      the provisions of the Finance Aet ** amount to round about       32,000,000 it is apparent that the profits of the financial      year will just square accounts.(5)            The profits  for the period 1st April, 1920 to  31st      August, 1920 ar-e provisionally estimated to be  22,000,000      for the five months.

     This percentage increase  of 129 may be analysed as follows                    due to increased standard rates    58.4;.                    due to r:ar wago.                   42.4.                    due- to Sankcy wage .                28.2;.&apos;                                            Total      129.

              (c)   EXPORTS.          TOE PORFIGH g IN&apos; COAL.     The quantity of coal exported In the yoar 1919was 35,260,000 tons, (not including bunkers),    hisquantity represented 15 per cent of the estimatedoutput of coal from mines in 1919, and compares rrlth25 per cent similarly exported immediately prior tothe &quot;ar.     The value of the coal shipped in 1919, exclusivepf Bunkers, &amp;o. was  83,214,000, or 10.4 per cent of thetotal value of the goods of British or Irish originexpovtocU   The money value of the proportion soescorted in yoars 1908 to 1913 varies from 8,0 per cent to 10.5 per cent.     Four-fifths of the ooal exported, apart from bunkers,etc * was shipped at British Channel and Horth Fast coast ports in 1919;  and cloven-twelfths of this coal was sent                                                         i                                                         to European Countries and others fringing the Mediterranean.The quantities of coal shipped in the years 1913 rnd 1919,respectively, arc as follows       ports                1913               1919                            tons               tons               (a) Ports from whence coal was shipped.,,Bristol Channel          89,876,000       20,289,000Horth Western               752,000           86,000North Tastom            23,024.,000       11,702,000Humhcr Ports              8,883,000          531,000Scotland                 10,437,000        2,651,000All other ports             428,000           51,000

The particulars relating to the year 1919 arc provisional             only and subject to revision.   Shipments to the Russian             Ports on the Baltic Sea are included with those to             countries round the North Sea;  but those to the ports             on the Northern ooast of Prance are included in the             rest of Europe.4.        The Mediterranean., Spanish and Pronoh Bay shipments are     important from the point of view of return cargoes of iron ore,     and amongst other European Countries.   Supplies of coal have had     to be given to Sweden owing to the importance of securing return     cargoes of timber in connection with the housing.proposals.  The     South American shipments are extremely important from the point     of view of eheapening imports of food from the Argentine.  To     send out ships light is onl^r to increase the oost of the oargo     they bring tact.6.        The total known production of coal in the world In the -ye^r    - 1912 amounted to 1,100 million tons.exclusive cf brown coal or     lignite.   Of this quantity 950 million tons were contributed by     the United States -nf,America,, the United Kingdom and by Germany     and France.   The quantity of coal produced in the year 1919 by     these countries may be reokonad provisionally as nearly 775     million tons, or 175 million tons less than in 19X2.  Limitation     of the quantity of coal exported from this country, therefore,     aggravates the shortage in other countries and reacts on us by     a further increase in value and in the cost of commodities Im-     ported into the United Kingdom.
     Further, while only t-o-thirds of the total British produc-tion of coal  (260 million tons) in tho year 1912 was availablefor homo consumption, more than threo-fourths of the output(230 million  tons) in 1919 use so  available.     The export of coal in tho year 1919 was at tho  average rateof nearly 3 million tons per monthj  for tho last 6 months of1919 it was at the average rate of 2 * million tons per month.     This QX^ort quantity is roally already much too low inview of the importance of our coal export as a medium of barterin our international trade and also because of tho dire stato offuropo and the pressure rfoich our Allies, Prance and Italy, are putting on us.   But in addition, it is extremely difficult to cut it down because of the pressure there is on the transportof the country.   TTe are gaining relief by means of coastwise shipping in increasing quantities, though sea transport is at aheavier cost  than rail transport.   Tlr Ministry of Transportarc at the same time devoting special attention to the expeditionof coal traffic - short of giving priority over other traffic.     The normal output of coal raised per- pers-cm-oTttploycd^the first half of the yoar 1919 amounted to 4$ tons per wock,and compares  with m average of  4 tons per week in the lattorhalf of the yoar, neglecting the period of tho Yorkshire di sputoand tho national strike of railwrymon.   In the districts ofEngland and &quot;^ales, except Yorkshire, from TJhich supplies ofcoal for inland consumption are chiefly dra-n and from rhencoadditional supplios could most easily bo transported, theoutput per person during tho first half of the year 1919 averaged   ^                          &quot;a 2over 4 tens per week and only  *3 tons per weok during thosecond half.   Somo allowance should, however, bo made forthe effect of tho railway strike.

(d)  SUPPLIEStMemorandum as to shortage of Inland Supplies.Exportation in relation to Inland Supplies.(1)Taking the three months ending 31st. December,1919,and comparing them with the three months ending 31st*December, 1918, the supplies both for Household andPublic Utility purposes were not short - for Kouseholdpurposes in the\three months the supplies for 1919 were15$ above those of 1918 (8$ above in the metropolitan area and 19$ above in the Provinces) and for PublicUtility Works they were 9$ up in 1919, [Z% metropolitan area and 12 J$ Provinces).     These increased supplies over the last three monthsof 1918 have only been obtained by the greatest efforts.     The difficulties that have arisen are due to **     Stocks are absent, or practically absent, owingto -     These two disturbances which came one upon theother depleted stocks at the very time when they shouldhave been maintained and increased to provide for theusual winter heavy consumption-     The position was realised at once and the Departmentwith the help of the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministryof Transport, has been making all efforts to replenishstocks and has succeeded a3 shewn above in increasing con-siderably the quantities brought forward over those in 1918*(a)  absence of stocks(o)  increase in consumption. (I)  the Yorkshire  Coal  Strike(ii)  the September  Railway Strike.
     Fiut side by side with this there has been a great increase in consumption. .  The consumption of Householdcoal has increased 20f over the last three months in 1918.(Metropolitan area 16$ increase and the Provinces 21%)while the consumption of Public Utility Works has Increasedby 7i% (Metropolitan area 15$,. Provinces 5i$)...  Theadditional supplies, therefore, have gone not into stock butinto consumption and even then the total consumption has exceeded the total supply.     It is to be remembered that the question is,.on thepresent production,, entirely one of transportation, and thepresent state of the railways and of shipping has preventedlarger supplies being moved. .     Whether the 10/- reduction of the price of Householdcoal actually diverted supplies from Household and public utilities to- other purposes, .and if so to what extent,&apos; .the evidence available does not show.     But the three chief factors In the present&apos;positionare -     (a)  Loss of stocks     (b)  Increased consumption     (c)  Difficulties of transport in the way of          securing a further Increase in supplies.EXPORTATION. -     It is&quot; to be noted that while. in 191,3 only two-thirds of the total production of coal was available for consumption in 1919 more than three quarters of the smaller output was brought Into home consumption^     Secondly,, exportation IS only&apos; permitted subjectto inland supplies being fully met. -  Control is de-centralised and is exercised by the Supplies Committees
acting through the executive officer of the Coal L&quot;.inoaDepartment at the shipping ports.   Foreign shipmentsarc, therefore, closely controlled &quot;by the local authority,which is itself directly responsible for home supplies.     But it must be remembered that the preferencewhich has boon and cohtinuos to bo given to inlandsupplies can only bo effective to tho extent to which railor soa transport is at the given moment available to takothe coal as it comes from tho Colliery.   Srom the shaftthe coal goes direct into tho trucks, the trucks must besent off, discharge-&apos;, and returned empty in order that the colliery may be kopt working;  if the supply of emptytrucks falls tho Colliery is thrown idlo*   It is thereforefalse economy and only re-acts injuriously on homo supplies to send coal inland by rail unless tho trucks can bepromptly dealt with and returned.   Again, if trucks arrivoat a port and find only foreign tonnage available fortheir discharge the coal must go abroad.   Trucks cannotwait nor can coal be otorcd until such timo as shipping is available to tako it to a British port.*     The problem is therefore chiefly one of movement -        (a) can wo move more coal by rail inland        (b) can re move more coal coastwise by sea           to British ports,      (b) is steadily being done with the help of theShipping Controller^ but when all i3 done in thisdirection that is possible, only a smcftl additional quantity will bo moyed, bpcauso soa carriage is and can boonly a small proportion of the total rail and sea coalcarriage of the country.     &quot;0 therefore come back to (a).   This is a question for tho Ilniotry of Transport, but apart from giving ageneral priority to coal over all other commodities,and/or some drastic improvement of transportation such
as common user of all railway nagons, that HInlstryappears to bo giving all tho help possible^Coal Mines Department,         Hotel Windsorp Scr.L              January 26th, 1920.
