We have not got either in Constantinople nor indeed at home,  any R.A.M.C.Poct^re and Nurses.  Would it be possible for the Red Cross,either British, Russian or Polish to help in organising campsfor the wounded and&apos;Rick and women and ohildren who may &quot;be ,shipped to the Crimea?           It is very difficult to give an estimate of theprobable numbers, but it may reach a total of fifteen or twentythousand.           The C.I.G.S. can give you all the information thatwe possess am this matter.                            Yours sincerely^Hen.Sir Arthur Stanley,6.3.15...        &amp;c*,  &amp;o.,  &amp;o.(Signed)  P.

Weshall be glad to do anything in our power to help  in organisingcamp3 for the wounded and sick Russians who may be ohippad  to the crimea, and I think that we oould find the necessary doctors and nurses, provided we could look to the Government  for payment ofthese and all other expenses.           During the past few months we  have distributed a sumof money amounting in all tb about  1,7 0,000 among the hospitals in London and the country as we felt that this was the best andquickest way of applying to the use of the men of  His  Majesty1eForces who had suffered in the war the money which had beengiven to uw for that purpose.  We have also distributed all ourstores and Ihe p*g&amp;ibi B* therefore, now is that we have no  storesavailable and only just sufficient money  for our own needs  inpeace time.  I am afraid, therefore, that it is impossible that  ;c could spend any money of our  own in this Russian work, and thevery poor result attained by an  appeal recently made by theBritish  Committee of the Russian Red Cross in England under ourauspices does not load me to hope that any money for the purpose is likely to be forthcoming from the public.           If the Government  is  prepared  to find the money i will proceed at once to get together the  requisite personnel andI think  I could he prepared te put  before you an estimate of the*oat within the ocurse of the present week.

Any figuresthat I can give you in this connection are really pure guesswork as one knows so little about the local conditions,  but asregards the personnel and pay you may take thorn as beingsubstantially correct.  As regards the feeding (for which youwill see I have put the sum of  2,000,000) this amount is pure
ocnjoction ae I do not know what food there may &quot;bo in thecountry, hut I have based the estimate on the supportyijnthat most of the food, if not ail, would nave to oe snippedfrom England.       Tho estimate dees not include any expenditure on tents&quot;buildings, etc. as about these I know nothing.       If you show this list to the Chancellor of theExchequer will you please make it quite clear that I do not put it forward in any way as a definite estimate but only ast* response to your request to me on the telephone.       An important factor about which, of course, I have no information  is the proportion of sick &apos;people that will haveto be dealt with out  of the five thousand.
