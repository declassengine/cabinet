THE RATING 03P TITHE KENT CHAHGl.        Memorandum by the Chanoellorof theExohejnxer.1*   On the 18th December last. I received a large and  repre-sentatlve deputation from the.Central Board of Finance  of theChurch of England in regard to the rating of tithe. .   The present position is that tithe is rateable in  full(a corresponding deduction being allowed from the rateable value of the land on which it is charged) but that under theTithe Rent Charge (Hates) Act, 1899, one half of the rates ontithe attached to a benefioe is met by the Commissioners? of inland Revenue from the share of the estate duty payable throughthe Local Taxation Account to county authorities.,3,   The deputation emphasised teo main points     (i)  that the present basis of ratihg of tithe is grossly     unfair:     (ii)  that  the harcshlp on Tithe-owners has been accentuated     by  the passing of tho T;ithe Act of 1918, which fixed the     value of  tithe until  1926 at its  value for 1919 ( 109),     thereby depriving Tithe-owners  of any benefit which they      might normally  obtain from  an  inorease  of tithe  while      nothing  was done t*  limit the  burden  in respect  of rates.4.    As regards the  tlrst point  it  must, I think, be  admitted&apos;that the present rating  system is  Inequitable in its operation,and  will require complete  revision in the  future,  but  there isn  class on which 3,t  imposes  greater burdens  than the  Tithe-owner,  especially the, clerical incumbents  and clerical       ^appropriaters, who  are bound  to  render services  as a canditianof receiving  the tithe.  On any  principle  of  &quot;ability  tepay&quot; or &quot;benefit received&quot; It is  difficult  to justifyrequiring a country vicar  with an income  of  200per  annum (wholly from  tithe) and a house  rated at                                               say
\say  30 per annum to pay rates in full on his house andat half-rate on his whole inoome.   With rates at 47-th e war) this represented a total oontribution of  26.On the cleridal appropriaters of tithe (the capitularbodies) and the lay impropriators (largely colleges *schools, hospitals, etcJ the burden is still heavier, asthey derive no benefit from the Aot of 1899.5,   As long as rates were fairly constant one could put forward the defence that they represented apermanent deduction from the value of the tithe, butthe position has been radically changed by the greatrise in rates, especially %n rural areas.   This is still continuing and by next year the average rate in rural areas may be 75$ over the pre-war average.6.   Had tithe been allowed to rise in value the inore-raent would have been more than enough to meet theincreased burden of rates and the question of altering the basis of rateability might well have been allowed to await  the general revision of local taxation.  The TitheAct, 1918 stopped the rise in value and has broughtmatters to a crisis.7.   The remedy suggested by the Central Board Of Finance,to Ibfo and its extension to capitular tithe.  They claimed that the Chapters, no less than the parochial Clergy,rendered services for the tithe they received.8,   Neither the Minister of Health nor I favour this in the   (approximately the average in rural areas beforerelief under the Act of 1899proposal
proposal.  The relief would not be given on any olear.ground of principle and the exclusion of the lay impro-priators who equally with the clergy made a considerablesacrifice of their legal rights in 1918 would be diffioultto defend.   Also the relief so given would come out of themoneys payable to the county authorities and I ratherfear that pressure from these bodies would lead to ademand for a direct State grant to the titheowning rate-payers - a most objectionable form of Government subsidy.9.   The proposal whioh I wish to lay before the Cabinet,and which I believe the Minister of Health would support,is for a limitation of the rates on all tithe, pendingthe general reform of the system of rating, to the ratespayable in 1918-19.  Thus the tithe-owner, having hadhis tithe stereotyped unli 1926 at the figure for 1919, wouldal30 have the oharges on it stereotyped for the same period(if reform is so long delayed).10.  If the Cabinet approve my proposal in principle i suggest that the Minister-of Health should be asked to under-take the necessary legislation.                         (Initialled)   A.G.TREASURY,  S.W.1.   4th February,  1920.
