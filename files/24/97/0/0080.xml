[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government&apos;.&apos;]CONFIDENTIAL.(11504.)POLITICAL  INTELLIGENCE  DEPARTMENT,              FOREIGN  OFFICE,ySCANDINAVIA/003.MEMORANDUMONSOCIAL  MOVEMENTS  IN SCANDINAVIA.    FOR some months now the pendulum in Scandinavia has been swinging away from  Extremism.   It is  inevitable, nowadays, that the &quot;Left&quot;  wing of socialmovements should be tinged more or less with Bolshevism (or Leninism), and  thedesire to adhere to the Third (or Moscow) International.  But it  is of  the first importance to note the strength and make-up of this impulse; and it is from this fact that the decisions of  the Scandinavian Labour  Congress derive their value.Only  15 votes out of 400 were cast for adhesion to the Third International.    To appreciate the just significance of this adverse vote it is necessary to bear inmind  that this  is the third occasion  within the last two months upon which  the extremists have been challenged.   The first occasion was the municipal elections in norway.  The Extremists had been for a year in control of the party organisation,funds, and newspaper.    They had not pressed their victory to the choice of theirown member  for the Storthing; but had voted for Majority Socialists.   When theydid attempt to assert themselves,  as in the attempted strikes on the anniversary ofthe  Bolshevik  revolution,   the  result  was  a fiasco.   They  therefore bore  theappearance of the unpardonable vice-ineptitude; and when the municipal electionstook place the consequences appeared.    In the rural districts, and even in centreswhere the Socialists had had a majority for years,  in Christiania, in Trondhjem,christians and, Stavanger, and Bergen, they suffered a heavy defeat.    The second occasion was the Congress of Scandinavian Socialists of the Left,which met in Stockholm  (8th-10th December).  It was computed that the Congressrepresented 300,000 Scandinavian workers, i.e., some  3 per cent, of the Scandinavianpopulation.    There were a number of revolutionary  speeches made.   Tranmcel (Norway) proposed a resolution calling upon the trade unions to &apos;&apos; create a workingbasis for the social  revolution.&quot;   Madsen  (Denmark) urged  the necessity  of solidarity among the proletariat of the world.   But these  heroics went off like  aI damp squib.   &quot; Why, if  the Norwegian Labour Party is so unanimous in this view, does it not raise a revolution in Norway instead of coming to  Sweden to talk aboutlit?&quot;  asked M. Severin (Sweden);  and there  is much point in the question.   when the Congress settled down  to the  discussion of &quot;world revolution,&quot;  a strangej cleavage  appeared between the  Bolsheviks  (Communists) and Syndicalists;  andj their differences could not  be composed.   The  latter  seem  to have  been  in  theI majority, but the differences cut  so deep that the  negotiations  for Scandinavian co-operation  failed, and the question of adherence to the Third International had to.J be postponed for  further deliberation.     The third occasion was the meeting in Copenhagen.  The leaders of the Social Democratic Party and the Central trade unions organisations in Sweden, Denmark, Norway,  and Finland sent  out invitations to all  the  organised workers in their countries, and the delegates met at the Scandinavian  Workers&apos;  Congress.   Four hundred delegates attended, and  the  Congress was opened by the Danish  Labour Minister, Stauning, who struck the keynote, of the  Congress in his  declaration  that- j&quot; Scandinavian labourers intend to revolutionise societv, but will  follow the  laws of;,.V-&apos;,                                                  t/ 3 (volution.&quot;  Mr. Lansbury was present, and spoke in very different tones from those  -vbich characterise his &quot;Daily Herald&quot; letters.  The Congress was notable for its  sharp criticism, of the Soviet  regime,  under which &quot;trade  unions are socialised,(that  is, in plain Danish, annulled&quot;  (J. P. Nielsen).  Madsen (Denmark) stated  thatWhe Danish Labour Party &quot;is firmly resolved not to leave that line of democracy itBad  followed hitherto.&quot;    Branting&apos;s speech, however, evoked the&apos;most applauselip en he declared that &quot;when we give up the democratic principles we will  findRurselves on  the wild sea without a compass.&quot; I&apos;s   The Congress closed with the overwhelming decision against joining the Moscowinternational and the passing of a resolution to adhere  to the  old Social Democratic
International by 350 votes to 1.  It is to be noted that the obstinate 3 per cent, infavour of Moscow still remained;  but  the  feeling of the Congress was clearly infavour of evolution and not revolution.    Clearly the significance of this series  of events can be exaggerated.   Affairsare not sufficiently stable as yet for any final reliance to be placed on such rejectionsof the counsels of the Extremists.  If prices should rise again sharply or wages be cut down, no doubt the  atmosphere would change.    But it  is  obvious that theworkers of Scandinavia do not at present favour revolution, and  it is probable thecentre of gravity lies farther south-in Berlin,  While  Germany rejects Bolshevismwe need not expect a revolutionary outbreak farther north.  But unsettlement there,and a wage crisis in Scandinavia,  would create a grave situation for  all northern europe.   &quot;The small States cannot lead a  world revolution,&quot; said Zeta Hoeglundat the Stockholm Congress, and this represents a real conviction.  The workers areprepared to follow the lead of the large States.    February 3, 1920.
