THIS D0CU1MT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC              MOT:STY&apos;S GOVERNMENTjUP. 529Present Position of HousingH.15Memorandum by..the Minister of Health.                      1.  Housing Progress.               s          Since the beginning of November the progress  of  theHousing &quot;.;&apos;ork of the Ministry and of Local Authorities has  showngroat acceleration, owing to the fact that  the schemes  arereaching the final stages in steadily increasing numbers weekby week.   It will be seen from the table below that more  cases have been disposed of during the last three months than in theprevious ten.   Many of the agreements with the Federated  Buildersand others for the provision of big.batches of houses have not yetbeen completed and the figures therefore do  not appear  in thisreturn: but  I am  satisfied that our programme for the  erection&quot;of 200,000 during the year will materialize, provided thenecessary labour and capital (matters over  which the Ministry ofHealth has no control) are forth-comi&quot;g*          The Appendix gives the list of places where final approval of  tenders has been given and where work should be  inprogress, subject to the limitations of  labour, transport andweather.          The following table shews the  acceleration of progressin submission and approval of house plans  and  tenders since  the1st.

          Since the arrangements with the Federated. Builderswere concluded two months ago, the Housing Commissionershave held numerous conferences of local authorities andbuilders with a view to securing that the building tradeshall undertake a definite, programme of building in each area during the coming; year, and with the object of fixingprices at which the builders will agree to build-.   TheNational Federated Builders are assisting in every possible way and the scheme is making satisfactory progress.          In the London district special  steps have beenta..en to accelerate the programmes of the local authorities;Separate conferences are being held with the representatives1&apos;of each of the local  aithorities in the district and time limits are laid down, fixing the dates by which various stages of their housing schemes must be completed.          In order to assist  local authorities who arebackward in their housing preparations or whose own plans are too expensive) a  large  number of standard plans havebeen  prepared  based on the  plans which have  proved most satisfactory in the various regions  of the country.   Thesestandard plans are available  for distribution together  with theappropriate bills  of  quantities and  will  enable local  authoritiesto  proceed very rapidly  with  arrangements for actual  construction,           Proposals by House  Builders  to  build houses  on  partlydeveloped  estates  for sale  to Loe?.l  Authorities arc now beginning  to materialize.   During  last  meek-, for  example,1125  fresh house  plans were submitted  by private  builders.                       2. SUBSIDY.           The  Housing (Additional  Powers)  Act was  passed  on the 23rd December.   Since  then the  scheme  contemplated for the erection of houses  under  the  Subsidy has obtained Treasury sanction and,  having been agreed with the trades  concerned,  was made public  on 9th January.   Steps  have been taken to secure
secure that the widest publicity shall be given to the scheme,Copies of the scheme, with an explanatory leaflet, have been circulated to builders through the Builders&apos; Associations,  to employers of labour, and to landowners.   Arrangements have alsobeen made to obtain publicity for the scheme through the medium of the press, including the local newspapers, the tradeand technical journals, and weekly papers circulating amonglandowners.   It is proposed to obtain from the local authoritiesa monthly return showing the progress of the subsidy scheme.The first return will be obtained on the 1st February.                   5. FIMANCE.          Local Bonds    Regulations governing the issue ofLocal Bonds have been drafted and have been considered by theTreasury.   The main outstanding questions arc the rate ofinterest to be fixed and the date of issue.    On these pointsthere is a difference between the Chancellor of the Exchequer,and myself, which is the subject of a separate CabinetIiemorandum.          Sir John Ferguson, Joint Manager  of Lloyds Bank,has undertake.-&apos; to advise the Department  on matters arisingout of the issue of  these  Bonds  and with regard  to the propaganda necessary to  secure their success.   vIt has beenarranged to  institute an active  propaganda  campaign as soonas  the outstanding  financial questions referred to  above are settled.           Issue of  Stock.    As  regards  the  extra Londonauthorities,  it i3  proposed that the County Councils underthe powers of  the recent Act shall raise money required for housing  purposes by the  issue  of Stock or otherwise andadvance  it to  the  local  authorities.           Otherwise, many  Local  Authorities are  in difficulties,with  regard  to  the  raising of  money;  and will  be  so,  I am                            -3-
afraid, until by one or other of the above devices,  reliefcan be obtained.   In some cases, however, we have beenable to help by bringing them into touch with financial institutions of various kinds.                     4 m LABOUR          The position as regards labour is getting  steadilyworse.   h letter has been written to the Building ResettlementCommittee, and was before them at their last meeting onJanuary 20th, pointing out that it is a month since  the PrimeMinister asked them to provide a large number of additionalmen to meet the needs of the housing programme.   The 3uildingResettlement Gommittee have appointed a special&apos;sub-Committee to formulate their proposals and ii is expected that this Sub-Committee will report early next week.   If as is feared maybe the case, the proposals of the Building ResettlementCommittee are not adequate, I have arranged to lay the factsbefore the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congresswhom I have arranged to see on the 4th February,   I proposeto circulate a further statement on this matter at an earlydate.                     5. PROFITEERING.          In order to secure a complete and rapid investigation of the prices of building materials, arrangements have been madewith the Board of Trade for the constitution of a specialBuilding liaterialG Committee to be set up under theProfiteering i.ct: and Mr, McCurdy himself has undertaken totake charge of this work.                     6. PRIORITY.          &quot;Regulations under Section 5 of the new housing act governing the procedure of local authorities for the                             4,
purposes of priority building and other wor ;fs of lesspublic importance than houses have been issued, and anAppeal Tribunal in connection with this subject has nowbeen set up.                                   0. addison.istry of Health.  27.1.1920.
