SECRET    INTERIM REPORT OF THE LABOUR OCMMTES                 .TOTHE RT. HOI. SIR R0E5RT HOgp,  EnBSE.  K,C* MoP*MINISTER OF LABOUR       In order to obtain your assent to certain proposals upon which, in our opinion it Is necessary to take action immediate^ we have the honour to submit an Interim Report as follows;-      1,  We were convened by you to consider and make reoommenda- tions as to the best method of providing for the recruitment-and distribution of volunteer labour during an emergency.      2.   W.e have come to the conclusion that the proper principle is to distinguish between certain essential services whioh we refer to as national services  (e.g.foo&amp;,  transport, shipping) and services which we refer to as local servioes (e*g, trams, gas, electricity),  and to  place the responsibility for maintaining the national servioes primarily upon the  servioes themselves  assisted by Government agents and the responsibility for maintaining the local services primarily upon the local authorities.       Although the  responsibility-for recruiting for the  two kinds of servioes would in this  respeot  be  separated,  arrange- ments should be made for the fullest possible measure  of  co- operation between the &quot;national&quot; machinery  and the &quot;looal&quot; machinery.    In some areas  - it  is  to be hoped in  the  majority of areas -  this would result in  obtaining considerable  assistance from the looal  authorities  for the  maintenance  of national-servioes;  in other areas it might be possible,  if  necessary, for the Government machinery to assist  in tho maintenance  of  looal services,      3,   The general outline of  the arrangements whioh&quot; we propose is  as  follows:-       (a] We propose  that  while  each servioe  should be              primarily responsible  for its  own recru.it-            .  ing, arrangements should be made,  as  far as              is practicable,  to  ensure that  the recru.it-              ing  for the various national services  of              each centre should  be  carried  on in a  singl0              buildings    If the  Looal Authorities  at              theso  centres  can be induced to use  the same              building for their  own recruiting purposes,              so much the better  In  the interests of              effective co-ordination.        (b) tfo have prepared a provisional list  of  some              eighty  oentres at which two or  more national              services will  be requiring  labour and at              which  it,seems to be necessary to  set  up              maohlnery for  the purpose of co-ordination^              Each of these  centres  will  cover the  sur-              rounding area  In such  a way that  all  the/areas
IS I! 1                   areas  taken together will  cover  the                   whole  country.;   At. each centre  we sug-                   gest that  there.should  be  a Beoruiting  .                   and Co-ordinating office staffed so                   as possible  by  local officials of the                 .  national services concerned and.,ur$er the                   general charge  of a Chairman  (whV would be                   neither a  Government official nor a local                   authority  official, but ,  person of con-                   stderable  local  standing)  who would bp                  assisted-by- the  advice  of  a Committee eon-                &apos;  sisting of the- local representatives of the                  national services concerned^   It will be                  the duty of the  Chairman and his Committee                  to see that all  national services in the                 &apos;.area are properly supplied with labour;  to                  deal with deficiencies and surpluses as           .  ;   -  between one service and another,  and between                  one. part of the area and another; to co-operate               &apos;  -with the Local Authorities  in their  own  recruit-                : Ing and generally to .co-ordinate  the  recruiting                 &apos; efforts.;cn behalf of local  and national  services.          . :, (.c.)We  further suggest that  the centres with their                 surrounding areas--should-be grouped  in twelve                 divisions  (the present  Food Control  Divisions)               .  each under the general control of a  commissioner               &apos;v  (who would be a Government  Official)  whose Head-                 quarters should ordinarily  be  In the  same  town                 as. the  headquarters  of the  Food Commissioner and &apos;-  -               whose  function would be  to  co-ordinate the efforts                 of.the  Chairman and  Committees at the  different                /centres and particularly to arrange  for  dealing                 /With deficiencies and  surpluses of labour  as               ... between different centres In the  Division,,     4*    We contemplate  a central co-ordinating Committee,  consist-ing   of  representatives  of  Government Departments, and  a  controller inIsondon appointed.for  the  purpose  and  responsible to the Main Supplyand  Transport  Committee*     5o    Ponding general  approval of  the  foregoing recommendations,we are preparing provisional lists of men likely to be  competent  and&apos;willing  to  act as  Chairmen,, and.,  if approval is given, we should  pro-pose  to  approach the &quot;proposed  Chairmen at once  in  order to  obtain their consent  to serve and to  get  them to call  local meetings  of  thelocal representatives of the national servioes  concerned  in  orderfa)  to explain to  those representatives the  proposed procedure, and(b)  to reach agreed&apos; conclusions as to the precise  steps which  shouldbe taken  upon an emergency arising in - connection with the recruiting and distribution of volunteers,    17e  do not  propose to approach theloo^l authorities  or any of  their  officials  at this stage, although we hope that there will be the closest co-operation with the localauthorities during an emergency?    6*    It&apos;will be appreciated -that  (a)  and (b) above involve takingthe Chairmen&apos;and the officials who will form.the Commit too intocomplete  confidence beforehand, and it is desirable that sanctionshould at once be given for this  to be done9    We  desire to expressour conviction that this step is imperative..    It will bo  seen thatthe only non official persons to whom we desire to communicate our/proposalsOTSs  The Supply and Transport Committee are of.opinion that the Controller  &quot;&quot;should report to the Minister of Lab cor who would, when necessary,   bring questions submitted to him by the Controller before the Supply   and Transport Committee.
 proposals are  the prospective  Chairmen,  about  80  in  number, at the respective  centres.   These Chairmen will  be  most  carefully seleoted after  consultation with responsible officials of Government Departments, and we -believe that they,will  be entirely trustworthy in such a matter.    7.   We are satisfied that it would  be impossible to put our plan, or any satisfactory plan, into operation when an emergency actually occurred, unloss the Chairmen and the members of their Committees are fully acquainted with the proposed procedure in advance of an emergency and thus enabled to. settle In advance the general outline of action required,  (as regards Staff,premises,  equipment).  ,    8.   V/e accordingly ask for;-            (a) approval for the type of organisation outlined                  in paragraph 3 to deal with volunteer                  labour,            (b) authority to approach suitable men and to obtain                  their assent, to acting as Chairmen of local                  official.Committees during an emergency                  (paragraph 5); and .            (o) approval for our proposal that the Chairmen so                  soon.as they have agreed to serve,  should                  hold1a meeting of the members of their respeo-                  tlve Committees to draw up plans for volunteer                  recruiting within the area attached to the                  centre (paragraph 5).                           -Signed on behalf of the Committee..BtO.
