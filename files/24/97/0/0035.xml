All my frontier and trans-frontier correspondents agree that, during the     last  week or so,  tone of  Bolsheviks towards British  and  Persia  has  become more     (corrupt group), and  there is much talk of very early invasion of Persia and ejection     of British.  Yesterday I received telegrams saying that Bolsheviks  had  definitely      decided on immediate operations.          2. For the present I think it necessary to treat such reports with reserve.  The      Turkestan Commission has recently been  throughout Merv and Askabad, and there is      little doubt that these rumours emanate from entourage with  the view to making our      flesh creep.  Personally, I (? do omitted) not think that there  is any immediate danger      of any serious Bolshevik movement  so long as they consider there are possibilities of      coming to terms with us.   Such minor  affairs as Yamut raids are of  course always      possible.
