3-miHOUSING  BONDS.H.14.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.       The Cabinet will remember that  under theHousing (Additional Powers)  Act which  was passed atthe end of last Session Local Authorities were  em-powered to issue Local Bonds for financing their housing schemes.  The Regulations governing theissue of these bonds have been framed, and preparationshave boon made for the institution of  a vigorous public-ity campaign throughout the country.   Sir John Ferguson,Managing Director of Lloyds Bank, has agreed to take charge of the arrangements for this purpose.       Two questions, however, are outstanding, vizethe rate of interest and the date of issue.  I havebeen unable to reach an agreement with the Chancellorof the Exchequer in regard to these points, and as inmy opinion they are of vital importance, I feel bound.to bring them before the Cabinet.       I have represented to tho Chancellor of theExchequer in my opinion the issue should be made withoutdelay and that in view of the strong expression ofopinion of Sir John Ferguson I felt bound to ask himto agree to a rate of 5%%   I pointed out how vitally important it is to the Government and the Country thatthe money required for financing the Housing Schemeohould be forthcoming.   We simply  cannot afford to riska  failure.       In.my letter to the Chancellor I added - &quot;It is&quot;true that the representatives of the Local Authorities&quot;on the Goschen Committee were unwilling to  go beyond  5i &quot;per cent but recent events must I  think have modified &quot;their views, and there can be no doubt that only &quot;a few of the larger Local Authorities could borrow- 1
        &quot;mpney at less than 6 per cent at the present time.               &quot; I hope further that you will raise no        &quot;objection to our Starting our campaign at onoo with        &quot;&amp; view to getting tho Bonds issued early next month.        &quot;It does not seem to me that the Exchequer Bond issue        &quot;ought to stand in the way, as,we shall be appealing        &quot;to a quite different class of investors&quot;.               In reply the Chancellor expressed the, view        that Housing Bonds should not be Issued at present so        as &quot;to koep tho field clear for the new Exchoquor Bonds&quot;        and maintained his view that the rate of interest should        be 5-1 per cent,              ; I attach to this Memorandum a  copy of a letter        which I have received from Sir John Porguson on tho        subjectt  In view  of his  strong expression of opinion        I caahot tako the  responsibility of agreeing to a        limitation  of the  rate of interest to 6j per cent  or        to the -postponement  of the: rate of  issue without        submitting  tho  whole  case to  the Cabinet,                                             .           a      ,                    ;      : . &apos;  ,                                          CADDIS OH.                   -\&apos;  1         .            .  28&apos;.  1. 20.MINISTRY OF HEALTH.                            ,       .  r
                                  LLCXDS&quot;&quot;BANK LIMITED,                             /        711 Lombard Street^                                         L0HD0N.E,0.3i                                 27th January, 1920..Dear Dr. Addison,       The question of the rate of interest to bo allowodon tho Housing Bonds has been constantly before me duringthe past fortnight and I have had many opportunities  of discussing the subject with Banking friends and others whoagree with me absolutely that a    per  cent rate will spellignominious failure.   Nothing short of 6% will give  us theunqualified success the great importance of the Schemedemands.       There  is  an  insatiable demand for trade roquire-ments at rates of -J to 1 per cent  over  Bank rate  - meaningjust now 6-g and  7 per cent  and you will see the  greatestevidence of this in the  largo  increases of  curront advances in all  the Banks Annual Reports.   I feel  sure the GoschenCommittee, of which Mr. W*H.Goschen was. Chairman,  wouldnot care to  take the  responsibility now of recommending aSj^raie for  a successful issue.   I donH  want to assumetoo positive  an attitude  but there is  no  question what  the&quot;result  would be, and in view of the great urgency of Housing surely the  great thin&amp; is.to get tho money at onoo.        If Birmingham &amp;c.  think 6% too high a rate lether borrow on her Deposit Receipt at the best rate obtainable.                          Yours very truly,                             (Sgd.)
