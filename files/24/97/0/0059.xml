(raiS.,DOCflTOTT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRIT AMI C MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENTSECRET.CP. 557.CABIN E. TiOOVERNMMT 01 IRELAND BILL,CUSTOMS AND EXCISE,(Note by the Minister  of pensions. )     1/hile I recognise that it is desirable  to  appear togive as wide powers of taxation as possible  to  the Irishparliament, I am unwilling to give either Exnljur-cr^Cnja4^me-for the following reasons1.  T6 give Excise alone would be illusory;  a reduction bythe Irish parliament would assist the producer  and not theconsumer, unless there wag a corresponding reduction 6fCustoms Duty; an increase without a corresponding increaseof customs Duty would destroy the local industry.2.  The grant of Excise Duties would only be valuable ifaccompanied by the right to vary the corresponding CustomsDuties, but if this right were given customs barriers wouldhave to be set up between the United Kingdom and Ireland.3.  Customs barriers would be costly and irritating, and  ifonce set up, the main argument against giving  full  rights toimprove Customs Duties would be gone; the Irish would belikely to claim full rights  in order  that  they might develop their own trade policy.     A different trade policy so developed would  tend tcseparation,  and would impede federation if other units ofthe United Kingdom were given national parliaments.(intld.)
