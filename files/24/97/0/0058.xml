CABINETKote by the President of the Board, of education of IRELAND B3XL0U3T0M8 AFP WimOf the three possible methods of dealing with customs and Excise sifter Union   (1)  -The transfer of Excise to Ireland without any power        of dealing with Custorui:   (2)  The transfer of Excise With a oerratpoadiag j^owtr to        impose Customs Duties oh Excisaable articlea: and   (3)  The transfer of tho entire power over ExOise and        Customs:                                        *  -I prefer tht third.     The first coursa hardly offer a &apos;a sufficient /inaneialconcession to Ireland to balance the administratiTe^inoorrrenieiveBewhich would attend it.     The second coursa erects a Customs barrier but only for revenue purposes and would certainly raise a demand for thefurther concession of full powers to direct the trade policy ofmote the principal object of the Bill, i.e. the reechoillationof the English and Irish races.  It may, no doubt, be urged&apos;that the concession of the Customs to Ireland is open to live)objections ?-      lat*- as to deprive this,.country of its security for the.            contribution;      2nd.- as    likely to be injurious to British trade;     - 3rd.- as likely to constitute a&apos; bar to the Union of N^rth            and South;      4th.- as antagonistic to the federal principle;     , 5th.- as making for the reparation of Ireland and  Great&apos;            Britain.-      Not much importance is to be attached to  the first object- ion since, under the scheme of the Bill, tho Imperial.Treasury will still collect  the Irish  Income Tax and if any insecurity, were felt at the time of Union as to the payment of  the residue the country.      The third course is bolder but is more likely to win* initial support in Ireland for the Bill and ultimately to pro-
q&apos;f the contributions, jBight&quot; $OitteiE&amp;e to^oilo^rtr^ha^Ouytcyiii^..     Nor is  the second objection serious in view of the ^rwtpowers of retaliation possessed by  the wealthier and largercountry.     The third objection is more serious.  Undoubtedly theNorth would  think more soriously, of the oomplete fusion of theSouth if it  involved the concession to Ireland  of a separatepower over trade policy.  As against this we may say with certainty that the Gorth and South  will be separated for aconsiderable number of years, and secondly, that under the-terms-of the Bill  a very groat deal of substantial union may beeffected short of the complete union which would oarry with itthese fiscal privileges.   It la true that there are fewinstances known to history of a Stats within a  J^eae-ration possess-ing a Customs Frontier,  Bavaria in the old GeSBSJGLJFederationis the principal, perhaps the only, instance.   On the other  handa Federation of the British Empire-might easily be brought into being without the abandonment by the Dominions  of their powers over Excise  and Customs.   Tho lart argument will, of course,have weight  with many minds.  It had weight with the mi)ad ofWilliam Pitt-.    On  the other hand, the fact that Ireland,1s an Island does differentiate its ease very, eleafly from theoases of Wales and Scotland, quite - apari;jfr^jB^^unistanc-e?rooted in history and National feeling, and that: political settlement of the difficulty is to  be preferred which hoidsout the best prospect of reconciling the Irish  Pace to their continued political  existence as ah integral part of theBritish Snpire,     For those, reasons I should be  willing to ooneeda..f^llfiscal rights with respect to Excise and Customs to a UnitedIreland dosireus of  exercising tEoso rights*                                    (Intel. )how..L.E.Board of Education-    5 l.s t J&apos; anu ary s 192C.
