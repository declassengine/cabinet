yJ(THIS  gCggMT IS THE PROPERTY Of HIS BRITATOC MAJESTY15 JQVMMT) .ll^S secretary,   &apos; C.P. 512.           ?,ASIMIT,    THE GROWTH  OF  iiXPENDITURE ON EDUCATION,       (Reference-C,P. 329),(Note by the Chancellor of  the ExchequerQ     I call the serious attention  of  the Cabinet to the immense                                                      andgrowth of expenditure on education since the Aot of 1918/to thehuge liabilities in prospect.     I ask for a cabinet ruling that  the Ministry of Education&apos;should at once take into consideration     1. the question of the control exercised by it over the        expenditure of the Local Authorities on which the        State contribution automatically depends.     2. The possibility of securing a larger proportionate        contribution from the rates.     3. The postponement of further developments until the        finances of the csuntry can better  afford them.     The matter is urgent.  The attached memorandum sete outthe position in detail,                              (intlld.)  A.Cleasury,  s,w.iI   27th January,  1920*
   The growth in education  expenditure is an outcome ofpolicy - not,  as Mr. tfisher&apos;s memorandum would tendto suggest,  the inevitable  result  of a natural law.In the year before  the  war  the increase was very slowEven after the war  began  it was gradual, and notcontinuous,   &quot;When Mr. Fisher became Minister of Educationit grew rapid.  Since the Act of 1918 it has beenbreathless.    By far the largest  item of expenditure (at present,and pending the developments foreshadowed In higher education) is the provision for grants in respectof Public Elementary schools.  The following figuresfrom the Estimates  illustrate the  foregoing statement as to the rate of increase  :*Grants in aid of Elementary Education.                                                 1908 - 9                         11,080,100     1913 -14                         11,790,000     1914 -15          *               12,287,000     1915 -16                         12,483,000     1916 -17                         12,412,750     1917 -18                         15,843,750     1918 -19                         15,667,698     1919 -20                         25,013,500     1920 -21                         33,250,000   (approxi                                                     mate)   Of a total increase of  24,235,000 in the Board  ofEducation vote in two  years,  15,000,000 is ascribedto increase of teachers salaries.  It should benoted that the amounts due  to  &quot;devaluation of money?and  to &quot;levelling up&quot;  respectively are  not, andprobably  cannot be distinguished.  But  the increasesalready given, and those yet to  be given under the
BurftJam report,  will under the term  of  that report,be guaranteed permanently,  whereas  the  devaluation.of money may be in part at least  only temporary..Consequently there is a probability  of  the teacher&apos;ssalary in future representing a purchasing-powerenormously greater than that  of the  pre-war salary.Mr. Fisher sees this quite clearly.  Speaking  to the secondary School  Teachers on January 2nd he said&quot;During the last three years  the  average salary inelementary schools had increased  by  89  per cent, andin secondary schools by 80 per cent.  There was every reason to believe that the rise in  the  cost of livingwas due to exceptional circumstances, and would notbe maintained while they had  every  reason to hope  thatthe increased salaries would  be permanent&quot;.  The factthat the exchequer pays three-fifths of the salariesreduces the disposition of the local educationauthorities to resist the demands of the teachers.The Board of Education, so far from stiffening suchresistance, views the generosity  of  the local  educationauthorities with complacency,  and would apparentlylike to stimulate it still further  (of  paragraph of Mr. Fisher*s Memorandum).    The formidable nature of  the  further increases tobe looked for is indicated in the Memorandum,  butthe liabilities cannot be put into  figures.  The main items  are    ,    (a) Increases of elementary teachers&apos;  salaries underthe Burnham Report.  (This will appear  in-Estimates for1921 -2).    (b)  &quot;The salaries of teachers  in  secondary and other                              2.
   higher  schools have lagged behind.&apos;   They have  still   to be readjusted and levelled up&quot;.  This  means an   increase in the Deficiency Grant for Higher  Education,   which brings Government grants up to 5($  of  expenditure   by an authority.       (o)  Normal growth of pensions charge and  of cost   Of recently introduced- reforms,  (see paragraph  10  of   Mr.  Fisher&apos;s Memorandum).  This means about   3,000,000   over next year&apos;s figure.       (d)  Abolition of half-time and raising  of school   age.  This is not provided for in 1920-21 but  it   can  hardly be much longer delayed.  Estimated  in   1918 to  cost  1,000,000 - probably too low a figure^                                                      *       (e)  Compulsory continuation schools. Not yet   operative, and will not be fully operative until 1926.   Estimated at  8,750,000 in 1918 since when educational   costs,  especially salaries, have risen largely.   This   will involve additional schools and additional  teachers.   If the provisions of the Act are to become operative,   the  schools must be ouilt and the teachers trained   before  1925.  Consequently the oharges will  begin to   mature  before that date.       (f)  All the above &quot;bear very little relation to   the  additional burden which the taxpayer will  be asked   eventually to bear&quot;.  It is the duty of every  Local  ^Education Authority under the Act to make a scheme   for  completing their provision of. education of all  grades   and  such schemes when made and approved by the Board of   Education, will be aided by substantive  grants.   Thisi.e.  They have  only increased by 80$.
     appears  to  be  the biggest contingent liability still     to be faced, and it is also the one which can most     easily be increased or reduced, aocording to the nature     of the policy  followed..  To quote Mr. Fisher&apos;s memorandum,     &quot;The future expansion of the cost will depend partly upon     the liability  of suooessive parliaments&apos;^  Another factor     will be  the degree of resistance which sucoeBsive     Chancellor   of the Exchequer  offer to the demands of     successive  Ministers of Education/ 5.      in considering expenditure  on education, it should be     remembered  that there has been an increase of over      1,100*000  in  the grants to Universities and Colleges     and that we are constantly being warned that this repre-     sents no more  than the pale shadow of the demand present-     ly to be made  on us in this connection. 6.      Under the Education (Scotland) Act 1918 Scotland gets     ll/8o of any increase in the English grants for education,     and under the  Irish Bill introduced last session Ireland           &apos;extra     would get 9/80*  therefore eve3gj/  which goes to education     grants in England means ah extra 5/- for Scotland and     Ireland, whether or not they set up services corres-     ponding  to  those for which the increase is given.7.     The proportion of the expenditure of local education     authorities payable from grants has arisen since 1913-14     from 46$ to 53$.  Had the pre-war proportion between     grants and  rates been preserved, the total of grants     for 1919-20 would have been  24,015,220 instead of      27,932,970, - a saving of nearly  4,000,000.  (The     saving for  1920*21 would of course be much larger).     There appears  to have been an  excessive shifting of the     burden of education  expenditure  on to the  Exchequer.     It may be. pointed  out  that in  arriving at  the figure of
the  substantive grant for elementary education a deduction is made of the produce of a sevenpenny rate.The  &quot;devaluation of money&quot; has not yet been reflected inrateable values, and to a considerable extent it oannotbe so  reflected so Ions as the Restriction of Rent Actsare  in force*:*  The increased expenditure of localauthorities consequently calls for a hir^her poundage ofrates.  But the sevenpenny rate remains fixed in theformula on which the elementary education grant depends.It would be reasonable that it should now be raised - aait can be by regulation.  The principle of this appearsto be  admitted by the Note to Mr. Fisher18 memorandum in which it is proposed that the rule under which&quot;necessitous areas&quot; receive a special grant of one halftheir  expenditure in excess of a rate of 27d. should be modified by the substitution of 48d, for 27d.  It is tobe hoped that immediate steps will be taken to carryout  this proposal.   The $hite paper estimate of the Future Exchequer balance sheet  gave  45,900,000 as ths probable total of EducationGrants in a normal year.  Thr total for the present year was  put at  41,000,000.  If we deduct  2,500,000 for theOfficers Training goheme we get  38,500,000.   Add tothis the increase on the English estimate of  10,800,000and  the due proportion for Scotland and Ireland,  2,700,000,and  the total grants for 1920-21 will be  52,000,000. This.is already more than ,-26,000.000 in excess of the assumedfigure for a normal year.   It  is almost impossible to frame an  estimate  of thexincreases foreshadowed in paragraph 4 above, but a roughguess  may be attempted.

On the other hand that figure may bean Sunder-estimate; and  as  no account is taken of theprobable increase in state-aid to Universities, and no allowance is made for unforeseen contingencies, thetotal is more likely to be under - than over - stated.
