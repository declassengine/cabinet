JD-* Rp^iTL6^ Js the  PROPERTY of hire ,*&apos;;V\N:ILC *.1AJ33LY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Military Secret.                 1282        From Viceroy, Foreign Department, to Secretary of State for India,                              2nd February 1920.                                (Received 3rd.)    132 8.  Please refer to my telegram of 28th December, 1762 S., regarding Persiansituation, to which we have received no reply.    We have now- considered  in Council, with special reference to our commitmentsoutside India, question of calls upon Indian Army which may conceivably he made inconsequence of recent Bolshevik successes and strengthening of pan-Islamic agitation.We are in particular much exercised over situation in Persia, and our difficulties are increased by our absence of information regarding policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  on the  subject,  especially as to whether, in the event of any serious militarythreat to  Northern Persia, it may he held that British Government  are  morallycommitted by Anglo-Persian agreement to despatch of military aid for defence of thecountry.   In Eastern Persia lack of transport, apart from  other considerations, wouldin any case make increase of our present forces there impossible.  At the same time,we foresee that  it  may be suggested that reinforcements should be  despatched from mesopotamia to North-West Persia, and  that  additional Indian troops should be sentto Mesopotamia, both to replace such reinforcements and to strengthen Mesopotamiangarrison against possibility of  unrest spreading thither in consequence of agitation in persia, or  pan-Islamic pressure from the north  of Mesopotamia.   We therefore wishto enquire what is policy  of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government in regard  to Persia in theevent of attack by  Bolsheviks and how it is proposed to give  effect to it.  We desireto make it clear, in our judgment, internal conditions and conditions on our frontierare such that, in juncture contemplated, it  would be impossible to despatch any moretroops overseas without grave  risk, and we think it our duty to apprise His Majesty&apos;sGovernment ,pf this fact.   Troops we have are war weary and in want of leave,  andany large  expansion of  our Army will, at present, be practically impossible owing todisinclination of men in the  North to  be recruited, partly owing to heavy calls on them  during the war and partly due to present political situation.  In addressing youon this question we desire again to refer to  suggestions contained in my telegram of28th December last, that British control of Caspian seems  to offer best solution.
