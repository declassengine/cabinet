A SUGGESTED PEHMMTO ORGANISATION ffOR MEETING STRIKES *          Memorandum lay the Chairman, Supply and Transport Committee..        On November l8th and 19th last,  Conferences  of  the  Cabinettensidored my Memorandum of November 10th,  1919,  (C.P.97) inwhieh suggestions ware made for the treat ion of  a permanent or-ganiiat&amp;wi f or meeting strikes, and oame to the  following conclusions:-    (l)     Tint some nucleus should be  kept in  being,  and        the Supply and Transport Committee  was authorised to        continue its investigations into the character  and        extent of a nucleus organisation which it was thought        desirable to preserve, but approval of any suoh .organlsa-.        tion was with*held until the Conference  had a concrete        scheme before it. (Conference of November 18th, 19X9).    (2)     That the Stores&apos; involved in the scheme of the        Supply and Transport Committee should be withheld from        disposal for one month, pending consideration of the        financial aspect of the scheme (Conference of November        19th, 1919).        In accordance with the above decisions,  the- Supplyand Transport Committee, its affiliated Sub-Committees, and thedepartments associated with it have been engaged in preparingschemes for meeting a strike by railway workers, coal miners, andtransport workers, whether separately or together, and  as these schemes are now approximately complete X bring the question once more to the notice of the Cabinet,        The schemes in question may be divided into  two categories,via:- sthemes thieh involve expenditure during the preparatoryperiod, and schemes which (apart from.loss  to the government through the retention of surplus stores from disposal)  do not involve expenditure during the preparatory  period.  particulars of these two classes will be found in Appendices A and  B- 1 m
respectively.        One of the schemes referred to in Appendix A.,  viz.  thatof the Ministry of Pood for road transport, has been inexistence for some time and its expenses (viz,  5*2,000 per annum)are borne on the vote of the Ministry of Food,   The other schemes will involve the following expenditure during thepreparatory period:*                                     Initial         Recurring        Communications            (Aerial jiost, wireless             &amp;o.,)                    4,000 *         77,000        Electrical Services              *               ?00        Motor Spirit                  1,050        Road Transport                1,8^0 x            700        Transport &quot;by Sea                100Total:-   7,000           78,200        By fay the most important arid expensive of the aboveschemes is the proposed organisation to deal with communi-cations during an emergency, the plans for which havebeen worked out in view of the inability of the Army toundertake communications work during a strike and the inability of the Post Office to prevent sabotage orprovide for the transmission of urgent Government messagesby wireless or aeroplane.   There is no need to labour the importance to the Government of possessing a reliabloand secret system of communications during seriousindustrial trouble, for on communications must depend theproper distribution of foodstuffs and coal and the movementof troops.   I fear that if serious industrial troubleX  ffOTB.   This figure does not include the value of       articles retained from disposal or th^ cost     ,  of removal and storage of such articles.   These       are shown in Appendix C.                                  2 -
occurs in the near future attempts may he made to  cut  tele-graph and telephone wires, so that apart from disaffectionamongst the Post Office staff itself,  the ordinary telegraphand telephone services cannot he guaranteed.   The  schemewhich &quot;has been worked out by the Air Ministry represents,in my opinion, the minimum provision which should  he made.     Apart from the expenditure shown above,  loss  willaccrue to the Government through the retention of  certainsurplus stores t?om disposal.   The stores in question arerequired for the purpose of administering the above schemes  and for assisting the Railway Companies to keep running.    They consistof motor lorries, motor vans, Crossley tenders, towing chassis,workshops, store trucks, motor cars and cycles, bedsteads, bedding,crockery, cutlery, tents and huts, and their  estimated value isshewn in Appendix C. ( about  290,000).   The largest  item in this appendix is one of  75,000 in respect of 100  motor lorries  whichit is desired to retain from disposal to enable the Road transport organisation to gender some slight assistance in the transport oftroops during a railway strike.  The Cabinet  will  remember  that reported on December 10th last that the General Staff  looked to the Minister of Transport to undertake the responsibility for moving troops, but that if the railways were  not available  theMinister of Transport had no motor lorries or other means  oftransport.  An organisation is now being concerted between theWar Office and the Ministry of Transport whereby charabancs  and motor omnibuses in the Provinces will be utilised for transportingtroops in emergencies, and the 100 motor lorries,  the  retention ofwhich from disposal is desired, are to form the nucleus of  this organisation.     The total loss through retention of articles  from disposalis estimated at  263,886.  To this must be added a sum of 270 per week ot  14,040 per annum, v?hich represents the cost of storage of the articles in question, and a further sum of   7,388

The total  sum Is given abcve as approximately                   t  290,500*      The cost  of the proposed emergency schemes (not including the  Road Transport Scheme of the Ministry of Feed) is therefore                                                                  -     !i                           S as followst-             Initlain                        Recurring.               14,382.                        92,240 per annum to this must be added the sum of  290,030 referred to abfve, and  I think  it  would be wise to allow some sum as a margin, say  1000 in the case of initial and  2,000 in the case of recurring                                      r I expenditure.      If the Cabinet sanction the above schemes and the expenditure  neoessary for their operation, the question arises as  ta the Vote  oil which that expenditure should be borne/ One alternative  is  to provide the necessary money by allocating each item of expenditure to  the vote of the most appropriate Department. If  this principle is adopted the allocation would presumably be somewhat as  fallows                Scheme *                  Vote,                &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;...........nn-fii.ni                i in.......

It was however generally agreed at. the last meeting of the  Supply  and  Transport Committee that the. better course would be  for the Government to deal with the matter  quite openly and to introduce a separate $jte foj? all the additional expenditure required by  the emergency organisations, the vote in question to stand in the name of the Treasury, which Department would generally be  regarded  as  neutral.  The Committee felt that although  the introduction of a specific vote would be regarded as a direct challenge by disaffected elements, concealment would be both Impraoti- - cable and undesirable.  It would be very difficult for instance to
conceal the establishment of 65 fixed and 12 mobile  wireless stations, and it would be prejudicial to the ordinary workof Government Departments if extraordinary expenditure ofthis kind were carried on their Votes.      The Committee accordingly recommend to the Cabinet that  thefollowing action,should be taken:-             1.   That Cabinet approval should be given                  to the schemes outlined in Appendices A  &amp;                  B of this Memorandum;             2.   That sanction should be given to the                  expenditure involved by those schemes,                  viz. an initial-expenditure of  14,388                  and an annual expenditure estimated at                   92,240; and sums of  1000 and  2000                  respectively as margins for these ,two                  classes of expenditure; &apos;             3*   That sanction should be given for the                  retention from disposal of the necessary                  stores which are valued at  263,886 and                  for an expenditure of  14,040 per annum                  in respect of storage;             4.   That financial,provision should be made                  for the necessary expenditure by means                  of a separate Vote, for which the Treasury                  should be responsible;             5*   That these schemes should be accepted by the                  Cabinet on the understanding that they do                  hot fully provide for a great industrial                  emergency but  that much improvisation will                  be necessary.                  Even with the authority sought the ability                  of the Government to deal with such a crisis                  will be l&amp;neasurably less than was the case                  in September 1919,Ministry of Transport,                     (sgd)   Erie Geddes.

The Communications bub-committee have prepared a scheme    . for maintaining ooiamunicat ion by wireless,&apos;aeroplane, and     desjateh riders during a strike/&apos; The scheme has been out     dovm to a minimum, and its limited capacity is clear from&apos;the     fact that only about 1200 messages a day could be handled in     London.   The-s&amp;heme involves the co-opearation of the tores   .  Services and provides for a central wireless message office     in London, and for six main wireless routes from London.   The   ..

The emergency schemes cover the supply and distributionof Yeast, Milk, Pish) Meat , Potatoes, Flour, Wheat, Sugar,Butter, Cheese, Bacon, Ham, Lard, Margarine and Tea.&apos;  Theschemes will vary in operation according to the nature if thestrike, i.e. Coal, Railway, Transport, or General Strike.       Under the Schemes., foodstuffs will, through the agency -of the Ministry&apos;s provincial organisation, (i.e. Food Commis-sloneye and Food Committees) be distributed by road, coastal, &apos;canal and railway transport, according to the suitability andavailability of those services.  Equitable distribution amongst.the Community will, where necessary, be secured by special restrictions (e.g&apos;. rationing, etc), over and above thoseexisting normally.       To aid the clearance of imports, and to assist distribu-tlon from the ports, a further scheme of devolution has beenarranged and will, if the need require^ be operated.  Underthis scheme Emergency Departments  (in charge of officials en-trusted with full powers) will be  established at Liverpool,   -Bristol and Hull.(2)  Expenditure  during the preparatory period.       The Road Transport Staff  is  a nucleus staff employedsolely for emergency purposes.   Its approximate cost is 1,000 per week,  which is however  already provided  for- out ofthe vote of the Ministry of Pood.   Apart  from thlfc, und  the  &apos;cost of printing, no other  costs are being incurred during thisperiod.(3)  Expenditure  during  an  emergency.                       .      (a) Coal  Strike.  As  the  degree  of  operation of  emergency         measures depends  upon,, the effect of a  strike  on ncizmal         transport  services, an  estimate  of  expenditure  during         such  a strike is  impossible.

The Committee has no control over theremaining 10,000 odd boats on the canals which are owned by private firms, uncontrolled carriers, and small bye-traders.If the strike did not affect the boatmen the Committee would at once direct the ebnir^A6&amp;rMnniers and carrying companies to devote all their attention to the carriage of food-stuffsor coal, whichever is considered the more urgent at the moment.If the strike affected the boatmen and canal workers it wouldbe necessary to call for volunteers to staff the locks0 pumpingstations, and boats *COAL SUB-COMMITTEE (COAL MINES DEPARTMENT).     The plans of the Coal Sub-Committee which uses the machineryof the Coal Mines Department for meeting a strike are as followsj-     Immediately a strike appeared likely the local officers ofthe Department would be warned to bring.the emergency machineryfully up-to-date  the following orders would be signed and despatched in confidence to all local officials concerned, vizsGas and Coal (Emergency) Order, Lighting,. Heating and Power(Emergency,) Order, and Coal and Fuel (Emergency) Order.- -Arrangements would also be made with local collectors of customsfor plans to deal with loading and bunkering of British and                                                      foreign/
foreign vessels. ,  Firms of repute would also be deputed todeal with the discharging of vessels and the handling of the cargoes and the chartering, stemming and loading of vesselswhere the normal trade channels could not be used.   Arrange-ments would also be made to take the following action:-1, -    To notify the representatives of the Coal MinesDepartment at the ports of the need for restrictingcoal to trawlers and to Irish and Cross ChannelServices in the event of a strike; :2. &apos;    To prepare instructions to Colliery companies to take measures to keep pits working to thefullest extent, eg..by dumping;3.,     To prepare instructions to Lo*cal Fuel Over-seers with regard to requisitioning stocks,,theintroduction of permit system, if absolutely necessary, and the provision of fuel wood supplies;  .4....    To arrange with the Ministry of Transport for railway Companies to take possession of coal ontheir systems and to place it at the disposal ofthe nearest Local Fuel Overseer;-5*     To prepare Instructions to all Public utility undertakings with regard to conservation of suppliesof coal during a strike;6..    To consider the statistics required during  uthe strike,, and prepare Instructions to the collieries, public utility undertakings, etc.who may have to pro vided statistics.        On the declaration of A.strike a state of emergencywould be declared and telegrams issued to all local officers to enforce their strike schemes..   The Ministry of shipping would be requested to stop and,, where possible, recall boats teaftftdi with coal proceeding abroad..
