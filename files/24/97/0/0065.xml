During the last few weeks a development of considerable importance has takenplace in the machinery of the Appointments Department  for dealing with candidatesseeking direct  entry into business or  professional life without an intervening period oftraining.   The position of candidates of this class has been attracting increased attentionfor some considerable time.   The weekly influx of candidates  seeking training under theMaintenance and Training  Grants Scheme  was practically balanced by the  numbersplaced in training, and with the fixing of the final date for applications under  this scheme,.in most cases  at the 31st December, the outstanding balance  of applications becomes a diminishing quantity.  On the other hand, the task of the  Department in finding direct employment was becoming  more and more  onerous.   At  the present moment theregister of ex-Service men available for appointments totals  16,450.  During the  past few weeks the register has  increased by  some 1,000 candidates a  week, as againstabout 500 placed each week in appointments.    To deal with the situation, steps have been taken to expand the work of the DistrictSelective Committees of professional and business men who  are giving assistance both tothe Department  and to the  men  for whom it is  responsible.  These committees were intended,  from the beginning, to deal  both  with questions of appointments and oftraining.   Their activities, however, have been mainly developed on the side of training.The Interviewing Boards appointed  by the District Selective  Committees have been   (0 I960)  140  2/20 H &amp; S                                                     I
 -concerned primarily with the selection of candidates for training, the recommendation of grants under the Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme) and the supervision of the training vacancies placed at the disposal of the Department.  Steps are now being taken to promote throughout the country the formation by the District Selective Committees of Appointments Panels, parallel with these Interviewing Boards, but  concerning them- selves solely with the question of the provision  of direct employment.     This step is consequent upon the experience gained since late November of last  year in the London  district.   Following upon the appeal,to employers at a Mansion House meeting in that  month, over 300  professional and  business  men  in the Directorate voluntarily placed their services at the  disposal of the Department.   From the pool  thus provided panels  were formed, the members sitting in rotation in order to avoid undue pressure.  All applicants for employment are being interviewed by one or other of these panels, special panels being formed so far as possible to deal with particular industries or trades, while general panels  deal with the less specialised openings.  The advantages of such a system are numerous.   On the one hand it becomes easier to eliminate the candidates Avho are not suitable for the  type of opening with which the Department is concerned. On the other hand, expert opinion is brought to  bear upon the submission of candidates for vacancies already at the disposal of the Department, and the influence of individual members of panels can be brought to bear in support of the candidature.  Security is given  that only candidates who are suitable will be submitted to employers, and that steps will be promptly taken to  fill any  openings offered to the Department.  Advice, encouragement  and direction can be  given by  experts which will  be of  the greatest assistance to candidates in prosecuting their independent efforts to  obtain employment. At the same time the interest of a large  number of individuals in close touch with the business and professional world  is  directly awakened, and, in many cases,  vacancies are consequently placed at the disposal  of the Department.   In a task where success so largely depends on. the confidence of employers, such aid should prove of the greatest value.     The ground had already  Jpeen partially prepared for a  general development of  this nature.  In one  Directorate, for example, the Interviewing Boards dealing with candidates for training made it a rule to deal at each of  their meetings with a certain number of candidates for appointments whose cases  had proved especially difficult for the Depart- ment to handle.   In other Directorates  members  of the Interviewing Boards for training allowed candidates to receive  personal introductions to them,  and made it their business in many cases to find appointments.   Some of  the District  Selective  Committees  had appointed  small sub-committees  to deal with the appointments problem.   A general appeal lias been made to the  District Selective Committees to develop this side of their work.   No attempt,has been made to enforce  a hard-and-fast  system.   Appointments Interviewing Boards  are now at work in most of the Directorates.   Some  5,400 can- candidates have  already been  interviewed,  with  the result that nearly 860  have been found  posts  through the agency  of  the  Boards.  About  630 have  been rejected as not suitable for such positions as come within the scope  of the Department.  In a number of cases special,  propaganda sub-committees have been set up to draw the attention of local employers to the position of affairs as regards ex-officers. -    With fit men already qualified, the Department has found little difficulty in dealing. It appears probable that the greater part  of the candidates now  on the books of  theDepartment are  either unable to follow  their pre-war calling, unfit, untrained, or trainedfor a profession  in which few openings  present themselves,  or are elderly men, such asregular officers  entering business  life for the  first time.   To  solve  the  problem  ofemployment for men in such a position is a task which requires an organised effort on  thepart of the whole business community.  The  formation of the Appointments Panels,which should shortly be completed, is intended to bring  such an effort into play.                   PART III-THE LABOUR AND SOCIALIST PRESS.The Paisley By-Election.    The Paisley by-election has aroused as much interest before the nomination of the candidates as the Spen Valley election did after the declaration of the result.  The wholeLabour and  Socialist  press (with  the  exception of the &quot; New Statesman &quot;  and the&quot; Nation &quot;) join in opposing the candidature of Mr. Asquith.  The &quot; New Statesman &quot;confines itself to analysing  the implications of  Mr.  Asquith&apos;s declaration  on the Irish
issue in his opening speech at Paisley, and the &quot; Nation &quot; offers Mr. Asquith advice onthe position he should take up on foreign  affairs.   The other papers, and especially theJ.L.P. papers, contain a series of indictments of Mr. Asquith&apos;s past conduct from  such people as Mr. Snowden, Mr. J. King, Mr. R. Maoddnald, Sir Leo Money, Mr. R. B. Suthers,Mr. E. D. Morel and &quot; Rob Roy &quot; (in &quot; Forward &quot;).  These articles, with few exceptions,deal with Mr. Asquith&apos;s conduct of foreign affairs, both before and during the war.   SirLeo  Money&apos;s article in &quot; Forward &quot; is the only noteworthy one  that deals with domesticmatters.  Sir Leo expresses the opinion that much more trust may be placed by labour in an administration controlled by the present Prime Minister than in one controlled byMr.  Asquith.  He confesses that the only reason for his  long adherence to the liberal party was his  hope.that the Prime  Minister might convert that Party to a belief incollectivism.  Mr. Asquith, lie believes, is a convinced individualist, and on this groundhe recommends the electors of Paisley to give him no support.   These  articles were, ofcourse, written before Mr. Asquith&apos;s election address was made  public, and references tospeeches delivered at Paisley are scanty.The Labour Movement.     An article which appeared in the &quot; Nation &quot; last week on the future of the labour movement, with special reference to the part that might be played in it by non-working class  leaders, receives this  week the enthusiastic endorsement of the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot;The  &quot; Nation &quot; article was  (apart from the  enunciation of a few historical truisms) in factbased upon the  discussion  by the &quot; New Statesman &quot; in  the preceding fortnight of theneed  for the Labour Party to free  itself  from  trade union  control.  That this articleshould be given so much prominence in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; while the &quot; New States-man &quot; articles were ignored, is an interesting illustration  of  the rapprochement that hastaken place in recent years between the  &quot;  Nation &quot; and the I.L.P.  It was noted above that the &quot; Nation &quot; is at one with the I.L.P. papers in considering Mr. Asquith&apos;s candidatureat Paisley from the point of &quot;view of foreign affairs.   On the other hand, the claim of the&quot; Labour Leader &quot; for support for Mr. Biggar on the ground of his long membership ofthe I.L.P., may be contrasted with the disparaging reference of the &quot; New Statesman  &quot; :-&quot; The Labour candidate is not a trade unionist but a co-operator, whose name has hitherto&apos;been unknown, outside Paisley, even in the Labour movement.&quot;   The divorce between theorgan of the Fabian Society and the organ of the I.L.P. is  becoming very marked.Government Policy.    The &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinks that opinion has hardened against the UnemploymentInsurance  Bill,  which the  Minister introduced into  the House of Commons on the23rd  December.  This paper states  that  any form  of contributory insurance is funda-mentally unsatisfactory, and that the provisions in the Bill for the formulation of special schemes for particular industries are too inadequate to carry  out the principle that  each industry must bear the cost of its own unemployment.   This journal suggests that theLabour Party should put forward an alternative Bill.  Mr. J.  C. Wedgwood discusses this bill in &quot; Forward &quot;  and outlines its main provisions very fairly,  except for his statement that by it an insured contributor will be disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit by reason of a trade dispute, not necessarily in his own trade.  Mr. Wedgwood, however,argues that the Bill is no solution of the unemployment problem, in that it does nothing to prevent  unemployment.  From  the  assumption  that unemployment  is considered necessary  to the existence of capitalism, he argues that the object of the Bill isvto ensurethe continuance  of unemployment by making it  tolerable.   Mr. Wedgwood suggeststhat the first step in a policy aimed at removing unemployment should  be the freeing ofthe land from capitalist monopoly, apparently by means of a land values tax.     The &quot; New  Statesman &quot;  discusses the &quot; Manchester Building Guild Committee &quot;proposals.  The opinion of this paper is that the proposals are essentially analogous tothose made by the miners  for the future control of their industry.  &quot; The nation&apos;s  needfor houses provides the building workers with an unparalleled  opportunity to carry thepublic with them in their  demand for the  reorganisation of  the building industry  on  a real  basis of public service.&quot;Wages and the Cost of Living.     The provision in the agreement between the N.U.R.  and the Ministry of transport for variation in wages according to the movement of the &quot;  Labour Gazette &quot; cost of living index number aroused in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; much discussion  of the principle involved.This  discussion was  reflected to a certain  extent last week in the Labour and Socialist.
  press.   This week the &quot; Railway  Review &quot; promises a full  discussion of the  matter in  its own columns.  A beginning is made by Mr.  C. T. Cramp, who advances arguments  similar to those put forward by Mr. R. B. Suthers last week in the &quot; Clarion.&quot;  Mr. Cramp  states  that  he has always been in  favour of  a  sliding scale.  He points  out that  the  acceptance of the sliding scale principle makes  it possible for the trade unionists to fight  directly for increases in real wages.  Past struggles for increases in money wages he regards  as wasted energy.  It may be noted that Mr. Cramp does not commit himself to any opinion  on the details of the sliding scale contained in the railway agreement.  He gives, however,  a catalogue  of commodities Avhich he thinks should be  considered in calculating an index  number.   This list is: Fuel, rent,  clothing,  food, education, amusement,  etc.  The  leading article in the &quot; Railway Review &quot; on the railway agreement is dealt with in Part IV  of this Report.  Prices and Profiteeriny.      The storm in the daily press aroused by Mr.  W. Mackinder&apos;s allegations with regard  to the abnormal profits being made in the spinning processes  of the wool textile industry  has not noticeably extended  the  weekly Labour and Socialist press.   The &quot; Bradford  Pioneer &quot; is maintaining a running criticism of the local &quot; capitalist &quot; press, and is putting  forward vague suggestions for the nationalisation  of the wool trade.   Mr. R. B. Suthers,  in the  &quot; Clarion,&quot;  appeals  for the institution  of  a  standard clothing  scheme, but Mr.  Philip Snowden&apos;s opinion, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; that u  all  this  outcry  about wool  profits is. rather belated&quot; would seem to be generally shared by the contributors to&apos;these  periodicals.      &quot; The Call &quot; continues to show an exceptional interest in  currency questions.  Mr. A.  Barton discusses the proposal advanced recently in Wigan that  municipalities should be  empowered to issue currency notes in order that local  development schemes might  not  be hindered  by the payment  of interest on the capital employed.   This article contains  the astonishing statement that the  Treasury note issue is unsecured by any gold or other  backing.  In view of the general tenor of this article, it is difficult to  understand why-  &quot;  The Call&quot; prints in the same issue an article by Mr. J. Maclean, written in  his usual  manner, on the text &quot; Burn Bradbury.&quot;  Russia and Ireland.      Articles  appear in the &quot; Nation &quot; and  in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot;  on Russian policy, pointing out that the test of the current Allied policy towards  Russia will be found in the relations of the Allies with the Polish Government.  Both articles express a fear that attempts will be made to use the Polish  Government as a  successor to Denikin and  Koltchak, and that under cover of a plea  for the safety of  Poland,  allied troops may intervene in  Russian  affairs.   The  &quot; Nation &quot; also contains an article by M. Kerenski, in which he calls for the end of the alliance between the allied  Governments and the anti- Bolshevist leaders, the recall of allied political officers in Russia, a Parliamentary inquiry into English Russian policy and the removal of the blockade.  M. Kerenski fears that the governing purpose of allied policy may merely be the dismemberment of the Russian Empire, and, in opposition to the breaking up of the Empire into a number of  in- dependent states, he advocates its re-constitution upon a federal basis.     Mr. Phillip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; remarks that Sinn Fein leaders do not appear  to  have welcomed *the Labour Party  delegation with  much enthusiasm. He declares that the I.L.P. stands with regard to Ireland by the principle of self-determination, and trusts that the  instincts of the Irish people  will respond to this magnanimity.   The article in the  &quot; New  Statesman &quot; on the implications of the principle of self-determination-as  applied to  Ireland has been referred to above and is worthy of notice.                           PART IV. GENERAL TOPICS.The General Situation. .     The general labour situation at the moment is interesting and significant, not becauseof anything that has actually occurred during the week, but rather in view of what mayhappen in the near future.  The situation is, indeed, full of possibilities, but it is uncertainhow these will be realised.  A number of important matters are at present under discussion,and large issues appear to be growing ripe for decision.  Among these the most important is the nationalisation of the mines.  On this question no fresh developments have occurred
since last week, and although it still appears probable that the procedure outlined in lastweek&apos;s Report will be followed, the miners will not finally decide upon their policy until;after their interview with the Premier on the 5th February.  Important questions involvedin the inquiry under the  Industrial Courts Act into the wages and conditions of dock andwaterside labour are at present under review,  and in  the case of the railwaymen certain matters, especially in connection with the clerical and supervisory grades, are still being;negotiated  on.  In the cotton textile industry preparations are being made by the work-people for the presentation of large wage demands on  the expiration of the present agree-ment, in order that they may enjoy a greater share of the present prosperity of this industry..Thus, although at the moment the situation is peaceful  on the surface, it contains the threat of possible  trouble in the next month or two on a number of important issues.Survey of Industrial Disputes.     The history  of the  week, so  far as industrial  disputes  are concerned, has  beenuneventful.  Three small strikes of coal miners have taken place  in Welsh collieries, ineach case over some local grievance.  In one case the strike  was quickly settled, and inthe other two cases an amicable agreement may be  expected soon. Several other stoppageson a minor scale in various industries have taken place, but in no case is any considerableextension of &quot;the original dispute to be feared.  Of these strikes the most important arethose of London waiters  and  of the workers at the North Middlesex Gas Company.   Thestrike of employees of the Glasgow Subway Railway  Company continues in spite of theefforts of the Ministry to effect a settlement.  The Company maintain that their financialposition is  not such as to enable them to pay  the increases demanded, and at this pointnegotiations appear to have reached a deadlock.   Some small strikes  have been settledduring the week, and  a  tendency  is increasingly noticeable  to  refer  matters in dispute-to arbitration.The Unemployment Position.     Unemployment at the week ending the 23rd January .was considerably less acute-According to the live register of the employment exchanges, the reduction on the  totallive register in all departments was over 8,000 since the week ending the 16th January..The present live  register shows  501,020 men,  52,966 women and  29,477 juveniles-Employment has improved this week in the  building trades as well as in shipbuilding,engineering and ironfounding, iron and steel, etc.     The number of ex-Service men and. women on  out-of-work  donation at  the 23rdJanuary was 385,365,  of whom 40,620 were drawing  donation under  the special H.M.F.extension scheme.  This  is a reduction  of over 11,000  out-of-work donation policiescompared with the 16th January.     In  addition, 4,069 H.M.F. policies were lodged by short-time workers,  mainly in theengineering and ironfounding groups.  The number of short-time workers is also less thanat  the  previous week.  The  number of civilians on unemployment insurance  benefitat the 23rd January  was 135,636,  as compared  with 135,326  at week ending the 16thJanuary.The Nationalisation of the Mines.                               *     The campaign in favour of the nationalisation of the mines, which, as was stated lastweek, is to come to an end on the 8th february, continued during the week, but a smaller number of  meetings were held owing to the pre-occupation of  the leaders with conferences and other  matters.  Mr.  Frank Hodges, however, found time amid his other duties to speak at several meetings.  His main speech dealt chiefly with the possibility of economy in the use of coal when the  industry was nationalised.   The question of the procedure which the Labour movement will adopt to secure the nationalisation of the mines is arousing;a  great deal of interest, but the miners have not as yet committed themselves to any policy, though they have not given any indication that  Mr. Hodges&apos; recent  statement,which was mentioned last week, with regard to their future action would  be  falsified..At present, however, until the interviewr of the Parliamentary Committee of the TradesUnion Congress  and the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain with, thePrime Minister with regard to nationalisation, which is to take place on the  5th February,no definite policy had been formulated.The Miners&apos; Federation.     A special conference of miners&apos; delegates  was held on the 29th January to hear thereport of the Executive with regard to its interview with the Prime Minister, an account
 -of which was given in last week&apos;s Report, and a resolution was adopted postponing dis- cussion of the matters at issue until after the next interview  with the  Prime Minister. The conference then  proceeded to discuss questions relating  to  week-end  work  and overtime, and payment at the rate of one shift-and-a-fifth  for each shift  worked  on afternoon and night shifts,  on the ground of the inconvenience involved in the working of these shifts.  It Avas decided that the Government should be asked to  provide for a general unification of overtime rates both for compulsory week-end work and for overtime work by every class  of workman  both underground and surface during the week.  But it was decided not to press at the present time the question of the payment of a shift-and- a-fifth for each shift worked on afternoon and night shifts.      The important  question of the finance of the  Federation  was also discussed.  The Executive recently recommended to the districts that the contributions of members to the Federation funds should be increased to Is. per week, and in  a  statement to the districts Mr. Frank Hodges said: &quot; The requirements of the future industrially are uncertain, but this much can be stated, that, in our progress toAvards the unification of the present wage . system of the coalfields and in our  struggle for the national OAAmership of the collieries with Joint control by the Avorkers,  we may be involved in a national strike, and this in itself proves  the  necessity for increased  contributions.&quot;   According  to an official statement issued  at the close of the Conference, there Avas a  large majority  in favour of the increased subscription, but as a number  of districts &quot; could  not give  a  reply &quot; the question was postponed for final decision at the next conference.  This movement in favour of increasing the Federation funds is significant, not only as an attempt to strengthen the  position of the Federation in case of a  national strike, but also  as an instance  of the general policy of the  leaders of the Federation to increase the poAver of the central  authority over the districts.  Financially the Federation as the central authority  is  poor compared Avith some of its constituent associations.   Recent figures are not available, but at the end  of 1918, the total funds of the Federation and its constituent associations  amounted to  2,589,572,* of which sum the Federation fund  amounted to only  59,995.*  By reason of its financial Aveakness the Federation is prevented from taking a strong line on matters of policy without the concurrence of the district associations.  It may be recalled that  at the annual con- ference of the Federation at Keswick last year an. attempt Avas  made to secure authority for the  executive committee of the  Federation to  declare a strike Avithout taking  a ballot of the members, but in spite of the Avave of support that the policy of direct action enjoyed at that time, this proposal, which Avould have weakened the authority of the districts, was decisively rejected. The Railwaymen.     The railway world is not yet tranquil.   Some reflection of the frame of mind in which the railwaymen accepted the recent terms of the Government is afforded by an authoritative article in the current number  of the &quot; Railway Review.&quot;  It is there stated that those who  constituted the bare majority for  acceptance accepted the position in Avhich they found themselves  not because they  appreciated the offer, but rather  because  they con- sidered that  no other  practical course  AA^as  open to them.   The position, however, as described  by this  and  other  journals  probably  exaggerates the  dissatisfaction  of the raihvaymen from a feeling that  a  display of satisfaction Avould make, the submitting of future demands much more  difficult, if  such a course became desirable.  It is therefore stated that the greatest factor in favour of the acceptance of the  terms Avas the knowledge that the settlement  was not eternal, and the  difference between their demands and the offer  of the Government was left for future consideration.   With regard to the position of the clerical staffs, a further  conference took place  on the 2nd February between a sub-committee of the  General  Managers  and representatives  of  the Railway  Clerks&apos; Association and the National Union  of Railwaymen, to consider questions of detail with regard to  the new classification scheme for  railway clerks and other salaried officials. Considerable progress has been made, and the few outstanding points  will be dealt with on  the  9th February.   Although both Mr.  A. G.  Walkden and  Mr.  J. H. Thomas have expressed their satisfaction at the progress of negotiations, local  branches of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association continue to pass resolutions of protest against what they consider the inadequacy of the terms, and in the current issue of the &quot; Railway Review &quot; a long articleappears on the &quot; exasperation &quot;  of the railway clerk  at the delays which have occurredwith regard to the making effective of the August agreement,  and with the conditions ofthe agreement itself.  A certain amount of dissatisfaction is also  reported to exist among   * In some cases figures at the end of 1918 are not available, and in these cases the latest available figurehas been used.
 signalmen, and a mass meeting of London and suburban signalmen on the Great Eastern Railway held at Stratford recently demanded that before any scheme of classification is accepted by the Executive of the N.U.R., a national conference of signalmen should be held.  It is stated also that considerable dissatisfaction exists among the police employed by the different British railway companies in connection both with conditions of employ- ment  and the question  of status.  The men hold that they  are  classed neither as railwaymen  nor  as police officers, and that  they have  no recognised channel for the ventilation of their grievances. The Building Guild Movement.     The proposals of the Manchester Building Guild were laid before a mass meeting of the rank and file  of the building industry at Manchester  on the 1st February, and the meeting pledged  itself to give all the support it could to the undertaking,  and invited fellow craftsmen elsewhere to start local guild organisations and co-ordinate them with the Manchester effort.   Councillor Lewis  Watson, President of the Operative  Bricklayers&apos; Society, has been chosen  chairman of the  Building Guild Committee.  He maintained. at the mass meeting that the master builders as such were not wanted in the scheme, but, whilst they  Were useless  as  employers,  they could as experts be  usefully employed. Mr. S. G. Hobson,  Secretary of the  Committee, explained the proposals, and stated that with regard to finance the simplest way would  be that while the  Committee should mobilise the labour and build houses under  their own  direction and organisation, the Corporation itself  should purchase the materials needed.   The Committee  will lay their full proposals before the  Mam  Urban District Council on the  5th February, and they also intend to make an offer to the Manchester Corporation to build two thousand houses. The movement is  apparently spreading.  At Warrington  it has been decided to form a Guild  Committee to work in conjunction  with the parent committee at Manchester, and it is also stated that Bournemouth building  operatives have formed a Builders&apos; Guild which is about to  tender for the  hundred houses which the local corporation proposes to erect.   Mr.  G. D.  H. Cole, speaking on the 27th January,  enthusiastically supported the Manchester scheme, and announced that  the National Guilds&apos; League was. assisting the Committee with all the means in their power. Industrial Courts Act.     The Court of Enquiry under this Act into the  application by the  National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a standard minimum wage of 16s. per day and other alterations in the conditions.of employment of dock and waterside labour held  its first public sitting on the  3rd January, under the chairmanship of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline.  At the beginning of the sitting the London  Chamber  of Commerce and other bodies made application for leave to give evidence, and the chairman ruled that while the special applicants should be represented and might give evidence in exceptional cases, the inquiry was upon a specific issue remitted by the Ministry of Labour, and the Court was not to be held as encouraging in any respect the desire to broaden or lengthen it.   The rest of  the sitting was occupied with the opening  address, on behalf of the  dockers, of Mr. Ernest  Bevin.  Mr.  Bevin began  by pointing out that the claim was first submitted  to the employers last October, and that the  men had  exhibited great  patience  in  adopting  the  new  machinery of investigation.   His main arguments in favour of the increase were two.   He argued, in the first place,  that since the war wages had been  chasing the cost of living and had  never caught up with it, and insisted that the increase demanded was necessary if the dockers&apos; standard of life was to be  maintained.  In the second place, he stated that in the first 31 months  of the war the  ship-owners made a profit of  350,000,000, and suggested that those figures showed the falsity of the employers&apos; contention  that they were unable topay the increase without passing it on to the public.  The Court of Enquiry continues to sit. Amalgamation.     A movement is on foot for  the amalgamation of  various building trade unions in Scotland.   The Scottish Trades Union  Congress has called a conference with a view to amalgamation of the following unions: The Scottish Masons&apos;  Association,  the United Operative  Masons&apos;  and  Granite Workers&apos;  Union, the  Scottish  Associated  Paviors&apos; Federal Union (Glasgow),  the Furnace and Range Builders&apos;  Association,  and the Tile Fixers&apos; and Marble Workers&apos;  Association. A strong tendency has recently manifesteditself in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers in favour  of an amalgamation with the
  unions in the foundry trades, and it is reported that a majority of the London branches-  have passed resolutions calling on their executive to approach the unions definitely with  a view to amalgamation.  Trades Union Congress.      The Parliamentary Committee  of  the Trades  Union Congress is making its  annual  tour of the Government offices this  week in  order to lay before Ministers the resolutions  affecting their respective Departments  which were  adopted at the Glasgow Congress last  September.  This series of interviews  is invested  with special importance this year in  virtue of the great importance of the issues which are being raised, and the determination  with which the demands are being advanced.  On the 4th February the Ministry of Health  and the Home Office were visited, and the questions discussed were the housing problem,  the alleged inadequacy of the sickness and maternity benefits under the National Insurance  Acts, the more rigorous inspection of factories and workshops and the earlier closing of  shops.  On the 5th  February the  Committee  will intervieAV the Prime Minister, the  Minister of Labour and the  President  of the Board of Education. The most important  question to be discussed with, the Prime Minister is the problem of the nationalisation of  the mines.  Demands for the nationalisation of banking, shipping and  railways are also  being advanced, but these are of the nature  of formal resolutions and have no backing. Demands are also being advanced for the abolition of the poor law system, for pensions for mothers and for old  age pensions of   1 a week for all persons over sixty years Of  age. In its interview with the Minister of  Labour the Committee will raise the questions of the extension  of the Trade Board  system  and  the enlargement  of  the  inspectorate,  the administration of the Fair Wages  Clause and the question of the right to work or main- tenance.  On the 6th inst. the Committee will visit the Admiralty and the Board of Trade. Shop Assistants.     In connection with the recent movement of shop assistants for the improvement  of their wages and  conditions  of work, it may be noted  that representatives  from the National Amalgamated  Union of  Shop  Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks have been nominated  to  the deputation  of the  Parliamentary  Committee  of  the  Trade  Union Congress, which  will interview the Home Secretary and the  Minister of Labour.   The deputation  to the Minister of Labour will draw attention  to the desirability of promptly establishing a Trade  Board for the distributive trades in view of the.low wage standard which prevails, and will  urge the necessity of setting up a prescribed rate for women shop assistants pending the establishment  of the Trade Board. Electrical Power Engineers&apos;  Association.     It  is reported that the  Electrical  Power Engineers&apos; Association,  which,  organises electrical superintendents on the railways as well as in other undertakings, has  under Consideration a  proposal to approach the Railway Clerks&apos;  Association with a  view to arriving at  an agreement under which its railway members would, be members of both associations.. Under  this agreement the  Power  Engineers&apos;  Association would pay  the railway  clerks a  lump sum equivalent  to the Railway Clerks&apos; Association  contribution in  respect of each member, and.  the Railway Clerks&apos; Association would undertake to safeguard the interests of the power engineers in railway negotiations. Hours of Employment (No. 2) Bill.     A conference of representatives of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation and of the employers in the industry  was held,  on  the 27th January to discuss this Bill.  It was decided to adjourn the conference until the new Bill was introduced next session, as it was expected that  it might differ  in some respects from  the Bill introduced  last year. The campaign for the inclusion of seamen in the provisions of  this Bill continues, and  a recent meeting at Bristol passed a strong resolution in favour of their inclusion. Reinstatement of the Police.     A deputation of  mayors of thirteen London Borough Councils was received on the 28th January by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs.  The deputation requested the reinstatement of  the  police who  were dismissed on  the occasion of the police strike inAugust.  Mr. W. H.  Girling,  Mayor  of Shoreditch,  headed the deputation.  The HomeSecretary stated that the  Government  adhered  to its decision not to  reinstate the strikers.The Mayors of Betlmal Green and  Poplar protested  against this decision, and the latter
-announced that his Council would refuse to pay the police rate.   The Lambeth Borough Council has since decided to refuse  payment  of the rate as a protest against the Home Secretary^ decision.   The Bristol District  Committee of the National Society of Painters has passed a resolution demanding the reinstatement of the strikers and the repeal of the Police Act, and agreeing to use every endeavour to see that these demands are complied with at an early date. Ex-Service Men.     Officers&apos;  A.ssociaiion.-Th&amp; policy of amalgamating ex-Service associations has made a notable advance in the formation of the Officers&apos; Association, which is the fruit of the efforts of a committee appointed in August,  1919, under the chairmanship of  Earl  Haig by representatives of roughly  50 organisations  which  have come  into existence to assist ex-Officers.  The Officers&apos;  Association was  publicly  inaugurated at a  Mansion House meeting  held on the  30th  January,  when its three Presidents, Earl Beattie,  Earl  Haig and Sir H. Trenchard, representing the three Services, made an appeal for financial support to the extent of  500,000 a year.  The Association desires ultimately to become a general association of ex-Service men of all ranks.   Unity among officers&apos;  organisations is the first practical stage in this development,  and at the  present time the Association  holds that the need of the officer is greater than  that of  other ranks.  Its immediate  aims, therefore, are two-fold :  (1)  The protection  of the interests and the promotion of the welfare of all ex-Officers and their dependents, and (2) the relief of present distress among disabled  and necessitous ex-Officers.  The Association has already been invited to assume responsibility for carrying on the work lately done by the King&apos;s Fund.   Its first task is to ensure economic working by eliminating the multiplicity of committees dealing with the  problem of the  ex-officer.  Policy is to  be determined by the three presidents, supported by the  Council  and Executive Committee.   Under the Executive Committee will be four  groups dealing with (1) employment,  (2) housing, (3) families and (4) disable- ment.  It is strongly emphasised that the efforts of  the Association will be directed to assisting the Government, not to relieving it of  its responsibilities.      United Services Fund. At a meeting of ex-Service men  held  at Cotteridge on the 29th  January to formulate a  scheme for the expenditure of the money allotted to the men from the United Services Eund, and to appoint a committee and officials in  connection therewith, a Committee of 12  was appointed, comprising four representatives of the National Federation  of  Discharged and  Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, four repre- sentatives   of  the  Comrades of  the  Great  War,  and  four  representatives of the National Association of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors, and it was decided to recommend provision for educating the children of ex-Service men  by the establishment of scholarships . and training in arts and crafts by means of an apprenticeship system.
