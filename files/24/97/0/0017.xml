[This Docameiic is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.^             Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1920.REPORT  ON  THE SITUATION  IN  SOUTH RUSSIA  BY              SIR H. MACKINDER,  M.P.To the Right Honourable    Earl Curzon of Kedleston, P.C., K.G.,             His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary                       of State for Foreign Affairs.(No. 1.)My Lord,                  H.M.S.  &quot; Centaur,&quot; off Marseilles, January 21, 1920.,    I BEG leave to present to your Lordship my promised report on the situation inSouth Russia.  I hope and believe that I am now in possession of all the larger factsessential to a judgment on the position.  Undoubtedly I should have preferred to spend a few  more  weeks in the country before giving an opinion, but the time iscritical, and I think that His Majesty&apos;s Government will desire to have my views atonce, now that I see them in broad outline, since it is obvious that a policy should beadopted and decisions taken with as little delay as possible.My Journey.    After interviews in London with all persons I could hear of with special know-ledge of Russia, I left England on the 4th December and went to Paris.  There I sawfour members of the All-Russia  Council MM.  Sazonof, Maklakof, and  Savinkof,and Prince Lvof.   I had seen the fifth member, M. Chaikovsky, in London.  I alsomet M. Yaroshinsky, and  I  had an interview with the Polish representative, M.Dmowsky.  I had  conversations with General Spear, Colonel Kish, Mr. Carr, andothers.  Brigadier-General Keyes joined me  on the 8th December, and we left Parison the 10th December and arrived at Warsaw on the 13th December, where I wasentertained by our Minister, Sir Horace  Rumbold.   In company  with  Sir  H.Rumbold and General Keyes I had a long and satisfactory interview with  GeneralPilsudsky, the President of the Polish Republic, particulars of which have been givenin telegrams  from  Sir Horace Rumbold (Appendix A).  I had two long interviews with M. Paderewsky, and  I talked with General Carton de Wiart, the Head of our military Mission, and with Colonel Young, our representative at Kovno  in lithuania-Stefania.   I also  had a conversation with Baron Ropp,  the Roman Catholic archbishop of Petrograd, in regard to the present situation in Soviet Russia.  I append a memo-randum on this interesting conversation (Appendix C).    I left Warsaw on the 17th December in General Pilsudsky&apos;s railway saloon, afortunate compliment paid to me, for the journey was very slow, the conditions werebarbaric, and there were temperatures of 40 degrees of frost.   I  travelled throughLemberg and  Czernovitz to Bucharest, where I arrived on the 21st December, and wasthe guest of Mr. Rattigan, our Charge  d&apos;Affaires.  There I had an interview withM. Vaida. the new Prime Minister.  From what I learned, both from Mr. Rattiganand Mr. Madge, I  came to the conclusion that an early change of  Government was likely,  and  that it  was not desirable to enter into serious  discussions with  merelyinterim Ministers.   Mr. Madge informed me that he had had conversations both with M. Manu and  General Averescu, which led him to believe that on the resumptionof the sittings of the Roumanian Parliament  at the end of January a strong coalition government would  be formed.   I therefore decided to proceed on my journey withoutdelay.  Before leaving I telegraphed to Constantinople to ask. General Greenly,  theChief of our Military Mission at Bucharest,  to await my arrival.   I understood thatGeneral Greenly had left Bucharest  with the object of Visiting General Denikin, to try and arrange matters between the Roumanian and South Russian Governments.I felt that it  was desirable that such questions should be  reserved for considerationby me.    I left Bucharest on the 23rd December, and arrived at Sofia on the 24th.  there dined with  General Baird, the Chief of our Military Mission, who took me to visit the King.  I  had a long conversation with  His  Majesty, who is a very intelligentyoung man, and popular, I understand, in Bulgaria.&quot; He lent me his private saloonfor the journey to  Constantinople, and again it was fortunate that this particular      [2125]                                                         B
compliment was paid, for  I  passed the twenty-four hours of  Christmas Day inPhilippopolis Station, owing to a strike on the railway.     I arrived in Constantinople only on the 28th December.   There I met Admiralde Kobeck, General Milne,  Admiral Webb, and Mr. Hohler.   It was reported thatGeneral Denikin&apos;s retreat continued and that it was likely Odessa would be aban-abandoned.  At their urgent instance I joined Admiral de Robeck and General Milne in pressing that, if possible, Odessa should not be abandoned, in view of the very difficult problems which were likely to be raised by the crowd of refugees.  M. Stcherbatsky,the Russian  Minister, called on me.  I also had conversations with M. Bilinsky,probably the best-known financial authority in this part of the world, and with Mr.Dickson, the  manager of the British Trade Corporation.   A memorandum from Mr.Dickson is attached  (Appendix  D 2).   In view of a message brought by destroyerfrom Odessa, I agreed with Admiral de Robeck to send one of my staff, Captain Hill,to ascertain the position in  that city, and Captain Hill reported to me afterwards by telegram at frequent intervals.  Just before leaving Constantinople I had a conversa-tion with the French Admiral de Bon,  who had been with General Denikin ten dayspreviously.   The Admiral  told me that in his opinion  General  Denikin  was doing the right thing in ordering  the present retreat,  and that Denikin agreed that a mistake had been made in advancing so far and so rapidly during the past summer.     I left  Constantinople on the evening of the 30th December in the battleshipH.M.S.  &quot; Marlborough,&quot; under the command of Captain  Johnson, and  arrived atNovorossisk on New Year&apos;s  Day.  The &quot; Marlborough  also gave passages  to GeneralGreenly,  who joined me at Constantinople, and to the  Russian  General  Heroy.  I took the opportunity of talking with General Heroy, a trustworthy friend,  I was told,of the Allies, in the hope that he might break the ice for me  with General Denikin,and this hope was fulfilled.    At Novorossisk I found  Mr. Wardrop, who came into port an hour before mein H.M.S. &quot; Calypso  &quot; from Batoum.  He spent the day with me, and we discussed the position in Transcaucasia,   Mr. Wardrop  represented that  position  as steady,and the two republics of Georgia and Azerbaijan as reasonably well established andon good terms with one another.  I asked him whether, in the event of Bolshevismsweeping forward to the northern foot  of the Caucasus, he thought that Georgia andAzerbaijan would stand firm.  He replied that under such circumstances he couldnot be quite sure.   Mr. Wardrop agreed to keep in communication with me, and left in the evening by the &quot; Calypso &quot; for Batoum.    On the same day Baron Nolkin came off to the ship with a telegram from general denikin to me, in which Denikin welcomed me, but said that, owing to the positionof affairs at the front and the congestion of traffic on the railways, he could not forthe  moment meet  me.  On  the  2nd January I had a discussion with CommanderWatson on the position of Denikin&apos;s flotilla in the Caspian.  Watson was with thatflotilla as late as the end of  September,  and struck me as a man of good judgment.    I remained in the &quot; Marlborough &quot; until the 7th, when I  succeeded in obtainingsuitable quarters on  shore  and landed.   On the  same day I had  long  talks  withM. Neratof, the Under-Minister for Foreign Affairs, and with Mr. Harold Williams,the well known English authority on  Russia,  M.  Neratof had  been sent down byGeneral Denikin to arrange for my journey up-country, and Mr. Williams had justcome down from Rostov.    On the  8th January  I  left  Novorossisk by  rail  and  arrived next day atEkaterinodar, and thence  proceeded to Tikhoretskaya Junction, the headquarters at the moment of General Denikin. There I at last succeeded in meeting GeneralHolman.  I had a long interview with  General Denikin, and discussed with him thewhole situation (Appendix B 1).  The position at the  front was at its worst,  andthe Green Guards, who were  derailing trains every other day on the section of theline  between Novorossisk and Ekaterinodar, had cut the telegraph wires behindus.   The officers of the Volunteer  army were in danger of becoming  demoralised,because of  concern for  the fate of their wives and families.  The rumour had beenspread that the British Military Mission was about to leave the country, and Russianofficers were beginning to fly to the help of their families.   Under the circumstances felt that  I  was justified, at the urgent instance of General Holman, in  promisingon behalf of His Majesty&apos;s  Government that the wives and families of officers wouldbe removed by us,  if and when  the necessity arose, and that the British military mission would be their rearguard (Appendix E).  This was done to arrest the panic,for most certainly all these  women would be murdered if they fell into the hands of&apos;the Bolsheviks. I  felt that it was unthinkable that we should abandon them after
 having encouraged  their husbands to fight.   I need hardly add that  the private soldiers ran no similar risk, since they and their families could disappear into the general population.     I left Tikhoretskaya on the 10th of January, after further talk with General Holman,  and arrived back next day at Ekaterinodar.   There  I made acquaintance with General Vrangel.  I was delayed at Ekaterinodar for twenty-four hours, owing to the derailment of a train in the hills by  the Green  Guards.  Twenty thousand refugees were living around me in railway carriages in the station of Ekaterinodar. On the morning of  the 11th January General Vrangel  took my car on to his train and I proceeded under the  shelter of his Cossack guard and a score of British bayonets.&apos; General Percy went with me to take charge  of the base of our Military Mission at Novorossisk.     I arrived back  in Novorossisk  on the evening of  the 12th January.   The next day I had further interview with General Vrangel, and on the 14th  a meeting of General Denikin&apos;s Ministry was held in my house.  There were present General Lukomsky, M. Krivoshein, M.  Bernatsky, and  M. Fenin.   I  was accompanied  by General Keyes.   The Ministers spent the greater part  of the day with me.  General Lukomsky brought an important telegram from General Denikin (Appendix  B 2). This telegram  concedes  the  matter  for which I had struggled  in  vain  with M. Sazonof.   M. Sazonof, and indeed General Denikin himself,  had up to this point based their whole policy on the  idea of &quot; La Russie integrale,&quot; including the border peoples.  It  will be  seen that by this telegram  General  Denikin has abandoned his non possumus attitude, which  rendered negotiations  with  Poland impossible, and has agreed that the eastern frontier  of Poland shall be  determined on ethnographical grounds.  As dictator he has also  now definitely accepted the principle of a con- stituent assembly to be elected by  the Russian people  proper, and  of  subsequent negotiations  with the de facto  Governments of the Border States, the Allies  to  be parties to these negotiations.  I believe, therefore, that there is  now a fair prospect of  fruitful negotiations between General Denikin and  General Pilsudsky, and  of joint operations against Bolshevik Russia.  I annex a further document handed to me by General Lukomsky at the conclusion of our negotiations (Appendix D 1).     At this  time I was receiving copies of a number of telegrams to the Foreign Office, sent by Mr. Wardrop and Mr. Stokes.  It appeared that, on his return  to Tiflis, from visiting me, Mr. Wardrop was suddenly faced with the very contingency to which I had drawn his attention.  There is  now evidently danger  of revolution in Transcaucasia.     I had many minor interviews,  at various times and places, which I  need not enumerate, though they contributed to my understanding of the problem before me. I may, however, mention an important deputation from the British  Traders in South Russia which I received at Novorossisk.  I annex statements which they presented to me (Appendix D 3, 4, 5).     In view  of the urgency of  the whole situation and the need of formulating an all-round policy, I now determined to run home for a few days, and I asked Admiral Hope to give  me a passage in a destroyer, so that I might consult with your Lordship and place my promised  Report  in the hands of  the Cabinet.   I left Novorossisk on the 16th January in  H.M.S.  &quot;Speedy,&quot; and  General Keyes remained in  charge of the Mission.   Just before leaving I heard of the recognition of the de facto, Govern- ments of Georgia and Azerbaijan.  I would like, at this point,  to express my deep obligation to  General Keyes for his loyal and invaluable  help.    While crossing the  Black  Sea in rough weather  I exchanged  signals  with General Milne, who  was proceeding  in H.M.S. &quot; Benbow &quot; to Novorossisk.   At&apos; Constantinople on the 17th January I saw the Acting High Commissioner, Admiral Webb, and learnt of  the developments in the general situation round the Black Sea during my comparative isolation  in South Russia.  Of! Tenedos  I  left H.M.S. &quot;Speedy &quot; for H.M.S. &quot; Centaur,&quot;  and off Mytelene on the 18th January I had a couple of hours with Admiral de Robeck in H.M.S. &quot; Iron  Duke,&quot; and  exchanged information with him.Some Leading Men.    The personalities of a very few men are among the  determining factors in the russia of to-day.  Except in regard to the two armies and the Bolshevik propagandaalmost all organisation has disappeared, and there is, therefore, little scope for minorpersonal forces.   It is said that if five or six men were to be removed the Bolshevik      [2125]                                                        B 2
  terror would end.  In South Russia also there are a few men on whom everything  depends.   It seems to me important that the personalities of three of them should  be, appreciated.      1.  General Denikin. I spent five hours with General Denikin in his railway  train at Tikhoretskaya Junction on the 10th January.  The towns of Rostov and  Novocherkassk had just fallen,  and enemy cavalry had crossed the mouth of the Don  on the  ice.  But the General was quite calm, was at times even humorous, could  concentrate his mind on the political questions which were engaging  us,  and only  once or twice had he to glance  at papers which were brought to him.  In short, the  Commander-in-chief and  his immediate surroundings were wholly aloof  from the  prevailing panic.      General Denikin is a man  of medium height, stout in build, but not corpulent,  with a broad face and bald head, except for hair over the ears, and humorous grey  eyes.  His moustache and short pointed beard are grey.  In conversation he says little,  but I am told he is capable  of oratory of no mean order. He has a clear mind and  will listen to argument, but knows no language but his own, and no other country,  and  is somewhat innocent in matters of  economic and civil administration.  He is  absolutely straight, and his loyalty to his friends is such that it amounts to a failing.  At the  same  time  he is  shrewd  and  acute.  While  I was  talking with  him  (Appendix B 1) it was urged that he should appeal to the  Cossacks: he did not  accept the idea, and  even objected to it, but in the evening, after I had left him, he  sent me a message to the effect that he had appointed the Ataman of the Don  Cossacks  to be his First  Minister!   I have  no  doubt that he had made the offer before our conversation, but said nothing because he had not received the Ataman&apos;s acceptance.  This move on his part anticipated and probably nullified an  intrigue which was on foot among some of the younger officers  for the purpose of forcing his  resignation. General Keyes  has told me of  a similar swift and  silent  decision on a  previous occasion. Denikin was informed of a movement to put General Vrangel  in his place. He made no reply at the time, but shortly afterwards it was announced that General Vrangel had been appointed to the Command of the Caucasian army, on the extreme right of the line, a command which removed him from the centre of things and from the possibility  of mischief.  Denikin  is both stubborn and idealist; it  is this combination, of qualities and his loyalty of nature which  constitute his strength, but render him somewhat difficult to deal with.  He was asked, for instance, by General Holman to  blow up  the  Rostov Bridge when the enemy  was advancing, and General  Holman offered to take an armoured  train forward, and to do the thing himself,  but Denikin refused. He said that the bridge belonged to Russia; that he was advised that in the present  state of the world it would take two or three years to make  the damage good, and that the people of Central Russia would require the food of the Kuban. His one political ideal has been to maintain the unity of Russia, that unity being interpreted territorially as being within the pre-war  limits.  He thought of the Constituent Assembly promised to the Allies by Admiral Koltchak as being elected from all Russia including  all the border peoples.  Autonomy was to be granted to the borders by the majority in the Assembly with whatever limitations that majority might decide.  For this idea of the All-Russia  he has considered himself a trustee, so that he was not free to negotiate in regard to modifications of frontier.  It was evidently  at the cost of a great effort  that  he faced  the present situation/and told me that he would accept the responsibility of making a decision now if, after a  little  thought, he came to the conclusion  that it was  for the future good of Russia.   The tragedy of the past six months is partly due to the fact that, although he has  some good generals around him, and himself inspires confidence and even worship, most of his civilian advisers are so inferior that there seems to be no one to whose advice he will listen.  Once after a six hours Economic Conference he quietly remarked &quot; Gentlemen, you  have  wasted my time.&quot;    2. General  Vrangel. General Vrangel has at times been put forward as the rival of General  Denikin.  He is  a striking and distinguished figure.  Tall, slim, and erect, he would  look almost gaunt in. civilian clothes,  but wears a most becoming Cossack General&apos;s uniform.  His head is shaven and his look direct.  He speaks with a loud voice, and is said at times to drink, and I should think could be tactless, but he is an intelligent man, with  a wider range of ideas than  Denikin.   He is,. however,  vain and ambitious,  and allows his ambition to appear.  Undoubtedly he isthe best organiser among Denikin&apos;s Generals; the Caucasian army is-the only group in the Volunteer  army whose discipline has risen to the Western level. He is admired by the younger officers.   At  one time he  was attracted by the idea  of  turning to
Germany, especially when he was swept with disgust at what he regarded as theAllied desertion implied in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speeches, but he has now for the timebeing been subdued by Denikin, and has again come to see that England and notGermany can give Russia her chance.   General VrangeFs difference with general denikin is in part due to the fact that Denikin sticks to General Romanovsky, theChief of his Staff, who is very generally criticised, and Romanovsky and Vrangel areenemies.  I took an opportunity of saying to. General Vrangel that, while I had no right to intervene in the  internal-affairs of General Denikin&apos;s army,  yet I must say to him that if there were dissension it would tell  against the Russian cause in theWest.   General Vrangel admitted that a deputation had visited him, but assuredme &quot;As a gentleman  and a Russian &quot; that he had joined Denikin for the sake ofRussia, and though he had  had differences with  him on matters of strategy and policy, yet he would neither act against him nor desert him.  He added that he wasoften described as pro-German and autocratic; on the contrary he  could read thesigns of the times and he fully accepted my idea of a &quot; modern &quot; government andadhered  to the  Allies.     3. M. Krivoshein. M.  Krivoshein  was  Minister  of the Interior under  theCzardom, but he is not  a man of narrow views.   At the last moment before theRevolution the late  Czar  invited him to be Prime Minister.  The difference is greatbetween  him and Sazonof; both of them have wide and metropolitan  experience,whereas the other politicians round Denikin are merely  provincial; but Krivosheinperceives the change wrought by the war and  has an elastic mind, whereas Sazonofhas a quite ossified mind. Krivoshein is a man of dignified presence of a  definitelycivilian type. Prom the message sent me by Denikin (Note to Appendix B 1) I gatherthat the General is beginning to realise that Krivoshein is essential to him.  above all it is necessary to get a capable  civilian element into this Government of Generalsand  Cossacks.The Reasons of the Failure of the  Recent Advance on Moscow.     The advance on Moscow of the past summer and autumn was in the nature of agreat adventure. This was the term applied to it in conversation with me by GeneralPilsudsky, the Polish President, who  has an  uncanny fellow-Slavonic insight intothe realities of  the  Russian  position.   I  attribute the failure of that adventure to three minor and one major reason.     1. Military Reason. So  far as the front line was concerned, the campaign wasa co-ordinated military operation and might have succeeded.  The two flanks, in thedirection of Tsaritsin and Kief, made good and to the end resisted all attack.  Thefailure occurred principally in the army which stood third from, the right of the fourarmies.   This  Third Army was under the command of an old but capable general,Maimaievsky.  When he had advanced as far as Kharkof, the strain of the campaignbecame too much for him, and he gave way to drink.  He should have been removed,but the Chief of Staff, Romanovsky, stuck to him.   The Third Army advanced as faras Orel, the general  drinking, and his officers  gradually becoming demoralised.Unfortunately,  it was precisely upon this army that the weight of the Red attackfell, when Red reinforcements could be spared owing to the defeats of Koltchak and&quot;Yudenitch.  Maimaievsky&apos;s failure involved the retirement, and in the end the defeat of the whole of the Denikin army.  When  it  was too  late, General Vrangel was brought from the Caucasian  army to  relieve Maimaievsky, and Vrangel&apos;s conductduring the last three months of the retreat enhanced his reputation.     2. Moral Reason. It is  not  part of my functor, to criticise our own PrimeMinister.  He has to consider not) merely Russia, but also the condition of opinion inthe whole world, and especially in ouir own country.  But when the Prime Ministerreceived me, before  I left England, he asked me to speak without fear of any manwhen I came to express my opinions formed during the Mission.  I  am, therefore,bound to say that the  two speeches which Mr. Lloyd George made  at the Guildhalland  immediately afterwards in Parliament, when interpreted in Russia by skilfulpropaganda, did most certainly produce the impression that  England intended to change  her policy and abandon the anti-Bolshevik cause.    Excerpts  from thesespeeches, carefully edited, began to make their effect  felt just  at  the moment ofdiscouragement, when the turn of  the tide had taken place.  It is difficult for people in England to realise the power in Russia just now of the spoken word, for good orfor bad, of our great British leader.  It must  be remembered that you have here, as general Denikin reminded me, not regular armies of the Western type, but militias
and local levies,  which sweep forward and backward, and gather and dissolve, andare inspired or depressed with volcanic suddenness.    3. Administrative  Reason.-Oi  deeper import, however, than  any militaryinefficiency or any discouragement due to the speeches of the powerful, was the failure to organise in rear of the advancing line, alike in military, economic,  and adminis-trative matters.  The body responsible for such organisation was the Special Council.It consisted  of  about twenty-five members, Ministers and  others.   The SpecialCouncil spent its time debating the whole future of Russia, and whether the principleof her organisation should be Central or Federal.   General Denikin, as  Dictator,dissolved this futile body when the retreat was  already passing into panic.    i. Economic Reason. The three causes above described all had their influence in bringing about the defeat, but the principal cause of the greatness of the disasterlay, I am convinced, in the fact that from lack qf all financial resources the Denikinarmy had  to live on the country.   It  was welcomed with  flowers  when it firstadvanced, but gradually it  came to be  hated  by the people  hardly less than theBolsheviks, because  of its  excesses.  The  Cossacks  were undoubtedly the chiefoffenders, for they not only made levies on the country without paying for  them, butalso looted  on a  large scale, so that it is said, perhaps with exaggeration, that afterMamonto-f&apos;s brilliant raid behind the Bolshevik line, the train of wagons filled withloot extended to 80 versts.   The Cossacks were employed under the Czardoim forpunitive expeditions, and the poor people who suffered under Mamontof  asked whatthey had done that they were punished.   Moreover, the  peasants are no more ablethan under the Bolsheviks to  q,btain manufactured articles  in exchange  for theirproduce. The universal cry, except among those classes which  flourish on anarchy,is for order and the decencies of a civilised life.  If there is a  serious movement infavour of Germany, it is chiefly because  the Germans did  impose order and organiseadministration during the  months they  occupied the country.   As M. Neratof told me with evident conviction,  they are believed  still  to be powerful, having been defeated in an economic but not in a military sense.The Conditions within Soviet Russia.    It has often been asserted that the Germans are behind the Bolshevik policy, andthe younger officers in Denikin&apos;s army undoubtedly believe that Germany has only toutter the word and the Bolshevik advance would stop.   It may well  fee that thereare subterranean German agencies, probably through Jewish  channels, and thereis now much more definite  evidence than before that German soldiers of fortuneare obtaining  scope in the Bolshevik army, but I can obtain no mass  of evidencethat the German Government is at present directing Bolshevik policy.  (But seeAppendix F.)   This, however, does not affect  the  serious fact, which  has become very evident  during the recent  Bolshevik  advance, that the Bolshevik army is rapidly adopting German methods  of  fighting.   The well-authenticated story ofthe Denikinite nurse, in which house  a  number of  German officers lodged, may perhaps  be discounted  on  the  principle  that one swallow does  not  make  asummer, but  the  new  fire tactics,  the  new  strategy  of  attacking  at  thejoints between armies, the assaults just before dawn, and many other  phenomena,afford  conclusive  evidence  of  a  very  different  kind.   Thus   far  the  newefficiency has not reached the point that  the Bolshevik army could not be overthrownwith ease by a properly organised and sustained military effort on quite a moderatescale, but if that effort be not made within the next few months  there is undoubtedlygreat risk that such a weapon will be forged as may  become a danger to the world, inalliance, as it will be, overt or covert, with the Germans and the Turks.  It looks as though the time  when officers oif the old regime were made to command the  Bolsheviktroops the officers themselves being unarmed but accompanied by armed commissaries,were passing, and a new professional force, apparently highly paid, were in processof development.    Of the conditions behind the front  of the Bolshevik  army  it is very difficult togive any general description, not so much for the reason of our ignorance, as because there are very few general  statements,  other than negative, which can in truth bemade.   The most recent and authentic description  which I have had  was given mein an interview at Warsaw with the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Petrograd, BaronRopp, who was in Moscow as late as the 18th November (Appendix C).  &apos;    All the Archbishop said to me tallies entirely with what I have learnt since inSouth Russia, except that there are, of course, there the most terrible stories, only too
well  authenticated, of the cruelties perpetrated.    For  the  purpose of formingpolitical conclusions, however, these atrocities need not be too much dwelt upon.  Itis-quite likely that at times terrible vengeance has been taken by the Cossacks andeven by the Volunteer army.  What is to the point, however, is that the crueltiesnow  being  perpetrated by the Bolsheviks have  all the characteristics of thorough-going German &quot; frightfulness &quot;; they  are  a definite weapon of strategy.  Duringthe present advance the Bolshevik propaganda posted notices in the villages through which the Volunteer army retreated to the effect that whenever a village was foundto be without its proper complement of men the women and children would be killed.The  Russian loves his family  and home, and  desertion became rife.    When theretreat had extended as far as Rostov a panic seized the Volunteer officers, the reasonassigned being that they feared that their wives and children,  now refugees  movingback to the coast, would be massacred,  and  that the British Military Mission wouldsail  away and leave them to their fate.  It was obvious that propaganda had been at work, and to prevent a. total collapse I gave the guarantee of which I have  alreadyspoken.  General  Vrangel told me subsequently that this guarantee was having agreat effect.The Present Triumph of Bolshevism.     Bolshevism is for the moment triumphant.   The wheat and  coal areas of south russia are now accessible from Moscow, and Bolshevik tyranny has a new  lease of life.  That fact alone must encourage all the forces of disorder in the world.  Peacewith the Soviet at this moment would  be universally construed as a  decisive victoryfor Bolsehvism.     It might be quite possible at this  moment to make a  truce with the Bolsheviks.They were  very near  to military defeat last summer, and very near  to economiccollapse last autumn.  They have been saved almost by a miracle, and it.may be thatthey would come to terms with us.  That is the opinion of General Pilsudsky, but hesaid that &quot;he, for his part, would enter into no negotiations with them, for they hadnot  the smallest intention of keeping their promises.  There is also the risk that theywould use negotiations simply for the purpose of insulting what they describe as the &quot; Capitalistic Powers,&quot;  and by  way of super propaganda.    In either  case  their object would be to gain time for organisation and recuperation.     There  are indications of what would  be the nature of that organisation in its civil as well as military aspects.  Trotsky has in practice abandoned his communistic theories, and is now seeking to erect a  centralised and bureaucratic state of the same essentially socialistic character as the pre-war Prussia, but Jacobin instead of aristo- cratic.  General Denikin&apos;s Ministers gave me information concerning the activities of one Krasin, who before the war was the manager of the Russian Siemens Company. Krasin has been set as autocrat to control the economic organisation of Soviet Russia, including the railways.   Trotsky, who  now overshadows Lenin, rests on his army, and the economic life of the country is to be revived for the supply of that army.     Further, we must not forget the Bolshevik propaganda.  A  book such as Maxim Gorky&apos;s &quot; Dans le Peuple &quot; shows the beginning of that propaganda, its apprentice- ship in the years following the first revolution in 1905.  To-day  the propaganda is a distinctively Russian service with a tradition  which has grown and. strengthened gradually, just as the British  fleet and  the German army have been based on slowly developed traditions.  Unless destroyed at the root the Bolshevik propaganda may be a danger to all civilisation before long.   Its centre is a great office at Moscow, in the Kremlin I believe,  and it has a trained personnel  at  its disposal which is as efficient as the general staff of one of the great armies. The Need of an Alliance.      It is now obvious that the Denikin  Government alone cannot defeat Bolshevism, and that the method of mere.military  adventure  associated  with  the  names  of Koltchak, Yudenitch, and Denikin must be abandoned.  There must be substituted a system of alliances and of steady organisation pari  passu  with  limited  military advances.    General Vrangel said to me  that  it must  be by Slavonic  blood  that Moscow must be won.   He recognises that no British  or French invasion can be thought of. The Polish Republic and Serbian and Bulgarian Volunteers, on  the other hand, he  regards as in a different category.   The same view  is taken  in  General Denikin&apos;s telegram to me (Appendix B 2).
    In my conversation with General Eilsudsky it became clear that the position ofPoland was such that she must at the proper time throw her whole weight against theBolsheviks.  She cannot afford to rest between Germany and a new Russian Czardomof the proletariat.  Neither can she afford to make a peace which would be a meretruce for the gaining of time by her enemy.  On the other hand, demobilisation andfinancial economy are essential to her, and she cannot afford indefinitely to keep  anarmy on the Berezina, half-way to Moscow.     General Pilsudsky  told me that it was  his opinion as a  General  that he  couldinarch to Moscow next May, but he added as  a politician : &quot; What could I do when Igot there? &quot;  I replied that clearly he must not go there except in  alliance withRussians, and it was agreed that I should do  all that I could to bring his Governmentand  that of General Denikin into conference.  His chief objection lay in  the factthat he had tried to  come to terms with Denikin  and had failed, either  becauseDenikin referred him to distant Koltchak or refused to consider frontier problemsaltogether, saying they were  reserved for the future Russian  Constituent Assembly.My own opinion is  that both the Denikin representative at Warsaw and the Polishrepresentative with Denikin have been small and futile men, and have been playedwith by the propaganda.  Both Generals alike have been badly served.     I have pointed out to General Denikin that he could not expect Poland to throwher whole weight into the war unless the principle, at any rate, on which the frontierwould  be fixed were accepted beforehand.  If Poland took  any other course,  whatwould be her position as a small State when she had helped to set up afresh a mightyPower at Moscow ?  I told him quite plainly that the attitude which he had hithertoassumed would not result in business, and I  am ^lad to say that as the conversationprogressed he saw the point and told me he  would accept responsibility as Dictator,provided that after a little consideration he felt that what he was asked to do wasbest for the future of  Russia.  The happy outcome of that  consideration will befound expressed in  General Denikin&apos;s telegram to General Lukomsky four days aftermy interview  (Appendix B 2).                                        -The Present Prospect.   -  The Volunteer army has now  been  defeated, and I do not yet feel quite sure that the  Cossacks  will resist the  Bolshevik advance.  The  last word  I had withGeneral Denikin was through General Holman just before I left Russia.  Denikinregarded the position as temporarily stabilised, provided that the Cossack politiciansdid  not listen to the  propaganda which  was insinuating that the Bolsheviks wouldgive them special terms.   I am sure, however, that the, Cossacks may be trusted torise again at the first opportunity, even should they come to terms in the present crisis.  When I left,  the news from the front was encouraging, some 8,000 prisonershaving been taken  from the Bolsheviks in two encounters on the Don.   The ice onthe Don had broken up in the rapid thaw which had providentially set in.   general denikin had  reconstituted his Ministry, and had included representatives of  thethree Cossack peoples Don, Kuban, and Terek.  The signs were thus propitious in regard to the  Generals bid for Cossack support.  Six or eight weeks hence the RiverDon will be coming down  ten miles broad.     The present hope of the Denikinites is  to preserve as a base  for future  action a row of three relatively small territories,  which they are seeking to defend by  a war of position, namely:  (1) the peninsula east  of the Strait  of Yenikali, including the important port of Novorossisk, with a wide  and fertile glacis in the Cossack countryeast of the Sea of Azov;  (2) the peninsula of the  Crimea south of the Isthmus of Perrekop; and (3) the city and district of  Odessa.  Naturally, the question  arises whether the Government  of  such a relatively small group ol territories  is  worth supporting when we have discharged our  debt  of honour  by removing those who would  inevitably suffer the  vengeance of the conquerors. In this regard  I  would point out three considerations.     1.  First  Consideration.-^,  the  first  place  it  is certainly the intention of General Denikin in the last desperate resource to lead his Volunteer army, reduced to a few thousands of determined and courageous men, and to fight his way out in some direction.  He can only  take one  of two  directions : either he must go  into the Caucasus  region and  that would obviously be very undesirable or he must be able to pass across the Strait of Yenikali into the Crimea, I think we ought to guide  him in the second direction.     2.  Second Consideration. The other  two  are larger considerations.   If it  is
true that General Pilsudsky and the Poles must only go to Moscow in alliance withRussians, then it appears to me  of  the first importance to keep in being the onlyRussian Government in Europe outside the Bolshevik area.  I think, moreover, it isworth our while doing this.   Denikin&apos;s men have learned their lesson, though it hastaken a bitter schooling to teach it.   I believe that they are now in a mood to accept our guidance.  I think that there are great numbers in Bolshevik Russia who will gradually congregate  afresh around the Denikinite  flag, if that flag  be  carried forward with a new and sustained effort, and under new conditions leading to whollynew results.   The Denikinites now accept   the  principle  that organisation andmilitary advance must take place alternately, and that each step in the advance musthenceforth be limited by the rate of organisation.  They realise that the soil in whichBolshevism thrives is  that of economic paralysis.    3. Third Consideration. The third consideration arises out of the success ofmy negotiations.  We have now a Russian Government pledged to a resettlement ofRussia on the lines of policy  which we desire.  It would therefore obviously  be veryconvenient if that  were the Government which recovered Moscow.The Economic Difficulty.    The practical problem is how to set Denikin&apos;s  army free from the necessity ofliving on the country  through which it  advances.  I have considered this question with  General Denikin&apos;s Ministers.   It  is quite clear that, in view  of the  terriblelosses among the educated classes, the Russians have no sufficient organising powerleft to lift themselves out of  the slough.   They cannot even marshal a train on thesidings of a  station.  Moreover, we have to deal with small and obstructive peoplesuch  as the  Cossack  farmers, with poor  and therefore corrupt officials, and withspeculators taking advantage of propaganda. Yet if the country is to be reorganised,piece by  piece, and the military defence is  to be moved forward by  echelons, theremust be an army of a new type an army which can stand on  a line and no meremilitia, which,  as Denikin  says,  can  only  advance or  retreat.   Moreover,  theCossacks should be dispensed with except for the defence of their own territory, or as scattered recruits in a regular  army.    These  requirements imply some regular financial  system.  Finance  in turnpostulates commercial exchanges, even if only in the  nature of barter.   Thus we havean  inexorable chain (1.) army which can  stand without advancing and withoutlooting, (2) Finance, (3) Commerce.    At the present time a general  receives  his long settled pay of 2,000 roubles amonth, which in pre-war time was equivalent to  2,400 a year, but is now equivalentat the rate of 2,000 roubles  to the  pound sterling to only  120 a year.   You canto-day buy a  cooked goose at Ekaterinodar for the pre-war equivalent of  100 andan  uncooked  goose for about  40.   A subaltern&apos;s pay will not give him his ownbreakfast, let alone that of  his wife.   The present financial system consists of aprinting press, which for all  I know has been captured at Rostov.  The exchange ofgoods has been so paralysed  that the peasant will  willingly sell neither grain, for human food nor horses for the cavalry, and this Russian warfare is largely a matterof food and cavalry.A Constructive Plan.    The only plan that I can think of  is to form a temporary monopoly  for thecontrol of credit and imported goods.  The Denikin  Government  has tried to controlexports and has failed, as was inevitable under the  circumstances. If the resourcesof a whole group of  existing British  agencies  were syndicated,  a  very powerfulinstrument might be forged  which would operate just as the Merchant Adventurersused to operate by  imposing &apos;a  certain  discipline on  the British importers intoRussia. You  have the Board of Trade, which controls the credit of twenty-six millionpounds for the guaranteeing  of exports to Eastern Europe; the Wheat Commission,which can give credit on the export of wheat  from  Russia; the South  RussianBanking Agency; the Canadian Government, which I understand might  give credit to exporters of agricultural machinery; and such firms as Vickers, who are interestedin locomotives.  Individual traders  might be grouped by such British Chambers ofCommerce as that of Constantinople.  The British traders of South Russia itselfare, it will be noted^asking to be organised (Appendix D 3), and Denikin&apos;s ministers are willing to accept help (Appendix D 1).  The co-operative system is still partially      [2125]              &apos;                               &apos;            C
 operative and should be made use of for the detail of barter, but is not free from graft and would not act efficiently on the larger scale.     If such a  temporary  monopoly could be established,  and  if the  proposed syndicate were to agree to work  in harmony with the High Commissioner for South Russia, then the High Commissioner would have in his hands a very powerful weapon wherewith  to exact reasonable  practice in regard to export licences and similar matters.  Such an arrangement  would, in fact, go right past graft and speculators, and place manufactured goods at an honest price for barter against the rich supplies of food which the country produces for export.  It teems at. this moment with food; I have seen it with my own eyes, and it should be quite feasible to set going again such ports as Novorossisk and Odessa, to the advantage among others of the British tax- payer, who is at present burdened with the wheat subsidy.   Had such system been in operation last summer, I feel sure that the present disaster would not have occurred. There might have been defeat at the front, but there would not have been the sudden collapse of moral.     I have suggested  to General Denikin that in return for the necessary  rights the syndicate should tax itself, either on the imports and exports handled, or  on the total profits, and should thus collect revenue for  his  Government.  With graft and speculation eliminated the goods would be cheaper, even though  taxed.  This would enable Denikin to set a  real Government going.  At present there is an army and no real Government. He has no methods of obtaining order except military methods. I have talked this plan over with various people who know the  country and I find no dissent on the broad  idea. I  will not burden  this report with  the discussion of details. The first step forward.     The first Military movement forward should  be limited to an advance from the Odessa-Perikop direction to  a line  which would include the Donetz Basin.  The wheat country which feeds  Odessa  would be recovered,  and also the coal of the Donetz Basin.   If  supplied with manufactured  articles  the Kuban would in the meantime probably feed the whole area Novorossisk, Crimea  and  Odessa.     My belief is that,  owing to  the  nature of the produce in this country wheat, coal, sugar and hides a single  season would suffice  to set the economic life going again, and I am inclined to think that it would not require much more than such a limited military advance as  I have indicated, and such an economic organisation as I have sketched, to establish a  contrast on the two sides of the  defensive line,  a contrast as  it were between Heaven  and Hell, which  would result in the sudden collapse  of  the Bolshevik tyranny.   There  might also result, I would  point out incidentally, something in the nature of a Federal System, since  the part of Russia first reorganised would coincide with the Ukraine, in the large sense, and the Cossack territory. But such Federal projects should not be spoken of publicly in England. They wall be realised I think, but at present they merely tend to  divide Denikin&apos;s supporters. The  Caucasus and Near  East.     There remains to be considered the bearing of the Russian situation on affairs in the  Caucasus and the Near East.  Mr. Wardrop came to meet me on New Year&apos;s Day.  We went into the harbour  of Novorossisk at the same hour  in two men-of-war. He described to me with pride his Georgians. He described the system of arbitration treaties which he had secured between the three  republics of Georgia,  Azerbaijan, and  Armenia.  He told me that  at that very time a conference was sitting in Tiflis which  was studying the question of their federation.  I asked him whether, if a sea of* Bolshevism rolled forward and lapped against the northern foot of the Caucasus, he thought that  his federation, and at any rate the Georgians would remain true. He was very unwilling to think that they  would go under, but in the end he admitted that possibly there might be  such a menace as would prove irresistible.  No sooner had he returned home on the 3rd January, than he sent me a telegram showing that the danger  had  suddenly burst  upon him, and after that date I had a  series  of telegrams which indicated  that the Georgian Government  was  under threat  of disappearing in a revolution.  The Allied recognition of the  de  facto Governmentsof Georgia and Azerbaijan  has  for the time being again strengthened the orderly elements in those states, but I venture the opinion that we must not rely indefinitely
 on the, storm of patriotism described in Mr. Wardrop&apos;s last telegram.  The people of Baku have been Bolshevik before and undoubtedly may go Bolshevik again.     I am informed on realiable evidence that  General Denikin&apos;s flotilla is  likely in the first instance to remain proof, but that,  deprived of its base at Petrovsk, it might attack Baku.   This  was undoubtedly the  idea of  the younger officers last September, but  they  were restrained  by the  senior officers under  orders  from General Denikin.  I have already telegraphed to your Lordship  suggesting that as a temporary measure this flotilla should be offered, the hospitality  of Enzeli in North Persia,&apos;  and General  Denikin has I believe asked that  it  should be received in a friendly way at Baku.   These, however, could only be very temporary measures. When the Volga ice melts towards to end of March the Bolshevik flotilla will make its appearance in the Caspian Sea, and may base itself upon Baku and Krasnovodsk. The oil  trade may forthwith  be set going up the Volga,  and the resources of the Bolshevik  State be enormously increased.  On the other hand the Bolshevik flotilla consists  onlv of shallow-draught vessels and British leadership would probably give victory to  the&apos; Denikinite flotilla.  Or again  there  are not  wanting indications that in certain  eventualities, if left to itself, the Denikin flotilla might go Bolshevik, the crews overpowering the officers&apos;.    . It is only by strong immediate measures, taken before the thawing; of the Volga- ice, that the advance of Bolshevism, sweeping forward like  a  prairie  fire, can  be limited,  and kept away from  India and Lower Asia, pending  the advance  from Poland and Odessa, It must be remembered, moreover, that the very success of that Polish and South Russian advance, on a line  extending from  the Gulf olf Finland to the Sea of d&apos;azof!, would tend to drive the Bolsheviks into Asia,  and it  is essential, therefore,  to regard the  Caspian and  Caucasian barrier  as a  part of the larger policy.  But  I  cannot  look  upon a Caucasian barrier as  more  than  a temporary expedient  of a not very substantial character: the  only final  remedy is to kill Bolshevism at the source.     A very significant capture was recently  made in the  Crimea of two  Turkish officers who had crossed the Black Sea from Asia Minor.   The one was the  nephew of Mustapha Pasha, the  Nationalist  leader  in  Asia Minor,  and the other  was an A.D.C. to Enver Pasha.  They  had expected that by the  date of their landing the Bolsheviks would have been in possession of the Crimea.  Thus the correlation of the Nationalist movement among the Turks with  the Committee  of  Union and Progress is proved, and  also their understanding  with  the Bolsheviks.   In this connection, I must draw attention to the fact that Sevastopol in the hands of the Bolsheviks would, to say the least, be  very inconvenient to  us as  a sea power in the Black Sea.     A similar understanding  is, I think, indicated by the advance of Bolshevik cavalry from Astrachau southward simultaneously with Wardrop &apos;s warning from Georgian&quot; sources that  a  Bolshevik republic  was  to be proclaimed in  the North Caucasus in a fortnight&apos;s  time.   Unfortunately,  the  congestion on the railways prohibited my travelling in the  direction of  Daghestan, nor  did  I think it  wise to accept Mr. Wardrop&apos;s  invitation to Tiflis until I  could  go there with Denkinite representatives to negotiate  an alliance.  I hope nothing  untoward will occur  in relation to Daghestan in the meantime.  Now that  Georgia has been  recognised as a de facto  Government, negotiations are not very  practicable  unless the  Denikinite Government is also so recognised. Alone, I do not believe, from all I can gather, that the trans caucasian republics  would stand long against Bolshevism.   In alliance with Denikin and Poland they would be  essential links in the chain confining theenemy.   Tlierefore  the Daghestan problem must be regarded as subordinate to the problem  of arriving at friendly relations between Georgia  and Denikin.  I tried to impress that view on Mr. Wardrop1. Two Political Difficulties.     I see two difficulties in the way of my proposals.  The one is the possible jealousy of France,  and the other is the hostility of certain classes of our own electorate.  In regard to France, it is  quite clear we must carry her with us.  The awkward fact,however, remains, and  has been quite frankly stated to me both by General Denikin and General Vrangel,  that for reasons which are. well known to your Lordship theFrench are for the time being hated in South Russia,   I feel, therefore, that it wouldbe wise  if  the French would.allow us to take the lead in the economic organisatonwhich I have outlined.  I agree that they should subsequently be.brought into any temporary  monopoly.      [2125]                                                         C 2
    In regard to the other difficulty, the hostility of our own working classes, I feelthat the time has  come when the truth should be carried home to them.  They mustbe made to1 realise that, whatever the communistic ideals originally characteristic of bolshevism, there  is to-day a growing threat from Moscow of a state of affairs whichwill render this world a very unsafe place for democracies.    Incidentally it ma,y here be remarked as  a  useful point when combating the propaganda,  that the Cossacks,, who are just now Denikin&apos;s mainstay against theBolsheviks, are a  very democratic &quot;people.  As an example, they have just put an embargo on the safes of the profiteers in the banks at Ekaterinodar in order to stop the export of the diamonds on which the said profiteers had hoped to live in peace inother  lands.   The Cossacks are now contemplating a  Duma, and have just freelyelected their own Atamans.Alternative Dangers in the Offing.    1. A Jacobin Czardom. Two possibilities, other than that of German penetration-tion and veiled control, present themselves to my  mind  as the result of my contact with South Russia affairs.  On the one hand  is the growth of a Jacobin Czardom,which at some opportune juncture, when; the Allies were suffering from misunder-standing, would be accepted as the overt ally of Germany and Turkey.  The newarmy, the persistent propaganda, and the beginnings  of a centralised industry allpoint  in this direction.   I need not more than refer  to the danger of  Bolshevismunder such circumstances in India  and China.    2. A Well-fed Barbarism. The other possibility is that which might well ensueif the advice of those were taken  who would leave Bolshevism to stew in its ownjuice.  Let us assume that Trotsky and his  terror dissolved in that juice.   Whatwould be the result ?   Nothing impresses itself more clearly on my mind than that,without an organised effort based on foreign brain and capital, Russia is now quiteincapable of re-establishing herself  unless after a  generation and by a new birth.  Ibelieve that left to herself she would for a long time relapse into a condition of well-fed barbarism.  The present state  of economic paralysis could continue indefinitelyonly in a country most parts of which overflow with food.    The war-cry  of  Makhno,  the  bandit leader in the Southern Ukraine, is veryinstructive.  The Makhno  rising: in rear off  the  Denikin  army last summer andautumn was no political movement against Denikin and in favour  of Bolshevism.Its slogan was as follows:  &quot; Down  with all authority; kill the lords for they own theland;  kill the Jews for they own the money; kill the Generals (i.e., the Denikinites);kill the Communists (i.e., the Bolsheviks), and  then the country will deal with the towns, and will  say  what  the towns  must  give in  return for food (i.e.,  whatmanufactured articles).&apos;&apos;    Had Denikin got to Moscow last autumn, and had order  then  broken downgenerally,&apos; as I think most likely, or had Bolshevism, unopposed, been  left to decay of itself, as some people advocated in either case, I believe  that  a vast amorphouspopulation would have been the outcome.  The elements of the situation would havebeen an immense monotonous plain, inhabited comparatively thickly by an illiteratepeasantry,  a few  decayed towns, speculators, mostly hated Jews, supplying  suchmanufactured articles as could be absorbed at extortionate prices; no educated&apos;class,or none capable of diffusing more than  a glimmer of light; an impoverished andsuperstitious Church, and bands of marauders roaming the country.  Out of such awelter history might produce again, as so often before  from these very plains, somegreat leader of nomads who would gather the bands together and fall now on thisborder region and now on that.  Asia and Europe  alike  would have  to maintainmilitary borders.  Already a generation of unschooled, and in some cases deliberatelydepraved children is growing up m the Russian towns. The common talk in south russia is oif a period of ten or twenty years of anarchy:  there have been two or threesuch periods in the national history.    It is true that no man can say for certain what would be the course of eventsif you allowed Bolshevism to enjoy its present triumph, but explore the future as you will on that  assumption and 1 can see no  peace for the world.    Whether thefuture of Russia be  anarchy, or tyranny, or servitude  to the German, matters not;none  of these conditions can co-exist with democracy in the world of to-day.  Lastspring, and perhaps even last summer, had the question  been studied on the spot,and had action been taken not merely to supply munitions to General Denikin, butto give him sufficient advice and economic help, these  dangers  might perhaps have
 been  exorcised at a comparatively cheap rate.   This year I believe that they can still be effectively dealt with, though at a somewhat greater cost.  Next year it may well be too late for any but heroic measures.    Immediate Steps Proposed. But  immediate steps must be taken if a construc- tive and truly remedial policy is contemplated.   A  firm declaration by Britain especially that she will  not make peace with Bolshevism should be issued; it is she and not France which is suspect; it is  her support and not that of France which is valued; it  is Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s definite promise and not that of M. Clemenceau which js desired, and ardently desired.  Timely assistance should be given in naval and technical ways  for the holding of the  Isthmus of Perikop and the defended areas of Odessa and Novorossisk.  Help in  the way of loan should be promised to the Poles, provided they ally themselves with Denikin on proper terms  in regard to their  eastern frontier.   The Denikin Government should be recognised de facto, provided that its basis be broadened.   The organisation of the syndicate  for giving credit and  for the control of imports into South Russia should be set on foot.  The position in the  Caspian Sea should be assured.  The Baltic provinces, Georgia  and Azerbaijan, should be brought into the  Polish-Denikinite League of Governments.    The initial steps of such a policy would, I am persuaded, send a thrill through all the east of Europe, which in a month would wholly alter the moral of the people in that part of the world. Mere vague promises will not have much effect now. There have been too many of them, and the people of  Russia are too weary to be stimu- lated  by anything but the opening moves of  a coherent and energetic policy, which should then be  carried through without hesitation.                     I have the honour to be,                          with the highest respect,                                  My Lord,                     Your Lordship&apos;s most obedient,                                        humble  Servant,                                          H.  J. MACKINDER,                               British High  Commissioner for South  Russia.    Note. I have not referred to the  agrarian question in this report because mytime for enquiry has as yet been short.   The matter of alliances and barter seemedmuch more urgent.  But the agrarian  question was touched upon in my conversa-tions  with  General Denikin and his Ministers,  and  it was assumed  that a  boldAgrarian reform must be a part of any &quot;modern &quot; policy.

APPENDIX A.               From Sir H. Rumbold to Foreign Office, London.                    Telegram No. 487 of December 16,  1919.    MR. MACKINDER arrived here on the 1,3th instant, and we have thoroughly-discussed the Russian question as seen from here.    I find that the advice which I have consistently tendered to the Polish Govern-ment, namely, to get on good terms with General Denikin, is in accordance withMi\ Mackinder&apos;s instructions.   I specially explained to Mr. Mackinder  that thePolish Government were perplexed  at the attitude  of  His Majesty&apos;s government towards Bolshevism, and emphasised our  unpopularity in connection  with  thedecision relating to Eastern Galicia.    Mr. Mackinder, General Keyes, and myself were received together by GeneralPilsudsky yesterday.  The interview lasted nearly two hours.   General Pilsudsky&apos;sdemeanour was stiff at  the beginning of the interview,  but it became much morecordial after hearing Mr. Mackinder&apos;s  explanations  regarding  the desire of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government for a strong Poland in friendly relations with Russia,  andin view of the light cast on the Eastern Galician decision.    We asked General Pilsudsky whether, in his opinion, Bolshevism was merely afacade behind which a moderate party was developing.   He replied  emphaticallythat whilst  a short time ago the moderate element seemed to be progressing, theextreme elements were now in command.  He said that whilst the Bolsheviks wouldprobably be  prepared to make peace, they would never stick to any agreement they made, and he certainly would not enter into negotiations with them.    At the  beginning of the interview he expressed himself pessimistically aboutGeneral Denikin&apos;s organisation, but admitted that the Polish troops had only comeinto contact with loosely organised  bands of Denikin&apos;s troops who were operating in the Ukraine.   He spoke in the same manner about General Denikin to  us as he did to General Mannerheim, as reported in my telegram  No. 482  of 13th December.He expressed the opinion that at the present moment the  Bolshevik  military organisation was superior to that of General Denikin.  He asserted  that general denikin would never alone be able to overthrow the Bolshevik regime.    None the  less he regarded the Bolsheviks at the present time as living in nonetoo good case, and was decidedly of opinion that the Polish army alone could go to moscow next spring, but from a political point of view he asked himself  what heshould do when and if  he got there.  We then said that this pointed a co-opera-tion with Denikin, and he agreed.   We pointed out that  the Polish war againstthe Bolsheviks was a great financial drain on his country;  as he had himself said thathe did not mean to negotiate with the Bolsheviks, did not that point  to  definitesteps to come to an agreement with Denikin ?   He replied that,  although he had arepresentative at Denikin&apos;s headquarters, all attempts to talk with the latter hadbeen met with elusive reference to Admiral Koltchak.  At this point Mr. Mackind^rsuggested  that General Pilsudsky might perhaps send to Denikin&apos;s headquarters amore  influential  Polish  representative with whom  Mr. Mackinder could keep intouch.  General Pilsudsky saw the point, and said that he would seriously considerthe matter.    We then enquired whether,  supposing Mr. Mackinder  could persuade Denikinof the desirability of effective negotiations with the Poles,  a  meeting  might not beheld between the two parties.  General Pilsudsky, in reply, proposed  that Denikinshould come to Warsaw, but we pointed out that the latter could  hardly be expectedto come here,  and that some halfway house such as Czernowitz might  be more suit-able.  General Pilsudsky seemed favourable to this idea, as he thought that  seriousnegotiations could be better conducted in a more quiet atmosphere.    At this stage of the discussion it seemed desirable that we  should explain thereasons for  the apparent hesitation of British  opinion in regard both to the Polesand to General Denikin.  We therefore said  as regards the former that british public opinion had some suspicion as to the use to which the  Poles might put theirvictory over the Bolsheviks.   General Pilsudsky emphatically disclaimed imperial-istic desires and made the important declaration that he was willing to allow the
future position of the inhabitants of the country as far back as the Conference linethrough Brest Litovsk to be submitted to a plebiscite.  We expressed satisfactionat this declaration,  having regard to the effect it would produce on British publicopinion and probably on Denikin.  As regards the latter, Mr.  Maekinder admitted that it was probable that there were reactionary elements round Denikim  but thathe was instructed to express to Denikin the hope of the British Government that hewould follow a modern policy.  This settlement was welcomed by General Pilsudsky,who made no concealment of  the fact that Polish  public opinion coincided in thismatter with the British, and he added  that  he was convinced of the danger ofreactionary tendencies in South Russia.    To sum up, we  brought General  Pilsuldsky to the point of  expressing his graf -tude to us for the prospect of  negotiations with Denikin with a view to co-operationnext spring, but we are of the  opinion .that some difficulty may be found in the subordinate position of General Denikin with  reference to Admiral Koltchak.  Wewould therefore like to suggest, for the consideration  of His  Majesty&apos;s Government,whether British influence might not  be brought to  bear on Admiral Koltchak witha view to some public modification of General Denikin&apos;s position on the initiative of Admiral Koltchak.    General Pilsudsky called our attention to  what he regarded as the unfortunateimpression produced,  especially on the Baltic States,  by the  present negotiations atCopenhagen.                    From Sir H. Rumbold to Foreign Office.                    Telegram No. 488 of December 16, 1919.    MY immediately preceding  telegram.    Mr. Mackinder and I had a long talk with M. Paderewsky after our interview with General Pilsudsky.  Although M. Paderewsky is no longer in office, he can speak with  authority both  in the facts of the situation  and on the views of the PolishGovernment.  He endorsed what General Pilsudsky had said as regards the presentcomplexion  and  power  of the  Bolshevik  Government  and  confirmed  GeneralPilsudsky&apos;s declaration regarding the readiness of the Poles to allow plebiscites backto the Brest-Litovsk line.    M. Paderewsky agreed as to the desirability of Polish negotiations with a viewto effective co-operation next spring with General Denikin.  He referred, however,to the Eastern Galician and  Lithuanian questions, and expressed the hope that definite decisions in regard to them might  be deferred lest  Polish public opinion should be discouraged.    As regards Eastern Galicia, he said  that  the proposed statute  for EasternGalicia was  a bar  to the exercise  of an   effective mandate comparable  with the mandates entrusted to other States.  Theie would be an initial Ruthenian majority in the proposed Eastern Galician  Diet  which would from the outset render thePolish mandate-nugatory.   The position of the Polish Government as mandatorywould thus be a difficult one.  In support of his desire that a definite decision in thismatter might be postponed he pointed out that within the last few weeks the position had changed owing to the elimination of Petlura from the Ukraine.    As regards Lithuania, Mr. Mackinder said that, according to his instructions,the British  Government attached importance to the national aspirations alreadyrecognised in a de facto sense  of the three Baltic  provinces, but that their  indepen-dence was  regarded  as subject to limitation  in  respect of  superior  interests.M. Paderewsky said that, in regard to Esthonia and Latvia, the superior interests were  clearly  Russian, and  in  the case of  Lithuania  he  thought that they  werePolish.  He said that the Poles were willing  to give complete autonomy to Lithuaniawith a local Diet, but wished to retain a common defence, customs, and currency.In fact, the proposed combination  would   be  comparable to the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, and  he regarded it as essential to Poland both for the purposeof keeping  Germany and Russia apart and of giving Poland access to  the ports ofMemel and Libau.
&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;      /APPENDIX B.     1.  Memorandum by Mr. Mackinder of interview between General Denikin ,               and himself at Tikhoretskaya on January 10,  1920.                                 Present:              General Denikin.             General Romanovsky.             M. Neratof.                 Also,  towards&apos;  the   end  two  other Russian  Generals  and                 Baron Nolken.             Mr. Mackinder.             General Keyes.                 Also,  towards the end, General Holman.             Colonel  Svigentsof,  (Interpreter excellent).     AFTER an exchange of compliments I asked if, in view of the critical events in progress, and of the value of the Generals time, I might venture to speak boldlyand directly.  General Denikin assented willingly.  I said that the campaign of thepast year appeared at one time to be on the point of success.  His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had  supported  General  Denikin  with  munitions.  Now, however, that the campaign had failed I  was bound to tell him His  Majesty&apos;s Government did notbelieve that Bolshevism  could be conquered by arms alone.  The recent advance onMoscow had been a great adventure.  The ground gained was not properly organised and administered  in rear.  The  result was  that the  Makhno and  Green  bandsmarauded  in the South.  Had General Denikin reached Moscow it  was a greatquestion ,whether order would  not  have broken down  all over Russia  before theeconomic life of the country could have been restored.     If the  position were now to be saved, it being assumed that the Kuban and the crimea could be held, the only course was to undertake  the war against Bolshevismby stages, advancing and organising alternately.   The Russian masses want Peace;the peasants wish to enjoy their land and their homes.   No army which lives  on thecountry can be anything but unpopular.  Therefore the  army of the future mUst be properly paid and provided for.  This  implied  an  organised system of taxes andfinances, and for this you must restore trade.  In other words a state, and not merelyan army, must be set going.  The riches of South Russia are such that this could bedone in a few  months with Western help.    But the West will not help unless assured of the aims as well as the businesslikemethods  of the  contemplated  State.   When Mr. Lloyd George recently  quotedLord Beaconsfield as  against a United Russia he was thinking of two alternativeRussians which he saw before him.  On the  one hand a conquering despotism calledBolshevism; on the other hand a restored  centralised  Russia, the Government ofwhich had  learned nothing from the events of the last few years.  Such  a restoredand unregenerate Russia, quite possible of realisation in the present exhausted stateof the people,  would  only imply further revolutions  or foreign adventures to avoidthem.     I said  that  everyone trusted General Denikin himself,  but that the  peoples of west would not believe  in the intentions of his  Government,  unless they saw thatreforms were  put in  progress  as he  advanced.   He must set  up, I would not saynecessarily  a fully democratic government in the western sense, but a modern govern-ment.  But General  Denikin alone could not now defeat the Bolsheviks; he musthave Allies.  The British would not put an Army into Russia, however great their desire to suppress Bolshevism.  For one reason the pride of the Russians  themselvesforbade it.   Therefore the Finns, the Esthonians,  the Letts, the Poles, the  Georgians,                    From Sir H. Rumbold to Foreign Office.                  &apos;  Telegram No. 491 of December 17, 1919.    MY telegram No. 487 of the 16th December.    At our interview with the Chief of the State  the  latter referred to the criticalposition of the Esthonians  and said that they were too  far off for effective help.General Pilsudsky shared the view that the Bolsheviks meant to try to deal with theirenemies one by one,  and said that he had  certain information showing that theymeant to tackle Poland last of all.
and  perhaps the Roumanians were the. allies to be sought, with  the  British andFrench giving support by economic methods and organising brain.  The Poles were essential.  They were themselves in danger.  Their terms would not be hard I spokewith  knowledge.  But  General Denikin must be  prepared  to take  politicalresponsibility.  Would he accept the proposal of calling in the Great Powers, or twoor three of the most disinterested of them, to settle frontier questions.  It was useless to think that Poland would co-operate effectively, unless she were assured beforehandof the equitable settlement of her Eastern frontier.  There must be no such calamityas a war between Russia and Poland, after they had marched into Moscow together as allies.     General Denikin then replied to my various points.   He said that he did  notthink a soldier would describe his recent advance as an adventure   I interposedthat it was  General Pilsudsky who first used that expression to me.  He said thatthe conditions of life in Bolshevik Russia were very bad.  I said that it  was truethat the peasants had welcomed his army with flowers,  but that  gradually  theexactions  levied by his  officers, and the robberies  of the Cossacks, had changedthat feeling, and that now I believed the peasants hated both the contending armiesimpartially.  General Denikin said that he was afraid  it  was  too -true, but that circumstances had been against him.  The present armies were merely  militias andmust advance or retreat; they could not stand still.  He then turned to  the questionof the autonomy of the border peoples.  He said that his principle was to restore theAU-iRussia,  great and  indivisible.   He  said  that  at present  central  power wasindispensable, and military dictatorship,  and that  no collegium was possible,  butthat plans were being elaborated and would be submitted to the future ConstituentAssembly of the Russian people.  I asked if it were his intention that that assembly should include  representatives of the border peoples.  He replied in the affirmative.I then pointed out that, if that were so, the border peoples would each of them forma very small minority in the presence of the great majority of Russians  proper; thatthe border peoples at present  have de facto independence and the support of  theAllies, and that he could hardly expect them to accept  conditions which  implied thatan all powerful majority was of its mere goodness and free will to  grant them somecrumbs of autonomy.   He saw the point, but said that he had thought of his princeple as a trust, and had hoped to defer political questions until Bolshevism was defeated.On what authority was he to take political responsibility ?  It was true that AdmiralKoltchak had  given him  liberty  of  action,  but  his  Government and  that  of admiral Koltchak were not recognised by the  Powers. I said that I quite saw hisobjections, and from the point of view of juridical theory they were  good, but atpresent the question  was of saving Russia, and he had  already told me  he was adictator.  Poland could not be expected to attach weight to his scruples; GeneralPilsudsky complained that he could  not negotiate because General  Denikin waselusive.   Before a Constituent Assembly was elected someone would have  to takethe responsibility of  deciding the limits off the area within which the elections wereto be held.     At this point it  became evident that General Denikin had  made  up his mind for a change of attitude.  He told me that under the circumstances he would accept responsibility if, after a little thought, he came to the conclusion that  what he was asked to do was for  the good of Russia.     The discussion then turned  to financial matters, I pointed out  that he must not expect further financial help from the British Treasury, and that he must utilisethe very great resources of South Russia itself, and  I sketched to him the schemewhich will be found set forth in Appendix D to this report.  I told him that if some such schemes were adopted  I thought that the proposed temporary syndicate mighttax the imports a,nd  exports which it handled, and  so give him a real  revenue as a substitute for  his present printing press. He made minor objections, but at theend of five hours of very pleasant, if serious,  discussion he thanked me, saying thathe would consult with his Ministers and communicate with me further without delay.                                                                    H. J. M.&quot;     Note. The same evening he sent Baron Nolken  to me with a message to say thathe had just appointed  the Ataman of the Don  Cossacks as his  new first Minister,but  that he begged me to continue my negotiations with his existing  Ministers asexperts, reminding me at the same time  that the power was his.  He added thatM. Krivoshein was one of the existing Ministers I  should meet, and that althoughthe new Ministry  had not been completed he thought that M. Krivoshein would bein it.-H. J. M.[2125]D
2. Telegram from Lieutenant-General Denikin to Lieutenant-General  Lukomsky,                             January 1/14, 1920.(Translated by General Keyes and Colonel Svigentsol&apos;.  Original at Novorossisk.)     I INSTRUCT you to communicate the following verbatim to Mackinder :-     1. I recognise the de facto independence of the border governments who  are carrying on the struggle against the Bolsheviks.     2. The settlement of  the future relations of  the border with Russia must be accomplished by means of an agreement between the All-Russian Government andthe border governments.     3. The mediation of the Allies can be accepted in this matter.     4. The question of the Eastern frontier of Poland will be settled, by an agree-ment between the  All-Russian Government and the Polish Government on ethno-graphical principles.     5. Poland should afford assistance by armed forces in an  immediate partialoffensive in order to divert part of the Bolshevik forces and by the further develop-ment of operations at as early a date as possible and in full measure.     6. The Allies should- &apos;     (a.)  Decisively and immediately  take  steps to protect the Black Sea Govern-           ment, Crimea, and Odessa by means of naval power.     (b.)  Assist Bulgaria and Serbia to send troops.     (c.) Ensure the transport of troops mentioned in (b) by their tonnage.     (d.)  Continue  the  supply of  military munitions to armed  forces of  South           Russia.                                                           .

In regard to 6 (d) I have pointed out that direct assistance cannot begiven after the 31st  March, but that very great assistance can be given indirectlyby the organisation of the resources of Russia herself. H. J. M.     Note 2. The form of this telegram is that of an  army order or staff minute.It is so that General Denikin gives all his  political decisions.  An order in similarmilitary  form was taken by a British General to Poland  and  shown  to GeneralPilsudsl^y.   It gave great offence where none was intended.  I think it is time thatGenerals were prohibited  from roaming about Europe on unauthorised politicalmissions. EE. JVM.APPENDIX C.Memorandum of Interview at  Warsaw between Mr. Mackinder, M.P.,  and Baron    Ropp, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Petrograd, on December 17, 1919.    ARCHBISHOP ROPP stated that he had been arrested by the Bolsheviks asa hostage on the  capture of Vilno by the Poles, that he had been confined in fivedifferent prisons, warned that he would be shot by way of reprisal if necessary, thenkept under open arrest in the house of a priest  in Moscow,  and finally released andenabled less than a month ago to leave Moscow and cross the lines into Poland.   a tour Legation it was learnt that his  release had been effected by exchange in the
  regular way.   The Archbishop announced his intention of proceeding to the Vatican  and then returning to his diocese in Soviet Russia.      Asked to give his impressions of Soviet Russia, Baron Ropp replied that it wa-  possible to describe the Government or institutions of England or France, but not of  Soviet Russia, where it was possible only to quote instances of the sort of things  that were  happening.      The country was in the hands of five or six  men,  so-called  Idealists,  chiefly  Jews, and of a band of brigands.  He considered that if Trotsky,  Radek, Zinovief,  Derzjinsky, and Lenin  (who was losing  importance)  were removed, Bolshevism  would collapse.  He was of opinion that  the  Intelligenzia  in Soviet  Russia were  far too much crushed to make any effort to rise against the Bolsheviks, but he was  sure that they would all welcome above everything else  the arrival of Denikin at  Moscow and Petrograd,  pushed by the Allies.   The peasants, too, would welcome  him if he came as a reasonable man.     Until  a couple of months ago the people looked confidently towards the Allies,  but recently the continuous tergiversation of the Allied policy was causing them to  lose faith in the Allies and to place their hopes in the Germans.   He thought that  there were not many Germans  at  present in Bolshevik Russia, but that there was  nevertheless constant liaison between Petrograd and Germany.   This was  greatly  facilitated by the lack of any effectual national boundary  between Soviet  Russia  and anti-Bolshevik countries.     Asked whether he subscribed to the view that the hands of the Bolsheviks were  strengthened by the active opposition of the anti-Bolshevik Russians  and of the  Allies, the  Archbishop replied that he knew there were people in Soviet  Russia who  held this view,  but that he himself could not express an opinion on the matter.     As an  example of the Jewish hold over the  country, he mentioned that a friend of his had heard the Commissaries at Smolensk  say that they only allowed non-Jews to hold power in such conspicuous places as Petrograd and  Moscow, but that the  Commissaries in the  provinces were all Jews.     The theory of the Bolshevik system was to collect food to central  institutions aud thence to distribute it direct to the. people; without the intermediary of middle- men.  For  purposes of distribution the people were divided into four categories, the first two. being manual and intellectual workers. The last two received, to use the Archbishop&apos;s phrase,  &quot; only matches.&quot;     In practice, however, the system was corrupt from top to bottom.  Had Russians been angels it might have worked, but Russians being what they  are, it was quite impracticable.   Thus an official&apos;commission  sent to get food from South-East Russia had to bribe people all along the line before  they could transport into the interior.     The economic condition of the country was becoming worse  and worse.  All fences round Moscow were being pulled down, and many  houses were being broken up for fuel.  Trains were becoming rarer and rarer.     The Bolshevik army  was held together mainly by terror, and  owed its success over its opponents principally to sheer weight of numbers. As an instance of their lack of zest for their cause, he  quoted the  capture of Orel by Denikin&apos;s troops  as seen by a friend of his.  The Bolshevik troops to the number of about 100 erected a barricade in the main  street,  a commissary harangued  them, a  single mounted Cossack appeared at the  other end of the street, the commissary  disappeared, the Bolsheviks fired and killed the horse of the  Cossack  who escaped into a  side  street. Four more of Denikin&apos;s men then appeared and put up their rifles, whereupon the Bolsheviks raised a white handkerchief.   Their.leader came out to  parley, and was asked by Denikin&apos;s men to cross himself.  This he did, and similarly all his men. The Denikinites  and the  100 ex-Bolsheviks  then went through the town re-estab- lishing the local authorities and turning out all Jews.    The  stories of Bolshevik  treatment  of women and  children were exaggerated. Women were not nationalised, but all difficulties had been removed in  the way of obtaining divorce.    Parents voluntarily sent their children to Bolshevik  schoolsbecause they were well fed there. But they were also badly spoilt aud taught nothing.    With regard to the land question, the Archbishop was  clear that the proprietorsmust not be allowed to return on the heels of Denikin and that the peasants mustbuy the land from the State.   He considered that big  properties should not be abolished but diminished.    He admitted that the peasants of  Great Russia might  be disposed  towardscommunism, but imthis connection he emphasised the distinction that must be drawn between such Slavonic races as the Poles, White  Russians,  and Little Russians, andthe Great Russians who are Finns and Tartars in origin.

2.0    As to the question&apos;of labour, Baron Ropp stated that managers were now paidabout twice as much as their workmen, and that all works were divided into fourgrades, of which the first two were those that were in good order and well situated.He mentioned with ridicule that a  Bolshevik professor had  instanced to  him&quot; asconclusive proof of the pride that workmen were now beginning  to take in their work the fact that certain workmen of the second category made trouble until theywere raised into the first category! &apos;Only the first category received a full supply of fuel.    Archbishop Ropp produced the impression of having a fair and well-balancedjudgment and of having an intimate and personal experience of conditions in  his country.                              APPENDIX D.1.                                 --To Mr. Mackinder,    THE Government of the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Porces in south russia,  Lieutenant-General Denikin, recognises  the  extreme  desirability of theBritish  Government considering  the  question of economic co-operation in south russia in order that, as the army advances, railway and water transport may be putin order in the shortest possible time, and also the economic life of the  country be restored and a sound system of barter be established with Allied countries.

CHELICHCHEF.    January 15, 1920.  Translation by General Keyes and Colonel Svegentsoif.- Original at Novorossisk.2. Memorandum by Mr. A. G. H. Dickson, Manager of the British Trade Corpora-    tion and Chairman of the London Committee of the National Bank of Turkey.             Trade and the South Russia Banking Agency, Limited.    IN what he described as a fundamental discussion, held in Constantinople onthe 28th December, 1919, Mr. H. J. Mackinder, iHigh Commissioner to South Russia,explained that British traders doing business  with that country must not look for fresh credits or guarantees from the Treasury  beyond the Export Credit Scheme ofthe Board of Trade and the purchases which the Wheat Controller might perhapsmake.    It is essential, he said, for the flow of trade to commence, and it is up to theCity of London to devise and organise a scheme of barter, it being for the momentimpracticable to attempt a reorganisation of  the rouble  currency.  In doing this,we shall  only  repeat  what we  have, often  successfully  done  in the  past bychartered  companies  and by bodies  of &quot; merchant adventurers,&quot;  who  have collec-tively opened up trade with undeveloped regions.  Practically speaking, Russia isto-day an  unorganised country with no civil Government.   It  is  for  England toprovide and run the  machinery required for the exchange  of commodities, and inhis opinion the prize  is well worth the effort.    mr. Mackinder  explained that he proposed to  spend the coming weeks in examining the&apos; position on  the spot, and  that anything  he now said  was subject
to modification resulting from this enquiry.   But he had given careful thought tothe matter, and had so far come to the conclusion that the surest way to success wouldbe through control of the bulk of imported goods by some body or institution run byEnglishmen,  and which would operate under his direct inspiration;  its agents up-country, who might euphemistically be called &quot; commercial travellers,&quot; would set upthe organisation required.     By  such  an arrangement Mr.  Mackinder would be armed with a  powerfulfulcrum wherewith to exercise pressure on the Russian authorities, who would thus be forced to  authorise exports on  an equitable footing; the unscrupulous importerwould be held in check, and undue competition against each other on the part of individual British firms would be reduced or eliminated.     Assuming, as is probable, that the Denikin front is again stabilised, a freshoffensive on his part is to be anticipated  in the spring, and by that time arrange-ments should have been completed to allow of the suggested organisation commencingoperations at  the right  moment.     Can the South  Russia Banking Agency,  Limited, either as at present consti-tuted or suitably enlarged, undertake the work suggested by Mr. Mackinder ?     The following points merit consideration :        (i.)  It  is  the  only suitable  British organisation on  the  spot,  and, being of            undoubted standing, would presumably inspire  confidence.      (ii.)  It has from its inception intended to specialise  in handling goods con-            signed  to it and  to run warehouses for their  storage  and  exchange            against  produce.     (iii.) Through its founders it will be in a strong position for offering financial            facilities against shipments in both directions.     (iv.) Arrangements should be  made whereby British goods consigned to it -            would be eligible for  advances under the export  credit  scheme, even            though unsold, on condition that it undertook not to part with the goods            except  against  produce of approximately  corresponding value; such            produce to  be held  at the disposal of the Export  Credit Department.            It is suggested that this  or some similar arrangement would be of  a            nature to confer a virtual monopolyto the institution selected as regards            direct shipments from England.      (v.) In the case of large consignments,  the probability is  that shippers would            send out special representatives to attend to their sale, but where neces-            sary the agency would undertake to sell on behalf of customers at limits            fixed by them.   Should it  be found feasible to control prices in Russia,         .   and thus be thought desirable to limit the profit of exporters to a maxi-            mum percentage of cost, as  the Export  Credit Department is already            checking cost prices, it could easily extend its system to  fixing sterling            sale prices for Russia.     (vi.) It would,  however, be necessary to  control the price of all imports and            not  only those shipped direct from  England.    This could  probably            best be done by an Anglo-Russian Commission sitting in South Russian            ports on the lines organised in Greece during the war.  This Commis-         -  sion would employ  the  South Russia Banking Agency,  Ltd., for the            handling of all the imports  authorised by it.    In  this manner the            fulcrum desired by the High  Commissioner would  be greatly strength-            ened  in the common interest.     (vii.) The agency would  provide  expert  valuers of the principal articles  of           export,  such as cereals, wool, tobacco, oil, hides,  &amp;c,  to  assist pur-            chasers of such commodities both at the ports and the leading centres           up-country.                                      &quot;   (Signed)       A.

3.  Memorandum from a Deputation of British Traders who waited on the High                      Commissioner on January 14, 1920.To H. J. Mackinder, Esq., M.P.,    His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Higli Commissioner in South Eussia.Sir,    THE following is the considered opinion of the Committee elected by the Britishtrading community  in South Russia as to the general principles upon which trade relations between Russia and Great Britain should be based.    The vicissitudes of civil war and the constant changes in the economic policyof the Russian Government made it impossible to carry  on trade on ordinary lines,solely on the responsibility of individual traders.   The ultimate  possibilities oftrade here are enormous, and in order to retain all opportunities for British enter-prise it is strongly urged that trade operations between the two countries should become-ordinated as far as matters of principle  are  concerned, through  a  central organisation, preferably under Government auspices, and that this organisation should  continue to function until normal conditions  are re-established.   It is desirable that representatives of His. Majesty&apos;s Government should approach the Government of the Armed Forces of South Russia in order to draft the principlesof a trading policy between the two countries.  This policy should be worked outin detail in order that the responsibilities  and difficulties to be faced by Britishtrading organisations should be precisely defined and made clear to all concerned.In this connection the utter depreciation of  currency is  a matter  to be seriously considered.    The organisation of transport and of the chief shipping ports represents a first essential, and, so far as is possible, should be effected through a joint organisationof Russian and British representatives.    Data, in amplification of the above proposals have been brought together,  and can be submitted  for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government as a basis forthe future conduct of economic affairs with South Russia.                                      (Signed)      R.  C.  PEARCE.                                                    C.  GRABOWSKY.                                                    ARTHUR DEACON.

Guarantee given by Mr. Mackinder to General Denikin at T ichor etskaya                         on the \$th January, 1920.    THE British High Commissioner for  South Russia on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment guarantees that all available ships, naval and commercial, will be usedto evacuate the wives and families, of Russian Officers if and when the necessityarises, and  that the British  Military Mission will form  the  rearguard for  theprotection of these wives and families, but both the High Commissioner and GeneralHolman are convinced that the necessity will not  arise if all Russian Officers will rise to the great occasion which  confronts  them.APPENDIX E.        Note on  German  Official Relations with the Soviet Government.    WHEN I was on the point of leaving Novorossisk on my journey home GeneralLukomsky made the following statements to me :       (    1. Krasin makes frequent journeys  to. Berlin.    2. Madame Kharitonenko,  wife  of  the  proprietor of  a sugar factory, wentfrom Malta to Geneva some one or two months ago.  At Geneva she met by accidentin a drawing-room bulow  and Allersleben. They told her they had received pleni-plenipotentiary powers to  go to  Moscow,  and to get into relations  with the SovietGovernment.    One  or other of them  showed her  their  passports.    MadameKharitonenko was in Novorossisk when I left, but I had not time to send for her andto cross-examine her.   I see no reason, however, to doubt the accuracy of  GeneralLukomsky&apos;s report of what she  had told him, though it seems curious that such ameeting should  have taken place by accident.o
