D. Lloyd George, O.M., M.P.             10, Downing Street,                      London, S.W.1.Sir,                        COAL.: INDUSTRY.     As instructed by the President of the Board of  Trade, wehave made an examination in accordance with the following termsof reference    (1)  &quot;To examine and report  upon the White Paper  of July 1919,            with a view to ascertaining whether the  estimates            contained in it were based upon assumptions or deduc-            tions which were reasonably and fairly reflected in            the information then obtainable.&apos;1and we haye now to. report as follows    fa) On the 3rd June 1919 Sir Evan D. Jones, Bart., M.P., the            lato Controller of  Coal Mines, presented to the Coal            Industry Commission a Memorandum and Schedules            setting forth the estimated deficiency arising on            a yearrs working of the industry from 16th July 1219            to 15th July 1920.                   *    (b) On 14th July 1919 a White Paper was submitted to the House            of Commons containing a statement showing the basis            upon which the increase of 6/- in the cost of coal to            the consumer was calculated, this statement being            based on the detailed information-.-in the Memorandum            and Schedules referred to above.&apos;.                                              k    (o) We append a detailed analysis and criticism of the            Memorandnm and Schedules  (Appendix No. 1).- &apos;&apos;               Our finding in regard to  them may be summarised                    as follows               (I) The estimates contained  in  them were  in respect                     of a year1s working of the  industry  from                     16th  July  1919 to 15th July 1920 (ignoring                     air/ loss arising prior to 16th  July  1919),                     and being  estimates so far ahead in  such a                     complicated  industry  could not  reasonably be                     expected  to be accurate  in view of events                     and circumstances arising after the  date the                     estimates  were made.               (2) Viewed in  the light  of  the  date then  available,                     however, we  are  of  opinion  that :-                        (a)  the  estimated  output  of  31V  million                              tons was  fair and reasonable;                        (b)  the  rate  of profit taken  as  the  basis                              for  computation,  vis:--  3/7 per ton                             raised, was  also fair  and  reasonable;                         1.
                (o) the cost of production was -under-                      estimated, especially in respect of                      wages, this cost &quot;being estimated at                       209,000,000, as compared with our  &apos; .                      figure of  216,000,000 (Schedules                      nos., 3, 5, 6 and V);                (d) the revenue was underestimated to the                      extent of about  30,000,000, mainly                      due  to an undervaluation of the pro-                      ceeds to be obtained from Exports and                      Bunkers  (Schedules Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6                      and  7).                           It would appear that Sir D. Jones                      based his export values mainly on the                      conclusion set forth in Mr Justice                      Sankey1s interim report of 20th March                      1919, that there would be a loss on                      neutral tonnage during the remainder                      of 1919 on the prices ruling at the                      date of the Report, but we do not                      think this assumption was justified.  With regard to  the  second part of our reference  &quot;To  examine and report upon the date on which the reduo-    tion by 10/- per ton of coal for household and domestic    use  is  based.&quot;-  we have to report  as follows:-(a)  The estimates under this, part of our references cover        the  financial year  from 1st April  1919 to 31st March        1920,  and are (apart from the 6/-  increase  in price        of inland ooal imposed  in July 1919) not comparable        with the  estimates  dealt with in  the first part of        our  reference, in respect that          (i)    The loss arising in the period from 1st April                  1919 to  19th  July 1919  (due mainly to  the                  operation of the Sankey Wage without cor-                  responding compensation in selling price)                  is brought into account in the second                  estimates but not in the first.          (ii)   The first  estimates cover  a period which  ex-                  tends from 16th  July 1919 to  loth  July                  1920, and the second from 1st April  1919                  to 31st  March 1920;  the estimates for                  the second period, therefore, deal more                  with fact and less with forecast.fb)  We append a detailed analysis and criticism  of  the  later        estimates (Appendix No. 2).             Our finding with regard to these may be   ,        summar  ed as follows           (i)   The estimates are  on  the  whole fair  and &apos;                  reasonable deductions  from  the  date  then                  available, although  in our  opinion an                  amendment should be  made  on the  estimated                  surplus  of  17,000,000 (Schedule  No.10)                   in respect  of the  following adjustments                     (a) an addition  of  2,500,000  should be                           made to  the  proceeds  obtainable                           from inland  sales.  (Appendix                           No.  2,  page  3.).            \       o
       We have  pleasure in stating that we have received every facility from the Officials of the Coal Mines Department in con-ducting our investigations.                       We are, Sir,                            Yours faithfully,                                 (Sd.)  HFR3D        &amp; 00.                                      Chartered Accountants.                      tb)  a deduction of  3,000,000 should be                             made  in respect  of  the difference                             between the export  and inland                             profit  on 2,000,000 tons  of  coal.                             (Appendix No.  2,  page  2.).           (ii)   The  effect of these adjustments is a  nett                   deduction of  500,000 from the  estimated                   surplus of  17,000,000, leaving  16,500,000.          (iii)   The  cost  from 1st December 1019 to 31st  llarch                   1920 of the reduction in  respect of house-                   hold coal and  the relative proportions of                   coal supplied  to gas and  electricity  under-                   taking s and in respect  of coastwise bunkers                   is  estimated at   12,6CO,000,  which we con-                   sider  approximately correct.           (iv)   The  surplus shewn in the Departments own esti-                   mate,  viz:-  4,500,000 (after  deduction of                   the  estimated  cost of reduction in prices -                    12,600,000 from the estimated  surplus of                    17,000,000) was designedly  and we think                   reasonably retained by  the Department for                   contingencies, especially because  the                   Department was in negotiation with the                   Ministry of Shipping and  the Ministry of                   Transport endeavouring  to arrange  for the                   transport of coal taken from exports  for                   inland requirements,  and  until  these  negotiations-                   ations were concluded the nett  result must                   necessarily be in doubt.(3)   In  compliance  with  your request,  made personally  on  28th        January  last, we have prepared and  attach (Appendix        Ho.  3) a provisional estimate of the  results for  the        year ended  31st  March 1920 in the light  of  the facts        so far as they are known to-day;   from which it will be        seen that in  our opinion and so far as can  be  estimated,        the  surplus remaining on the working  of  the industry        for  the  current  financial  year will be approximately         6,000,000.             This estimated surplus  of  6,000,000 as at 31st        March 1920, includes the gain accruing on the  advance        of 6/- per  ton  on  inland coal made  in July  1919,  less        the  loss in revenue resulting from  the reduction  of        19/- per ton  on  domestic and household, coal, and  the        reduction of  coastwise bunkers, from  1st December 1919.
sDETAILED MALY3I3 ana CRITICISM (with relative Schedules) relating to the first part of bar reference.(1) &quot;To examine  and  report  upon  the  White Paper  of  July 1919,        with a view  to  ascertaining  whether  the  estimates        contained  in it were  cased upon  assumptions  or deduc-        tions which  were  reasonably  and  fairly reflected in        the  information then  obtainable,&quot;       The estimates contained in the Memorandum and Schedules attachedto the White Paper of July 1919 are in respect of a yearVs working ofthe industry from. 16th July 1919 to 15th July 1920, and were in thefirst place based on an ascertained profit of 3/7.07 per ton raised on77.63$ of the total tonnage raised in the quarter ended 30th September1918.  This profit is arrived at from a summary of production and costs obtained from information supplied quarterly &quot;by Coalowners onform &quot;G&quot; issued by the Go.il Minos Department.  Those forms arerequired to be returned within 60 days of the expiry of the quarterto which they relate.  In practice, however, it is found that a,proportion of the forms are not received within the time limit, andthis delay, added to the time required for checking the forms in theDepartment, results in a complete summary of the&apos;results cf eachquarter not being available until a considerable time after the end ofthe quarter.  At the tine the estimates contained in the White paper were prepared, the latest information available was a summary of the,results in the September 1918 quarter embracing 77.63$ of the total tonnage raised.  The Collieries were divided into various divisionsaccording to district, and the results shown, while embracing in theaggregate a tonnage of 77,63$ of the total tonnage raised, include adifferent proportion of tonnage raised in each division, varying from55.81$ ,(North Derbyshire &amp; Notts) to 93.68$ (Durham).  By raising the profit she mi in each division to 100$ and applying the resultingtotal profit to the aggregate tonnage raised for the quarter, a profit of 3/7.07 per ton raised is obtained, and this figure (3/7) formed thebasis of the calculations contained in the White Paper.  It must beremembered that at the time the calculations were made the information obtained from the summary referred to was the most reliable dataavailable because it included the effect of tho last war wage and increase in price of coal.       We have examined and approve of the 3/7 per ton raised as abasis for the calculations.       We have now to consider the adjustments that wore made on thebasis figure in arriving at the estimated deficiency arising in theyoar from 16th July 1919.   Schedule No. 1 shows the working out of thoDepartment1s calculation from the basis point (as given in the white paper) and Schedules Nos.  3 and 4 an analysis of the figures betweencosts and proceeds.   Wa would romark thatwith the following statement:-the calculation starts           &quot;Ascertained profit for  the  quarter ended 30th September1918 on&quot;the basis of an output of 228,000,000 tons per annum,  the       &quot;average number of persons employed being 961,000 - 3/7       &quot;per ton.&quot;APPENDIX NO,  1.

Sir Evan Joneses not appear to have differentiated between on an odtpat of 218,367,000 tons,  and tho output of 217,000,000 tons, bat there isgard to tho other costs, a provision was made of overhead charges due to decreased output,this into aocount, we consider that.there wasQ  have, therefore, prepared Schedules (ijios. 5 our opinion the estimated costs of productionalso a Schedule (110.7) showing a comparisonthose of the Department;       Wo might here explain with regard to the estimated output of217,000,000 tons, that, as set forth7iii the White Paper (Schedulelo. 2) it was arrived at by taking the actual output of the first 20weeks in 1919, converted to an annual basis, and deducting 10$ toallow for the shortening of the working day by one hoar from the16th July 1919. ,  This 10$ was a figure&apos; taken by Mr Justice 3&apos;ankeybased on evidence given before the Coal Commission, but was ratherunder the actual loss in working time which would arise from the shorter hours.,  In estimating the total output, Mr Justice Sankeyassumed that with the increased workers in the mines there should bean annual output under the old. conditions, of about 263 million tons,or, after the deduction of 10$ for the shorter working day, an annual output of about 237 million ton3.  This was apparently based on theassumption that the standard of output in the September 1918 quarterwould be maintained.  In framing the estimate of output, however,Sir Svan Jones adopted as a basis the actual output of the first 20weeks in 1919.  The average output per man during these weeks showed a gradually decreasing rate, as compared with the September 1918quarter.  In considering the output for the first 20 weeks in 1919,it has to be kept in view&apos; that the additional men who had for themost part returned from the Armies, would naturally take some timeto get back into the old ways of working, and that the output of theseSO weeks might not fairly reflect what the increased number of men could produce when the newly returned men settled down,.  Again, aconsiderable amount of work in the way of repairs and preparingunderground, which,- owing to war conditions had not been carried, outin the usual way, would be done in these 20 weeks, and consequentlya smaller percentage of the increased number of men would be actualproducers then would be the case when the mines were restored topre-war conditions.  There is no doubt that these conditions existed,but how was a value to be placed on the loss in output arisingtherefrom in these 20 weeks?   On the other hand, the workers hadbeen In receipt of the Sankey wage for the greater part of the period,Iand the decrease in output might have been partly due to that cause.Oil the whole, keeping in view that the Department could not possibly have taken the risk of over estimating output, we consider that the[estimated output of 218,000,000 tons was a fair and reasonable one &apos;:&apos;rom the information that was available,       With regard to Owners&apos; profits, a provision of 1/2 per tonpas made on the estimate of 217,000,000 tons.  It is to be noted thatpo provision was made for interest on increased capital employed inhhe industry over the standard period, nor for wastage of capital Jxpenditore.  Those allowances wore later provided for in the Coal didustry (Smorgency) Bill, but as tho details of that Bill had lot boon deteraiinod at the data of the estimates, no criticism  in be made on that account.
Append ix No 01. (Contdc )t a     With regard to &quot;Miscollaneous Receipts,,&quot; those are excludedunder the Coal Industry (Emergency) Bill,  and as it was apparently&quot;assumed at the time tho calculations in the White Paper were made that l/2 per ton should coyer coal profits only, we think that theseMiscellaneous Receipts should have &quot;been excluded from the profitsfor the purpose of arriving at the estimated defioiency3     Provision was made in the estimate for  3,000,000 in respectof Compensation to Owners for working under the instructions of theControl.  Mines that would otherwise he abandoned.  This would appearto have been an over-estimate, as events proved, but it was obvious-ly not capable of exact assessment at the time.    &apos; We &quot;now turn to the estimated, proceeds of the output of217,000^00 tons, and Schedule N0o4o shows what in effect was theDepartment1s estimate of these proceeds0  Schedule No,6* showsour estimate.  With, regard to inland coal, a fair estimate in ouropinion would have been I52j250,,000 tons,,  The difference between this figure and that taken by Sir Evan Jones, vis:- 156,750,000tons is mainly due to his not having taken into account the reductionin the Admiralty demands from inland coal as compared with 1918.     With regard to Exports, the Department&apos;s policy apparentlywas to keep inland consumption at the 1918 level (subject to2,000j000 tons taken off domestic coal).  The point arises, whetherhaving earmarked the output In a way that would involve the inland transport coastwise or by rail of about 11,000,000 tons of coal from Export Collieries for inland use, the Department reallysatisfied itself that the proposal was practicable.  As we are considering an estimate forjone year from 16th July 1919, not anestimate of what might, evlmtually &quot;b&quot;e the increased price of coalnecessary, we consider that in making his calculations, Sir Evan Jonesshould have allowed for exports being maintained at the old ratofor at least three months.  The fact that&apos; the rate of exports has for the remainder.of 1919 been at a greater rate than the estimateof 23 million tons is due (I) to the output from September 1919increasing (there was an increasing number of men going Into thomines): (2) to the lack of transport facilities for shippingcoastwise and consequently coal having to be exported; and (3) tothe pressure placed 011  this country by our Allies for greater supplies to meet what In the case of both Prance and Italy has been desperateneed, but in criticising the estimate made in July last we mustconfine ourselves to the known facts of the time, and in our view it would have been reasonable to allow (for the reason already given) for an export figure of 26 million tons instead of 23 million tons.  We might add that ?/s do not consider that unless output fellseriously below 217 million tons, a lower rate of export than 23railllon tons could reasonably have been contemplated over any ,period, in view of the great importance of return cargoes of necessary raw material.     With regard to the piice at which exports were valued by Sir Evan Jones, we found&apos;it difficult to follow his figures, as given in the White Paper, but we are indebted to him for supplying us with a Memorandum, 022 the subject (Schedule No.9* ) and while fe cannot concur in his arguments or conclusions, we are bound in fairness  to remember that the first Sankey Report (of 20th March 919) stated that there&quot;would be for the remainder of 1919 a fall ,n export profits of  9,000,000 on the prices ruling at the date ofthe Report.
IFimPTl 110.1 (Centd),       Sir Evan Jones makes an allowance of  11,000,000 for&quot;Estimated Iocs of profit on export trade duo to reduction of exports from 34 million tons per annum to S3 million tons,&quot;This estimated loss of  11,000,000 is arrived at in the followingway :-       Approximate  analysis of the rate of profit per ton of         output for one year based on the September quarter  in 1918,           neutral Coal - 6 million tons (3 43/10   -  13,150,000           Allies  Coal - 33   ,r     &quot;   gi  3/l0   -   6.350,000                          39 at sn average rate of   Sig^olToOO                                10/-&apos; per ten.            ------       It is then assumed, for reasons stated in his memorandum that the average rate of profit for the year from 16th July 1919will be the same as in the September 1318 quarter, and that for economic reasons it might become necessary to keep supplies toFrance to the level of 1913 and maintain supplies to Italy at thesame level as In September 1918,  in consequence of this,  theneutral proportion of the 23 million tons would be reduced andthe average rate of profit of 10f- per ton would also fall.  Onthis assumption, he arrives at the following estimate of profiton exports :-            fleutral     -  2 million tons $ 43/10  -   4,000.000            Allies      - 21   w      v   e  3/10  -   4f000&apos;;000                               at an average profit23of 6/llJ-d&apos;por ton&apos;     8,000,000or  11,500,000 loss than the profit of.the September 1918 quarter,and this difference gives the  11,000,000 used in the calculationin the White paper.       In the first place, the above figures&apos;show a difference of 2 per ton in the selling price between coal exported to neutralsand other coal exported.   We cannot find any grounds for this assumption.    According to the figures given in tho Monthly Tradeand navigation Returns  fSchedula &amp;c.8t)&quot;the average fuo*b* valueof coal delivered to Sweden, Norway, Denmark,  Netherlands and spain was in the September 1918 quarter 42/8 and to South America35/-*  l&apos;he average to all neutrals was 42/- end the average to allied countries (including Admiralty coal exported) was 30/2*whose figures would he subject to a deduction to redace to pitheadurices  but a?;, this would be the same in each case, as well as thecost of production, the difference in profit between the highestneutral coal and allied etc  coal was only 12/6 and between theaverage of all neutral coal and allied etc coal only ll/lO parton,  &quot;Then in the. calculation of the profit on export coal for theyear from 16th July 1919, it is stated that 2 million tons of coalwill be sold to neutrals at a profit of 43/10 which, with thecost of production in the September 1918 quarter 20/7,.  would makea selling price of about 64/5 per ton, and tho 21 million tons &apos;will be sold to Allies etc at a profit of 3/10 making, wit it theaddition of the cost of production, a selling price of 24/5 perfcODc
(uf- j * Agpen d 1 x  No * 1.....(Ooato.),Sir E.  Jones points out that the Sankey Interim Report  gave   2 per ton as anticipated loss of profit on neutral coal in thecurrent year to which the Report relates and he goes on to saythat this  means a reduction in the annual rate of profit dueto exports on tho basis of the September 1918 quarter of 12million pounds.   Tot the September 1918 quarter only showed a selling  price of about 38/8 (48/8 less 4/-) to tho neutralspaying the highest prices, as against an estimated loss of  2 per ton on the  reduced exports.   There appears to have beena serious  error in his fugures.   This assumed loss of   8 porton profit evidently should be limited in its application andnot applied to  the whole neutral profits.   Again, in face ofthis estimated loss of profit, Sir Evan Jones&quot;assumes that the2 million  tons  to be sold to neutrals in the year from  16thJuly 1919  to 15th July 1920 will remain 64/5 per ton (43/10plus 2o/7  cost) which is about 26/- in excess of the price inthe September 1918 quarter and about 6/- in excess of the price in the quarter ended June 1919*   On the other hand the 21million tens to be sold to Allies etc is estimated to  realise24/5 por ton (3/10 plus EO/7) which is about 2/- less than theprice realised in the September 1918 quarter and about  6/6 les3than the price  in the quarter ended June 1919,   That is to saythat the effect of the abolition of tho fixed prices to allies in May 1919 was to be a fall?in price of 6/6 per ton.   Theonly thing that appears to be clear-is that in effect therewas placed on the exports in the calculations in the white paper, an average selling price of 31/9 per ton.                                                   t     In arriving at a value, to be placed on exports we  havefirst of all to consider what actually were the icxports of34.000.000 tons in 1918, i.en the year from which there wasdeducted 11,000,000 tons as estimated reduction for the year from 16th July 1919.   We are informed by the StatisticalDepartment of H.M* Customs that  there is included in thefigures idniralty and Far  Office exports amounting to 8P520,819tons.   We have also obtained from the  same source the figuresincluded in exports for the 6 months1 ended 3lst December 1918in respect of coal supplied through the Admiralty to AlliedState Railways, also manufactured fuel.   These are 2,337,163tons and 139, 920  tons respectively.    The weight cf manufac-tured fuel does not wholly represent coal but  the difference is negligible in comparison with  the total figures,    Thefigures for the first half of 1918 would probably be greaterthan those we show for  the second half  and if we  take  the total for 1918 as 5,500,000,  this, added  to  the Admiralty1sown drawings, gives a  total of  about 14,000,000 tons includedin  the 34 millions  of  exports  in  1918  on account  of purchasesmade by the Admiralty.    When we  consider that  the Admiraltydrawings had fallen  to a  very  low figure at  the  time the calculations in  the White  Paper were made, and  that  tho  draw-ings for  the Allied  State Railways had  also  dropped, and  thatit was reasonable  to anticipate that  the Admiralty requirements would rapidly fall  to  the pre-war level,  it  is  clear that  the11,000,000  tons  estimated reduction  in exports  for  the  year from  16th July  1919  could largely be mot out  of coal which  in1918 went for Admiralty purposes at  low prices  compared with the  open  market  prices  to neutrals.    It follows  then  that the amount  exported  to  neutrals could  bo maintained  without taking much from the  Allied  1918 supplies,.    The  reduction  ofcoal  to neutrals  to  2  million tons,  as anticipated  by  Sir E. Jones, ?;as  therefore  not,  in our  opinion, warranted.    Even if the Admiralty coal  had not  to a large extent met the rc- duction in  output,  we  cannot  think that it  was reasonable  to contemplate an allocation to  neutrals  of only 2 million tons cut  of  23 million tons  available.    We think it would  have been reasonable  to assume that the  exports  to neutrals could have  been maintained at 6t000,000 tons.
in our view a fair estimate of the value of the  3,000,000tons exports would have been:-Neutrals     -  6,000,000 tons $ 56/c  ^   16,800,000Allies etc,  - 17*000.000  &quot;   &quot; 46/-  S   39,100,000                          at an average               83,000,000 price of 48/7    55,, 900, 000               aratxxsw. per ton.        w^a^tm:     To the above figures there has to be added 3;000,000 tonsIn respect of coal exported until transport arrangements becameeffective (a3 mentioned on page 3*) making a total of 26,,000,000tons, which at the above average price of 48/- gives  62^400,000(as shown on Schedule No, 6).     We consider that the above prices represent what would havebeen a safe estimate to have made at the time the calculationsin the White Paper were framed.   We have taken for neutrals theaverage prices obtained in May 1919i as shown in the Trade and navigation Returns (Schedule No, 8)j viz:- 60/- (less 4/- toreduce the pithead prices) and for Allies etc.  we have takenlo/- less, viz;- 46/-,    As regards coal to Allies, we considerthat a reasonable estimate would have been that prices wouldrapidly rise from tho fixed prices, which had Just been abolished,and that they would then generally follow the course of neutralprices, but for various reasons we consider that they would notrise to the average neutral prices.   We have,  therefore, takenIn our estimate for Allies a selling price 10/- per ton belowthe estimated neutral priee*     It must be clearly understood that in taking these priceswe are dealing with the estimated results of a yearrs workingonly,   The point to consider is  :- what will be the average price for that year?   We think that it will be admitted that prices would not drop suddenly at 16th July 1919 from theprices ruling at the date the estimates were framed;  thereduction (if any) would be&quot; gradual.
APPENDS 10 o 2.&apos;t) i) cJXM1AIM ANALYSIS and CRITICISM (with relative Schedule) relating to the second part of our reference.(2)  &quot;To examine and report upon the data on which the        reduction of price &quot;by 10/- per ton of coal for        household and domestic use is based,&quot;     The estimates under the second part of our reference coyer thefinancial year ended 31st March 1920, and are therefore, apart fromthe 6/- increase in price of inland coal, not comparable with thestatement of estimated deficiency arising in the year from 16thJuly 1919, on which the increase of 6/- was based.  The statement for tho year from loth July 1919 was drawn up as an estimate of theresults of the working of the industry for that year only and theloss arising in the period from 1st April 1919, while the Ban-keywage was in^force and before the 6/- increase was imposed, was not brought into account,  Thlis loss is of course brought into account in the statement for the year to 31st March 1920.  On the other hand,the statement to 15th July 1920 covered an additional 3j monthscompared with tho second statement when American shipping facilities would be gradually improving.  The second statement therefore dealsmore with&quot;fact and loss with estimate than the first statement.Schedule No, 10 shows the abstract statement of the Department forthe year ended 31st March 1920, and the details of how the estimates of cost and production have boon arrived at.     The cost of production was estimated, with necessary adjustmention tho basis of the quarter ended 31st Itecember 1918 (the &apos;. latestjavailable date) as shown by a summary of production and cosHs pre-;pared in the same way as the summary for the quarter ended 30thSeptember 1918 referred to in the first part of our Report, andI embracing 95.92$ of the tonnage raised in that quarter.  We haveverified this summary in the same way as that for the previous quar-jter, referred to in Appendix No. 1,     The output in the Department *s estimate for the year ending31st March 1920 is 224,000,000 tons and is arrived at by takingthe actual output for the 31 weeks from the week ending 5th April1919 to the week ending 1st November 1919, and for the remainingEl wee 3 the proportionate output based on the actual output forthe 10 weeks ended 1st November 1919 (excluding the week ended4th October 1919 - Railway Strike - i.e. at an annual rate of4,502,922 tons per week and allowing half a week for ChristmasHolidays (2,251,461 tons).  We consider that the output for thelast 21 weeks of the financial year has been fairly estimated onthe basis of the 10 weeks ended 1st November 1919 (with the Adjust-  ents mentioned).  This period excluded the period of the York- shire Strike, and was as representative a period as could have wen adopted for the purpose.  It is true that the output per man showed in the last three weeks of the period an increase over the Previous weeks, but we do not consider that the Department would :iave been justified in taking this into account as a permanent Ucrease for the estimate.     The estimated wages and other costs arc&apos;arrived at as explain-  rl in Schedule 10, and we approve of them as reasonable estimates.

Having regard to e fact that a little over four&apos; months of the financial year had run we  do not  think that there could have been contemplated a insfer coastwise and. inland  of more than 2,000,000 tons.

APPENDIX 110. 2 (CozrtcL)O EL TL     In arriving at its estimated surplus of  17,000,000, theDepartment had, we understand, in view the possibility that theefforts, whioh we are satisfied it was making to obtain adequatetransport for shipping coal coastwise, as well as by rail wouldresult in less coal being exported and that in dealing with this surplus by way of reduction in prices, it reserved a margin tocover emergencies, including loss of profit arising from thereduction of export t s *     With regard to export prices, we consider that the estimated average price for the remainder of the financial year viz:- 58/6is a reasonable estimate.  This is of course in excess of whatwould have been a fair estimate at the time the calculations inthe White Paper were made (we ourselves took 48/7 as a fair esti-mate) but the Department has several months&apos; more experience togo on.  It was now also budgetting for a period ending three anda half months earlier than the period covered by the White Paper.In addition to this, the American Coal Strike undoubtedly put backtho period at which the Americans could become serious competitors.     With regard to the price taken for inland coal, there appearsto have been an under-estimate.  The average price for inland sales for the December 1918 quarter, as shown by the DepartmentTs analysisis 2g/9.92 per ton, i.e. for sales that have been classified in the&quot;G&apos;r Returns as inland sales to customers.  The average in the sum-marised returns for sales to customers, including as inland salesthose not classified in the &quot;G?t Returns is 22/10.41,  But thereare also included in the December 1918 Quarter &quot;Deliveries toother Departments&quot; 5,690,030 tons at an average price of 20/9.7.This quantity on an annual basis would be 22,760,120 tons and assuming-ing that the supplies under this head were the same for the year under review and that the price has not since been brought up tothe average of general sales, would appear to be correctly esti-mated at 20/9.  The value of inland sales would thus appear to be:-   Deliveries to other Departments -     7,670,000 tons 0 20/9 per ton........   7,957,625                    (prior to the 6/- advance)  &apos;  15,090,000  &quot;   0 26/9 per ton    ........  20,182,875  General -    42,300,000 tons m 22/10 per ton........  48,292,500                    (prior to the 6/- advance)    83,140,000  &quot;   $ 28/10 per ton   ...,   ..... 119,060,166                                                    196,293,166     The Department has taken credit for  192,800,000 or about 3,500,000 under the above figure.  We understand that the full6/- per ton was riot applied by Collieries on certain poorer classesof coal for industrial consumption, but there is no data as tothe exact amount involved.  We do not think the liability can beplaced higher than  1,000,000, and we therefore consider that 2,500,000 should be added to the value of the proceeds.     Tho Department estimated that the reduction of 10/- per, ton of coal for household and domestic use (including the proportionof coal used by Gas and Electrical Undertakings applicable to domestic consumption) would probably apply to 23,000,000 tons ofcoal for 4 months from 1st December 1919 to 31st March 1920.&quot;1 o
umaxa no. g (contd.)The proportion of ocal used for these purposes is much greater  thanthe exact tine proportion, owing to the period covered being the worst part of the winter.  There has been a tendency to increaseconsumption this winter, but from the data available we think theestimate reasonable,   Tho cost of this reduction in household and domestic (including compensation to coal merchants  in respect of stock) together with the &quot;estimated, cost of the reduction in coast-wise bunkers is estimated at  12,600,000, which we  consider appro-ximately correct.

(252) page3, (third and fourth paragraphs from the hottorn)v  Mr Lee*smemorandum was subsequently prepared after discussion with mefor tho purpose of the adjustment of the distribution and allocation of the 3.1 million tons of coal to be diverted fromexport for inland uso, in relation to the deficiencies in supply from the respective coalfields and the transport problems in-volvod, and of its allocation between tho Allied and NeutralCountriesa  It was definitely considered that, the distributionof the greater part of the 11 million tons diverted from exportwas only feasible by carrying it coastwise.,     The basis upon which tho estimate of the 23 million tons was made was simply thai of the relation of estimated output to inland consumptions  The governing consideration was that approximately the same quantity of coal must be reserved forinland consumption as was used in 1918, namely 195 million tons,but I reduced, this by 2 million tons, as after a consultationwith Mr Pick5 the former head of the Household 2*fuel  and LightingBranch; I considered the consumption of domestic coal wouldprobably be reduced by about that amount in consequence ofthe restrictions being maintained over the whole year insteadof operating only for a few months as in 1918.  I therefore took194 million tons as the estimated inland consumption for twelvemonths frsm July 1919,  This figure included colliery and miners1consumption, as well as bunkers and Admiralty consumption.  Asthe estimated output was at the rate of 217 million tons perannum for the same period, this left only &apos;23 million tonsavailable for export,,     I fully considered that the Admiralty consumption  (about15 million tons in 1918) as such would be greatly reduced, butas this consumption included not only naval coal but all bunkercoal for the requisitioned floats, I estimated that those fleetsas they were restored to mercantile use would still require thecoal formerly included in Admiralty supplies for their bunkerpurposes, and I concluded that the 1918 Admiralty consumption would still hold good, although its incidence would be altered..     I observe from, the Board of Trade published figures thatin the 4-  months up to the end of November, the output-of coalhas only been at the rate of about 213 million tons per annum,which is well under my estimate, and it should bo noted thatthe loss due to the Yorkshire Strike, the August Bank. Holidayand the Railway Strike, assuming this to be about 5 million tons,is only about 7 per cent of the period output.     As the normal percentage of loss due to holidays and strikes in average years is generally taken to be about 5 per cent, theloss therefore due to the Yorkshire and Railway Strikes is not much in excess of this average.
     IT ACORNS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR THO FACT THATIT HAS BE EN POSSIBLE TO EXPORT SINCE AUGUST AT THE RATS OF33 MILLION TONS PER ANNUM, AS THERE ARE NOT AS FAR AS I can judge FROM THE PRESS, ANY SERIOUS COMPLAINTS OF SHORTAGE for industrial PURPOSES0  IT WOULD SEEM TO BE REALLY DUE TO an actual LESSENED DEMAND FROM INDUSTRY, WHEREAS I HAD calculated that THE REVIVAL OF INDUSTRY WOULD CAUSE A DEMAND FOR MORE COAL.     IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THIS MEANS.     IN THE FIVE PRE-WAR YEARS, THE AVERAGE INLAND consumption was AT THE RATE OF 209 MILLION TONS PER ANNUM.-,  IN 1918 AT THERATE OF 196 MILLION TONS POR ANNUM,,  IN THE 4G MONTHS UP to november 1919, AT THE RATE OF 180 MILLION TONS PER ANNUM.     OF COURSE THE ADJUSTMENT DUE TO VARIATION IN STOCKS AT THEBEGINNING AND END OF THE PERIOD WOULD AFFECT THIS SOMEWHAT, BUTNOT MUCH.     AS REGARDS PRICE.  MANY FACTORS HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTOACCOUNT IN ESTIMATING THE LEVEL AT WHICH EXPORT PROFITS could be MAINTAINED.     THE ESTIMATES ON WHICH THE 6/- INCREASE IN THE PRICE OFCOAL WERE BASED, WERE THE FIGURES OF THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER OF1918 UPON WHICH ALSO THE WHOLE FINANCE OF THE SANKEY INTERIMREPORT WERE BASED.  THE AVERAGE PROFIT ON EXPORTS FOR THISPERIOD WAS IN ROUND FIGURES LB/- PER TON, AND THE QUANTITYEXPORTED IN THE PERIOD WAS AT THE RATE OF 39 MILLION TONS PERANNUM, OF WHICH NEUTRALS RECEIVED AT THE RATE OF ABOUT SIXMILLION TONS AND ALLIES AT THE RATE OF ABOUT 33 -MILLION TONS.     THE COAL SOLD TO NEUTRALS REALISED A MUCH HIGHER PROFITTHAN THAT SOLD TO ALLIES.  THE PROPORTION OF PROFIT DUE to each IS NOT SHOWN IN THE FIGURES GIVEN IN EVIDENCE TO THE SANKEYCOMMISSION BUT THE SANKEY RATERIM&apos; REPORT GAVE  2 PER TON AS ANANTICIPATED LOSS OF PROFIT ON NEUTRAL COAL IN THE CURRENT YEARTO WHICH THE REPORT REFERSC  THIS MEANT A REDUCTION IN THEANNUAL RATE OX PROFIT DUE TO EXPORTS ON THE BASIS OF the september QUARTER, OF 12 MILLION POUNDS (REDUCING THE annual rate FROM 19-1 MILLION TO 7-G- MILLIONS) WHICH ON 39 MILLION tons would LEAVE AN AVERAGE PROFIT OF ONLY 3/10 PER TON, assuming the ALLIED PRICES REMAINED THE SAME0     IT WAS EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED BY MR JUSTICE SANKEY AND HISASSESSORS THAT THE PRICE OF COAL TO NEUTRALS WOULD COME DOWNTO THE FIGURE OF THE PRICE TO ALLIES,  AS A MATTER OF FACT,SIR ARTHUR DICKINSON TOLD MO THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE,,  i therefore ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING APPROXIMATE ANALYSIS OFTHE RATE OF PROFIT PER TON OF OUTPUT FOR ONE YEAR BASED ON the september QUARTOR IN 1918.

million tons and provision for inland consumption restored tothe pre-war level.  Assuming those conditions,  the Reportestimated for a profit of 45 million pounds (or if a full year1sreduction of Neutral profits was taken instead  of nine monthsof 42 million pounds) and this profit would bo  approximatelydivided as follows:-        Exports    -  39 million tons Q 4/4d   M   8,500,000        Home       - 211    &quot;     tT   &amp; 3&quot;2d   -   33,500,000                                    Total          42,000,000     Output was,  however, falling and threatened not only to  beless than the estimate of 250 million tons,  but loss even than theannual rate of the September quarter, in which case the reduction on loss of exports oVor&apos;the year would not only bo 12 millionpounds, but in addition,  3/lOd per ton on 16 million tons (thoquantity by which tho Allied exports Would be reduced assumingan output of 217 million tons) or say, 3 million pounds, makinga total of 15 million pounds.     In the month of May, however, I recommended the Governmentto abolish the fixed pricos at which coal was sold to the Allies,and maker1 the fixed price the minimum with an open market above0I had to consider carefully what the result was likely to beand had many discussions with Mr Lee on the subject,  I came tothe conclusion that the most likely result would bo that Neutralprices would fall to the Neutral minimum (average about 55/-)and that Allied prices would go up somewhat above the Alliedminimum, but not much,  I, however, considered that whilo wowere safe in estimating that we should bo able, owing to theremoval of privileged prices, to maintain the same average rate of profit, namely 10/- per ton as in the September quarterof 1918, the probable course of events were too uncertain tojustify our reckoning on anything more,,  Many considerationspresented themselvoSo  Although the Govcrnmont had consented tothe withdrawal of the Allied privileged prices, I was by nomeans  sanguine that this position could be maintained,  Ianticipated considerable diplomatic pressure, both from Francoand Italy which might result in the Government having to give way and In the re-establishing of fixed prices.   The probability of the  increase of American  imports  to France and Italy had  alsoto be  considered, and there  ware  some  substantial grounds atthe time for  the belief  that contracts  in tnis direction were under-negotiation^  Further, the question  of reparation ooal  fromGermany to France and Italy, and  the  transfer  of  the  Saar Valleyto France were  then beginning  to  come to the front, and  if theseproposals became  effective,  the needs of France and  Italy wouldbe largely met.  On  the  whole,  I  was  satisfied  that  it  would notbe prudent to count  on a larger profit over  tho period  of a  whole year  than lo/-  per  ton.      The  average  exports of  coal  after September  1918 foil from the  rate  of  39  million  tons  per  annum to a  rate of 34 millions per  annum*   I took  the  latter  figure for my calculations, and taking 23 millions  as all  we would  have  available for export, assumed a reduction of  11 million tons instead of 16  millions i as  compared with the September quarter of  1918*    The rate  of annual profit on exports in the September  quarter ?;as 19-?r million pounds;  the anticipated rate would now be  23 million tons at 10/-  or 111 million pounds,  a reduction of  8 million pounds.
ASSUMING, HOWEVER, THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD &quot;BOON OBLIGED to restore PRIVILEGED PRICES TO ALLIES (OR THEIR EQUIVALENT)AND THAT FOR ECONOMIC REASONS IT BECAME NECESSARY TO KEEP TIPSUPPLIES TO FRANCE TO THO level OF 1913, NAMELY, 13 million tons INSTEAD OF THE 9 MILLION TONS WHICH WE HAD ALLOTTED ASPRANCE1S SHARE OF THE  3 MILLIONS, THEN, AS WE COULD NOT REDUCETHO SUPPLIES TO ITALY, WE SHOULD HAVE UOEN OBLIGED TO REDUCENEUTRAL SUPPLIES BY ABOUT 4, MILLION TONS TO MAKE UP THO quantity for FRANCE, AND AS THO HIGHER PROFIT WAS DERIVED FROM NEUTRALS(ASSUMING PRIVILEGED PRICES RESTORED) OUR LOSS OF PROFIT WOULDBE PROPORTIONATELY GREATER.     IT WAS BY NO MOANS IMPROBABLE THAT BOTH THESE EVENTS might happen.  IF SO, OUR EXPORT PROFITS WOULD HAVE BEEN AS FOLLOWS:-        NEUTRALS  -   2 MILLION TONS Q 43/LOD  M   4,000,000        ALLIES    -  21    &quot;     &quot;   &amp;  3/L0D  A   4,000,000 8,000,000OR 11-G- MILLIONS LESS THAN the RATE OF THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER IN1918,     These ARE THE FIGURES UPON WHICH I ESTIMATED THE LOSS OF 1 PER ton ON the 11 MILLION TONS OF REDUCED EXPORTS,,     I DISCUSSED, THIS FIGURE WITH SIR ARTHUR DICKINSON AND he agreed THAT  1 PER ton WOULD FAIRLY REPRESENT THE LOSS WE MIGHTANTICIPATE ON THE REDUCED QUANTITY EXPORTED,  SIR ARTHUR, HOWEVER,CONSIDERED THAT ON THE WHOLE MY ESTIMATED DEFICIENCY OF  46,000,000)WAS TWO LOW, AND HE PREPARED AN ESTIMATE OF HIS OWN ON. quite different LINES, WHICH SHOWED A DEFICIENCY IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLYOF ABOUT 53 MILLION POUNDS.  SIR Arthur DICKINSONRS ALTERNATIVEESTIMATE WILL BE FOUND AMONGST THE PAPERS.     FURTHER, it WAS AN OPEN QUESTION AT THE TIME WHETHERABNORMAL PROFITS FROM EXPORTS DUE TO ECONOMIC CAUSES ARISINGFROM the WAR AND WHICH WERE LIKELY TO BE TEMPORARY AND VERYFLUCTUATING SHOULD REALLY BE A CREDIT TO THE COAL INDUSTRY atALL.  THEY WERE PROFITS, AS FAR AS THEY WORE REALISED, OF ANATIONAL CHARACTER AND DUE TO CAUSES OUTSIDE THE COAL INDUSTRYALTOGETHER, AND WORE THEREFORE OF A NATURE WHICH IT WASCOMPETENT TO ARGUE., SHOULD go TO THE RELIEF of WAR TAXATION,AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUBSIDISING, either the OWNERS, THE MINERS OR THE CONSUMERS of COAL&apos;.  THEIR USEIN EITHER OF THOSE LATTER RESPECTS WOULD TEND TO MAINTAIN THEINDUSTRY ON AN UNECONOMIC BASIS, AND IF THEY DID NOT ACCRUEA SERIOUS DEFICIT WOULD RESULT WHICH WOULD FALL ON THEEXCHEQUER.(SIGNED)  33.7AJ D.

     Che actual output  for the  31 weeks  from the week: ending the5th April 1919 to  the week ending 1st November 1919 Is 132,108,910tons.     The estimated output for the remaining 21 weeks from theweek ending 8th November 1919 to the week ending 28th March 1920may be calculated  in various ways of which the following fourare examples     (1) Estimated on same basis as actual output for 31 weeks           i,e. at the  rate of  4 ,,261,578 tons per week, would           give 79,493,138 tons for the  21 weeks and total for           the year of   81,602.,048  tons.     (2) Estimated on the basis of  the actual output for the           last 3  weeks i,e. at the rate of 4,721,011 tons per           week, would  give 99,141,231 tons,  from this, a           deduction of half a  week5 s output for Christmas           holidays (2,300,605  tone) must be made, leaving a           total for the year of 228,889,636 tons.     (3) Estimated on the basis of  the actual output for the           10 weeks ending 1st  November  (excluding the week           ending  4th October - Railway  Strike - i.e. at an           average rate of output 4,502,928 tons per week and           again&quot;allowing half  a week for Christmas holidays          * (2,251,461 tons) the total for the year would be           224,418,811  tons.     (4) If the estimated output for the remaining SI weeks is           calculated, on the basis  of the normal week given In           the current  weekly comparative statement of output           and the 21 weeks are divided  into  11 long weeks at           4,839,000 tons per week  and 10 short weeks at           4,795,000 tons per week  the output for the year           after deducting half a week for the Christmas Holi-           days (2,398,000 tons) would be 830,899,910 tons.
