Memorandum fey the Minister Of &amp;apaur*                  A proposal was made by the representative of the           polish Government at the recent meeting of the Governing           Body of the International labour Office to the effect           that a Commission should be appointed by that body to           enquire into the labour oonditions in Soviet Russia.   A           copy of a letter by Sir Malcolm Belavingue to Sir maurice           Eankey upon the subjeot has already been circulated           fO.P. 527).                  I feel strongly that the proposal should be supported           by the British Government since the supply of trustworthy           information to the public regarding labour conditions           in Russia would do much to steady opinion*   I suggest,           therefore, that Sir Kaloolm BeleTiagne should be authorised           to support the proposal of the Polish representative at           the next meeting of the Governing Body of/International           labour Office.                                      R.S. HCRM.9th February1920.
