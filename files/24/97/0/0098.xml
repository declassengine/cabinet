INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, WASHINGTON.

Supplementary Report by Dr.G.N,Barnes.

(Circulated with reference to C. P. 377)

In continuation of the report of tho 30th December last presented by the official delegates to the International Labour Conference at Washington, I new  submit for the consideration of the Cabinet some notes on tho Draft Conventions and reoommondations adopted by the Conference and suggestions as to the action to be taken.

As stated in the previous report, six Draft Conventions and six recommendations were adopted, dealing respectively with -

(1) Eight Hours day and 48 Hours Week in Industry;

(2) Unemployment;

(3) Employment of Woman;

(4) Employment of Children;

(5) Certain Dangerous Processes.

EIGHT HOURS DAY. The Draft Convention embodies the principle of the eight hours day as well as that of the 48 hours week, but with provisions which allow considerable latitude in the application of the principle to particular industries and processes. This was a compromise arrived at between the three groups represented at the Conference - Governments, employers and workers,and as it was in general accordance with the instructions given to Us by the Cabinet and with the policy adopted by the Government in the Hours of Employment Bill introduced last Session. We felt justified in supporting it. The recognition of the 
 principle; of tho  eight hours day as well as the 48 hours vie ok gave great satisfaction to the workers *   It is doubt- ful indeed whether they would have continued to take part in the work of tho Conference if a concession had not been made to then on this point.   Tho conclusion of this Draft Convention, in which the great majority in each of the three&apos; groups at tho Conference concurred, must  e regarded as its most remarkable achiovement*      The Draft Convention, in addition to the ordinary ox- oeptions for emergency, shift working, and continuous Indus-- trios,  allows (a)  a nino hours day on some days of the week if a corresponding reduction is made on others;  (b) agree- ments between the  wsrkors and  employers&apos; organizations in exceptional cases  for modification of the eight hours limit provided the approval of the Government is given and the average number of  hours does not exceed 40;  (c)  permanent exceptions for certain kinds&apos; of work such as  preparatory work, or intermittent work;  (d)  overtime in eases of excep- tional pressure of work.   It will be seen that,  though the Convention would not allow the  samo latitude  for modifications of tho  statutory limit of hours as was proposed in the Hours of Employment Bill,  it appears  to  provide for all important exigencies that are  likely to arise in actual working in industry.    Perhaps the most important point  is the  limita- tion which is placed upon the working of overtime.     Tho                                                  wcrkers/
workers&apos; representatives generally at &quot;Vashington were  infavour of restricting overtime within narrow limits,  andthe proposal in the Convention, whioh limits overtime  toexceptional oasos of pressure of work, was accepted bothby the workers&apos; group and tho employers&apos;  group.     I would call the special attention of tho Cabinet tothe important provisions relating to tho  limitation of hours in Japan.   Those provisions oonatituto an enormousadvance on the present conditions in Japanoso Industry andv/ill bo advantageous to British trado.     I should also oall attention to one  important pointof detail.   The Convention applies only  to industrial undertakings, but the definition of &quot;industrial undertaking -ing&quot; was enlarged (on a motion of tho workers) to includeemployment at soa, subjoot to a proviso that tho provisionsrolativo to such cmploymont should bo determined by aSpecial Oonforonoo.   I opposed this whon tho motion was first moved in tho Oommittoe whioh prepared tho Convention,but as entire freedom is left to tho Special Conference todocido what regulations shall be adopted  in regard to em-ploymcnt at sea, I did not consider it necessary to prosstho matter to a voto in the full Conference *   (I understandthat it has boon arranged by ttoa Oovorning Body of the Inter-national Labour Offioe that the Special Conferenoe for                                                   seamon&apos;s/
 seamen&apos;a questions shall be held next June).      I august that the Convention should be referred to the Home Office and the Ministry of Labour to consider, and that the two Departments should be asked to report to the Cabinet on the action to be taken. lim ;:PL0Y;^NT.   The discussion of this question both. in the Committee and in the Conference took a verv wide  range/, including such natters as the distribution of the world&apos;s supply of raw material and. the regula- tion  of ocean freights.    As anticipated, however, it was not found possible at this Conference to arrive at any far-reaching conclusions.    The subject was included In the Agenda  by the- Labour Commission of the Peace  Conference with a view  to concentring attention  on one of the  most important and difficult labour questions of tho  day and preparing the way for subsequent action &quot;rather&quot;than in the  expectation that  any practical solutions would be worked out Immediately.    The Conference have,  however,  found it  jfipossible  to a^ree upon a Draft Convention embodying  proposals  for  the regular interchange of information concerning unemployment through  the Labour Office;  the establishment  of free  public  employment exchanges  and  the  co-ordination of  the  operations of free private exchanges with those  of  the  public exchanges,   the  co-ordination of  the  operations of the various national  systems;   and reciprocal  admission of foreign workers  to  the benefits of  unemployment insurance.   Sc  far as the  British  Government  is concerned,  we  saw  no objection to any of  these  proposals and gave them  ?ur  support.    The  co-ordination of public &apos;-nd private  exchanges may raise questions  of  difficulty,e.g. with some of  the trade unions, and this  will be amatter no doubt  for negotiation between the Governmentand such exchanges.   The provisions as to reciprocal                            -4-
admission  to unemployment benefits will not affect thiscountry, as no distinction is made under our law betweennative and foreign workmen:  but as the Convention recog-nisea the  principle of reciprocity on terms to be agreed between the^different^countries, it may be thought desirable  to obtain powers which will enable theGovernment to negotiate on an equal footing with other  countries.)      Of the four recoi^endations approved by theConference, we  consider the proposal to abolish privateemplo3nnent agencies of all kinds which charge fees or are carried on for profit to be impracticable anduncalled for, so far    any rav.e- as the circumstances in Great Britain a re concerned *   The proposal toimpose conditions on the recruiting of workers for employment abroad, as it stands, also appears to usto be impracticable.-.   We were unable, therefore, tosupport either of these recommendations *   The other two recommendations in favour of the establishment of a systemof unemployment insurance and reserving public work asfar as possible for periods of unemployment are theexisting policy of the Government, and were of coursesupported by us.      The Conference also submitted a recommendation infavour of the admission of foreign workers in any countryto the same benefits under the laws for the protectionof labour, and the same right of lawful organisation, asthe country1s own workers *   The history of this questionIs worth recording..   It was raised last year in theLabour Commission of the Peace Conference, and an attempt was made, by the Italian representatives in particular^to get the principle recognised in the Treaty itself *The attempt was opposed by a number of countries, includ-lng some of the British Dominions, and a somewhat colour-less provision (see Article 427, &quot;eighth point&quot;) was
 inserted instead.    On June  4th,  the  Committee at ^aria1  which dealt  with Labour  questions  after the Labour Commission  had  separatedr  proposed  the following clause Cor insertion in the  Treaties  with  the Ifaemy Powersi-        &quot;Workpeople belonging to one of the Allied          and Assoolated Powers who have  been admitted          to the territory  of ............  and their          families  will possess the rights  and          privileges  granted  to workmen nationals          by the Labour and social laws of  ..**,.*..,          and the conditions  which regulate them,          provided  that the said Allied and Associated          Po^Yer guarantees  reciprocal  treatment to          workmen admitted  to her  territories and to          their families.&quot;     .  No action was  taken  on this proposal at the time.    At  a later stage,  during the  discussion on the Austrian Treaty, the question of  inserting this clause in the Treaty was  raised again by the Italian representa- tlvesn    The Supreme Council decided  not to do 90, but to refer the question  Of reciprocity  of  treatment between  the  Allied and &quot;enemy Powers to the Washington Conference  for consideration.      At the &quot;&quot;ashington Conference, the  ItalianDelegates, basing  themselves on this  limited referenoe, raised the  original question of reciprocal treatment ingeneral.   The question w as referred to the Unemploymentt$Committee of the conference  which proposed a DraftConvention  in favour of reciprocal treatment.   This was strongly opposed by Switzerland, Holland, Canada, It was objected by the  Canadian Government delegate andothers that the question did not come within the termsof the Agenda of the conference and that the question hadnot been considered by  the Organising Committee;  that theproposal  ws Impracticable,  and that  in these circumstances it ought not to be dealt with by the Conference.   a motion to refer the question to the Governing Body forfurther  consideration  ma defeated by 26 to 47:   but a
 recommendation  in  the terms  submitted was substituted for  the proposed Convention.   We abstained from voting on the recommendation when it came before the full Conference.      It will be observed that the recommendation is safeguarded by  the provision that the terms Oh which reciprocity is.  to be jiven are to be agreed upon between the  countries concerned.      It would  probably be desirable, before any decision is taken with regard to it by the British Government, that the views of the Dominions should be ascertained* -   The recommendation is clearly outside the Agenda and  therefore outside the powers of the Conference, and I think that in strictness no obligation rests upon the  Government to take any action with regard to it:&apos;  but it will be a matter for careful consideration what course to take.      So far as Great Britain itself is concerned, the principle of course is already recognised in general.      I surest that the Drafi Convention and recommen- dations  should be referred to the Ministry of Labour for consideration and report.flOTO*S  EHPLOYMT.   Two Draft Conventions were adopted - (a) ^ith regard to the employment of women before and after childbirth;  (b) Mth regard to the employment of women at night.      The first of these Conventions prohibits the employment of a woman in any industrial or commercialundertaking during the six weeks following her confine-ment;  gives  her the right, on production of a medical certificate,  to be absent from work during the six weekspreceding her confinement;  requires the payment to her
 during  these^  weeks  of  benefits  sufficient  for  the  full and healthy maintenance of herself  and  child  and  the provision of free medical attendance..  The Convention also requires;  that a  nursing mother shall be  allowed half-an-hour twice a  day during  working hours for the purpose of nursing her  child.    These proposals met with a  considerable amount of opposition in  the  Conference and were adopted by  a-much  smaller majority than  the  other Con- ventions.    The  British official delegates  abstained from voting.      The  Convention presents considerable difficulties.    It goes  much beyond the  proposals that have been made by the Government Committees in this country which have  recently considered the subject  (t..e*. the &quot;far Cabinet Committee on v;&apos;omen in  Industry and the Re-Construction Committee on employment  of women), and It would  involve difficult and probably  controversial  legislation..   The only statutory requirement  in force  in  this country at present is the provision  in Section 61  of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, that an occupier  shall not knowingly allow  a woman to be employed in a factory or workshop within four.weeks after confinement.   The application of the Convention to commercial undertakings  in particular appears to fte to be impracticable at the present, time, and the provision as tonursing mothers  is also  considered by many people - includ- ing the British  Labour delegates - to be objectionable.      I suggest that the Convention should be referred to theHome Office and  the Ministry of Health for joint  considera-tion and report.     The Convention on the employment of women at nightfollows, in its main provisions, the Berne Convention of 19C6to which Great Britain has already adhered.   The terme ofthe original Convention have  been modified to bring it into line with the new situation created by the Labour                         -8-
      provisions of the Peace Treaty and with the  provisions      in the other Conventions.   In particular,  the      definition of the industrial undertakings  to which      it is to apply has been extended.    This will      necessitate some legislation.            I suggest that the Convention should be      referred to the Home Office  for the preparation      of the necessary legislation.(4)    CHITI)R;RN^i^HPLgp^^   Two Conventions were adopted      by the Conference - as to (a) age  of admission of      children into industry;   (b)  the employment  of young      persons under 18 at night.            (a)  Age of Admission^    The  report of  the      Organising Committee proposed that the  a-e  should  be &apos;      fixed at 14,    We were authorised  by the Cabinet to      support the  proposal and it  is  satisfactory  to be      able  to report that it was adopted by the Conference.      The alterations in the present  law which will be      necessary  are set out in my  memorandum  to the      Cabinet of last October  (G,T.  7998).            I desire to call special  attention to  the fact      that  this  Convention was also accepted  by Japan,      subject only to a provision  that children over 19.v      years of age  may be admitted to employment if they      have  finished their course in the  elementary school.           (b) At  night.   A satisfactory Convention was      also  reached on this question.   When the question      was discussed at an International  Conference  at      Berne  in 1913,  it was found  impossible  to  secure      an agreement  for the prohibition of niy,ht work      above  the  age  of 16.   Prohibition up to the  age      of 18 (as  in  the British Factory Acts) with  exceptions
for some-special cases, was adopted almost-unanimously by the Washington Conference.Subject to certain reservations for the districtsdevastated by the war,-which are to be thesubject of consideration  at a later Conference.Some minor alterations and extensions of ourpresent law will be required by the Convention.      These Conventions should be referred tothe Home Office for consideration of the necessary action.UNHEALTHY INDUSTRIES.   Pour -useful recommendationshave been made by the Conference under this heading.   The recommendation In regard toanthrax was made at our suggestion and will beof great assistance In giving effect to themeasures which are already be^ng taken bythe Home Office, on the report of theDepartmental Committee- on Anthrax, to stampout anthrax In the wool Industry.   The other measures recommended in regard to employmentof women and young persons In lead processes,the establishment of a medical branch  inconnection with, factory inspection, and the^M^trion of the Berne  Phosphorus Conventionhave already been  carried out by Great Britain.
t t649     Those reoommondations should he reforrcd to the Homo Office.     A general question arises as to tho procedure to be followed in dealing with these Convontions and recommendations.      Undor ^Article 406 of tho Treaty, it will be nocossary forthe Government within one yoar from the date of the-termination ofthe Conference to bring both tho Draft Conventions and the rooom*-mendations &quot;before the authority or authorities within whose oom-petenoe the matter lies, for tho onaotment of legislation or oth*raotion.&quot;     In the oase of matters involving legislation, the authority will be Parliament.   In the oase of matters whioh can be dealtwith by administrative action, it would perhaps be enough to referthem to the appropriate Government Department for report and for aCabinet deoision to be taken.   It may be thought better, however,to lay all tho matters, before Parliament with such advice as thegovernment consider it desirable to give.   Labour will no doubtwish to have an opportunity of discussing them.   Tho opinion ofboth Houses would tie n be taken by resolution or whatever methodwas found convenient under tho Standing Orders.   In regard to matters requiring legislation, the necessary Bills would then beprepared and introduced.     Tho Washington Conference was declared closed by the Governing3ody of the International Labour Offioe at its meeting on the 27thJanuary, and the year will run from that date.   The necessary stepsto oarry out the obligations of the Treaty will probably therefore have to be taken during the ensuing Session of Parliament.                              (Sgd)   GEORGE N.
