,,(THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OP  HIS  BRITANNIC, MAJESTY&quot; S GOVERMfiNT)     SECRET.     q,P*524ft      J          0 A  B  I  HE T,                     THE  BRITISH,MISSION  IB. mm JSmik.,...                        Note by  tho  General  Staff.                   circulated by tho Secretary of State                                 for  War.-.   Secretary of  State,          With regard to aocusations  against  the British Mission  in    .&apos;S.. Russia^  I can only say that the Mission was chosen as  follows;It      As  regards the General Staff,  very careful selection  has     invariably  been made  by the  Director  of  Staff duties.   Only  those     officers who had special qualifications  for this  class  of work     have  been appointed.          Similar care was taken  in the case  of administrative staff     officers, but  the difficulty of  finding  suitable  officers was     here  accentuated owing to the  great call for  their services     elsewhere*2.        As regards the instructional  and technical officers,     commands were  circularized for volunteers. Conditions  of     service were made clear.     The number  of  volunteers (and  it must be remembered  that     none  but volunteers could be sent)was never very  large.   The     records, both, war and pre-war  in case of regular,  officers, were     most  oarefully scrutinized,  the  General  Staff assisting the     Ad jut ant-Generals department,  and  in  many cases forwarding     specially good officers whose  names came to their notice...3.        The Mission from January  1919 to Midsummer was  a compara-     tively small  one, numbering  300  roughly  all ranks of which about     100 were officers.    These were  assembled slowly  as  the Mission -     grew  and a  proportion were sent  from  Constantinople  and Egypt.          About  August however when It  was decided to-expand the     Mission, the most urgent demands  for officers  (as  those  on the
spot were breaking down) wore made, ana although.every effort was made to icosp up the standard, there is no doubt thata few under the standard, especially in the  tochnioalservices, may have been despatched.(it must bq mentioned in&apos;passing that the4terms&apos;of serviceallowed by the Treasury wore not such as  to  render serviceparticularly attractive).     The General Staff most emphatically  resent general as Persians  of the najfcure which Sir H* Mackin&amp;er has cast uponthe Mission, ind must ask that ha will furnish full particulars of the accusations he rnaiass. They would be glad if Sir H.Mackinder would call upon thorn early for  this purpose.
