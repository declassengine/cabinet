Appendix                                       SUMMARY                                       ------0------         - It may again be recorded that there are no indications of any      active revolutionary movement in this country during the next few      weeks, although there is a good deal of underground scheming on the      part of a small minority.  It is proposed to issue information on      this subject in the form of a special report within the next few      days.  Ther6 are even signs of reaction In the labour movement      against the policy of Direct Action, and at Horwich the Locomotive      &quot;Engineers have passed a rather striking resolution against it.  If      a Government could by incantation reduce the cost of living and by      the wave of a wand exhibit houses in the oourse of erection, the      possibility of revolution would disappear for a long time.           The campaign in favour of nationalisation is far from having      been triumphant:  its leaders are discouraged and now appear to be      fixing their hopes upon the ballot box.           The recent dioclosures of profiteering in wool have produced a      remarkable outburst of resentment among working men:  it is imperative   /-v  that some effort should be made to explain the aotion of the(N&apos;-,V  Government which seems now generally to be believed to have been      in league with profiteers.           The extremists are making a bold move to7/ards wresting the      power from the constitutional leaders of labour.  They are      projecting a &quot;Rank and File Convention&quot; with a programme of whioh      the abolition of Parliament and the substitution of Soviets are      among the milder resolutions.  The Convention is to sit during the                                                                 Trade/

NATIONALISATION OP TKG MINES.          Tho almost feverish campaign in favour of nationalisation     has not met with the success anticipated by the leaders.     The campaign will end on February Oth and during the last two     weeks a very large number of meetings will be held.   In South     Wales my correspondent reports that the audiences at the     nationalisation meetings have been remarkably small; -  in     Llanbradaoh, for instance, on January  2nd only 250 people,     some of whom were small tradesmen, were counted, although     the miners in the local pits number 3,000.   An active anti-     nationalisation campaign is being conducted in South Wales.     In Durham the miners appear to be apathetic, but in other     parts of the county there have been large and enthusiastic     audiences.   There is no indication that the general public,     apart from the working  class, has been converted, and there     are even signs that the loaders are beginning to doubt     whether direct action to enforce their demands would be     successful.   Messrs. Hartshorn and Hodges have announced     that the Labour Party will move an amendment on the occasion     of the King!s speech at the opening of Parliament.   Mr.     Smillie, who is reported still to be unwell, is believed to     base his hopes of success on a Labour Government, for his     faith in direct action  is waning.   He is depressed by  the     attitude of the Railwaymen and the Transport Workers, who     appear to bo against a  general strike on  the  question of     nationalisation, on the ground that a strike would mar  their     own prospects.          It is  reported from  Leeds that there is  friction between     the leaders of the Miners1 Federation of  Great  Britain  and     those of the Yorkshire  Miners1 Association, who showed  their     coldness by absenting themselves  from the meetings  addressed     by Mr, Hodges  in Yorkshire  last v/eek.   Mr, Herbert  Smith                                                              and/
     and his lieutenants are said to be opposed to direct action     and to be working against it secretly, though they do not     dare to show their hand publicly in view of the possibility     of friction with their rank and file.THE MIC A HP HLB CONVENTION.          The National Administrative Council of the Shop     stewards  Movement, to whose activities, reference was made     in the last two reports, is issuing 4,000 copies of the     draft agenda for the Convention to Trade Union delegates.     The covering letter is signed by Sidney Horner (South Wales     Reform Committee), George Peet (Shop&apos; Stewards), F. Messer     (Scottish Workers), and T. Kime (London Shop Stewards).     The &quot;Convention Secretary&quot; is &quot;Nurse&quot; M.F. Hebbes, who     writes from Miss Sylvia Pankhursfs.creche, 433, Old Ford     Road.   The Convention Is to be held throughout the sittings     of the Trade Union Congress in February, in order to regista     the opinion of British Labour on intervention in Russia and     other questions.          The agenda, beginning with an expression of solidarity     with the Soviet Government in Russia, urges delegates to     support a general strike to stop intervention; to demand     independence for Ireland and the withdrawal of troops;  to     demand the independence of India and Egypt, the overthrow     of the entire Capitalistic structure and the establishmentj     a Communist Government, and the rejection of nationalisatiol     for a scheme of control,by the workers.   This oomprehensil     scheme is not enough:   Parliament is to be abolished and  I     Soviets immediately established;   Trade Unions in their     present form are also  to go.         &apos;This ^Convention&quot; aims directly at the recognised   lj     Trade Union leaders,  and it will be interesting to see what     amount of support it will be able to evoke.   The movement     will be carefully watched.
A HEALTHY REACTION AGAINST DIRECT ACTION.          It is satisfactory to be able to record any sign of     revolt on the part of Labour against direct action for     political ends.   At a large special meeting of the Horwioh     branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engine Drivers end     Firemen on January 18th, tho following resolution was passed     bv a l&amp;rge majority:                &quot;That this meeting of Locomotive Drivers and           Firemen strongly condemns the action of our Trade           Union leaders in calling together a special           Conference of the Trade Union Congress for purely           political purposes, seeing that the old world has           passed away and that the nation is still in chaos,           while we welcome new ideas, wo must act in a           constitutional manner, seeing that all political           parties during the Great War combined together to           overthrow e powerful enemy; that instead of asking           the members through their branches if they are           prepared to strike along with other Trade Unions to           enforce the Government to nationalise the mines,    &apos;           to withdraw our troops from Russia and to abolish           Conscription, we think their time would be better           spent in trying to reconstruct the country back in           a state of real prosperity by all classes working           together, instead of harassing the Government as           much as they can by bringing direct action into these           questions.  It would amount to civil war.  We are           also not prepared to strike for anything; that should           be done through the ballot box.&quot;                                                   Such/THE GROWTH OP AND REVOLUTIONARY gggg IN TRAjDgS UNIONISM          The membership figures of trade unions for the year     1910 show an increase of 19$ as compared with 1917,   There     are reported to bo 1220 British unions with a membership of     6,624,000 as compared with one of 5,547,000 at the end of     1917,   Tho women members  have increased by one-third and     now number about 1,250,000; the number of agricultural     labourers has more than doubled.   General labour has more     than treblod since the beginning of the war.          A prominent Trades Union leader places tho proportion     of revolutionary trades unionists at 10$ of the total     membership.   He states that during last year, fooling has     been moving from right to left; he considers that the high     water mark of revolutionary feeling was reached about July     last.
-4   *rt          Such expressions of opinion in an important Union     are apt to be infectious.THE MEOUR PARTY Aflfl .100335 TO POWER          Although the Labour Party continues to gain adherents,     thero is some dissension in its own ranks, caused principally     by tho Independent Labour Party.  One of the strongest     arguments in favour of a Labour Government as a stabilising     influence is that its access to power would put an end to     the present unhealthy attitude of deference with which Labour     men are treated both outside and inside the House of Commons,     The ordinary Labour man would be less suspicious if those who     disagreed with him took off their gloves and fought him.  He     has never failed to appreciate an antagonist who uses towards     him the pointed languago to which he is accustomed from his     mates.          It is not to be assumed that the Independent Labour     Party itself is united.  At a private meeting on January  3rd,     Mr. Ramsay Maodonald saiS that his party is striving for a     conference with the Left elements in Germany and Austria, in     order to agree upon a formula.  Paragraphs in the &quot;Forward&quot;     and the &quot;Socialist&quot; show clearly the rift in the party ranks.     In the &quot;Forward&quot; of January 17th, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald     deploros the adherence of the Scottish Conference to the     Third (Moscow) International, which he thints may set back     the influence of the party.  He mentions that in the Spen     Tfc.lley election Independent Labour Party speakers were kept     off the platform for fear of antagonising the electors, who     apparently are prejudiced against them as a. whole on account     of tho extravagances of a few..  On the other hand, the     &quot;Socialist&quot; of January 10th contains an article jeering at .\*.  Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and Mr. Arthur Henderson about the     incident of the Scottish members having joined the Moscow     International.                                                   ,  THE/

According to the &quot;Daily     Herald&quot;, the Poplar Borough Council decided.on January 82nd,     at the instance of Alderman John Scurr, to withhold the     Councils contribution to the Metropolitan Police Rate -      23,067 - until the police strikers, are. reinstated.PRQ^ITSSRTO          The feeling aroused by the disclosures of profits     mado in tho woollen industry has overshadowed all other     questions.  Speaking at Ashton-un&amp;er-Lyno, Mr. dynes said     that the press disclosures of profits were doing more to     sow the seeds of revolution than any speeches delivered on     labour platforms.  It is imperative that the Government case     should be explained without delay, since.there is a     widespread beliof among working men that the Government will     condone -the acts of profiteers as long as it has had a     share of the spoil.  In every part of the Kingdom one finds     the opinion that while prosecutions for petty little     over-charges are being brought against small retailers the     big Trusts are allowed to go unpunished.PE5LIHG AMONG EX-SERVICE-MEN          The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is creating mischief amongst men of     tho &quot;2&quot;/Reserve.  On January 24th it published a paragraph     advising an.agitation against the&quot;Class-&quot;2&quot; Reserve being     called up for military purposes, if not &quot;it will bo too late     and back to tho slaughtor will go the Class &quot;.?,&quot; Reservist.&quot;     My Leeds correspondent reports that there will be serious     trouble in. his neighbourhood if men of this Reserve are                                                     re-called/

IN ROTHERHAM          Fred Hedley, a naval deserter, has arrived in Rotherha     and has announced that he Is going to stay there with his     followers, whom he terms the &quot;Red Guard&quot; until tho revolutii     Ho has addressed meetings of from 200 - 400 people and is     usually accompanied by a revolutionary named Bown, the edit     of the local &quot;Worker.&quot;          Hedley denounced in violent language tho police who     endeavoured to keep order at his meetings; reports of his     speeches, of which extracts are given below, have been     sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions for eonsiderati     January 16th               &quot;During the war I was on a British Submarine          Chaser.  We deliberately - by instructions - sank          some of our own submarines - our own, mark you - not          Germans.   What was this done for?  Simply to keep up          the hatred between the British and German working          men.  The poor devils who went to the bottom did          not know, and the Capitalist Press would simply add          ono more vessel l03t through enemy action.&quot;     January, 17 th               &quot;We are here to organise the Red Army, and if          the Government- can get the White Army up against us,          then by God they will find I can use a machine gun,          or load a 12 pounder, or stoke a boiler in a battle-          ship.  Tho working classes want to do the same here          as they have clone in Russia3  Thoy have got the          Boss on the run there.  We should have to fight the          Police and the Army: we should bo up against the          Government and the Welsh Magician, but we can raise          an army.  I can use a machine gun if it is necessary.&apos;     January 19th                                             (J               &quot;You have heard reports of raids on different          towns on the East Coast such as Scarborough,          Hartlepool and other places.

THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CLUB          This Club, a successor to the old Communist Club,     is In grave financial difficulties.  Very few shares have     been taken up by the members, who &quot;want a first-class Club     but object to paying for it.&quot;  Unless some money is     forthcoming the mortgagee is likely to foreclose.MR. GEORGE IJINBBURY          Mr. Danebury has been visiting M, Litvinoff in     Copenhagen, and Vie has now left for Stockholm en route     for Helsingfors.  He is said to have obtained from     Lit vino ff permission to make a long st^jr in Russia.  In     an interview he stated that&quot; his party is strongly opposed     to making the Border States a bulwark against Bolshevism.MR. JOHN MoLEAN          It has long been obvious to the ordinary observer     that John McLean is insane; his colleagues have now come     to the same conclusion as a result of,his constant     references to &quot;spies&quot; being present at public and private     meetings:  Tho decisive point was his severance from the     Labour College at Glasgow and his abuse/of his former     colleagues.SINN FEIN IN- GREAT BRITAIN          Irishmen in London are devoting much attention to     the forthcoming Albert Hall meeting, which they regard     with mixed feelings owing to the possibilities of a small     audience and of opposition.  Arrangements have been made     to distributo handbills advocating.the.peeting at every     Roman Catholic Church within a 25 mile radius of London.     A large number of priests have been circularised, as have     the principals of all the Convents and Colleges in the     London area.  Concerts are being held to raise the                                                         necessary
     necessary money;  50 deposit hag &quot;been paid and a further     sum of  100 is being raised by branches of the Gaelic     Leagues and the. Irish -Self-Determination League,  It is     announced that the chief speakers will be Arthur Griffith, ^     William O^Brien, Countess Markioviea and 3)oin McNeill.          Complaints are frequent that much of the money     subscribed in London, as in Liverpool, to the Irish     National Loan is not going further than the collectors1     pockets.          It is reported that there is an -active Sinn.Fein     organisation in Yorkshire, which has its centre in     Sheffield.  A Catholic priest in that city.has formed     committees and is holding secret meetings in Rotherham,     Dalton, Sfeltby and Dinnington and is said to be a dangerous!     agitator,          A branch of the Irish 3elf-Determination League has beef     formed In Normanton and two additional branches are in     process of formation at Bradford.  ;        In Liverpool efforts -..re being made to enrol the more     respectable Irish element by means of musical clubs.          The Irish Lrbour B:-.rty in Glasgow is making considerate     headway; it is reported to be taking over the military     side of Sinn Fein and to h^ve arranged to&quot; carry out the   -  training of the Sinn Fein volunteers.  It has agreed to     grant financial and moral support to the International Uhloil                                                                i     of Kr.-Service Men as &quot;a militant organisation for the  ,,     overthrow of militarism and capitalism.&quot;          A new branch has been formed to cover the parishes of     St. Joseph, St.. Columbia and St. Alwyn.IRELAND                                                  ,       I          L&apos;*.at week there was a slight decrease&apos;in Sinn  Foin    I     outrages, especially in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  The I                                                   -slight/
slight decrease can he entirely attributed to Sinn Feinbeing fully occupied with the elections.  A police barrackwas attacked at Drombane (Co. Tipperary) by a large band of armed men,  This is now the seventh barrack upon which alarge scale attack has been made in the past few weeks.     The motor permit strike pickets have been active inthe provinces.  Cn two occasions parties of ladies andgentlemen have been held up on their way to danoes and forced to leave their vehicles which were destroyed orinjure!.     The result of the municipal elections in Dublin andthe provinces, excluding Ulster, leaves Sinn Fein with a                        onemajority ovor any  other/party, but it remains to beseon whether labour, which received the next highestnumber of votes, will join forces with Sinn Fein and thusform a working majority.  On the whole it is probable thatSinn Fein did not receive as many votes as they expocted.In Ulster the Unionists secured roughly half the totalnumber of scats obtainable.     At Cork City demobilised soldiers resented thepresence of a Sinn Fein picket at one of the pollingstations in $rattan Street and quickly dispersed them withtheir fists.  Shortly afterwards another party of sinn feiners armed with revolvers appoared on the scene.  a fight ensued and the Sinn Feiners were eventually drivenoff, but not before they had fired several shots at closerange and inflicted a bullet wound on one ex-soldier.
appendix the RUSSIAN OO-QPEBAIIYE MOVEMENT     In view of the r8lo which the Russian Co-cperativeSocieties will shortly play in British and Europeanpolitics and of the attitude of British Labour to theRussian question, some details of the organisation aroof interest; they, are taken in part.from materialsupplied to the current issue of &quot;The Co-operativeNews&quot; by Mr. Frederick Rockell, joint secretary ofthe Russo-Brltish Co-operative Information Bureau.          &quot;La Russia, in all metters of trade and     industry, the Co-operative movement has become     supreme ...... Capitalistic trading has     practically become non-existent in Russia.  This     is not altogether due to Bolshevik rule.  The     breakdown of capitalistic trading was already     in progress before the Bolshevik Revolution put     the Soviet system into power.  Capitalist trade     and industry in Russia were run very largely on     a purely local basis.  Thus, when the transport     system broke down,  and this breakdown had     already occurred before the first revolution, the     private traders had no organised national system     capable of dealing with the difficult situation     which had arisen.          &quot;But oc-operation at least had the rudiments     of such an organisation.   Scattered throughout     Russia were a number of separate and distinct     Wholesale Societies - called Unions in Russia -     and at about the time when the Russo-British-     Co-operative Bureau came into existence, this call     for greater unity resulted in turning the Moscow     Union of Consumers&apos;  Societies into the All-Russian     Union.  The various local Russian Wholesale     Societies became federated into one huge concern     operating throughout Russia.  Similarly in     Siberia, there were a numbor of local or district     Unions of butter-making co-operative societies     outside the Union of Siberian Creamery Associations,     and these were federated into the Union of     Siberian Co-operative Unions - or the Zakupsbyt,     which, in turn, is federated with the All-Russian     Union.          &quot;Credit societies for giving banking     facilities to societies of peasant producers had     long existed throughout,Russia; the&apos;organisation which/
     which knit them together was the Moscow Barotoy bank.          &quot;Narodny Bank literally means &quot;People&apos;s Bank1,     but more properly translated &apos;Oo-opotative Bank1.     Just as private trading broke down in Russia, so also     did private banking collapse; especially after the     revolution.  The bulk of the population in Russia are     peasants, and the majority of these are co-operators.     They had no confidence in tho private banks, and even     the bourgeoisie began to draw out their money from     the private banks and to place it for safe keeping     with the Co-operative Bank.          &quot;Distribution, production, and banking are all     very much interwoven in the co-operative movement of     Russia.  The Controsoyus, or Russian Wholesale, has     vast productive undertakings.  The Zakupsbpt is     concerned with selling its raombers&apos;  produce as well     as supplying theg^wlth goods.  The Naroc^iy Bank helps     to finance not only the consumers&apos;  societies but also     the agricultiiral producers; besides supplying them wi&apos;     seeds,  manures, and agricultural Implements.          &quot;There has recently been established the     &apos;Selskosoyus&apos;  or All-Russian Purchasing Union of     Agricultural Co-operation.  Then there is the Central     Association of Flax Growers, the Northern Union of     Co-operative Timber Associations, and the Union of     Co-operative Tar Manufacturing Associations.  Besides     these,  there are widespread co-operative organisations     for dealing separately with eggs, potatoes, and grain,     as well as the long-established butter-making     co-operative organisations in Siberia.          &quot;The Russo-British Bureau is not itself a trading     organisation.   It is an information Bureau.  Actual     trade is outside its province.  But the Wholesale     Societies of England, Scotland, and Ireland are member     of the  Bureau, which is useful in serving as a sort of     clearing house of views on trade from the respective     points  of view of Russian and British co-operation.&quot;     The following facts and figures were given by Mr. A.M.Azantcheyev, spokesman of the Russian delegation to theInternational Co-operative Congress  in Paris in*June, 1919.          &quot;The exact figure of actual members of     distributive co-operation on December 31st, 1918,     stood at 10,269,757; at present it has increased to     nearly 12,000,000.  This refers to the number of heads!     of families only,  and counting  each family as consist!)     of five persons, we realise that about 50,000,000     persons, or about a third of the population of pre-war     Russia, has entrusted to co-operation their provisionij     with prime necessaries.  I must add that about 80 per     cent of the membership of the movement is formed of     peasants.          &quot;The above mentioned 12,000,000 persons are &apos;    i     organised in approximately 25,000 individual co-operai     distributive societies, of which 20 societies countover/
over 10,000 members each, while the Moscow distributivestore, &apos;Zooporatsia&apos;, counts over 210,000 actual members.     &quot;In their turn, these distributive sociotioo are organised into local unions, of which thore are atpresent about 500, and these local unions are againunited in the All-Ruseian Central Union of Consumers&apos;Societies, &quot;The Centro-Soyuz&quot;.     &quot;The capital of our Central Union amounts toabout 100,000,000 roubles, while our total turnoverduring 1918 reached 1,000,000,000 roubles.     &quot;Co-operative industries,  in othor wordsindustrial undertakings controlled by various co-operative organisations, are steadily growing in numbers and importance, from the point  of view of the quantityof goods they are bringing to the market.  Tho yearlyoutput of the undertakings owned by the All-RussianCentral Union of Consumers1 Societies representscommodities valued at 150,000,000 roubles.     &quot;The Russian co-operative  organisations publishovor 200 periodical publications, many of which areillustrated papers, and also over 10,000 books and over ,000,000 copies of pamphlets and booklets per year.&quot;TH3 MOSCOW NARODNY BANK     According to the recently issued &quot;People1s Year Book(the Co-operative Annual):          &quot;The position of  the Moscow Narodny Bank at the     beginning of 1919 is shown by  tho approximate estimate     of over 9,000 co-operative organisations owning     202,307 shares representing a  total capital of     50,738,500 roubles;  while the  expansion of affairs  is     indicated by tho increase of branches in 1917-18 from     two to 36,  by the increase of  the deposit and current     accounts from 33,000,000  roubles to 677,000,000 between     January 1st, 1917,  and August  1st,  1918, and the total     of the balance sheot,  which amounted to 1,283,000,000     roubles on November 1st,  1918,  as compared with     83,000,000 roubles on  January  1st,  1917.  As between     January 1st, 1917,  and November 1st,  1918, the credit     afforded by the bank to cooperative societies rose     from 33,000,000 roubles to 174,000,000.  It should also     be stated that the value  of articles supplied by the     Goods Department of tho Bank to co-oporative societies     amounted to 46,799,000 roubles  for the period January-     October in 1918 - a sum which  may be compared with  the     volume of trading transactions  in 1914 and 1916,  when     the yoar&apos;s figures stood  at 897,400 and 15,378,300     roubles,  respectively.&quot;
