Agitatorsare malting the most of the high cost of living and the housingdifficulty, and there is also an inclination among the MiddleClasses towards the Labour Party.     A more moderate view of the Bolsheviks in Russia isnoticeable, and in extremist circles there is a greaterinclination to believe a Soviet form of Government to be practicable in England.  Lenin&apos;s letter, quoted In Report No. 38,has produced a movement in favour of reconciliation between thevarious extreme leaders.     The secret meeting of Communists in Holland is ending thisweek and the English delegates, Sylvia Pankhurst, Hodgson andYifillis are returning.  According to a trustworthy report theyare bringing back with them a considerable sum of money.     In ths Labour world generally there is the same tendency to demand more pay and less work.     Mr. J.H. Thomas appears to be losing ground with the railwaymen.  Many of the men profess to believe that he is inthe pay of the Government.     In several parts of the country an attempt is being made to solve the housing difficulty by means of direct labour.                                                Revolutionaries/
r-Revolutionaries seem to think that this is a step in  thedirection of Communist production.      William Gallachor has written an interesting comment onthe revolutionary movement in Great Britain.     Charles Hease, to whom frequent reference has been madelthese reports, has been remanded without bail on a charge ofobtaining  10,000 on false pretences.
                                                            CJL d toTKB1 NATIONALISATION OF THIS          The present position seems to he as follows          A large majority of miners - some miners put the     figures at 90$ - is in favour of nationalisation, but  the     public is apathetic.  Mr. Bwanh, M.P., who has addressed,     many meetings, admitted that though the campaign was going     well from the point of view of attendance at his meetings,     he did not feel that a great number of converts had been     made.  Too much importance need not be attached to Mr. Hodges1     circular concerning increased contributions which may  be     necessary because the miners &quot;may be involved in a national     strike,&quot; for it is clear that the loaders regard a strike     as a double-edged weapon.  Whatever may be the result  of     the interview between the ?rime Minister and the labour     Representatives, it seems certain that no drastic action     will be taken until after the meeting; of the Special Trade     Union Congress, provisionally fixed for February 20th.          In Derbyshire, where nationalised ion meetings have     been badly attended, revolutionary feeling is rapidly     increasing.  Kost of the miners1 agents are extremists and     advocates of Bolshevism, and their speeches are well received,     whereas allusions to Bolshevism were received in silence     six months a&amp;o.  A meeting held  by Mt-jor Waring-, 3i?,, at     Chopwell was practically broken up by the local miners,  who     sang the &quot;Bed Flag&quot; aid  cheered  lenin and the Russian  Soviet.     Their extremist  leader is President of  the North Eastern     Labour  College-classes.PROFITEERING AND HIGH PRIORS          It is not necessary to  labour the  point  that  high     &quot;prices  are the principal cause  of the drift  of  Labour  to     the Left Wing and.  of the middle  classes to  Labour.   The     impending  increase  in  the cost  of foodstuffs  and petrol                                                          will/
     will aggravate the position.  The average working man imon     little and cares less about foreign exchange:   his real     concern is his weekly budget.   Foolish as they are in many     directions, the extremists have grasped this fact and hope;     to  turn it to great account in bringing about  the upheaval     which had begun to seem remote.          Keighloy (No. 2) branch of the Society of Otoolmatera     has appealed to all organised workers to &quot;divert their     attention from the chimerical advantages of further incre     in  wages,&quot; and to use their industrial and political     strength &quot;to fight against the profiteering tyrannies of     Capital, and by so doing help to solidify our  ranks for     the final onslaught that is necessary to realise the idea     of  the Co-operative Commonwealth.&quot;          The Independent Labour Party is circulating an     exposure of profits in the wool trade in the form of a     pamphlet, and a leaflet, entitled &quot;The Anti-Profiteer&quot; or     &quot;MackinderTs Election News&quot;, is being widely distributed     in  the Bradford district.  Tho exposures have evoked the     usual demand for nationalisation.THE HOUSING QUESTION   \          Several towns are trying to solye the housing proble     by &quot;direct labour.&quot;  In Manchester, where, the movement     began, representatives from eleven trades have  formed a     Building Guild Committee, composed of S*G. Hobson, an     authority  on Guild Socialism, and a number of Trade Unio     officials.  A similar Guild Committee is being  formed at     Warringten, and the  idea  is being discussed in  Birmingha     and Liverpool.  The  London Guildsmen, led by Mr&apos;,  J.H.L.     hope to make the movement national.   It  is stated that     Bethnal Green already has plans passed  and a Council                                                       meeti
                              -s-                         493     meeting is  to be held to commence  direct building.          On January 25th, at a meeting of  the British  Socialist     Party Councillors at Chendos Hall, Councillor  Bfetchelor     showed that extremists hope to  profit  by the housing     difficulties.  He said that at  present it is not practicable     to seize the land:  it will have to be paid for; but if     the municipalities acquired plant  and  employed direct labour     it was a stop towards eliminating  the  capitalist and bringing     about revolution.RESTSICTIOH Off, OUTPUT,         .  -          A very frank plea for the  &quot;ca1canny&quot; policy appears     in &quot;The (Merthyr) Pioneer&quot; of January  84th from the pen     of the extremist, A.J. Cook, who has recently been elected     additional miners1 agent for Bhondda Ho. 1 District.  He     considers that his election is  due to the recognition by     the miiiers that &quot;a great social revolution is..impending,&quot;     and that capitalism  is doomed;  he continues, &quot;Hot   &quot;more     production but  rless production&apos;  until we bring  the     tottering edifice of capitalism to the groundJ  In order     to do that I have always advocated 1ca&apos;canny1  as  a means     of &apos;saboting&apos;  the capitalist out  of the mining industry.     I shall continue  to  advocate that policy.&quot;         ,.My Newcastle- correspondent reports that cases of     ioa1 canny1 have occurred ar;ong the local moulders and     pattern makers.   It  has hitherto  been the custom at a     foundry in Gateshead for the moulders to start work at     midnight on Friday,  if a casting  were required before IE     noon  on Saturday, closing  time; it has now been decided     that  under no  circumstances shall the moulders begin work     before  7.30 a0m.  on  Saturday.  At other  foundries  the     practice of working  overtime to finish a casting has been     discontinued.                                                    Lowal/
          local branches of  the United Patternmakers Associatl     have also decided to discontinue overtime as  their demand     for a minimum wage of  5 per wekk was refused by the     employers.SOVIET VERSUS EARLIAMTT          In London alone during last week meetings, with an     aggregate audience cf over 3,000, have listened to speech     in favour cf the Soviet form of Government without any     dissent.  If the audiences in other parts of the country     were added, the number would be considerable.  The London     speakers, with few exceptions, use moderate language, but     the attitude towards the Russian Bolsheviks has undoubted     begun to change.  The extremists are still but a small     proportion of the population, but they are well-organised     and increasingly bold.EXTREMISTS IN TEIB WEST OF YOEKSBIRB          West Yorkshire is at present the most active centre     of revolutionary feeling.  Luring the past week BrailsfQ]     was speaking at Ruddersfield, Tom Mann at Sheffield, and     David Kirkwcod at Bradford, where his meeting was advert.     on red bills on the Corporation Tramways,  Councillor TOD     Myers,  M.P.,  has made himself very prominent since his     election.  Mr.  Mackinder continues his &quot;exposures&quot; of     profiteering in the wool trade and Coates has been speak     on the Russian question.  My correspondent reports a gro     in the membership of the Independent Labour Party,  the     Socialist Labour Party,  and the British Socialist Party,     and a steady sale of extremist literature.                                                     AN/
mm - Q , . -AN ATTEMPT TO UNIFY REVOLUTIONAFi BODIES IN GREAT BRITAIN      The letter from Lenin,  quoted  in ray penultimate  report No,  38,  appears already to be bearing fruit.   The quarrels between extremist leaders have hitherto  been  a safeguard  to constitutional government, and an attempt  is  now to be made to sink all their differences.&apos;  In  the,current issue  of&apos;&quot;The Worker&quot; there is an article by J, R,  Campbell, co- Editor,  with Gallaeher, ox the pamphlat  &quot;Direct Action&quot;, on &quot;Lenin and Communist Unity&quot;,  which shows the great prestige which attaches to Lenin&apos;s  name.   The irreconcilables still cling to ,their polioy  of abstaining  from Parliamentary Elections,  but Lenin&apos;s suggested compromise of having two Parties  working together, the one inside and  the other outside  Parliament,  seems to be finding  favour.  The following letter from William Gallacher  written from the address  of the Scottish Workers&apos; Council,  is  worth quoting:           &quot;There appears to  be a very grave misunderstanding      regarding tho movement  here and  the value.&apos; of      Parliamentary action.           &quot;The above Council is definitely anti-parliamen-      tarian and has  behind it the left wing of different      political bodies,  .           &quot;We represent the  revolutionary  movement in      Seotland striving continually  to build up a revolutionary      organisation within the industries  and a communist      party based on.Social Committees throughout the  country.           &quot;For a considerable time  we have been sparring   -   with the official Parliamentarians.   We  have not      considered it necessary to declare  open  warfare  on      them;  and they are afraid to open an  attack on us,           &quot;But this  state of affairs  cannot long continue,      we  are winning  all along the line.  The  Rank and Pile      of  the I.L.PC  in Scotland is becoming more and more      disgusted with  the thought of  Parliament and the Soviet      and Workers&apos;  Council is being  supported  by almost      every branch.           &quot;This is very serious of  course, for the gentlemen      who look to politics for a profession and they are      using any and every means to persuade their members  to      come back into  the Parliamentary fold.                                              Revolutionary/
                &quot;Revolutionary comrades must  not  give  any support           to  this gang.   Our fight here  is going to be  a           difficult one.  One of  the worst features of  it will           be  the treachery of those to whom  personal  ambition is           a more impelling force  than their  regard for  the           Revolution.                &quot;Any support given to Parliamentarism  is simply           assisting to put power  into the hands  of our  British           Soheidemanns and Koskes.  Henderson, Clynes &amp; Co. are           hopeleBSly reactionary.  The official  I.L.P.  is more           and more coming under the control  of middle-class           liberals, who since the rout of the liberal Party have           found their &apos;spiritual home&apos; in the camp of McDonald,           Snowden &amp; Co.   The official I.L.P. is  bitterly hostile ti           the Third International, the Rank  and  Pile  in Scotland           is for it; any  support to the Parliamentary opportunists           is simply playing into the hands of the former.               &quot;The British Socialist Party  doesn&apos;t count at all          here.  I say this as one who has been  a member since its           inception.  Por long it has been drifting around without          a policy of any kind, but now it is firmly  embedded on          the recks, and  it Is only a question of time  (and a very           short time at that) till it breaks up  completely.  What          iB wanted here  is a sound revolutionary industrial          organisation, and a Communist Party werking along clear,          well defined scientific lines.  If our Comrades can          assist us in modelling these, we will  take  their help          gladly; if they cannot t for God&apos;s  sake let  them keep          tart altogether lest they betray the Revolution by          lending their support to the reactionaries  who are so          eagerly elamouring for Parliamentary honours&apos; and who          are so anxious to prove that they can  rule  as  effectivel]          as the &apos; Boss1 Class Politicians themselves.&quot;THE COHFERBHCe 0? THIS WELSH INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY         On January 31st,  at Cardiff,  the Welsh Divisional Council    of the Independent Labour Party passed a resolution  to join thi    Third Moscow International  in defiance of the pronouncements    of Messrs. Ramsay Macdonald and Snowden speaking  on behalf of    the national body.  Another resolution expressed;a preference    for industrial  rather than  geographical representation,  but   I    admitted the necessity at present &quot;for continuing the use  of I    the present machinery as the means for securing the ultimate  I    goal.&quot;  Among the other resolutions was one that   &quot;no office   j    should be accepted by any Labour Member of Parliament.&quot;THE POLICE STRIKERS         Ex-Sergeant Taylor has been elected to the City Council    in Birmingham, and the question of reinstatement is likely                                                          again/
    again to bo discussed by that Council.         Lambeth Borough Council has followed the example of    Poplar in declining to pay the police rate, amounting to about     50,000.         The Police strikers are now starting a lottery.  The    appeal appears in the current issue of &quot;The Call&quot;, and is    addressed tc. socialists.  The prizes range from  250 to    5s. Od.  It is unlikely to meet with much response.THE &quot;HMDS OPOUSSIA; MOVEMENT          Agitation in connection with this movement is proceeding    at Leeds.  On January 31st W.P. Coates announced that General    Geugh and Commander Grenfcll had given him permission to    book them for as many meetings as he wished,  lieutenant    Commander Kenv/wellworthy, M.P., and Councillor Tom Myers, M.P.,    are to address a demonstration in Bradford cn Fobruary Sth.    Mr. Coates further stated that Lieutenant Commander Kenwcrthy    had written from Ceperhagen accusing the Poles of.invading    Russian territory at the instigation of the Allied Missions in    the hope that it would prove to be a casus belli.ANOTHER resolution AGAINST DIRECT ACTION          It will be remembered that Mr. J. Bromley, of the    Locomotive Enginemen and firemen, sent a circular to all    branches te ascertain whether they would strike un Nationalisati    Peace with Russia and Conscription.  On January 25th the Crewe    Branch passed the following resolution:              &quot;We, the members of the Crewe branch, turn         &quot;down the latter cf J. Bromley as being of too         &quot;political a nature, and decide to take no action  .         &quot;whatever regarding the contents.&quot;JSC-LIEUTENANT NICHOLSON         It is reported that ex-Lieutenant Nicholson, who has    made himself so conspicuous at Reading, is breaking away from    the National Union of Ex-Service Men in order to form a                                                          Sailors&apos;/
    Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Commune, to be affiliated    with the Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committee.  It is not    known yet whether he has much following, but he seems likely    to prove a very bad influence.CONVICTIONS         On January 30th two Swedish seauen named Carl Gunnarsso    and Honning 3eeth were each sentenced at Edinburgh to six    months&apos; Imprisonment for being in possession of about 500    pamphlets issued by the Russian Revolutionary Society,    Petrograd.  The pamphlets were said to be destined for the    Leith branch of the Independent Labour Party.SINN FEIN IN GREAT, BRITAIN         My correspondent at Glasgow v/ho is investigating the   , extent of the Sinn Fein organisation there and who reported    some time ago that the temper of the men was &quot;ugly&quot;&quot;, now say    that within the last few months it has become&apos;dangerous.  11!    Sinn Peiners claim that they have one full unit armed, but I    believes that the unit in question, which numbers nearly 600    possesses less than fifty rifles.  Many of them, however,    carry automatic pistols.   He thinks that if an outbreak on a    large scale were te occur in Ireland, or a  national strike    took place in this country, there would be outrages by the    Sinn Feiners.         The Gaelic League is said to have doubled its membershl    within the last twelve months and have eight schools in    London.        .  The Meeting planned for the Albert Hall on February 1    is likely to be attended  by a good many revolutionaries wit    the usual accompaniments  of &quot;The Red Flag&quot; and the &quot;Interns    There is a tendency on the  part  of these to identify themse    with Sinn  Fein,  and there is definite information  that the    Irish Republican Brotherhood,  which is the dangerous wing o                                                         Sinn/
     Sinn Fein,  is in correspondence with Bolshevik agents.   The     movement will therefore need careful watching.IEELAND          The campaign of organised outrages is being continued     by the extreme section  of Sinn Fein.   On Saturday night,     24th instant, an organised raid was made on the Police     Barracks at Baltinglase (Co. V/ieklow).   The attackers failed     to enter the barracks.   Two police  constables  were wounded0          These  attacks en barracks are  usually very much     exaggerated by the Press,  and Gn occasions when explosives     are used&apos; the damage reported is generally very much     over-estimated.          It is  reported from a reliable source that John     MeHeill,  at a Sinn Foin meeting, protested very strongly     against the recent murders of police officials.          The arrest  of sixty-five Sinn  Foin loaders during  the     recent raids must have  the effect of disorganising the     campaign of outrage for seme little time,  for  the men were     all influential  officers of the Volunteer Army arid organised     the outrages.  A good many of the important men escaped by     being away  from  home, it being the  habit of the loaders not     to sleep more than a night or two in the same  house.  1$     must be remembered that it is not so much approval of the     policy of murder that prevents witnesses from  coming forv/ard     as the complete  and effective system of terrorism which .     reigns in Ireland.   Every potential informant  knows  that     not only will he pay forfeit with his life for becoming en     informer, but that all  his relations, and even his     descendants,  will be branded.
