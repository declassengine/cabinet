2 CHANCELLOR:   Gentlemen, Mr Brand was good enough tosend me  on  January 16th a copy of the Memorial which hehad sent  the day &quot;before on your behalf to the Prime Minis-ter.   The Prime Minister was at that time in Paris; and Ihad had no  communication with him at the moment; but i thought  it  would be  useful, as a preliminary to a disous-sion  of  the Memorial signed by such very influential names,and  on so serious a  subject, if you would he good enoughto meet rne, or some  of you would be good enough to meet me,in  order  to give me  more precise information as to whatwas  in your minds.   I have asked my colleagues, Sir auckland geddes and  Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, to be with methis  afternoon.  We  should like to learn from you something-more  about  the Memorial.  I had intended, when I sent the invitation to  Mr Brand, that our meeting should be aprivate  one; I had no intention that the whole of the Pressshould have its attention concentrated  upon it; and  Ithink it is a  little unfortunate that  that  should have occurred.  It  has been  unavoidable.  I  do not think  anybody is  to blame; but  I  think  it  is  unfortunate, because  it gives rise to  expectations that there  is  some sudden and easy way to cure all the  evils  of  the  world, a delusionwhich you at any  rate I am  sure do not  share.   I have a gentleman here to  take  a  Shorthand Note of  our  conversa-tion,  not with a view to  its publication, but  in order  that what you may say may be  available  in  full for my colleagues,and not merely any  such report  as  those of  us who are present would  give  of what may  be  said.   I  think that probably at the end  of our Conference  we  had  better  just issue a simple note  to the Press  that  in  response  to an invitation issued  by me as  soon as  I received a  copy ofthe Memorial which  you had addressed  to the Prime Minister, I asked you to meet  me, and  that we had had an  interesting
   interchange of views   something of that kind.          Perhaps you will tell me in the first place what   is the genesis of this movement?  I think I have some idea:   hut I should liko to know as exactly as I can from you.   Obviously a movement which&apos;results in a Memorial signed by   the citizens of several countries and presented to their   Governments is a result of much previous conversation and   negotiation, and is not a sudden growth.  I should like you,   therefore, if you would, to tell me what was the origin of   the Memorial.  Then the second question I wish to put to   you is a very big and comprehensive one: it is in general   terms to say that I presume that people of your experience   did not sign a Memorial of this kind without having in   your own minds the outline at least of a policy which you   would recommend to us.  Assume that the British Government   were, as you suggest, to accept the invitation of another   Government to a Conference of this kind, the represents- .  tivea of the British Government must go there with some   ideas; and what I wanted to ask you was, what was in broad   outline the  scheme which you thought the British delegates   going to such a conference might either suggest or support,   if it came from other people.  The third main  question   that I wished to put to you was in regard to the differ-   ence between the American Memorial and  the Memorial pre-   sented to the Governments  of  other Countries.   Let me  turn   aside  for the moment to say that when Mr Brand sent me  a   copy of  the  Memorial, he told  me that the  signatories  to   the prench Memorial were so  few or unrepresentative, that   at present  that memorial was  not being presented.Mr BRAID):   I  will  tell  you about  that presently,17HB CHANCELLOR: You will tell me presently whether there  has   been any change in that.   As regards the  American Memorial,   they made  two  very important  changes in the  terms of what
was intended to be a Memorial presented in identical terms in all countries.   In tho first place,  though they presentedtheir memorial to1 Government, they presented it to Gov-ernment and certain private bodies; and their suggestion was not for a conference of representatives of the Govern-rnont,  or for a conference called by the Government; butthat a conference should be called or participated in feythe Chamber of Commerce of the United States,  In additionto that, they omitted certain words in your Memorial which appeared to have a pretty clear significance, and. probablywere omitted just because they had that signifioance, namelythose  words in which you said that &quot;the World&apos;s balance  ofindebtedness has been upset, and has become top-heavy andone-sided.  Is not it necessary to free the world&apos;s balance sheet  from some of the fictitious items which now inflateit and lead to fear or despair on the part of some, and  torecklessness on the part of others?  Would not a deflationof the world1s balance sheet be the first step towards acure?&quot;  Accordingly the American memorial differs from yoursin not asking for Government action in initiative or inrepresentation at the Conference; and in excluding thewords  which suggested that a solution might be found orin part found, by any romission of obligations alreadyincurred as between Government and Government.   I should bovery glad to hear in this connection what change if any the attitude of the Am american memorialists makes in yourattitude.  The significant feature about that change is,that it is notoriously made under, shall I say, pressure from the American Treasury; and since you presented yourMemorial a letter from Mr Secretary Glass has been pub-lished in the papers, (he has published it, I suppose),  inwhich he very clearly indicates that in his opinion loans
   from Government to Government ought to cease, that any   remission of debt is not a fit subject for a conference   of the kind suggested; and I think he indicates pretty   clearly that he does not think it is a matter for confer-   ence at all, that future assistance to trade must come from   private sources, and that the Government of the United   States is wholly opposed, to any further Government inter-   vent ion by subsidy,  credit or control. That is a very   important declaration; and it does, as it seems to me,   materially affect the proposal which you have laid before   us.  Other questions will arise as we discuss the matter   together; but those  are the three points I wanted to put   to you in the first  instance, namely (l) What was the   genesis of this international memorial;  (2) what had you   in mind as to the policy which you thought the Government   might pursue; and (3) how is that affected by the attitude   taken up by the American memorialists and the United States   Treasury?Mr BRAND:  Mr Chamberlain, I should like on behalf of the   Deputation, merely because I happen to be responsible for   collecting the signatures in this Country, and therefore,   I happen to know more, I think, about the origin of the   Memorial perhaps than most others who are present, just   briefly to . say that it originated from people who happen   to have been at Paris in some sort of capacity during the   Peace Conference representing different nations., There were   collected there financial representatives of all the   Neutrals as well as of the Belligerents, the Allies; and   after they left Paris most of them were still in touch in   some way or another. As the financial state of Europe grew &apos;   worse,  I think they felt that some steps more ought to be   taken;  and the initiative with regard to this movement came   from Holland, particularly from Dr Yissering, who is
Governor of the Bank  of  the Netherlands, and Mr.tor Meulen,who  is a partner of Hope &amp; Co., and who happened, to he theDutch representative  in Paris.  They invited from Sweden,Denmark, Switzerland, Norway and this Country,  certainpeople whom they had  got to know at Paris, representingin some financial capacity their Countries *  They alsoinvited from France a gentleman called K. lavey, who had notbeen present: the French had only official representatives in Paris; and they did  not invite any of the Treasurypeople from Paris,  They invited. M. Lave;/ fro; JI  Paris.  i&apos;heyalso invited, from America Mr. Kent, who was a temporarymember cf the Reparation Committee in Paris; and Mr.PaulWarberg, who was a distinguished American financier.  Cer-tain meetings were held at Amsterdam; and ultimately, after two  or three meetings, this Memorial was drafted in this manner, with the idea of getting responsible signatoriesin each country, and  presenting it first of all to theLeague of Nations, it was suggested.  Perhaps I mightexplain, although it  is not of much interest just now, thatthe American Government was the first&apos; to know what washappening;  because Mr.lent, I think: perhaps unwisely,unknown to the rest of the people concerned, thought it his duty to telephone it  to Washington before it was signed,or &quot;before it was determined, upon; and therefore, theAmerican Government knew long ago what was likely to becoming; and as a matter of fact at the time they issued, astatement rather of the character of this one recentlyissued.  llr.E!ent ultimately found that he could net sign it,as ho was an official; and it was left to Mr,V/arberg toobtain the signatures in the United States; and It was  ,decided, owing  to the political situation in America, tosend it to the different Governments and not to the
Secretary of the.League of nations,   As I think you have seen, a Very representative set of signatures was  obtained in every country with the exception of France.   In the caseof France,&apos;M. Lavey,  who was collecting signatures,  didcollect five other signatures.  I do not know any  of thempersonally,  I understand they are very representative,responsible men, but  at the same time, with the exceptionof one, who is the President of the Union of Bankers,  Ido not ihink they particularly represented the  financialcommunity;   and as I  was responsible for the publication ofthe signatures here,  I did not publish them in this Couri-try,  because I thought it would not add to the  strengthof the Memorial to have simply six French signatories.   I might also  state the  Memorial was not published in theFrench press, with the exception of very small extracts.That I understand was owing to the fact that the Governmentthen in being did not perhaps look with great favour upon it&apos;;  and a  restriction was added by the^ French signatories to the Memorial which I might read out.  &quot;It is understoodthat a reasonable delay shall be allowed to each Countryto reduce its current expenses to the level of its receiptsdrawn from taxation or other normal sources of revenue;and that the recommendations in lines 109 to 120 can onlybe applied  in each particular case as far as they arereconcilable with the stability, length of standing and credit of the State in question.&quot;  That is where it is pro-posed to take a first charge *m Customs duties or something like that.          I do not know whether I feel competent,  in thepresence of other bankers Of much greater experience thanmyself, to  state what the policy of the Memorial is;  butI am perfectly prepared to, if they wish it.  Perhaps I can
   state  what  wo  in Amsterdam when we met had  in view.  VJe had   first  of  all in view that if matters went on in Europe as   they are  doing now,  with paper currency  being issued at   tho  pace  it is now,  ultimately there must bo&apos; a collapse;   it would  ultimately  make all banking credit absolutely  , impossible, and would  drain away  all the resources   of the countries  concerned,  therefore,  we  deliberately   framed the  Memorial  in such a way as not to put the   question  of credit first;  but to put first the question   of  internal reform in each country;  that  is to say, the   absolute  necessity of each country balancing its  budget,   and  of ceasing to put out paper  currency.   If you look   onwards from  line  67 on tho  second page, you will see that   a condition of granting credit was,  that they had made   their  budgets  balance; and a farther condition was,  that  tho   burden of indebtedness between  the differout Countries   should also be brought within  some reasonable and. possible   limits.  Perhaps  the first was  the greatest point of all,   on which the  Memorialists  intended  to  lay stress.TEE CiiAHCELLOS:  The  first point,  then,  would  be, that no   credit should be  granted until somebody representing those   who might grant credits was  satisfied that the  internal   financial arrangements of  tho  borrowing country had been   put on a satisfactory basis.Mr BEAIS: Yes.THE. CHANCELLOR:  Yon would have a kind of international com-   mittee of control for the finance of the country ?Mr BRAND: We said nothing about machinery.  If wo had put   forward anything in de+jil,  it would have  been simply a   question of criticism.  Our great object was to put forward   certain very  broad principles which wo  thought right; and   to  got together a conference to  consider tho matter on   those  grounds, and  consider further questions of maohineiy.
   BUT CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE MAIN PRINCIPLE OF ALL,THE CHANCELLOR:  ASSUME THAT THAT FIRST STEP WERE TAKEN IN   SOME WAY OR ANOTHER, THAT YOU HAD&apos; THE MACHINERY AND THAT   YOU WERE SATISFIED THAT COUNTRIES A, 3 AND. C HAD PUT THEIR   HOUSE IN ORDER, ACCORDING1 TO SUCH STIPULATIONS AS YOU   MIGHT THINK REASONABLE, THEN ON CAUSE BEING SHEWN, YOU   WOULD SAY THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR CREDITS.MR BRAND: YES.1TIF. CHANCELLOR:  FROM WHOM DID YOU EXPECT THEM TO GET THE   CREDITS?IR BRAND: OUR IDEA, I THINK, WAS CERTAINLY NOT THE IDEA WHICH   APPEARS TO BE THAT OF THE UNITED STATES&apos; TREASURY, NAMELY,   THAT ALL THE  MONEY SHOULD COME FROM THE UNITED STATES. THEY   SAY THEY CANNOT FINANCE THE WHOLE WORLD. THAT WAS NEVER   THE INTENTION. THE IDEA WAS, THAT THERE WOULD BE CERTAIN   COUNTRIES WITH EXPORTS WHICH THEY WISH TO GET RID. OF, AND   OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WERE DYING BECAUSE THEY COULD, NOT GET   THOSE PARTICULAR EXPORTS: AND THE GENERAL IDEA WAS THAT   THE COUNTRIES WITH EXPORTS TO SELL WOULD ARRANGE CREDITS   FOR THE NECESSITOUS COUNTRIES THAT MUST HAVE THOSE EXPORTS.   WE STATED THAT THE PROBLEM WE THOUGHT WAS BEYOND THE ,   POSSIBILITY OF ORDINARY BANKING CREDIT; AND THAT, THEREFORE,   CREDIT IN SOME FORM OR OTHER WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE TO COME   FROM THE GOVERNMENTS.THE CHANCELLOR:  YES; AND, THEREFORE, WHAT YOU CONTEMPLATED WAS,   THAT THE COUNTRIES WITH PRODUCTS TO SELL WOULD, THROUGH   THEIR GOVERNMENTS, GIVE CREDITS TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE   COUNTRIES WHICH HAD POUT THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER, AND HAD   NEED OF THESE PRODUCTS.MR BRAND: YES; GOVERNMENT CREDIT SO FAR AS THERE WERE NO   OTHER RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT THAT MOMENT.THE CHANCELLOR:  DID YOU CONTEMPLATE THAT EACH COUNTRY SO   SUPPLYING CREDIT WOULD PROVIDE A CREDIT FOR THE PURCHASE
  of its own commodities;  or did you contemplate that all  these -----Mr BRAND:  No-one who knows the United States would think that  they would give credit for anybody else&apos;s exports oxcept  their own; and certainly I think we contemplated as regards  the British Empire that the United Kingdom alone could not  possibly do it, but that the British Dominions would natur-  ally, haying their own exports to sell, have to be partners  in the scheme, I may state that when I was in Amsterdam a  few days ago. Dr Vissering told me that Holland was ready  to make  a loan of, I think he said 200,000,COO guilders to  Germany, fresh money, not repayment of obligations, but  they did not see their way to do it for two reasons; one  was the  Reparation Commission,. The other reason was , that  they thought some loan or other would, have to be made to  Germany by the United States or somebody before long; and  that if they .raade one now. America would come along say  and take a first mortgage on tho Customs duties. They  thought if they loaned now there would be a second mortgage,  and. they were not prepared, to do it-. They were prepared to  come in on some co-operative scheme, but not  alone.THE CHANCELLOR: With an unrestricted credit? I  do.not mean  unrestricted as to amount, but as to application?Mr BRAND:  I imagine they would leave it to the  German Govern-                                 i  ment, if it were made to Germany.THE CHANCELLOR: You said as regards America, that if the  American Government were prepared to grant any  credit,  no-one who knows America would anticipate that  it would  give credit  for anything but the purchase of  American  produc e?Mr BRAND: Yes,THE CHASCiSLIOR: I understood you to say  also, that you
   thought it not reasonable that the British Empire should   grant a credit for produce other than produce of the   British Empire *  What about the Dutch credit!Mr BRAND: I should imagine for the produce of the Dutch   Colonies,  but I did not ask them.THE CHANCELLOR: Each country for its own produce ?Mr BRAND: Yes.THE CHANCELLOR: At the disposal of Germany for whatever the   Country might need for its world needs, without respect to   where it might be drawn.Mr BRAND: I think each for its own produoe.  Then the last   point was about the American loans. Of course that, as   you said,  was due, as everybody knows, to the pressure of   the American Treasury,, Our view is, that notwithstanding   that change, we should still urge on the British Govern-   meat to hold a conference called by the Governments, not   necessarily entirely of Government officials, that would   be a matter entirely for them, but a conference called by   the Governments, without the United States Government, if   they did not wish to take $art,.but with such represents-   tives as might be appointed from a Chamber of Commerce,   if they liked to come*THE CHANCELLOR::Your proposal was a proposal for Government   loans?                   AMr BRAND: I do not think we very definitely said Government   loans.THE CHANCELLOR: You remember just now you called my attention   to the words in the Memorial which stated that the problem   exceeds the capacity of ordinary banking credits; and you   explained that that meant -----Mr BRAND: We said a more comprehensive scheme is necessary0   There are not many other alternatives to Government credit.   It is perfectly true other means might possibly be found
   besides ordinary banking credit;  but  I  imagine  a  conference   meeting would find the money required was  on such a  scale   that only some Government assistance  would be sufficient.TE3 CMIICSLLOR:  Let me get your proposal  perfectly  clearly?   You have a clear indication from the  American Treasury   that the American Government will not participate in a   conference called on the lines of your  Manorial,Mr BKAJCD:  Yes.TIG C1IAEOBLLOR:  You ask the British Government to call suoh   a Conference in spite of that, and to invite to it private   citizens of Amerioa, or invite the American Chamber  of   Commerce to name delegates, and to proceed with the  Con-   conferenee in the absence of the American  Government.   In the   second place, you admitted clearly as a possibility, and   even as a probability, that for the success  of your scheme,   credits must be given by Government to  Government; and   that private resources will be insufficient. Do  you con-   template, with the American Government  refusing any  such   credit, that we should give it?Mr BRAND:  I think we  contemplate in a sort of way going  on   without the United  States altogether.  We  contemplate  if   the United States vail not come in, that it would still   be worth while, particularly for this question of internal   reforms in these different countries, that a Government   Conference of European States, of British Dominions  and of   South American States, if they will come in, should be   held, called either by the British Government,  or perhaps   preferably initiated by a Neutral; and that if the Govern-   inerits thought it desirable, they should invite also any   representatives from the American Chamber of Commerce who   liked to  come.  If  the Governments thought  it undesirable   that those representatives should be there, then we oontem-   plate that  the Conference  should proceed without  them.   altogether.
THE CHANCELLOR:  Quite frankly,  X  no.  not  see  how such a  scheme   can succeed without the co-operation  of the  American   Government,   She is the possessor of a great part of  the   supplies of which the  distressed  countries stand in  need.   She is the creditor of all  the Belligerents,  at  any  rate   of all the Allies.,  She has  indicated quite  clearly  that   she is not prepared to give  any further Government aaaist-   ance,  except of a limited kind in relief of  distress,  or   possibly,  on cause shewn,  by postponement of her interest   claims on debt from the Allied Governments in Europe,  She   has indicated further  that international bond, issues,   international guarantees,  international measures for the   stabilisation of the exchange, are utterly impracticable   as long as there exist inequalities of taxation  and   domestic financial policy in the  various countries   involvedj  and that when those inequalities no longer exist,   such devices will in their opinion be unnecessary.   They   further stated and this is very pertinent to your pro-   posal that we should go on without their co-operation   that they are entirely opposed to any postponement of their   claim to repayment of their debt, and to any new obliga-   tion that may be created,  Now, you cannot have  a clearer   indication from the American  Treasury that they  are  not   with you in the policy which you are advocating. If we go   into a Conference of thisrkind, one of two things will   happen, with America standing out: Either it comes to   nothing; or that  the whole burden will fall upon us. Do you   think we can bear it?Mr BRAND: No, we could not bear  the whole of it, any more than   the United States could.THE CHANCELLOR: With tha United  States standing out, is it not   true  that  the whole burden will &quot;fall upon us,Mr BRAND:  I  suppose the burden  would fall  on  the British                               13,
    Empire,  so  far as  the  exports  came  from  them; and, of    course,  on  the Neutrals,  too;  &quot;but  naturally no Conference    would, finance  exports  from the United  States. THE CHANCELLOR:   Which is what we are  asked to do* Sir DONALD  MACLEAN:   Is the  American decision absolutely final    in its present aspect? Mr B3AHB:   I  think the point about  international guarantees    will affect our scheme.   I think they  have there  in mind   some scheme  like Sir George PaishTs, which I think is   absolutely  impracticable,  where you  amalgamate  the credits   of different countries. Each country would have  to raise   its own money on its 07m  credit,  of  course.THE CHANCELLOR:  That  is the  vital point of the co-operation   which you seek.  If we  were ready and. in  a position to give   credit, we  could do it, of course, without any such co-   operation.   Ve could ourselves, if we thought fit, say:  A   condition of relief to  Austria is that  Austria, does this,   that or  the other;   and still more so in&apos; regard  to other   Countries,Mr BRAND:  Of course,  I gave  a point of the  Dutch position.,   Without  international co-operation they will not lend  the   money, because they say they do not  know what is going to   happen.THE CHANCELLOR:  The Dutch point, as you have put  it, was in   the first place that they were afraid America would come   in and take a mortgage in front of them, which  seems to me   improbable;   and in  the second place that they  wanted  to   know what was the result of  the Reparation Commission,   before they decided whether  to advance  or not.   Well  this    conference cannot anticipate  the work of the  Reparation .   Commission.Sir AUCKLAND GIDDES:  Might I ask this.  It really is an all-    round scheme of export credits,   is  it not?  That  is what it   amounts  to, as  I understand  it?   There  is nothing  else in   it?  Each coma try provides credits  for its own exports?
 Mr BRAND:  In the  export  credit  scheme yo&amp; have a committee    I happen to  be on it,  to  deal  with the particular instances.     1 the  &quot;big Western Countries,  I  do net believe you could    deal with it like that. You  would have to hand over a lump    sum to  the&apos; German Government to  be spent  in the way they    thought best. Sir AUCKLAND GEDDES: In  the  same  way as  we had the Belgian    Reparation credit here, they would have a credit  in this    country, and tfuy goods against it. You mean an all-round    scheme  of that sort?Mr BRAND: Yes.                                        -THE CHANCELLOR: In the Belgian case  they were limited to buy-    ing certain classes of goods which were the product of  the    British Empire. The orig-finally stipulation  was  , that we  were    to be satisfied that  everything was  British Empire product,    in order to protect our exchange. We waived  that  for prac-    tioal reasons in its  application a  little,  and altered  the    form; but substantially it was to be confined to  goods  of    British ^origin. But that sets  free  any resources  which    Belgium had in the London market to  buy dollars  over                                                         *    London, Mr BRAND:  Yes. THE CHANCELLOR: Which is exactly what happened,  I do not  know    who  observed the  other day very wisely,  that the Dollar    Sterling Exchange was not&quot;a New York London Exchange,  it was    a New  York European Exchange. Suppose such a scheme,as you     sketched  really  could be  carried through, Suppose Holland    gave a credit for the purchase - of Dutch products, and we of    British products,  or  the  British Empire of British products,     and  the United  States of  American products, and so on     through  South America and elsewhere, do you anticipate     any  great effects on  the  exchanges?  Mr BRAND: I  think  our main  object  was not so much the
   exchanges,  as to gat Europe going,  in order to prevent  - these countries absolutely collapsing.   I think there  would   be a great effect On the European Countries,  in getting   imports which they must have.  What the immediate effect on   the exchange would be,  I could not tell.  The amount is   so enormous that I suppose even so, the exchange would   not be very much appreciated.THE CHANCELLOR:  Our exchange would be injured.  You have been   good enough, Mr.Brand,  to answer my questions on behalf   of the Deputation.  I do not know whether any of the other   Members would like to add anything to what you have   said?Mr BRAND:  I think they would. I think that what we wanted &apos;   was an informal discussion of the whole situation.THE CHANCELLOR:  That is entirely my view; and,  there-   fore, I do not want to keep It a duologue  between   you and me.  What is your  feeling, Mr, McEenna?
III. MOKEHNA:  I THINK IT MAST DEPEND TO A CERTAIN EXTANT UPON    THE VIEW THAT ONE TAKES OF THO DANGER OF THE SITUATION- AS    IT STANDS NOW.  IF YOU THINK THAT EUROPE WILL MUDDLE    THROUGH SOMEHOW AND. THAT WE ARE NOT ON THE POINT OF    COLLAPSE IN EUROPE, THEN I DO NOT KNOW THAT THIS SCHEME OR    ANY SCHEME IS NECESSARY: HUT IF YOU DO TAKE A SERIOUS VIEW,    THAT IF POLAND, AUSTRIA, AND EVEN PRANCE,  ARE LEFT TO GO    ON AS THEY ARE GOING NOW, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE a &quot;BREAKDOWN    OF ALL CREDIT AND OF ALL EXCHANGES, IT DOES MAKE ONE CON-    SIDER WHETHER SOMETHING SHOULD NOT BE DONE, AT ANY RATE    IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, TO GET THO GOVERNMENTS OF THOSE    COUNTRIES TO REALISE HOW THEY STAND AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING.    YOU CANNOT APPEAL TO THE government IN ANY FORM WHATEVER    UNLESS YOU HAVE AT THE END OF YOUR APPEAL SOME PROSPECT OF    ASSISTANCE.  IN THESE PROPOSALS HERE THE ASSISTANCE IS    ONLY CONTEMPLATED ON CERTAIN CONDITIONS,,  THE ONLY RECOM-   - MENDATION MADE IS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A CONFERENCE AND    THAT AT THAT CONFERENCE POSSIBLY IT WILL BE BROUGHT HOME    FOR THE FIRST TIME TO SOME OF THE GOVERNMENTS THAT IF THEY    GO ON SPENDING FIVE OR SIX TIMES THEIR INCOME, THERE CAN    ONLY BE ONE END TO IT: IT CAN ONLY END IN BOLSHEVISM    IN THE COUNTRY.  YOU CAN BRING HOME TO THEM THAT IF THEY    CAN BRING THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS, WHICH ARE NOT GOVERNED    BY EXCHANGE, BECAUSE THEY ARE PAYING THEIR WAY IN THEIR OWN    CURRENCY, INTO ORDER AND DO NOT BORROW ANY MORE, THEN    AT, ANY RATE THEIR EXCHANGES WILL NOT FALL ANY FURTHER; AND    WHAT WAS a VERY BAD BANKING PROPOSAL, TO LEND THEM MONEY    AND ASSISTANCE IN THEIR TRADE, BECOMES QUITE a GOOD ONE.    WHEN THIS IS POINTED OUT TO THEM AND YOU PERSUADE THEM BY    THIS MEANS TO GET THEIR COUNTRY INTO ORDER, AND IT IS THE    ONLY CHANCE, I THINK, YOU HAVE OF  DOING IT, THERE IS A    PROSPECT OF THAT, WITH COMPARATIVELY LITTLE MONEY, YOU WOULD    BE ABLE TO SET THEM GOING AGAIN, BECAUSE WE ARE STILL
prooeeding now upon tho basis of trado conditions as theywere before the war.  We have still International Exohangeand trading is still being carried on in the same way by private credits, Just, as was done before.  We cannot,however, go on doing it and immediately In front of usthere is a prospect of a complete breakdown, ouch a break-down as you have had in Russia where for a very long timeyou have been able to buy no exchange at all,  The time will come when you will be able to buy no French Exchange .You can still buy. French Exchange because the French havea certain amount of securities to sell, South African andother stock3 with which they flooded our Market and used the Sterling they obtained to buy Dollars with-  Bat thatoannot go on, and when that ceases you will get a breakdown of all Exchange and all trade and the collapse of EuropeaThat is not an American problem but a British problem, ifit is true, as I see the facts,  Well, if that is aBritish problem, whether America comes in or not, I think we have even in our own interests to do our best te re-start Europec  Personally, I do not believe it is aquestion of immense credits and I do not read thisMemorial as contemplating anything of  the sorto  It saysin this passage:  ,the signatories submit that while muchcan be done through normal Banking channels, the working capital needed is too large an amount and is required tooquickly for such channels to be adequate0,T   I nevercontemplated any real huge European loan upon this basis018.i
    If you get 200,000,000 Guilders from Holland, 17 Million    sterling, if you get something from Scandinavia, something    from Switzerland and something from us, we shall together    he able to restart European trade;  hut if you do nothing,    if you leave things as they are, then a collapse is    inevitable. I admit  the force of all the arguments to be    used against this, but they are all arguments based upon    pre-war considerations of trade and not based, as I see it,    upon the actual financial and economic situation in Europe    to-day;   and I would therefore recommend, as one  of the    signatories, that the recommendation of the Memorial    be accepted by the Government.THE CHANCELLOR:   I should have no difficulty in encouraging    what I may call an educational Conference,  a Conference    which would be composed of non-Government representatives,    such a Conference, as the United States representatives    would take part in - I mean representatives of America    bodies though not of the American Government. Of course    the Supreme  Economic Council has been pointing out the    dangers  of the situation and drawing the moral which yon    speak of,  Mr McKenna,  at all its Meetings for many months    past,  as nobody knows better than Lord Roberto  what I am    afraid of is a Conference of Governments with America out    and everybody coming to know what we will do and leaning    upon us.  The French want to borrow from us, the Belgians    want to  borrow from us, and the Poles want  to borrow from&apos;    us.  In pre-war times they did not come to borrow from a    Government,  they could borrow in the Market if they liked,    and wo could lend to them,  but they now all want a Govern-    ment credit.   If we get a Conference of this kind of    Government representatives, it is only too  likely that it    may result in a combined demonstration from all these Powers
   that it is our duty to  lend,LORD ROBERT CECIL :   Just a word  in  answer  to  that,  since  this   is a very informal discussion.   I  think I  know the kind   of thing that does happen in  these cases0   On  the other   hand I think there would &quot;be some advantage,,  even from  that   point of view, in getting them, altogether,  I  had the   great honour of a conversation with the Roumanian Prime   Minister on Sunday.  He wanted money.   I ventured to say   to him that it was impossible to deal with any one Country   and that the only thing is to have a general conspectus of   the wants of Europe and then  they will  see that their   systems which consist of doing nothing  in their own   Countries at all to meet the  situation, but merely asking   somebody, the Germans,  the Americans,  or the English,  to   provide money for them, is quite impracticable^  The   moment you came to state it as a joint  proposition  of   Europe, everybody would see it was quite impracticable;  the   sums would be prodigious0  I think even that would be  an   advantage.   I look at it,  I need not say, not from the   financial point of view but from the political point of   view..   I think the whole of Europe is under a most curious   delusiona  They are all mad in my judgment.  They are   going  on  doing things which are leading them straight to   disaster  without  having apparently the  slightest idea   that  they are going to disaster,,  I was told yesterday,   you knew  whethar  or not. it is true, that  at present Poland   is  spending  ei?ht times its revenue annually6   It is  quite   evident that is absolutely insane^  Almost any political   change would  be better  than&apos;  that.  The  other Countries&apos;   are  all doing more  or less  the same kind of thing0  I   will  say  a word about what you  said in  a  moment, but  to
  my mind the chief value of this Conference  would  be  educational.  As I understand,  you do not object  to  educa-  tion but you are afraid of the  Governments  going  ina  But,  if yon keep the Governments out,  I do not think the  educa-  tloual value of the Conference  would be  very great.   I  speak with the greatest respect,  but in  my view merely a  few as it were casual or uninfluential representatives  meeting together in this Country and making recommendations  would not carry very ouch weighto  They  would not really  wake up the Country.  It is a political  and psychological  problem, as I see it, almost as mu^h as a financial  problem,  and you have to bring home to these people  the frightful  danger that Europe is really in,  economically, at this  minute *THE CH^CEIIOS:  Let ne say about that that I do not  at all  under-rate the danger in which  Europe stands0  To have  the machine stopped in half Europe is disastrous  to  us and  to everybody from the trading point of view just  as  much as  from the political point of view, and I  am a little  afraid,  things being so bad, that we may be unable to save  these  people but nay be dragged down  in the effort; and I am  very much afraid of encouraging them in  the belief  that  they can be saved by anybody else!s efforts but their own*  How, you have mentioned Roumanian  -Vhat  is the position  in Roumania?  I saw a report the other day that the  Roumanian peasants having got the land,  and having  worked all their lives for  somebody else, are now not  going to work for anybody and they are cultivating only  enough land for their own wants, with tho result that  Roumania, which ought to be  an exporting Country and have  a large export which would  give  it a  credit, is likely to  be  starving.
Mr J.H. THOMAS: . That Is the one  fatal answer,,  if  you will   allow me to say so,  to an Informal  Conference.   If you   get any informal Conference  there will  be  a  suspicion in   the minds of the working classes that it is  merely a game   of the Bankers to get over their own difficulty,, and will   not solve the problem.  I speak very; frankly because I   believe that the difficulty  we experience  to-day In dealing .  with the European situation  is a difficulty  that is at   home.  The working classes in  this  Country to-day do   not distinguish between mere paper  money and wealth; and   the result is that they do not understand  how difficult   the situation iSc  They do not understand  where it will   lead to, they do not understand that they  will  be the first   to suffer; and the result is that I think  from  that   standpoint the information-on  the world-s  position would   bo not only an advantage to  the Countries  that  we have   mentioned,- but it would be an  advantage to our  own Country   to bring home tho danger to  us at home. - That  could  only   be done, in my judgment, by a  proper representative   Government Conference as distinct from an informal   Conference, because I do not think it  would carry the ,  weight and responsibility and give  the  confidence that  a   Government Conference would.  On the other hand, I quite   see  the force of America being left out,  but I do not  think   that would affect the  situation in the least,  because   you would come back to this proposition, that everyone   would  realise that  there  was  much more of selfishness   in the action of America  than anything else..   I think   that would  be the view the  masses ^ould take of it.  The(   worst  thing that  could happen,  I think, would  be an   informal Conference.   In my opinion it would do more harm   than good.   If  you are going  to  have a Conference let it
   be a Goveirnmont Conference,  otherwise it would  create  such   a suspicion in the minds of the workers that it would  do   far more harm than good.Sir R,M0KBlDISRSLSI:  From -my point of view, from the very   first when this question was introduced originally,  the   chief answer which X saw in it was that it would   enable the nations as a whole, even without America,  who   at that time, of course, was imagined to he, amongst  them,   to get together and to lay down a set of rules, so to   speak, to which nations had to conform before they got   credit from other nations.  That is merely emphasising   what Mr Thomas has just now said, that, if it is a Confer-   ence  of Governments and thsy lay down certain definite   rules to which Countries, broadly, hav9 to conform,  it must   demand the attention  of the world as&apos;a whole.  There would   be no dictation to them beyond this, but you would simply   say  to them: &quot;If you  want credit you have to do this.  We   do not ask you to  come  for  credit, but  you  cannot get   credit without it&quot;,THE  CHANCELLOR:   No,  but yOu would  imply  that  if  thoy do   this  they would get credit.-Sir  R.M.KIEDEKSLEI:   They will get  credit  to the  extent, that   Europe is able to  give  it them,  I do  not grant  them any   amount.   I  think  Sir Auckland Geddes  and you  have felt   very strongly  that it would put  a  reckless  burden upon the   Exchange of  this Country.   There again,  it  would depend   on the length  to which we went,  but  it  seems to me it  would   alao  oe on  one hand a considerable relief.  You  have   to-^lay tho. neutral Countries  of the  world all,  I  believe,   ready under  given  circumstances to give  credit,  but with-&apos;   holding that credit.    Holland,  I  believe South America,
   and others, would  be  prepared  to  do  so,  but they are not   prepared at this moment  to  give credit to  these devastated   Countries because  they see  the people are  going to   perdition by  not conforming to the  ordinary economic   rules.   They  are not  giving credits  and  making exports   to this  Country.   What  I  believe is happening is that   we are taking a great deal  of  their  goods  and re-selling   them again to a limited  extent to some of  these Countries   ourselves and the  burden of that  exchange, in consequence,   falls upon this Country.    If  you could  get, say, Holland   to give  20 Millions  and  South  America to give 10 Millions,   and so on, I  believe  it  would  be  a  distinct relief  to this   Country, because you  would  get those goods exported from   those neutral Countries  direct to the weaker Countries,   and, to  that  extent,  it  would  be  a  relief  to our Exchanges.   The tendency  is for  everything to come through this Country   at the present moment and  for  us  to  bear the burden.   America  wants us to  take her goods,  re-sell to the  rest of   the world, and bear  the  burden.   If you  get, even with   the neutrals  in and America out,  direct  credit to the   devastated or derelict  Countries, it must  be a relief  on   your Exchanges to  that  extent, it seems  to me.   I do  not   feel that it  is going to be the  great  burden which  you   have in  mind.  I  believe it is absolutely  going  to  be  a   relief.    We  have  been the Bankers  of  the  world  and,  because   we have  relations  in every single foreign  Country  in an   intimate degree which no other Country in  the  world has,   the tendency  to-day is  to  push-it all  on to  us  because we   understand how to  do  it.  I believe that by  direct  loans   from the Allies that  would be  largely  overcome  and  help&apos;U8   in the  long run.Mr GBEIEE1I:   If I  might  add anything to the discussion,  it
   WOULD &quot;BE IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT  THE REASON  FOR   THE CHANGE IN AMERICA.   THAT AROSE,  AS I  UNDERSTAND,  FROM   THE FACT THAT ON THE FIRST DAY WHEN MR KENT  APPARENTLY   CABLED OVER THESE PARTICULARS, THE TREASURY  AT WASHINGTON   TOOK OBJECTION TO THEM AND EVENTUALLY THE  MEMORANDUM  WAS   PROCEEDED WITH IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE TREASURY DID   NOT WISH TO RECEIVE IT.   THEN EVENTUALLY  A  COMPROMISE WAS   DISCOVERED BY WHICH THE WASHINGTON TREASURY  WOULD NET   APPEAR, BUT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SHOULD TAKE ITS PLACE,THE CHANCELLOR:   I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD IF  YOU HAD CON-   FORMED THE ENGLISH MEMORIAL TO THE AMERICAN  MEMORIAL,MR GRENFELL:   THE REASON WAS THAT THE CLAUSE,  WHICH   WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE AMERICANS AS REGARDS  DEFLATION OF   THE WORLD RS BALANCE SHEET TO MEAN THAT THE OBLIGATIONS   WHICH AMERICA HAD FROM ENGLAND AND FRANCO  WERE TO BE  GIVEN   UP AND IN RETURN THE OBLIGATIONS OF POLAND AND EVERY  OTHER   COUNTRY SUBSTITUTED, WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY FROM THE POLITI-   CAL POINT OF VIEW WITH THE PRESENT AGITATION GOING ON AT   WASHINGTON.   SOBODY COULD HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD EITHER   THAT OR THE OTHER PROPOSITION, NAMELY, THAT  WE WERE ALL TO BE   RELEASED FROM OUR OBLIGATIONS TO AMERICA.    IT WOULD  BE   IMPOSSIBLE, I FEEL SURE, FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO PASS   THAT AND, THEREFORE, THIS COMPROMISE WAS SUGGESTED AND   THEN SIGNED by OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAD REFUSED  TO SIGN IT IN   ITS ORIVGINAL STATE.   THAT WAS SUCCEEDED BY  MR GLASS IS   LETTER WHICH, IN MY OPINION, THOUGH BRUTAL AND SELFISH, HAS   ADMINISTERED A VERY GOOD DOSE OF EDUCATION TO THE REST OF   THE WORLD.THE CHANCELLOR:   &quot;JOULD NOT THE BEST THING FOR  THE WORLD BO   THAT THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD ADDRESS TO  THE SIGNATORIES   OF THIS MEMORIAL A LETTER MUTATIS MUTANDIS IN SIMILAR TERMS   SAYINA MR GLASS&apos;S TALK IS UNCOMMON GOOD SENSE AND WE  TELL   YOU THE SAME THING?                         85.
M-Vo JpHo THOMAS:  But we do not propose to practise itoTHE 0HM03LL0R:  Why not?Mr0JoEo THOMAS:  Y/only it DO followed, on &quot;by saying we will   practise it rather than not propose to practise it?THE CHANCELLOR: Certainly we are proposing to practise it   We are proposing to make our Budget balance, we are propos-   ing to pay our way; we are proposing to take no fresh loans;   and we are not proposing to grant loans from Government   to Government.Mr MeXENNA:  Will you get Poland, Prance and Italy to promise   it too?Mr J.I.THOMAS:  Our Memorial is for a Conference of all and   it is no use having a statement from one.THE CHANCELLOR:   The only Countries which have given substan-   tial credits so far have been linerica and ourselves.   If   we say, like the Americans;   The time has come  to put a   stop to it, we have done with it, you must  now  look to the   ordinary channels, we shall re-enforce the  lesson which Mr   Glass has taught, which, as Mr. Grenfell  observes,  is  a very   useful  lesson.  If we call a  Conference we  hold out the .   hope that we shall take different action  from Mr  Glass,   that we shall  continue  to give credit while we  shall not   ourselves continue to borrow; and the question  is whether   we can  do that.Mr McKEMA:  I -was quite aware  of  that  point,  and  I  think   it would be a  good thing  to  make such an  announcement.  I   submit  it is perhaps more difficult  for England to  suddenly   stop lending  than  it has been for America.   I  think we   want that education.carried  through  in England,  and  at  a   Conference  it  might be  easier to take  the  lead  and  for   England to  say:  &quot;Now this is  going  to be  our Policy&quot;.  It   might be  easier  to do it at  a Conference  than  in  Mr Glass1s   language.
. THE CHANCELLOR:   You see,  I am sure,  quite  clearly,  that   England cannot live by borrowing.    If it is  to  buy   American food to supply foreign countries,  it has  to borrow   in America.   That is1the worst thing that  we can  do.    If it is to buy British goods to  lend to foreign  Countries   it has to borrow in this Country.    Yvhere am  I going to  get   the money, Mr. McKenna?  I may raise taxation to balance   our own expenditure, which is already a sufficiently   difficult task, but I cannot raise taxation in order to   have money to lend on rather doubtful security to  these   foreign Countries.  &apos;I must borrow money.   Can I  get  it?Mr McKenna:  I do not think the amounts involved would be so   alarming, but it would be a very serious  problem for you.THE CHANCELLOR:  Call it 50 Millions.Mr McKENNA:  I do not think this Country would be called  upon   for anything like that sum.   If once these Countries  get   started on a rational basis and are paying their way,  there   will be the ordinary trade advances made.   Of course  it   will affect the Exchange I quite admit, but it will not   affect the Government finance.   It will only be for the   assistance of  the trade advances by the Government.    I   should not contemplate any sum being advanced by this   Government of  50 Millions, or anything like it.THE CHANCELLOR:   What have you got in mind?Mr McKENNA:  I should think the sum of SO Millions at the   outside,  if as much.   Possibly it would only take the  form   of  a guarantee.Sir AUCKLAND GEDBES:   Scattered about  over  the Countries in   Europe.Mr McKENNA:  The  guarantee to  the various trading  firms who   would  advance  the money.    It would be perfectly rational    business  to advance money  to Poland at the present time,
   or to Austria,  or to Germany even,  if you could be  sure   that the Governments of those Countries were  going  to   conduct their affairs in a rational way;  hut  it is  very   had business to-day because you are advancing on a  currency   which you know at some time is going to be absolutely-   worthless if they go on as they are now.   The  moment the   currency is not getting worse it is quite good business   to trade with these people.  If your Educational Confer-   ence can be brought to the point of bringing  an influence   to bear upon those Countries it will he a step in the right   direction, because there is no way Of influencing them   except together, jointly, and, as Lord Robert has said,   stating the problem as a whole to them, and giving them the   prospect of a way out of their difficulties.   If the   figure represented a very large sum of course I admit you   cannot do it; you cannot go on borrowing any more.   They   cannot go on borrowing;THE CHANCELLOR:   Sir Charles, you have said nothing.Sir CHARLES ALDlS:  I do not feel quite that justice has been   done to the United States in Mr Glass1 -s reply.  You made   reference to his objection to International Bonds,  It seemed   to me, as I read it, they were International Bonds for a   specific purpose, namely, the rectification of the Exchanges   and, as that phrase  Is generally understood,  nothing I take it   would be farther from the purpose  the  signatories had in   view in putting forward  the Memorial.  We are agreed as   to the Imminence of  the  emergency  in  Europe.  To do nothing   would be inviting a  crisis.  The aim  of  this Memorial,   as I understand it,  is not  to supersede  the  private effort   by Government  International Bonds  but  only after the normal   sources have been exhausted  to then come  back, as a line  of   second defence,  or  as a  last resort, upon the  Government
for something in the nature of a guarantee when the  normal channels of credit referred to in the Memorial have  &quot;been exhausted.  Now, it seems to me they are not exhausted yet.There&apos; is a great deal of business being done in thiscountry by means of credits, it is being manufactured at what I think is a dangerous rate, and it seems to me itwould be a great advantage if a Conference could be  called in which, I take it, one of the first steps would be toappoint a Committee which would report upon the whole situation; which would have a deciding voice in the  extentto which the credit should be granted to the different countries of Central Europe and as to the class of comrao-commodities.  I suppose that only commodities would be supplied to effect the restarting of the European industrial machine.I take it the financial aid of the Government would not berequired at all or would in any case only be required as a last resort, and would, of course, be subject to the entirefreedom of the  Government to decide upon the merits of eachrecommendation  as it came from the Committee appointed bythe&quot; Conference.  I  feel also, as  I think my colleagues will agree,  that it would raise a very unfortunate  situa-tion if this Memorial, having been put forward and  havingbeen discussed, I agree unfortunately in  the public Pross,were now  to  be  abandoned apparently merely  because  theUnited  States  had chosen to  show  their  disapproval  of  it.I  think,  Sir,  that  would have  a very unfortunate effectnot only  in  this Country but  in Europe,   Now  I come  towhat  seems to  me  the  crux  of  the  whole  situation, and  thereal  difficulty.   I quite  agree  that  the  granting of what I  call  credit  through the  normal  channels is  dependent upon the security,  and  there  is  no  question that the  Memorialmakes  it quite clear  that  the only  adequate security which
   could bo provided by Europe would  bo  to  allow tho  credit   afforded to rank before the Indemnity and Reparation   Committee,  but to what extent  it.would be possible to   get Government agreement upon  that point I  am not  competent   to offer an opinion.LORD ROBERT CECIL:   It is provided for  in  the Treaty.Sir CILffiLES ADDIS:  That it may be deferred to prior.   claims.LORD ROBERT CECIL:  Yes, to things essential for raw   materials.Sir CHARLES ADDIS:.  If Government agreement could  be  got   upon that pcSnt I venture to think that  the ordinaryf                                         &apos;   resources of credit are by no  means exhausted and  that they   would go a long way, if joined in  a co-operative movement   of the neutral Powers and ourselves,  to  restart the  indus-   tries of Europe and  to  avert  this impending catastrophe.
THE CHANCELLOR,    It is left &quot;by the Treaty to the Reparation   Commission to allow to Germany such food and raw materials.   as the Commission thinks are necessary out of the first   sums which would otherwise he taken for reparation.    I1   think the first charge,  if I remember rightly, is the Army   of Occupation, and next to that there are such supplies as   the Reparation Commission think necessary.LORD ROBERT CECIL:   I could not tell you exactly which order  . they take.Sir CHARLES ADDIS:   One further point, a comparatively minor   one, is that I think a great deal of the credit being   given just now is of a highly dubious character, a good   deal of It speculative,  and such a Committee as I have re-   ferred to, if appointed with the authority of an International   Conference, might, I think, do a great deal to regularise   the credit which is now being given In this country in this   haphazardous and sporadic way.THE CHANCELLOR:   I cannot help feeling that what you speak  . of is a real danger to us, at the present time.  The Home   demand is immense.  Outside the Home demand,  I suppose,   our manufacturers would not have the slightest difficulty   in disposing at profitable prices of their manufactures in   markets where they could be paid cash; that is to say, in the   Americas.  They would either pay them in cash or in goods   which we must have.  To divert our  energies to supplying on   long credit countries which cannot pay us while we ourselves   are debtors, seems to me a very dangerous situation.  Do   you follow?Sir CHARLES ADDi&apos;8;   I do.  That particular danger was referred   to  in the Memorial.  That  is one way in which, the credit   could be regularised.  At present I  think a good deal  of   credit Is being given to countries  who are not able  to pay   on  account of the high rate of profit that can be obtained
   by the granting of long credit.  And, in my opinion,  a   Conference would do a good deal to check that matter which,   I think, is rather increasing.THE CHANCELLOR:  I think our manufacturers, or our merchants,   are too much tempted by the high rate of profit,  and do  not   have sufficient regard to the length of time before they   receive payment or the uncertainty of whether they will   receive payment at the moment they expect to.Mr GOOLEBOUGH:  I confirm what Sir Charles Addis says as   to there being a  /great deal of business now being done  with   various countries of Europe on long terms of credit;  and it   is certainly very dangerous indeed.  My point of view is   that until certain preliminary steps have been taken In   the matter of reform of currency and compelling countries   to realise that they must live within their means, any   dealings with them are full of danger.   Those seem to me   matters for the Governments of those countries, and I cannot   see that any approach by private individuals to those  ! Governments would be so effective as an approach by the   Government of this country, coupled with other countries9   to make representations upon the subject,  and to point   out what are the essential preliminaries in the matter of   Home Reform of Currency,  and of living within their means,   with a view to the restoration of trade.  Whether America   comes in or not at the present time,  I do not think is   material; at a later date I have no doubt she will be   very glad to  come in when advice has been given and has   been followed,LORD ROBERT CDCIL:  I do not know whether you would  allow   me to add one word.   I do not know whether this would meet   your views at all,  but it seems to me it will be  possible   to combine something in the nature of Mr Glass&apos;s  warning,
 Conference,  as a  preliminary to the  issue of  your summons to the  Conference; and to make it quite  clear what  the financial policy of the  British Government was  if you still thought a Conference was desirable,  I do not know whether  some  combina- tlon of the  two might meet your views0  The only other thing. I  want to say  is  rather  in support of what has  just been said,. Take the case  of  Poland  again as an  illustration.  It is at any rate  freely said  that France  is encouraging Poland in her extravagance;,   I  do not know  whether it  is true, but I  myself believe  it is true.  That,  really, is  because a section of the French Government is  pursuing  one policy quite irrespective of the financial position8  Well,  you can only cure that if you  can  get some joint  Conference  of the Govern- ments  as a whole  to really realise what the situation is. As long as Poland is  being encouraged in  extravagance by one  of the Allies it  is  hopeless  to  expect that she will put her  House in order,, AUCKLAND GSDDSS:   Mr  Chancellor  of the Exchequer,  l&apos;find myself in this position.,  I have  road the Memorial, and as I understood it the object was  to get Europe  restarted by getting her  first equipped,  as  she began  to behave,  country by country in  raw material so that manufactures and  Indus- tries  might  be started,,   Mr McEenna  this  afternoon spoke of a sum of   20,000,000  as the  sum  of value  for which credit will have to be allowed  for British  raw  material,McKSMA:  No0  We contemplate,  if these countries are re- started internally, reopening normal trade relations with them.   If the  problem is too  big for ordinary trade   credits to suffice,  it night take the form of a Government guarantee, not only this Government, bat the other neutral Governments, and, possibly; it might take the form in certain cases of an
   actual advance.Sir AUCKLAND desire:   Mr McKenna,  I have been working  on  this   for a long time.  How do you hope to get the  internal   businesses of any of these countries anything like  right   with their expenditure even approaching to the level of   their income until they have got the first equipment of   raw material.  Take Poland alone.  Suppose the Polish Army   were reduced to the slightest frontier Guard which  would be   safe for her to maintain on her Austrian frontier.   At the   present moment her Textile industries at Warsaw are very   largely at a standstill.  A certain amount of work  is being   done on raw material that is being provided,  but until   she has got those industries going, and until she has   another harvest, how can she possibly bring her Government   expenditure down to her income, because she has no  income.Mr McKENMA:   She has no revenue.Sir AUCKLAND GEDDES:   She has no State income which is worth   speaking of.Mr MoKENBA:   I imagine it is always possible for a State   to live inside  its income.,  If the proposition is correct,   as you have stated it, there is no remedy;   it must go from   bad to worse.Sir AUCKLAND GEDDES:   Is it always possible for a State to   get inside its  income in one year?Mr. McKEMHA:   I will not fix myself to a  limit  of time, but   if, as you put  it, she cannot  get her expenditure inside   her revenue until  she has had  a very large advance  of money,   which  I understand to be your  proposition, and nobody is   going  to lend her  that money,  then  I can  see  no hope for   her.   I personally do not take that view.Sir AUCKLAND GEDDES:   That-  is not  quite what I  tried  to say,Mr McIMM:  At this moment Poland  is getting considerable   trade  advances.   I know oi some  myself  that  she is  getting.
   She would get more If there was a prospect of hor Government   being a settled. Government,  and that she was  going to  live   inside her income.Sir AUCKLAND GEDDBS:  Yes.  but as I understand the Memorial ;  the idea is that this Government guarantee or assistance,   whatever form it might take, should not be made available   until the State which is to get the assistance has managed  - to get inside her income.Mr BRAND.  Until the taxation is imposed,  or until there  is   evidence that that is going to be the case.Sir AUCKLAND GSDDSS:  But how can these people at the present   moment impose taxes,  or devise taxes?Mr BRAND:  Poland is a bad instance to take, because the  great   tiling is to deal with Western Europe.  If you could deal   with franca, Italy, Germany, and Belgium you would have   solved the problem,.Sir AUCKLAND GEDDES:  You think so.Mr BRAND:  Well, more or less.Sir AUCKLAND GUDDBS:  Do hot you think Germany is geographically   the heart of the problem?Mr BRAND:  Yes,,Sir AUCKLAND GSDDJiiS:  I think Germany is really the  key to the   whole position in Central Europe.THE CHAHCSI&amp;OR:  It is much more easy to talk like a professor   to Poland, or Rumania, about their internal policy than to   franco.  You can do it with countries like Poland, Rumania,   and Serbia, but it is rather difficult, is it not, for a;   Chancellor of the Exchequer to address himself to the French   in public audience of the Nations of Europe,  and to say:   You are the source of the rottenness in Europe; your finance   is rotton from top to bottom.Mr BRAND:  I read last week that Dr. Melohior who was, as   you know, the financial representative  on their side,  gave
    an estimate in which he showed that the Gorman Government    was this year balancing their Budget.   Whether that is really    so or not I do not know,  but surely if Germany,  England,  and    other countries can balance their Budget,  and Italy is mak-    ing much greater efforts  in that direction,  it would not  be    so difficult for France to do something of the kind.THE CHANCELLOR:   I do not say that France will  not do so,    The present Ministry is starting out^on that policy, but    I think it is rather difficult to convey it  to them.Sir ROBERT XINLERSLEY:  As was pointed out one of the objects    of a conference was to get over the very difficulty you are    pointing out at this moment.  I quite  acknowledge that for    you to stand up in public today and give France a dressing    down would be difficult,  but if you had an International    body of experts, or whatever you like  to call them, who    meet together, who lay down certain rules, and who state    that their Governments ought not to make advances except    under those circumstances, surely then your  position is    enormously strengthened, if you Want to say nasty things to    those countries,  Is not  that so? I remember that was one    of the reasons put forward of the advantages of such a Con-    ference as this, that it  relieved the  politicians from    their difficulty which it seems to me  exists today that    M. Clemenceau, and perhaps our owr\ Prime Minister, or some    other Prime Ministers, get together, talk, promises are    made, and hopes held out  without any conditions being laid    down as to what the borrowing country  has to do if it wants    that money.  It is a very delicate situation, as you rightly    point out, but when you have this body who have put down    definitely these rules, then the path  is made perfectly    clear for your address.THE CHANCELLOR.;  It is quite  easy for the  French Financial    representative to say to  me hero in this room that of course                                3.6.*
   before he comes on to  the London market  to  borrow France must   put her Budget  in order,,  and that he  recognises that that   is a prime condition,  but it is  not  easy for  me to go  and   proclaim that to all the  world,  It is not easy for me  to   pick Prance out and lecture her-.Sir &quot;ROBERT EINLERSLEY:  These rules, if  one may  call them so,   that we foresee, are going to apply to all  the countries;   you are not going to single out  France or Belgium, but if   they come to you for money you simply say &quot;Here is our code   of rules. Are you abiding by them?  If not, there is nothing   more to be said, because  I, as an individual, not as Chan-   cellor of&quot;the Exchequer,  have been advised by this body that   no loan should be made except under these conditions *   They   have this body of experts, they believe in their  opinion,   and whatever mine may be  I cannot go  behind it.&quot;  It seems   to me your hands are enormously strengthened  if a body like   this gets to work and lays down certain definite  rules   which have to be abided by*Mr J.H.THOM4S:  Suppose there was common agreement-.,,,  it  does   appear to me you would then have some standing  orders, and   you would be able to say to France, or anyone else,  not   necessarily France: &quot;You have to comply with the  standing   orders; or would it be a better means of getting  over the   difficulty if the League of Nations itself could  be  made   responsible and so relieve the  Government  of any difficulty   in the matter by convening a Conference at the instance of   the British Government,  of  course.TEE  CHANCELLOR:  -I do not know.  Any suggestion of that kind,  I   thinks is worth considering, but my belief is that the   moment you issue an invitation  you are  really considered   to have pledged yourself to make loans  if  certain conditions   are fulfilled.  If you were to  say in advance that the ut-   most you contemplated was  something-  in  the nature of  the
   trade guarantee which we already have  for a further  sum of    20,000,000 - I think we have already put  26,000,000  to   that account, so it is really for a smaller sum.Mr GOODENOUGH;  That  is manufactured goods.THE CHANCELLOR:  It is on the same lines,  and it  is actually   for a smaller amount than we have put  for that purpose, I   think if we announce anything of that  kind they would  consider   we were laughing at them.Mr J.H. THOMAS:  Why need you go to that  extent at all?  Why   not call the Conference to discuss the  situation as  distinct   from laying down proposals in advance?THE CHANCELLOR:  Because, Mr Thomas, my experience is if  you   do that the borrowing Powers will all  respond with alacrity;   they will say &quot;Let us discuss it, how  muoh 6an you lend me?&quot;Mr BRAND: Suppose Holland issued the invitation?THE CHANCELLOR:  Speaking off hand I should consider  that a   better proposal, because it would be the first time  that   the Neutrals have  shown any interest in the general condi-   tion of Europe, or its policy,  The grounds upon which   you put it are common to the whole world, and I  agree  with   you,Mr CHENFELL:  I think the memorialists were of opinion that   it should be Holland, if possible, and not England,  and any   of the belligerents.Mr BRAND:  And the French, I understood,  it was said.Mr McKENNA:  I think Sir Auckland Geddes is a little  unduly   alarmed by it.  The memorialists say the greater  part  of   the funds must necessarily be supplied by those countries   where the trade balance and the exchanges are favourable^   Well, that cannot be said of us.                    -Sir AUCKLAND GJSTDES:   Absolutely or relatively.
Mr McKEHNA:  It must be relative in every case.   In the Argen-   tine and Scandinavia the exchanges are very much batter   than they are with us.   It is not contemplated that we   should be the milch cow; Neutrals are coming in.Sir AUCKLAND GEDDiiiS:   Perhaps we who meet these other people   so often are getting a little bit wary.Mr MoKEBNA:  The Dutch are willing to work.Sir AUCKLAND GEDDE3:  Perhaps they are, but the assumption   always is that when they have reached London they have   reached the milk reservoir, and everything can be got by   begging here.Mr BRAND:  Mr Glass says Government credits and  banking credits   are now bad and should not be allowed at all, and the only   alternative he puts, as I understand, is that the American   private investors shall come to the help of Europe and   provide Europe with working capital.  I do not know to what   extent we think that is really a remedy or not, but that   is the only remedy he suggests.THE CHANCELLOR:  Except buying investments and taking our   gold.  I should have thought that was the last  thing he   wished to see any more of.             I am much obliged to you for coming,  gentlemen.   I think it has been useful to have this talk.   I have shown   you pretty clearly the difficulties which are in my mind.   There is a great deal that is attractive about  the Confer-   ence, but having regard to our special position, and hav-   ing regard to a long series of interviews which over a course   of 12 months I have had with foreign representatives, v;hat   I am really frightened of is raising expectations&apos; that we   are wholly powerless to fulfill.  We shall think over what   you have said to us.  We must discuss it with the rest  of   our colleagues in the Cabinet, and see what we  think are   the best steps to take.  In the meantime I would just like
  to say one thing, it is really repeating what I said at the  beginning, that the Press ha3 interested itself in this  Meeting and has rather suggested that out of it might follow  some full blown scheme&apos; which would be put into execution in  24 hours, and which would right the world in a week.  If you  have occasion or find opportunity to say that the problem  cannot be solved in that way it will be a useful thing to  do, otherwise you get the expectation that something is  going to be done; it does not happen, and then you have a  slump.  If you do something to check expectations which  you and I know cannot be fulfilled by any possible unanimity  I think it would bo a good thingo -Mr BRAND:   I think it has been said pretty often, but they  pay no attention,THE CHANCELLOR:   But if you have an opportunity of repeating  it there will be no harm done.  Then I will merely send a  notice to the Press saying you. came here, you met my collea-  colleagues and myself, we had an interchange of opinion upon the  subject of the Memorial, and that the Government sought  fronTyou a further explanation of your ideasaLORD ROBERT CECIL:   You would not put in a dash of cold water  now in the communication to the Press,THE CHANCELLOR:   We might say that it was generally recognised  that there was no panacea to the exchange, that it was the  result, not the causo, of a world condition, and that noth-  ing but work will set the thing right.LORD ROBERT CECIL:   Whatever you say will be read, of courso,  as you know, in every capital in Europe, and if you could  give them a hint that the really essential thing for them  is to put, their own House in order before anything else is  thought of I should have thought it would be a very good  thingaMT ERAND:   Could it be pointed out that the Memorial said that  first of ail?
THE CHANCELLOR:  That is what we might  say,  that the   Deputation laid stress upon  that line  as  being the   basis of the Memorial, and upon the  educational  effect   such a Conference might have.Sir ROBERT KINDERSLEY:   It has  got round  the Press  that   this suggested Conference was on the question of exohange   which certainly was never intended.Mr J.H.THOMAS:  It has been suggested that  you use  the words   &quot;the educational effect&quot;. I suggest yeu do not  use that   word, because I think it would  &quot;be turned against us.THE CHANCELLOR:  We will consider  that.Mr McKENNA:  I beg to propose a vote of thanks to the   Chancellor of the Exchequer  for receiving us today.THE CHANCELLOR:  I am much obliged.                  (The Deputation withdrew)
