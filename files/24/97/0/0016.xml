DOCKYARD  POLICY  AND  LABOURmorandum for the Cabinet  by the First Lord           of tha Admiralty         I desire to make the following remarks on theMemorandum 0*Po431 which the Shipping Controller has circulateddealing with Dockyard Policy and Labour        (1)  The Shipping Controller states that in November              last year at the request of the Admiralty he              consulted all the principal merchant Shipbuilders              in this country with regard to the possibility              of absorbing the surplus workmen from the              Dockyards^         The Admiralty concur in this statement.     TheAdmiralty were at that time making heavy discharges from theRoyal Dockyards , and it was found that the  men were not beingabsorbed elsewhere, and that unemployment in the  DockyardTowns was increasing to an extent which the Ministry of Labourdescribed as alarming and likely to lead to disorder.         The Shipping Controller, on the other hand, urged thatthe policy of discharge should be oontinued full-blast, andthe Admiralty were anxious, for financial and other reasons,to follow his. advice if it oould be shewn to be based on an accurate knowledge of the situation?(2)   The  Shipping Controller states  that  as  a result  of      those enquiries it  was found that the  outside      Yards could absorb  a very large  number of men end-      that a considerable amount of  house accommodation      was available.         The Admiralty cannot concur in this statement.The only ooncrete facts that emerged from these enquiries were w(a)   that  housing in the mercantile  shipbuilding centres      was  a great difficulty, but that it was believed      that there  would be  enough lodgings for bachelors,      although, few (if any)  married  men with families      oould be  accommodated.(b)   that  if more shipwrights could  be obtained from      the  Royal Dockyards, a large number of men of  other      classes,  at present  unemployed in the shipbuilding      centres,  could be employed5 but a correspondingly      large number of men  of these classes  (whose work      is dependent on the. shipwrights) would have to be      discharged  from the  Royal Dockyards,  and oould      not  be absorbed^         It was in view or&quot; these facts that Lord Oolwyn1sPermittee was set up Jro consider some alternative.         (3)  The Shipping Controller states that he is. informed 1               that men are at.present returning from the North               of England to the Dockyard Towns?         Those facts  are  borne out by the information and advioereoeived throughout the Ministry of Labour, and by the rapid growth of unemployment in the Dockyard Towns when the largedisohargos were operating
         HhQ Admiralty have no ueans of tawing whether this isthe case, but oan definitely state that tho men are not beingentered in the Royal Dockyards&quot;    Ths Royal Dockyards are notentering men. except in isolated cases for some special job:they are still discharging men, although en a smaller so ale *No suggestion has ever&quot;be on entertained that additional men should be entered in tho Royal Dockyards to enable morohantshipbuilding to bo undertaken;-         (4),  Tho Shipping Controller states that the riveters               entered from the Dockyards in a Tyne Yard are               found to be inferior workmen.3         The Admiralty are unable to deal &quot;with suoh a general  -and isolated oritioismv but it is the case that tho rivetting.work&apos; on merchant ships differs semsv/hat from that on warships.,and would require a little time to accustom our men to it: also,it is improbable that the, men hitherto selected for disohargehave been in all cases our&apos; most efficient workmen.         (5)  The Shipping Controller apprehends that tho  ...               building or morohant shijps in tho Dockyards, under               present conditions will involve an expensive               subsidy, and that the Government will be forced               further and further into the polioy/&apos;,         Ths Admiralty a.gree with Lord Celwyn* s Committee, whorecommended the policy not as a permanent one but 0as an&quot;expedient for tiding over a difficult period of distress.&quot;The Committee also.reported that they &quot;hope and expect that in&quot;the present position of the Shipping Trade, tho Admiralty will&quot;bo able to build without any loss.&apos;&quot;     The work;which theAdmiralty hope to undertake,- the building of two Oilers, - iswork of a nature tho&quot;Dockyards are not without experience, andthe Admiralty are confident that it oan be carried out without loss to the Crown.         (6)  The Shipping Controller states that ho submitted               an offer for using a great portion of one of the-               Royal Dockyards for repairing purposes,, which               policy could have been extended to other ports*         The Admiralty point out that this offer and others of asimilar nature were referred to Lord Colwyn&apos;s. Committee j&apos; who reported as follows (giving reasons) :-         jTTe have carefully considered the offers put forward         J by private Shipbuilders to lease portions; of Dockyards         J from the Admiralty, and we have come unanimously to           the conclusion that in no &quot;Dockyardrhas- any such         11 scheme a likelihood of commercial suooess.&quot;(Intlld.)W.&quot; H. L.20/1/20.-
    THE attached report has been prepared by Sir H. Mackinder at the instructionof the Cabinet.    I circulate it in the absence of Lord Curzon.                                        HARDINGE OF PENSHURST.
