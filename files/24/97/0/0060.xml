Supplementary  Report of  the Irish Sub-Committee, on              Clauses dealing with the Imperial Contribution and              Financial  apportionment  between North and South.                    (Circulated for  information.)        The Prime Minister indicated in hie  speech on the 22nd   December last that Ireland would  have the whole yield of Irish     \   taxation in excess of a fair contribution to the Imperial service.   and that during the first two years na fair contribution&quot; would be   assumed to be the amount  actually contributed  in the year 1919/20.   But he pointed out that the figures for that year  are not normal,   and the figures which he  quoted were based on  the  exclusion of   certain items from both sides of  the account as being the temporary   relics of war conditions.   On the  revenue side the yield of Excess   Profits Duty, which is estimated  at-29,000,000, is composed mainly   of arrears in respect of previous years,  and the yield of this   duty has been put at  22,000,000,  being a  rough estimate of  the   Irish share of the tax in respect of the  year  1919/20.  On tho   expenditure side a number of services, such as the Bread Subsidy,   (see particulars in Schedule III  of the Draft  Bill) have been   excluded as being &quot;temporary services arising  out  of circumstances   connected with the war&quot; (C1.9 (5)).  It  is now possible to make.   somewhat closer estimates of the  items of revenue  end expenditure   which go to make up the totals as so adjusted, as  the Supplementary   Estimates for the current year have reached the Treasury.  The   corrections required  in the Prime Minister&apos;s figures are quite   trifling*                Revenue    1919/20         41,365,000              Expenditure 1919/20        219,496,000Surplus                221.369,000

But the figure for  expenditure is the amount voted.This is of course a maximum,  for  no  vote can be exceeded,  andthe savings in the aggregate are  always considerable.  Even ifthe Revenue receipts are no more  than realised, these savings on expenditure will almost  certainly raise the contributionabove. 18,OOOi000.     This fixed contribution of  18,000,000 requires to be apportioned between North and South  Ireland.  The following shows the apportionment of Revenue and  expenditure in so far as itcan be calculated on present information             Total                .Revenue    41,3S&amp;,000ITorth Ireland.      .  14,045,000South Ireland.      .  \&apos;v 27,320,000  :expenditure for 193 3/20&apos;  19,496,000For futureservices.4,000,0004,741,0001,070,00014,756,000 2,930,-00023,496,000fr,811,00017,685,000SXC688 OfRevenue overexpenditure.  17,869,0008,234,0009,635,000These figures,  however,  require modification in two respectsbefore they can be regarded as  giving  a  fair measure of the sums which ought to be contributed.(1)  In the first place the Revenue- includes the  2,000,000 of excess Profits Duty in respect  of  the  year 1919/20*  North Irelandcontributes no less than 6c per cent,  of this Duty, a far larger proportion      than of any other  tax.   Excess profits during thewar hav, followed, in their distribution among firms, industries or localities,  laws peculiar to themselves, and it is probablyunfair /
to North Ireland to assume that she will c^sntr^Fbute so muchas 60 per cent, of any permnent source of Revenue which may take the place of the Excess Profits Duty in the early yearsof operation of the Bill,  It Is reasonable therefore to estimate the contribution of North Ireland towards this tax at 42 per cent..instead of 60 per cent., since 42 per cent, is the proportioncontributed towards the Income Tax*   This correction, whichreduces the assumed yield of Excess Profits in the North from 1,200,000 to  840,000 and increases thevyield in the South from  800,000 to  1,160,000, leads to the following divisionof the Imperial, contribution                    North  -          7,874,000                    South            9,995,000^                                    17,869,000(2)  In the apportionment of expenditure given above, the  4/KH3,000promised by the *rime Minister for pending and future serviceshas been divided in proportion&apos;to the actual services to beprovided for,.so far as these can be foreseen.   But of course this sum is simply &quot;margin&quot;, along with the  3,000,000 of TenantPurchasersx Annuities,.and though a portion of It is required forserv&amp;ces, such as the increased Old Age Pensions and the completion,of land purchase, whichere already in operation or In progress,nearly half Is destined for services which are still entirely inthe future 6   In reality Ireland is being given a margin of 7,000e000 for future developments     The apportionment of the  3,.000,COO of Tenant Purchasers1Annuities, depends on the geographical distribution of the holdings,purchased *   The South gets  2 r 440 e 000 and the North only  560,000.This division, which works out at 1&amp;/6&amp; a head in the South and/** in the North, has no relation whatever to the needs to be&apos;met.The presumption is indeed that the margin for meeting the cost of                                                     instituting/
instituting a separate Government and duplicatingDepartments ought, if anything, to be larger in proportion to population in the smaller community.     It Is recommended accordingly that the wholemargin of  7,000,000 be divided in proportion topopulation.   As Norish Ireland ha3  N3t per cent., or almost        oexactly &quot; of the population of the dole, the North will get  2,000^000 and the South  5 .,000,000*   As they will receive  oSO^GOO and  2^440^000 respectively from theTenant Purchasers1 Annuities, they must have  1,440,000and  8,560,000 out of the other margin of  4,000,000.     This further adjustment will make their contributions i-NorthSouth

It Isthe inequalities of wealth illustrated in these compari-sons that the Joint Exchequer Board has to take intoaccount under the head of taxable capacity.Accordingly the Sub-Committee recommend.&quot;       (lO  That Ireland&apos;s Imperial contribution be        fixed for the first two years at  18,000;000j       (2)  That of this sum  7,560,000 be contributed        by the North and  10,440,000 by the Southj       (3)  That White Papers be presented to Parliament       justifying  these  figures as soon as possible       after the Bill  is circulated.      These proposals  deal with the contributions forthe first  two years.   In the third and  subsequent years the Joint  Exchequer Board will  not only determine the contribution of  Ireland  as  a whole but  will settle the shares of North and  South,  on the basis of  taxable capacity.   It may  be pointed out  that  the  Board isnot expressly directed to  take  account  of  the inequalityin the distribution of the  tenant purchasers1  annuitiesbetween North and  Southo
     Clause 22 deals with the apportionment  of  theIrish residuary share of reserved taxess  Referenceto Clause 20 (2) shows that arrears of excess profitsduty are to be excluded.&apos;   Clause 22 (1)  (b) excludescertain temporary services arising out of the War(Bread Subsidy, etc).  Accordingly the ImperialGovernment will retain the arrears of excess profitsduty and will defray the temporary services* Thereason for this is that it would be inexpedient to embarrass the Irish budgets from the beginning  withthese very large and very uncertain items on bothsides of the account, which would be an inheritancefrom the policy of the Imperial Parliament.      It may be that some of the expenditure itemswill continue after the receipt of arrears of expessprofits duty has ceased.  But in that  case, if Home rule is  already in operation,  it would be  for the applicabilityof  the  services to  Ireland to be settled by agreementbetween the  Imperial  and  Irish Parliaments.  If newtaxes are necessary to pay for,  say,  a continuance of -the Bread Subsidy,  either the new  taxes  can be made applicable to  Ireland, or the Irish Parliament  canbe  left to deal with  the  whole matter as an Irishservice.2, Whitehall Gardens, SJ,    February 5rd.l920.
