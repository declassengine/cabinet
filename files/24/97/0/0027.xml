                             TAW OP PROPERTY BILL,                                                    (CP.  525)25tfith  reference  to my  memorandum/of  the             27th  January  and tho  papers which were  circulated             with  it,  it occurs  to me  that possibly  my  colleagues             in the  general  press  of &quot;business ma&quot;  not have found             time  completely to  master the details of the  Bill,                       I think that I  should inform  them that the             Bill  is non-controversial in its nature and has             received  the  support  of all the eirpert  opinion             available  upon  the  matters with which it deals.  I             am persuaded  that if  passed it  will effect a most             beneficial change and that its  passing  will reflect             oredit  upon the  Government.                       In  these  circumstances, unless any member             of tho  Cabinet  has  any desire for a discussion upon             the Bill,  I propose to introduce it in  the House of             Lords at  an early date.14th February 1920*
158Confidential.Law of  Property  Bill.   [H.L.]MEMORANDUM.     This Bill will effect a greater simplification  in  the  practiceof  conveyancing,  without  however  destroying  the  power  tosettle land, than  any measure  hitherto  proposed.  The generalproposals  are  discussed in a  pamphlet, &quot;The  Line of  LeastResistance,&quot; by Mr.  Arthur Underhill.   The main  object is toassimilate  the  law  of  real and personal estate.  The general principle is enacted  in clause one, which  puts freehold  andcustomary  land  on the same  footing  as leaseholds, and repealsthe  Statute of  Uses.  This  principle  is worked  out  in  thedifferent  parts  of the  Bill.   By  itself the  general  principle would not do much  to  assist a purchaser, for, to obtain a goodtitle, he not only has to acquire the fee simple or the  term ofyears  which  he  buys,  but has to see that  the equities  and charges  affecting  the land are bound.     Hence  the  Bill places all interests in land, except  legalestates in fee simple or for a term  of years absolute,  behind acurtain  consisting of either a  trust for sale  or a  settlement,and  frees  a purchaser  in good faith from any obligation  to look  behind the  curtain.   By this  method,  with  the  aid  ofthe  provisions  relating  to  mortgages and the  legal  estate,  the reforms  sought  in  Lord  Haldane&apos;s Bill of   1915  are,  withinsignificant exceptions, carried out, without the complicationsincidental  to that scheme,  without  inventing  any new no men-clature,  and without setting   up a register  of cautions andinhibitions.     The persons  interested in  equitable interests are  secured by provisions  under  which, unless  a, corporation, such  as  thePublic Trustee,  or a bank  is  acting  as trustee, the  purchase money or other  capital money must (unless title is made by a personal  representative) be  paid to at  least  two trustees.   Ifthere are no trustees to whom the  capital  money can be paid,or they cannot  be appointed without  an application to the  court,then title can  be made  by joining the persons interested.   If,however,  no capital  money arises  under   the  transaction,  a tenant for  life  or statutory owner  can, if  the  transaction is within his  powers,  give  effect  to  it  in favour of a lessee,26-1a
Law of Property.[10 GEO. 5.]whether  or not  trustees have been appointed.  The  doctrine oflis pendens is left  unimpaired, and to some extent is extended.     The result will be that abstracts of  title  in  the  future  will consist of  simple transfers  to  persons  of full  age  of the legalestates, either  absolute  or by way  of  mortgage by demise orsubdemise, interspersed  with  vesting  orders, vesting declarations,leases, probates,  and letters of administration.     Dealings with  a life estate will no  longer  affect a purchaserof the settled land, in this respect they are placed on  the same footing as dealings with estates in remainder.     Legal  mortgages  of  freeholds  will   take  effect  only  bymeans  of  a  long term  of  years,  with  the  result  that  themortgagor  will  have the  legal  fee simple.   Proper  provision is,  however, made to  secure to the  mortgagee his  rights tofixtures, and  to maintain  the right to tack  and make  furtheradvances.  When a mortgagee of freeholds sells under  his powerof  sale, Nthe legal   fee  simple will be  vested  in  the  purchaserby the conveyance.  When he obtains  an  order for foreclosureabsolute,  the legal fee  will  vest  in him. When he  obtains atitle under the  Statutes of  Limitation,  he is  given  power to enlarge the long term into a legal  fee simple.   Legal leaseholdmortgages will always take effect  and  be  made by subdemise.Outstanding bare  legal estates  are got   in  by the Bill.   Thisenactment, taken   with the   provisions relating  to mortgages,renders it possible to make the  legal estate the  basis  of  futureconveyancing.   A  purchaser  or  a transferee  for value is  freed from investigating trusts affecting  mortgage debts.     The  Satisfied  Terms Act, 1345,  is made  to  apply  to termscreated out of leasehold interests.     Interests  in land  will  become  divisible  into  two  classes.First, the &quot; legal  estate&quot;  in  fee simple or for  a  term of yearsabsolute;   and,  secondly, &quot; equitable  interests,&quot;   which  will include all other interests  in  land.     It will also  be possible to have equitable  estates  in fee simple  or  for  terms  of  years  absolute  under  settlements,including wills,  but a purchaser of the settled land  will not be concerned with  them.     In  future  a  vendor  will  not  be  allowed  to throw on  a purchaser  of the  fee simple  or term   the onus  of getting  in the legal  estate, but  no hardship will  arise on this account.
[10 GEO. 5.]Law of Property.    No  difficulty in  regard to  undivided  shares  in  land will arise; the  entirety of the land is by the  Bill vested in trusteesfor sale  with whom a purchaser  will deal, without investigating the title to  the shares.  In this  respect  the Bill goes beyondLord  Haldane&apos;s  measure;  the  Partition  Acts are  repealed, forafter  the  Act comes into force  no  undivided share  will  be capable  of being created,  except  by a settlement, and then  ismade to take effect  behind a trust for sale in respect of the proceeds of  sale of the  land and  of the  rents and profits untilsale.  This reform alone will save very  heavy costs and  securegreat  simplification.   Power is  given to  partition  among thepersons  interested in  the land  until sale.     The law relating to leaseholds, if applied, without amendment,to other land, would  not be sufficiently elastic to meet everydayrequirements,  accordingly  estates  tail or entailed interests are,by the Bill,  authorised to be created in equity, behind the curtain,in  regard  to personal estate as well as real estate.  This in itselfwill enable  real and personal estate  to  be settled by the sameclause and will  make for  simplification.     Further the repeal of the  Statute  of Uses makes it necessary to provide,  first, that reservations of  interests,  for legal  estates, created  de  novo,  such  as a rentcharge,  an  easement,  or a right  to  work  excepted  minerals,   may  take effect  without a grant from the person  to  whom  the land is  conveyed; and secondly,  to devise a scheme for confirming  legal estates which, by  reason  of  some  technical  defect, niay be  invalid,  and  the subsequent  dealings  therewith.     Moreover,  it would  hardly  satisfy  modern ideas  to apply the existing law relating to the  devolution  of  leaseholds on an intestacy  to land  generally ; accordingly  it  is proposed  to give the real and  personal estate on an intestacy              (1) If  a husband  or  wife  survives and there  are        issue,  to  the  surviving  spouse  absolutely  if  the estate        available  for distribution  does  not exceed  500Z.  If it        exceeds  that  amount,  to the  surviving  spouse  for  life,        and  after his  or  her death to the issue.      Formerly the  husband would have  taken  the whole of  the  personal  estate, and  possibly an estate for  life  by the curtesy in  the  real  estate; while  the wife would have  taken a first charge      26                       a 2
ivZaw of Property.[10 GEO. 5.]for 500Z., her dower,  and half  of the  personalty if there were no issue, or a third if there were issue.            (2) If  there are issue,  but  no surviving  spouse,  the       whole to the issue immediately.     This follows  the  old  personalty rule,  but there  is no object,subject to proper  provisions for maintenance, in the issue takingunless they  attain full age  or  marry            (3) If there is a surviving spouse but no  issue,  the       whole to the surviving spouse absolutely, whether or  not       the estate  exceeds  500 . in value.           (4) If both parents survive, and failing  a spouse, or       issue, then to the surviving parents equally.     Under the old personalty  law the father would have takenall failing a spouse or issue.           (5) If  one  parent  survives,  and failing  a spouse  or       issue, the whole to the surviving parent.     Under  the  old law, the father would have  taken  the whole,but the mother, if surviving, would have shared with the brothersand  sisters.           (6) Subject  as above,  the  Statutes of  Distribution       are to apply; the  Crown takes in default of next-of-kin.     The objection to a surviving spouse taking  a  life  interest isthat this  postpones distribution. The large majority of intestates&apos;estates  are very  small, in  value; hence it is suggested that,where the  estate  available for  division  does   not  exceed, say,500?.,  the spouse  should take  absolutely.  The fixing  of anysuch  sum must give rise to arbitrary results, which are  difficultto justify save as a practical solution.     But whatever interests  are decided  on,  it is submitted thatthe real and personal estate ought to devolve  together to  avoid the difficulties and costs which  have arisen or have been incurred in the past by reason  of the property devolving in  different ways.     The  general  principle  of  the Bill is  worked out  in  thefollowing manner:            Part I. contains  the  main  machinery requisite  for       dealing   with   mortgages,   the legal  estate  settlements,       trusts for sale,  cases  of  disability,  and  undivided shares,
       for working out the assimilation scheme, and  for carrying       out  the principal objects  of Lord Haldane&apos;s  Bill of 1915       without complication.     Incidentally it affords reasonable protection to  a  purchaser against claims for death duties, and  in  respect  of  bankruptcies on the principles respectively arranged with the Inland Revenue and the Board of Trade when Lord Haldane&apos;s Bill was introduced.     Where land is held on  trust  for sale the  trustees for  sale are, by- this Part of the Bill,  given  the statutory  powers  of  a tenant for  life.            Part II. contains the amendments of the Settled Land       Acts, which, after  thirty-seven years of experience,  have       been  found to be requisite.   The principle  that, subject       to  proper safeguards being provided for the remaindermen,       the tenant  for life or other statutory owner  of full  age       should be  placed on  approximately the  same footing as       an absolute owner, has been adopted.     So far as this Part of  the  Bill gives additional  powers or facilities  to deal  with or manage  land, extends  the class of statutory  owners  by whom the powers  of a tenant for life are to be exerciseable, or removes the difficulties arising in  connexion with compound and referential settlements, or the appointment of  trustees  for the purposes  of the Acts,  it should  be regarded as essential to the principal  object of  the Bill.     The provisions relating to  improvements and the application of capital money, however desirable in  themselves, cannot be so regarded.     In future the  Settled Land Acts will not apply  to land held on  trust for sale,  for the requisite provisions  in regard to  such land  are  now supplied in Part  I. of the Bill.  The  statutory powers are vested in the trustees  for  sale who can delegate themto the persons interested in the  rents and profits until sale; if the trustees refuse to carry out a  transaction the Court is  given powerto act.           Part III. contains amendments of the Conveyancing       Acts.  These amendments so far as they simplify dealings       with  land or the forms  of  assurances may be treated as       incidental  to the main scheme, but the provisions relating       to the maintenance of infants must stand or fall exclusively       on  their merits.
           Part IV. contains amendments of the  Trustee A.cts.      Those relating to the restriction of the number of Settled      Land  Act trustees  arid of  trustees for  sale,  the power  to      distribute  an  estate  after  advertising  for  claims, the      appointment of  trustees, vesting declarations  and vesting      orders  are incidental  to the  main scheme.  Unless the      number of the trustees of  a settlement or trustees holding      land   on  trust for  sale  were  restricted,  land could  in      effect  be made unsaleable; this restriction does not apply      to charitable trusts.    The supplementary powers  given to trustees are designed  to shorten  legal documents, these powers and the  provisions as  to insurance money are outside the  scheme.           By Part V., copyhold tenure is abolished, saving only      the  pecuniary benefits  which accrue  to the  bid,  and,      pending the  extinguishment  of  these  benefits, provision      is made  for  dealing with  the land  as freehold,  without      prejudice to the lord&apos;s rights.           By  Part  VI., provision  is  made for  the  ultimate      extinguishment of  all manorial incidents, whether affecting      land  formerly  copyhold  or  other  land,  within  at  most      ten years.  These two  parts  are framed  in  accordance      with  the requirements of  the Board  of  Agriculture and      Fisheries, with  a  view  to enabling the  incidents  to  be      extinguished, in  the majority  of  cases,  by the  parties      concerned, without the aid of the Board.     The existence  of  copyhold tenure  stands in the way  of  allfar reaching land-law reform.   The  active operation of  Parts  V.and VI. will cease at the end  of ten years.           By Part VII., perpetually renewable leaseholds (not       being  renewable  copyholds  which are enfranchised) are       Converted into long  terms.   Future leases for lives at a       rent,  and the doctrine of  interesse termini  are abolished.       There is no justification  for allowing perpetually renewable       leases to be granted, the  practice is as expensive as it is       useless.  Moreover,  in many cases  the  renewable leases       are granted for lives,  this  involves  obtaining  evidence       of  the deaths of  the  cestuis que vie.   This  is  wholly       contrary to  the general  principle of the  Bill.
           A term of years must take effect in possession within      21  years from the date of the grant, hut for this proposed      restriction on  the creation of future legal interests the title      to land could  be rendered unnecessarily  complicated;  the      restriction  does  not apply to  equitable terms  (e.g.,  for      raising portions) created by a settlement.           Part VIII. deals with the devolution of the beneficial      interests in real and personal estate on an intestacy, and      carries  out the  general principle enacted  in  clause one,      with amendments, as above  explained, affecting  both the      real and personal estate.    The order and  manner in which  the  beneficiaries  ought totake is an  open question, all that is essential is that, as in otherparts  of the  Bill,  the  same  law  should, subject only  to  thenecessary   qualifications incident to the inherent nature  of  theproperty,  be made  to  apply to  real and personal estate without distinction.           Part IX. repeals and replaces with amendments Part I.(...--*.   of  the Land Transfer Act, 1897, relating  to the devolution      of real estate  on death to the  personal representative, which      has given  rise to unnecessary trouble in practice.    Apart from  the defects of  the part of the statute repealed,the new enactment is essential to  the general scheme,  first becauseon the death of a tenant for life of full age or other sole statutoryowner  the settled   land  will,  under  Part  I., devolve  on   his personal representative, who  will by  writing  assent  to  the samevesting  in the person next entitled, and secondly because underPart VIII. the  law relating to  the devolution of  beneficialinterests is altered.    The only clause in Part IX. which is  outside the scheme isthat which abolishes  the  need  to grant  probate or letters ofadministration to a syndic on behalf of a corporation.           Part  X.  deals  with  the  amendments of  the Land      Transfer Acts required to bring those  Acts into  line with      the general  law as  altered by  the  foregoing  parts of      this  Bill (which are so  designed as  to fit  in  with  the      scheme  of the  *Acts and to  effect  therein  considerable      simplification), and to give effect to the recommendations      of   the  Royal Commission  as   varied   by  those  of   the      Land  Transfer  Committee   recently  appointed.   In
       particular it will be  noted that a satisfactory proposal is       made in  regard to  the machinery  relating to the gradual       introduction of compulsory registration of title  on sale  in       areas to be denned by Orders in Council.     The definitions  are placed in a  separate part at the end  ofthe Bill.     Though the Bill, as a  whole, is long, the  greater part of itconsists of provisions for the abolition of the existing  law.  Theworking machinery which will ultimately be left will be short,and, as compared with the  mass of statute and other law  actuallyrepealed or  rendered  obsolete, will  be wholly  insignificant.   Infact the  length of   the  Bill is entirely  attributable   to  thecomplexities of  the law which it is  intended to simplify.    It is proposed,  by a separate memorandum, which can beissued  as  a White Paper, to explain the  details of this measure.    It is recognised that, if and when the  Bill is passed, measures will he required for consolidating the  different branches of thestatute law affected.   Also rules  of  court, rules to  be made  bythe  Board  of  Agriculture  and  fisheries and  new  rules underthe Land Transfer Acts will be required.  On this  account it isnroposed that the Act should not come into force until  1921.    The statute  law rendered  obsolete, which is not expresslyrepealed  by the  Bill,  can   be  dealt  with  by a  Statute  law revision  Act, or  by  a  Bill specially prepared for  this  purpose in which  consequential  amendments can  be  made.

(3)  Unless the extinguishment  is effected  by  agreement          independently  of the Copyhold  Act, 1894,  the  provisions  of that 30          Act  shall,  subject to the  amendments thereto effected by and          for  the  purposes   of this Part of  this Act, apply to  the  extin-          guishment  of  manorial incidents extinguished by or  under this          Act  and  to   land affected  by  such  extinguishment  as  if          &quot; extinguishment&quot; were  therein   substituted  for  &quot; enfranchise- 35          ment&quot; and &quot; land  affected  by extinguishment&quot; were substituted          for  &quot; enfranchised  land &quot; :              Provided that in the absence of agreement as to  the amount          of the compensation payable  on  the  extinguishment  of manorial
   incidents  affecting enfranchised  land that compensation  shall,  A.D. 1920.   subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act,  be  such as   would have been  payable  for the enfranchisement  of the land   affected if it had  not  been  enfranchised by Part V. of this Act, 5 and  the manorial  incidents  not&apos; saved by that Part had not been   extinguished.        (4) For  facilitating  compensation agreements,  any person   who,  on a sale, would be able  to  dispose of the  land affected   by manorial incidents  or  of the manor (as the case may be) shall10 have  power to agree to the creation of a compensation rentcharge   in like manner as  if a power for that purpose had been conferred   in extension of the powers conferred by  any statute or instru-  *  .   ment under which the land or the  manor (as the  case  may be)   could  have been  sold, and subject  to the  consent  in writing15 of any incumbrancer  whose consent  or concurrence  is  required   on a  sale  of the land  being obtained, the rentcharge so created   (whether perpetual or terminable) shall have the same priority as   if it had been  created under an  award of the Minister.        (5) Where a compensation agreement provides that the com-20&quot;pensation  is to be an annual rentcharge (whether  perpetual or   terminable) issuing out of and to be charged on the land com-   prised in  the  agreement or  any  part  thereof,  that agreement   shall  operate  by virtue of  this Act as a grant  by all necessary   parties  of  an  annual rentcharge  of  the agreed  amount  issuing25 out  of  the land  agreed to  be charged  therewith  of  the  like   nature and with the like  incidents as if the  agreement had been   effected under the Copyhold Act, 1894, as amended by this Act.        (6) Where the compensation (whether ascertained by a com-   pensation agreement or under the Copyhold Act,  1894, as applied30 by this Act) is to  be a gross sum then the  land formerly affected   by the  manorial incidents shall, in priority to any other incumbered-   brances (except tithe rentcharge  and any charge having priority   by statute), stand charged  with  the  payment  of that sum  and   interest thereon payable half-yearly at the rate of  five pounds per35 cent,  per annum from the date of the  extinguishment until paid,   and for the purpose of  recovering the  same the person entitled to   give a receipt therefor shall, after the expiration of  six months   from  the  time when the amount was  ascertained, have all the   powers  conferred  by the  Conveyancing Act,  1881 (as amended40 by  any subsequent enactment)  on a  mortgagee by  deed  whose   power of  sale has  arisen, and as if the  land had been demised
A.D. 1920.  to him for a term of three thousand years without impeachment          of waste by  way  of  first mortgage.              (V) A receipt for  any gross  sum  payable  for  compensation          and the interest  thereon  shall be a sufficient discharge for the          same if given  by                                             5              (a) The lord,  where the agreement is effected under Part  II.                    of the  Copyhold Act,  1894;              (b) The  person  who  would  have been entitled  to give a                    receipt for  purchase money arising on a sale of the                    manorial incidents, where the agreement is not effected 10                    under  Part  II. of  that Act.    ,   *       (8) If it appears to the Minister that it is the general wish          of the lord and the tenants of  any manor that the Minister should          assist  the  parties in arriving at compensation  agreements, the          Minister  may  give such assistance,  and  may  for that purpose 15          employ an officer  of  the Ministry or any other person possessing          special knowledge of the matters in  question.              (9) Where the  manorial  incidents  formerly affecting any          land  have been extinguished, then under a contract  to sell and          convey the freehold, the purchaser shall  not, in the absence of 20          any stipulation to the  contrary, have  the  right  to call for the          title  of the  person,  entering into any compensation  agreement          or giving  a  receipt  for the compensation money, to  enter into          such agreement or to give such receipt, and shall not be deemed          to be affected  with notice of any matter or thing of  which,  if 25          he had contracted that such title should be furnished,  he might          have had notice.              (10)  The,  forms  of  compensation  agreement  and receipt          for compensation  money contained in  Part I. of the Thirteenth          Schedule  to this  Act  may, when effected otherwise  than under 3()          the  Copyhold Act, 1894,  be  used, with such  variations as  the          circumstances  of  each case  may  require,  and shall  be  deemed          sufficient  in  the cases  to which such forms apply.              (11)  The  lord and the  tenant or  other persons authorised to          effect the compensation agreement, may in writing agree that any 35          estate or right of the lord  which is  preserved  by the Twelfth  .          Schedule  to  this Act, shall be treated as a manorial incident and          be extinguished as if it were a manorial incident saved by Part V.          of this Act or that  there shall  be  granted to the lord as com-          pensation  or as part of the compensation for the extinguishment 40          of manorial  incidents,  any estate or  right  of  the tenant or any          right  of  way-or  other easement  in-or over the  land affected for
   more effectually winning and carrying away any mines or minerals  A.D. 1920.   under the land, including any right to let down  the surface:       Provided  that where any  such agreement relates  to mines   or minerals  the consideration for the  estate  or  right  shall  he 5 determined by agreement and not otherwise, and  the  estate  or   right if acquired from the lord shall be conveyed separately.       (12) When all  manorial incidents have been  extinguished   as respects the whole of the land comprised in a manor,  the   lord shall cause the court rolls  to  be  sent to  the Master of  the10 Rolls  at the Public Record Office.       126.

(8) An  ad  valorem  fee  may  be   charged  for a  caution25 specially   prescribed  under this section,  but if  and  when a   mortgage protected  by such a caution is  registered as  a charge   any ad valorem fee paid in respect of the caution  may be taken   towards satisfaction of the fees payable  on such registration of   the mortgage.30      (9) Rules shall be made for giving effect to the provisions of   this section, and in particular  for providing in what  case docu-   ments, or copies thereof, shall be left at the registry, for providing   for the marking of documents not retained at the registry, and   for extending and adapting the provisions of this section to the35 case of submortgages:                      ,       Provided that where             (a) The  mortgage  relates also  to  property  other  than                  registered land;  or            (b)  The mortgage is only protected by a caution; or j                   26             S

Compensation  for  timber shall be ascertained  as follows:    Where by a special custom of  the manor the lord can enter upon the   land,  and cut and carry away the timber without the consent of the10 tenant, its whole value, after  making a sufficient allowance for repairs,   shall  be given  to the  lord.  But  where  there  is no  special custom,   so that  the ordinary  law of copyholds is applicable  and therefore the   lord cannot enter and cut  without  the consent of the tenant,  one  half   only of  its value, after making a sufficient allowance for repairs, shall15 be given.   If there be any other special custom in the  manor relating   to timber, such custom shall be regarded.                              Other Incidents.        13.

Other Rights  reserved.        14.

In the case of an extinguishment  of  manorial incidents by joint 35 tenants, the  compensation for fines, and heriots, if any, shall  be based    upon  such a  single  life as  may be  equivalent  to  the expectation of    survivorship  of the  joint  lives  according  to  the   rules  and  tables    appended to the Succession  Duty Act, 1853.

      KIQ Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government                L4W OP BRQPSfiTY BILL.                                     (CP. 525)          With reference to my memorandum/of the27th January and tho papers which were oiroulatedwith it, it occurs to me that possibly my colleagues in the general press cf business ma:&quot; not have foundtime completely to master the details of the Bill,          I think that I should inform them that theBill is non-controversial in its nature and hasreceived the support of all the expert opinionavailable upon the matters with which it deals.  Iam persuaded that if passed it will effect a mostbeneficial change and that its passing will reflect 1oredit upon the Government.          In these circumstances,  unless any memberof tho Cabinet ha3 any desire for  a discussion uponthe Bill, I propose to introduce it in the House ofLords at an early datea14th February 1920.
