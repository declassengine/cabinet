Medical Staff  2,300besides an addition of some 2,000 men  old and infirm. he added that transports had  sailed for Black Sea Ports.      Commander-in-Chief has been  informed that it isimpossible to  evacuate refugees from Russian ports,  for, onsanitary grounds, no  country will receive them.      The  Cabinet have decided that  the  only  evacuation that can be undertaken is  from  Novorossisk  to  the Crimea  or  otherRussian port  in  accordance with promise made by Mr.  Mackinder. *The/
      The S.S. &quot;PANAMA&quot; with refugees has  arrived at  Malta,hut owing to typhus on hoard, refugees are not allowed toland and the only alternative Is for the ship to return to the black Sea.  If any other ships are en route to Malta  withrefugees they have been ordered to he re-called.      Rear-Admiral, 2nd in Command left Malta on 28th Januaryin &quot;STUART&quot; accompanied by &quot;MONTROSE&quot; for Black Sea.

The situation In Crimea reported on 27th was that theBolsheviks were checked on the Perekop line, but it wasconsidered doubtful whether this line would be held undersevere attack.      In South Russia, the Caspian Flotilla at Petrovsk were reported to be active and efficient, but short of ammunition.Novorossisk not  in immediate danger.  Bolsheviks being heldalong Don and Manitch Rivers north of Kizliar.      No effective measures are being taken at Odessa toprepare for defence.  The town Is not in immediate clanger.      If General Denikin considers It necessary to sendadditional Russian Troops for defence of the Crimea and hasnot sufficient transport, assistance will be given so  ar ascapacity of available British transports permits.      Azerbaijan has communicated to HcM. Government that,in case  of necessity, the Volunteer Caspian Flotilla would-beallowed  to use Baku, but  only on  condition that effectualcontrol  was in British hands.  Crews might remain Russian butit was essential Officers should  be British, as Azerbaijancannot trust  Volunteer Army  policy.                     MEDITERRANEAN.       &quot;DUBLIN&quot; will not proceed to the  Africa  Station for thepresent  but will be temporarily attached  to  Mediterranean.

DANUBE.       Admiral Troubridge  arrived at  Vienna on January 17th and  resumed command.       A Press report  states  that owing to the Danube having risen to an abnormal  height  it  Is rendering navigation Impossible,  and  thereby increasing the difficulties  of feeding the  populace       Thousands  are now in a lamentable condition,  and unless something is  done soon the situation threatens to become nearly as bad for the  poor  as that  of Vienna.                      EGYPT.       &quot;IVY&quot; and &quot;BRYONY&quot;  have lately been employed in main- taining W/T communication for the Military.  Rear-Admiral, Egypt has been informed that he is not to guarantee the presence of H*  M. Ships at any particular place for this purpose       &quot;ARK ROYAL&quot; has been ordered to Port Said and will probably return to England shortly.                      CHINA.       &quot;MOORHEN&quot; was ordered on 26th January to Macao with orders to watch the situation there and keep Commander-in^Chief informed.  The trouble was caused by the Portuguese undertaking                                                     harbour/

Arrangements have been made to embark British subjects in event of serious disturbances arising.                       GERMANY.^a^y^  i^!l32 l*  ^ return presented by the German PeaceUoimnissTon &quot;shows that 235.967 naval ranks and ratings had beendemobilised up to 25 December 1919, leaving a total strengthof 39,253.   &quot;                 n      According to the Peace ^treaty the total strength must bereduced to 15,000, but the Supreme Council have approved thetemporary detention of an additional 10,000 ranks and ratingsto be employed exclusively fonbine-sweeping.   This number  willbe progressively reduced from time to time as the Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control shall determine, in such manner that, at the end of eight months after the coming into forceof the Peace Treaty, the personnel of the German Navy shallnot exceed 15,000.                       ITALY.      It was reported on 28th January that the AustrianLight Cruiser &quot;NOVARA&quot; had sunk  off Brindisi whilst beingtowed from Cattaro by two French tugs.

Another ship - the &quot;TARANTO&quot; has been diverted to Flumeon her way to San Giovanni di Medua with  stores and some,000,000 lire for the Italian troops in  Albania.  She was apparently forced to change her  course by Flume volunteershidden on board.   Money and  stores will  prove welcome toD&apos;Annunzio, whose funds are said to be very low.                       FRANCE.
