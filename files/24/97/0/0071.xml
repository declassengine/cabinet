They have  taken underreview all of the Establishments maintained by the Admiralty,  the WarOffice, and the Air Force, which are engaged in research,  experimentand design for the active prosecution of war.   The SuVCommittee havenot considered the medical services of the fighting forces,  or re-search in relation to. these, though as is indicated below the questionof physiology arises incidentally in connection with the proposals  ofthe War Office for research in Chemical Warfare.2.  The Sub-Committee agree that no question of overlapping arisesunder existing conditions in connection with the work of the Organ!-sat ions and Stations mentioned below and that  civilian interests  arenot involved in these cases    War Office.

Accordingly the Secretary of the Committee acting on the instruction of the Lord President has written to  the Treasuryinforming them that the way is now clear for direct negotiation with the Treasury by each of the Departments concerned with a  viewto a settlement of the necessary Establishments for these organ-isations and Stations so far as this may be necessary.3.   In the case of all the remaining Stations under review theSub-Committee unanimously agree       That some arrangement is desirable which will avoid over-       lapping In research and will ensure for each of the g       fighting services, in respect of any scientific research       it needs, the advantage of facilities available in the       government establishment, if any,  specially equipped for       such purposes; as regards Ridio Research  see paras.8/9.       That an arrangement of this nature should  provide for       co-operation with civil departments of the Government       interested in a section of research which  interests also       any of the Ear Departments; and       That where a research carried out in a Service Establish-       ment produces results of value to Industry,  these should b*       made available for British manufacturers  so far as this can       be done consistently with the safety of the realm.4*   the Sub-Committee believe, that an appropriate method ofco-ordinating research undertaken by different departments of thefighting services, and of co-operation in directing research ofcommon interest 1* twe or more departments would conduce to rapid-Hy in obtaining results and to considerable economy  in expenditure     They are also efiopinion that in so far 83 any researchundertaken at the instance of the fighting services is of civilianinterest it should be  financed by funds other than tfcase providedby Parliament for the  defence of the realm.   (In this connection it is to be noted that the Air  Ministry Vote  is in part inrespect of Civil Aviation).     It is moreover  desirable that in the  case of any resesrchthat may be expected  to  be of value  to  industry, contributionsshould as  far as possible be  obtained from the industries
 concerned.  The Sub-Committee bell ere  that these- cwntrlhTTtlona- can  be more properly  as well&apos; as iwre aaaily-^so^rareo&apos; by a civilian  departmioAt than by tho departments of  tho fighting   1* QBNSRAI CO-ORDINATION 01* RK&amp;ElARQH WORK HE QUIRED 5.    In the early days of the War It was  apparent that the axis ting  arrangements for research  and experiment in  tho flighting  Services were quite inadequate,  $his  led to irarried expansion, inprovisation and the creation of new establishments. These Research and Experimental Establishments  to a very  oon- siderable extent  worked independently  of  one another, and there was  no,real co-ordination between the  great Government Depart- menta as  a whole  in.matters  of research and experiment although.,,. attempts  were  made in this direction.  Before tho end of  the.war much had  been  done to seoure communication of information-as to- work in progress  and  results obtained, Within  the limits of some more or less self-contained fields,  much, advantage was gained by the  systematic appointment of Liaison Officers  and, less formally, by a natural  development which led to  various Committees becoming connected by an informal network  of members, each acting on two or more related  Committees..-6.   &apos; The  Sub-Committee are of opinion  that th&amp;  liaison arasange- merits which grow  up during the war, were  ultimately of definite value in  securing a certain  degree  of  eo-ordination and  oe- , operation.   In this  respect, arrangements of this kind should be continued.   Liaison, however, failed  to provide for  the systematic and comprehensive review of work required  to be- under taken for the common benefit of more than  one service,  the full interchange  of opinion  and knowledge between the several researoh  departments  of the  Service^ the  prevention of over- lapping of effort betweenService  and other scientific institutions,  the means for  bringing under a oommon control such work as is of con-man interest  either between the services themselves or  between the services  and industry and the                                                 provision *
 provision of funds for its  conduct, which  are  all necessary in any permanent organisation.      The organisation for research required  by the fighting services should make- effective  provision in these respects and it must do so  without in any  way  diminishing the responsibility of the Departments concerned tor  the administration and discipline of the  several Stations. Experiment has shown that the Departmental responsibility for a particular Station need not be  affected  although tha work done in the Station may come under  review in the manner suggested or although some  of it may  be  carried on under                 *                                          * the scientific direction and at the cost of  a  central body.! 7,   The tabulated statement of. Establishments which is annexed appendix) to this  Report gives  a  sufficient Indies- tion of their number and of their variety  of function to show at once that continuous survey and  the  due co-ordination of their work could not be  seoured either  by a Bystem of liaison officers dr by establishing for  each research Station a Joint Committee of the Departments  interested,  or  likely to be interested in its operations *   Liaison officers  could not be entrusted with the necessary responsibility and  in practioe individual officers rarely continue to function for sufficient periods to be cf full advantage in  a complex organisation.  The number of joint Committees  requiredi would be large and, even if these could  be set up.  they would be likely to obscure the responsibility of the maintaining Department while they would not provide  any  ready and effeo- tive means of attaining  the degree of co-ordination and co- operation which is desirable.
8.  In this connection the Sub-Committee have consideredthe arrangements which have already been made lor theestablishment of a &quot;Radio Reeearoh Board&quot; for the oe-ordination of scientific research in relation to  &quot;wireless&quot;comtounications.    The constitution of that Board and  theTerms of Reference to it are as follows:-(i)  Constitution.          Chairman - Admiral of the Fleet,  Sir Henry Jackson.          Members  - One representative each from the                     Admiralty, the War Office, the Air                     Ministry and the Post office (these                     representatives to be  nominated by                     their respective  apartments);                     Professor ?etavel and  Sir Ernest                     Rutherford with one other member  to be                     nominated by the Board itself after it                     has been appointed,(ii) Terms of Reference          (a)   To provide for interchange of information                between the various Government technical                Establishments concerning the special  work                which they undertake and the results achieved                so as to prevent duplication of work though                the Board should have no executive function                as regards the work cf these Establishments,          (b)   To arrange for the communication of                such information to interested                persons outside the Government service                when this can be done without detriment                to the public interest.          (.s)   In the case of researches net otherwise                adequately provided for te make tho                necessary arrangements to meet the                requirements of Government Departments                and others.9,  The Subcommittee have discussed the possibilitiesOf employing corresponding Boards to secure in other fieldsef Scientific Research the co-ordination and so-operation at whloh the Radio Research Board aims in relation te&quot;wireless&quot; communications.  They believe that the schemeof that Board lends itself to wider application and that Inthe first instance three such Boards should be formed todeal each with one part of the general field which concerns                                                   the
tho Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry - saywith the Science Groups which, for convenience, may be designated by their prominent sections, (a) Chemistry,(b) Physics and (c) Engineering.     The Beards should include representatives of each ofthe fighting services, of the Department.of scientific and Industrial Research, and. of any other Departments OfGovernment engaged to a material extent in research or pro-duct ion connected with the science group in cueation; with thesethere should be associated individual men of Science, experts inthe departments of research concerned.     Accordingly they unanimously recommend :-        (i)  that a Chemistry Research Board,  a Physics Research             Board and an Engineering Research Board             should now be established in  relation to             Research for tho Fighting Services in the three             subject groups,  Chemistry, Physics and Engineering,        (ii)  that the constitution and terms of reference             correspond, mutatis mutandis,  Ri&amp;h those             for the Radio Research  Board,      (iii)  that like that Board, these new Boards be             appointed by,  and  attached to, the Depart-             ment of Science  and Industrial Research.              -his Department,  would be  responsible for             the provision of the necessary funds for the              conduct of research in  pure Science and  in              those applications which  are  of civilian              as well  as military interest] it  would  alfae             be responsible  for securing contributions              from  industry in suitable cases,  and it  would              arrange for  the  co-operation  of Industrial     i         Research Associations where this  was appropriate.        (iv)   that  these Boards  should  be empowered  to              appoint  joint  Committees  for  the  direction              of work  in which two or more  Boards were              interested and  such Sub-Committees  as  might              be necessary. 10.  The  Committee recognise  that in the development of such a  system some  further  differentiation will  inevitably arise.      Thth If these  Boards had  existed last year the  newly constituted  Radio Research Board would have appeared  as a necessary offshoot from the  Physics Board.      Again  they note  that the  field  to  be                                                coveredrmQm
covered by the Engineering Board may be fo*und to be too large for a single B6ard; 1 oven.at the start, thefunctions of this Board-might have to be restricted  *                                &apos;         ...         *tt Mechanical Engineering, while&apos;Electrical Engineeringmight be taken, up under the Physios ;Board or jointlyunder both.  Further developments might&apos;call forfurther offshoot from the Engineering Board or for sub-division of function within that Board so that it oouldprovide adequately for speoial features of researchwithin its field.    1 The position of the proposod Reseamh Boards inrelation to the Department cf Scientific-and industrial research would enable them to ical directly, with questions involving arrangements to obtain for Govern-.ment work part-time services of professors and other experts working in University or&apos;private laboratories.It would afford them ready means for examining the necessities and the possibilities in the case ef such requirements as that which now faces the War office in respect cf the Chemical Warfare Establishment.11.   The Sub-Committee ha.ve not pursued the questionof hsw provision could best be made for  the physio-.logical rsfcoaxoiVwoTk required &quot;in connection withChemical Warfare *  They suggest that this should beconsidered in.relation to the Medical  Researoh Boardand that representatives of  the Medical Services ofthe fiavy and Army as well as of that Board, should&apos;beparties to the discussion cf. this relation.  They.note.however,  $hat&apos; in any case there must be  some - faoili-. ; ties&apos; for  Physiological work undter a scientific staff at Borton,  for the &quot;trials11;   They vouid otherwise be liable..to- almost-insuperable-difficulties,  feather conditions alone  introduce, enou^b to baffle  ordinary arrangements or the  occasional attendance of experts from a. distance for  this work.&quot;
      ii.  coteei. or SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS            Qvm&apos;ws&amp;&apos; rag m m m-12.  The Sub-Committee have given special attentionto those Institutions which undertake  rosearoh and expert-&apos;mental work for more than one of the Fighting Services,suoh as the Ordnance Committee, the Research  Department,Woolwich, the Experimental Establishment, Shoeburynese, and.the Admiralty Compass Department.  In  such oases  it  iB,oftoportano. to arrange so that the *orlc raquireft-Jy th.several departments can be carried out expeditiously with due regard to economy and to smooth working as between departments,     The Sub-Committee are of opinion  that steps  shouldbe taken to secure a proper co-ordination of  the  require-ments of the Departments co-operating  in the  maintenanceor in the use of these Institutions.   This turns mainly on the settlement of larger questions-^f policy and  ofthe priority to be assigned from time  to time to  theresearches suggested If one or other of theboneerned.   Whatever the means adopted for dealingwith the finance of such institutions  - and various alternatives are possible - no change  should  be made which would affeot the complete administrative responsi-bility of the Department to which any one of these institutions is attached.  For every such institution theactual control, both financial and administrative shouldbe entrusted to a single authority.     Questions of policy which Include both the rate andthe scale of progress in a research proposed  by a partiouldepartment have hitherto been matters of consultation
between responsible officers ef. the DeparttaejSTW winceraed,and eaoh of the co-opermiingr D*pe*rtments has in practicedirect access both to tho Institutions and to theirSuperintendents,  In the oaso of the Research Department,Woolwich and the Experimental Establishment. Shoeburynosa,the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry areeaoh represented on the Ordnance Committee which is responsible for preparing schemes for desired researches                           4which are passed to the Research Department9 Woolwich, orto the Bfcperimental Establishment, Shoeburyness forexecution.  The staffs of these two executive institutionsinclude both naval and military officers.     Useful aad neoessary as such links are, the Sub-Joamlttee are of opinion that provision should be made forsome more systematic review of broad questions of policyineluding that of priority in the schemes of particularresearches.   Moreover all general programmes of research and anymodificatioaas of these are conditioned by thefinancial provision amilable from time to. time withinIndividual. Departments.     $he constitution of the Ordnance Committee does notappear to the Sub-Committee to be suitable for the reviewof questions whioh thus arise and to impose such a dutyupon that Committee would Interfere with  the Importantfunctions it already exercises.  Similarly any joint&quot;Committee which might he set up  in relation to - say -the Admiralty Compass Department, or other establishmentsfor  joint use,  could not undertake functions of thiskln&amp;t   What appears to he needed is some regular andsystematic consultation between  the responsible members
of tho Board of Admiralty, Army Council and Air Councilrespectively, who would be fully acquainted with thepolicy of their respective departments.13*   The Sub-Committee therefore recommend that broadquestions of policy connected with the conduct of research and experiment in all establishments which serve the  needsof tho Fighting Services jointly, should be dealt with bya conference of the members of the Board of Admiralty, ArmyCouncil, and Air Council respectively who are responsiblefor Research, or their duly authorised representatives,  meeton such occasions as shall be mutually arranged;  and thatthis Conference Should arrange with the Maintaining depart-ments for the conduct and order of priority of suchresearches aad ijrvfrstigBfrecknB ;as may be agreed upon.      The general programme having thus been agreed,  itwould rest with the Maintaining Departments to carry outthe researches that are required.  At the same time,  theauthorise^representatives of the Departments concerned.should continue to have access to these establishments to observe the progress of work in which they are interested.
