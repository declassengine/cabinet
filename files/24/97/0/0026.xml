V.  Thio Document is the Property of,     ^   /?rri ...tV3a.iesty&apos;s Government          I circulate herewith to my colleaguea adraft of a Bill dealing with the law of propertywith a view to obtaining the authority of theGovernment to its introduction in the House of Lordsat the first available moment.          The,matters dealt with in the Bill are highly technical and I should not serve any useful purpose by discussing them at length.   They are dealtwith in as compact a form as is consistent with their nature in the memorandum prefixed to the Bill.          The Bill was prepared as a result of the deliberations of a very strong Committee presided overby Mr. Leslie Scott, K.C, M.P., assisted by a sub-committee on which all of the most eminent conveyancersin Lincoln&apos;s Inn took part.   Since it was drafted ithas been shown to Lord Haldane who has expressed his approval of it.  I am satisfied that it will, if passed into law, effect most beneficial changes in the law of english real property and greatly simplify the transferof land.                            (Sgd.)

FOURTH  REPORTOF THE&apos;ACQUISITION  AND  VALUATION  OF  LAND  COMMITTEEON THETRANSFER OF LAND  IN  ENGLAND AND  WALES.To the Right Honourable    LORD BIRKENHEAD,            Lord Chancellor,MY LORD,    In January, 1919, the Minister of Reconstruction (Dr. Addison) requested us to undertake the following enquiry:            &quot; To consider the present position of Land Transfer in England and Wales, and to        &quot; advise what  action should be taken to facilitate and cheapen the transfer of land.&quot;    In June last it was arranged, in view of the impending dissolution of the Ministry of Recon-struction, that, on the conclusion of our investigation  of  this subject,  we should  submit our report to  you.  Our enquiry  is now complete, and we have the honour to submit our Report.  .  The members of the Acquisition and Valuation of Land Committee  who have served onthis Committee are: Mr. Leslie Scott, K.C., M.P. (Chairman),  Mr.  A. S. Comyns Carr, Mr.Dixon H.  Davies,  Mr. George M. Freeman, K.C., Mr. Howard Martin, P.P.S.I., and Sir WilliamMiddlebrook, M.P.    The following additional members were appointed for  the  special purposes of this enquiry:Mr. James Bell, M.P., Mr. W. L. Hichens, Sir Tnomas  Ratcliffe-Ellis, Mr. A.  E. Russell, Sirand Mr. H. Wilson-Fox, M.P.  Mr. James Bell  found it impossible, owing  to pressure of otherengagements, to attend the meetings of the Committee, and resigned in April last.    2. We have held 18 meetings, and have considered the reports of other Committees on rele-vant subjects, and.various memoranda, both by members of the Committee  and from  other sources (including an illuminating essay by Major  J. W. Hills, M.P.).  We have  also  heardevidence  from   Sir  Charles  Fortescue-Brickdale  (the Registrar  of the Land  Registry),Colonel Sir Charles Close,  K.B.E.,  C.B., C.M.G. (the  Director-General of  Ordnance Survey),Mr. E. J. Harvey, M.A., Mr. L. D. Lewis (of Barclay&apos;s Bank, Ltd.) and Mr. T. P. Perks. We havehad the benefit of the constant advice and assistance of Mr. B. L. Cherry, and we cannot suffi-ciently express our indebtedness to his great knowledge and experience.    3. The facility and cheapness of any system of transfer of land on sale depend on the titlewhich a vendor of land is required to establish, and on the nature of the document which isrequired to transfer land to a purchaser.  In England and Wales, except where land is registered under the Land Transfer Acts, the owner&apos;s title, and the means by which his land can be con-veyed to a purchaser depend on the  law and practice of Conveyancing, and the existing law of real Property.  For the purpose of our Terms of Reference we have had, therefore, to considerthe law and practice of Conveyancing  and the existing law of Real Property.    We have considered it convenient to deal first with the law and practice of Conveyancing,by which we mean the methods of dealing with land other  than the methods applicable only toregistered land.
                                       PART  I.      The  Existing  Law  and Practice  of Conveyancing and  its  Proposed                                     Amendments.    4.  it is not necessary, for the purpose of this Report, to trace  the  evolution of modernConveyancing from the ancient  lormanties of &quot; feoffment with livery of seizing.&quot;  The proce-dure 01 submicudation in leuciai times, which was brought to an end by the Statute of yuiaEmptores in  1290, and the collusive  action known as a &quot; Common  Recovery,&quot; which wasabolished, in      have  long since ceased to complicate the title to land in  England andWales.   In  England,  writing was made a necessary part  of  all conveyances in the reign ofLharies 11.,,  and the loan 01  instruments  inter vivos  required  was largely  affected by tneStatute  ol  Uses, .and  later by  the invention of &quot;Lease and Release,&quot; unul the Real PropertyAct of  1845.   Ihis Statute also made a  deed necessary for a conveyance of land.    5.  Since the Act of  1845, many efforts have been made to simplify the practice of Con-veyancing in addition to statutes such  as the Settled Land Acts designed to facilitate thesale ol  settled land.   The chief  of these were the  Vendor and Purchaser Act of 1874, andthe Conveyancing  Act, 1881,  with its  amending Acts.  There  is no doubt  that these Actsgreatly  shortened the form of deeds, and removed  many of the difficulties and abuses whichrormeriy existed.    The Vendor and  Purchaser  Act,  1874, rendered investigation of title a less lengthy and complex procedure by  enacting (among other things) that 40 years should be substituted for60 years, as the period of commencement  of title which a purchaser  might require, in default of any stipulation to the contrary in the contract, and that under a contract to grant or  assigna term of years, in default of any stipulation to the contrary, the intending lessee or assigneeshould  not be entitled to call for the title to the freehold.  Phis latter principle was extended by the Conveyancing Act,  1881, to the  case of sub-leases,  by enacting that under  a contract to grant or  assign a sub-lease,  the intending sub-lessee or assignee, in default of any stipula-tion to the contrary, should not be entitled to call for the title to the leasehold  reversion.    The Conveyancing Act,  1881, materially altered and simplified the practice  of Convey-ancing,  mainly  by providing  that the  use  of certain  technical  words should  imply thecovenants for title which, prior  to the date of the Act, used to be set out in full in  a convey-ance.  and that a conveyance of  land or a manor, in  the absence of a  contrary intention, should include  the  rights and appurtenances  which prior to the date of the Act used to be specifiedin detail, and tfjat a mortgage,  in the  absence of a contrary intention, should  include powerto the mortgagee to sell  on default by the mortgager, and power for either the mortgager ormortgagee, when in possession, to grant leases and certain other powers which prior to the dateof the Act used to be set out in full in the mortgage deed.    6.  Notwithstanding  the much greater  degree of simplicity in Conveyancing effected bythe Statutes to which  we have referred, certain technicalities are still  necessary such  as theuse of  certain  &quot;words  of  limitation&quot;  to pass an  estate  in  fee simple,  documents arestill lengthened by reason  of the complexity of the law and the absence of powers which mightbe supplied  by Statute, and the  investigation of title is  still in many cases a lengthy technical and costly process.   On  a  sale of freehold land  in  England or Wales, the  purchaser mustsatisfy himself as to the vendor&apos;s title  (which, unless the vendor has protected himself by aspecial contract, involves the investigation of title for not less than 40 years) and the transaction-tion is completed by the  execution of a form of conveyance which must  still (if the purchaseris to obtain more than a life interest) convey the land in &quot;fee simple,&quot; or to the purchaser and&quot;his heirs.&quot;   The form  of mortgage of freehold Jand in general use still conveys the legal estate to the mortgagee with a &quot;proviso for redemption&quot; on payment of the principal money,with interest, on a date (generally six  months from  the date  of the deed) on  which neitherparty  to the transaction contemplates that the mortgage will  actually be paid off.    If the land in question is  the subject of a &quot;strict settlement,&quot; the purchaser must, inaddition, investigate the settlement or  settlements, and  satisfy himself  that the vendor is thetenant for life, which may necessitate evidence of pedigree, and must pay the purchase moneyto the trustees &quot; for the purposes of the Settled Land Acts.&quot;    If the land in question is leasehold, it will devolve on the  death of the owner in  a dif-ferent manner to freehold property, but no technical words are required to pass  a leaseholdinterest.    On the  sale of  copyhold land (except where the vendor sells under the Settled Land Acts),the vendor covenants to  surrender the  land into the  hands of the lord of the manor, and the transaction is completed by the surrender  to the use of the purchaser and his heirs and the subsequent admittance of the purchaser &quot;on payment of the customary fines and fees.  Amort-gage of copyhold land is effected by a conditional surrender accompanied by a collateral deedcontaining provisions for securing the  principal money  and interest and implying the  propercovenants for title.    In every case, except where the vendor is absolutely entitled  to  the  land  in question inpossession free from encumbrances, whether the land is freehold, copyhold or  leasehold, it isgenerally considered expedient that the deed of conveyance should  contain &quot;recitals&quot; for thepurpose of furnishing  evidence  and of showing the  exact interest of the vendor, and all other parties to the conveyance who are necessary to convey to the purchaser the interest in the land which he has contracted to buy.    It is thus apparent that while the Vendor and Purchaser Act and the Conveyancing Acts have undoubtedly had the effect of reducing the length and complexity of the deeds to be abstracted,
136THE TRANSFER OF UNREGISTERED LAND  STILL REMAINS A  HIGHLY TECHNICAL PROCESS, AND THE DRAFTING OF ACONVEYANCE STILL DEMANDS THE EXPERIENCE AND SKILL OF AN EXPERT.    7. WE HAVE CONSIDERED  IN  WHAT  RESPECTS  THE  EXISTING  PRACTICE  OF CONVEYANCING  CANBE FURTHER  IMPROVED ON THE TRADITIONAL  LINES LAID DOWN BY THE VENDOR AND PURCHASER ACT,  ANDTHE CONVEYANCING ACT WITH ITS AMENDING ACTS.   WE HAVE  ACCORDINGY MADE A SERIES OF RECOM-MENDATIONS, WHICH ARE EMBODIED  IN THE DRAFT LAW  OF  PROPERTY BILL, PREPARED BY MR.  CHERRY(PART III.), TO WHICH WE REFER LATER (SEE PARA. 24),  AND WHICH, FOR CONVENIENCE, WE REFER TO THROUGH-OUT THIS REPORT AS MR. CHERRY&apos;S LAW  OF PROPERTY BILL.    8. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE RELATES TO THE PERIOD OF COMMENCEMENT OF TITLE WHICH A PUR-CHASER MAY REQUIRE IN THE ABSENCE OF A STIPULATION IN THE CONTRACT TO THE CONTRARY.    THE AVERAGE PERIOD OF OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY IS A  GENERATION, OR, ROUGHLY, THIRTY YEARS,  ANDTO REDUCE THE LENGTH  OF TITLE TO LESS THAN THIS PERIOD WOULD REDUCE THE CHANCES OF COMMENCING the title WITH A CONVEYANCE ON SALE WHICH WOULD USUALLY DISCLOSE THE EXACT STATE OF THE TITLE AT  THATTIME.   UNDER THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS TIME DOES NOT BEGIN TO RUN AGAINST A  REVERSIONER ORREMAINDERMAN UNTIL  HE BECOMES  ENTITLED TO POSSESSION, SO THAT  THE PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED ABAD TITLE TO THE FEE FROM THE RIGHTFUL TENANT FOR LIFE COULD BE EJECTED BY THE TRUE REMAINDERMAN ONHIS ESTATE FALLING  INTO POSSESSION; AND ALTHOUGH, IN THE CASE OF AN ABSOLUTE OWNER, THE STATUTORYPERIOD FOR  BARRING AN ACTION TO RECOVER LAND IS NOW TWELVE YEARS, TIME DOES NOT COMMENCE TO RUNAGAINST A REVERSIONER OR REMAINDERMAN UNTIL HE BECOMES ENTITLED TO POSSESSION.   IT IS  OBVIOUS,THEREFORE, THAT EVEN  THE STATUTORY PERIOD OF 40 YEARS PRESCRIBED BY THE  VENDOR  AND PURCHASERACT,  1874, DOES  NOT PROVIDE  COMPLETE  PROTECTION  TO  A PURCHASER;   AND THIS PERIOD WAS ONLYCHOSEN AS AFFORDING A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT THE VENDOR HAD A GOOD TITLE.    THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE LAND TRANSFER ACTS* RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATUTORY period should BE  STILL FURTHER REDUCED TO 20  YEARS.  WITH THE OBJECT AIMED AT BY THIS REDUCTION WE AREIN SYMPATHY, BUT ON CONSIDERATION WE THINK THAT SO SHORT A PERIOD WOULD OCCASIONALLY INVOLVEMATERIAL RISK TO A PURCHASER.  WE ARE AWARE THAT,  AT THE  PRESENT DAY, PURCHASERS, ESPECIALLY IFDEALING WITH WILLING VENDORS,  READILY AGREE TO ACCEPT A 20 YEARS&apos; TITLE, UNLESS THEY ARE TRUSTEES or public DEPARTMENTS IN BOTH OF WHICH CASES A 40 YEARS&apos; TITLE IS ALMOST INVARIABLY INSISTED UPON.  BUTTHE FACT THAT WILLING  PURCHASERS MAY AGREE TO TAKE A CERTAIN  RISK IS NOT NECESSARILY A REASON  WHY(IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY STIPULATION TO  THE CONTRARY),  SUCH A RISK SHOULD BE FORCED  UPON  THEM by statute.  HOWEVER,  HAVING REGARD TO  THE EXISTING  PRACTICE OF WILLING- PURCHASERS, WE THINK  THATTHE STATUTORY PERIOD  MIGHT  PROPERLY BE REDUCED TO THIRTY YEARS.   BUT IT IS, IN OUR OPINION, ESSENTIALTHAT IF THIS IS DONE THE CHANGE SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A STATUTORY  ENACTMENT TO MAKE IT CLEARTHAT NO PURCHASER SHALL BE  DEEMED TO HAVE CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE OF EQUITIES WHICH  HE  WOULD HAVEDISCOVERED IF HE HAD INVESTIGATED  THE  TITLE PRIOR TO  THE  STATUTORY COMMENCEMENT OF TITLE.  IF this were NOT  DONE,  THE PRINCIPLE ESTABLISHED BV THE DECISION IN PATMAN V. HARLAND (17 CH.  DIV. 3153)THAT THE STATUTORY PROHIBITION IN  SECTION 2 (1) OF THE VENDOR AND PURCHASER ACT, 1874, AGAINSTTHE PURCHASER OF A LEASE CALLING FOR THE lessor&apos;S TITLE (IN THE ABSENCE OF exDress STIOVDATION TO THECONTRARY) DOES NOT  PROTECT HIM FROM LIABILITY FOR ENUITIES WHICH HE WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED IF THELESSOR&apos;s TITLE HAD  BEEN INVESTIGATED, SEEMS TO LEAD,  LOGICALLY,  TO  THE  CONCLUSION THAT A  STATUTORVPROHIBITION AGAINST CALLING; FOR A  TITLE LONGER THAN 20 YEARS, MIGHT EXOOSE A PURCHASER TO A SIMILARRISK.  INDEED, WE THINK THAT THE  DOCTRINE OF PATMAN V. HARLAND OUGHT TO BE REVERSED.     9. A FURTHER ALTERATION OF IMPORTANCE, WHICH WILL BE FOUND IN SECTION 24 OF MR. CHERR/S  law of PROPERTY BILL,  IS THAT THE CONVEYANCE OF FREEHOLD LAND TO ANY PERSON WITHOUT WORDS OF LIMITA-TION,  OR ANY EQUIVALENT EXPRESSION, SHALL PASS TO THE GRANTEE THE FEE  SIMPLE OR OTHER THE WHOLEINTEREST  WHICH THE  GRANTOR HAD POWER  TO CONVEY, UNLESS A CONTRARY INTENTION APPEARS IN THE CON-VEYANCE.   THIS PROVISION WILL OBVIATE THE NECESSITY OF CONVEYING LAND TO THE GRANTEE  &quot;AND HISHEIRS &quot; OR &quot; IN FEE SIMPLE&quot; TO WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED ABOVE, AND PREVENT  THE SERIOUS HARDSHIPSWHICH HAVE SOMETIMES OCCURRED BY THE ACCIDENTAL OMISSION TO INCLUDE THESE WORDS.      10.  ANOTHER IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION IS THAT  A RECEIPT  UNDER SEAL ENDORSED ON A MORT- GAGE FOR ALL  MONEY THEREBY SECURED, WHICH STATES  THE NAME OF  THE PERSON WHO PAYS THE MONEV, AND  IS EXECUTED  BY  THE PERSON IN WHOM THE MORTGAGE PROPERTY IS VESTED,  AND WHO IS LEGALLYENTITLED TO GIVE A RECEIPT FOR  THE MORTGAGE MONEY, SHALL OPERATE, WITHOUT ANY  RE-CONVEYANCE, RE-ASSIGNMENT, SURRENDER OR RELEASE^ AS A DISCHARGE OF THE MORTGAGED PROOERTY  FROM ALL CLAIMS UNDER THE MORTGAGE.  THIS IS ONLY APPLYING TO MORTGAGES IN GENERAL, WITH MODIFICATIONS, THE PROVISIONS ALREADY  AUTHORISED BY  THE  BUILDING SOCIETIES ACT,  1874, SECTION 42, IN THE CASE OF MORTGAGES TO BUILDING SOCIETIES.  BUT IT IS TO B*  noted THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT SUCH A RECEIPT SHOULD BE LIABLE TO  THE SAME  STAMP DUTY AS IF IT  WERE A RE-CONVEVANCE,  WHEREAS RECEIPTS GIVEN UNDER THE BUILDING SOCIETIES ACT,  1874, ARE FREE FROM stamD DUTY.   THIS IS  A REFORM WHICH HAS LONG  BEEN ADVOCATED, AND  WILL OBVIATE THE NECESSITY AND COST OF a DEED OF RE-CONVEYANCE.      A REFORM OF a  SOMEWHAT SIMILAR NATURE IS CONTAINED IN SECTION 70 OF MR. CHERRV&apos;S  LAW OF PROPERTY  BILL,, WHICH MATERIALLY SHORTENS DEEDS OF TRANSFER OF MORTGAGE BY PROVIDING- THAT A DEED  PURPORTING-  TO TRANSFER THE  BENEFIT OF A MORTGAGE SHALL OPERATE TO TRANSFER TO THE TRANS- FEREE ALL THE SECURITIES, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE MORTGAGEE UNDER THE  ORIGINAL  MORTGAGE WHICH ARE AT PRESENT SET OUT IN FULL.      11. WE HAVE  CONSIDERED THE BEST METHOD OF DEALING WITH RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WHICH CON- TINUE TO BIND LAND AFTER THEY HAVE  BECOME OBSOLETE.    AS WE STATED  IN OUR SECOND REPORT&apos;    *Cd. 5483.    t We think that this Recommendation should apply not only to the general law as between vendor  and purchaser,  but also to the length of the  title to be shown for registration with  an Absolute Title,      Cd. 9229.
 (para. 22), &quot;this question is one of considerable importance, as a  large  amount of land is &quot;bound by restrictive covenants.  In many cases such covenants were originally  imposed for &quot; the protection of vendors who have long since ceased to have any interest in enforcing such &quot;covenants,, and in other cases land is bound by covenants which were originally designed to &quot;ensure that the neighbourhood should continue to enjoy a residential or other special character, &quot;and such covenants continue to be in force long after the neighbourhood has ceased to enjoy &quot;the special character, to preserve which  the covenants were imposed.  In some such cases the &quot;covenants are, no doubt, ignored, but in  others the owners of the land which is subject to such &quot;restriction are in doubt  as to their position, and  are  debarred from making the fullest use &quot;of their property, or are compelled to purchase the release of the covenants.&quot;     It is, in our view, very desirable that there should be  a power  vested  in  an  appropriate authority,  on the application of  any  person  interested  in any land affected by any restriction arising under covenant or otherwise, by order to discharge or modify any  such restriction,  on beine- satisfied that the restriction  ought to  be deemed obsolete, or that its continued existence would impede the reasonable user of the land for public or private purposes, or that the persons of full age and capacity entitled to the benefit of the restriction  have  agreed  expressly  or impliedly to the restriction being discharged or modified, subject to  payment of compensation to the persons entitled to the benefit of such restrictions, if such persons are, in fact, damaged by the  discharge or modification of such restrictions.     There are some  grounds  for  thinking,  as was recommended by the Royal Commission on the Land Transfer Acts, that the authority to exercise such a power should be the Court.  But, in our opinion, questions of policy rather than of law would often be involved in the  considera- tion  of  such  a proposal, and for this reason we do not regard a Court as the most suitable authority.  It is not for judges  either  to make new contracts  for parties, or to invent new rules of public policy.     In paragraph 22 of our Second Report  above quoted, we advised that  the  modification or extinction  of restrictive covenants should be  entrusted  to the  Sanctioning  Authority recom- mended  in our First  Report.*   To that advice we still adhere, and  trust that steps may  be taken to set up the Sanctioning Authority  there recommended.  But, in the meantime, we think that jurisdiction to extinguish or modify restrictive covenants, and  to  assess compensation  (if any) in connection therewith should be entrusted- to  the  official arbitrators appointed  under the Acquisition of  Land (Assessment of Compensation)  Act,  1919.   This recommendation is em- bodied in Section 86 or Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill.     12. In certain districts of England and  Wales, the title to land is greatly  complicated by the existence of chief rents, or  perpetual rent charges.  Chief rents are particularly common in the North of England, where they form the principal method of financing building  opera- tions, and  are a favourite  form of investment.  The same piece of land may be  subject to more than one chief  rent, which remains a permanent encumbrance on the title to land.  The creation of chief rents constitutes a bar to the complete simplicity of the title to the land which is subject to them ;  but although the object we  have  in view, which is the simplification of the title to land, would be advanced by the abolition of the system of chief rents, we do not feel justified, for that reason only, in recommending the abolition of a procedure which serves a definite economic pur- pose, is well understood in the districts where it is practised, and forms an  attractive source of investment, especially to small investors.  Section 45 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881, provides a procedure for the redemption of quit rents, and other perpetual charges, and we have confined ourselves  to recommending the enlargement  of the operation of that section, chiefly by making that section applicable to rents reserved on sale, and rents made payable under a grant or license for building purposes,  which were excluded from the operation of that section, and also to com- pensation rent charges payable to the lord of the manor as compensation for the extinguishment of manorial incidents.   We also propose to  add a power to the Board of Agriculture (who now exercise  the functions  formerly vested by  Section  45 of the Conveyancing  Act,  1881, in the Copyhold Commissioners) to apportion such a rent  in. cases where  it is desired to discharge a part only of the land subject to such a rent.  Our recommendations will be  found in full  in Section 88 of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill.     13. We   also recommend  the  adoption of minor amendments of the Conveyancing Acts which are contained in Part III. of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill.  These  minor  amend- ments relate to the abolition of acknowledgments by married women, the acquisition and dis- position of trust estates by married women, the substitution of registration for enrolment of dis- entailing assurances, a provision requiring powers of attorney dealing with land to be filed, a provision  enabling a  power  of  attorney  for valuable consideration to  be given  to  the purchaser  of  a  property  and  the  persons  deriving title  under  him,  provisions   as to the creation  of rent charges, and  an  amendment of  Section  65 of the  Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1881 (which deals with the enlargement of a long term into the fee simple), These amendments of details are in themselves of considerable importance, and will improve the existing system of conveyancing and assist  its operation;  but we do not consider it necessary to refer to them in greater detail in the body of  our Report.     14. Part III.  of Mr.  Cherry&apos;s  Law of Property Bill also contains provisions for the  main- ten ance of infants  entitled contingently  on attaining full age,   and  provisions for removing- doubts as to the rules of law relating to perpetuities, and power for the lord of a manor, or thetenant, to acquire the interest of the other in minerals under enfranchised copyhold land. This latter                                     l    *Cd. 8998.
provision provides a remedy for a cause which, as we pointed out in our Third Report/ frequentlyresults in a loss of minerals to the  nation, as, under the existing- law, neither the lord of the manornor the tenant, can work such minerals without the consent  of  the other.  In our opinion, allthese latter amendments are desirable, but as they do  not  directly  affect the transfer of land,they do not come within our  terms of reference, and must, therefore, be regarded as incidental to the main purpose of our enquiry, and be judged on their  merits.     15.  The operation of the existing system of Conveyancing depends not only on the Statutesto which we have referred, but also on the customs and methods adopted in the actual practiceof Conveyancing.     The objection generally made by laymen to the existing system of Conveyancing is  that itis slow and costly, and this criticism is directed not  only against  the law,  but also  against  thepractice of Conveyancing.     16.  So far as the accusation of delay is concerned, it is true that a period elapses betweenthe time when a contract for sale is signed, and the date at which the sale is actually completed.This period may vary from a fortnight, or even less, in the case of a  small and simple transaction,to as much as three months or more in the case of the transfer of  a large estate.  It is sometimesassumed that this period is unnecessary, and could  be avoided;  but we think it is often over-looked that, even if the system of  conveyancing permitted  the investigation of title  and com-pletion of the purchase to take place within a shorter period,  there  are few cases in which  theperiod would in practice be reduced.  It must be remembered that  a vendor has, in many cases,to find a fresh residence into which he may move, or has to arrange for the sale or the removalof furniture.  The purchaser  has, in most cases, to realise investments to provide  the purchase money, and there are, in many cases, valuations of timber  stock or fixtures to be made.   Thereis also the fact that, as a matter of convenience, completions  are frequently fixed to take place on one of the usual quarter days, so as to render arrangements with lessees and  tenants easier,  and facilitate the apportionment of income and outgoings.     17.  In regard to the accusation of costliness, we think it only  right  to say clearly that  thescale of costs allowed by the  Solicitors&apos; Remuneration Order, 1881,  cannot be considered  at allexcessive  in  view of the work which has to be  performed,  even  on  the value of   money which obtained in 1881.  We are assured that the scale allowed for small transactions does  notremunerate the solicitors employed.  The scale commences at  3,  though the work involved ina small purchase may be exactly the same as that  in a purchase involving a larger sum.  It isalso pointed out that  the scale for transfers exceeding  100,000 is  the same as for transactionsinvolving that figure, so that in the largest transactions  solicitors do  not  reap  any  additionaladvantage from the money which passes.  We see  no reason  why this limit should be imposed-!     18.  In our opinion, the recommendations which we have made in this part of our Report  willconsiderably  improve the existing practice of conveyancing, in matters of detail, and we recom-mend that they should be adopted.   We realise, however, that  the adoption of  these  recom-mendations will not entirely achieve the object we have in view, which is to facilitate and cheapenthe transfer of land.   Their adoption will, in our opinon, bring   the  existing  system  of Con-veyancing to  as high  a pitch of perfection as, so far  as we can foresee, it is ever likely to attain.But even if our recommendations are adopted, the existing  system would retain  some  of  the defects to which we  have called attention in the earlier part of this Report (para. 6).  It appearsto us that.if  these Recommendations are carried into law, a limit will then have been reached inthe improvements which can  be effected along the traditional lines of development laid down bythe Conveyancing Acts, and that if a more perfect system of land transfer is to be achieved, a far more drastic  reform will have to be effected than is  contained  in the  Recommendations  whichwe have enumerated above.    During our enquiry we became convinced that the main defects in the  existing system ofConveyancing do not lie either in the Conveyancing Acts or in the practice of Conveyancing,but in the general law of Real Property.  We accordingly proceeded to consider the Law of real property, with the object of ascertaining to what extent  an amendment in the general  law of real Property would simplify the transfer of land.                                        PART  II.        The Existing Law of Real Property and its Proposed Amendments.    19.  When we considered  the  existing law of Real  Property, we were  supplied  by  Mr.Arthur Underhill with a pamphlet, which was written by him before he became a member of thisCommittee, the first part of which so admirably sets  out in untechnical language the growth ofthe law of Real  Property  in England and Wales,  that  we   have  reprinted it as the FirstAppendix to this  Report.   *Cd.  156.   fOur attention has  been drawn to  the fact that conditions of  sale by auction in the West of Englandsometimes require the purchaser to employ the  vendor&apos;s solicitor and  to pay his charges.   This  practiceappears to us to be indefensible, and we are of opinion that it should  be prohibited  by law.  This  recom-mendation is embodied in Section 95 of  Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law  of Property Bill.    8707              -                                                              1!
    Mr. UnderhilPs pamphlet clearly demonstrates that, in spite of such Acts as the Settled LandActs of 1882-90,  which have freed settled land from some of the shackles imposed  by previousgenerations, the existing law  of Real  Property is still  based on a system  which is no  longerapplicable to the needs of to-day, and which is so complex that the transfer of land can only safely be dealt with by an expert in this branch of law. The existence of  special  tenures, such as copy-holds, and special customs, such as Gavelkind and Borough  English, also  unnecessarily compli-cate the system of land tenure.    20.  For many  years it has been argued that the true principle of reform in the system  of transfer of land is to amend and improve the general  law  of  Real  Property,  and  with  thisobject, Bills to amend the law of Real Property and the  Settled  Land Acts,  and to abolishpeculiar or local customs, and copyhold and other customary tenures, have from time to  time beenpromoted, e.g., the late Mr. Wolstenholme&apos;s Bill to simplify the title to and transfer  of land, andthe late Mr. Sweefs and Mr. Cyprian Williams&apos; Bills for the Assimilation of the Law of real property to that  of Personal Property, and Lord Haldane&apos;s  Real  Property and  ConveyancingBill of 1915. -    Reform on these lines is  referred  to in the Report of the  Royal Commission on  the LandTransfer Acts, but,  inasmuch as the Commissioners were restricted by the terms of their referenceto consider and report upon the working of the Land Transfer Acts, and whether  any amend-ments were desirable, they were unable to  do more  than express an  opinion on these proposals in so  far as they would be of assistance to the registration of  title.                                                    w    21.  At an early stage of our proceedings, Mr.  Arthur  Underbill  (Senior  ConveyancingCounsel of the Court) laid before us the scheme for assimilating the law of Real  Property  tothat of Personal Property, and amending the practice of Conveyancing, which  is set  out in hispamphlet  contained in the First Appendix to this Report.  After consideration  of this proposal,and of the other  Bills for the amendment  of the law of Real  Property and Conveyancing  towhich we have referred, we remitted to a sub-Committee, consisting of  Mr.  Underbill, Mr. A.  E.Russell, Sir Claud Schuster, K.C., C.V.O., Mr. Alfred Topham and Sir Walter Trower, for detailed consideration and criticism, both Mr. UnderhilPs proposal and the following Bills, which embodiedsome  of  the most recent proposals for reform  in the law of Real Property,* viz. :-         1. The Copyhold and Special Tenures Bill prepared  by  Mr. Cherry (one  of the Con-    veyancing Counsel of the  Court)  and  Sir  F. F. Liddell,  K.C.B.  (First  Parliamentary    Counsel).         2. The Renewable Leaseholds Conversion Bill, prepared by Mr. Cherry.         3. The Intestacy  Bill, prepared by the late Mr. Sweet (one of the Conveyancing Coun-    sel of the Court).         4. The Trustee Bill, prepared by Mr. Cherry and Mr.  A.  E. Russell (one  of the Con-    veyancing Counsel of the Court).         5.  The Settled Lands Acts Amendment Bill, prepared  by the two last mentioned gentle-    men.    The  Sub-Committee also had the advantage of close co-operation with the late Mr. Sweet,Mr. B. L. Cherry and Mr. J. E. H. Benn (one of the Conveyancing Counsel  to the Court).  TheSub-Committee presented  a preliminary report to us in March, 1919.    22. Our Sub-Committee, in  their preliminary  report, after detailed  criticism  of  these fiveBills  and of Mr. UnderhilPs  proposal, reported that, if Mr. UnderhilPs  main principle shouldbe approved by us, then it would be better to amalgamate the  five Bills  referred to  and (Mr.UnderhilPs proposal, together with certain other Bills in contemplation, into  one Bill, the primary object of which should be  to give to freeholds and copyholds all the incidents of  chattels real,and to amend the law of intestacy, subject to the1 other Bills being treated as ancillary to the mainscheme.   We therefore further  considered Mr.  UnderhilPs  proposal.  Mr. UnderhilPs proposal as stated by him  in his pamphlet is, shortly          1. To abolish all the complexities and incidents of two of the three collateral  systems     of holding land, viz., the freehold and copyhold tenures, and to enact (in effect) that hence-     forth all land  now held as freehold or copyhold shall have precisely the same legal incidents     as if it were leasehold land holden for a term of, say, 100,000 years at a peppercorn rent.         2. To free purchasers from the present onus of investigating trusts; and         3. Finally, to treat tenancy in commdn (which, after  all,  is, in effect, a settlement  for     concurrent instead of for  successive interests) in much the same way as Parliament  has treated     settled estates, viz., by giving to some person, or a  limited  number  of  persons,  all  the     powers conferred by the  Settled Land Acts on a tenant for life.t     23.  After full consideration of the  proposals contained in Mr. UnderhilPs  Pamphlet,and of the Preliminary Report of our Sub-Committee, we  agreed unanimously that the exist- ing law of Real  Property is  archaic and  unnecessarily complicated, that no great improve-ment in the existing systems of transfer of land, whether registered or unregistered, can beeffected until the law of Real Property has been radically simplified,  and lastly that,  as it is   * We did not at  this stage remit to this Sub-Committee the consideration of Lord Haldane&apos;s Real Pro-perty and Conveyancing Bill, which we reserved for consideration  by ourselves.     This proposal was subsequently modified, and in Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property BilJ it is provided that land, subject to tenancies in common, shall be vested in trustees for.sale.
obviously impossible to repeal the whole of the existing law of Real Property and to impose anew Code, Mr. Underhill&apos;s proposal (with the amendments proposed by  our Sub-Committee)offers the best and simplest remedy to effect the required simplification with as little disturb-ance as possible.  We therefore decided to adopt the recommendation  of our Sub-Committee,and to request Mr.  Cherry to prepare  a Bill on the  lines indicated by  Mr.  Underhill, whichshould also include  the  further amendments of the&apos; law of Real Property contained in  the fiveBills above referred to, and the other amendments referred to by our Sub-Committee.    24.  Mr. Cherry, accordingly,  prepared  a Law  of  Property Bill,  which we have  considered.In connection with this Bill, we have also considered  the Real  Property and Conveyancing bill introduced by Lord Haldane in 1915. The latter Bill  crystallised many of  the  reforms in thelaw of Real Property and Conveyancing, which were  at  that  time  strongly  advocated,  and,though we have proceeded on a somewhat different general scheme, which we believe will attainour object without the complexities inherent in that Bill, we have  adopted in principle many  ofthe proposals embodied in it, and desire to record our deep indebtedness to its authors.   In fact,without the aid of that Bill  the present  Bill  would not  have been prepared  within the time at our disposal.    The main principles of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill may be stated broadly to be:          (a) To assimilate the law of freeholds and  copyholds to that of leaseholds by enacting,    first, that copyholds shall be compulsorily enfranchised, and  have  the same incidents  as free-    hold land;  and  secondly, that freehold land, including copyholds enfranchised by virtue  of    the  Bill,  and also customary  freeholds, including land subject to special customs, shall have    all the incidents of a chattel real estate held for  a term  of years  certain,  save that  such    estates shall continue in perpetuity  and  be called freehold estates in fee simple.   By this    means a unification of the law will be secured, the  equitable rules in regard to conversion as    between heirs and next-of-kin will be rendered  obsolete,  and the  administration of assets    on death will be simplified.  Further, this provision will enable the  Statute  of  Uses to  be    repealed.         (b) To provide that the only estates, interests or charges which, after the Bill becomes    operative, shall be subsisting or capable of being created at  law, shall consist of-            (i) an estate in freehold land in fee simple;            (ii) a term&apos; of years absolute ;           (iii) a like estate or term in mines and  minerals apart  from  the  surface, or  in the      surface apart  from the  mines and minerals;           (iv) a perpetual  rent charge  in possession or reversion;           (v) a rent charge held for a term of years absolute ;           (vi) an easement, right or privilege  in or over land for an  interest equivalent to a like      estate or term;           (vii)  any charge secured by  a legal term of years absolute.    Such estates will be legal estates, and all other estates, interests  and charges will take effect    in equity only, and will be known as equitable interests.         (c) To place all interests in land except legal estates in  fee simple, or for a  term  of    years  absolute,  behind  a curtain consisting of either a trust for sale or a settlement/ and    at the same time to abolish the equitable doctrine of notice of  trusts, so that a bona fide    purchaser for value shall not be bound or concerned to investigate a trust, but  shall  be    entitled to ^ssume that the vendor has full power to carry  out the transaction, and  that the    Settled Land Act Trustees or  Trustees for sale  can give  a good receipt for the purchase    money, unless the vendor is absolutely entitled when the money would be paid to him.         (d) To prohibit a. mortgage of the fee simple by conveyance of the fee simple, to con-    vert existing fee simple mortgages into long  term  mortgages, and  to  provide that  a mort-    gage  shall  be  effected by  the  creation  of a  ]ong term  of years.   By this  method    the  legal  fee  simple  will  be   left in  the   mortgagor,  subject  to   a  legal  term    of  years in  the mortgagee.  Second and subsequent   mortgages will  be  created by    further  legal   terms  of years,   and  will   be  legal    mortgages   instead   of   purely    equitable securities.  On foreclosure or sale,  the mortgage term will be  automatically    converted into  the  fee simple.  This method of creating mortgages,  with provisions for    getting in bare legal estates, has  enabled the Bill  to  be drafted  in  terms  which  are    familiar to  all lawyers, and has avoided the necessity of  introducing  a  new phraseology    such  as was inevitable in Lord Haldane&apos;s Real Property and Conveyancing Bill.         (e) To provide that the  entirety of land held under a tenancy in common  shall  be    vested in trustees for sale, with whom a purchaser will be enabled to deal without investi-    gating the title  to the shares.   No undivided share will be  capable of being created, except    by a settlement, and then it will  be made to take effect behind a  trust for sale in respect    of the proceeds of the  sale of the  land, and of the rents and profits  until sale. This pro-    vision will  enable the Partition Acts to be  repealed, and will  effect  great simplification    and saving of costs.         (f) To provide, in regard  to land comprised in  a settlement, that the entire fee simple    or term of  years, which  is the subject  of a  settlement,  shall be vested in the tenant for    life of full age or other statutory owner having the power  of a  tenant for life,  and on his    * It is proposed that the number of Settled Land Act Trustees and  of Trustees for sale should be re-restricted to  four, so that the saleability of land shall not be impeded by an undue number of Trustees. Alsothat capital moneys shall be paid to at least  two  Trustees, except where the  Trustee is a  corporation.  Inthis way the equitable  interests will be properly protected without the registration of  cautions or inhibitions.    8707                                                                             B2
    death shall devolve upon his personal representatives, who shall convey the settled land by    vesting  assent  to  the  next  tenant   for  life  of  full  age,  or  the  statutory  owner,    who  has the  powers  of  a  tenant  for life,  or  the   person  who  may  be  absolutely    entitled  thereto.    In  order  to  safeguard  the  interests  of  the  successors  of  the    tenant  for  life, it   is  provided  that  the  instrument  vesting  the   property  in  the    tenant for life shall contain a statement of the persons who are trustees for the purposes    of  the  Settled Land Acts,  and this  statement will intimate to  purchasers and others that    the ostensible legal  owner is, in fact,  a trustee whose  powers are limited to those con-    ferred by the Settled Land Acts as extended (if at all)  by the instrument in question. The   &apos; settlement itself will be kept off the title, and  all that a purchaser will be bound to do will    be to satisfy himself that the proposed transaction falls within  the statutory powers of a    tenant for life,  as extended (if at  all) by the instrument vesting  the property in the vendor,         the tenant  for life, and that  the purchase money is paid to the trustees for the pur-    poses of the Settled Land Acts.    25. These are the essential  principles  of the Bill, and in the words of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Memo-randum contained in the Fourth Appendix, their effect is that &quot;&apos; the reforms sought in Lord&quot; Haldane&apos;s Bill of 1915 are, with insignificant exceptions,  carried out  without the complica-&quot; tions incidental to  that scheme, without inventing  any new nomenclature, and without setting&quot;up a register of cautions and inhibitions.&quot;    26. The assimilation of the law of copyholds and freeholds to that of leaseholds, whileessential for the main object that we have in view,  will, if the law  of leaseholds remains un-amended, involve certain consequences in regard to estates tail  and  devolution  on  intestacywhich will hardly  satisfy modern ideas.  If estates  tail are  to be retained (and no doubt theywill be useful in practice), we think that the same law should be made  applicable to personalty asto realty, but that they  should not affect the title to the legal estate, and the Bill accordinglyprovides that estates tail or  entailed  interests may be created in regard to personal estate aswell as real estate, but only in equity, so that they will take effect behind the curtain of a trustfor sale, or a settlement, and will not in any way complicate the title to land.    In regard to devolution on intestacy, the Bill contains in Part VIII. certain provisions basedon our recommendations.  The principle which we  have followed is that real and personal estateshould devolve together, so that the difficulties which arise at present, owing to property devolv-ing in  different ways, may be avoided.  We have also proposed that a wife whose husband diesintestate shall have  the  same rights in her husband&apos;s property as a husband has if his wife diesintestate; and that a mother (1) shall share equally with  a father if her child dies intestate,without leaving a spouse or issue, and (2) if she is the  surviving parent, shall take in preference to the brothers and sisters of her deceased child.    The provisions of the Bill  which relate to estates  tail and devolution  on intestacy are not essential to the main purpose of our enquiry, and must be regarded  as  incidental,  and judgedupon their merits,  except that,  in our opinion, it is essential that, whatever is done, there shouldbe no distinction in the  devolution of, and methods of dealing with, real &apos;or personal estate.    27.  The Bill  also includes the amendments of the Law and Practice of Conveyancing towhich we have referred in Part I. of this Report, and the  amendments  of the  Land TransferActs,  to  which we refer  later in Parts IV. and VII.  of this Report, and also certain amend-ments of the Settled Land Acts and the Trustee Act, 1893, and a reform as to renewable lease-holds, which are  proposed  by the Bills referred to our Sub-Committee.    Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill has, from time to time, been  revised in accordance withsuggestions and criticisms made by our Sub-Committee and recommendations made by ourselves.In October, 1919, our Sub-Committee presented to us a final report,  which we  have printed asthe Second Appendix to this Report.  In  this Report our  Sub-Committee stated that Mr.Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill  carried  out the principle of Mr.  Underbill&apos;s  proposals and recom-mended that it should be adopted in its entirety.    Mr. Cherry has prepared a memorandum explaining the  principles and objects  of his law of Property Bill, which we have appended as the Fourth Appendix to this  Report in lieu of theBill itself,  which  is  necessarily Jong.  This  memorandum renders it unnecessary for  us toexplain the principles of  the Bill  at greater length in this part of our Report.    28. In view of the Terms  of our Reference, we  do not feel it to be within our province toexpress any opinion on the amendments of  the Law of Real Property contained in Mr. Cherry&apos;sLaw of Property Bill, except in so far as they affect the transfer of land ; but in so far as theseproposals  do affect the transfer of land, we  are satisfied not only that they will affect an im-provement in the Law of Real Property and Conveyancing, but that they are absolutely neces-sary to achieve the object we have in view, which  is to cheapen and facilitate the transfer ofland.  We are aware that some of the  proposals contained in the Bill (such as the provisions asto the devolution of land on the death of an owner intestate)  only incidentally affect the transferof land; but we believe that it is impossible to sever  such  proposals from the remainder, andthat the scheme must be  considered as a whole.    Not only will the benefits of the scheme embodied in Mr.  Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Billaccrue to  unregistered land, but, as we show later, the scheme will materially simplify and per-fect  Registration  of Title.  We are, moreover, of  opinion that the Bill  should be made lawwhatever may be decided as to extending the system of compulsory registration, as, even if com-pulsory registration  is eventually extended  to the whole country, a considerable period must
necessarily elapse before all land in the country is included, and during this period the effect ofthe Bill would be most beneficial.  We conclude this portion of our Report with a unanimousrecommendation that the amendments in the Law of  Real  Property  and  Conveyancingembodied in  Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill should be passed into  law at  the  earliestpossible date.PART  III.The  Effect  of  the  Proposed  Amendments  in the  Law  of  Real Property  on            the Existing System  of  Transfer of  Unregistered  Land.    29. At this point it is desirable to consider  broadly  the effect of  Mr.  Cherry&apos;s  Law  ofProperty Bill on dealings with unregistered land.    Without entering into  the details set out in the Fourth Appendix  to  this Report, it  isobvious that the Bill has an immediate  effect in regard to the clearing of complicated titles,but the full effect of the abolition of technicalities can only be  felt  after the Bill has been inforce  some time.  The specimen abstracts  contained in the 8th Schedule to the Bill illustrate the change which will have been effected.  A person investigating the Title will only be con-cerned with the  legal estate in fee simple or for a term of years. The title cannot be lengthenedand complicated by the existence of undivided shares in the same land.   There will no longer be any copyholds  or customary tenures.  If  a proprietor dies intestate, the title cannot  be complicated by the existence  of special  customs,  or  by the difference which  at present exists between the devolution of the real and personal  estate  of an intestate.   A settlement  of land will no longer give rise  to complications of the title, for a purchaser will not have to investi-gate  the  settlement  or  will   creating  the  beneficial  interests, but will  be able  to  dealsafely with a  certified   owner and  pay  the  money  to  certified  trustees.   The  titlewill,  in fact, consist of transfers of  the fee simple from one  proprietor to  another, subject in some cases  to leases and mortgages  secured by terms of years.  On  a death the land willdevolve to the legal personal representatives of the deceased proprietor.   Throughout the Billwomen have been treated on the same  footing as&apos;men.  Infants will no  longer take any legal estate in land,  but during  minorities the land will be vested, either in personal representatives,or in  Settled Land Act Trustees, who  will have all the necessary powers of management.    Documents  of title will be considerably shortened and simplified.   Most of  the recitalswhich are now necessary to show the title of the parties to a deed will be unnecessary.   In fact,documents will  be  reduced to  the  shortest length compatible with recording the parties to the transaction, the nature of the transaction,  the consideration therefor, and a description of theland  affected.   The abolition of the need for words of limitation will also render documents of title easier to comprehend  and less  liable to error.   Such documents will be intelligible to every educated  man, and though it will hardly be  safe for  anyone but a lawyer to preparedocuments of  title, it will be  possible for  business men to ascertain the effect of documents of title with much greater certainty than can be said to be the case  at present    30.  The investigation of title  will still involve the exercise  of skill and knowledge, but less technical knowledge than is at present needed will be required.    The  time  and labouroccupied will be considerably less,  partly because of the tendency to reduce the length of title to be  proved, and  partly because of the greater  simplicity of the documents themselves,, but,in the main, because of the absence of any documents  except those  dealing with legal estatesin the land.  The simplification of title effected by this Bill will be achieved by  fundament-ally different methods to those employed by the Conveyancing Act,  1881,  and the effect willbe very much greater.    We proceeded next to consider the alternative system of Registration of Title to land asit&apos;at  present exists in the  City and County of  London, and the amendments which can bemade to improve  that system.PART   IV.The  Existing  System  of Registration  of Title  and  its  Proposed Amendments.    31. The Report of the Royal Commission on the Land Transfer Acts contains in ChapterII. a descriptive and historical survey of the system of Registration of Title established by theLand Transfer Acts, and its development, which is  so comprehensive that it is unnecessary tocover the same ground in this Report.    The Royal Commission proceeded to  investigate the working of the Land  Transfer  Acts,and to make  recommendations for the  amendment of the system.                 ,
    ,We have carefully considered these  recommendations in detail.  To some extent our recom- mendations are based on evidence which was adduced  before the  Royal Commission;  but in some respects the period which has elapsed since the Report of the Royal Commission has dis- closed developments which were not then so apparent, and for other reasons we do  not concur in every respect with the recommendations of the Royal Commission.  For convenience, we have reprinted in the Third Appendix to this Report the Summary of Recommendations of the Royal Commission  included in paragraph  104 of their Report.     32. We concur with  Recommendations Nos. 3, 11, 15, 16,17, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30 and 31. These  Recommendations,  together  with  the  amendments of the remaining recommendations which we note below,  have been incorporated in Part  X. of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill. With regard to  the remaining recommendations of the Royal Commission, we submit the follow- ing amendments.  For convenience, we have reprinted in italics each of these recommendations in the order in which v/e discuss them. RECOMMENDATION No. 1.         &quot;Registration with  Absolute Title to confer  on  the registered proprietor as well as     &quot;on his transferees a title not defeasible in consequence of defects in  the  title  prior to     &quot; registration, but subject in  the case of the proprietor and  transferees from him  other-     &quot;zvise than for value to all rights  created by the  proprietor  himself.&quot;     We concur in this Recommendation,  but we think it should be made clear that this Recom- mendation is subject to our amendments to Recommendations Nos. 18 and 19 as to the rectification- tion of the register,  and Recommendation No. 20 as to Compensation. RECOMMENDATION  No. 2.         &quot;The length of title now required to be shown for Registration with Absolute Title     &quot;to be reduced from 40  to 20 years.&quot;     We think that this Recommendation is too drastic.   We have pointed out in  Part I. of this Report (para.  8), when dealing with the amendments of the Law of Conveyancing, that such  a shortening of the  statutory period would materially increase  the risk to a  purchaser, but we have recommended that the statutory  period should be reduced to 30 years.  We think that the same arguments apply to the title to be shown for  registration with Absolute  Title. Under the Land Transfer Acts and Rules the length of title to be required for this purpose will be reduced to 30 years, and the same provisions as to  constructive  notice  which  we  have  recom- mended in Part  I. of this  Report for the protection  of  purchasers,  will apply when the title is investigated on first registration. RECOMMENDATION  No.  4.         &quot;After not less than 12  or more than  20 years&apos;  probation,  a Possessory  Title in a     &quot; compulsory area, if undisputed,  to ripen into an Absolute Title  to the first transferee for     &quot;value in cases not exceeding  10,000 in value.&quot;     We attach great importance to facilities  being granted for ripening Possessory  into  Abso- lute Titles, and we concur, therefore, in general with this Recommendation.  We are of opinion that Possessory Titles are of little advantage to  their proprietors,  and are a grave defect in any system  of Registration of  Title.  We are  aware  that under the existing rules the  Registrar has succeeded in a considerable  number of cases in, converting Possessory Titles  into Absolute Titles, but we believe  that this process will be  materially  expedited   if  it receives  statutory authority.  If the conversion into  Absolute  Titles is left to the discretion of the Registrar, there is a possibility that in  some  cases he might be  tempted  to  postpone the  conversion   from motives of caution.  But we believe that there  would be little risk in converting a title afterthe expiration of the probationary period, which  we recommend in the  next paragraph, and thatthe small risk of claims being made on the Guarantee Fund is more than offset by the advan-tage of converting all possessory Titles  into Absolute Titles at as  early a date as possible.    We presume that in recommending a  probationary period of not less than 12 or more than 20 years, the Royal  Commission did not intend  to leave a discretion as to the time within thesetwo points when the title was to be converted, but that they anticipated that the exact period would be specified by statute.  We recommend  that the period of probation should be definitelyfixed, in the case of  freeholds, at  15 years from  the date of granting the Possessory  Title.   Aswe  attach great importance to the  conversion into Absolute Titles, we  think this process  wouldbe seriously retarded if it  were limited  to cases  not exceeding  10,000 in  value, as  recom-mended by the Royal Commission.  We therefore venture to disagree with the Recommendationof the Royal Commission on this  point,  and recommend that  the  process  of conversion intoAbsolute Titles should operate in all cases.    We also observe that  the Royal Commission recommended that a  Possessory Title shouldripen into an Absolute Title to the first transferee  for value.   This provision would delay the dateof conversion, and we think that the conversion should operate for  the  benefit of  the  proprietorregistered at the time  the conversion takes  place.  We do not think that the consent of the registered proprietor to the conversion  is  necessary, and we &quot;therefore think that the  conversionshould, both in the case of freeholds and leaseholds,  be effected without  cost  to  him.  At theexpiration of the probationary period of 15 years, the register should be  amended by the con-
version into an Absolute Title, and the registered proprietor should be given notice to enable himto surrender his certificate of Possessory Title and receive a certificate of Absolute Title.  More-over, we think that the arguments for the restriction of the benefits of  this Recommendation toproperties situate witlvn a  compulsory area are not  so strong as the  arguments for convertingall Possessory Titles into Absolute Titles as soon as possible,  and we think that the process of conversion, both in the case of freehold and leasehold properties, should take place  wherever the registered properties are situate.    Before the Rules of 1908 came into operation, Possessory Titles were granted without certainenquiries which became necessary under these Rules.  While we are anxious that there should beno limit on the operation of this Recommendation, we recognise that there might be some danger in the automatic conversion of Possessory  Titles granted prior to this date.  We therefore recom-mend that the conversion  of  a Possessory Title granted prior to the operation of the Rules of1908, should not be automatic; but  that in such a case the Registrar should have a discretion to convert into an Absolute Title, if after  the expiration of the probationary period, the title isundisputed.RECOMMENDATIONS Nos. 5 AND 6.         &quot;In the case of leaseholds in  a compulsory area,  a Possessory Title after 10 years, if    &quot;undisputed,  to confer a &apos;Good  Leasehold&apos; Title.&quot;         &quot;A  &apos; Good  Leasehold &apos; Title  in such an area hi cases not exceeding   1,000 in value, if    &quot;undisputed,  to confer, after 10  years, an Absolute  Title to the term against  all persons    &quot;interested in the property.&quot;    We  concur in these recommendations, except that as stated above, we think that conversionshould not be limited to properties within a compulsory area.   We also consider it to be undesir-able for the reason we have stated above to limit the  conversion of Good Leasehold Titles intoAbsolute  Titles to cases not exceeding  1,000  in value;  but, for the reason given above,  wethink that in the case of Possessory Titles granted before the operation  of the Rules  of  1908,the Registrar should have a discretion as to the conversion  of a Possessory Title  into a GoodLeasehold Title, or  into an Absolute Title.RECOMMENDATION No.  ;.         &quot; Where settled land is vested in trustees they should  be  registered- as proprietors.     &quot;Settled  land where not  vested in trustees to  be registered merely as subject to the Setlle-     &quot;ment.   In the last-mentioned case the Registrar to issue  certificates  of the  validity of     &quot;the proposed dealings.&quot;    The Royal Commission reported (para. 64)  that the provisions of the present Acts and Rulesin regard to settled land had been very sharply criticised by some  of the witnesses before them,and appeared to be open to serious objection.  The.  Report  of the Royal Commission further pointed out (paragraph 67) that the difficulty of dealing with settlements where the fee simple isnot vested in the trustees, would be removed if the general law were altered  by assimilating theLaw  of Real  Property  to that of Personal Property,  but the Royal Commission considered thattheir  reference did not  permit of their recommending the adoption of such drastic changes.  Thedifficulty  experienced by the  Royal Commission is removed by  Mr.  Cheny&apos;s Law  of PropertyBill, as, under this Bill,  the land will always be vested in the tenant for life of full age, or the statu-tory  owner who has the powers of  a  tenant for life, or on a death (until a vesting assent  hasbeen given) in the name of his personal representative.  The tenant for life is made the custodiantrustee of the land, and trustees are appointed to receive capital moneys.  We recommend there-fore that  settled lands should  be registered in the name of the tenant for life or other statutoryowner, subject, of course, to the proper restriction  requiring capital moneys  to  be  paid to  the trustees, and this  Recommendation is embodied in Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill. RECOMMENDATION  No.  8.          &quot; Transfers to be executed by the transferees.   The  register  to  be cleared  on  every     &quot;change of ownership.&quot;          &quot;A  purchaser of registered  land to  be entitled to a full copy of the entries on the     &quot; register, and to abstracts and production of all instruments entered on the register which     &quot;continue to affect the property.&quot;     We  concur in  this Recommendation, but, with  regard to the execution of transfers, we think that  the Registrar should have power to dispense with  the execution by  a  purchaser wherever he thinks fit, and  to accept in  lieu thereof a specimen signature of the purchaser. We also think that a purchaser should be entitled  to abstracts  and production of all instru- ments noted on the register, which continue to affect  the property, whether entered on the regis- ter or not. RECOMMENDATION  No.  9.          &quot; The estate of the  registered proprietor to be the legal estate, excej)t where that estate      &quot;is outstanding, in which case it would be an  equitable estate, and such estate to be trans-      &quot;Jerable. only  by  registered instrument, the registered proprietor to have complete power      &quot;in  all other respects  of disposing of the property or  creating  any  interest  therein  for      &quot;value&quot;
                                            i6    We concur in this Recommendation, but we do not  admit  any exception, as  under theprovisions of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill the registered proprietor will  only be able in right of his registration to create the &quot;legal estates&quot;  in registered  property, as defined inSection 2 of the  Law of Property Bill.  All  other interests (called minor  interests) will take effect outside the Register.RECOMMENDATION  No. 10.        &quot; Mori gages  of register ed land to be effected in the same manner as if the land were    &quot;unregistered, but a  note of the mortgage deed to be entered on the register, and all mort-    &quot; gages  to  rank  according  to the priority of  their entries.  Dealings with  mortgages    &quot;entered on  the register to  be  regulated  by similar  provisions.  Mortgagees with  power of    *&quot; sale to be authorised to transfer the land on. the conditions stated.   The  Registrar to    &quot;issue certificates as in the case of settled land.&quot;        &quot;In the  case  of certain  securities for present and future advances, the mortgagor only    &quot;  to be able to deal with the equity  of  redemption subject to the total advance agreed    &quot;to be made.&quot;    We agree with the Royal Commission that the present  system  of mortgaging registeredland is not adaptable to any but the more simple cases; but we do  not think that the solutionof the  problem is to leave mortgages of registered land to be effected entirely  outside theregister.  Under  the existing system mortgages can be effected by an absolute transfer to themortgagee.  This practice, which deprives a mortgagor of all  power of dealing with the landon  the register,  will  be rendered impossible  by Part I.-of Mr.  Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill,which provides that a mortgage  can only take effect by demise  or sub-demise.  Subject to thisprovision, we think that the greatest possible latitude should be given to the registered proprietorin dealing with registered land, and he should be able to mortgage or charge (a) by registeredcharge in almost  any form, (b)  by  mortgage  deed in almost any form, protected by a caution(in a special form) within one month from its date, and capable so long as the caution is notwarned off, of being registered as a charge with priority as from the date of the caution, (c) bycharge under hand only  protected by a ordinary caution,  and (d) by deposit of the land cer-certificate, with or without title deeds, according to whether the  title  registered is  possessory orabsolute,&apos;which can be protected by a notice.RECOMMENDATION No. 12.        &quot;A registered proprietor to be  entitled to have an entry made on the register of his    &quot;claim to any easement or similar right which he shozvs to be appurtenant  to  his  estate, ;  ... &quot;such entry  not to prejudice the owner of the tenement affected.&quot;    We find ourselves unable to agree with the Recommendation that a registered proprietorshould  be entitled to have an entry made  on the register of his claim to any easement or similarright which he shows to be appurtenant to his estate.  In our opinion, if any easement or  similarright is registered as  appurtenant to  an  estate, the effect of registration should be the samewith regard to such easement or other right, as in the case, of the land itself.  The  Recom-mendation of the Royal Commission is that the entry of such a claim  should  not prejudice theowner of the tenement affected.  We consider, on the  contrary,  that  the  entry  of  a mere claim is  not a proper subject of registration, and that if  an  entry  appears on the register, it  shouldbind the owner of the servient tenement.    The Report of the Royal Commission (paragraph 74) states that the  registrar claimed to beentitled to register an easement  (as  appurtenant to land) with  or without  Absolute Title, butthat the soundness of this claim  had been disputed, and that there could be no doubt that therewas considerable  uncertainty as  to what the effect of the registration,  if made, would  be.  we agree with the Report of the Royal Commission as to this uncertainty, and think  that it shouldbe cleared up.    An easement, such as a right of way, light or air, which is essential to the enjoyment of the dominant tenement, is often acquired by user, and is unsupported by any instrument in writing.While we think that the mere claim to such an easement should not  be registered, we thinkthat the register of the title of the owner of the dominant tenement would, in many cases, beincomplete without registration of the appurtenant easement or  similar  right.  We therefore recommend that,  if the owner of the dominant tenement can  produce evidence  in  support  ofhis claim, which is satisfactory to the Registrar, the Registrar should give notice of such claimto the owner of the servient tenement, and if the latter does not within a prescribed period showgood cause against the entry being  made, the Registrar should  have  express power to  order anentry of the right to  such easement  or  similar right to be made on the register of title of the dominant tenement, and  also, if the title to.the servient tenement is registered, on the register of the servient tenement.  When such entry has been  made  on  the register  of  the dominanttenement, it should be conclusive proof of the existence  of  such easement or similar right.  Ifthe owner  of the servient tenement, on  receipt of  such  notice from the  Registrar, estab-lishes a prima. facie case against  the registration of such easement or similar right, the  owner ofthe dominant tenement should not be entitled to registration, unless he  can  obtain an Orderfrom a Court of competent jurisdiction declaring his  right to the disputed easement or  similarright.
RECOMMENDATION No.  13.         &quot;Restrictive covenants affecting registered land to be registered by reference to the     &quot;instrument creating them.&quot;         &quot; The Court to be em-powered to discharge or modify obsolete restrictive covenants     &quot;affecting land, whether it be registered or unregistered.&quot;     We concur  in this Recommendation, except that, for the reasons stated in paragraph n, wedo not think that the Court is the most suitable authority to consider applications to dischargeor modify obsolete  restrictive covenants affecting land.  In our opinion (pending the estab-lishment of the  Sanctioning Authority which we recommended in our First Report) the  arbitra-tors  appointed under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, wouldbe a more suitable authority, and should be entrusted with this power.RECOMMENDATION  No.  14.         &quot;&apos;Land Charges&apos; to be treated as outside the system of Registration,  and placed in     &quot;the same position as the liabilities in Section 18 of  the Act  of 1875.&quot;     We are unable to concur in  this Recommendation.  In our opinion, all land charges affect-ing registered land should be noted on the register, and the chargee should  be given power to register his charge if, at any time, it becomes necessary for  him to realise his security.   In ouropinion, the principle to be maintained  is that all encumbrances which would normally be onan abstract of title  should be noted on the  register.   The course we recommend will  saveinvestigation of title off the register if  the chargee has to realise.RECOMMENDATIONS Nos.  18 and 19.         &quot;Provision  to  be made for annulling or rectifying a  registration which is obtained by     &quot; fraud, and for dealing with the case of the registration  by error of tivo persons in respect     &quot;of the same land.&quot;         &quot; The Statutes of Limitation to operate in the same manner ivith regard to registered     &quot; land as with regard to imregistered land.   The rights of parties  in  possession at the     &quot; date of first registration to be protected.&quot;     We concur in general in these Recommendations.   In  our opinion, the title of the person in possession of the land should, Subject to interests overriding the register, as  a general  rule,be maintained,  unless he was responsible for the  mistake  in  the register, or claims  directly under a void  disposition, or claims  otherwise than for value  under a  disposition  to  a  pre-predecessor which was void,  or  unless in any particular case it would  be unjust not to rectify theregister against him.     It is to be observed  that  registered  estates cannot properly be extinguished under the statutes of Limitation, but the  registered proprietor can be made a trustee for the person whohas acquired a title  by possession&apos;, and  the latter should be given a right to apply to be regis-tered as proprietor.RECOMMENDATION  No.  20.         &quot; Compensation to be expressly given to a party ruled out by registration in  respect     &quot;of the value of the land as it  stood at the time  of first registration.   The time  for the     &quot;recovery of compensation  to be limited to six years from the  grant of Absolute Title,     &quot; except in the case of an infant, a  remainderman, a reversioner, and  a mortgagee for     &quot;which special  periods should  be fixed.&quot;     The principles on which  compensation should be given to a party ruled out  by registrationwere clearly defined in  Lord Haldane&apos;s Real Property  and Conveyancing Bill  (Sections  131and  132) with which we concur. We think it should be made clear  that the compensation tobe given should extend to the case of a person suffering loss          (a) by reason of the rectification of the register;         (b)  by reason of an error or omission in the register where  there is no rectification;         (c) who claims in good faith under a forged disposition;but no compensation should be paid if the applicant contributed to the loss by fraud, or claimsotherwise than for value from the person who committed the fraud.     We do not think that compensation  should be given to a party ruled out by registration in respect of the value of the land  as it stood at the time  of first registration.   After a com-paratively short period, it may become impossible to ascertain the value of the land at the timeof first registration.  Nor do we think that in all cases it would be just or  desirable to selectthat date.     In  our opinion, the compensation to be given should  not exceed -         (a) where the  register is  not rectified, the value of the estate, interest or charge at the    time when the error or omission which caused the loss was made  ;         (b) in cases where the  register is rectified, the value (if there had been no rectification-     tion) of the estate, interest or charge immediately before the  date of rectification.    With regard to the periods within which compensation can be recovered, we recommend thatclaims in consequence of registration with an Absolute  or a Good  Leasehold Title should beenforceable only if made within six years from the date of registration, except that    8707                                                                            c
    (a) where a person interested is an infant, the claim by him  may be made within suyears from the time he attains full age;    (b) in the case of settled land, or land held on trust for sale, where a person is interestedin remainder or reversion, the  claim  by him may be made within six years from the timewhen his interest falls  into possession ; or    (c) where any person interested is entitled as a proprietor of a charge, or as a mortgagee,the claim by him may  be made within six years from the last payment in respect of principalor interest.RECOMMENDATION No. 22.         &quot;In a compulsory area  conveyances on sale and leases to take effect on execution,  but    &quot; to become void as regards  the legal estate or interest, unless  registration  is applied  for    &quot;ivithin a month.&quot;    We concur in this recommendation, except that we think that the period of one month withinwhich registration is to be applied for, might sometimes be too short, e.g., in cases where the vendorwas abroad.  We recommend that the  period within which registration is to be applied for shouldbe two months, and that a discretion should be conferred on the Registrar to make an  orderextending this  period, if he is satisfied that the application cannot  be made within this periodwithout incurring unreasonable expense.RECOMMENDATION No. 23.         &quot;Land boundaries to  be described verbally on the register and  maps to be used for    &quot;. assisting identity.&apos;&apos;    We do  not entirely agree with this Recommendation.   Even in regard to unregistered land,it has more and more become recognised that a map or plan  is necessary for the proper identification-tion of the property dealt with, and that the description of the property should  be framed withreference to a plan.   The convenience  of this procedure applies with especial force to registeredland, inasmuch as the filed plan renders the risk of the plan on the land certificate being tamperedwith more remote.   We think that the tendency to rely on a plan for identification of the propertydealt with should be encouraged and that, as a general rule, registered  land should be described by reference to a plan,  and that such&apos;plan should  show the general  boundaries  of the property.The Consolidated  Land Transfer Rules, Nos. 272, 273, and 274 prescribe the procedure to beadopted if it is desired to indicate on the filed plan  the precise  position  of  the boundaries  of theland;  and provide that, except in cases in which  it is  noted  on the property register that the boundaries  have been so fixed, the  filed  plan or general map shall be deemed  to indicate thegeneral boundaries only.   We think that the procedure embodied in these Rules is  convenientand sufficient, and should be retained.   In this connection it should be noted that in rural districtsit is often more difficult to  define the exact boundary of a property than  is the case in urban districts.  It is often  found that the  ownership of a physical boundary, such as a hedge or ditch, isnot apparent from any documentary evidence, and has never been  decided,  and the ownership of  roadside wastes and land abutting on commons is often open to dispute.  This point wouldbecome of greater importance if  registration were to become compulsory for rural districts.     Under the existing system, the Ordnance Maps, on .which the filed  plans are based, show onlythe physical boundaries, which are not always identical with the property boundaries. Dimensionsare only shown on the Land Registry plan where the property boundaries are imaginary.  this practice appears to us to be correct, and, in our opinion/should be  continued. RECOMMENDATION  No. 28.         &quot; The fees on first registration to  be payable by instalments in  20 years with interest     &quot;at 4 per cent,  per annum,  and Section 22 (4) of the Act of  1897  to  be  amended, so  as     &quot;to enable the  balance between  receipts and expenditure to be maintained over a series     &quot;of years instead of in each separate year.&quot;     We venture  to  dissent from this Recommendation.  We  do not think it  is advisable that fees on first registration should be payable by instalments  in 20 years, with interest.  The fees chargeable are, in our opinion, not. sufficiently large to render an option  to pay by instalment attractive, and such an option would  only unnecessarily complicate the  procedure.  Consequently, we do not  think it necessary for this  purpose to amend Section 22 (4)  of the  Act of 1897, as recommended  by the Royal Commission.     So far as regards Registration with an Absolute title, we  have recommended above (Recom- mendation No. 4) that the  conversion into Absolute titles, both in the case of freeholds and lease- holds, should be effected without cost to  the registered proprietor.  In cases where an Absolute title is offered to a  purchaser on first registration, we consider  that, as the purchaser is not necessarily the person who obtains the chief benefit of registration,  the  present  policy, under which, whenever the Registrar is willing to grant an  Absolute title  on first registration,  such registration is effected without extra  cost to the purchaser, should  be continued,  and that the fees payable on first registration in such cases  should be reduced to the lowest possible amount, other fees  taken by  the Registry being adjusted to enable this course to  be followed.
PART  V.The  Effect of the  Proposed  Amendments  of  the  Law  of  Real  Property  andof the Land  Transfer Acts on the  System  of  Registration  of  Title  to  Land.    34.  A study of Part X. of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill will show that the objectof that part of the Bill is to give effect to the Recommendations of the Royal Commission, asamended by the Recommendations which we have made in Part IV. of this Report, and tomake the Land Transfer Acts harmonise with the changes effected in the general law of real property by the Law of Property Bill.    We desire  at this point to draw attention to the effect  of Part X. of  Mr.  Cherry&apos;s law of Property Bill on the existing system of registration of title to land.    35.  In the first place, it will always be possible to ascertain from the register in whom thelegal  estate in the registered land is vested.  Land which is the  subject of a strict settlementwill be registered in the name of the tenant  for life or the  statutory owner having the powersof a tenant for life, and the interests of successive tenants  for life  and  remaindermen andother minor interests under the settlement  will take  effect in  equity.  The registered proprietorwill have full power to  deal with the registered  estate by  way  of  sale, mortgage or  lease,including the power to  grant easements and rent charges.   The only interests in land  whichwill be capable of registration will be the fee simple and terms of years  absolute,  and alldispositions which do not pass or charge the fee simple or terms of years  absolute, such as lifeestates, leases depending on lives, remainders, reversions, executory and other like interests,will only be capable of taking effect  in equity.    A  purchaser or mortgagee will not be con-cerned with the beneficial interest existing in any property, but  will  be entitled to treat the registered proprietor as the  absolute owner.  The fact that he is required by a restriction topay the purchase money to persons  other than the vendor, may inform him that the land is thesubject of  a settlement, but will not give rise to any obligation to investigate the trusts ofsuch settlement.    No undivided  shares w&apos;ll be registered,  and  the entirety of land  formerly registered inundivided shares must be registered,  and, if necessary, re-registered, in the names of the  trustees,who will hold  the land in trust  for sale.    As every facility will be given for the conversion of titles  of a lower quality into Abso-lute  Titles, the register will eventually consist  only of Absolute Titles,  and the need for investigation of titles off the  register, which, at present, is so often  necessary  in the case ofPossessory Titles, will  cease  to  exist.    36.  An effect  of  Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill  which will carry great weight withsome critics of the existing Land Transfer Acts will  be that, when a property has been regis-tered, the  functions of the  Registrar  will, in practically  every respect, cease to be judicial,and  will become purely ministerial.  It is clear that, until  a  property has been registered, the registrar must be given discretion  as to the title to  be registered, the proprietor to be regis-tered, the  description of the  property, and of the appurtenant  easements  (if any) and othermatters.    But  when registration  has been  effected, it is,&apos;  in our opinion,  of  the  greatest    8707                                                                            C2        &quot; The system of Registration of Title to be amended according to  our recommenda-    &quot;Hons; and if after sufficient experience the amended system is found  to work  salisfac-    &quot; lorily in the existing compulsory area, Parliament to be invited to consider the gradual    &quot;extension of compulsion to the rest  of the country.&quot;   :  -    We have dealt with the subject of this Recommendation in  Part VII. of this Report.RECOMMENDATION No. 33.        &quot;County  Councils to be empowered to establish local  &quot;Registries of Deeds.&apos; &quot;    Having regard to the view we express in Part VII. of this Report as to the possible exten-sion of the system of  Registration of Title, we have found it  necessary to dissent from thisRecommendation (see paragraph 51).    33. It is obvious that the changes effected by the Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill in thegeneral law will necessitate consequential  alterations in  the Land Transfer  Acts  of 1875 and1897, so as to make these Acts harmonise with the new system. These consequential alterations,which are  of a technical nature, are set out in the  16th Schedule  of  Mr. Cherry&apos;s  Law of  Pro-perty Bill.
importance that official control over dealings with  land should be reduced to the lowest degreecompatible with efficiency, and we believe that if this object is achieved, it would have a greatereffect in making the system popular than any other amendments of the Land Transfer Acts.    As an instance of the way in which Mr.  Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill will affect the judicial functions at present exercised by the Registrar, we may refer to Section 2 of Part II. of the16th Schedule of Mr.  Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill, which deals with the devolution of settledland.   Under the present system (Section 41  of the Land Transfer Act, 1875), on the  death  ofa tenant for life, such person is registered as proprietor in the place of the deceased proprietor  asmay, on the application of any person interested in the land, be appointed by the Registrar,regard being had to the rights of the several persons interested in  such land, and  in particular to the  selection of such person as may for the time being appear  to the Registrar to be entitledaccording to law to be so appointed.  Section 6, subsection 4, of the Land  Transfer Act,  1897,provides that, on the death of a tenant for life, it will be the duty of the Trustees of the settle-ment to apply for registration of his successor, but  if the Trustees neglect to apply, or there areno such Trustees, the Registrar shall proceed under the 41st Section of the Act of 1875.  Part II.,Section 2 (4) of the 16th Schedule of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill provides that on the death of a life tenant,  his personal representatives shall take the land upon trust to transfer  it to thenext tenant for life, or other statutory owner.  The Registrars duties  on the  occasion of the death of a tenant lor life will, therefore, be of the same ministerial character  as on the death of aproprietor absolutely entitled.    37.  We may also refer to our Recommendations in paragraph 32 as to the conversion  ofPossessory Titles into  Absolute Titles which are embodied in Part X. of Mr.  Cherry&apos;s Law  ofProperty Bill, the essence of which is that the conversion should  operate automatically at theexpiration of the period of probation, without the exercise  of  any judicial function on  the  partof the  Registrar.    38.  In short, the  effect of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill on the System of registration of Title to land will be to realise more completely  than  at present the aims of the authors of thesystem.  With the  exception of certain interests  which are not capable of  registration (such  as some easements) the register will show clearly the property to be dealt  with, and all charges  towhich  it is subject, and a purchaser, lessee or mortgagee  will be able to  deal  with the registeredproprietor without making any enquiry as to beneficial  interests.  We concur with the Report ofthe Select Committee on Land Titles and Transfer of 1878,* which stated that  &quot;to legislate forthe registration of  titles  without simplifying the title to be registered  is to begin at the wrong-end.&quot;  Though a register of title to land can never, owing to the nature of land, completely attainthe simplicity of a register of  stocks and shares, which  appears to  be   the ideal  of  someenthusiasts, yet  we believe that the amendments which we have recommended will go far  toapproximate to that ideal  and will eliminate  many of the defects in the present system which aredemonstrated  by its critics.PART VI.Comparison of  the  Transfer of  Unregistered  Land with that of Registered Land                               under  the Proposed  System.    39.  It will generally be agreed that an ideal system of  land  transfer should be simple andcheap, and that it should be adapted to the needs and even to the prejudices of the community.No system could be considered ideal unless the land to be  dealt with, together with the encum-brances to which it is subject, and the person or persons  who are entitled to deal with it, couldbe readily ascertained.  If this degree of simplicity in the  title  to  land  were  attainable, theformalities required for  dealing with the land in any  desired manner could be correspondinglysimple, and  the remaining desiderata of expedition and cheapness would follow.    In a newly developed country,  and particularly in a  new country where the property in allland is originally vested in the  Crown, there should be no  great difficulty, having regard to thevarious systems which have already been tested in different countries,  in devising  a system which, if it did not fulfil,  at least might approximate to, the ideal conditions we have  described.It cannot be maintained that the system of land transfer  prevailing in England and Wales fulfilsthese conditions, but the  task  of amending the law, so that the  system of transfer of  land shallmore closely approximate to these conditions,  is rendered extremely difficult because of the com-plexities which have grown up  during centuries of highly developed civilisation.  Wre are, how-ever,  convinced that many of these difficulties can be overcome.     40. Evidence  was  given  before  the Royal  Commission of defects  which  were  thenalleged to exist in the  working of the Land Transfer Acts and their administration;  and of the reluctance of land owners to make use of the Registry.  While, on the other hand, evidence wasgiven by the Registrar of the  advantages to be obtained by registration with  Absolute Title.The existing administration of the system of Registration of  Title does not materially differ from.*H.C. 244,  1878-9.
143the administration at the date of the Report of the Royal  Commission.  We  have,  therefore,considered it unnecessary to cover the ground which was so fully covered by the Royal Commis-sion, and this has enabled us to  direct our attention more particularly to the comparison, whichis inevitable, between the two systems of Registration of Title and Transfer by unregistered assur-ance.  But this comparison  should not, in view of our  Recommendations, be made between thetwo  systems as they exist to-day,  but between the system of Registration of Title, as amended in accordance with  our Recommendations,  and the system of transfer by unregistered assuranceas it would exist if Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill became law.     41.  We have shown in Part III. of this Report  that if  Mr. Cherry&apos;s  Law of  PropertyBill  becomes law,  the system of Conveyancing of unregistered land will be  fundamentally sim-plified.   The assimilation of the Law of Real Property to that of Personal Property, and theabolition of  copyholds and customary tenures, will, apart from amendments in the law of con-vcyancing,  eliminate many of  the complications which at present encumber the title to land.Great  simplification is effected  immediately throughout  the country,  first  by transference ofequitable interests  to take effect behind  either a trust for  sale or a settlement; secondly, bythe getting in of all bare outstanding legal  estates; thirdly, by  the  abolition of  all undividedshares in land,  the entirety being vested  in trustees for sale; fourthly, by the  conversion of legal mortgages of the  fee  into mortgages  for long terms;  and,  fifthly,  by the  provision thatin the  case of existing settlements a vesting deed shall be executed which  will  take the oldtrusts  off the title.  Still,  no doubt the absence of errors due to the abolition of  technical rules and  the simplification of the system will not be fully felt for a considerable period. After thissystem has become law, the title to land  will consist.mainly of  transfers  from  one owner  toanother, and the complications, which are at present caused by the creation of settlements andthe existence of equities, will cease to affect the title which has to be investigated by a pur-chaser.     42. It has been urged upon us that the  existing  system of Conveyancing  by Deed is onewhich  is well adapted to the needs of the community.     In particular, it has been suggested to us that in  country districts the  existing systemof   transfer  by  unregistered   assurance  has  many  advantages  over   that of  registra-tion   of title,  and  that   one  of  the   greatest of  these  advantages is  that  countrybanks   are  able,  under   the  existing system,   to  make  advances   on   title  deeds,coupled   with  the  assurance  of  the borrowers solicitor  that the borrowers   title  isin order.  We  have taken some  evidence on  this  point,  from  which it  appears  that,while bankers have to make certain searches in the case of registered land, which are not neces-sary in the case of unregistered land, they would probably not object on this ground to Regis-tration of Title becoming universal, because in that event the searches and enquiries to be made would become a matter of common form.   It also appears to be the case  that advances are usually  only made  by banks at short notice to customers whose financial status is well knownto the bank, and that,  in fact,  such advances are made as much on the personal credit of the customer as  on the security offered.     43.  On the other hand, there is no  doubt that  the proposed amendments  of the law of real Property and Conveyancing,  apart from the proposed amendments of the Land TransferActs themselves, will assist Registration of Title.  The Report of the Royal Commission pointsout (paragraph 97)  that &quot; there is  a close connection  between the  law regulating the transfer&quot; of  land and the  general law  of  Real Property.  Experience of the working of the Registra-&quot;t&apos;:on system shows, in our opinion, that it would  be  greatly  facilitated by improvements - in&quot;the law of Real  Property,&quot;  and  in paragraph 101,  the Commissioners record  their opinionthat &quot;the complete  establishment of a system of  land transfer satisfactory to  the public and&quot; fulfilling the expectations of the authors  of the Land Transfer Acts, would be materially aided&quot;by  the  assimilation of the law of Real Property to that of Personal Property.&quot;     44.  In the first place the simplification of the title to land would greatly facilitate the grant-ing of Absolute Titles,  and would  reduce the time and trouble which is! now involved in investi-gating the title to land before an Absolute Title can be granted.&quot;  As we have  stated above, weare of opinion that  the system of registration of title  can only be  considered  efficient in cases,when Absolute Titles have been granted, and any reform which assisted the granting of Abso-lute  Titles  would  necessarily greatly assist  the work and efficiency of the Land Registry.     The proposed alterations in the law of Real  Property  and  of Conveyancing would alsomaterially affect the work of the Registry after the land Las been put  on the  register.   Forinstance, if land held on trust for sale is registered, then all equitable interests, which  formerlywere paramount to the trust for sale, will, under the new system, be made to take effect in respectof the proceeds of sale.  This will enable  the register to be  cleared of all entries protecting suchequitable interests.  For example, undivided shares in land may have been  registered and a chargemay have been registered against each share.  When the Act comes into force  the entirety ofthe land  will be registered  in the names  of the trustees  for sale, who  will give effect to thecharges  on  the shares, thus enabling the registered charges on the shares  to be ruled out.     The same principle applies in the case of settled land registered  subject to   an  equitableinterest.  For the equitable interest is (without prejudice to  its  priority over  the other limita-tions of the settlement) made to take effect as if limited  by the settlement  itself, thus  enabling the registered proprietor (subject to the money being paid to the trustees in  accordance with theusual restriction) to  override the equitable interest.
PART  VII.     Recommendations  as  to  Extension of Compulsory  Registration.     45. We have now to deal with the question whether  a probationary period should elapseafter the passing of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill, during which the  existing system  of transfer of unregistered land, as amended by the new system, could be compared with the systemof Registration of  Title, before any alteration is made in  the present law, under  which com-pulsory Registration can be extended.     We are unanimous in  recommending the adoption of  the amendments in the  law of real property and Conveyancing embodied in Mr.  Cherry&apos;s Law of Property Bill, and  we are con-vinced of the simplicity which will be  effected by that Bill, not only in dealings with  unregisteredland, but  also in dealings  with registered land,  both on first  registration  and on subsequentdealings.  It is  also  to be observed  that  while that  Bill will  reduce the  examination andre-examination of  title to  a minimum on dealings with unregistered land, yet, it is only by regis-tration with an Absolute Title that the necessity of examining past documents affecting the legal estate can be avoided, and that a State guarantee of  the  validity of a title  can be  obtained.Moreover, while, in most transfers of unregistered land,  the  land  must be  described in full on each occasion, a register of title affords a proper description which can be  referred to withoutrepeating the description, save where  part of the land only is being dealt  with.   This  lattercharacteristic of  a register, while an advantage, is, in our opinion, only a minor advantage.     We anticipate also that this Bill  (quite apart from  its  effect  on  the general Law  of real property) will, by practically eliminating the judicial functions of the Registrar, after registra-tion with an Absolute Title, go far to  remove the objections which are entertained  by many  tothe existing system of Registration, since it is obvious that every simplification of the general Lawmust reduce the  number of cases in which a judicial decision, whether of the  Court, or any other authority, will be required.     46. The Royal Commission on the Land Transfer Acts found (paragraph 95) that the systemof Registration as  it then stood was in their judgment imperfect, and they were unable to recom-mend the compulsory extension of an imperfect system.  Wre agree that the  present system isnot perfect, and  we consider it to be essential that the law  of Real Property and Conveyancingand  also the Land Transfer Acts should be amended in  the manner which  we have recom-mended.   But this having been done, we think that the existing law, whereby  compulsory  regis-tration can be extended, should be altered in the manner described in the next paragraph.     47. The extension of the Land Transfer Acts under the existing law depends upon Section20 of the  Land Transfer  Act, 1897,  Sub-section 8 of this Section provides that no Order forthe extension of the system after the  first Order is to be made under the Act &quot; except as to a county or part of a County which shall have signified through the County Council of such County,pursuant to a resolution of such Council passed at the meeting at which two-thirds of the wholenumber of the members shall  be present, its desire that Registration of Title shall be compulsorilyapplied to it.&quot;  The first and only Order made under the Act applied compulsory Registration  tothe County  and City of London, but no further extension of the compulsory system has beenmade, as no County has yet signified its desire for such extension in the manner indicated.  TheReport of the Royal Commission (para. 95) states that the gradual extension  of compulsion onsales to the rest  of the Country is a national, rather than a local,  question.  We concur in this opinion,  which  we  believe  is   now   generally  admitted.    We  recommend,   therefore,that sub-sections 6, 8 and 9 of Section 20 of the Land Transfer  Act, 1897, should  be repealedso far as regards future Orders to be  made under that Section.  We think, however, that within six months after receipt of notice of  a proposed Order in Council  extending the  compulsoryprovisions of the Land  Transfer Acts to any  County or part of a County, the local authorities of that area (by  which we mean the County Councils and the County Borough Councils  affected),and also the Law Society in whose district the County  is situated, or any of them, should have aright to demand  a public enquiry to be held in the County as to the desirability of extending com-pulsory registration to the  County.  The local authority within ten days of the receipt of such notice should furnish a copy thereof to such Law Society.   The object of holding  the enquiry should, in our opinion, be to ascertain if  there are any  reasons  why compulsory  Registrationshould not be extended to the County.  In addition to the County Council, such other persons asthe person holding the enquiry may admit, or as may be nominated by or on behalf of the localLaw Society should be entitled to be heard.   We have noted in our First  Report*  that a very general complaint in regard to the holding of enquiries by departmental inspectors on the applica-tions for Provisional Orders is that the nature of the  Inspectors  report  and  the  reasons  forwhich the application  is postponed or  rejected departmentally  are not publicly explained.  we attach the greatest importance to publicity in all such enquiries, and, if the public enquiry  whichwe are now advocating is to give satisfaction,  we consider  it essential  that the  report of theperson holding the enquiry  should be made public as soon as possible, and  before the proposed order  in Council is made.   The person holding the  enquiry should be appointed by the LordChancellor, who  should also from time  to time, make rules as to the procedure to be  observed  at such enquiries, the expenses to be incurred, and other questions connected with such enquiries.     If, after publication of  the report  of the person holding the public enquiry, or after the period*Cd 8998.
of six months, within which the enquiry should be demanded, has passed without such demandbeing made, an Order in Council is to be made under Section 20 of the Act of 1897, the draftof such Order should be  laid upon the table of both Houses of Parliament while Parliament issitting, and, if and when an address in either House  is carried, approving of such draft Order, theOrder  should forthwith be made, but not otherwise.  If an  address  is not carried in the first session in which the draft Order is so laid, the draft Order may be laid (with any necessary amend-ments as to the date when it should take effect) in any subsequent session or sessions.    No Order should be made until after the expiration of two years from the commencement ofthe Act, and not more than  one Order should be made  within three years  from the commence-ment of the Act.   The first Order made under these provisions should not affect more than oneCounty with any County Borough surrounded by or contiguous to such County.    48.  We have had some interesting evidence from Sir Charles Fortescue-Brickdale, as to theprocedure which he recommends should be  adopted on the extension of compulsory Registrationto any  area.   In his opinion the  most suitable territorial unit would be a district containing a population of about four  millions.  If compulsory registration were eventually to extend to thewhole of England and Wales, this would  involve  the  institution of eight  or nine RegistryOffices, including the London Registry.  The district offices of the Land Valuation department were established  approximately on these  lines.  The situation  of the  District Land RegistryOffices would be selected with regard to the facilities for communication by railway with the areadealt with.  Compulsory registration would be confined  at first to  a large town within the areaselected, which would  probably be the&apos; town  in which  the  District  Registry was to be estab-lished.  From this centre compulsory registration would gradually  be extended to include thewhole of the area contained  in the Order, the rural district  surrounding a town  being taken after the town itself, and before  any further extension.  We do not consider it to be within ourprovince to pronounce in  detail upon the above suggestions.    49. In our  opinion, the costs of Registration should  be paid  out of  fees,  and, if  it isfound that the existing scale of fees proves inadequate,  these should be  adjusted to the requiredscale.  We are informed that the heaviest  expenditure  of the Registry is incurred on first Regis-tration, and that greater  profit  is  made on subsequent dealings with registered land.  It appearslikely,  therefore, that the expense of registries hereafter established would, for many years, be defrayed out of the profits arising from  registries which  have been established for a longer period.If the operations of the Land Registry as a whole in any year showed a loss, the balance wouldhave to be borne by the  Treasury, but we  think that  the fees of the Registry should  be  soadjusted as to cover its, cost.    50. We have received  evidence that the Ordnance Survey Department was prepared to actin close co-operation with the Land Registry, and it  was  estimated that  considerable  savingwould  thereby be effected.  It  is  probable that if the  Ordnance  Survey Department undertakesthe whole of the mapping for the Land Registry, the Ordnance Survey Department will requireto have the existing staff, to a small extent, augmented by the  addition  of  surveyors with  aspecial  knowledge  of  the work required by  the Land Registry, as  it  appears that experience in dealing with the description of property in deeds has been found essential by the MappingDepartment of the Land Registry.    We recommend that this suggestion should be adopted, and, in that event, part of the exist-ing Mapping Department of the Land Registry  would, presumably,  be transferred  to the ordnance Survey  Department, which should, particularly  if the compulsory  area is  enlarged,be able to supply the services required by the Land Registry at a cost considerably less thanthat of the existing system.    51. We have considered whether local Deed  Registries should  be  established on the linesof the Yorkshire and Middlesex Deeds Registries.   It is true that in Yorkshire, at any rate, thelocal  Deeds  Registry is favoured by the  solicitors and counsel in the district, as affording pro-tection against fraud, and also that to some extent a Deeds Registry,  which has been establised for a considerable period, would assist a Registry of Title, if subsequently established in thesame district, on the granting of Absolute Titles. But, on the other hand, the establishment offurther local  Deeds  Registries would occasion a considerable amount of expense which, in viewof the limited protection afforded by this  system, and  of the possibility that Registries of Titlemay eventually  be established throughout England and Wales, we do not feel justified in recom-mending.     52. We have also considered whether greater facilities should be afforded for voluntaryRegistration of  Title in districts in  which Registration is  not  compulsory.    Such voluntaryRegistration can at present be  effected with the Land Registry in London, and we think thatthis provision affords all the facilities that are at present required.   In our opinion the expenseof  Registration should be  borne by the persons or classes  benefited, and we see no reason whyany such expense should be borne by the State  as a  whole.  We do not, therefore, considerthat any special inducement to voluntary Registration, either by reduction of fees or otherwise,is necessary or desirable.     53. The Committee desire  in conclusion to put on record their sense of the lasting obliga-tion under which the services of Mr. Cherry have laid the Nation.  In our view, his draft Bill isa very great contribution to the cause of legal reform and, whilst  recognising the assistanceafforded by his predecessors in the same cause, the  result  is largely due to his own completemastery of  the  subject,  his  skill in  thinking out  his own solutions  and  the indefatigableperseverance shown by him  in the performance of so heavy a task.\
   Mr. Eustace Davies was our Secretary throughout our first three enquiries, viz., Land Acquisi-&apos;tion, Assessment of Compensation and Mining questions, but had to leave us for work at the WarOffice in the middle of our present enquiry.  His knowledge and experience in all matters relat-ing to land were of great use to us, and we desire to express our warm recognition of his services to the Land Acquisition Committee.    Mr. Bernard Drake joined the Committee in January,  1918,  and ever since that  time theknowledge and experience which he possesses as a solicitor have  been of the greatest  use.  Hehas assisted us greatly throughout this Land Transfer Enquiry.   The present report has  been drafted by him, as well as our Second and Third Reports, and we are very  deeply grateful tohim for the skill and  hard work which he has devoted to his task.

We desire to thank Mr. Underhill and his Sub-Committee for their  very  great assistance.The  matters  considered by  them involved prolonged consideration of legal questions of a tech-nical character, and without their  expert help  and constructive criticism  of Mr. Cherry&apos;s DraftBill, we could not have covered the whole  field of our reference.             t RESERVATION BY SIR  WILLIAM  MIDDLEBROOK.    I approve this Report, except that in my opinion the benefits of Deeds Registries have notbeen fully appreciated by the Committee.  Each of the three Ridings in the County of Yorkhas for a considerable time had a Registry for Deeds, which has worked most satisfactorily, andI do not know of any desire in  that County to exchange a Registry of Titles for the existingRegistry of Deeds.   In my opinion  the system of Deeds Registries should be further consideredbefore any question of extension of compulsory registration of title is proposed.  The successfulworking of the Yorkshire. Deeds Registries confirms this opinion.                                               (Signed) Wm.  MIDDLEBROOK.1
                                     APPENDIX  I.       THE    LINE    OF   LEAST    RESISTANCE.AN  EASY   BUT  EFFECTIVE   METHOD  OF  SIMPLIFYING  THE                          LAW  OF  REAL  PROPERTY                                              BY                           MR.  ARTHUR  UNDERHILL,                       Senior Conveyancing Counsel  of the Court.                  INTRODUCTORY.THE object of this  pamphlet  is not to advocate any political changes in the respective rights and dutiesof landlord and  tenant, nor  in the respective rightsand duties of the State and landowner.   It is exclu-sively concerned  with the present complicated  law re-lating to the ownership, settlement, and devolution ofland, and the consequent difficulty and expense of in-vestigating the title to it on the occasion of sales, mort-gages,  and other transactions.   For  this  obviouslyundesirable state of  affairs I conceive that a short andeasy remedy  is  available  which would  not inflict ascintilla  of  material  injury  upon anyone, and thisremedy  will be presently explained.   That the present law of real  property  is cumbrous,archaic, and expensive  no  one acquainted with it candeny,  and the principal reason is  this that on everyoccasion  on  which  lands (which,  of course,  includeshouses and other buildings) are dealt with by sale ormortgage, it is necessary  for  the  purchaser or mort-gagee to satisfy himself that &apos;the vendor or mortgagorhas sufficient ownership or power to  enable  him tosell or mortgage them  effectually;  and this can onlybe done by a  skilled mind  investigating the history ofthe property (often  very complicated) for a consider-able period.  That period has,  by the Vendor and Pur-chaser Act,  1874, been primd facie fixed at forty years in the case of sales,  and no doubt very few mortgageeswould require a longer title.  But the forty years mustbegin  with what conveyancers call &quot;a good root,&quot; andthis, of  course, you  cannot always find without going beyond the forty years; for you  cannot commence the title in  nubibus, but must begin  with some  deed orwill by which the absolute ownership was affected.   Now, perhaps, the lay reader may say, why should there be a difference in this respect between land and goods?  If a man buys  a horse,  a motor car, a watch,or stocks and shares, it never enters his  mind to de-mand a history of the vendor&apos;s title.   The  answer to this  is fourfold.  In the first place,lands and houses are fixed. They remain in situ, and can always be found.   A watch, a horse, or a motorcar, on the other hand,  may be stolen and never againseen, or, if seen, identified; and with regard to stocks and shares,  the  ownership is registered  in the Com-pany&apos;s books, and the title of the  registered owner tosell or mortgage is guaranteed by  law.   Nevertheless,if you pay ^7i,ooo  for a car, and it turns out  to havebeen stolen by the vendor, and  the true owner identified-satisfactory it in your possession,  he  can  recover it unless itwas sold in open market.  It is, however, so  difficultto find a stolen article when once it has been sold andits appearance altered,  that the risk is  not appreciatedby the public.  In the case of  land, on the other hand,the real owner can always lay his hand on it, so thatit is quite impossible for  a thief  to steal, hide, and finally sell it to another free from any appreciable dan-ger of the true owner  reclaiming it.   In the second place,  legal  ownership of  chattelscan only be  absolute.   If you wish (as is occasionallydone with furniture, jewels, pictures, and the like, andis frequently done  with stocks and shares)  to  settlethem  on persons in succession, you have to vest thelegal ownership in a trustee, and make him undertaketo hold that legal ownership for persons in succession;whereas, as  will appear  presently,  freehold,  and tosome  extent copyhold,  land can be settled at law onpersons in succession without any trust whatever.  Itwould, therefore, be quite  possible (if no investigation     8707of the title were made by a  purchaser or mortgagee)for a person in possession of land as life tenant only,to purport to sell  it absolutely (or as lawyers say &quot;infee simple &quot;) to a  purchaser,  who might have his titleunquestioned until the life tenant died (perhaps fifty years after),  but would then find himself liable to eject-ment.   A third reason for investigating the title is that land(unlike goods or stocks) may be the subject of ease-ments, restrictive  covenants, and  rent charges.   Forinstance,  the next door neighbour may  have a rightof way through the property, or a previous vendormay have imposed on the property a restriction against it use for any other than residential purposes, or the like; or  the vendor or his predecessors  in  title mayhave created rent charges on  it, or, still worse, upon, itand other adjacent land together; and if a purchaseror mortgagee refrains from  investigating the title hewill take the property subject to these incumbrances.   Lastly, the property may be mortgaged&apos;, and as thereis (outside of Yorkshire and  Middlesex) no register ofmortgages, it is only by investigating the title and  in-specting  the  deeds  that  he  can safeguard  himselfagainst that danger.  Chattels, on the other hand, canonly be mortgaged by delivering  them into the custody of the mortgagee (usually the benevolent being whopresides at the sign of the Three Balls) by  way  ofpledge, or by executing a  duly registered bill of sale.But, as that register is open to public inspection, andis, in fact, regularly published in  trade journals,  thisplays havoc with the credit of the mortgagor, and billsof sale are only given in the  last resort.   For these reasons,  then, an  investigation of the title is in the nature of things necessary before a pru-dent purchaser or mortgagee accepts it.   Now  if land,  like stocks and  chattels, were onlycapable of being held absolutely, and if a purchaser ormortgagee were free from  investigating trusts,  thiswould present very  little difficulty or expense, for  thehistory of the title  would merely consist of the prc-diuction  of  conveyances&apos;, mortgages^  and wills,  andproofs of intestacies during the  past forty years.   But in point of fact this simplicity  does  not exist,because the Common Law to some extent,  Courts of equity to a greater  extent,  the ill-considered legisla-tion most of all,  have introduced the  following com-plexities:        (a)  Three collateral  systems of holding land    have  been  evolved (viz., freehold, copyhold,  and    leasehold),  where there  was originally one only.       (b) With regard  to  freehold  tenure, and, to    some slight extent, to copyhold tenure, the owner-    ship  may be  split up into  a  series  of  successive    partial and limited interests without the interven-    tion  of  a trustee, in consequence of which before    1882  (when the first great Settled Land Act  was    passed) it was often impossible to deal  with land    by sale, mortgage, or lease unless the owners of    all these partial  interests could be gathered  to-    gether and persuaded to be unanimous.  On  the    other  hand,  leasehold  ownership  (like stocks,    shares,  chattels, and  money) can  only  be  settled    by the  intervention of a trustee,  the law recog-    recognising no ownership except absolute ownership.       (c) With regard to all three kinds, concurrent    ownership is  allowed. This may consist of &quot;joint    tenancy &quot; or  &quot; tenancy in common.&quot;  In the for-    mer, on the death  of one joint tenant, his interest                                            P
    passes to the survivors.  In tenancy  in  common,    on the other hand, on the death of one of the co-    owners,  his  share passes under his will or intes-    tacy, and may thus become further divided.  Not    infrequently  a house or  two  may thus become    owned by thirty or forty persons in different undi-    vkled shares, with the  result that  it is impossible    to deal with the property in any wiay without  an    expensive action  for partition or sale by the Chan-    cery Division.        (d) Courts of  Equity have invented the doctrine    that if a person buys or takes a mortgage or lease    of property with  notice  that the vendor, mortgagor    or lessor is a trustee of it, he must investigate the    trust, and satisfy himself  that the trust instrument    authorises  the  transaction.        (e) Lastly,  a  perpetual  or   temporary rent  or    even a series of perpetual or temporary rents (the    former very  common in Lancashire and  the latter    everywhere), may be reserved out  of land, which,    of  course,  adds  to  the complexity of  the title.    These rents,  whether created   by  conveyances  of    the  land in  fee  simple,  or by leases  and  sub-    leases, cause very great  expense to railway com-    panies and other bodies taking land compulsorily,    because  such  bodies  have  to  purchase  every    interest  in the land, and therefore may have  to    buy out, not only the owner in fee simple, but a    ground lessee, a sub-lessee for a long  term  of    years at  an  improved   ground&apos; rent, a  sub-sub-    lessee at a higher rent, and perhaps an occupying    &apos; tenant (a).   Of these complexities I hope later on to shew that(a), (b), (c), and  (d) are  capable of  being so dealt withas to reduce the present chaos  to  some semblance  ofsimplicity. With regard to (e),  I  am  afraid  that nothingcan be done, because the people themselves, in certain parts  of England, have evolved  the practice of buyingland at a chief (perpetual) rent instead of purchasing it for a lump sum; and in the  same  way builders have in other parts (notably in London)  evolved the analo-gous  system  of taking long leases  (99  years) at smallground rents, reckoning that during  that long termthey will be  able, not only  to recoup themselves their capital expenditure on bricks and mortar, but also  Comake a handsome profit. In  my opinion,  therefore, itis useless to  attack these systems.   Indeed, it  is very doubtful whether London could have been built upon any other system.   In-order that  the subject may be considered intelli-gently it is essential that the render should have someelementary knowledge of the history of land tenure  inthis country, beginning  with  freehold  tenure.     The Origin  and History of  Freeholds.   Whatever may have been the governing principle ofland ownership before the Conquest, that  great eventhad the effect  of subjecting  the land  of  England  tofeudal tenure.   In theory  the  Sovereign alone owned the land.  Allother  persons  having   proprietory   rights in it were&quot; tenants,&quot; either of the King himself (tenants in chief),or of  some intermediate  Lord.  &quot;Tenure&quot; and &quot;seizing&quot;(a highly technical word by no  means satisfied by actualpossession  (&amp;)) and not ownership was, and still is, thetheoretical foundation of a subjeofs right to property infreehold and  copyhold land; and, in  its  inception, everytenant owed  not  only some kind of duty or.service  tohis immediate Lord,  but he also did homage  to him(t.e., swore to become his man), the Lord,  on his part,undertaking the tenanfs protection.   In the case of the tenants in chief  of the  Crown,  this service (with theexception of grants made direct to the Church) usuallytook  the  form  of Knights&apos; service, i.e.,  each of thegreat tenants had to find a  certain  number of Knightsand  men-at-arms duly equipped for the King&apos;s warswhen called  upon,  and  failure to perform the service(just as now failure to pay rent under a lease) involveddistraint by the Lord on the defaulter^ chattels.   The root idea being tenancy and not  absolute owner-ship,  it followed that the tenancy might be either tem-porary or permanent,  and the  extent of the tenant&apos;s in-terest&quot; was called his  &quot;estate&quot; (i.e.,  his status).   Forsome  reason, difficult to  fathom, only two  &quot;estates&quot;  ortenancies were originally regarded  as fit for  free men(hence called the &quot;freehold&quot;), viz.,   an estate for life   (a) It is this  complexity and plurality of ownership rather than thecost of investigating titles which really adds  to  the  expense of purchases.   (/&apos;) See Coprstake v. Hoper, (iqoS) 2 Ch. 10, 17.(which was the effect of a grant without the heirs beingmentioned),  or  an estate to the tenant and his heirsfor ever (called  an estate in fee simple).   The lattermight, however, be liable to be defeated by a conditionbroken, or by the happening of some stated event.   Originally these estates were created thus :    Grants  were  made  by the King to his  great noblesof large tracts of land called  Honours or  Baronies,nearly all  of which have for practical purposes dis-appeared.  Thus,  Sussex was divided into the six greatHonours  of Chichester, Arundel,  Bramber,  Lewes,Pevensey,  and  Hastings, each  having  its castle andforest.  The  County  of  Chester  (except  the epis-copal estates) was an &quot; Honour&quot; of itself, belonging tothe Earl, and so forth.   The tenant in chief of these Honours in turn grantedto sub-tenants of wealth and station, considerable tractsof land called Manors, mainly on corresponding terms,the Lord of each Manor relieving  the Lord  of  the honour of his burden to the King by furnishing  a cer-tain number of Knights and men-at-arms for the King&apos;swars  as part of the army which the tenant  in chief hadto provide.   The Manor may be said to have  been  the  politicalunit of landlordship.  Each Manor was a kind  of pettykingdom  within itself,  with  its own &quot; Court Baron&quot;for civil disputes between Lord and  tenant or betweenthe tenants themselves,  in which  the freehold  tenantswere  the jurors  and the steward the judge; and it wasonly  after centuries of  conflict  between  the  King&apos;sCourts and the Manorial Courts that the King&apos;s justicesuperseded  or  controlled the Manorial tribunals and reduced them to mere shadows of the past.   The Lord of an Honour was,  therefore, roughly afeudatory Prince or military governor;  the Lord of aManor was a feudal Lord who,  not  only held the tractof land of which the Manor consisted, but ruled it,exercising  direct political power  over his  tenants andretainers who were its  inhabitants.   This manorialsystem was practically at one time universal through-out England, so  that probably  every   rood  of  landformed part  of  some  manor; and it was this whichconstituted the real feudal system of government and land tenure, of  which scarcely a  trace  now remains.The modern system of landlord and tenant under a leaseor a tenancy from year to year at a rent (with all duedeference to politicians who assume the contrary), hasnot, and never has had, anything to do with feudalism,and took its rise in an  entirely different way, as 1 shallshew  later on.   The Lord of  a  Manor had, of course, to provide forthe performance of his duties to his overlord, and also for the cultivation of the soil.  This he did by  &quot;sub-infeudating&quot;  portions of  the  Manor to  sub-tenants for life, or, more usually, in fee simple.    In most largeManors some lands  were infeudated on terms  of mili-tary service,  and other lands for services in money orin kind or  in labour, such as ploughing  so many acres of the Lord&apos;s land, and the like (called common socagetenure).    These tenants (whether military or socage)were  the  freehold  tenants  of  the  Manor, and  the essence of  this freehold  tenure was  that their  services were  fixed&apos; and certain (c).   Then some of the rougher land was allocated as the waste or  Common of the  Manor not common  (asignorant persons sometimes pretend) to  all  the public but common to the Lord and his tenants for certaindefined purposes,  such as grazing of cattle, cutting ofturf for fuel, and the like.   The property, however,remained in the Lord.   Finally, the Lord appropriated  certain lands for hisown  occupation,  called  the &quot;demesne  lands&quot;  of  theManor; and these  included for a long period the villagesand cottages occupied by the villeins or serfs who werenot freemen, as to  whom I shall have something tosay further on, and who were the precursors of the modern copyholder.   Now, this state of affairs was obviously  inconsistent with absolute ownership, and consequently we find two things: First, a tenant of the Crown could not sell hisposition  so as to  substitute another man  as tenant ofthe King without the King&apos;s concurrence; and secondly,   (c) Speaking roughly, there  are but few  freehold tenants of manorsleft, by reason of a Tule that,  in the absence of evidence to the con-trary, every freeholder is supposed to hold  direct  of the  Crown,coupled with  the loss of such evidence with regard to trivial services which  have been allowed to fall into abeyance.  Still, occasionallyone meets with freeholds held of a manor where  by  ancient customa heriot was  claimable by the  Lord on the death of a tenant, whichhas had the  effect of  preserving the evidence of  the tenancy.  Forinstance, of which, reference may be made to Cnficstnke  v.  Hofirr,(u,oS)  2 Ch.  10.
146&quot;issue (if any were) had died,&quot; it was therefore enactedthat thenceforth &quot; the will of the giver according to the&quot; form in  the deed of gift manifestly expressed should&quot; be observed; so that they to whom the land was given&quot; under such condition  shall have no power to alien&quot; the land so given but that it shall remain unto thi&quot; issue of  them to whom it was given after their death&quot;or shall revert unto  the  giver or his heirs if issue&quot; fail,&quot; and so on.   This Statute was the first to complicate our law ofland tenure, for it invented a new statutory estate, ever since known as an  &quot; estate tail,&quot; which had the effectof preventing freehold lands granted in conditional feefrom being either sold or subinfeudated for longer thanthe life of the tenant  for  the  time being; and theseestates tail descended for some 200 years from father toson without any possibility  of the entail being broken.   The attack thus made on both alienation and sub-infeudation was, however, plainly insufficient, as it didnot touch the great multitude of freehold  tenants who held in  fee  simple absolute : and  consequently  thesecond great Real Property Act, known to lawyers asthe Statute of  Quia  Emplores, was  passed  shortly afterwards in the year 1290.   By this Act, which is also  in force  to the present day, it was recited that divers freehold tenants of greatmen and  other Lords  had sold their lands and tene-ments to be hoklen  in fee of themselves and not of thechief  lord of the  fee, &quot; whereby the same lords  have&quot; many  times lost their escheats, marriages,  and ward-&quot; ships of  lands and tenements belonging to their fees ;&quot; which thing seemed very hard and extreme unto those&quot; lords and other great men, and moreover in this case&quot; manifest disinheritance,&quot; it  was  therefore  enactedthat from henceforth it should be lawful for every free-man to sell at  his  own  pleasure his lands and tene-ments or part of them  so that the purchaser should hold the same  of the lord of the same fee by such servicesand customs as the vendor held them.  In case of thesale of part only,  the  services were to be  apportioned.Alienation in Mortmain was  prohibited,  and the Actwas expressly confined to estates in fee simple.   This was an epoch-making Act.  After it was passed,subinfeudation of freeholds in  fee simple became im-possible, and as a  corollary no new Manors could be created.   It crystallized  the existing  feudal relations,and prohibited any further extension of them. Whether&quot; the  great men  and  other  lords&quot;  who passed  theStatute quite realised  its effect may  be doubted; forwhile it always secured a tenant who  owed servicesdirectly to themselves, it must  have shattered the ideaof homage and fealty, the personal political relation ofLord  and  tenant,  which  was  the very foundation offeudalism.   The Statute Quia Emplores made freehold tenanciesin  fee  simple saleable free  from  the  rights  of thevendors&apos; heir, although, curiously enough, subject tohis widow&apos;s right to dower (i.e., to have a life estate inone-third of his lands).  This right was ultimately ableto be barred by a collusive action called a fine.- Subjectto the widow&apos;s dower when not so barred;  the power&apos;of disposing of lands by will crept in by a side wind; viz.,by the invention of &quot; uses,&quot; as to which I shall say soriie-thing further on.   Thus matters stood down to somewhere about thereign  of   the  4th  Edward,  when  the &quot;CommonRecovery &quot; was either invented or newly applied to the conversion of estates tail into estates in fee  simple.  this seems to have been  evolved from a more ancient devicecalled a &quot;fine.&quot;   &quot;Fines&quot; had for a long  time been  in use  to  barthe inchoate or expectant right to  dower of a married woman contingently upon  her  surviving her husband.She could not do this herself, being under  coverture (ordisability).  But she could do it by a compromise of afictitious action by leave of the King&apos;s Justices.   Sucha compromise was called a &quot; fine,&quot; because it made anend of  the  action,  and, although sufficiently  absurdaccording  to modern  notions, yet,  as  the wife was represented, it was not in substance open  to any graveobjection.  But the &quot;Common  Recovery&quot; was a far more audacious invention, for although the heirs of the body of a  tenant in  tail might be barred (like a widow)by a fine, the latter  was useless to bar the  reversionaryinterest of the original donor in tail in the event of failure of  heirs of the body of the tenant in tail.  Theobject  of  the Common  Recovery  was  to evade  theStatute  de donis conditionalibus (supra),  so as to barthis right  of reverter,  and to  enable  one who  was87071)2no tenant in fee simple could  dispose of his tenancyby will,  for it was given to him and  his line  of des-cendants  for  ever.   On his death the tenancy-thefeudal relationship to his Lord-descended on his heir,i.c., his eldest son if he had one, subject to his widow&apos;right  to  dower (i.c,  to a life  estate in  one-third), ofwhich he could no  more deprive her  than  he coulddeprive  his heir of his  right to inherit.    Whether a tenant of an intermediate Lord could  sell his positionas tenant without that  Lord&apos;s  consent is a matter of doubt.  Probably the bettor  opinion is that  it  depended on circumstances, and that the Lord&apos;s consent was onlyrequired when the change was of  such  magnitude thatthe substitution of a poor man for a rich one or the likemight injure the Lord;  or,  possibly, like the majorityof modern leases  for terms of years,  the  grant wascoupled with a condition requiring the Lord&apos;s consent to any alienation.   But however  this may have been, a  freehold  tenant,whether holding direct  from the  Crown or not, couldundoubtedly subinfeudate his holding,  but the person to whom he subinfeudated was his tenant and  not hisLord&apos;s  tenant.    This  method  was widely  practisedthroughout   England  towards  the   middle  of  thethirteenth century.   About that period, however,  the chains of feudalismwere getting rusty, and money payments were  largelytaking  the  place  of personal  military  service.  Thegreat Lords who were  tenants in chief seem towardsthe end of the thirteenth century  to have awakened tothe fact that their interests  were  far more  endangeredby unlimited subinfeudation than by  free  transfer oftheir tenants&apos; freehold estates.  A tenant could subin-feudate the  whole of his land and disappear with the proceeds, leaving the land in the possession  of a man who was not the tenant of his Lord, and to whose fealtyand homage the Lord had  no  claim.   In particular, a very profitable perquisite of a lord was to farm for his own personal benefit the propertyof an infant heir, and to arrange for his own benefit the marriage of a female heir,  and these rights,  of course,only attached to the heirs of his own  tenant and notto the heirs of the latter&apos;s sub-tenant.   It  is  true thatthe Lord could take the  benefit of  the services due fromthe latter to the  former;  but, as they  were  not  in-frequently nominal  (the subinfeudation  being madereally by way of sale for a  price  in money),  the Lordgot little satisfaction out of  the few peppercorns whichwere the services to be rendered to his own  man.  this may possibly have led to  the grant of  what  was thenknown  as a fee  simple  conditional, viz.,  a  subinfeuda-tion to a man and  the heirs of his body  either generally or by a particular wife, the land to revert to  the grantorin default of such  issue.  The Royal Courts,  however,who  were then  (as  they  have  always been) stronglyaverse to the creation of perpetuities, insisted that thecondition attached to such  a fee was  performed once for all when a  child was born capable  of inheriting,even if  it died the next hour, and that thereupon the tenancy  became a fee  simple.   This  led  to the firstgreat Real  Property Statute  known  as the  Statutede donis conditionalibits in the year 1285.   By this celebrated Statute it is recited as follows :    &quot; First concerning lands  that many  times  are given&quot; upon a condition ; that is to wit,  where any giveth his&quot; land to any man and  his  wife, and  to the heirs be-&quot; gotten of the  bodies of the same man and his wife&quot; with such  condition expressed that if the same man&quot; and his wife die without heirs of their bodies between&quot;them begotten, the  land so given shall revert to the&quot; giver or his heir : In case also where one giveth lands&quot; in free marriage,  which  gift hath  a  condition an-&quot; nexed though it be  not expressed in the deed  of gift,&quot; which is this, that  if the husband and wife die with-&quot; out  heir of their bodies begotten the land so given&quot; shall revert to the  giver  or  his heir : In  case also&quot;where one giveth land to  another, and the heirs of&quot; his  body issuing;  it  seemeth  very  hard  and yet&quot; seemeth to the givers and their heirs that  their will&quot; being  expressed in the gift was not heretofore nor yet&quot;  is observed.  In all cases aforesaid after issue begotten&quot; and born between them to whom the lands were given&quot; under  such  condition  heretofore such feoffees  had&quot; power  to alien the land so given  and to  disinherit&quot; their issue contrary to the minds of the  givers and&quot;  contrary to the form expressed in the gift,  and further&quot; when  the issue of such feoffee is failing  the  land so&quot; given  ought  to  return to  the  giver  or his heir by&quot; form of the gift expressed in the  deed,  though the
tenant in tail to enlarge that restricted statutory estateinto a fee simple absolute.  This was done in a way which, to a modern man, is suggestive of comic opera.   It  was essentially (a), in its simplest form, a pre-tended action by a collusive plaintiff against the tenantin tail for  recovery  of possession  of  the  land.   Thetenant in tail pleaded (quite untruly) that he had boughtthe lands from a third party,  usually the Crier of theCourt, who had warranted the title,  and asked thatthat person should  be &quot;vouched to  warranty,&quot; i.e.,called on to defend the action.  The Crier admitted hisliability-but  made  default.   Thereupon  judgmentwas given that the lands be surrendered to the nominalplaintiff, and  that the Crier  should  convey lands of equal value to the  tenant in tail  for an estate tail,which he was, of course, incapable of doing.   In the simplest cases a  single &quot; voucher &quot; was deemed  suffi-cient; in  others  a  double   voucher  was  required.Hamlet  has put into  his  mouth  a reference to  this procedure when he soliloquises : &quot; This fellow might be&quot; in&apos;s  time a great buyer of land, with  his Statutes, his&quot; recognizances,  his fines, his  double  vouchers, his re-&quot; coveries.   Is this the fine of his fines and the recovery&quot; of his recoveries to  have his fine pate full of fine dirt?&quot; Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases,&quot; and  double ones too, than the length and breadth  of&quot; a  pair of  indentures.&quot;   The  process of common recovery was  described bythe Attorney-General in 1833  (when it was abolished)as &quot; involving  enormous and unnecessary expense, and&quot; necessitating the conduct of proceedings through no&quot; less  than  twenty offices, in each of which danger,st delay,  and expense had to be faced.&quot;    In the meantime  ecclesiastical lawyers had inventedthe device called &quot; a use,&quot; the original sanction for whichwas spiritual  terror.   Whatever may have been the origin of &quot; uses&quot; (thepredecessors of the modern trusts), there  is no doubtthat,  at an early stage, they were resorted to (on the analogy of  the Roman law of fidei  commissa)  as a means of disposing  of real estate by will.  The pro-perty  was either granted or subimeudated to a friend of  the would-be  testator,  who  undertook  to hold  it&quot; to the use&quot; of  the  grantor for his life, and after  his death to the use of such person or persons as he should nominate by will.  The Courts of Law steadily refusedto recognise these uses, and they were evidently notori-ously created  for some time  before  even the Courtsadministering  Equity interfered;  for there is a complaint of the Commons that many feoffees  to uses (trusteesas  we should now  call them) alienated  and chargedthe property confided  to them, for which they statedthere  was  no  remedy.   However, a remedy was in-vented by John Waltham, Bishop of Salisbury and LordKeeper  in  the reign  of Richard  II., who invented theChancery writ of subpoena.  By this writ a trustee was liable to be summoned into the King&apos;s Chancery, andcompelled  to  answer  on  oath the allegations of the beneficial claimant, and to do justice,  failing which hewas incontinently laid by the heels  until he obeyed.The Chancery Court recognised the feoffee to uses  asthe legal  owner  with  legal rights against the entireworld rights  in rem as we call them but made himperform  his trust under  pain of  imprisonment,  i.e.,treated the rights of the beneficiaries  as rights in per-sonam.   Hence  arose  that collateral system  of Equityas opposed to  Common Law which remained quite dis-tinct  down to  the Judicature Act,  1873, when jurisdic-tion was given to all  Courts  to administer both Lawand Equity.    Protection  having been given by the Chancellor  touses,  it is said that  half the lands in the kingdom be-came vested in &quot; feoffees to uses&quot;-i.e., in trustees.   Inthe words  of  an ancient  lawyer, &quot;the parents  of the&quot; use  were  Fraud and Fear, and  a  Court of Conscience&quot; was the Nurse.&quot;    By the  reign of Henry VIII. the institution of useshad become so popular that the great Barons again tookalarm, and  in 1536 was passed the celebrated &quot;statute of  Uses,&quot;  which&apos; has  (doubtless quite contrary to itsauthors&apos; intention) introduced into the law of real pro-perty more pedantic quibbles and  absurd distinctionsand rules  than  any other English Statute.  It com-mences with a preamble setting forth that whereas  by&quot; the  common laws of this realm lands, tenements and&quot;hereditaments  be not devisable  by  testament, nor&quot;ought to be transferred from one to another but  by&quot;solemn livery  and  seizing, matter of  record, writing   (a)  I say  &quot; essentially&quot; for simplicity&apos;s sake.  Technically,  theaction  was much more round-about and fictitious.&quot;made buna  fide without covyno or fraud,  yet nevcr-&quot; theless  dyverse  and sundry  imaginations  subtle  in-&quot; ventions and practices  have been used whereby the&quot; hereditaments of this realm have been conveyed  from&quot; one to another  by fraudulent feoffments, etc., craftily&quot;made to secret uses intents  and trusts, and also by&quot; wills  and testaments sometime made by nude words,&quot; sometime by signs  and  tokens and  sometime  by&quot; writing, and for the most part made by such persons&quot; as be visited by sickness, in their extreme agonies and&quot; pains, or at such time as they have had scantlye any&quot; good  memory or remembrance; at which  times they&quot; being  provoked by greedy covetous persons lying in&quot; wait about  them, do many  times dispose indiscretely&quot;and unadvisedly their  lands  and  inheritances; by&quot; reason whereof divers and many heirs have been un-&quot; justly  at sundry times  disinherited,  the  lords  have&quot; lost their wards, marriages, reliefs, heriots, escheats,&quot; aydes  pur fayre fitz chyvaler &amp; pur file maryer, and&quot; scantlye any person can be certainly assured of any&quot; lands by them purchased, nor knowing surely against&quot; whom they shall use their actions or executions for&quot; their rights titles and  duties.&quot;  After  proceeding inthis strain at considerable length, the Statute enactedthat &quot; for the extirpyng and extinguyshment of all such&quot; subtle practices&quot; where any person should stand seisedof lands  or  hereditaments  to the use, confidence, ortrust of  another in fee simple, fee tail for  life,  or for years or  otherwise,  such latter persons  should bedeemed  to be in lawful  seizing and possession of suchlands,  etc.,  for  such  like estates as they had in use,trust, or confidence of or in the same.   Notwithstanding the  brave words  of the preambleas to the frauds practised on the King&apos;s more humblesubjects, it is pretty evident that the real object of theAct was to  prevent those subjects getting rid of theirlegal  duties  to their  immediate  lords.    It cannot besupposed, however, that  the authors of the Act realisedwhat the Courts very soon  made plain, viz., that inaddition to  the old fee simples  and life estates  of theCommon Law,  and the old statutory estate  tail, thisAct  enabled all  sorts of  shifting  ownerships  to be created by means of uses which the Statute immediatelyconverted into corresponding legal estates  in rem in place of the  former beneficial interests in personam.   This Statute  is at the bottom, of the complicationof modern English land  titles.  By its aid the modern&quot; strict  settlement&quot; of  land was made possible; andwhereas copyholds, leaseholds, and chattels have alwaysbeen held to be outside the  Statute, and incapable ofbeing settled on persons in succession by means of it,freehold land has  ever since  been capable of being tied up in a tangle of partial and contingent legal interests,which has rendered the  title to it incomprehensible to anyone but skilled real property lawyers, and for somecenturies rendered land  almost  inalienable.   In  particular,  the Statute enabled A. to  have the usufruct of land,  subject to a power given to B. whohad no estate or interest in it to deprive him of it andsell it  to another.   This Act was not at first popular, as it at once stopped the power of disposing of lands by will; for a grant by A. to B. to such uses as A. might appoint,  and subject thereto to the use of A., immediately by virtue of the Act, revested the estate in A.   So loud was the outcry, that five years after  the Act became law,  a  fresh Act had to be passed (1541), by which everyone having free- hold lands in socage  tenure was empowered to dispose thereof by will &quot; at his free will and pleasure.&quot;   This latter Act led to extraordinary consequences; for it was held  that  these wide words empowered the testator to do by will  at Law everything which he could have done in Equity before the Statute of Uses by means of a use; and as a corollary that he could create future legal interests by will  without a use, which he could only do by deed inter vivos with the aid of a grantee to uses. Moreover, it was subsequently held that, as before the Statute  of Uses a man  could by means of a use in  a will create future interests in leaseholds, enforceable in a Court of Equity,  the Statute of Wills enabled him by will  to create future legal  (as distinguished  from trust)  interests  in leaseholds, although by deed inter vivos he could only create corresponding equitable in- terests by means of a trust.    Here we  surely have technicality  in excelsis.   The Statute of Uses and the Statute  of Wills, in  point of fact, became  instruments for  creating a  tangle of limited  ownerships in rem unknown to the  Common Law.  Moreover, the very object of the Statute of Uses was soon defeated, for the  Courts  held that there  could not be &quot; a use upon
&quot; a use,&quot; and  that under  a conveyance to A. and  hisheirs to the use of B. and his heirs to the use of C. andhis heirs,  the  Statute vested the legal fee in B. once for all, and was  spent in the effort, and  that C.&apos;s in-terest was merely that of a beneficiary under a trust.The  old equitable uses, the destruction of which  wastho sole object of the authors of the Statute,  conse-quently reappeared under the modern name of  trusts,and have been extended  to all  kinds of property.   Lastly,  the Statute of Uses incidentally enabled!.?.r.d to be conveyed secretly by deed.   Up to its date the only way of conveying land was by feoffment withlivery of seizing.   The parties and their neighbours meton, or in sight of, the land, and in the presence of  all,formal delivery of seizing  or possession was made pub-licly  by the  vendor to the purchaser.   After the Statute, all that the vendor had  to do wasto declare that he held the land to the use of the  pur-chaser in  fee  simple, and thereupon  the Statute  ofUses vested the legal estate in  the purchaser.   This was stopped by the Statute of Enrolments; but this  again was evaded by the  invention of the  &quot; lease and  release&quot; which was the common method of  con- veyance for nearly 300 years (down to 1845), and en- tirely depended for its efficacy  on  the Statute of Uses. In fact, this Statute has been responsible for  almost all the intricacies of Real Property  Law.   By  the  sixteenth century  the  feudal  system had become moribund. Knighfs service had almost univer- sally been commuted for small quit rents, and only thecasual incidents of feudality wardship and enjoyment of the estate of an infant heir the sale in marriage of a female heir and in the case of tenants in chief the fines payable to the King on alienation-kept it alive; and  in the reign  of Charles II. the coup de grace was given to it by the abolition of all feudal incidents and military tenures  and the conversion of all fee  simple lands into socage tenure.                       *   In the mean-time, however, during, or just prior  to, the Commonwealth,  Sir  Orlando Bridgeman (one  of our  greatest Real Property counsel)  had invented the modern strict  settlement of freehold land which prevails to the present day.  By this system, which was  in- tended to defeat  the cutting off of entails by a common recovery, a settlor who  is entitled in fee simple con- veys the  land to A. (generally  his solicitor) and his heirs to the use that his (the settlers) wife may  receive a small rent charge by way of pin money during his life, and, subject thereto, to the use of himself for life, with remainder to the use of trustees for a  long term (500 or 1,000 years) upon trust by mortgage or  sale, if necessary, of that term to raise a fixed sum as portions for his younger  children, and  also to pay his widow a jointure or rent  charge  of a  fixed amount during her life, and  subject as above to  the use of the settlor&apos;s first  and other sons  successively  in order of seniority in tail male,  with remainder to them in  tail general, with divers other remainders in  favour  of daughters and collateral relations,  with an  ultimate  remainder to the use of  the settlor himself in fee simple.  When an eldest  son  comes of age, he is approached, and  it is put  to him  that,  if he will bar his estate tail and cut it down to an estate for life&apos;, with remainder to his  first and other sons successively in tail male, etc., his father will grant him an immediate rent charge to last during the  father&apos;s life.  The  son  invariably consents,  and thus down  to 1882 the great entailed estate  were prac- tically made inalienable, because directly  a next tenant in tail in remainder attained twenty-one he was induced to cut himself down to a life estate only, and so put it out  of his power to bar the entail, by means, originally, of a common recovery, and, since 1833, by an enrolled deed.    In order to put an end  to the fetters imposed by strict settlement,  the  Settled  Land  Act,  1882,  was passed, a Statute which has practically rendered settled land freely saleable and largely capable of being leased. The broad  policy on which  the Settled Land Act  was founded was  (in the words  of  the  late  Lord  Justice Chitty (d)) to &quot;render land a marketable article  not- &quot; withstanding the settlement.   Its  main  purpose is &quot; the welfare of the land itself,  and of all interested &quot; therein, including the  tenants.  The scheme adopted &quot;is to facilitate the striking off from the land of fetters &quot; imposed by settlement; and this is accomplished by &quot; conferring  on  tenants for life  in  possession,  and &quot; others considered to stand in  a like relation to  the &quot; land, large  powers of  dealing with it by  way  of &quot; sale, exchange, lease and otherwise, and by zealously   (d) Re Mundy and Ropei&apos;s Contract (1899), L. R.  1 Ch. 275.&quot; guarding those powers from  attempts to defeat them&quot; or fetter their exercise.   At the same time the rights&quot; of persons claiming under the  settlement are care-,&quot; fully preserved in the case of a sale, by shifting the&quot; settlement from  the land to the  purchase money,&quot; which  has to be paid into Court or into the hands of&quot; trustees.   The money so  paid  can be applied  in  a&quot; variety of ways for the extension of the property or the&quot; release of incumbrances, or can  be invested in securi-&quot; ties, according to the direction of the tenant for life,&quot; or may be applied in the execution  of permanent im-&quot; improvements.  The Act also contains  elaborate clauses&quot; for the working  out of the general idea, and, speak-&quot; ing broadly, may be said to give the tenant for life or&quot; other limited owner powers of management  as large&quot; and varied as those of an  absolute owner, but mak-&quot; ing provision  for safeguarding capital money arising&quot; from the sale  of settled land.&quot;   But this Act, although  a  great one, did not simplifyeither the law or titles to land, but  only extended thepowers  of limited owners; and, where a sale of settledland is  made,  the  purchaser has  not  only to trace thehistory  of  the  ownership  for  forty years,  but has towade through a long settlement (or  more frequently,a chain of long settlements)&apos;to ascertain whether the vendor  is the  tenant for  life, and if so who (if any)are the  trustees to whom  the purchase money must bepaid.        Origin  and History: of Copyholds.   And now a  few words  as to the second class oitenures, known  in  modern  times  as  copyhold,  butanciently as villein or unfree tenure.  As I have already pointed out (p. 26), the Lord of a Manor had to provide accommodation for the class of unfree labourers knownas serfs or villeins, the origin of which is as obscure asthe rights of their Lord.    It is  a  mistake to regard them as slaves in the modern sense.  They appear tohave been villagers (whence villein),  rooted to the soil,and bound to  perform such reasonable,  but quite un-fixed services  as  the Lord might  require of  them,heerin differing from freeholders, whose services were fixed and  certain.  But as regards all the world excepttheir  Lord  they  were in  the same  position as free-men.  Not  being  freemen qua their  Lord,  they couldnot be freeholders indeed,  a  grant of land by a lord to his serf in fee  simple appears to  have enfranchisedhim ipso facto.   As,  however, the Lord neither fed nor clothed  hisvilleins  nor paid them wages,  they had to be sustained by the fruits of their own  labour on parts of the Lord&apos;sdemesne  allotted  to them for that  purpose.  To this allotment (by  no  means  small (e))  and to his cottage the villein  was admitted &quot; at the will of  the Lord,&quot;i.e. as  tenant  at will.    But  when  he  died  someone had to  succeed him, and  a  custom grew up  naturally to make some provision for his  widow, and  to admit one of  his sons  as  his  customary   heir.     In  some Manors the Common Law was followed, and the eldest son was  deemed  the customary heir in  others  the youngest son  was chosen  for reasons somewhat  ob- scure;  and yet again in  others  all  the  sons  were  ad- mitted  as tenants in coparcenary  (i.e.  in  common). Again,  the  right of a tenant&apos;s widow to dower (called freebench) differed, and still differs, in various manors. Sometimes she takes half  or even the whole  of  the lands  for  life,  in others one-third, in  some during widowhood and chastity, in  others  apart  from these qualifications,  and in others  again  she may take  her one-third in fee.  Further, her  right may depend on whether she was  the first, second, or third wife.  Un- like freehold dower, she  was not,  until 1833, entitled to freebench out of an equitable estate, but only where her husband  was actual tenant on  the Court Rolls, unless  he succeeded as  heir and  died before  admit- tance.    Again, a copyholder  is  restricted in his powers of leasing to leases  for one year, and is restrained from committing waste, and, in either case, forfeits his land unless he has  got the Lord&apos;s license, which is  not given for nothing.    In every case  a person seeking admission to copy- holds,  whether as heir,  devisee or purchaser, has to come to the Lord&apos;s Court and pray  admission, and in general had,  and still  has, to pay the Lord a  fine  sometimes  fixed by custom,  and sometimes  arbitrary  and to  pay the  Steward a fee, and to do fealty;  and on death a heriot (the earliest form of death duty)-   (a) Many times in  excess of  the &quot; three acres and a  cow &quot; which was so fashionable in political circles some years ago.
 generally the tenant&apos;s best beast or best chattel-is due to the  Lord.  In later ages, when Court  Rolls  were kept, his title was the entry on the Court Roll, and a copy of it  being handed  to  him  the tenure became known as copyhold.   In its inception the tenure was tenancy at will.  By custom it came to be considered a  gross hardship for the  Lord to refuse  to admit a customary heir,   and ultimately the custom of admission, having been con- tinuecl for centuries, was declared by the King&apos;s Court to bebindinginlaw, and, if the Lord refused admission, the prerogative writ of mandamus could be claimed to compel him to admit  on payment of the customary fine.   Thus, copyhold became  a recognised estate of inheritance, and, with the exception that copyholds can now be compulsorily enfranchised and  turned into  free- holds in fee simple, and that no particular form of dis- posing of them  by  will is now required,  the law of copyholds remains the same  as above to the present day.   But,  although originally only deemed lit for serfs, copyholds have for many  centuries been tenanted by all  manner of men,  even the  highest of the King&apos;s subjects.  I  know of an instance where the  modern Lord of the Manor was trie local ironmonger, and one of his copyhold tenants  a peer  resident in the neigh- bourhood.   Neither the Statute de donis  nor the Statute of Uses applies to copyholds; so that, without the intervention of a  trust,  and in the absence of special  custom to create an estate tail,  they can only  be settled so as to create (i)  a life  estate, and (2)  a fee  simple absolute, or (3) a conditional fee (p. 27) to takeeffecCon the death of the life tenant; and a conditional fee  in the hands of a  childless  tenant  cannot, like  an estate  tail,  be barred.   Generally, copyhold tenure is the last shadow of the feudal system.    It  is entirely  and hopelessly out of date, an irritating nuisance, and ought to be destroyed without benefit of clergy.        ORIGIN AND  HISTORY OF LEASEHOLDS.   In  the thirteenth  century-the century which  pro- duced the  Statutes   de  donis  and quia emptores  another statutory  estate in land  was invented,  viz., an estate for years.   At  Common Law an interest limited  to a term of years did not confer any  estate (i.e., right  in  rem) in the land.  Between the lessor and the  lessee there was only the relation of contracting  parties, with the result that,  if the lessee was  evicted by the lessor, his remedy was  to recover damages for breach of contract, or, if by a third party, to recover damages for tort.  But as feudalism died out, commercialism grew up; and men, anxious to make  a living by  agriculture, preferred to take farms  for terms of years at money rents, rather than become feudal  freehold tenants.   As has usually happened  in  England, an ounce of practice was considered better than  a pound of theory, and the free man  put  his pride  in his  pocket and was content to take a lease founded  entirely on contract.   Then, when the inconvenience of the tenant having no right  in rem  became  acute,  a statute was passed known  as the  Statute of Gloucester (1278),  by which a lessee for years was placed in possession of an &quot; estate&quot; a right in rem good  as against the whole world, and this was subsequently  extended  by  another  statute, 21 Henry VIII. c. 15.   Now there is no limit to the  length of the  term forwhich an estate for years may  be granted,  so  long as the term is  mentioned.  It may be for one  year, or itmay be for  fifty thousand years it may be at a  rentpayable to a lessor, or it may be  as free from rent as anestate in fee simple.   An  estate  for, say, ten thousandyears free of rent is, in point of dominion, indistinguish-able  from an  estate in fee  simple; but it is widelydifferent in  its legal incidents.   In the first  place,  it devolves on  death exactly like a chattel, or money,  or stocks, and  hence it is called a&quot; chattel real.&quot;  Primogeniture has no part in it.   It is merely a portion of a deceased owner&apos;s personal estate, and, if he dies intestate, is  distributed  in accordancewith the Statute  of Distribution in  precisely the same way  as his money, his furniture, his stocks and shares,or his cattle.   In the second place, the  legal  ownership  is  notcapable (like freeholds) of being  cut  up into a series of successive interests.  The law only recognises an abso-lute owner of a term of years,  just as it only recognisesan absolute owner of  stocks  or shares.   The  statute of Uses does not apply to  it,  neither do the Statutesde donis conditionalibus or  quia emptores.   It  can,   therefore,  only  be  settled on  personsin succession by  means of a  trust,  just like stocks and   shares.   For  the   same   reason   it  cannotbe  made   the   subject  of  an  estate tail  so   asto pass in   a  course  of  strict primogeniture.   Anyattempt, even by way of a trust, to entail a term  ofyears  has the effect of vesting the term absolutely inChe first person who would, if it were freehold, be  thefirst  tenant  in tail.   On  the other  hand,  the  Statute quia emptores  notapplying to  estates for years, a term is capable of beingsubleased.   It will be seen, therefore, that an estatefor a term, say of 20,000 years, has much simpler legalincidents than an estate in fee simple,  the legal owner-ship  in the  entire term being  always vested in  someone either as beneficial owner or as trustee.    THE PRESENT CHAOTIC  STATE  OF THE  LAW.   Pausing   for  a moment here, it will be seen thatthings have got  fairly  complicated.  There are  threecollateral systems  of landholding:   (1)  the ancientpatched  up  and  incongruous freehold system, (2)  thestill more out of date copyhold system,  and (3) the more modern leasehold system.   The freehold  fee simple and the copyhold  fee  areholden for ever, but the chattel real may be holden for50,000 years, which  is  surely as nearly  for ever as isattainable.  Yet)  these  three  kinds of ownership,  sonearly alike in  the matter  of  the  holder&apos;s dominionover  the land, were, and still are, vastly different withregard&apos; to settlement and devolution on death intestate.   And this  difference with regard to  devolution leads to an  additional complexity  known  to lawyers   as&quot;equitable conversion.&quot;  If a man by his will directshis real estate to be sold, and Che proceeds divided between A.  and B.,  and B. dies in the  testator&apos;s life-time, there is a lapse of B.&apos;s share; and the question atonce arises to whom B.&apos;s moiety of the purchase moneybelongs.  It is settled that, in  that simple case, it is payable to the testator&apos;s heir, and does not devolve aspart  of his  personal estate.   For the direction to con-vert  into  money  was merely for the  purposes of  the will, and, so far as these purposes have failed, the heiris not  to be disinherited in favour  of the next of kin.But  if the heir happens to die intestate between  the dates of the testator&apos;s death and the actual  sale, whotakes B.&apos;s moiety then?  Does it go to the heir&apos;s heir,or to his next of  kin as personal estate?  Much litiga-tion  and fine-drawn distinctions  have  accumulatedaround points such as these, all of which would vanishif freeholds devolved as chattels real do, viz., as personalestate.   Lastly, all this confusion is &quot; worse confounded&quot;  byconcurrent ownership in tenancy in common.   Here isan example  which recently  came  before  me  in  myofficial capacity.  A  man by his will devised his free-holds to the  use of his wife for life, and after her deathto the  use of his children in fee simple.  He had  tenchildren;  one of  them  died  during the widow&apos;s life,leaving a similar will,  seven children, and  a  widow.This is quite a simple example; yet the result is that a house  worth about   i$o per  annum is (the widowbeing dead)   now vested (not merely in  equity but atlaw)  in  seventeen  persons in the following propor-tions   Each of  the nine  living children of  testator     7     or their assigns     ............     70   Each of  the  seven children  of  the deceased     child,  subject to the prior life interest of     1     their mother   ...............     70Moreover, several of the parties have  mortgaged theirshares,  and  in  the result when the great expense ofproving the  title of each of the  seventeen  has been paid, a very small balance will remain for distribution.Thus,  tenancy  in common  is  (having regard to  theSettled Land Acts) a far greater detriment to the propermanagement of land than settlements (which are popu-larly  debited with this sin), and introduces infinitelygreater difficulty  with regard to its sale, as, (not onlymust the parties be unanimous,  but  the title of each ofthem  has to be deduced.   Now it is true that during the nineteenth  centurymany Acts were  passed which  have had the effect ofmaking it easier  to deal with land.  For instance,  theFines and Recoveries Abolition Act of T833 substituted simple enrolled deed  as the  method of barring anentail instead of the old  expensive and absurd CommonRecovery.   In the same vear the Dower Act enabled
a husband to sell his land free from his wifo&apos;s right todower without going through the analogous  farce of&quot; levying a fine.&quot;   In 1837 the Wills Act placed wills of real  estate on a  bettor footing.    The Real  PropertyAmendment Acts of the forties simplified conveyances,a process carried still further by the Conveyancing Act,1881; and finally  the Settled Land  Act of 1882 (thegreatest of all these tinkering statutes) placed tenantsfor life and others in analogous  situations (as  abovepointed out)  in the position of  trustees  for their suc-successors, and gave them statutory  powers  to  sell andconvey  the  property  absolutely,  and to grant  leasesbinding on their  successors  while  safeguarding  thematerial interests  of those  successors by causing pur-chase money to be paid either to trustees or into Court.   The difficulties of  tenancy  in  common  have alsobeen, to some extent, relieved  by  the Partition Acts,1868 and  1876, by giving the Court power in  a  parti-tion action to sell the property  at the  request of  amajority of the  owners.  But a partition  action is  an expensive luxury, and unfortunatelytenancy in  commonis  most usually found in the case  of small properties,with  the  result that sometimes the costs swallow  upthe whole value of the property.   But these statutes have  not simplified the law. Nay,they  have rather  added to its  complexity;  for,  whilepreserving all the old partial and limited legal estatesand interests  in full  force, they have merely enabledcertain persons  who  have  life  estates or  the like inpossession, to do  acts which  are binding on their suc-successors.   The three old collateral  systems,  therefore,  stillflourish side by  side without, as far as I can see, theleast advantage to anyone  except  persons  like myselfwho have spent a lifetime  in acquiring the  lean andwasteful learning which overlays them.   To show the absurdity of the thing, I myself  own a house standing  on about half  a  rood of land.   Thegreater part of the site  is freehold in fee simple; but afew square yards  of the kitchen  and the  dining-roomto the south of a  diagonal  line are held for a term of2,000 years at a peppercorn rent with a covenant to keep a wall in  repair (which  is now useless to anyone) and aproviso for re-entry on breach of that covenant.  were so foolish as to  die intestate, the greater part  of thehouse, would go to my heir subject, to my widow&apos;s rightto a life estate in one-third of it for her dower, whilethe leasehold part of the dining-room and kitchen  would go as  to one-third to my widow  absolutely and as to two-thirds to my next of kin.  What does that elusiveabstraction &quot;the  plain man&quot; think of that?  Surelyit is a reductio ad absurdum.   To show the differences in the  incidents of landholden under these three collateral systems respectively,the following  table has been compiled : (I.) With respect to  Dominion where the Land is not subject      to a Settlement.   (a) Freeholds. Tn  point  of  duration  held in per-petuity, in point  of dominion  unfettered,   subject toeasements in  favour of owners and occupiers  of otherlands and to any  rent  charges or quit rents.  Unlessexpressly  severed, the mines and  minerals belong tothe owner of  the  surface.   (b) Copyholds.-In  point of duration  the  same asfreeholds, but in point of extent the mines and  minerals and  trees  are vested in the Lord,  but he cannot work or cut them respectively without the tenanfs  consent.   (c)  Leaseholds. If held  for a long term (say 1,000vears and  upwards) at a peppercorn rent the dominionis  the same during the term as  freehold,  subject ofcourse to  express reservations.(II.)  With  respect to Sale, Mortgage, etc.  (a) Freeholds are conveyed  by simple deed  of  grant,and  are mortgaged and leased in  the  same way. the fee simple (i.e., the absolute ownership)  can onlv be conveyed  inter vivos  by a   conveyance &quot; to A. and hisheirs,&quot; or, since  1881, &quot;to A. in fee simple.&quot;   without these magic words the Donor onlv  takes a life interest,even  although the deed expressly  conveys it to him&quot;absolutely&quot; or &quot; for ever.&quot;  On  the other hand, in awill  no such  words are necessary surely an absurddistinction which  ought to  be abolished.   (b) Copyholds  can  only  be conveyed  by surrenderinto the hands of  the Lord, and admittance-by him ofthe purchaser as  the new  tenant,  the latter  paying a fine.   Mortgages  are made by conditional surrender.In both cases covenants for title  have to be  providedfor by a collateral deed.  Leases of copyholds execed-ing one year can only be made by consent of the Lord.   (c) Long Leaseholds are (practically) conveyed in thesame way as freeholds.  Where they are subject to rentor  onerous covenants they  are  usually  mortgaged byway of sub-lease, so as to free the mortgagee from per-sonal liability  for payment of the rent reserved by, andthe lessee&apos;s covenants  contained in, the lease.(III.) With  respect to  Testamentary  Disposition.   All three kinds of tenure now permit of land beingdisposed of by will.   Leaseholds always, and  freeholdssince 1897, vest in  the executor,  but copyholds stillpass direct to  the devisee.(IV.) With respect to  Intestacy.    (a) Freeholds since 1S97  vest in the administrator,in  trust (subject to  debts,  funeral and testamentaryexpenses, and to  widow&apos;s  dower,  or to a widower&apos;sestate by the  curtesy) for the heir  (eldest son,  if any;if  not, daughters equally; if none,  father, and so on).    (b) Leaseholds have  always vested in the  adminis-trator as part of general personal estate, subject todebts, funeral and testamentary expenses, in trust forthe widow (if any) and  next of kin absolutely, in the proportions specified  in the statutes for the distribu-tion of the personal estate  of intestates.    (c) Copyholds do not vest in the administrator at all,but pass direct to the customary heir, who has to payable fine on admission.   If they have to be sold for pay-ment of debts, a Chancery  suit  is frequently  necessaryto enable this to be done.(V.) With respect to Settlement inter vivos on Persons in      Succession.    (a) Freeholds can be,  and usually are,  settled by the aid of the Statute of  Uses (without the intervention ofa  trustee),  conferring a series of legal  partial  owner-ships on a  long sucession of persons for life and in tail,with intermediate long terms of  years vested in trusteesfor raising or securing jointures for widows  and por-tions for younger children.    (b) Copyholds can  only be settled effectively by vest-ing the entire legal ownership  in trustees, upon trustswhich must not include equitable estates  tail unlessthe custom of  the Manor so  permits.    (c) Leaseholds can only be settled at all by  vestingthe entire term in trustees upon the desired trusts; but here again an attempt to create an  equitable estate tailonly has the effect of vesting the land in equity abso-lutely for the term in  the  first person who  would betenant in tail if the land were  freehold.   In  all casesthe trustees are the legal owners with rights in rent;the interests of the beneficiaries are equitable only andenforceable in ficrsonam.(VI.) With respect to Settlement on Persons in  Succession      by Will.    (a) Freeholds can be,settled bv will, without the in-tervention  either of  a use,  or  of trustees, in precisely the same way as they can be settled with the aid of ;ause.  Such limitations .are  sometimes life estates  andremainders,  and  sometimes  divesting  and   shiftinglimitations called executory, devises.    (b) Copyholds.-There is great  difficulty  in effec-tively settling copyholds by will  except by means of the intervention of a trustee.    (c) Leaseholds.-By a curious anomaly, the origin ofwhich is obscure, although leaseholds cannot  be settledinter vivos without the intervention of a trustee, theycan, by will, be settled at law by means of an  executorybequest; but,  generally  speaking,  they are settled  bymeans of the  intervention of a trustee.                   The Remedy.    What, then, is the remedy for this state of things?Some may  say sweep away the whole of.the rubbishand commence de novo.  That is  a counsel of perfec-tion,  but  quite impracticable.   It would  require  an elaborate code of new law, every detail  of which wouldbe  criticised, and  perhaps opposed, and certainly mis-understood by lay minds, in its passage through Parlia-ment. Even the  most powerful Ministry would despairof getting  such a Bill passed into law.   The  next sug-gestionis to amend once more the law of freeholds andcopyholds as, for instance, by Lord Haldane&apos;s  Con-veyancing  of  Real Property Bills.   That would makethe law more reasonable,  but  assuredly  would not
simplify it.  It would be more technical than ever. Thethird plan, which I venture to think is,the line of leastresistance, is-   (i) To abolish  all the complexities and incidents oftwo  of the three  systems above  explained viz.,  the freehold and copyhold tenures, and to enact (in effect)that henceforth all land now held as freehold or copy-hold shall have precisely the same legal incidents as ifit were leasehold land holden for a term of, say, 100,000years at a peppercorn rent.   (2) To free purchasers from the present onus of in-vestigating  trusts; and   (3) Finally, to treat tenancy  in  common  (which,after all, is in effect a settlement for concurrent insteadof for successive interests)  in much  the  same way  as parliament has treated settled estates viz.,  by giving to some person, or a limited number of persons, all  thepowers conferred by the Settled Land Acts on a tenantFor life.  (I.)  As TO  THE  ASSIMILATION OF  FREEHOLDS AND             COPYHOLDS- TO LEASEHOLDS.  .   The first of these suggestions might take some such form as the following :         (1) From  and  after  the passing  of  this Act    every estate in fee simple or customary fee whether    freehold or copyhold (including estates subject  to    the customs of Gavelkind or  Borough English  or    other  local custom)&apos; and whether in possession,    reversion or  remainder shall for all  purposes  of    disposition, settlement  on persons in succession,    transmission, devolution (including the right of the    Crown  in relation to bona vacantia), distribution,    and administration of assets on death, have all the    incidents  of a  chattel real  estate,  save  only that    they shall continue in  perpetuity and not merely    for a term of years certain, and shall be called free-    hold estates in fee simple to  distinguish them from    estates  for years certain.        (2) Every  executory  devise  or bequest shall    take effect as a trust in Equity only, the trustees of    which shall be the executors or the administrator    with the will annexed of the testator.   That would do away, uno flatu, with all the com-plexities and anomalies of the  existing law of freeholdsand  copyholds;  would  abolish tenure and seizing andother dry bones of feudalism ; would render obsoletethe existing equitable rules as  to conversion as betweenheirs and  next of kin;  would simplify the administra-tion of assets on death; and would, at all  events, unifythe law of land;  and (except  in some few particularsdepending on  the inherent difference between land(which  is immovable)  and chattels  (which are move-able) ) would assimilate the law of property in land  tothe law of property in pure personal estate.   Some of my friends  have objected that this schemeis unscientific and  the invention of a rank opportunist.But our law is not scientific;  and a people which canpersuade itself with ease that it is noontide on a sum-mer&apos;s day when the sun still bears 15 degrees East  ofSouth is  not likely to object to  the enactment thatfreehold land shall  have all  the  incidents of a longleasehold  on the ground that  it  is unscientific.  More-over, would it be any more unscientific than abolishingour complicated system of weights and measures andsubstituting the metric system?(II.) As TO THE ABOLITION OF THE EQUITABLE  DOCTRINE               OF NOTICE OF TRUSTS.   The second of the  above  proposals might  be  ex-pressed thus:        No bond, fide purchaser  for value,  or  lessee,    who knows that the vendor or lessor is  acting  as    an express trustee shall be bound or  concerned  to    investigate the trust, but shall be entitled to  as-    some (unless he has actual knowledge to the con-    trary) that the vendor or lessor has full power and    authority to carry out the transaction and to give    a good receipt for the purchase money or rent, and    the remedy of any beneficiary shall be against the    trustee only.   This would greatly simplify titles; and, althoughat first sight it might shock some of my professionalbrethren,  it is, after all, what is winked at in the caseof mortgages on which trust funds are invested wherethe trust is invariably kept off the title : nay, is ignored,even  although a transfer of the  mortgage only bearsa IOS. stamp, which would be a wrong  stamp unlessthe transfer was being made to a new trustee (/). Thatwhich is the recognised practice in the case of a trustsecurity cannot surely be so very dreadful in the  caseof trust land.  Indeed, it is  much more easy to conceal(and therefore  to carry out) a fraud in the case  of a trust  security,  than  it is to  sell trust land,  as thechange of ownership of the land could not be concealedfor long.    Moreover, in the case  of trust stocks and shares nopurchaser has notice of trusts, and, although no doubtbeneficiaries can protect themselves by means of a dis-tringas notice, it  is  notorious that  not  one in tenthousand does so.              (III.) As TO  MORTGAGES.    The greatest difficulty in carrying  out my simplescheme of real property reform is the fact that land isfrequently  mortgaged by means of  a conveyance ofthe legal ownership (the legal estate in  fee simple, aswe lawyers call it) to the  lender, thus leaving the trueowner  with  an  equity  of  redemption only.   Inmy  opinion   and  in  that  of  other conveyancers,a   mortgage  by   conveyance  of  the fee  simpleought  to  be  prohibited,  and  if   a  legal  mort-gage   be   desired,   it  should  be  effected  by  thecreation of  a long  term of years  (which is a  legal estate), thus leaving the  legal fee simple in the mort-gagor subject to a legal  term  of, say, 2,000 years inthe mortgagee (g).   This would infinitely simplify theproblem of keeping equities off the title; for if the trueowner of land is to  be allowed to sell it  (as is essential)subject to a legal mortgage, all he has to sell at present is an  equitable interest;  and  therefore  it is futile tosay with regard to  such an interest,  that  equitiesshould be kept off the title.   Moreover,  the suggested changes would  have theadditional advantages of making  second and  subse-quent mortgages legal, instead of, as now, purely equitable-table,  for they could be  created by  a series of longterms, each a few days  longer than that which  pre-ceded it.   Thus, A.  the freeholder could  mortgage  (1) to B.for a term of 1,000 years; (2) to C.  for a term of 1,300years subject to B. &apos;s term; and (3) to D. for a termof 1,400 years subject to C.&apos;s term  of  1,300.   In sucha case all four persons would  have legal estates, withall  the protection  afforded  by  legal ownership.    Itwould also enable the proposed statute to be  drafted in terms which are familiar to all lawyers, instead ofin new phraseology like that of Lord Haldane&apos;s Bill-such   as  &quot;proprietary  estates&quot;   and  &quot;subordinateestates&quot; or &quot;permitted estates.&quot;  Lastly, it could beprovided that  on foreclosure or sale  the term shouldbe converted automatically into the fee simple.        (IV.)  As TO TENANCIES IN COMMON.   The third  suggestion gives  rise to  much  greater difficulty.   In  the case of settled land Parliament hasdetermined  that  the proper person  to  exercise thestatutory powers of sale and leasing, and, for certainpurposes,  of mortgaging,  is  the  man for&quot; the timebeing entitled to possession  or receipt of the rents and profits, and that,  so long  as  he  keeps  within thestatutory powers, no reversioner shall have any rightto interpose.   But in the case of tenancy in common, the beneficialinterests are concurrent and not successive, and how arewe to choose which  of the concurrent owners is  to havesimilar powers to those conferred by the Settled LandActs upon a tenant for life?    My view is that, if the  tenants in  common can begot to agree on the choice of one of their number, orof outside trustees,  they should (as now) be allowed todo  so; but that,  if they  fail to do so,  any tenant  in common whose beneficial interest  in  the income ex-ceeded (say) one-third, should have the right to nom-inate  the  Public Trustee as trustee  of the  property,and that thereupon the Public Trustee  should have allthe powers of a tenant for life under the Settled LandActs,  and should also be trustee of the notional settle-ment  for the  purposes of those Acts.    I would, however, provide  that, until called uponto exercise  the powers, the Public Trustee should notbe entitled to either capital or income fees.  I am aware that the above may  seem  somewhat  drastic; but  so   (/) See Re Chafers  and Randall&apos;s Contract, (1916)  2 Ch. 8,rind Re Sodcn and Alexanders  Contract, (1018) 2 Ch. 258.   Or) Suggested  by my friend,  Mr. C P. Sanger, of I.incoln&apos;s Inn.
 many evils result from tenancy in common, that I feel sure the above suggestion is really for the benefit of all concerned, and certainly would be less costly than the only existing form of relief, viz., an  action for parti- lion or sale by  the Court.  That procedure would,  in- deed, be entirely superseded, for every tenancy in  com- mon would, under the proposed Act, become subject to an overriding trust for sale of the entirety; and it has always been held that, where that is the case, the Court has no jurisdiction to sell or partition.  Incidentally, therefore, the Partition  Acts  could be  repealed,   and theChancery Judges  entirely relieved of one branch of their jurisdiction.    Although the above three suggestions constitute the main fabric of my  scheme,  there are several other  mat- ters which would  have to be dealt with in carrying it out.   (V.) As TO A  WIDOW&apos;S DOWER AND A WIDOWER&apos;S               ESTATE BY THE CURTESY.    In the first place,  if the law of freehold and copy- holds were assimilated to  that of leaseholds  without amendment of the latter, in the event of a man dying intestate  the widow, instead of  taking one-third of the lands for her life,  would become absolutely entitled to  one-third of the lands in  fee simple, or to  half if the deceased died  without  issue.   On  the  other hand, if a married woman  died  intestate  (whether with or without issue),  her widower  would become  absolutely entitled in fee simple  to  the whole of  her lands to the exclusion  of her children,  instead (as at present) of taking, at most, a life estate (&quot;estate by the curtesy)&quot; in  her freeholds.   Analogous results would take place with regard to copyholds.  The present state  of the law as to the rights of a  husband or wife on the death of the other intestate  is,  however, not likely to escape amendment, now that women  have votes; and what- ever amendment is decided  on  could readily be inserted in the proposed Act, and made applicable  to all kinds of  property.  I  would suggest   that  the  fait thing would be that a surviving spouse (whether husband or wife), should take a  life  estate in the  other&apos;s property on   intestacy; and also that  on  the death of an un- married child intestate its  property should be equally divided between its parents.   At present  the  father takes everything if he survives,  and if he be dead the mother takes no share in  the child&apos;s  real estate,  and only ranks as if she were  a sister in the personal estate.             (VI.)  As TO ESTATES TAIL.    Some,  possibly a  majority, of lawyers  will  con- sider that  inconvenience  would be created  by the  abo- addition  of estates  tail.  It is said  with  truth that  the estate tail provides for  the preservation of a  family estate in case of the lunacy of an infant tenant in tail in a way which is quite unique,  and this is, of course, accentuated in the case of  a  peerage or a baronetage where it  is always desirable that  the  family  estate Should go with the title.  In such cases an estate  tail, while nearly always  capable of  being turned  into a fee  simple by the  man in  possession  when of sound mind and full age,  automatically provides for the devo- lution on the settlor&apos;s male  issue and their issue in order of seniority,  unless  something  is done  by  the man in possession to stop it. Moreover, even if estates tail were abolished, it  would be possible (as now in. the case of leaseholds) to provide,  in a  roundabout  and technical way by ingenious  and complicated trusts, for muoh the same result, so long as one keeps within the rule as to perpetuities.  There  is, therefore,  a good deal to be said  for the continued existence of estates tail, or, at  all events, estates  in  tail male.   So be  it. I go further, and suggest that if estates tail be allowed in the case of land, why  not allow them in the case of pure personal estate,  particularly chattels and heir- looms?  The principle for  which I contend  is merely that there  ought to be one  law for both lands,  goods, and money so far as  their different  natures and  as policy of  the  Settled  Land Acts  permit.   If it is de- sired to retain estates tail, I  can see no  real reason why they should be forbidden  (as now) in  the  case of stocks and shares and long leasehold interests in land, while they are allowed in the case of capital moneysarising from the sale of settled land under the Settled Land Acts, and in  the case of  money directed to be invested in  the purchase  of land with power to post-pone the purchase.   At the same time, I think it wouldbe desirable to abolish the privilege (very rarely  met with in practice)  of appointing special  protectors  of a settlement, the only object of which is to put every     8707 obstacle in  the  way of the man in possession  cutting off the  entail,     Finally,  I  must point  out  that this  provision forms no necessary part of the proposed Bill.  Some persons (possibly a  majority) may be of the same opinion as a  member of  Lincoln&apos;s Inn who wrote a pamphlet on the subject  in 1641, in which he says, &quot;I could never &quot;after long  observation find any family continue in the &quot;hcircs  male,  four descents after an entaile made and- &quot;continued  to the heires male, by which.I guesse they &quot;are not watered by heavenly blessings.&quot;   (VII.) As TO SIMPLIFICATION OF TITLE TO SETTLED                        LAND.     It is conceded that the proposed conversion of free- holds and  copyholds  into perpetual leaseholds, while rationalising and  simplifying the  law, would  not by itself simplify (and as  a  corollary  cheapen) the prac- tice of conveyancing so far as settled property  is con- cerned,  because it would  still be necessary to investi- gate all  the  trusts of settlements so as to judge whether the person  who  is purporting  to  deal with the pro- perty is empowered to do so,  either under the provi- sions of the settlement, or as  a  person  having  the statutory powers of a tenant for life under the  Settled Land Acts  (g).   No  doubt that would be so,  unless some alterations in the law  were  made,  because, as matters stand, whenever  a purchaser has notice of a trust he is bound to see that the transaction with him is  authorised by that  trust.    Now there are two ways of dealing with this ques- tion. - The  first and simplest would be to follow the practice with regard to settled stocks and  shares, viz., vest the legal ownership   in  trustees, and keep  all notice of  trusts off the ownership  title.   In the case of stocks the  ownership is proved  by an entry in the Company&apos;s  register, and  no  notification  of trusts is allowed.  No  inconvenience  is  caused in  such  cases, because the  ownership of  stocks confers no such desir- able social rights as does  the  ownership of land.  But if settled land  were to be placed  on the same basis, and if purchasers and lessees were (as would be the essence of such  a scheme) to  be restricted to dealing with the trustees, two difficulties would have to be  faced, viz. : (1)  The trustees,  and  not the  beneficial  life  tenant, would have  to be the legal landlords; all leases would have to  be made in their names. All rent would have to be paid to them,  and all breaches of covenant by the tenants  would have to be sued for in  their  names. Actions  for  trespasses and other injuries  to the land would have  to be taken in  their  names. The beneficial tenant for life would,  in  fact, be reduced  to the  posi- tion of  an  annuitant.  (2) Such a system  would  be altogether contrary to the policy of the Settled Land Acts,  which (as stated  above) was  to  place beneficial tenants  for  life and other  persons in analogous situa- tions in the position  of trustees for their  successors, and to confer upon them large statutory powers  of sell- ing,  leasing, and, in proper  cases, mortgaging  the settled land while safeguarding the material interests of their successors  by  causing all capital  money aris- ing from sale or  mortgage to  be  paid either  to the trustees  or into  Court.    This  policy was  intended not merely for the  benefit of the persons  interested under the settlement, but also of the tenants of the land, so  as to give the beneficial owner for the time being  a free hand in  its develop- ment and management, and it  is,  therefore, hopeless to  dream  of reversing it  by  vesting all  rights  in trustees, with  whom alone third parties should  hence- forth deal.    That being so, how is  the difficulty  to be met?    My suggestion  as  to this is  a simplification  of an ingenious  scheme elaborated in Lord  Haldane&apos;s Con- veyaneing Bill of 1913.  Substantially this scheme pro- vides that the entire fee simple or term, of years which is the subject of the settlement is to be conveyed from time to time to each successive tenant for life or in tail as and when  he becomes  entitled to possession.   He would thus become the ostensible absolute legal owner, although in  reality  only a trustee  for himself and his successors.   In order to prevent a tenant for life from dealing with the estate  and pocketing the  proceeds so as  to   injure  his  successors,  the  scheme   would   (g) I have been seriously told that the British Bolshevist is so concerned  at the cost of investigating titles  thati there is danger of a revolution, or at least of a &quot; general  strike &quot; in consequence.  It has always appeared to me,  however, that  he was  exclusively i in&apos; interested in obtaining land  without any payment or compensation, and  that  the  costs of  employing a solicitor to investigate the victim&apos;s title neither has entered nor could  enter  into his calcu- lations.                                               E
 provide  that  the  instrument  conveying   the   pro- perty  to  him  should  contain  an  appointment of trustees  for   the   purposes   of   the   Settled  Land Acts, and  (if the settlement so allows) it  must  also contain provisions extending the powers of the Settled Land Acts.   The  appointment  of Settled  Land  Act trustees  would   act  as  a   danger   signal,   inti- mating to  purchasers, mortgagees and others that the ostensible legal owner is really a trustee whose powers arc  limited to those conferred  by  the  Settled  Land Acts as extended (if at all) by the conveyance in ques- tion. The settlement itself is to  be kept  off the  title, and  i,s in no way to affect or concern a purchaser, mort- gagee,  or  lessee.   The  document  in fact vesting the estate in a tenant for life in possession   creates in favour of a purchaser,  mortgagee, or lessee  what may be called a certified tenant for life  capable of excrcis- ing  the  powers of the  Settled Land Acts^ and  such extension&apos; (if any) of those powers as  the instrument: may contain, and also creating certified  trustees of the settlement  for the purposes of the Settled Land Acts, to whom all capital money arising from sales and mort- gages would have to be paid.   All that a purchaser, mortgagee,  or lessee wouldbe bound to do would be  to  satisfy himself that  the proposed transaction  with  him  fell within  (1)   thestatutory powers of a tenant for life as (2)  extended(if at: ali) by the conveyance to the certified life tenant.By this  means the title to real and leasehold  estateswould be greatly simplified and  shortened,  consistingwholly of simple conveyances and mortgages; for onthe death of each successive life tenant or tenant in tailhis  executors  or  administrators would simply  convey the estate to the next person beneficially  entitled to the possession  (if a person falling within the Settled LandActs), or, if not, then to the trustees of  the settlementor the person absolutely entitled.   The  Act would have to  contain transitional  pro-visions with regard to existing settlements, which might take some  such form as this :-       (T.) If the whole estate which is  the  subject of    any  existing  settlement (whether created by deed    or will) is already vested in the trustees  thereof,    then they shall forthwith vest it in the person who    has  the  powers  of  a  tenant  for  life under  the    Settled Land Acts.      (2.) But if the whole estate  which is the subject    of that settlement is  not vested in the  trustees    thereof, then the trustees thereof for the purposes    of the  Settled Land Acts (if any) and if there be    none then  such trustees when appointed shall    execute a vesting deed declaring that the whole    estate which  is the subject of the settlement shall    vest in themselves or  in  the  person (if  any)  who    is then entitled to exercise the powers of a tenant    for  life of settled land under the Settled Land Acts,    and  thereupon such estate shall vest accordingly  &apos; and  the  settlement  shall be  construed  and  take    effect as if all the  legal limitations therein  con-    tained  were equitable limitations by way of trust.   If the criticism be made that  this scheme is highly artificial, inasmuch as  it enables a person to pose as owner for  purposes of sale, leasing, etc., who is  not the  real owner,  the answer is  that Parliament  has already  accepted the  idea in relation to  registration of title, as the Registrar invariably registers  a  tenant for life as the statutory proprietor..   Moreover, all that it comes to is this, that in setfle-ments of land you must have two sets of trustees; one,the trustee of the land itself,  who  must always be theperson or persons to whom the Settled  Land Acts givepowers of sale and leasing, and tho other the trustees of capital moneys arising from sales, etc.          (VIII.) As TO REGISTERED LAND.   It may be further pointed out that the scheme aboveadvocated would greatly  simplify registration of title.As was pointed out by tho Report of the Select Com-mittee on Land Titles and Transfer of  1878, &quot; to legis-&quot;late for  the registration  of  titles without,  as a  pre-&quot;liminary step, simplifying the titles to be  registered&quot; is to begin at the wrong end.&quot;  In fact, as  the RoyalCommission  on Land Transfer said in  their Report of1912, &quot;one of the great  objections to  registration  of&quot;title is that the Registrar has to determine judicially&quot; who is the person to be registered from time to time&quot;as  proprietor.&quot;  If  my scheme were adopted, the Actshould include a clause  providing that the  Registrarshall register as proprietor the person in whom  thewhole estate, the subject  of  the settlement (i&apos;.e.,  thewhole  fee simple or the whole term of years settled)has  been vested  by a vesting  deed, and  shall not  beentitled or bound to  inquire into the equitable title ofthe various limited owners beneficially interested underthe settlement, nor as to whether the person or personsin whom the estate  is vested is or are the  person  or persons in whom it ought properly  to have been  sovested.   There are also divers  other small amendments  ofthe law which might be  added to  such  a Bill, such  asan amendment of the rule against perpetuities, makingthe signing of a simple receipt on a mortgage equiva-lent  to a reconveyance, and perhaps some others.                    CONCLUSION.   Lastly, it  may possibly be objected that the  pro-posed reforms would not render the transfer of landcheaper and  simpler at once;  and, no doubt, it wouldtake some time to work  off the existing complexities of titles.  But I am not able to suggest any method of enabling a landowner at the  present date  to sell  ormortgage his  land so as to give his purchaser or mort-gagee  an  absolute  title  unless  (1) the purchaser  ormortgagee investigates the  title, or (2)  it is  registeredat the Land Registry with an absolute title.  But what-ever view one may take as to the desirability  of extend-ing compulsory registration of title  to the  whole  ofEngland and  Wales (as to which I express no opinion),yet to obtain  such registration an  official investigation is necessary,   which &apos;has  to be paid  for.    Moreover,many titles are defective and could not be so registered,and  yet the defect is of such a nature that purchasersand  even  mortgagees are  willing to  take the risk.Lastly,  to get all the land of  England  registered withan absolute  title would be  a  gigantic task,  extending over a long series of years, and necessitating an enor-mous increase in the  skilled staff at the Registry, andwould,  indeed,  be equivalent to  a  new &quot;DoomsdayBook,&quot;  in which every owner would have to have histitle  investigated for  a considerable number  of years.   My scheme would, I  confidently  believe,  within amuch  shorter  period greatly  alleviate the  existingdifficulties.
APPENDIX  II.REPORT   BY   SUB-COMMITTEE                                       Consisting ofMR. ARTHUR UNDERBILL.SIR CLAUD SCHUSTER, K.C., C.V.O.SIR WALTER TROWER.MR. A.  E. RUSSELL.MR. ALFRED TOPIIAM.   We understand that the general principle of thescheme outlined by Mr.  Underhill in the draft clausesscheduled to  this Report  has  been  approved by theMain Committee, and that  the reference to us as a Sub-Committee is to consider the various Bills  which havebeen put forward  to facilitate  transfer of land andtechnical questions and details arising in connectionwith the  adoption of Mr. Underhill&apos;s proposals, and toreport to the Committee thereon.   We have considered various  Bills which have beenprepared by eminent Conveyancers, and have comparedthem with Mr. Underhill&apos;s  draft clauses, which for con-venience we refer to as Mr. Underhill&apos;s proposals.   There are five of these Bills of which we  have re-ceived prints, viz.       (i) The Copyhold  and  Special Tenures Bill,    prepared  by Mr. Cherry (one of the Conveyancing    Counsel of the Court), and  Sir  F.  F.  Liddell,    K.C.B.   (the  chief  Government  Parliamentary    Draftsman).       (2) The  Renewable Leaseholds   Conversion    Bill, prepared by Mr.  Cherry.       (3) The Intestacy Bill, prepared by the  late Mr.    Sweet  (one of the  Conveyancing Counsel of the    Court).       (4) The Trustee  Bill, prepared  by  Mr. Cherry    and Mr. A. E.  Russell (one of  the Conveyancing    Counsel of the Court).       (5) The Settled   Land Acts  Amendment  Bill,    prepared by the two last-mentioned gentlemen.We have also  considered-       (6) The Real Property and Conveyancing Bill,    prepared   by  the late  Sir  Philip  Gregory, Mr.    Cherry, and  Sir  F.  F. Liddell, K.C.B., which    combined  the  provisions  of the above Bills, ex-    cept the  Intestacy  Bill,  and  introduced a new    system of Conveyancing having the same end in    view as Mr.  UnderhilPs proposals, but introduc-    ing a new legal vocabulary, necessitating long and    complicated definitions and  a Register  of Cautions    and  Inhibitions.   We presented  a preliminary Report to the  Com-mittee, which  was considered at the seventh  meetingon the 25th March, 1919.   Mr. Cherry subsequently prepared the  draft of theLaw of Property Bill, on  which he  invited discussion,and this Bill has been carefully  considered  by  the Sub-Committee, who suggested considerable amendments,with a  result  that the  Bill has been rearranged and very much simplified,  and important  changes  made which have involved very careful and  laborious revise-sion, a task which was readily accepted by Mr. Cherry.   The Sub-Committee now report on the amended bill as follows :    We are  satisfied that Mr. Cherry&apos;s Bill carries outthe principle  of  Mr. UnderhilPs  proposals,  and werecommend that  it be adopted in its entirety.   Part I., Clause 1, gives effect to  the main  principleof Mr. UnderhilPs proposals as explained in a pamphletentitled &quot; The Line of Least Resistance,&quot; by Mr. Under-hill-namely,  -that the law relating  to  terms  of yearsshall henceforth also apply to freeholds; copyholds andall special tenures, such  as Gavelkind, being abolished.   Clauses 2 to 18 provide machinery for giving effectto the  principle of Clause  1, and carry out in detail,with some  necessary alterations and amendments, the objects indicated  in  Clauses 3 and  9 to 14 of Mr.UnderhilPs proposals.   These  clauses will permit theusual complicated provisions of settlements of land tocontinue as equitable interests, provided that such corn-plications are not to be  disclosed on  the occasion of asale, and are to be disregarded by a purchaser  or mort-gagee in  a manner similar to the course adopted  where    8707stocks and shares are comprised in  a  marriage  settle-ment.  This object is effected in Mr. Cherry&apos;s Bill With.out the introduction of new legal terms, the well-known&apos;distinction between  &quot; legal estates &quot; and &quot; equitable in-terests&quot;  being  preserved  as  recommended  by  theSpecial Committee of  the General Council of  the Barin 1913.   Owing to the difficulty caused by the existence ofequities of redemption in fee simple, this  result  has only been rendered possible by the introduction  of theprovisions relating to  mortgages which will be  foundin Clause 13 and the second Schedule of Mr. Cherry&apos;bill.  These provisions, as suggested  by Mr. Under-hilPs proposals,  Clause 16,  render  obligatory  in  thecase of freehold  land  a system  of mortgaging similarto that at present in use in the case  of terms of  years.We  consider that  these  mortgage provisions will sogreatly simplify the  form  of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Bill as to bean essential part of  the scheme.   Clause 14 of Mr. Cherry&apos;s Bill gives effect to  therecommendations of the  Committee as  to undividedshares in land by providing that the  land shall be heldon  trust  for sale with power to postpone sale,  the trustee,  if any, or if  none,  the beneficiaries,  if  notmore than four, as joint tenants, and in other cases thePublic Trustee being authorised to exercise these trusts.These provisions  we  consider would  effect  greatsimplification in  the transfer of land wherever difficul-ties are now caused by undivided shares held by persons as tenants in common.   Clauses 15, 16,  and 17, and the Third and FourthSchedules  in   Mr.   Cherry&apos;s  Bill,  provide  furthermachinery  for giving  effect to the  principles of  Mr.UnderhilPs proposals, and are essential to the  scheme.They include provisions permitting  equitable  entailedinterests  in ^personalty to be created in the same simplemanner as in the case of  land, as recommended by theCommittee.   Clause  19  of Mr.  Cherry&apos;s Bill  and  the  SixthSchedule dealing with land held by infants and lunaticswill  not  be  found  in  Mr. UnderhilPs proposals,  butwe consider that they carry out the general principle,and  would facilitate the transfer of land, and we recom-mend their adoption.   Clauses 20 and 21 and the Seventh  Schedule to  Mr.Cherry&apos;s  Bill are also not included in  Mr. UnderhilPsproposals, but facilitate land  transfer in  an importantmanner.   A purchaser is at present bound to requireproof of  payment  of  Estate  and other  death duties,since they  may become a charge on  the land.   Thisclause relieves the  purchaser of this liability, and hewill, if this  Clause  is adopted, only  be required to in-clude a search for this charge  in his searches  at theOffice of Land Registry.  This would effect a consider-able simplification in  transfer of land, and we recom-mend its  adoption.   Clause 22 contains similar  provisions  precludingthe  necessity of a  separate search in  the BankruptcyOffice, thus giving  effect to Clause  18 of Mr. Under-hilPs proposals.  This also  would effect a simplification-tiori in transfer of land.   Clauses 23 to 27 contain explanatory and supple-mental provisions and details with  a view to a sinr-plification of the form of a conveyance, including thechange advocated  by  Clause  2 of  Mr.  UnderhilPsproposals with regard to  the  abolition of the necessityof words of limitation.   Clause 28 facilitates  dealing with  land held  oncharitable trusts.  This is intended  to bring charitieswithin the scheme  of  the Bill,  which, stated  broadly,is to have four classes of vendors only (apart fromsales by the Court), viz. : absolute owners, mortgageeswith power of sale, trustees  for sale,  and tenants for life.                                           E  2
   Clause 29 and the Eighth  and Ninth Schedules toMr. Cherry&apos;s Bill contain specimen  forms not essentialto the Bill,  which  would,  however, be  useful as ex-plaining the new practice intended  to be introduced.   Clause 31 contains savings necessary for the pur-pose of preventing  misconception.   Part II. The object  of this part of the  Bill, whichincorporates the provisions  of the  Settled Land ActsAmendment Bill, is to make  certain  long requiredamendments of the Settled Land Acts, which  have re-ceived the approbation  both of the Bar Council andthe Law Society.   They are very  detailed,  but the upshot of all of them is to increase the administrativepowers of a  tenant for life, so as still further to remove the fetters imposed by settlements on dealings with land.   It is, in fact, the result of 36 years&apos; experienceof the working of  the Settled  Land Acts; and as  weare clearly of opinion that  its provisions  would sim-plify  and cheapen  sales  and leases, we consider thatit would facilitate the transfer of  land.   It includes theprovisions of the latter  part of Clause 10,  Sub-Clause(2) and Sub-Clause (4) of Mr. Underbill&apos;s proposals.   In our Preliminary Report we called the attentionof the Committee  to the fact, brought  to our noticeby Sir Walter Trower, that the Law  Society has in contemplation a much more drastic amendment of  theSettled Land Acts,  amounting to investing tenants for life with the same powers as  fee simple owners sub-ject to provisions protecting capital, and to their exer-cising the powers  as trustees.  We  understand  thatthe Committee  agreed  that the suggestion  made byMr.  Cherry should be incorporated in  the Bill to  theeffect  that in any  case not covered by  the - expresspowers of the Act,  the tenant for life should be autho-rised  to act with  the consent of  the  trustees or anOrder of  the Court.   This,  we consider, has  been satisfactorily effected, with  the necessary  safeguards,by Clause 48  of the  Bill.   Clause 71  of the  Bill gives effect  to a suggestion made by Mr. Topham to the effect that the mortgageesof the life interest should (without  the necessity of theconsent which is now required) be bound by the exer-cise of the tenant for life&apos;s powers,  substituting for theabove consent a consent to the  investments in whichcapital money arising from the exercise of those powersto be invested.  The mortgagees of a reversioner are atpresent subject to  the exercise of the tenant  for life&apos;spowers, and there seems to be no good reason  why thesame rule should  not apply to the mortgagees of  the life estate, particularly as it would  greatly  shorten andsimplify abstracts of  title.   Mr.  Underhill  had one onhand running to 50 odd typed brief sheets,  which, ifthis proposed amendment had been in force, wouldscarcely have exceeded five.   Part III. Contains amendments of the  Conveyanc-ing Acts 1881 to 1911, all of which except Clauses 82,83, 84, and 85 (containing useful amendments as to themaintenance of infants) would tend to facilitate trans-fer of land.   We call  attention  particularly to Clause 86, underwhich  power  is   given  to  the Official  Arbitratorsappointed under the  Acquisition  of Land  (assessment of CompensaPon)  Act, 1919, to discharge or modifyrestrictive covenants.  This  we  consider should  takethe place of Clause 6 of Mr. UnderhilPs proposals asbeing more elastic and equitable; also to Clause 88which extends the provisions of Section 45 of  the Con-veyancing Act,  1881, to the  redemption of perpetualrents reserved on sales, as recommended by the Com-mittee: and to  Clause 89,  by which 30 years is sub-stituted for  40 years for the  root of title, thereby giving effect to a recommendation of the Royal Commissionof 1912 (No. 2), subject to the modifications agreed bythe main Committee, and which,  in conjunction withClause 90  of Mr.  Cherry&apos;s Bill should tend to saveexpense on the transfer of land,  and bring  the  lawunder an open contract more into  harmony  with thepractice under formal contracts and Conditions of Sale.   Part IV. This pant  of the Bill, which  incorporatesthe provisions of the Trustee Bill, directly facilitatesthe transfer of land only so far as it proposes that on theappointment of a  new Trustee, the trust property isto  vest automatically without any conveyance, vest-ing declaration, or vesting order, and gives purchasersand mortgagees from trustees additional protection, byfreeing them from the necessity of  enquiry whether themoney is wanted and as to  its application, and enables trustees of  the proceeds of  sale  of an undivided shareof land to join with the persons interested in the otherundivided shares  notwithstanding that the trustees orany of them are beneficially interested in such othershares.   It  also gives to trustees for sale, who are by the trustinstrument empowered to expend  capital money for any purpose,  power to raise it by mortgage of land pending a sale.   We consider  that this  part of the Bill  is useful,and would facilitate the operation of the main schemeof the Bill.   It  does not give effect  to a  suggestion which was discussed  by  the Committee, but not  webelieve definitely decided, that power should be given toa majority of a body  of Trustees  to deal with the trustproperty  without  the concurrence  of the minority. Sucha power  would facilitate the transfer of land in casesof deadlock, which, however, in our experience are ex-extremely rare and can usually be satisfactorily dealt withby the Court.  Parts V. and VI.  of Mr.  Cherry&apos;s Bill (which incor-porates the provisions of  the  Copyhold  and SpecialTenures  Bill,  except  as to Special Tenures which  are dealt  with in Part I.) proposes that all Copyhold landshall  immediately and automatically be converted intoland  of  ordinary freehold tenure, thus giving  effectto the unanimous recommendation of the  Committee.But this  automatic enfranchisement is  not to effect anymanorial incidents  of pecuniary  value, except such as are inconsistent  with freehold tenure (such  as  for-feitures for alienation by deed or  without license).  Therights of the Lord of pecuniary value (such  as  theright  to  fines, heriots, etc.) are left to be extinguishedsubsequently on  payment of proper compensation.  Aperiod of five  years is allowed, during which the lord and tenant may  agree as  to this, or  either may give notice for compulsory enfranchisement on payment ofcompensation on a scale prescribed by the Act, whichdiffers from.that  prescribed by  the Copyhold Act, 1894,in details, at  the request of the Board of Agricultureand  Fisheries. If, by the end of the five years, the Lordhas not  enforced his rights, he loses them altogether.   The Bill also provides compensation for  Stewardsof Manors.   The rights of the Lord to mines and minerals  andto the use of the land for sporting  purposes are  un-affected by this part of the Bill, but facilities for work-ing the mines are provided by Clause 94 in cases where this  would result in  neither party being able  to work  the mines.   This  part  of  the Bill carries out  the  principle of clause 4 of Mr. UnderhilPs  proposals.    The muchgreater  length and complication of  the provisions ofMr.  Cherry&apos;s Bill  are mainly  due to  the necessity in-sisted on by the  Board of Agriculture  of spreading outthe work of awarding compensation over a considerable period and encouraging  compensation by  agreement.The draft has been,  we understand,  approved both bythe Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and by the Law Society.    We consider,  therefore, that  it  should betaken en  bloc as part of the  general scheme of  Mr.UnderhilPs proposals.   Part  VII.,  Clause  132  and the Fifteenth Schedule.-The object of this part of the Bill which gives effectto the provisions of the  Renewable   Leaseholds Con-version Bill is to abolish an undesirable form of tenure which prevails in some places, including  London  andCornwall. Under this tenure a fee simple owner leasesland  either for a fixed term of years  or for three lives, coupled  with a right for  the lessee to enforce the  per- petual renewal of  it either at  an increased  rent or on payment of  a fine.   The Bill proposes that all suchleaseholds shall be immediately and automatically con- verted into a  long term of 2,000  years. The fines,  fees and similar payments which would become due on the renewal  of the  lease at present, will continue to be payable  at the same times by way of additional  rent unless they  are  commuted.  We think that  this Bill tends to  simplification.  No substantial reason for the continuance of this  form of tenure  appears  to exist, and we  recommend that effect be given to this part of the Bill.                 ,    Clause 133 as to interesse  termini abolishes an in- convenient and  wholly unnecessary rule of  law which is merely a source  of difficulty  and expense.    Part  VIII.  relates  to Intestacy__Clauses 134 and 135 extend the powers of the personal  representatives of sale  and management, and reproduce  the provisions which are perhaps  most frequently  inserted in  wills
drawn by skilled draftsmen.  These provisions give a mandate to the personal representative to sell, and will,in our view, facilitate the transfer of land.   Clauses 136 to 13b provide that on intestacy the beneficial interest in ireenolds shall devolve in the same way as personal estate.   It is an essential part  of thescheme for facilitating the transfer of  land that bothclasses of property should devolve in the same manner,and this was the primary  object  of Clause 7  of  Mr.Underhill&apos;s proposals.  The method of devolution  pro-vided  in the Bill allows  what we  consider  to  be themost  usual  provisions in carefully drawn  wills; butthe actual method of devolution suggested in  the  Billis not essential to the scheme.   Part IX. Contains amendments of  Part I.  of theLand  Transfer Act, 1897, dealing with the  vesting ofland in the personal representatives at the death.  Thisis now essential to the main scheme of the Bill, havingregard to the fact that on the death of a tenant for life,the settled land will vest in his personal representatives.   Part X. By Part X.  it is intended to give  effect tothe Recommendations  of the  Royal Commission asamended by the Main Committee in the practical de-tails of Registration of Title as at present in use in theCounty of London.   Part XI. contains definitions which  are essential tothe Bill as  a whole.   Rule against Perpetuities. We should have liked to suggest an amendment of the Rule against Perpetui-ties in this part of the Bill  in the direction of applyingthat Rule according to the actual  event instead of as now,  according  to possible events at the date  of thesettlement.   it  appeared to us, however, that this would have gone  beyond  the terms of  the reference to the Com-mittce,  as it  is only remotely  connected with thecheapening and simplification of Land Transfer.  the rule,   however,  demands serious  modification, as  itfrequently produces inj ustice and disappoints the inten-tions  of Testators and  settlers.   A  not  infrequentexample occurs in the case of marriage settlements,where a clause postponing  the vesting in the childrenuntil the age of 25 makes the trust void ab initio, inas-much  as if  valid, it might tie up the property for morethan 21 years  after the  death of the  survivor of the husband and wife. Thus it has happened in such cases that the wife has died on  the birth of her first childintestate, with  the result that personal estate  settled by her has reverted to her estate, and through her to her husband absolutely, notwithstanding that the husbandhas lived for many years after the child has attained 25.   Finally, we desire to report to the Committee that theBill prepared by Mr. Cherry and  the other  gentlemennamed at the commencement of this Report which hasbeen prepared  with the very greatest  skill, care, andforesight, and the most cheerful readiness to give effectto the suggestions  and  criticisms of  the  Sub-Com-mittee,  carries  out  to the full the  principle  of Mr.UnderhilPs proposals, and we consider that  if it be-comes law it will very  greatly facilitate the transferof land quite apart  from any extension  of the systemof registration of title.   The whole Bill, however,  is so framed that the new system would fit in admirablywith registration  of title wherever it may be applied,and greatly facilitate the  task of the Registrar and hisassistants  by simplifying the nature of the  entries onthe Register, and reducing the work of investigatingand the risk in accepting titles for registration.   Much of the length  and apparent  complication ofMr. Cherry&apos;s Bill is due to the necessity of adjustingthe old intricate  system of Real  Property Law andConveyancing  to a new and  simple method of  landtransfer.

15                                         APPENDIX  IV.       MEMORANDUM   BY  MR.   B.   L.   CHERRY  ON   THEPRINCIPLES  AND  OBJECTS  OF  THE  LAW OF  PROPERTY                                                BILL,         PART I. (ASSIMILATION).i. The general principles adopted are as follow :     (i) That interests in land should be divided into&apos; two classes :         (a) &quot;Legal Estates,&quot;  consisting  of either     the fee simple or a term of years absolute.        (b) &quot; Equitable interests,&quot;   to  include ^ all     other interests in land, though it is recognised     that a fee  simple or a term of years absolute     may also take effect in equity under a settle-     ment.    (ii) That a purchaser (including a lessee or mort- gagee) of a  fee simple or a term  of years should, with insignificant exceptions,only be concerned  with legal estates,  being thus enabled to ignore equitable interests and powers; an equitable power (i.e., a power not vested in  the owner of  a legal estate in right of that estate)  being put on the same footing as an equitable interest.    The exceptions  include  a restrictive covenant of which a purchaser has notice, and an equitable interest  which  has  priority  to a legal mortgage and  of  which  the purchaser has  notice when he takes a title from a mortgagee selling under his power of sale.   This last case seldom occurs in practice.    (iii) That as legal estates are  to be made the basis of conveyancing         (a) All  bare outstanding legal estates must     be got in by the Bill.        (b) Legal mortgages (both  past and future)     must be  made to take effect by demise or sub-     demise  so as to leave  the fee simple or the     leasehold reversion  in  the mortgagor.   The     right to tack or make further advances, when     there has been  no  notice of the  mortgage     which may be affected,  must be expressly pre-     served as  the mortgages  will take effect at     law.        (c) A vendor should  not be able to throw     the cost of getting in a legal estate  on  to a     purchaser.      .  .  (iv)  That  to   enable  equitable   interests  and powers (whether created  before or after the  Bill) to be overriden, without damage to  the  persons interested, the existing well-known machinery of a trust for sale (under which a purchaser is not concerned with the  trusts  affecting the proceeds of sale or the rents  until sale)  and of a settlement  (under which a purchaser  is not  concerned  with  the family charges*) should be called  in  aid and extended thus :-        (a) If there  is a subsisting trust  for sale     then  that the   equitable interests should be     made to take effect as if  the same had  been     created  by  a declaration of  trust of the pro-     ceeds of sale.        (b) If there  is no trust for sale then that     the equitable interests should  be made to take     effect as if limited by a settlement.    (v) That,  to protect the equitable interests and powers thus made to take effect behind the curtain of a trust for  sale or a settlement, it is better to provide  that  the  capital money  arising  from a transaction  shall be paid either to a corporation    * Already family charges which are originally paramount  to a^ settlement  can be made to take  effect as if limited by the settle-  ment. in question, by obtaining the appointment of Settled Land Act  Trustees.   By  the Settled  Land Act part  of the Bill  absolute  owners are given the statutory powers of a tenant for life to enable  them to  override family charges.      8707 (as a trustee) or to  at least two* trustees  (being individuals)  rather  than  set  up  an  expensive register of cautions  and inhibitions.(vi) That  in  view of  the  enormous costsf  and complications  incidental   to  maintaining   legal estates in undivided shares in land  such  estates should be  abolished  and  rendered  incapable of being created in  the  future except behind the curtain :         (a) As  respects existing undivided shares,     by vesting the entirety of the land in trustees     on trust for sale, leaving the beneficial in-     terests (including charges on undivided shares)     to take  effect as trusts affecting  the proceeds     of sale and the rents until sale, so that  a pur-     chaser will not be concerned therewith.        (b) As respects the future by prohibiting     the creation  of  undivided shares,  except in     equity, under a setlement, and, when the trust     takes effect, by providing that the settled land     shall be held  on  trust for sale.    (vii) That a  purchaser should be freed from the onerous obligation of investigating the limita- tions and trusts  of settlements and of proving matters of pedigree  thereby involved.    (viii) That the tenant  for life of full  age or other person (called &quot; the statutory owner &quot;) who during a minority or when there is no tenant for life of full age has the statutory powers of a tenant for life is the proper person % to make  the custodian trustee of the settled land  (he cannot make away with  it) as  opposed  to the trustees  of the  settle- ment who will be responsible for the capital  money and securities.    (ix) That,  as  regards  settlements existing  at the commencement of the Bill, the trustees thereof should by a vesting deed transfer the settled  land (i.e. the  fee simple or term of years absolute)  to the  tenant  for  life  or statutory  owner on the trusts affecting  it and nominate themselves trus- tees thereof for the  purposes of the  Settled Land Acts, thus withdrawing  the trusts  from the title. A purchaser who acts on the faith of the vesting instrument  will be protected.    (x) That, as regards future settlements, these should. be made by two instruments,  and in no other way,, namely  by  an  instrument  (either  a deed, an  assent  by  an executor or administrator or an order of the Court)  vesting the settled land in the tenant for life or  statutory owner  on the trusts of  the  settlement (e.g.  a  separate deed  or a Will) and nominating  the trustees  of the settle. ment to  be  the trustees of the vesting instrument for the purposes of the Settled Land Acts.   In this way the  trusts are kept  off the title.  * The Court has always  endeavoured  to secure that there shallbe at least two trustees.  This practice has in the past encounteredsome  opposition, but now that the cost of appointing a new trusteeout of Court is so small (the statutory powers to make the appoint-ment  are nearly always available) there  is no longer any room forobjection.  Apart from the  protection against fraud,  it is obviousthat if investments stand in more than one namethe risk of trustproperty being  intermixed with  the trusteed private property iseliminated. The Bill does not prevent a trust being wound up by asole trustee.         ^  t It is  not uncommon for the costs in a partition  action toexhaust  the whole or  nearly  the whole value of the land. the partition Acts will be  repealed.  tHc  may be an absolute owner subiect to family charges (seeSettled Land Part of  the Bill).  He has powers  which put  himalmost on the same footing as an absolute owner, and is entitled tothe possession of the title deeds.  His position of responsibility isnot one which trustees would readily undertake.  If the trusteeswere constituted the custodian trustees and made liable to do whatthe tenant  for life directed, their position would be intolerable; itwould be  ah attempt  to divorce power from responsibility, andwould result  in nearly  doubling the costs of all transactions re-lating to settled land.   The possibility of a recalcitrant trustee mustnot be ignored.                                            F 2
    (xi) That on the death of the tenant for life or statutory owner,  his personal  representative (in whom  the fee simple or term of years will  vest), should in writing assent to the land vesting in the person next  entitled, and if a settlement remains on  foot,  should,  by  the  assent,  nominate  the Settled Land Act Trustees.    (xii) That legal  estates should (except  in the&quot;case of titles  acquired by long possession or under bankruptcies) only be capable  of being  transferred inter vivos  by an instrument in writing (e.g.  a conveyance,  vesting  order, assent or vesting &quot;de- claration) and that transmissions on  death  should. be evidenced by the probate or letters of adminis-i tration.   A  Will should  only  create equitable interests.      . .    (xiii) That  the  Statute  of  Uses  should  be re- pealed, other provision being  made for reserving a legal estate (e.g. a legal rent charge or an ease- ment  in fee simple) when the  land is conveyed, without  having to resort to  a  regrant from  the grantee  of  the land,  and for  confirming  legal estates which by reason of some mistake have not been  validly granted.   . (xM That all life interests  (*) estates tail,  base fees, executory limitations (past and future) should be allowed only to take effect in  equity behind  a trust for sale or a settlement.    (xv) That  interests  in  tail (f) should (as has hitherto been possible in  the case of  freeholds) be capable of being created (but in  equity only) in all property (behind a trust  for sale or a  settlement) so as not to affect a purchaser of a legal estate.    (xvi) That infants should not  take legal estates. As  an  infant cannot execute  a conveyance (a fedffment in  gavelkind will no longer be possible)&apos; this  proposition  follows  from the principle  that estates (as opposed to powers) are to be the basis of conveyancing&apos;.    It will be so much easier for the  layman to understand  that  if a legal estate is shewn to be vested in A,  then  that  A  or  his personal  repre- sentative should be the right person to convey and not X.    Or if X does convey then he should (as attorney) convey in the name of A.    Obviously  however if A were an infant it would be useless for X to convey in the name of A, hence the Bill provides that the legal estates of infants shall vest or  be  vested in  the persons who  have power to make title during the minority.    (xvii) That the legal estates of  lunatics  and defectives should  be conveyed in their names by their- committee  or receiver.   This  is  a  further example of the  same  principle.  The  enactment to this effect makes the practice uniform.    (xviii) That a purchaser (for money or moneys worth) of a legal estate should be reasonably pro- tected against a charge for death duties.  It is not a fact that a purchaser of land  in possession  (not a reversionary interest in land) is frequently called on to  pay duty which accrued before the  date of his purchase,  such a claim has seldom if ever  been made, but the fact that  such a claim  is possible puts an intending purchaser to endless trouble. To carry out the proposal it is necessary to authorise the charge to be registered as  a &quot; land charge.&quot;   - The same scheme, as regards death  duties, has been incorporated  in the  Bill as was  adopted  in Lord Haldane&apos;s Bill of  1915.    (xix) That a purchaser (for  money  or moneys worth) should, without  endangering the interests of creditors,  be protected,  as far as possible,  from loss in consequence of the bankruptcy of the vendor, lessor or mortgagor.    For  the  security  of  the  creditors the  Bill authorises a petition&quot; in bankruptcy to be registered  * It has been suggested that it might have been possible to have allowed a  life estate to  have taken effect at law, but, apart fromthe confusion which would thereby have  resulted,, the completeanswer is that the interest of a tenant for life is  often liable to bedetermined in his lifetime.  This puts the case on the same  footing as  a  shifting use  or executory limitation.  t The limitation of an estate tail is a concise method of  makingproperty devolve in a particular way.  Any  attempt  to  abolishestates tail would be useless,  unless  at the  same  time trusts ofevery description were made void,  for conveyancers could  readilyeffect the same object by a  more cumbrous method.  No one at the present day desires to abolish trusts: it would bean insult to  public morality.as a Its penclens, and  a receiving order (whetherknown to affect land or not) to be registered as anorder  affecting  land.   The Bill  protects the purchaser if  the petitionwas filed before the date  of  his conveyance and neither the petition or receiving order is registered.   If the available act  of bankruptcy occurred be-fore the conveyance but the petition  was not filed,the purchaser cannot well  be  protected, if he hadnotice  of the act of bankruptcy, but  this risk  isalmost negligible.   (xx) That real estate and chattels  real should,so far  as possible,  be  made subject to the samelaw and practice.  This is the  underlying principleof the  main scheme and is enacted  in general terms  in the first clause, leaving the details to be worked out  by  the  different parts of  the Bill.   It is obvious that the adoption of this principleinvolves :-        (a) The  enfranchisement of  copyholds, see    Part  V.        (b) The  abolition  of special tenures, see    Part V.        (c) An   alteration  of  the  devolution  of    beneficial interests  on  intestacies,  see  Part    VIII.   Further the  fact  that  legal  estates are to be confined to  estates in  fee  simple  and terms ofyears absolute and that a purchaser is to be freed from matters depending on  the dropping of a lifeinvolves:         (a) The  conversion  of perpetually  renew-    able leaseholds into long terms, see Part VII;    for though  the  number of such leases  is not    large, the property affected by  this  indefen-    sible tenure is of considerable value, hence if    these interests were left to take effect only in    equity, the  scope of the Bill would be unduly    restricted, while the lessees might well claim    that they had been subjected to unjust treat-    ment.        (b) The  conversion of inieresse  termini into    legal terms, see Part VII.   On  the other hand  it must  be  admitted  that land being corporeal must  differ from  incorporealhereditaments,  such as  a manor or  a  rentcharge,while both differ from  pure personal estate, suchas stocks and shares.   Still, subject to the qualifi-cations inherent to the  subject matter,  the Billseeks to harmonise the law of  real and personalestate.   The acceptance of the principle that real estateshould be placed as  far as practicable on the same footing as leaseholds involves the abolition of thosetechnicalities which affect  real estate  but do not affect  chattels   real, but  the  principle actuallyadopted in the  Bill  would be better  stated  thus-   (xxi) That all  technicalities which  serve  no useful   purpose   should  be abolished.  This ofcourse  would include the abolition, of:         (a) The  need for special words of  limita-    tion  (e.g.  &quot;heirs&quot;  &quot;in  fee  simple&quot;  or    &quot; successors &quot;)  to  pass the fee simple in a    deed.  Customary  assurances  can  now be    ignored  as  ajl  copyholds are  to  be enfranchisement-    chised.        (b) The  need for  the  word  &quot; use &quot; in a    voluntary conveyance to negative  an implied    resulting use.   The  repeal  of  the  Statute  of Uses  and theabolition  of  legal executory limitations will pre-vent the automatic shifting of legal estates fromone  person   to  another, as well as  prevent thesplitting up  of  legal estates into life  estates andremainders.        (c) The  double  possibility  rule.  &apos;        (d) The  rule  as to  contingent  remainders.        (e) The  absence of  power  effectually to    charge  a rentcharge on  another  rentcharge,    see Part III.  For instance where the  settled    land consists of perpetual rentcharges  and it    is  desired  to create a jointure or pin  money    rentcharge  in  equity   no   mere  technicality    should be allowed  to stand in the  way  of this    being done. This carries out the idea that the.    distinctions between corporeal and incorporeal    hereditaments should  be  reduced  to a mini-     mum.
155   equitable chargee  to register a  memorial of the   instrument creating his charge.    A mortgagee^   power of sale is really wide enough under the exist-   ing law, when he  sells he can override all subse-   quent incumbrances, as well as the mortgagors   equity of redemption and all trusts affecting it.          (e) By the  Court, by means of a vesting       order, and in particular for the purpose of sell-       ing land affected by an equitable charge (see       Second  Schedule to Bill).  Until the  chargee       registers  a  Us  pendens the  existence of  the       charge does not affect the power of the estate       owner to deal with his legal estate.      A vesting order operates to pass the legal estate   as if it had been conveyed by the estate owner. The   Bill does not prejudicially affect the jurisdiction   of the Court to  bind equitable interests.      (xxiv) That a trust for sale should not be ren-   dered nugatory  by  reason  of the consent of  more   than  two persons  being made requisite  before it   can be  exercised.      This point is covered by the  provisions in the   Fourth  Schedule to the Bill.      (xxv) That dealings with land held on trust for   sale or  subject to a settlement should not be ham-   hampered or  rendered  impossible  by   reason of  the   appointment of  more than  four trustees.      This is covered  by the provisions in Part  IV of   the Bill.           &apos;                   ,    .       (xxvi) That  in  view of the additional equitable   interests which  are made to attach  to the proceeds   of sale  of land  held on trust for sale or  are made   to take effect as if limited by a  settlement trustees   should  on winding up a  trust  be  able to protect   themselves  by issuing advertisements in the same   way  as an  executor  can  protect  himself against   unknown claims.       This is provided for in Part  IV. of  the Bill.   2. The general results which will be obtained whenthe Bill  ,becomes law  can be shortly stated as: fel-lows :-       (i) The  Bill (as explained  above)  places  all    interests in land, except legal estates in fee simple    or for  a term of years  absolute, behind a curtain    consisting of either a trust for  sale  or  a  settle-    ment,  and frees a purchaser in  good  faith from    any  obligation  to  look behind  the curtain.   By    this method, with  the aid of the provisions relating    to mortgages and the  getting  in  of  outstanding    legal  estates, the reforms sought  in  Lord Hal-    dane&apos;s Bill  of  1915  are, with insignificant  excep-    tions,  carried  out,  without  the  complications    incidental to that  scheme, without inventing any    new nomenclature;, and  without setting  up a    register of  cautions and  inhibitions.       (ii)  By  creating this curtain  the same results    (affecting past  as  well as  future transactions)  are    obtained without  a  register as  are claimed under    any  scheme of registration of  title based on  the    Torrens&apos; system with the  following exceptions :            (a)  Investigation and reinvestigation of the        title to the legal estate cannot be got rid of        save by a register in which the effect of trans-        actions are noted up  to date, with the  result        that the process of simplification is not com-        plete in this  respect.       In  the meantime  investigation and  reinvesti-     gation  can  be reduced a minimum  first  by re-     ducing the length of title, secondly  by reducing     the class of documents which have to be abstracted     and produced to a purchaser and thirdly by  simpli-     fying  and  shortening the  documents  themselves.        It must be  remembered that some  investigation     or enquiries must be made whether or not a title     is registered, eg. enquiries must be made as to     land tax, tithe  rentcharge, outgoings and tenancies.     It must be seen  that  there are  no squatters for   -  the  register can  only  properly take  the place of     the  documentary  title.        Moreover the  register  itself must be  inspected.     These matters in the main relate to what ought     to be  done before a contract  is  signed. &apos;            (b)  No  state  guarantee  of  title  against         fraud  or  mistake  can be  given  unless the         land is registered.            (c)  In  conveyances, mortgages  and leases         (but  not in transfers of mortgages or  assign-         ments of  leases) the  land must on each occa-         sion be described in terms sufficient to identify         it.  On  the  other hand  where there is  an       (f) The doctrine  of  interesse  termini,  see    Part VII.   Other  examples will  be  found throughout  theBill.  The amendments  of matters  of  detail  to-gether with the additional powers given to trustees(designed  to  shorten  legal  documents) can, as a rule, only be made operative  in regard  to instru-ments  executed after  the  commencement of  theBill; hence, (unlike the provisions abolishing renew-able leaseholds, enfranchising copyholds or affectinglegal  estates,  equitable interests,  mortgages,  un-divided  shares,  trusts  for  sale and settlementswhich have, an immediate effect in regard to pastdealings)  some  time  must  elapse before the  fullbeneficial  effect of such  reforms can be felt.   It is obvious  however  that  the  powers  of management (see  Part I.) given to personal repre-sentatives and other trustees for sale, should applywhether the trust  was created before or after  theBill.   (xxii) That,  in view  of  the  new  rule thatestates  and not powers  should be  the basis  ofconveyancing,  special  powers must  be given  tocorporations to  act under  powers of attorney,  bymeans of their officers.   These powers being  soessential  to  the  main  scheme are  inserted  inPart  I.  in place  of  Part  III.  which  containsamendments  of matter  of detail.   (xxiii)  That when the powers conferred by  the hill to override  equitable interests and powers  areexercised  title to the legal estate must be made :-        (a) Either  by trustees for sale  (including    personal  representatives  when  the  land is    vested in  them on  trust for sale) who will    receive the capital money; or        (b) Under  the Settled  Land Acts, when the    capital money will be paid to the trustees for     the purposes  of those Acts or into Court.   Charitable and public trusts are,  for the pur-poses of the Bill, made to take effect as if the landwere held on  trust for  sale  (subject to requisiteorders being obtained) in  order that the  CharityTrustees may be able to override equitable interests.   Title to a legal estate may also be made :-        (a) By  an absolute  owner whose estate is     not affected by equitable interests  or incumbered-    brances.        (b) By an  absolute owner with the con-     currence  of persons entitled  to equitable  in-     terests.   This mode of making  title is discouraged&apos; bythe Bill, as it temporarily and unnecessarily bringstrusts on  to the title, for the absolute owner, havingthe  statutory^ powers of a tenant   for life,  canalways override the equitable interests,  providedthat the capital money is paid to Settled Land ActTrustees.    Accordingly the Bill enacts (clauses 3 and 6) that if  title can be made without incurring the costof an  application to the  Court (this will seldombe required  in view of  the Settled  Land  Part of the Bill)  for the appointment of trustees,  the  pur- chaser is to be entitled to have title made under the statutory powers.   In no  case  (see clause 27) will a purchaser be bound  to accept a title made with the concurrence of persons entitled to equitable interests  if there are Settled Land Act Trustees, or to accept a title made with the concurrence of more  than two  such persons.        (c) By  an absolute owner  with  the  con-     currence of a legal mortgagee  (by demise or     subdemise).&quot;        (d) By  a  legal mortgagee under his power     of sale.  In the case of freeholds  his conveyance     will  pass  the fee simple  and  in the case of     leaseholds will usually pass  the leasehold re-     version  or head term, see Second Schedule to     Bill.    This  is the one case in which the present Bill does not go so far as Lord Haldane&apos;s Bill of  1915. The reason is, that, without the aid of a register of cautions and  inhibitions, it would not be  safe to enable a  mortgagee to override an equitable in- terest, which is paramount to his mortgage.  The purchase money cannot well be made payable to, any person other than the mortgagee.   For the same reason the provision relating  to  registration in Middlesex and Yorkshire, leaves it open for an
        official description the land can  (except when .  v i    part only is dealt with)  be conveyed by refer-        ring to  the official description.       (iii) The  vesting of the entirety of land held in   c undivided shares in trustees for sale will get rid of    what may be regarded as the greatest blot in the    existing  system.    Incidentally   this  will  place    further  land within  the  scope of  the  compulsory    provisions of the Land Transfer Acts and simplify    the. register.       (iv) The provisions respecting settlements above    referred to secure that no more difficulty will arise    in dealing with settled land  than if  it had  not &apos;   been  settled,  besides obviating   the difficulties    which the Royal Commission entertained as  to the &apos;  -proper method  of registering  settled land.       (v) The enfranchisement  of copyholds will get   ; rid of the last trace of feudalism and is absolutely    essential to any comprehensive measure of reform.    This, reform enables further land to be registered    under the Land Transfer Acts.       (vi) The  proposed amendments  of  the  law in    regard to details all make for simplicity and their    effect, by removing causes for error,  will be found    to be progressive.       The  parts, of the Bill which simplify the  law    in regard to beneficial interests  are outside  the    scope of the main  scheme, but such  simplification    will  assist the  owners of legal estates in  giving&quot;-effect to the trusts  and will  reduce costs.       Powers of management given  to trustees or to &apos;-&apos;  a tenant for life and provisions tending to simplify   - and  shorten documents  directly  affect the main    scheme.   -   &apos;      PART  II.  (SETTLED  LAND).*   The objects of this Part of the  Bill are :-       (a) To increase  the administrative powers of ;a tenant for life so as to remove still  further the    fetters imposed by settlements on  dealings  with    land  and  the  development  and  improvement of    settled estates; and in particular to give the tenant    for  life  power  to  carry out any reasonable trans-&apos;&quot;&apos; action, which  may not come within the express    powers, subject to the consent of the trustees of    the leave of  the Court being obtained.       (b) To reduce to a very large  extent the rium-    befs of cases in which application is necessary for    the  appointment  by the Court  of trustees of a  :  compound settlement.       (c) To put an absolute owner of land subject to &apos;  family charges  in the position of  a tenant for life    so as  to enable him on a  dealing under the Settled    Land Acts to overreach the family charges.       (d) To vest in the trustees of the settlement the    powers conferred  by the  Settled Land Acts in all&quot;&apos;,&quot;&apos; cases in which there is no tenant  for life.; &apos;;    (e) To facilitate  dealings  with  settled   land  &apos;  where the estate  of the tenant for life is incumbered-    bered, or he  has parted with his interest and there- &apos;: by lost all interest in the proper exercise of the    powers vested in him, and,       (f) To make certain amendments  in the Settled-  Land Acts which are long overdue.         PART  III.  (CONVEYANCING).   This part contains a number of amendments of theexisting  law  designed to simplify  the title to  and transfer of land.  The most material of these are :-h-W .&quot; &apos; (a) The: substitution of thirty years  for forty   &apos; years as the root of title on a sale  of land, sub-    ject to any stipulations to the  contrary in the con-&quot;  &apos; tract. &quot;   &apos;       (b) The abolition of acknowledgments by mar-    ricd women.       (c) Clauses  enabling  the  transfer of a  mort-    gage to be effected by a  deed which simply &quot;pur-\9  Sports&apos;to transfer the mortgage  or the  benefit    &quot;thereof,&quot; and the mortgaged property to be com- :  &quot; pletely discharged from the mortgage by a simple  --receipt under seal  without any reassignment,  sur-    render, or release.       (d) The substitution of registration at the Land-Registry for enrolment in the Central  Office in    the case of disentailing assurances and other docu-  - merits which now require to be enrolled under the-&quot;Fines and Recoveries Act,  1833.        ___. -*-Mr&apos; A  E. Russell has kindly&apos; prepared the notes  relating toTarts- IT.; Ill-,  and IV.       (e) Provisions enabling  the  official  arbitrators    appointed under the Acquisition of  Land (Assess-    ment of Compensation) Act, 1919, to discharge or    modify restrictive covenants.       (f) Provisions enabling  the  redemption  and    apportionment by the  Board of Agriculture and    Fisheries  of  perpetual rentcharges  or  what  are    known in the North of England as &quot;chief  rents&quot;    and       (g) Provisions enabling  either the lord  or  the    tenant  of land formerly copyhold which has been    enfranchised to acquire through  the Board of Agri-    culture and Fisheries the rights of the  other in    the mines and minerals under the land with any    necessary surface powers.   This Part  also contains many  important amend-ments of the existing law which less directly affect themain scheme of the Bill.            PART  IV. (TRUSTEES).   The object of  this Part is to make certain amend-ments  in the Trustee Act, 1893, relating to the powerto appoint  new  trustees, vesting  declarations  and orders,  and  also  to  shorten trust documents by con-ferring on trustees various powers which, it is claimed,may be safely given  to trustees, subject to  certain re-restrictions, and many  of which are in  common form andare to be found in most settlements  and  wills preparedby lawyers.   As  previously  mentioned in  this memorandum  thenumber of trustees is for the future restricted to four(except in the  case of trustees  of charities).   Clause 106  as previously  mentioned  enables trus-tees on winding  up  a  trust  to  protect  themselves against claims of which they have  no  knowledge  byadvertisement,  in the same manner as personal rcpre-sentatives can under the Law of Property amendment act, 1859.   As previously pointed out,  this power istendered necessary by reason of the additional  equitable-able interests which by the Bill  are made to take effectbehind a trust for sale or a  settlement.   By  Clause 109 a power of advancement is conferredin all  cases  where property is  held on  trust for sale.This is essential,  since by Part I a large  amount ofproperty will,  by  virtue  of the Act, be made subject toa trust for sale.   Clause in confers on the Court a useful power inany case where it is expedient, to  authorise dealings with trust property which could not otherwise be car-ried out.   Clause 114  contains provisions  for remedying the unsatisfactory estate of the law as  to money received under  a policy insuring trust property against fire.            PART  V.  (COPYHOLDS).  -   This part of the Bill (which enfranchises copyholdsleaving the compensation of the lord of the manor tobe worked out later) follows the &quot;scheme introduced in lord Haldane&apos;s Bill of 1915.   This scheme was fully explained in the White Paper issued in connexion withthat Bill.   Alterations have been made  in consequence of legalmortgages  (see Part I) being made to  take effect bydemise.  The historical  services incident  to Grand  andPetty  Sergeantry&quot;, which are wholly harmless,  havebeen   expressly  preserved.   In  other  respects; theoriginal scheme stands,  though the  abolition of specialcustoms of descent is now dealt with in Part VIII.     PART  VI.   (MANORIAL INCIDENTS).   This part carries out Lord  Haldane&apos;s scheme forthe extinguishment  of  manorial (incidents,  whetheraffecting land enfranchised by Part  V or other land.&apos;   Provisions have been added authorising a termin-able rentcharge to be created, if the parties so desire,in place of a  perpetual compensation rentcharge.   Asa rule  the rentcharges will be small, and it seems ex-expedient that  after a  limited time the title to the landaffected should be automatically cleared of the charge.   The provisions in  Part  III of  the  Bill  give thenecessary facilities  for the  redemptioni  or  apportion-ment of the rent.                             ,   The details of Part VI are fully explained in theWhite  Paper above  referred  to.           PART VII. (LEASEHOLDS).   This part  adopts Lord  Haldane&apos;s scheme  for theabolition of perpetually  renewable  leaseholds,  a form
of tenure as useless as it is expensive, and for the con-version  of the  leasehold  interest  into  long  terms,thereby  bringing the Lessee&apos;s  interest within the defini-tion (in  Part I.) of a &quot;legal estate.&quot;  These provisions are fully explained in the White Paper above referredto.   This part also abolishes the legal fiction of an &quot; in-teresse  termini,&quot; an  interest invented by the courts to cover the  case where,  for want of entry, a demiseto take  effect from a future date,  could not take effect as a legal term.   These interests are  now converted   into  &quot; legalestates&quot; or equitable terms as the case requires.  Butin order that in  future the title to a legal estate shouldnot  be  unduly hampered by the  creation  of  terms totake effect at a remote  date, the Bill  renders void  a legal term limited  to  take  effect more than  21 years from the date of the lease (see also  the definition of  a&quot;term of years absolute&quot; in  Part XI. of the Bill).            PART VIII. (INTESTACY).   This part is new.  Strictly  it affects  equitable in-terests as opposed to legal estates.  But as one of themain objects of the Bill is to assimilate the law of real and personal  estate, it is clear that to allow the two classes  of property  to devolve in different  ways on anintestacy would leave a distinct  flaw in the scheme.    The proposed reform is  required, first, to  abolish the  need for complicated apportionments  between thepersons  interested  in  the  two  classes of   property,secondly  to abolish the need   for  investigating thequestion whether or  not there  has  been  a conversion into money or  land, and thirdly to remove  any sus-picion  of injustice which might have  been  felt  onaccount of  the  abolition (by  this part of the Bill) ofspecial  customs of descent, such  as gavelkind.    The Memorandum prefixed to the Bill explains theproposals of the Committee in regard to the order and nature of the interests to be  taken by the beneficiaries.This however is essentially a  matter  for Parliamentto  decide.    The machinery is important for the purposes of themain scheme of the Bill. This is designed on the linesof  a properly drawn will, with a view to  eliminating the  difficulties in administration arising in consequenceof  technical  rules.    Thus  as (subject to any  life interest which may begiven to a surviving spouse) the  estate will usually bedivisible into shares, the usual  trust for sale, with fullpower  to postpone is imposed,  with the  usual provi-sions as to  retaining reversionary interests unsold andthe application  of income.  These are  needed whetherit is decided ultimately  to give  a life interest to a sur-viving spouse or not, for there may be a minority. the reference to accumulations  of  surplus income during a minority relates to the maintenance clause in Part III.of  the  Bill  amending and replacing Section  43 of theConveyancing Act, 1881.    It will be noticed that Part  IV. of the Bill suppliesa power  of  advancement, where property is held on, trust for sale.    The trust for sale also brings in all the powers  of management given by Part  I. to trustees for sale (see Fourth  Schedule)  and enables  the administrator  to override the equitable  interests which by Part I.  are made to attach to the proceeds of sale.  -  The statutory trusts for the issue  of  the  intestaterecognise the futility of vesting a share in  a beneficiary until he or  she marries or attains  full  age, for this would  involve taking out letters of administration  to the estate of a beneficiary  dying under age,  unless a settlement  is  made by  the Court  when .the  infant marries.     Part I. of the Bill (6th Schedule) gives a power to a married infant to give valid receipts  for income.    The power for a settlor or testator to make property go  in equity to the person  who  would have  been  his heir in regard to freeholds if  he  had died  intestate before  the  law was changed, is preserved by Part I. of the  Bill.  There can be no  objection to an  heir taking &quot;by purchase&quot;  as  opposed to &quot;descent&quot; any more than there can be  any  objection to the creation of an  equitable  estate tail.  In both cases it is merely a question of allowing a well-known expression to  de- note in a concise way the person to take.     In neither case will the trust affect the title to  be shewn  to a purchaser. PART  IX  (PERSONAL  REPRESENTATIVES).   This  part  is  essential to  the  main  scheme&quot; :as itdeals with the devolution of  the  legal estate as wellas equitable interests.   It substantially follows  the  corresponding; Part in lord Haldane&apos;s Bill of 1915, and maintains the general principle  that  (apart  from titles  acquired under theLimitation Acts or on a bankruptcy  see Part  I) somedocument in  writing  is requisite for evidencing  thetransfer  of a  legal estate, hence the  Bill provides thatlor this purpose an assent mustbe in  writing.  -   There are  three classes of rules relating  to theadministration of assets :        (a) Where  the  estate .is administered&quot;, out;-of   \  Court.&apos;                              :   :       (b) Where the estate is  administered in Court.       (c) Where the estate is administered  in bank-     ruptcy.                     .      &apos;;   .   .  ....   It is  proposed  in future that  the rules applicablewhen the estate is in Court  should  be applied jn allcases; this is not essential to  the scheme but is putforward  in the interest of  simplification.   The archaic practice of  granting  administration tosyndics  or  nominees  has  been revived - where  a corporation has  been  nominated  executor.  This hasled to the execution of invalid or doubtful conveyances,accordingly  a clause has  been  added under  whichprobate  or  letters  of administration  &quot;will in future begranted  direct to the  corporation.   As settled land will  under Part  1. devolve ;on the death of the  estate owner  (i.e. the tenant.for. life) tohis  personal representative, provision is made, as*was done in  Lord Haldane&apos;s Bill,  under which  adminis-tration,  confined to the settled land,  can be granted tothe  trustees of the settlement.                     ,::   The amendments consequential on mortgages beingmade to take effect (Part  I.) by  demise or subdemiseand on the alteration of. the law of intestacy (Part IX.) have been  made in this part of  the Bill.  Otherwise the  explanations given  in  the  White Paper  issued in reference to  -Lord Haldane&apos;s Bill still hold good!&apos; -          PART  X.   (LAND  TRANSFER).      &apos;    This part of the Bill is intended to give  effect to&apos; thet recommendations  of  the  Royal  Commission- -as varied by the Committee&apos;s  report, particularly in regard to the abolition  of the  &quot;  judicial &quot;  discretion  of the Registrar.  This must  not be confused with the dis- cretion  vested in him to give  effect to the wishes of the parties affected,  which is all to  the  good. 1 For though  the aim of all reform  of the land laws must be simplification, still that must  not be insisted  on to such an extent  as to impede the carrying out-of the ever changing requirements  of the  public, hence real elasticity behind the curtain either of  a register; a settlement  or a trust  for  sale, seems to be  essential and unobjectionable. -  i The  abolition of undivided shares (see Part I of the Bill) enables  the land to be registered  in themames&apos; of the trustees for  sale,  this will best be  done as soon as a dealing takes place.  At the same time charges regis- tered in  respect  of undivided shares will be struck off the register,  as  these will  take effect behind  the.trust. for  sale in respect.of the proceeds of sale.  The prin- ciple adopted is  that when  a dealing takes- place in the register, the old  entries therein should so far as possible be made to conform  to the entries  which  would&apos;have been made if first registration had taken place after the Bill had  come into force.  This  will make for uni- formity of practice.    The  provisions  in Part I of the Bill  under which mortgages are to take  effect  by  demise or subdemise will remove  one of the blots on the system set up by the Land Transfer Acts.                          :&apos;  .   Formerly the registered proprietor of the land could&apos; transfer the  land absolutely to a mortgagee,  who. was&apos; registered as proprietor, with the result that the owner of the equity of redemption was unable  to  deal with the land at all on the register.  This will now become impossible.     The method of mortgaging registered land,  after the Bill is passed will  be  :          (i)  By a registered  charge, in almost  any form,     which will  operate by demise  or  subdemise.         (ii) By a mortgage  deed by demise or  subdemise      (in  almost  any form)  protected by a caution in a      specially prescribed form  which  gives  the mort-      gagee a right to have the mortgage  registered as
    a charge as of the date of the caution.   This gives    tho mortgagee time to ascertain whether the mort-    gage is  likely  to be of a permanent nature before    he registers.       (iii) By an equitable  charge  (under hand) pro-    tected by  an ordinary  caution.       (iv) By a  deposit of  the land certificate, with    or without title deeds according  to whether  the    title  registered is possessory  or absolute.   This    can be protected by a notice having  practically the    same effect as an ordinary caution.   The amendments (in Part I) relating to settlementssimplify  all  dealings with settled land.   The custodiantrustee (i.e.,  the tenant for life or statutory owner) inwhom the fee simple or term of years absolute will be vested, will be the person  to be registered,  subject toa restriction  providing that capital money shall  bepaid to the persons named  in the  restriction.  Theywill  be the trustees of the settlement.  If  there is acompound  settlement the trustees  of  such  settlementwill  be named in the restriction, thus  all  &quot;equitableinterests&quot;  which  take effect  under   the  compoundsettlement  will be &quot;protected  by the restriction withoutfurther entries on the register.   It will be observed that Parts I  and II of the  Billlargely increase the possible number of settlements,  forwhenever an  equitable interest affects a  legal estate,the absolute owner of that estate (assuming that it isnot held  on  trust for sale) is given the statutory powersof a tenant for life,  hence the equitable  interest  willbe properly  protected if the usual &quot;settled  land restric-tion  &quot;  is placed  on the register.  This does not fetterthe proprietor^ power to deal with the legal estate onthe  register,  but  makes  the capital money safe.  Ithas  to be paid (unless a corporation is the trustee ofthe settlement) to at least  two trustees.  It is obviousthat no injustice arises by shifting the equitable inter-est  from the land and  reimposing it on  the capitalmoney and  securities which  represent the land.   If the land is held on trust for sale the trustees forsale  will be registered as proprietors.  They are given(Part I)  the statutory powers of a tenant  for life,  andwill  be able  to override equitable interests,  which arereimposed on the  capital money and securities arisingfrom any transaction carried out by the trustees.   Inthis  case no &quot;settled land restriction&quot; will  be required;moreover, the fact that (unless the trustee  for sale isa corporation) the money must be paid to at least twotrustees, renders  a caution  unnecessary.  A  trusteecannot be  discharged from  his trust  unless  at  least two  trustees are left to administer  the trust.   Under the Acts, as they  at present  stand,  the pro-proprietor of the land, in right of his registration,  has very inadequate powers.   Thus, apart  from  his titleoff the register, he cannot, for instance, grant a leaseor grant or reserve a perpetual rentcharge for a termof years absolute, or an  easement  right  or  privilege,with the result that the title off the register has to be investigated  on  such occasions, at  any rate  back tothe  last registered  transfer for  value.  All  this isremedied by  the Bill.  In  future the  registered pro-proprietor will be able to carry  out on  the register, inrelation to the registered legal estate, all  transactions which under Part I.  of the  Bill the owner of a legal estate  has  power  to  transact.   Even in  the  case of settled  land this will  holdgood, for under Part II. of the Bill  it is proposed thatthe Court or the trustees should be able to  consent toany  reasonable transaction,  which may  not happen tocome within any  of the express powers.   Further, under the Bill,  it will always be possibleto ascertain where the legal  estate is by an inspection of the register.   This  is  made possible  by the pro-visions in  Part I. relating  to  mortgages  and to thegetting in of bare  outstanding legal  estates.   Even where a title has  been acquired  under  theLimitation  Acts the  legal estate will remain in  the registered proprietor, though he is made a trustee forthe person who acquires a title by long possession.  Itis  obvious that,  subject  to this  exception,  the  onlyproper function of the register is  to  take the place of the  documentary  title.   It may be claimed  that, in England, registration of title  should be the  last step if complete simplification-tion of  title  is to be achieved.  For as  has  been ex-plained  above, no amendment of the  general law apartfrom a  register:        (a) Can  wholly abolish investigation or  rein-    investigation of the title to legal estates, though this    can, without a register, be reduced to a simple and    short process bv shortening the period of investiga-    tion,   by reducing   the   number of  documents    material to the title and by shortening and  freeing    those documents from technicalities.       (b) No state guarantee against fraud  or mis-    take can  be given without the aid of a register.   It may be admitted that the cases (if any) in which an insurance against a flaw in a title to a &quot; legal estate &quot;(not a reversionary or contingent interest) is requiredare negligible.   Also that,  with a  system freed from  technicalities,the chances of mistakes, of any consequence, occurringmay be taken to  be remote.   On the other hand registration  of title eliminatesthe risk (however small in practice it may be) of fraudor mistake by the  suppression of  deeds  affecting thelegal estate,  to the same  extent as a register  of deeds.For instance it prevents a second or subsequent mort-gage from being  overlooked.        (c) No official  description  of the land  dealt    with, to  which reference can safely be made  from     time  to  time without repeating the description,     can be secured without the aid  of a register.   All  other reforms  (speaking  generally)  can  beeffected without  a  register.    Now  whether or  not, after   the law  has  been amended,  the cost of  conveyancing  in relation to un-registered land will be more or less than  that incurred in  relation to registered  land must  remain  an  openquestion till  the  two  systems  have  been tested.    Itmay be that the  costs of the registration system  must remain  high  so  long  as  the special costs  involved  in first registration  have to  be paid.  If so  then the testcan only be made by keeping a separate  record of thetime  expended,  etc.,  in an area in  which nearly thewhole of the land has been  registered.   If the  cost test cannot, or is not to be  applied, then the question whnthn- a complete-system of simplificationof title  is or is not&apos;to be  gradually introduced (no onesuggests that anything but a  gradual process  is pos-sible in  this country) by compulsory orders must dependon ^ whether  those responsible  consider that a  system which only falls short  of  perfection on the three pointsenumerated  above,  is  or is  not  sufficient  for thiscountry.   No doubt other  debatable points arise but the rootof the whole  question is  as stated above.   The  new procedure  proposed in connexion with compulsory orders  is fully stated in  the Committee&apos;sreport, as also the recommendations which in any wayconflict  with those made  by the Royal Commission.   In other respects the explanations given in the white paper issued with Lord FIaldane&apos;s Bill of 1915 apply  tothis part of the Bill.              PART XI. (GENERAL).    This part contains  the definitions required in thewhole or in  different  parts of the Bill.    As explained  in  the Memorandum prefixed  to theBill,  it  is not proposed that this measure should  comeinto force till 1921, as time is  required for Consolidat-ing Bills to  be  passed and for rules to  be prescribed by   the  Court,   by   the  Board  of  Agriculture  andFisheries, and by  the  Rule  Committee  under theLand Transfer Acts.   This will also give time for textwriters to explain  the measure to the profession.                             BENJ. L.  CHERRY.Printed by His MAJESTY&apos;S  STATIONERY OFFICE.
