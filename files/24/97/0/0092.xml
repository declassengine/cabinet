E. S. M.       (1) Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, dated IQtli January 1920.    w     Following is full summary of address to be presented to me  to-day by Khilafat deputation, including,  amongst  others,  following persons of note: Shaukat Ali, lately  released  and elected President, Khilafat Congress,  Amritsar;  his brother, Mahumad Ali Ajmal Khan, President, All-India  Moslem League, Amritsar; Dr. Ansari Abdul Bari, Lucknow;  Seth M. M.  Chotani, Bombay;  Abdul  Kalam  Azad, lately released; Dr. Kitchlew and Rambuujdat Chaudhri, lately released; Gandhi Swami Shraddanand Hasrat Mohani :      1.  Khilafat Conference  (? press  for)  deputation  to  England  to lay before His Majesty and Ministers clear  statement of the obligations imposed  on every Muslim by their faith and united wishes of  Indian Muslims regarding Khilafat Muslims&apos; control of  whole Jazirat-ul-Arab, Khalifa&apos;s  wardenship of  holy places  and  integrity of Ottoman Empire.   Necessity, enhanced by  present grave  situation, fast developing into unmistakable menace.     2.  After horrors and bloodshed of war, lasting peace  was expected at the earliest possible moment, but great delay has occurred in regard to Turkey and Asia, now  on the verge of storm which must effect Muslim world.                             .  ,     3.  At this, statesmen of Empire must in concluding settlement take into fall account binding religious  obligations and cherished sentiments of 70  millions Indian Muslims and sympathies of 250 millions Hindu compatriots.     4. During war-time these sympathies were not expressed with  sufficient force; and it  is regretted even more that religious obligations were not emphasised to ruling- class of alien faith.   (?) discuss reason for this omission, but since  armistice clearer exposition of doctrines essential to salvation of  Mussalmans has been made.     5. Recognises increasing appreciation of  deep Mussalman concern  in  Turkish settlement, and thankfully acknowledges repeated representations made by Government of India and Secretary of State for India, on their behalf to His Majesty&apos;s Government, but latter  is too far removed for  Indian  Mussalmans to  influence its  opinions or pre-conceived ideas appreciably,  and  British Ministers seem from, their  utterances, disposed to consider British  and Christian aspects only in  making settlement.    6. In these circumstances, one final effort necessary to warn Imperial authorities of danger of settlement forced on Mussalmans contrary to  clearest commandments of , their creed, and entreat  His  Majesty&apos;s Government to avoid evil consequences of  such a decision.                                                    .&apos;    7. Deputation to England only, effective method  of  placing directly before His Majesty and Ministers, and it is hoped also,  Allied  and  associated nations;  humble, but frank submissions of the binding force of Islamic obligations,  and the scope for Muslim aspiration.    8. Recalls  conditions of peace laid  down  by President of United  States, and accepted by Khilafat; and pledge of  British Premier regarding Constantinople, Thrace     io 895    100   2/20                 A
   and Turkish  homelands.   If  these  pledges unredeemed or whittled&apos; down, moral   prestige of Empire  will be undermined to an extent  for  which,  no  territorial  or   political gains will compensate.  Reference also made in same connection to  pledges   proclaimed by Lord  Hardinge.  :       9.  Apart from  possible non-redemption of  such pledges, Mussulmans of  India   most deeply concerned, because, settlement is apparently being  outlined which  no   Mussahnan could&apos;accept without jeopardising his eternal salvation.       10. Temporal power is very essence of Khilafat, and Mussalmans can never agree   to any change in its  character or dismemberment of its Empire.       11. No kind of non-Muslim control of Jazirat-ul-Arab can be tolerated by Islamic   faith.       12. Khalifa alone can he warden of holy places.       13. The action  of Mussalmans of Arabia in  infringing integrity  of Khalifa&apos;s   dominions is condemned by rest of Muslim world.   It  is duty of Indian Mussalmans   to remove cause of difference between Arabs and other Muslims.       14. All Mussalmans are interested in seeing that principles of self-determination   are  applied  to Muslims  equally  with Christians, and to  Asiatics  equally with   Europeans.       15. In spite of  charges to contrary, based on prejudice mid on  bitterness  of   recent growth, verdict of history will vindicate alike the basic toleration of Islam and   essential humanity of Turks.       16. Loyalty of Indian Mussalmans, which has been asset of British rule, is mainly   based on  preservation  of  their  religious  freedom.  Justice and expediency  alike   demand that no change  shall be made in what  is unalterable and has  been unaltered&apos;   for 13  centuries of Islam, though  changes  may  be possible  in what is changeable,   under which latter head Muslim sentiment may be sacrificed to Imperial requirements,   though  such sentiments should be considered.   Requirements  of  Islamic law are,   however^ so binding  that they cannot be reduced  by hair&apos;s  breadth to suit desire  of   Allied Powers.       17.  But  Indian  Mussalmans  take their stand also on Imperial  interests which   necessitate that settlement should be acceptable alike to Muslim and non-M&apos;uslims  of   India, now happily re-united.  Imperial authorities should not underrate  the value  of   Islamic  friendship and Indian loyalty.&apos;  A settlement not acceptable to India would   bring no peace,  and every Muslim would  know  no rest  and could only aspire  to  salvation by following dictates of Islam however painful their consequences.       ]8.  Just appreciation  of Islamic  obligations  and Muslim  sentiments  in  this   matter,  coupled with  generous recognition of India&apos;s fitness for responsible local self-  government will, on contrary, add immensely to power  of British Empire, and make  world safe,.not only (    ?     ), also for God and truth.       .19.  Once  success of our mission  is assured,  it will be our business to reassure  distracted Muslims and promote peace of whole world.       Abstract of my reply will follow.       (? Proportion) expresses viewrs of  extremist section, but it is undoubted that all  Moslem  India feels very deeply on this Turkish question and sympathises very largely  with the general views expressed on the future of Turkey.                 (2) Telegram from Viceroy, dated 2Qlh January 1920.       Private.  Following is  summary  of my reply to Mahommedan deputation: I  Avelcomed opportunity of hearing their views on the subject of Turkish peace terms,  and also of explaining to Indian  Mahonmiedans attitude  of  Government of  India,  efforts made by them and  Secretary of  State to  secure adequate representation of  Indian  Muslim  feeling  before Peace Conference, and  our genuine  sympathy  with&apos;  them in present difficult position.   Explained we had no secret information regarding  probable nature of decision, and  we warned  them  not to place  reliance on  cabled   newspaper reports which in no sense represented opinions of His Majesty&apos;s Minister.  Secretary of State is now  in Paris with Prime Minister pressing views of  Indian  Muslims with  accustomed  energy  and  force, and  decision may  come any moment.
No effort  lias  been spared to place before those with  whom  decision will restplea of Indian Mahominedans for most  favourable  possible treatment of Turkey.Repeated  extracts from  my Council speech  ol: 3rd September at Simla on same subject, and drew attention to Secretary of State&apos;s recent utterance in Press interviewto the  same effect.   Thanked  them for &quot;their acknowledgment of  these  efforts.Proceeded  to  explain  efforts made  in   further detail, saying  that  representationwas made soon  after armistice that Indian Muslims  feel much  disturbed over Turkishpeace terms, partially with regard to holy places in Hecljaz  and Koweit, and  ofConstantinople,  and therefore  necessary  to secure  full statement of their   views before  Peace  Conference.   Indian  Delegation  composed of  Secretary  of   State,Bikaner, and Sinha pressed case for  favourable treatment of Turkey with  uusur-passable earnestness of purpose and  force and  argument.   Delegation (? had the)assistance of memorial of 1st January signed by  prominent Mahommedans, includingAga Khan, Ameer Ali, Sir  Abbas  Ali Baig, and Yusuf Ali,  and at hearing  before.Conference were accompanied by Aga  Khan, Sahibzada  Aftab Ahmed  Khan, andYusuf Ali.   Same month we again called urging  importance of considering effect  of settlement  on  Indian Muslims&apos; opinion.   Have  been in unceasing communicationprivately since with Secretary of State whose  views  coincide closely with my own.Matter, however, is  not  one for  British  Cabinet only (? but for) other great Powersinvolved.   Decision of Turkey to join,  enemy undoubtedly prolonged  war and increased its grievous misery.  Trust tribunal  of allied Powers  will now pronouncejudgment.   Turning next  to terms of address  repeated my  sincere sympathy withtheir troubles and difficulties.     Could not admit validity of all their  contentions, but mo advantage  would  be gained by argumentative examination of memorial by paragraphs.     Recognised that Muslims of  India feel  very  deeply on  the subject, and occasionnot one for unprofitable controversy but for helpful co-operation.     Promised to do whatever  possible  to help them  in  sending mission,  but  asdecision may come at  any moment recognising need for speed  for this have alreadycabled full summary of memorial to  Secretary of  State as this may strengthen his hands.   Expressed  my  profound  confidence  that   whatever may  be decision,Mahommedans  of  India will  remain staunch in  allegiance and  loyalty to  King-Emperor.  In great war they made generous  and whole-hearted response to  call of empire.  Their loyalty and assistance has  been  of greatest value, and thousands  ofMuslim soldiers gave their lives gallantly for India and the Crown  in many theatres of war.  Now that victory is  won confident that Indian Muslims will not waver inattitude of steadfast loyalty to His Majesty.     Reaffirmed  previous declaration on  question of  Khilafat as matter for Mahcm-medans only to decide.  But  contention  that Turkey should (? keep) full integrity of pre-war sovereignty and dominions could not reasonably be expected  to be recognised.Before war His Majesty&apos;s Government offered  to guarantee such integrity, but afterdefeat Turkey  (? could not) expect any more than  other  enemy Powers  wholly  to escape consequences of her action.     Fully  realised  this must  be matter, of grief  to Indian Muslims and ended asfollows:      (Take R.)   I would however ask  them to take a practical view  and a long viewof the situation (corrupt group) letting  them  remember that  when this unhappy war broke  out  it was unmistakably  wish of  every  Briton  to  maintain the  old  ties  of friendship which bound together the British Empire  and  Turkish Empire.  Wecould  so  well  have trod  together  the  same path  and  have  emerged  victoriousfrom the  struggle side by side.   Unhappily those in  whose  hands the destinies ofTurkey rested  at that  supreme  moment  chose to join our enemies.   That action andits consequences have created difficult problems  which now confront us.  But as yourightly indicate in your address there is a community of interests and a long tradition of friendship  between British and Turkish Empires.   I look forward therefore to atime when  our old relations with  Turkish  Empire  will  be  re-established  andrestored on a basis of mutual advantage  and mutual goodwill.   Do not let your mindsbe too much overclouded by passing shadows of  to-day, when  the whole world is in astate of flux and everyone of us, of whatever class,  nation, or creed, feels buffeted andtorn by events it has been our lot to pass through.  Take  a long view.  (Corruptgroup)  good, will and must survive.     Meanwhile from deadly struggle in  which  world has  been  engaged,  BritishEmpire  has emerged strong as  ever.    (? Within   that  perfectly)  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, religion and  lives and property of Muslims have  been secured.   Within                                      A 2
 it  and  beyond it there  will still be an assured  future  for  Islam and  peace and prosperity as in past for all Muslims.     The future of India is now bright with promise.   We are on  the eve  of  a  great experiment which, if wisely guided,  will give India a high place among countries of the world.  For its success and for ordered progress of this great country enabling it to withstand dangerous menace of social and  political disorder now overshadowing the East the fullest co-operation of Muslim India is essential.     Offering you my sympathy and my help in trouble that has brought you here to-day I require  your aid and  co-operation in the  great task which  now calls  for our united energies.       (3) Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, dated 28th January 1920.     Following  is  rejoinder of Khilafat  deputation to His Excellency&apos;s reply of 20th instant: .                   * .     &quot; Viceroy&apos;s  reply,  whilst  perfectly  courteous,  was equally disappointing  in that His Excellency said in emphatic language  that Turkey, when she had her choice, deliberately drew  sword  against  Allied  Powers, and  must take consequences.  We consider this  means punishment for Turkey for having  joined Central  Powers contrary to  solemn  declaration  made by Mr.  Asquith, then  Prime Alinister,  after Turkey  had so made her choice, His Excellency  hoped that whatever the decision, Indian Muslims&apos; loyalty  would  remain  as staunch as ever.  We desire to place on record our firm conviction that should the peace terms result unfavourably to  Muslim religion and  sentiments, they would place undue   train upon Muslim loyalty, and knowing as we do universal feeling in India as  men with full sense of responsibilHy, is it not possible  for us to  give assurance His. Excellency expected ?  It is due  to Peace Conference  now sitting, to ourselves and to  Empire, to  which we desire to remain  loyal,  to  state in  explicit language  minimum  that  will  satisfy  Muslim sentiments.   Arabia delimited by;Moslem authorities and  holy places of Islam must remain under  control of Khalifa, full guarantee  being  taken, consistent  with the dignity of sovereign State, for genuine Arabian  self-government, should Arabs desire it.   We  advisedly  use word genuine because  present arrangement is  thoroughly. distrusted by overwhelming majority of intelligent  Muslim opinion.  Islam has ever associated temporal power with Khilafat.  We therefore consider that to make Sultan mere  puppet,  would, add  insult  to injury,   and would  only be  understood  by Indian Muslims as affront given them by combination  of Christian  Powers.   Whilst, therefore, we must insist on pledge given by Mr. Lloyd George on 5th January  1918, being  fulfilled in.  order to show that&apos;we desire no  more than strictest justice,  we concede  right  of  Allied  Powers to ask for such guarantees as may be  considered necessary for full protection of non-Muslim races living under Sultan.  We hope even at this eleventh hour that British  Ministers will give clue weight to, and  appreciate Muslim  sentiment  in India,  supported as  it is by practically whole of enlightened Hindu opinion.  His  Excellency has  stated that it is just possible peace terms may be completed and  declared within few days, and  we can only hope that it is not yet too late  to mend  what mistake  may have  been committed.   We  claim that  British Imperial  Government is  as  much trustee for  Muslim--and  Indian interests  as for Christian. Therefore not enough that our sentiment and wishes are  placed before league, but essential that  British Ministers make our case their own.&quot;   .    (4) Telegram from  Viceroy, Home Department, dated 28lh January 1920.     Continuation  of  telegram sending copy of Khilafat deputation  rejoinder.  It.  is too parly to estimate effect upon Indian Muslim opinion of His Excellency&apos;s reply to the Khilafat deputation, hut speech has had favourable reception from many sections  of Press,  English and Indian.   All  admit  very sympathetic&apos;nature of reply, and even. Extremist papers acknowledge completeness of efforts made by His Excellency and Secretary of State to place Muslim,  case before British Cabinet  and  Peace Conference, though they go on to suggest that more than sympathetic Avords  are necessary, and that if Britain fulfils  pledges  and throws whole Weight of  her  influence into scale  at Peace Conference,  result desired by Indian Muslims will be secured.  In this conjiec^ tion His Excellency has issued to Press a public and emphatic denial  of  statements and rumours to effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government have been pressing at Paris forexpulsion of, Turks  from Europe.   Viceroy notes  with regret indications in latestPress telegrams that settlement of Turkish peace terms is likely to be further delayed.This&apos;will tend to make situation more difficult iii- India,&apos;-giving  further opportunity  to
present Khilafat agitators.   We have, as  promised, assisted, deputation to best of our ability  to get passages,  and understand  that following will sail by Austrian-Lloydsteamer Trustina, leaving Bombay  on 1st  February : Mohmad Ali, Sir FazulbhoyCurrimbhoy,  (corrupt group)-clepe  Hossain  Maulana  Suliman  and Hyat.    their destination is Marseilles,  where they expect to meet Aga Khan.  A sufficient number,including Shaukat Ali and1 other released leaders, as well as  Hindu (? sympathisers)like Gandhi, remaining  behind to (? continue)  agitation.  Ali brothers  are  visitingprincipal Mohamedan centres to collect funds as  reported in our telegram of the 27thinstant.     His Excellency will be  glad (if)  Secretary of State  can give him any forecast, of probable or approximate date by which  announcement of final  settlement may beexpected.                          &apos;                                  .         :     As previously desired, he would like to have information regarding actual  peace terms  as long as possible in advance,  so  as  to  make necessary preparations inconsultation with Local Government for announcement to public.  (5) Part of a Telegram  from Viceroy, Home Department, dated 2nd February. 1920..     In continuation of previous telegrams regarding  Mohamedan feeling in respect of turkish Peace terms, we consider it necessary to furnish you  with clear appreciation of present position in  the hope that it may assist  you  to expedite the  decision, as wellas  to influence the final settlement.   The prolonged,  uncertainty has  undoubtedlyaffected  adversely the attitude  of many  Mohamedans  who,  six  months  ago,  wereprepared to &quot;accept decision of Allied  Powers with  resignation, recognising  Turkey&apos;could not escape  inevitable  consequences of her  Khalifa&apos;misdeeds and mistakes, butare  now in much less  acquiescent  mood.  All  Mohamedans  are  naturally full o&apos;fsympathy for co-religionists, and have had time  to  brood over expected downfall of only independent Moslem  Power achieved partly by aid  of:  Indian Moslem troops:Meanwhile  fanatical  Extremists  have  been appealing  to  religious passions ofMohamedan masses,  representing that  acceptance  of  any  diminution  of  Khalifsprevious authority and dominions would be contrary  to cardinal principles of  Islamicfaith.   This is new doctrine which is being  worked  up by anti-British propagandists-among Mohamedans who. in past times have  betrayed no great interest in fortunes ofOttoman Empire.     .We have endeavoured  to counteract it by  newspaper propaganda but religious;fanatics are not  open to reason or ruled by logic,  and result is that although the agitation now so prevalent is, in our  opinion, largely  artificial, it is making headways-many Mohamedans are in self-defence forced to fall in with Extremist section  and thesituation is viewed Avith  anxiety  by  conservative Mussulman  leadens who are losing.much of their influence.     First trial, of strength  occurred over peace  celebrations  from  which there Avasmarked abstention of  Mohamedans in most large  towns  of Northern India.  Defectionof  Mohamedans was stimulated, by co-operation  of Extremist  Hindu politicians whorecognising in Moslem discontent useful weapon for anti-Government agitation&apos; andhave been pressing appeal to Moslem-Hindu, unity and  professing profound, symapathy for Moslem aspirations for  preservation of turkey&apos;s  integrity.  Example of  NizahrsGovernment and other  Moslem  States and the  fact that  there  was[ little time towork up the agitation made the opposition less effective than it might otherwise havebeen. ;                .                   ;     Next noteworthy development&apos;was meeting of Moslem  league  aud  All-IndiaKhilafat conference at Amritsar,  when Extremist Hindus and fanatical Muslims gaveutterance to coincident  sentiments both on general politics  and Khalifat question:;Enthusiasm of both was fanned by release of political offenders under amnesty.  &quot;We,included Ali brothers in this concession because we thought their continued detentionwhen contrasted with release of Hindu leaders would further  embitter Mohamedans;.&apos;They have, however, used their liberty to work up increased agitation over&apos; Khalifatquestion and to stir up Mohamedan masses with appeals which border closely  on call for Jehad or Hijrat.   They  are now  holding meetings  at chief Mohamedan  eentresfor collection of funds which are professedly to be devoted to  expenses  of  Khalifatdeputation  to  London,  Paris,  and  Turkey.&apos; Full summaries  of  recent  Khalifat,memorial of Viceroy&apos;s reply and  of rejoinder of Khalifat deputation have  alreadybeen telegraphed. As intimated in our telegram of the  29th  ultimo, Viceroy&apos;s  reply1has had good reception.in Press, and his emphatic denial of reports that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have been pressing  for, expulsion  of  Turkish  Government; from  Europehas also been published widely.
                (6) Extract from the &quot; Times &quot; of itlt February 1920.                               Dangers to be Avoided.                           A WARNING AGAINST PROMISES.                   (From our own correspondent at Constantinople.)     The proverb admonishes you against trying to teach your grandmother to  suck ^ggs.   The rule is  an excellent one, but when grandmamma has been brought up in very select diplomatic circles where nobody has  sucked an egg for generations, may not an exception  be  allowed ?  This consideration emboldens the writer to make certain suggestions as to the details of the terms of peace which will sooner or  later be imposed upon Turkey.     This peace will have two objects political and military.  The political object is to deprive Turkey  of the guardianship of the Straits, which  she has abused, and to substitute for the old  Turkish Imperialist system  of government in the interests of the Turkish official class alone a new political order based upon the  creation, where practicable, of  new States, and otherwise  of mandatory areas which may become States, and the administrative organisation of wdiat remains of the Turkish Empire.     The main lines of the settlement have no doubt been laid down by the statesmen of Great Britain, France and Italy.  They are not  known here, but their outlines can be perceived.   The Straits will  he internationalised, the Arab lands  separated under native Governments or European  mandatories from  the Turkish  realm, and  the Marches between Turk and  Arab, where Arab, Turk, Armenian, Kurd, and Circassian colonist, divided by racial feuds and split up into countless sects, will otherwise cause endless trouble, wnTbe assigned to France as mandatory Power.     An Armenian State, based on Erivan- less than the &quot; Great Armenia &quot; for which there are not enough Armenians, but comprising a large share of the &quot; six vilayets &quot;  will be created on the eastern flank of the Osmanli State of Anatolia.  Perhaps, too, the Kurd wall be allowed to form a buffer between  Turkey and Persia.     The future  of  Smyrna, perhaps of  Constantinople, remains uncertain.  In the former case, whatever  be thought of the  wisdom of allowing  the Hellenes  to occupy Smyrna and part of its Hinterland in the  first instance, it is quite clear that the Greek Army will have to remain there  at least until Turkey has complied with the demands of the  Allies, since it furnishes  the latter with an effective means of pressure upon Mustafa KemaPs armistice breakers of the extreme Nationalist  Party, who, to judge from their declarations, will find any conceivable terms of peace too severe.                *         -   PLEBISCITES  OUT OP PLACE.     But it is to be hoped that neither here nor in the &quot; Six Vilayets &quot; will  the Entente Powers sanction  any form  of  plebiscite.  Such an experiment will  result either in massacres designed to create ethnographical  &quot; facts &quot; or in simian tricks such as that in which Mustafa KemaPs lieutenant, Kiazim Karabekir, Commander  of the Erzerum Army Corps, indulged when he allowed a number of his demobilised troops, amounting probably to 20,000, to  settle  in deserted   Kurd  and  Armenian villages on  the trans caucasian border and south and east of Erzerum,  where before the war  Turks were in a great minority as compared with Armenians and Kurds.     As for Constantinople,  one thing is quite clear, namely,  that the bulk of the Effendi class,  which alone  counts  politically in Turkey, is convinced that Constan- tinople is( the only city  in  the  Empire worth inhabiting, and will consent  to great sacrifices and concessions if permitted to remain there.  Separate Constantinople from Turkey and you  supply the extremist leaders with a host of recruits.  Leave it to the Turks  as  their  capital,  under strict European control,  of course, and  you greatly diminish the number of persons AVIIO will die or pay other  people to  die  for Cilicia, Armenia or even Smyrna.     A  number of Greeks and Armenians  will necessarily remain in  Turkey proper. The Powers may be  trusted  to take steps for the protection  of these minorities and the Porte itself  is  elaborating a law ad  hoc !  But may a word be said  for Moslem minorities ? The Circassians have ideas of local autonomy for some of their numerous colonies, and  their  importance  in Moslem Turkey  is sufficient to justify attention to some of their demands.    Then there are the numerous Moslem dissenters generally known as  Kiz.il Bash,who form quite large minorities in the Moslem population  of certain Sanjaks.  They
-are generally of Sliiah affinities&apos; in their belief, no one has ever accused them of anti-Christian fanaticism, and they have had  to  suffer off  and  on from much pettypersecution on the part of non-conformity hating officials and  divines, who have been particularly  hard  during the war on the Ismailis who  own the Aga  Khan as their chief, and the non-conformist Kurds of the Dersim.  These  elements seem to deserve.some assistance from Europe.                                PAPER REFORMS.     As regards  the  &quot; control&quot; of the. Turkish administration by  one or  moremandatories,  it is certain that  all the  official  vested interests will do their best towhittle it down to mere advice.   One cannot blame them for seeking to save &quot;face,&quot;but what the Indian and British signatories of the memorandum to the Prime minister on the subject of Turkey, published in the Times of 21th December, do not seem torecognize is, that  while Turkey has repeatedly &quot; asked for the  services &quot; of competentEuropeans she has  never allowed them a  free hand.  The  writer has  seen  manyadvisers come and go, but none of  them  was ever  able to  secure the punishment ofimportant or unimportant official criminals wdio had friends in  the  Central Committeeof Union and  Progress,  and when  the war  broke  out they and  their  reformsdisappeared amid an orgy of corruption, violence, and extortion.     The administration is at present more corrupt and  demoralised  than at any previous time since  1908, and  since  Turkey&apos;s  alarming financial position furnishesthe Powers with a lever for obtaining  more  extended powers  for foreign advisers, itis to be hoped that they will avail themselves of it.   Otherwise we shall see  a  greatoutput of paper reforms  which a change of  Government may  render inoperative if it;so pleases the Effendi class.     The military object  of the  peace terms is to  deprive Turkey of all power ofaggressive action  against her  future neighbours.  Part of the Turkish Army has. beendisarmed; and the regular forces which Mustafa  Kemal controls  have  no  great storeof Turkish equipment.  But there is reason to believe that large quantities of Germanmaterial  remain in the country, and the appeal  of the Rumanian Government for therestitution of the  arms and munitions handed over to the Turks, together with  muchmachinery, by Marshal von Mackensen in 1916-17,  has so far been refused by  theWestern  Powers on the ground that the terms of the Turkish armistice do not providefor it.  -     But this military material must be surrendered and Turkey  must not  be  allowedto erect  ammunition factories in the interior,  if Anatolia  is to be prevented from becoming a centre of the arms traffic  in the Near  and Middle  East.  To this endfurther surrenders, especially of  rifles  and small arms- ammunition, will  have  to be demanded.    Neither Great Britain nor France has any interest in  tolerating  theimportation of arms into Cilicia, Persia, Mesopotamia, or Kurdistan.
