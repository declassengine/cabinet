THIS DOG UiSiENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC AlA JEii-TY&apos; S GQVERNI:EHT i.SECRET. COPY NO.CP.  79(27).--- CABINET.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS.Memorandum Vy the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster,78(27),The Draft Convention on the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments which has been agreed to by the Committee of Imperial Defence represents the result of prolonged consideration in the Disarmament Sub-Committee of that body and a further discussion in the Committee of Imperial4Defence itself.      It is a compromise between the views of the fighting Services and those who believe that an international agreement for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments is essential for the safety of European civilisation and the existence of the British Empire.      Jt follows that the Draft is not satisfactory to those who like myself hold the latter view.      In particular I think it regrettable that it  contains no provision limiting the material of land armies, that the limitation of aircraft is   confined to shore-based metropolitan forces,  that naval and air personnel are not dealt with at all, and that the provisions for international supervision are so insufficient.      However,  it does represent a step in advance - albeit a very small one.It does not contain any figures of the reduction to be agreed to which are to be the subject of further negotiations before the Disarmament conference itself meets, probably in the autumn*      If President Coolidge&apos;s proposed conference takes place in June any agreement there arrived
at will not only be binding on the parties to that conference as a separate agreement amongst themselves, but will also in the event of the proposed Convention, or something like it being accepted at the forthcoming meeting at Geneva, be the basic of any naval limitation that may appear in the final Disarmament TreatyaIn conclusion I desire to place on record my conviction that at no time in the last three or four centuries has the British Empire been in such peril as it is at the present time      It is true that the peril is not immediate..      There is no prospect of any serious war at the moment.      But if it comes, and we are engaged in it, the fabric of credit and confidence by which we live can scarcely be expected to survive itc     Further, we are for the first time exposed to direct attack against which our Fleet gives us no protection.. An air bombardment of London by explosives, incendiary substance and poison gas is admittedly a fearful menace for which there is no defence other than the threat of similar bombardmient abroad.      In thoso circumstances the recrudescence of competition in arma.ments of which there are many signs a grave dangern      Unless arrested it is bound to lead to war0 To avert that result is worth many sacrifices and even, as a lesser evil, the acceptance of some risko7 th March,  1927,
