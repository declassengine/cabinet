SECRET. Copy No.    30CP. 70 (27).CABINET.INDIAN WAR SETTLEMENT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(Previous Paper : CP. 69 (27).)I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum prepared in the Treasury under my direction upon a number of important outstanding disputes between the British and Indian Governments and between the War Office and the India Office.I do not think it is necessary for the Cabinet to go into the details or merits of the various contentions. Naturally the Treasury hold strongly that the British taxpayer is being unjustly treated. But a similar view may well be taken by the India Office in favour of the great interests committed to their charge. No one ought to be the final judge of his own case. I, therefore, ask that the matter should be submitted for decision to an impartial Arbitrator of high standing, by whose award the Treasury is willing to be bound. I am even willing to leave the choice of the Arbitrator to Lord Birkenhead, being sure that he will choose justly. In this way a right decision can be reached and a long and discreditable wrangle between Government Departments ended.I should like to point out that if this dispute was with a foreign country like the United States or France, we should certainly have proposed arbitration, and would have regarded ourselves in a strong position if it were refused by the other country.     It is a dispute not about policy or sentiment but about fact and good faith.     The claims in question are claims  arising out of agreements, expressed or implied, between India and Great Britain.     What is the fair interpretation of these agreements, and how is their interpretation to be achieved ? Disputes  have  arisen  on  money  matters  betoveen  the  Mother   country  and the various Dominions.   These have usually been adjusted by mutual concessions; but our weapon in the face of unreasonable treatment has always been to propose impartial arbitration.   This has frequently been accepted.   Only last December Mr. McKenzie King bowed at once to my suggestion of arbitration on a batch of outstanding Anglo-Canadian financial questions arising out of the War.   He did not like it because he was afraid he would lose, but, at the same time, he said, &quot; Failing agreement, the demand for arbitration is one we cannot resist.&quot;   So here you have a procedure the principle of which is certainly increasingly commended by modern opinion, which can be applied to our relations with foreign countries and to our relations with our own Dominions.  Why should this procedure not be applied to disputes between two Departments of State ?    If not, what procedure is available ?   Is the most reasonable party to give way and assume an unfair burden ? Is the deadlock which has lasted for seven or eight years to be prolonged indefinitely?   Is the Cabinet itself to sit in judgment and give a decision on the merits ?   All these processes are equally undesirable.   The reasonable and straight-forward method is an informal arbitration.   To refuse it is a denial of justice.I understand that the Secretary of State for India feels that if the arbitration-went against the views of the India Office, the Council of India would refuse to accept it, or the Indian Parliament might refuse to recognise it. It is always possible that a party to an arbitration will repudiate the award. But that is always thought to be a bad thing to do, and, moreover, a bad thing which it does not pay to do. If India is aspiring to full Dominion status it would be well that they should learn as soon as possible the right way of dealing with matters disputed between[15789]Printed for the Cabinet.

large communities or interests, and also that the principle of arbitration should be impressed upon their minds as a substitute for violence or fraud.I therefore ask the Cabinet to decide that the outstanding issues shall be settled by arbitration as far as British Departments are concerned. But I do not suggest that any measure of compulsion should be applied to the Indian Parliament if they repudiate the result of the award, assuming that it is unfavourable to them.W. S. C.March 2, 1927.The Secretaries of State for War and India in a joint memorandum CP. 69 (27) have submitted for the sanction of the Cabinet a settlement at which they have arrived in respect of certain financial questions arising out of the war which have been at issue between the War Office, the India Office and the Ministry of Pensions. The Cabinet will observe that the net result of the settlement is that not only are all the disputed claims in Lists A and B to be set off against one another and cancelled out, but that the War Office abandons to India an undisputed claim on Indian funds valued at  3,462,000 (List C). The Secretary of State for War has undoubtedly done all that he could to obtain a fair settlement, of these difficult and complicated matters, but his hands have throughout been tied by the absolute refusal of India to allow any of the questions in dispute to go to arbitration. There can be no doubt that from the point of view of the British Exchequer the settlement as presented is an unfavourable one, and strong objection can be taken to the terms of the settle-ment itself and to the attitude adopted by India during the whole course of these long-drawn-out negotiations extending over several years.India&apos;s attitude raises an important constitutional problem in connection with the discussion on Inter-Imperial relations at the recent Imperial Conference, viz., what is to happen in a dispute between two of the partner Governments of Empire which has been proved to be insoluble by the ordinary methods of negotiations if one of the disputants declines to arbitrate upon it ? In such an event the less intransi-gent partner is driven to make &quot;the best bargain possible,&quot; which in practice invariably means a losing bargain, for which the only justification is that it brings the dispute to an end. But no one can pretend that such a solution, with the possi-bilities of irritation, ill-will and even bitterness which it engenders, is a satisfactory one. To the suggestion of arbitration India has always opposed the claim that she is an independent financial authority which cannot be coerced into making a payment against her will (and further that it would require a resolution of Parliament under the Government of India Act to authorise her to make payment in respect of avar charges outside India). India&apos;s financial independence is, of course, not at issue, nor indeed is there any question of asking India to make any payment except such as can be shown to be due from her, but it is impossible to maintain that agreement to arbitrate in a dispute is incompatible Avith the possession of sovereignty.The position is in some degree complicated by the fact that India made a voluntary contribution to the cost of the Avar.India&apos;s original contribution was an undertaking to bear the normal charges in respect of Indian troops employed out of India, excess costs being borne by the Home Exchequer. The limit of the number of troops to Avhich this contribution applied was 160,000.In 1917 the Indian legislative council voted a cash contribution of  100 millions.This was paid as to  35 millions by money raised at the time, and, as to the balance, India accepted liability to pay interest charges on an equivalent amount of 5 per cent. War Loan.In 1918 a furthei contribution was announced, which is dealt with more in detail later in this memorandum.No one would wish to appear to reflect in any degree on the liberality of lndia&apos;s free-will gift. At the same time India is not entitled by the fact of such contribu-tions to claim to be absolved from payments which would otherwise have fallen on Indian funds. To make such a claim avould be to convert an unconditional into a conditional gift.The following figures of India&apos;s debt at the 31st March, 1926, may be of interest in this connection :

Millions.Eupeedebt          ...         ...         ... 511-27 383-4Sterling debt       ...          ...          ... 456-64 344-5Total debt    ......... 967-91 725-9Productive          ...          ... 742-10 556-6Unproductive       ...          .&quot;..... 225-81 169-3/ 967-91 725-9The debt per head of population of British India (247 millions) is  2 18s. 8d. The debt in-1913 was  307-4 millions (rupee at Is. 4d.). The increase since then appears to be mainly for reproductive debt. There is little, if any, war debt beyond the voluntary contribution to the British Exchequer. A sum of  18-3 millions remaining due on that contribution is included in the total debt given above. Presumably the  81-7 millions already paid may be regarded as having been raised by the creation of debt.Indian tax revenue (exclusive of Provinces) is about  55,000,000, or 4s. Qd. a head.On the merits of the various items included in the settlement, the War Office (not the Treasury) possesses all the material data, but it is clear that, in order to arrive at a settlement, the Secretary of State for War has had to give way on questions of principle in two, if not three, cases, to which brief reference must be made.(i.) The so-called  $$-million Claim.Under an agreement of 1870, the pension (whether service or casualty) of each regular officer or man of the British Army who has had Indian service has been divided between Indian and British funds in the proportion of the length of service in India and elsewhere respectively. This arrangement, which is convenient and appears entirely logical for pension is essentially part of the remuneration for service was in force from 1870 right through the Boer War up to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, although India had a short time prior to that date protested against its being applied to family pensions arising out of War Service. The large number of regular soldiers with Indian Service who fell in the Great War was made by India the occasion for pressing her protests. Had the terms of the 1870 agree-ment been applied in respect of all officers and men of the Regular Army with Indian service (i.e., not merely to those, serving at the outbreak of war, but to reservists and the retired men recalled to the Colours) the additional payment which India would have been called upon to make would have been some  3 millions a year falling year by year, and the capitalised value of this terminable annuity is estimated at  40 millions. Large as this sum appears at first sight, it must be remembered that the capital cost of British War pensions at the end of the war has never been estimated at less than  1,000 millions, and one estimate of the total capital valuation is  1,400 millions.India, however, while rejecting the claim entirely and refusing arbitration upon it, agrees to be debited with a sum (estimated at 5\ millions) for the accrued pension liability of British Regular Officers and Men with Indian service, of which she has been relieved by reason of their being killed or receiving war pensions instead of Service pensions, i.e., India abstains from making a profit.This is essentially a matter which should be referred to arbitration, involving as it does the repudiation by one of the parties of an agreement which has been in force for over 40 years.(ii.) India&apos;s further Contribution to the Cost of the War.India&apos;s further contribution to the cost of the War announced in September 1918 was to take the form that India would bear additional effective and non-effective charges in connection with her own troops raised for the purposes of the war, subject to certain provisos as to the length of the war and the financial, economic and political conditions of India herself. India had already paid  14^ millions provisionally on account of this offer in 1919/20, and, on her own interpretation of the offer and the conditions attaching thereto, claims that she has overpaid  7^ millions. The War Office, on the other hand, claimed that India&apos;s effective contribution alone on the
basis of her offer would amount to  14 - 4 millions, quite apart from the non-effective contribution. India agrees not to ask for any refund of the amount said to be over-paid provided a satisfactory agreement is reached on the  40 million claim and other claims.(iii.) The Meshed Expedition.This expedition was undertaken more for the benefit of India than for any part of the British Empire, and it was carried out by India. Its real object, it was always understood, was to prevent the penetration of enemy or Bolshevik influence into East Persia and thence into India, and there is every justification for asking India to contribute half the cost.
