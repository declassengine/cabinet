j This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!---^248Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1927.SECRET. Copy No.     30O.P. 92 (27).CABINET.PROPOSAL FOR A ROYAL COMMISSION ON MUSEUMS and galleries.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I CIRCULATE herewith a Memorandum prepared by the Treasury proposing the appointment of a Royal Commission on Museums and Galleries.W. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1, March 16, 1927.Proposal for a Royal Commission on Museums and Galleries.During the past two or three years the Treasury has been confronted with urgent requests for large capital expenditure on the rebuilding or extension of various Museums and Galleries : for example, on a complete new building for the Geological Museum, on an elaborate reconstruction of the British Museum, and on enlargements of the National Portrait Gallery and the Natural History Museum. Each one of these demands is supported by arguments, the merits of which it is not easy to refute ; but they have all been refused hitherto on the ground of financial stringency. It will, however, be difficult for the Treasury to maintain this attitude year after year, unless it can offer, as an alternative to a programme of piecemeal reconstruction, some well-thought-out scheme of reorganisation based on a comprehensive review of the existing conditions of all the various national collections.That such a review is necessary is becoming increasingly plain. It is a natural result of the historical origins of these collections that they have grown up haphazard, that there has never been any concerted plan for their development, and that an inevitable measure of overlapping- has arisen. Equally serious is the congestion of space in the Museums. In the case of the British Museum the position is becoming increasingly acute : the Trustees recently represented, in a deputation to the Prime Minister, that the continual accessions to their collections had produced a position of embarrassment, which in a few months wo aid be one of confusion, and in a year or two of chaos. It is quite possible that improvement in these respects could be obtained, for example, by some regrouping of Museums and Galleries on a more definite principle of classification. No doubt, any review undertaken with such ends in view would not necessarily bring much relief to ihe Exchequer ; but the Treasury would at least be able to satisfy itself, after the enquiry, that development was proceeding on an ordered plan, and it might well be that a co-ordinated programme of development would be less expensive than continued piecemeal expenditure such as that with which we are faced at the present moment.For these reasons, the approval of the Cabinet is sought to the appointment of a Royal Commission to review the whole&apos; system of the management of Museums and Galleries supported by the State. It is suggested that it might be left to the Treasury to settle the Commission^ terms of reference, which would require to he wide enough to secure a really comprehensive survey of the situation.[15910]
