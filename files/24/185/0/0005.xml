is this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.SECRET . COPY NO.    vC .P. 56 (27) .CABINET,SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES PROCEDURE.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,I circulate   for the information of my colleagues a record of a deputation which I received from the National Union of Manufacturers on the subject  of Safeguarding of Industries Procedure, I think the Cabinet ought to have the opportunity of seeing the criticisms made by the deputation, and the views which I expressed to the deputation.     I can shortly summarise the criticisms and my replies,1.     The first criticism was that the test of abnormal imports was much too rigid.     The deputation argued that provided an industry could show that there were substantial imports, and that if those Imports were reduced the industry could employ more men, a case for safeguarding had been established.     I replied that whatever the merits of this proposal might be it was a claim for protection pure and simple, and that any industry where imports were substantial (In fact almost any industry you can think of) would be entitled to claim a duty.2,     The deputation urged that inquiries should not take place in public^     The principal argument in favour of this was that the publicity of an inquiry put importers on their guard, and encouraged importations in advance of a duty.     My answer to that was that it was not the publicity as against the privacy of an inquiry which gave notice to importers, but the fact that an inquiry was   being held.     Any evidence which was confidential, or which, if disclosed
could   -prejudice the applicants, was already heard in camera. No benefit of the kind suggested by the deputation would be obtained from making the whole inquiry secret, whereas the applicants and the Government would alike incur the charge that an inquiry which it was promised should be fair and Impartial was turned, without just reason, into a hole and corner inquiry,3,       The deputation asked (though on this they were not unanimous) that the evidence of opponents should be more limited than it is at the present time.     My answer was that this was impossible.     Opponents must be entitled to call evidence of facts in reply to the applicants claim, e,g, as to hours and wages in foreign countries.     It would be unfair to exclude such evidence; any impartial court would ask for it; and if the case for a duty in the House is to be based on the inquiry of a committee, it would be fatal to allow the opposition to say that material evidence had been rejected.4,     A suggestion was made that duties should be imposed rapidly after a preliminary inquiry, and that a commission should be set up vtiich would have power to vary duties or exempt articles from their incidence.     This seemed to me to be an Impossible claim.     If we are to justify a duty to the House we must justify it by full examination in sdvance, and by having thought out all the repercussions.     I cannot imagine any Minister piloting a duty and asking the House to try it as an experiment, admitting that its consequences have not been fully weighed, and that it might want considerable variation later,     He would surely be told by his own side,  as well as by the opposition, to take away his proposals, to prepare them properly, and to present them to the House again.Moreover, there is the further objection that such a course
would be quite unconstitutional.     Parliament would be very unwilling to give an outside authority the power to vary duties, and I should be sorry to propose this .vvhen faced with these objections, I do not think the deputation were inclined seriously to press the proposal, which had not been fully thought out.5.     The most difficult question raised by the deputation was that of small industries.     The deputation argued that the Prime Minister had never excluded small Industries in his pledges and that on the positive side we were pledged to protect any industry if the competition was unfair *     My answer to this was that the Cabinet had carefully considered the White Paper, and had approved it as the most practical way of giving effect to our policy.     The size of an Industry must be a relevant consideration in deciding whether there was an exceptional case which would give rise to serious unemployment.     .7e had carefully avoided defining with precision what a substantial Industry was. There must obviously be border line cases; and in such cases I had in the preliminary inquiry always given an industry the benefit of the doubt.     We had also included industries, which though small, were of substantial importance by reason of the nature of their product, though I could not accept the claim advanced by one speaker that any industry was of substantial importance because a number of people used its products.   We had moreover agreed that where several small industries could reasonably be classed as one by reason of the nature of their products, or by reason of the fact that the same factories and the same workmen might be employed In one or another, these Industries could be grouped as a single unit for the purpose of an inquiry.
The deputation contended that the white Paper had no statutory authority,   and that therefore the Government was free to vary it as they wished a     I replied that while the White Paper had no statutory authority it had been produced by the Government as their considered view of the method by which their policy should be carried out; that this method had been in force for more than two years, and that the Government would have to justify fully any departure from the White Paper.My own view is that the White Paper procedure is far from perfect.     I should be sorry to see the Government committed to this procedure in another Parliament.     I think that it would be much more convenient and effective if we were free to impose duties on the sole responsibility of the Government on a limited number of industries which the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade would select, on the ground that duties would raise revenue,  substantially increase employment, and not raise undue difficulties by possible injury to other using industries,     I am bound to add that even if we felt ourselves free to pursue this   policy, I do not think either the Chancellor or I would select the majority of the small industries which are complaining to-day, If we are to have a controversy, let us have it over something which is worth while,  and which shows big results.   The immediate question, however, is whether we should vary the White Paper Unless we can vary it in the way I have just mentioned, which is In fact discarding it&apos;altogether, I think we should do more harm than good by tinkering with it, and that we should be well advised to adhere to the procedure to which the Government is formally committed,  aid which has been in force for more than two years.P. C-L.Board of Trade,16th Pebr uary, 1927.

Captain Ian Fraser introduced the Deputation.   He stated that their aim was to secure a wider interpretation than had resulted from the white Paper procedure, of the Prime Minister&apos;s pledge &quot;to safeguard the employment and standard of living of our people in any efficient industry in which they are &apos; imperilled by unfair foreign competition by applying the principle of the safeguarding of Industries Act or by analogous measures&quot;.   The requirements and methods of the present proc3dure had caused a great deal of inconvenience, difficulty and disappointment.Mr. P.J. Hannon called attention especially to the position of small industries, and asked for a more generous interpretation of the rules in this respect.   The fact that only six out of the forty-one industries which had made application had obtained safeguarding duties had given the impression, especially to small Industries, that under the present requirements it was hopeless to try to obtain a duty. It was widely felt that the number of people who had had an opportunity of increased employment through the procedure was less than vhat the country had expected from the Government.Mr. Hannon further referred to the position and influence of importers in safeguarding enquiries.   While British industries did not object to a fair and reasonable examination of their claims to safeguarding he thought that the representatives of importers were permitted to carry cross-examination further than was consonant with a reasonable amount of sympathy with British manufacturers on the part of the Government.Mr * H*D. Jackson pointed out that the Prime Minister&apos;s , pledge contains no specific mention of the requirements of the White Paper relating to substantial importance.   They had been a handicap to small trades which, at any rate, in the
aggregate employ a great number of people. Small trades could often, he thought, as much as double their employment with safe-guarding, while without it their position was worse than that of larger trades which   could obtain the advantages of large scale production. He referred specifically to the brace fittings industry. The decision that smaller industries might combine for the purposes of an application was an advance, but he thought the test should be not one of size at all but of the proportion of the home market which was,  at present, supplied by imports and which might, therefore, be supplied by British-made goods and give employment here.Mr. yuR?Niche1son referred to the Glauses of the White Paper relating to ,!exceptional competition&quot; and employment. It was often, he maintained, very difficult to prove exceptional competition, as, for example, in the case of a new industry.and he thought the test should be based not on a comparison with the   past, but upon the present ratio of imports to consumption. If, however, the comparison with the past was retained, the year 1913 was now out of date*    Further, he thought it should not be necessary to prove unemployment as well as competition: if goods were imported which co-aid be manufactured here employment must obviously be affected,Mr. A.W,,Foster spoke as a representative of the Paper Makers, whom he described as reaping the benefits of safeguarding. From his experience before a Committee he could say that the vagueness of the term &quot;abnormal&quot; caused a great deal of difficulty.The President here pointed out that to fix a definite percentage would be to tie the hands of the Government and necessarily exclude hard cases which might be only just below the line.
Mr. A.fl Foster continuing said it should not be necessary to prove exceptional importation.    The whole home paper market might, for example, be upset by even an importation of 100 tons and he would advocate safe-guarding in any such case.    It should also, he thought, not be necessary to prove unemployment since under this provision safeguarding could not be extended to an entirely new industry or to an industry which was capable &quot;of expansion only under safeguarding.   Further, in many cases employers keep on their workpeople in spite of bad trade and are, therefore, unable to produce severe unemployment figures for safeguarding Committees.Mr. F.P. Dorizzi raised the question of the admission of evidence of foreign manufacturers.   He thought foreign manufacturers had too much Influence and too many privileges in these inquiries and read extracts from letters from German manufacturers who had supported the opposition to the Enamelled Hollow-ware Industry.    He maintained that importers are obliged to oppose applications under threat of having their foreign supplies cut    off.   Further, he thought the President ought to give some ruling as to the type of evidence to be accepted at these inquiries.    Foreign affidavits had even been accepted as evidence by the Hosiery Committee.Mr. A.N. Gray spoke on behalf of the superphosphate industry in the absence of Mr. Menzies, who was unable to be present owing to the change of date of the Deputation.    The superphosphate Industry had been turned down by a majority report of the Committee, the Chairman being in favour of a duty.    The present condition of the industry amply justified the Chairman&apos;s finding and he thought the time had come when the case of this and other industries in the same position should be
reconsidered.Mr. Gray further thought that ,Committee made .-. -       &apos;unreasonable demands upon British manufacturers for evidence regarding conditions in foreign countries.MR. A.-E* Bowyer-Lowe said his industry (Radio. Apparatus) had prepared a case under the White Paper, but on exchanging views with other Associations had come to the conclusion that it was hopeless to make out a case under the present procedure and had never presented it. They wei-e suffering from severe competition and dumping from the United States of America.    They also had to face continental competition,MTo E.A. Hailv/ood put forward the case of the glass industry.    The industry should be considered of substantial importance,  since many of its products were of great importance during the war.   His firm had then undertaken the production of miners&apos; lamp glasses (and had added illuminating ware since the factory could not be run economically if limited to the former articles) under a Government promise of three years&apos; protection against foreign competition after the war.    This promise was not fulfilled. The case of the industry for safeguarding had failed because they could not show abnormal importation compared with 1913, but 1913 had been a year of very acute foreign competition. The inaustry was suffering very severely and if it could not come within the provisions of the White Paper, that showed that there was something wrong with the procedure.Mr. A.W. Dunn spoke on behalf of the surgicalinstrument manufacturers.    This industry had failed toget consideration under the old Act owing to delays,  andan application under the present procedure had been madein September 19S5 and finally rejected in June 1936 onthe ground that the industry was not of substantialimportance and that import a -7 ere not abnormal.    He-7-
maintained that the industry was of national importance especially in war time on account of the nature of the goods produced and that a very great portion of the trade was now held by German importers sometimes trading under English names.Sir F. Mills from his experience as Chairman of the Gas Mantles Committee under the White Paper drew attention to the difficulties of Committees in interpreting their instructions. He had no objection to evidence being heard from foreign manufacturers, but he thought Committees should only have to enquire into definite facts.    With regard to substantial importance, he thought that industries should not need any qualification to be heard.    He was of opinion that it paid to manufacture here anything that could be manufactured and was himself in favour of a duty in any such case.Major E. Johnson representing the iron and steel wire manufacturers, said this industry was suffering from very severe competition before the war and had expanded during the war but had since lost ground again, though output was probably not lower than in 1913.    Their application &quot;had been rejected as a part of the general iron and steel industry and they had been unable to get separate consideration.   The position of the industry was still worse since the strike.Mr. W. Harrison referring to the effect of the wrapping paper duty, said that, mills now had full order books and seven or eight weeks1 work, instead of only a week&apos;s work at the most* while British prices were no higher than before the duty, the increased market having decx^eased British cost of production His own companies, though not much interested in wrapping papers had purchased since the duty three large wrapping paper machines Conditions in Germany, he maintained, were very inferior to those in this country.
Mr. Harrison also referred to the manufacture of vegetable parchment, at present a foreign monopoly, which he was about to start in this country.     He would be subjected to the full blast of foreign competition, but he understood that he would be unable to obtain assistance under the safeguarding procedure owing to the fact that the industry was a new one.Mr. George Terrell   summed up for the Deputation.     The provisions of the White Paper went, they felf, outside the Prime Minister&apos;s pledge and they were here to ask the Presid nt to modify the Paper, in order both to make its requirements less stringent and the procedure less expensive and to prevent that dumping of imports in anticipation of a duty which was so disorganising to business.     The qualification with regard to substantifl importance also needed modification: some industries, it appeared, were too large and others too small.The plan he vjiahed to put forward was one prepared and submitted to the Board of Trad-j two years ago.     The Board of Trade or some independent person or committee should hold a preliminary enquiry in secret and if they decided favourably, Parliament should be asked to impose a duty forthwith, thus preventing any flood of imports.     An independent Commission should be set up to review such duties and relax or remit them where it appeared necessary.In conclusion Mr. Terrell drew attention to the figures of 41 applications received and only 6 duties granted. Manufacturers felt that this was a sure indication that the White Paper had not fulfilled the affirmative side of the government&apos;s pledge and was in need of revision.   They asked the President  in amending it to make It simple, speedy .,and-inexpensive.The President tbanteed the Deputation for putting
their points with such clearness and conciseness. He proposed to deal in turn with all the points which had been raised.He understood them to criticise the procedure as being too narrow and not extending the benefits of safeguarding so widely as had been expected from the Prime minister  pledge. A3 the administrator of the safeguarding policy, he was subject to attack from ona aide for interpreting the pledge too narrowly and from the other side for interpreting it too widely. The procedure laid down in the White Paper had been adopted by the Government after very careful consideration first by a Cabinet Committee and then by the Cabinet and had been presented to parliament as embodying the Government^ considered interpre-tation of the Prime Minister fs safeguarding policy as outlined during the Election.   The White Paper had, of course, no statutory authority, but the Government would feel themselves obliged to justify up to the hilt in Parliament any modification in it.    In some respects the wording of the White Paper had designedly been left vague in order that the Government should not be bound by a hard and fast rule which might operate inequitably in particular instances.The second point which had been raised related to the position of small industries. This clause had been specially considered and included by the Cabinet, who took the view that they were dealing with exceptional cases where employment was substantially involved, and therefore designedly laid down this clause to exclude industries whera employment was not sufficiently large to admit of special treatment.. Industries had been advised that they were at liberty to make joint applications where two or more trades could reasonably be said to be part of the same industry.He could assure the deputations that he had never weighted the scales against the manufacturers - the fact that
a number of applications which he had sent to Committees had been rejected by the latter proved rather the reverse - and the Department were always ready to explain to any industry the figures and facts upon which the case was rejected. He was bound to follow the instructions laid down and he would not grant enquiries which he knew any Committee must reject.One or two speakers had raised a point as to the position of importers under the procedure.    As he understood it, complaint was made on two points: while no objection was taken to a reasonable amount of cross-examination of applicant witnesses, it was felt that such examination went too far;  and secondly,  it was felt that evidence from foreign manufacturers ought to be excluded.The first of these criticisms was withdrawn by the Deputation.On the second point the President pointed out that while he had always refused to allow foreign manufacturers to be parties in these inquiries, he could not justify the exclusion of their evidence on, for example, conditions abroad, when that evidence was tendered in reply to the allegations of applicants; the actual wages and labour conditions being questions of fact.Mr. Hannon asked whether such evidence could not be given,  if necessary in camera, from Board of Trade official sources.The President said this was impossible.    The duties of Commercial Attaches were very wide and he could not allow them to do things for particular trades which might prejudice them in the performance of their other duties. Even if the information were given in camera,  its origin would undoubtedly become known and then the sources
of information formerly open to Commercial Atjtache-b- would,- -&quot;be closed.The Deputation   were not agreed upon the question of the evidence of foreign manufacturers.    Mr. Harrison amongst others being in favour of such evidence being admitted provided it was then subject to cross-examination, but it was felt that, when applicants were subjected to full cross-examination, evidence for the opposition merely in the form of Affidavits should not be admitted.The President said that he thought the admission and weighing of evidence should be left to Committees. He took note, however, of their complaint with regard to the Hosiery Committee and would make enquiries.With regard to the glass industry, his recollection was that there had been a failure to establish a prima facie case whether a comparison was made with a pre-war year or with a post-war year, but if conditions had changed since a case was presented, it was, of course, always open to an industry to make a new application.    The fact3 and figures had been fully discussed with the industry.    The wire industry, had been specially considered by the Cabinet, and it had been held that the wire industry could not be separated from the main iron and steel industry in this connection.   He pointed out that the iron and steel application was not turned down because it was too large, but because the Government had come to a conclusion that a duty on iron and steel would have entailed putting a duty upon so wide a range of finished-products as to infringe the pledge against general protection. Asked whether this decision applied to all finished products made of iron and steel, the President said he would prefer not to answer that question generally but thought the particular
cases would have to he considered.It had been suggested that the enquiry prior to the imposition of a safeguarding duty should be held by the Board of Trade or an Independent Committee in secret and that a Commission acting independently of Parliament should be set up to review, relax and remit duties after their imposition, that is, in effect to carry out the detailed examination of claims to duties, and the possible reaction of any duties, which at present was gone through before the imposition of a duty.    In the first place, he thought that there would be no justification for having the enquiry secret, and that such a procedure would certainly be open to severe criticism.    It would not prevent a flood of imports, since the enquiry would presumably have to be announed even if it were conducted in secret.    In the second place, it would be, difficult to justify a duty in Parliament unless the facts had l;een fully enquired into first.    Parliament would scarcely be satisfied with the fact that the pros and cons of the duty were to be enquired into by an independent Commission to be set up after its imposition.   Finally, he felt sure Parliament would never   ive to an outside body the power to vary or remit duties.In conclusion the President pointed out that the deputation were in effect asking that any industry whatever the  amount of employment it gave should have a right to a hearing, and that to make out a case it should be sufficient to show considerable competition from foreign imports.    This would be protection and not safeguarding.   He feared that the Cabinet could not change the interpretation which after full consideration had for two years been placed upon the Prime Ministers pledge and that the V/hite Paper must stand.   He promised, however,  to report to the Prime Minister.

He promised, however, to report to the Prime &quot;Inister.
Captain fraser asked whether the position of the small industries would at any rate he reconsidered, since that was not a matter of interpretation of the pledge.The President pointed out that the Cabinet had not considered that the admission of large numbers of small industries was compatible with what they conceived to be a policy dealing with special cases of industries in which a substantial amount of employment was involved.   He promised, however, that he would mention this point particularly in reporting to the Pi-ime Minister.Mr. Gould asked what goods were intended to be covered by the requirement that the nature of the goods might be such as to make an industry of substantial importance.    The President instanced the case of Gas Mantles and said it would certainly not be sufficient that an article was used by a large number of people.Mr. A.E. Jacob thanked the President for the attention and time which he had given to the reception of the Deputation.The Meeting then ended.
