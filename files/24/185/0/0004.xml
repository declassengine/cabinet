[This Document is the.Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1927.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 55 (27).ACCOUNT OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  FOREIGN AFFAIRS  AND M.  ROSENGOLZ.THE   Secretary of State received M. Rosengolz (with M. Bogomoloff as interpreter) by request this afternoon.- M. Rosengolz began by saying that he thought that something ought to be done to improve relations between Great Britain and Russia in the interests of trade between the two countries. The Secretary of State at once replied that M. Rosengolz should address himself to Moscow rather than here. The improvement of relations lay entirely in the hands of the Soviet Government. It depended on the cessation of the hostile propaganda which was directed by Soviet agents all over the world against this country.M. Rosengolz thereupon said that the recent intervieav given by M. Litvinoff to the press was evidence of the desire of the Soviet Government for better relations, and yet there had been no response on this side. Moreover, Russian public opinion was convinced that Great Britain was working everywhere against Russia and inciting the neighbouring States against her. Sir Austen replied that this was not surprising in view of the public utterances of the Soviet leaders and the articles in the official press, which were full of misstatements about the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. There was not a word of truth in the allegation that His Majesty&apos;s Government were engaged in any activities against Russia or in an attempt to bring about a combination of States against her. The form of Government which she chose to adopt was her affair; what we would not tolerate was her attempt to impose revolutionary ideas on other countries.To this M. Rosengolz retorted by a reference to the speeches of certain British Ministers which were unfriendly to the Soviet Government, but Sir Austen pointed out that there was no parallel.Proceeding, Sir Austen said that M. Litvinoff had made no communication to him and he reminded M. Rosengolz that he had told M. Rakovsky and M. Krassin that, if the Soviet Government had any serious proposals to make, he would be ready -to listen. He must, however, repeat that, this must be dependent on their giving real assurances that there would be a complete cessation of propaganda, and that the evidence must be in deeds rather than words. Moreover he had always maintained that it was not the slightest use their putting up a proposal for fresh negotiations, unless there was a reasonable chance of their being successful. The failure of renewed negotiations would simply leave the situation, worse than if they had not been started. As a general indication of what was required, he had told M. Krassin that there could be no question of a Government loan and that there must be a recognition of the obligations of the Russian Government to the British Government and British nationals.M. Rosengolz said that for His Majesty&apos;s Government to impose conditions on any Russian proposal was to prejudice it at the start. He then enquired at some length the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards a loan. Sir Austen explained that, in the first place, the British Government had long since ceased to make or guarantee loans to foreign countries, and, in the second place, in the present bad condition of political relations between Great Britain and Russia, he would certainly not encourage the City to negotiate a loan with the Soviet Government. Nor did he think that, so long as the Soviet Government continued to repudiate their obligations, there was the least chance that the City would entertain a new loan.The conversation then reverted to the propaganda issue, M. Rosengolz insisting that the cessation of hostile activities must be mutual. Sir Austen once again pointed out the absurdity of the Soviet Government&apos;s charges against His Majesty&apos;s3843   [15778]
Government, and, as an illustration of their baselessness, referred to two occasions on which M. Chicherih himself Had made complete mis-statements to Dr. Stresemann when they met in Berlin. The first was an allegation that a memorandum had been prepared in the Foreign Office aiming at the formation of a combination of States in an anti-Russian block : this memorandum had never existed. The second was an allegation that His Majesty&apos;s Government were promoting a scheme for the exchange of the Polish Corridor and Danzig against Lithuania and Memel there was not a word of truth in this either.On the other hand, Sir x^.usten continued, the evidence of the hostile attitude of Soviet Russia towards this country and Empire, whether on the part of the leaders of opinion in Russia or of the official press or of Soviet agents all over the world, was indisputable. A dangerous situation had been created in consequence. His Majesty&apos;s Government had exercised the utmost patience, but relations had become seriously strained. If His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to maintain them nevertheless, it was because they had thought fit to do so, and not for want of provocation or lack of justification for breaking them off. The Soviet Government professed to desire an improvement. If so, they were at liberty to make a proposal, and they could be sure that it Avould be listened to. But, Sir Austen concluded, he must insist again that it was no use their putting forward a proposal unless it was serious and had a reasonable chance of success.- M. Rosengolz said that he was grateful for the explanations he had been given and would transmit them to his Government. In conclusion, he referred to China and attempted a statement to the effect that there was a misunderstanding regarding Russian policy towards that country, but the Secretary of State made it clear at once to him that it was useless to pursue an argument on these lines.Foreign Office, February 14, 1927.
