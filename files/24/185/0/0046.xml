At their Meeting on 15th March 1927 (Cabinet 16 (27))the Cabinet in effect agreed that the draft of the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Bill annexed to the Committeers Fourth Report (CP.32(27 )) should be reprinted so as to include the clauses dealing with illegal strikes, protection of persons refusing to take part in such strikes, prevention of intimidation and the political levy, and also (in square brackets) the amendments proposed by the Minister of Health in CcPa 82(27 ) and the provisions regarding oivil servants and employees of local authorities.2. The draft Bill revised in accordance with the Oabinefsdirections is attached hereto-     Alterations made since the Bill was before the Cabinet on the 15th March are underlined in black.3. The Committee have examined the proposals of theMinister of Health set out  in Clause 1(2) of the attached Bill, and having failed to reach agreement as to the desirability of including the proposals in the Bill reserve this question for the determination ol the Cabinet.4. The members of the Committee who favour the retentionof Clause 1(2) in the Bill represent that public opinion will
welcome any proposals which will lessen the risk of strikes or lockouts in essential industries, that the object of the Bill will not be attained merely by prohibiting general strikes unless action is  also taken against industrial st rikes, that it will probably be found that in practice the proposals will work more satisfactor-ily than is feared by those who now oppose them,  and that in any ease some such plan as is now suggested should be given a fair trial.-.5* The Minister of labour and certain other membersof the Committee are, however, convinced that the proposals in question will not only fail to attain the object in view, but must very preju.dioie.lly affect the existing elaborate and on the whole successful system of conciliation machinery.      The principal objections to proposals on the lines of those now in question are set out in the Minister of Labourrs Memorandum (C.P0  101(27)) which is circulated herewith *6. Apart from Clause 1(2) it will be necessary forthe Cabinet to determine whether the special provisions in Clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill applicable to Civil Servants and to persons employed by Local Authorities should be retained in the Bill or should form the subject matter of separate legislation.Signed or behalf of the CommitteeBIHICSIfHEAjD.
