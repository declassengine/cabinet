%MATIC RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT.Memorandum for the Cabinet.IN the discussion on our relations with the Soviet Government I spoke of the effect on Germany of a breach of diplomatic relations between Great Britain and Russia. In the course of the discussion it was suggested that my apprehensions were unfounded or at least exaggerated.To-day I have received a despatch from Sir R. Lindsay dated the lGth instant. He reports a conversation with the Secretary of State mainly concerned with the relations between Germany and Poland, but it contains the following paragraph on Anglo-Russian relations : &quot; 6. Lastly we came to Russia. Herr von Schubert said that he was conscious of the existence of considerable tension between the Soviet and His Majesty&apos;s Government. It was a, matter which caused the gravest anxiety in Germany, who would be placed in a position of the gravest peril if anything like a breach were to occur between London and Moscow. He could not help feeling nervous about the situation. His own experience was that the best way to draw the poison out of relations with Russia was to deal with Russia, but at the same time he realised that China was a critical point in Anglo-Russian relations and about China he knew almost nothing; he also admitted that the Russians were obsessed by a fear of being encircled; and that it was absolutely impossible even to talk to them about world revolution. I said that it was undeniable that the U.S.S.R. by their manoeuvres in China and in Great Britain itself had brought about a serious tension in Anglo-Russian relations, but I had no reason to suppose that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment desired to push matters to the extremity of an open breach.&quot;At the time of the Cabinet discussion I could adduce nothing but my own appreciation of the position. The Cabinet will now see that that appreciation is confirmed by Herr von Schubert&apos;s words.A. C.Foreign Office,February 19, 1027[15809]Printed for the Cabinet.
NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.IN my note, CP. 28 (27), on Some Tendencies of Trade Union Opinion, circulated on the 28th January, I drew attention to the proposal, which has recently been revived by Mr. A. Henderson, for the calling of a National Industrial Conference. I now circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a note dealing historically and critically with this question. It is one towards which the Government may be asked to define its attitude at an early date.A. S.-M.Ministry of Labour,February 28, 1927.I581 2 a
