The Committee, which was appointed by the Cabinet on February 23rd,   (Cabinet 13(27) Conclusion 4)  &quot;to consider the question of the International Regulation of Hours of Work&quot;, has hold two meetings.^The Committee recommend that a Bill should be drafted dealing with the question of Hours of Employment in Industrial Undertakings In Great Britain.      The provisions of the Bill should follow in the main the existing industrial conditions in this country and should be calculated to- interfere as little as possible with those conditions?The Committee also recommend that this Bill should be . submitted confidentially to a number of leading Employers,, When the views of these Employers have been ascertained, a further report should be made to tho Cabinet,-With regard to the position In the Goal Mines, it was very much pressed on the Committee by the President of the Board of Trade that some provision should be Inserted to prevent any interference with the operation of the Coal Mines Act,  1926. The majority of the Committee thought It would probably be necessary to do this, but it is questionable whether any such provision should be inserted In the Draft Bill until the views of the mineowners have been ascertained.(Signed on behalf of the Committee) CEC IL,Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens,  S-.W.1. .8th March, 1927.COPY NO,THIS DpOUJgSNT IS THS PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERN/SNT).S EJ3 R .E ,To GaP^  77  (27).--------- g a B I HE ToCOMMITTEE, OR WASHINGTON HOURS C ONVENTION * First Interira reports
