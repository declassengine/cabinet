ROYAL COMMISSION ON,CROSS-RIVER TRAFFIC IN LONDON.L    That which deals with the Central London area from London Bridge to Westminster, -2.    Further proposals outside this area.1.    The works suggested by the Commission in the Central London area and their estimated cost are:-(a) A proposed new &quot;Ludgate&quot; Bridge immediately down stream from the existing Blackfriars Railway Bridge. Cost 3 millions,(b) Waterloo Bridge   Proposal to pull down four arches and re-build, widening it to a 35 ft-  roadway by corbelling out the top.    Cost  360,000*(c) A^proposed new double.....bridge,  carrying a road over theIQ&apos;lJ-iZSZjL- down stream from &quot;the/existing railway:/ bridge with a new&apos;&apos; Chajrljig^Cross Station on and to&quot; the lLast of Villiers Street. Cost 7-k millions.&quot;The Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic in London was appointed on the 24th July, 1926, and reported on November 30th. They prepared in the very short time at their disposal a comprehensive report dealing with the river crossings from Gravesenc to Hampton Court.      The report falls into three divisions:-(1) Recommendations in connection with river crossingsincluding the construction of ? new bridges, a new tunnel, three new important roads, and the reconstruction of 7 existing bridges at an estimated cost of  27,500,000.&apos;Si(2) A proposal for the creation of a central authority to deal with the whole problem of bridges and cross traffic facilities. within the London Traffic area.(3) A proposal to provide finance to  enable the centralauthority to arrange with the local authorities concerned for the execution of the works recommended on a basis of a contribution of ?:5fo of the cost by raising a loan estimated at  19,000,000 on the security of a statutory allocation of  1,000,000 a year from the Road Fund.The Commission have linked these three proposals together on the grounds that in putting forward a programme of bridge construction they were bound to indicate the administrative and financial provisions necessary in their opinion to carry it into effect.      It is suggested, however, that the proposals of the Commission may be considered separately-      The later recommendations raise questions of policy extending far beyond the limited though important problem of cross river traffic in London and other means may be more appropriate to secure the provisions in whole or in part of the river crossings advocated by the Commission.Ifees.&amp; The proposals of the Commission for facilities forllFriver cross river traffic fall into two parts :-Sings
To the aggregate cost  ( 25,000,000)  of the sixteen schemes recommended,   the Commission have added a sum of  2.500,000 representing an all-over provision of 10 per cent to cover contingencies. It is not possible without a fall and detailed examination of the various estimates to determine,  even -approximately, what proportion of this general allowance for contingencies would fall to be added to the estimated cost of the three major works mentioned above.These recommendations contain the findings of the Commission on the two bridges,  St. Paul&apos;s and Waterloo, particularly mentioned in their terms of references,  and unless the work of the Commission is to be lost the intentions of the Government with regard to these proposals must be conveyed to the London County Council and the City at an early date.In order to preserve Waterloo Bridge on the lines suggested, with a roadway restricted to 35 feet, a decision to provide other cross river facilities, at Charing Cross,  is required. Failing those other facilities the rebuilding of Waterloo Bridge without wider road and footways cannot be  justified.The proposal of the Commission is to deal with the problem of a Charing Cross Bridge by means of a double decked railway and road bridge. On the assumption that the transfer of Charing Cross Station to the South bank of the river is impracticable,   on which the Commission^s considered opinion must be taken as final,  no traffic authority would dispute that the Commission&apos;s proposal if practicable combines the maximum advantages since it removes the eyesore of the existing railway bridge,  gives a good road crossing and provides the Southern Railway with a new bridge,  an improved Charing Cross Station and a better approach to Waterloo. Owing however to lack of time the Commission could not have any detailed plans prepared and the erection of a. heavy stuel bridge at this point on the river raises engineering problems of considerable complexity.  Before a final decision can be reached,  plans must be prepared,  together with a closer estimate of the cost than has yet been possible. This wciv; will,  however, probably occupy a year and it is difficult,  if not Impossible,  to delay a decision on Waterloo Bridge for so long.Fortunately, however,  a decision in principle could be made without covering points on which the full facts are not yet available. The acceptance of the Commissions proposals for Waterloo Bridge carries with it the approval and promise of a crossing for road traffic at Charing Cross; if on further investigation, a double deck bridge proved to be impossible for engineering or financial reasons,  a result which is not suggested as probable but must be reoognised as possible the actual needs of the  traffic could be effectively met by a road bridge on the same line.An investigation by engineers representing the Ministry of Transport, the London County Council and the Southern Railway should be commenced as soon as possible.The proposal for a new Ludgate Bridge in the place of that at St. Paul&apos;s,  though not so closely linked with that for Waterloo Bridge as is the Charing Cross scheme,  is yet assooiated with it and with the future of London Bridge.
The Government will have to Indicate at  an early date their attitude to the proposal.      Fortunately, however, the City are in possession of the funds accumulated and property purchased for St. Paul&apos;s Bridge and it may be assumed that,  if Ludgate Bridge be proceeded with, the whole cost of such bridge and its immediate approaches would be borne by the Bridge House Estates Committee.      It  should be sufficient if the commitments of the Road Fund were limited to a contribution of 50 per cent of the cost of widening the further approach reads both north and south of the River, estimated at  1,000,000. (Note? the commitments of the Road Fund in connexion with the proposed St tPatil&apos;s Bridge amounted to approximately  867,000 based on a contribution of one-third of the estimated cost of widening the further approach roads to that bridge).     The City could then be invited in consultation with the London County Council as the improve-ments authority, to examine the proposed Ltidgate Bridge, the main difficulty of which is the management of the traffic which would be discharged into the Smithfield Market area.The cost of these proposals alone to the Road Fund 3is of the C made up as follovvss-on the basis of the Commission&apos;s estimates would be  6,770,000,Waterloo Bridge.  75;i of estimated cost. 645,000Charing Cross Bridge.75/&amp; of estimated cost.        5,625,000Ludgate Bridge .50^&quot; of estimated cost ofwidening further approachroads . _500,0006,770,000To the foregoing estimates,  some proportion of the provision of an overall 10$ to cover contingencies may require to be added.2.      In their recommendations outside this central area the Commission adopt  in general the proposals of the Ministry of Transport which have been endorsed by the London Traffic Advisory Committee with the important addition of two new bridges at Dorset Wharf and Chiswick included in the We stern exits scheme.      Some of these works,  such as the new Victoria Dock Road, the widening of Putney Bridge and the new Richmond Bridge,  are urgently necessary, and all of them represent traffic facilities which in some form or another must ultimately be provided but each can be executed separately as finance is available without the delay of one set of works prejudicing the ultimate completion of the programme  as a whole.Since the particular circumstances which attach to the problem of the central bridges are not present in these schemes the case for a contribution by the Road Fund of so high a percentage of the cost as an average of 75^ is less obvious and each particular work could be considered for grant on its merits,
?6t instance, the Count:/ Council has agreed to rebuild Lambeth  -ridge with a contribution of only 50,* from the Road fund, while the Victoria Dock Road, to the urgency of which the Commission draw special attention, will need a 75/* contribution as a minimum.It  is therefore suggested that the proposals in the Commissions report for other crossings outside the central area might be adopted  in general-with a reservation as to the amount of contribution from the Road Fund;(2) The proposal for the creation of a centralauthority to &quot;deal with the whole problem of bridges and   cross-river facilities within the -bondon Traffic area.Commissions, Committees and experts who have examined the London Traffic problem or any aspect of that problem have agreed that the main difficulty is the absence of one central executive authority,:     Ho proposal, however, for the creation of such an authority has yet been found politically practicable^     Previous Commissions have con-template! a central authority with power to finance and carry out any works which from time to time they considered, necessary. Power to finance is in the case of a local authority usuallyi assumed to oe power to levy a rates but a new precepting authority in the London area would add to the existing adminis-trative confusion and be extremely difficult to justify., while the elevation of the County Council or any other existing rating authority into a traffic authority would involve all those political difficultisrj which have hitherto proved an insuperable obstacle to the reform of London Government, on the lines of a single authority *      The present Commission have succeeded in avoiding the political difficulty of a new rating authority by suggesting a Bridge authority without rating powers and dependent solely on a grant from central funds. They have further sought to avoid unnecessary friction by depriving the proposed authority of any power actually to construct    bridges.      however great the admitted advantages of --% a single traffic authority or a single bridge authority with executive powers may be,  those advantages applj/ less clearly to the proposal for a single authority which has no power to levy a rate and no power to build a bridge *      The effect of the Commissions suggestion would be to set up as an independent statutory authority a body (the London Traffic Advisory Committee) consisting of representatives of the local authorities (in a majority) together with representatives of the Home Office, the Police and the Ministry of Transport  (in a minority)..    This body would elect its own Chairman and would be responsible not to Parliament but ultimately to the local authorities appointing the majority of the members.      The business of the body would be to induce statutory authorities responsible for the building of bridges to proceed as quickly as possible with the programme laid down in advance by the Commission and for this purpose they would be able to promise contributions from a capital sum of 19 millions available for this purpose and no other.
If the bridge building authorities desired contributions greater than 75^ or refused to build the bridges proposed by the Ooniaission and desired to build others,&apos; the new statutory authority could   do nothing except allow their statutory income of a million a year to accumulate.      It Is doubtful, therefore, whether this constitutional innovation of an independent local authority administering national funds would secure the more rapid construction of bridges by the statutory authorities than would the existing constitutional procedure, by which, with the sanction of the Treasury, the Minister of Transport may promise contributions to certain works from the Road Fund.      If the Government authorised the expenditure from the Road Fund of the requisite amount., the Minister of Transport working with and through the Advisory Committee on the present statutory basis could secure the execution of the bridge programme of the Commission as *rapidly and with, greater security to the public purse than  -could the separate authority.      These proposed new powers for the. Advisory Committee are a method of securing a statutory allocation of money to a particular purpose.      If the money is not available the new body is useless.      If, and in so far as money is available, the existing method of disbursement is quite effective, as practice has shown in connection with other large road programmes.The third proposal of the Commission is that a loan of 19 millions should be raised on the security of a statutory allocation of a million a year from the Road Fund. The existence of the Road Fund has hitherto avoided the necessity for Government borrowing to finance road works and the whole programme of arterial and other road works initiated in the years 1921 - 1925 totalling 50 millions with a Road Fund contribution of 54 has been financed without a loan, though the execution of the works has extended over several yea,rs.It is probably unnecessary to enter in detail into a discussion of the disadvantages of additional public borrowings at the present time but it is important to examine how far any presumed advantages of financing these expenditures out ofsloan can be met by an alternative arrangement.      What is aimed at, no doubt,  is some security that the schemes will in fa,ct be executed and not held up for want of money and it is further presumed that construction might proceed faster than finances will be available.Upon the second point experience has shown that the rate of expenditure upon the larger road and bridge works is invariably slower than general estimates framed at the inception of the programme.      Many of these important proposals will require a great deal of preparatory engineering work, and some of them will need statutory authority.In order to ensure that the schemes are in fact carried out there appears to be no reason why the Government should not adopt a procedure which is followed in other cases, and has been the basis of the Road Fund finance for some years past in connexion with the Unemployment Programmes.      The Minister of Transport with the approval of the Treasury can commit the Road Fund to contributions to further works, and if necessary, can pledge the Government to make contributions to the whole of the programme of the Commission or to such portions of it as may be accepted.
For physical reasons it would be obviously impossible for adjacent bridges to be under reconstruction at the same time, and it is thought that a period of IE years,  as suggested in the accompanying table, will be the minimum period in which completion could be secured in practice quite apart from financial considerations,On the basis that the whole of the works are carried out in 12 years and that the contributions from the Road Fund are on the level suggested by the Commission,  i.e. an average of 75 per cent of the estimated cost, an annual allocation of  1,587,000 would be necessary for a term of 12 successive years beginning with the 1st April, 1927,It is not considered necessary, however, that a contribution of more than 50 per cent should be made from the Road Fund in the case of a number of the schemes outside the Central Area as it is thought that the local authorities concerned would be prepared to proceed with such schemes on that basis.    The percentage contribution suggested in respect of each scheme is shown in the annexed teble and on this basis -and allowing for an inevitable lag in the carrying out of the various works,  it is considered that an annual allocation of  1,000,000 for 15 years commencing 1st April, &apos;1927, would be sufficient.An allocation of  400,000 a year towards the cost of schemes recommended by the London Traffic Committee has been already promised and as some of the Advisory Committee&apos;s schemes are included in the Commission&apos;s programme it would be possible to reduce this e-llocation by a sum of not less than  150,000 a year.      Furthermore,  in connection with the St. FaulTs Bridge scheme,  the commitments of the Road Fund, as already stated,  amounted to  867,000 and this sum may be regarded as a set-off to the suggested allocation of  1,000,000 a year to finance the Commission1s Programme.The Road Fund,  if its revenue is not diverted or depleted by any change in taxation, would be able to provide the suggested allocation of  1,000,000 a year towards the cost of the Commission^ programme without unduly depleting the amount available for other necessary purposes elsewhere on the present basis.      Contributions on this scale to London bridge and tunnel schemes including the cost of the acquisition of property, may result in increased demands from other great towns, but the circumstances of the Metropolis are exceptional as its transport facilities affect the whole country and the improvements comprised in the Commissions programme are necessary to the movement of a very large part of the trade and population of the whole country.The following decisions on the Report are suggested:-(1)  That the recommendations of the Commission as regards Waterloo, Charing Cross and Ludgate Bridges be accepted so far as the Government is concerned subject to detailed examination confirming the Commissions anticipations.(2)  That the recommendations as regards other bridges and tunnels be accepted subject to the. consideration of the Western Exits scheme by the authorities concerned and provided that the execution of the programme as a whole does not involve a contribution from the    Road Fund exceeding  1,000,000 per year for a period of 15 years beginning 1st April, 1927.
This allocation would be placed in a special Suspense Account but would not form a separate statutory fund.      The Suspense Account would be credited each year with the agreed sum and the expenditure as it accrued would be debited against the account,(3)  That no statutory alteration should be made in the position of the London Traffic Advisory Committee but that the Minister of Transport should consult with the Committee in the allocation of the money made available from the Road Fund for London bridges and tunnels.(4)  That while the allocation of  1,000,000 a year for a period of 15 years should be made to London bridges and the other works recommended by the Commission, no long term loan should be raised but that following the arrangements made in respect of the Unemployment programme the Treasury should,  if necessary, find cover or authorise short term borrowings if the rate of expenditure at any date exceeded the accumulation in the Suspense Account and if the other resources of the Road Fund at the moment were insufficient to finance the difference.January,  1987.
