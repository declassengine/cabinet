In their Second Report which was before the Cabinet on 2nd February last, the Committee Indicated the progress made with regard to the Bill:    since that date they have conferred with a Deputation from the Council of the Surveyors Instittffcior-and have considered suggestions made by a Deputation from the leasehold Reform Association which has recently been received by the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Home Affairs.3.   .

made the following proposals respecting compensation for loss of goodwill -&quot;They consider that when at the end of a term itiSubject to certain exceptions to which special attention is drawn below, the provisions of the draft Bill are basedon the reccnuiiendations contained in CP. 243 (26),I, 40     The Committee consider that Part I of the Bill whichIpensatlon&quot; jnpTrcve^ ia concerned with compensation for improvements and goodwill KsanSfckill to       should be confined to business premises.     The question ofJTcn^kef to goodwill does not arise in the case of residential propertyJHiejiV and the case of a residential tenant for compensation for improvements is not nearly so strong and is subject tofrom those that apply to different considerations / a business tenant.Effect Is given to this suggestion by clause 13 of the Bill.1:6ns at ion     5a     Clauses 1-3 relate to compensation for improvements. [Improve&quot;ijs. Only improvements made after the Bill becomes law will be eligible for compensation.     On further consideration theCommittee have decided not to incorporate in the Bill thesuggestion In paragraph 10 of C.P024:3 (26), that a tenantshould not he entitled to compensation for improvementsif the landlord could satisfy the tribunal that he baaoffered to allow the tenant to continue on reasonableterms and the tenant has refused the offer.6.     The Committee draw attention to the fact that:liability to pay compensation for improvements will\add to the complication and expense of investigation or pities.Sensation     7.     In paragraph 13 of their First Report, the Committee loss of
is proved to the satisfaction of the tribunal that the tenant of trade or business premises has created a goodwill attached to the demised premises, the financial benefit of which will, in the absence of arrangements to the contrary, accrue to the landlord, the tenant shall be entitled to compensation for any loss of good-will which may be caused by the removal of his business. The landlord however to have the option in lieu of paying compensation to offer the tenant an extension of his tenancy at the market rent of the premises irrespective of the goodwill, the rent and period of extension to be determined in case of dispute by the tribunal.     In certain cases it may be that the nost equitable solution is to be found in the acquisition by the tenant of the landlord&apos;s Interest in the demised premises, but while the tribunal night be empowered to resort to this alternative in very exceptional cases, it should only do so when satisfied that in no other way can the interests of all parties be effectively safeguarded&quot;8. Clause 4 of the Bill gives effect to the first and second of these proposals, it will be noticed that under proviso (a)    the sum to be awarded as compensationfor goodv;ill is not to exceed the capitalized value ofat the terminati on. of ,th e /ten ancy such addition to the letting value of the holcung/as fflay^be determined to be the direct result of the trade or business carried on by the tenant.9. It has been represented to the Committee that thepropos.Is contained in paragraph 13 of CP.243f26&apos;) will not suffice to deter an unconscionable landlord from extracting the utmost out of his tenants&apos; necessities.
The reasons for this opinion are set out in the extract from a memorandum Tby the Chief Valuer to the Board of Inland Revenue (Appendix I).10. Some members of the Committee have reached theconclusion that the only way in which the trade tenant can be effectively protected involves having recourse to some system under which in the absence of agreement between the parties, the tribunal will be empowered to prolong the tenancy, subject,  of course, to proper safeguards. It Is realised that this conclusion is contrary to the view expressed by the Committee In paragraph 4 of Cj?c843(26) against giving tenants a right of renewal, but It is thought that the plan proposed by the Chief Valuer and embodied in Clause 5 of the Bill is possibly less open to objection from the point of vis of the landlord than the proposal to givo the tribunal in certain exceptional cases power to compel a reluctant landlord&quot; to sell his property to his tenant.11. The proposal Is briefly as follows;-That where the landlord would in the ordinary course relet the premises, the outgoing tenant should have the right to apply to the Tribunal for a new lease on such terms apart from goodwill as a willing tenant  fother than: the outgoing tenant) would be likely to offers    If the Tribunal 1s satisfied that in all the circumstances a new tenancy oiigfe&apos; to bo granted they will be empowered to grant the application on such terms as. they may think fit.    It will be observed that before a tenant can succeed in his application for a renewal the Tribunal must ho satisfied in the following respects -
(1) that the oompcasBBtion provided for in-Clause 4 will not compensate the tenant for the loss suffered by removal to other premises.(2) that th.9 tenant is a suitableone(3) that the premises are not required for occupation by the landlord or one of his family, or if the landlord is a Government department or a public authority that the premises are not required for the purpose of the department or auth or I ty *(4) that the landlord does not require the premises for tho purpose of pulling down or re-modelling the buildingse(5) that the landlord does not requirethe premises to carry out a scheme of r&amp;-developinent of the props rty e(&amp;) that a renewal of the lease would he consistent with the principles of good cstato management,  regard being had to the development of any other property of the landlords.The decision of the Tribunal is to be final and bind-ing upon both landlord and tenant,  that is to say not only will the landlord be bound to grant b\it the tenant will be bound to accept a new lease on the terms settled by th e tribunal.Further, it is proposed (Clause 5 (5)) to allow,tire Tribune, but only on the application of the landlord, to offer the tenaiit as an alternative to and in substitution for a renewal of the lease the right to acquire the landlord^ interest in the premises on terms to be settled by the Tribunal,12.      The lord Chancellor (who has teen prevented by indisposition from attending recent meetings of the Committee) has written as follows with regard to Cl aus e 5 :-&quot;I do not much like this clause v;hich &quot;tends tc fir.ity of tenure..      My idea &quot;has always been that, unless the &quot;landlord offers a renewal, his  only &quot;obligation shall be to pay compen-&quot; sat ion for what the tenant leaves &quot;behind him&quot;.
14o Those members of the Committee who favour clause 5think that the safeguards already provided in the clause ins omethe interests of the landlord will excite/criticism, andthat the further protection suggested by the Xord PriyySeal will go far to render the clause inoperative by placing on the tenant a burden of proof which he can   nd*t sustain0page^forpea of pHing Recants15o The Committee have agreed -To reserve the question of the inclusion of Clause 5 in the Bill for determination by the Cabineto16n Clause 14 of the Bill gives effect to the proposals in paragraph 14 cf CcP* 243(26) respecting the limitation to be placed on damages for breach of covenants to repair and disputes as to repairs.      Clause ^&quot;/^carries out the proposal in paragraph 15 that in all future leases covenants against assigning or subletting without licence or consent are to be deemed to be subject to a proviso to the effect that such licence or consent is not to be unreasonably withheld,  and Clause 16 prohibits fines for consents toS. improvemen ts..13. The lord Privy Seal is also opposed to clause 5as at present drafted,  for the reasons set out in a Memorandum circulated to the Committee,  a copy of which is annexed (Appendix IT).      It will he observed that the lord Privy Seal considers that the only ease in which a tenant should he granted a right of renewal is when he can satisfy the Tribunal that the landlord is taking advantage of the tenantrs personal exigency (absence of suitable alternative accommodation or prohibitive cost of removal) to extract an unfair rent or an unconscionable fine as a condition of renewal o
17. The Leasehold Reform Association and. theSurveyors&apos; Institution have urged       that the Tribunal should be authorised to discharge a Lessee from all liability under a lease which he has assigned.      In paragraph 16 of CP. 243 (26) the Committee felt unable to recommend this proposal   as they thought it undesirable to modify existing contracts In this respect.    Provisions (Clause 15 (2)  ) have been included in the Bill in case the Cabinet wish to adopt the proposal.fie P^posod Ifriliunal.18. In paragraph 17 of CP0 243 (26) theCommittee recommended that the proposed Tribunal should consist of whole time official arbitrators appointed for the purposes of the Acquisition of Land. (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919, and sell selected by a Reference Committee under that Act and that in certain oases the Tribunal should be the local County Court,      On further consideration the Committee now favour a Tribunal consisting of arbitrators drawn from a panel of referees appointed by a Reference Committee consisting of the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls and the President of the SurveryorsT Institution.      Clause 18 gives effect to this proposal.     The Committee no longer wish to proceed with the suggestion that certain cases should be referred to the County Courts
19.The Comeittoe invite the Cabinet to determine whether the provisions of Clause 5 (giving the tenant a right of renewal of his lease in certain circumstances) and of Clause 15  (2) (liability of lessee after assignment) are to be retained in the Bill.Subject thereto the Committee recommend theCabinet -To give general approval to the draft Landlord and Tenant Bill and to authorise the introduction of the 3111 in the House of Commons in the form of the draft annexed to this Report, subject to such amendment in matters of detail as -may be found necessary or desirable.Signed on behalf of the Committee.

giPSvSlTlOEExtract from a Hemoraugurn b;/ the Ch i ef \Ta.1 ,u9r,Inland Revenue.While the utmost compensate on which landlords could reasonably be called upon to pay to outgoing tenants in respect of goodwill is that provided for in the Bill, viz,;- the capitalized value of such addition to the letting value of the holding as may be the direct result of the tenant7 s trade occupation, it will probably be found in practice that the protection which this affords to trade tenants is more apparent than realsProbably the necessity for legislation to protect the tenant&apos;s goodwill arises only from the fact that some unconscionable landlords take advantage of their position to extract from tenants the value of part o f t h el r go odw i 110To what extent do the provisions of the Draft Bill protect the tenant in such a case?Assume a tenant who is a trader desires to continue in occupation.      The property which he occupies is worth more to him than to anybody else.    His landlord, knowing this, desires to take advantage of it.    The tenant from necessity may be induced to offer or to agree to onerous terms short of the utmost value to him.    The tenanfs only alternative is to quit, either go out of business or carry  on elsevil ere.    If he gees out of business he loses, not only &quot;the Goodwill attached to the premises the benefit ol which will ensue to the-landlord&quot; but also, what is probably of much greater^ value, the Goodwill of his trade or business attaching to him personally or to his firm.     If he decides
to go elsewhere he must anticipate in addition to the cost of removal, some loss until he can re-establish his business in his new quarters end,  cf course, runs the risk which attaches to such a change.    Under the Bill tee t enont * a only remedy, having decided,  against his will, to quit, is to go to the tribunal for compensation.      In no circumstances can he hope to get, byway of compensation, a greater sum than the capital value of the goodwill7&apos;attached to the premises.&quot; But his loss, if he quits, must in fact be greater Would the Bill,  as drawn, prevent an unscrupulous landlord in such circumstances , taking advantage of the tenant&apos;s necessity and must we not anticipate that some tenants will still consent to be blackmailed rather than have to quit their holdings on these terms?A shrewd business tenant would probably be quite justified In so doing as he, in fact, would then suffer the lesser of two evils-Before the tribunal the tenant may run some risk of having his claim defeated altogether^    Although in the ciroumstances set out above, the tribunal could not hold that the landlord has offered a new tenancy on reasonable terms5 the landlord may be able to prove that no Goodwill attaches to the holding or that any Goodwill so attaching will not in fact &quot;ensue to the landlord&quot; having regard to the use to\ which he may be able to satisfy the %r5-bunal he intends t.o put the property and of which the tenant may be ignorant. On the other hand, the landlord may fear and the tenant hope that the tribunal would exercise its power to order a sale, but this power is to be put into operation only &quot;in exceptional circumstances if the tribunal is satisfied that in no other way can the interests of the parties be effectively safeguarded&quot; and, according to the Draft Bill as
drawn, at the time when the tenant is quitting.It Is possible that the only effective and practicable remedy so far as the tenant is concerned would be to give to the tribunal, power on the application of either landlord&apos; or tny trade tenant to determine at any time, within say,  12 months before the termination of the tenancy, whether a new tenancy shall be granted or not and if granted, upon what terms - subject to a proviso that in no case shall they order such renewal of tenancy unless they are satisfied that that course is reasonable and that by refusal, the tenant1a loss in respect of goodwill would be greater than the landlord ls lose in tbe event of renewal, for which purpose the landlordrs interest in neighbcuring property must be taken into consideration.     But, from the landlords point of view this proposal is open to the reasonable criticism that in order to avoid loss to the tenant, the landlord may have to suffer loss.    To meet this point and for the landlords proper protection, the tribunal might be given power to decide that a renewal of the tenancy is unreasonable in any case where either the tenant fails to satisfy the tribunal that he is a suitable one or the * landlord satisfies them, either that  :-a. He intends to occupy the premises himself of by one of his own family,b. He intends to pull down or remodel the build ings,or c. He requires vacant possession in order to carry out a scheme of redevelopment of property,or indeed that there is any other sufficient reason why: a new tenancy should not be granted on reasonable terms, having regard to the circumstances of the case, and at a rent not less than tbe value in the open market apartS.
from the Goodwill.    In other words in all esses where the landlord cannot Batisfy the tribunal thet he does not contemplate a new tenancy in favour of some one other, perhaps, than a member of his own family and provided they, are satisfied that the tenant is a suitable one. the tribunal might have power to fix terms for a renewal of the tenancy by the existing tenant in accordance with the principles which should govern good estate management limiting the maximum new term to a period of say 14 years, or such extended period  (if any) as may be agreed upon between the parties.      If this proposal Is adopted the power to the tribunal to order a sale of the landlord^ interest could be deleted from the Bill.      Some such machinery as this may provide the necessary check upon that relatively small class of unreasonable landlords who are responsible for the necessity of the clause and whilst protecting acceptable tenants, should not unduly hamper the good landlord. In any case where no renewal is granted compensation payable for Goodwill would be limited to that attaching to the property and which would ensue to the landlordsG, J.

(26) 15.&apos; &quot; 0 A B I B S T.LjjASEEGLD .cBFRAE CH IlJlliaTT GQEdlvIITTSiil .Mejgorandjjjg by the I^rd Privy Seal.It has teen suggested that at the end of the term of a lease every leaseholder should have the right of renewal at a reasonable rent - that is to say, we have been asked to sanction the principle of dual ownership in the form of fixity cf tenure and fair rent. The Committee have very properly considered this to be unacceptable.     We are not &quot;willing to recognise any form of dual ownership.      The  truth is that the advocates of&quot; this change are not consistent with them-selves.      They admit exceptions which are fatal to their principle.      There Is,   they concede,   to be no right of, renewal where the owner is resuming the premises for his own occupation, uor where it is intended to demolish the premises under a scheme of development. These exceptions seem to me to be, according to their principle,absurd.      If the tenant has acquired rights of ownership in leasehold property the motive governing the landlord1s intention to refuse renewal cannot derogate from the tenant1s rights.    The enjoyment of his property,  cr the money value of it, cannot depend upon the accident of the landlord1s intention.If,   then, we wore to have adopted this crippled principle cf part ownership of the tenant apart from its inherent injustice, we should have been plunged in hopeless confusion.      In my judgment the
only principle In. leasehold reform upon which it is safe to proceed is that the landlord should not acquire for his own benefit what has been added by the tenant.    In existing contracts undoubted-ly the tenant must be deemed to have received the appropriate con-sideration in the terms of the lease,  to which he agreed with his eyes open as to the consequences.    But nevertheless,  it has the appearance of injustice,   and of course in particular instances the substance of injustice too.    And it is in the interests of public policy that this appearance of injustice should far the future be avoided,  and therefore It is advisable in all future contracts to preclude the owner from acquiring at the end of a lease value which he himself has not added and for which he is not going expressly to pay.    Tenants improvements are obvious examples of the  ease contern-plated.    Tenants goodwill similarly,  if taken over for the landlord1s benefit,  are another example.    It follows however that if the land-lard is going to pull down the house, he is not going to take over the benefit ef the improvements or -;f the good will,  and no com-pensation is due.     Similarly,  if he is going to occupy it himself for some other trade to which the goodwill does not belong he is not going to acquire any addition which he himself has not provided. And even where the former trade is to be continued the goodwill which the landlord acquires is evidently only the goodwill attaching to the premises and not the goodwill attaching to the outgoing tenant himself.But are these two categories - improvements and goodwill attaching to the premises - the only matters belonging to the tenant which the landlord, ought not to acquire in future leases without compensation?    I think there is yet another category. When a tenancy comes to an end the landlord had the opportunity of exacting from the exigency of the tenant payments not justified by the value of the premises.      I mean there is something beyond the goodwill attaching to the premises which the tenant has created and which,  as the present law stands,  the unscrupulous landlord can. turn into money. Circumstances may make it
impossible for the tenant to carry away not merely the goodwill attaching to the premises,   but his personal goodwill attaching to himself, without grave loss,  e.g., &quot;because there are no other premises available to which he can remove; or because the costs of removal are prohibitive.      An unscrupulous owner finding his tenant in this position may take advantage of this exigency to extract an unfair rent or -an unconscionable fine as the condition of renewal.      This case appears to me to call for redress if it be practicable. And I suggest for consideration that in this case - and this case alone - the tribunal should have the right to order a renewal of the lease upon conditions which ma;/ seems  to it to be fair.       Unless there are fatal objections which may-be urged against such a provision it might be provided, that where a tenant alleges that the landlord is taking advantage not of the market value but of the tenant&apos;s personal exigency ha may appeal to the tribunal and if he succeeds the tribunal should have a free hand tr order a renewal and fix the terms of it.      But it -would be evidently necessary to provide a safeguard against litigious appeals, in the shape I presume of substantial costs,  if the appeal f ai Is.(Intld .)    s.Si Arlington: Street,S . !i&apos;y .     1 *March 11th.  1927.
