In the main they relate to persons who had claims to benefit current and were not at work on the dates given.(2.) The figures above for December 1926 and January 1927 are exclusive of persons in the Coal-milling Industry who remained disqualified for unemployment benefit under the trade dispute disqualification.(3.) The latest figure available, viz., for the week ended the 14th February, 1927, is given in Part (D) of this Report.The percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the undermentioned dates was January 26, 1925      .... .... .... ....   Ill25, 1926 .... .... ....   10*7,,     24,1927       .... .... .... ....   11-9 (men only 13-8)The table given above shows that during the five weeks ended the 31st January the numbers on the registers fell by 19,502. The reduction would have been much greater but for the large seasonal increase in unemployment which took place in[15801j
the last week of the year. A comparison of the position on the 31st January with that on the 3rd of the month will show that during these four weeks unemploy-ment fell by over 150,000. The number on the registers at the end of the month was, however, still considerably in excess of that on the 26th April, 1926, i.c, immediately before the strike and of the number at the end of January 1926.(B.)-Analysis of the Number of Persons on the Registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at the 31st January, 1927.-	Men.

Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 24th January, 1927, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 12*1, as compared with 11&apos;9 at the 20th December, 1926, with 1P0 at the 25th January, 1926, and with 1P2 at the 26th January, 1925. The figures at the 24th January, 1927, in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month, with the 26th April, 1926, a/nd with a year ago are given in the table below : Industry. .

In the pig-iron trade it is reported that there were more blast furnaces in operation at the end of January than at the corresponding date last year and the extent of recovery which took place in this industry during the month may be judged from the fact that the percentage of unemployment has fallen from 44-7 to 20&apos;3.   The improvement in the iron and steel trades was also
of a substantial nature, and it is reported that in most areas there is still a considerable amount of work in hand, part of which, no doubt, represents orders accumulated during the coal-mining dispute. The further recovery in shipbuilding, which was made possible by the increasing availability of constructional material, was most marked on the North-East Coast, Scotland and Wales. In the first two areas, however, the depression remained acute, approximately 50 per - cent, on the North-East Coast and 40 per cent, in Scotland of shipbuilding workers remaining unemployed. In engineering the improvement which took place was confined mostly to general and marine engineering, and the volume of unemploy-ment in this industry still remained very high. In one area only Scotland is the employment position in engineering better than it was a year ago.The decreased unemployment in the cotton industry was shared by all departments. In the Egyptian spinning section the employment position is stated to be satisfactory, but in the American section there is still an appreciable amount of short-time working and under-employment.As regards the position in coal mining, It will be observed from the above table that the number of miners recorded as unemployed on the 24th January is considerably greater than on the 20th December. It must be remembered, however, that the December figures exclude a very much greater proportion of miners disqualified under the Trade Dispute disqualification than the January figures. According to the returns received by the Mines Department, the volume of employment in coal mining was considerably greater in January than in the previous month. In some areas, however, notably Wales and Durham, the percentage of unemployment in coal mining is still very high. The increase in unemployment in the woollen and worsted industries, and which was also apparent in a lesser degree in the silk, hosiery, bleaching and dyeing industries, was largely of a seasonal nature. The usual New Year slackness must also be held responsible for the relapse in the distributive trades, wdiile the increase in unemployment in the building industry must also be largely attributed to the seasonal causes.(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figure of unemployment published is that for the 14th February, giving the total number on the registers as 1,270,200.   This is a decrease over the position on the 31st January amounting to 61,343, and an increase over a . year ago of 130,972.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,February 25, 1927.
