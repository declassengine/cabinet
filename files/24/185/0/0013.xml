Printed for the Cabinet.Draft Note to the Soviet Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires.Sir,THE relations existing between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Govern-ment of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics continue notoriously to be of an unsatisfactory nature.On the 4th June, 1923, the Soviet Government solemnly signed the following agreement: &quot; The Soviet Government undertakes not to support with funds or in any other form persons or bodies or agencies or institutions whose aim is to spread discontent or to foment rebellion in any part of the British Empire . . . . and to impress upon its officers and officials the full and continuous observance of these conditions.&quot;In recalling the terms of this agreement in his note of the 24th October, 1924, to M. Rakovsky, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald stated that &quot; No Government will ever tolerate an arrangement with a foreign Government by which the latter is in formal diplomatic relations of a correct kind with it, whilst at the same time a propagandist body organically connected with that foreign Government encourages and even orders subjects &apos; of the former to plot and plan revolutions for its overthrow. Such conduct is not only a grave departure from the rules of international comity, but a violation of specific and solemn undertakings repeatedly given to His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;In spite of this warning it has been necessary for me on more than one occasion vo draw the attention of the Soviet representative in this country to the continuous breach of this solemn engagement. So long as the present rulers of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, be they technically members of the Govern-ment or members of the Politbureau, which is the real dominating authority in the Union, or its ambassadors abroad, persist in making public utterances in defamation of Great Britain or in advocacy of a world revolution, no improve-ment is possible. His Majesty&apos;s Government must once again draw attention to the warning given by my predecessor.This public attitude of men holding high positions in Russia is, moreover, totally inconsistent with the profession of goodwill&apos; given privately by the representatives of the Soviet Government in this country. For instance, M. Krassin, late Charge dAffaires of the Soviet Union in London, informed me in October last that he was instructed to state that it was the real desire of the Soviet Government to remove causes, of difficulty and to establish friendly relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government. Yet while this very instruction was being carried out by M. Krassin a regular campaign of public slander and misrepresentation against Great Britain was in process, and not even the Commissar for Foreign Affairs himself, who was, at least nominally, the author of these instructions, could refrain from taking part in this campaign.His Majesty&apos;s Government are indeed well aware of the delusion under which M. Chicherin and many of his colleagues are suffering that Great Britain is continually occupied in plotting against the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics and for this purpose has never ceased to guide the policy of such countries as Poland and the Baltic States and Persia into an orientation directed against Soviet Russia. No impartial study of the policies of those countries, no dis-passionate examination of facts and no assurances from His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have availed to dispel an obsession which is as illogical as it is ill-founded. Its  continuance,  therefore,  can  only  be  based  on  a  rooted,  even perhaps3774a [15653] [15805] b
temperamental, hostility in the minds of the Soviet authorities themselves and a corresponding credulity in regard to false reports from interested informants. M. Chicherin himself, in a particularly hostile speech delivered on the 6th December to representatives of the press in Berlin, openly displayed this preference for bad over good sources of information. Out of a mass of inaccurate and tendencious statements it is only necessary to make a single selection in order to illustrate the distorted vision of British policy that appears to haunt the nervous mind of M. Chicherin. He declared that the British periodical &quot; The Near East &quot; had threatened Persia with trouble fomented by Great Britain if she did not show herself amenable to British desires. An examination of &quot; The Near East &quot; would have, shown that no such threat had appeared in it and His Majesty&apos;s Government have the right to protest against the malevolent bias which makes pure inventions the basis or support of its policy.   (Appendix No. 1.)The same credulity and hostility are shown by M. Voroshilov, People&apos;s Commissar for War, in his speech to new commanders and political workers in the Soviet army on the 17th September as reported in the Soviet press; and by M. Unschlicht, Vice-Commissar for War, in his article in the &quot; Pravda &quot; of the 15th September. Extracts from the speeches referred to are attached to this note for purpose of reference.   (Appendices Nos. 2 and 3.)Again, an Ambassador of the Union, M. Kamenev, was recently reported as stating that the present leaders of the Communist party devoted undue attention to the internal welfare of the Union instead of &quot;concentrating their efforts on revolution in foreign countries. The selection as Ambassador of a man who could make such a complaint is a curious comment on the professed desire of the Soviet Government for friendly relations with foreign countries.Even more aggressive in its hostility towards the British Empire is the chief organ of the Communist party, the Politbureau, which, as has already been mentioned, is the real Government of Russia and which cannot escape from identified-fication as such, despite all assertions to the contrary. It will be sufficient to quote from the speeches of one of its leading members, M. Bukhaidn, at the conference of the party and at the enlarged plenary session of the Executive Committee of the Communist International held in Moscow7 in October and November last. The following quotations will suffice as illustrations of his attitude on those occasions: &quot; In the event of the further victorious advance of the Canton armies, it is no Utopia to assert that a victorious Chinese revolution will find an immediate echo in the neighbouring colonial countries India, Indonesia and Dutch India. All this makes China a mighty centre of attraction for the colonial periphery.&quot;&quot; The English miners&apos; strike and the national revolution in China are, it seems to me, the chief spots where Communist parties must apply their efforts, if we do not count the Soviet Union. . . . And I think that, as regards these three lines of policy, we have no reason whatsoever to be pessimistic. ...&quot;&quot; We must be ready for anything, and must continue to support the miners&apos; strike with unrelaxed energy. That is why I think that it is fit and meet to end my closing speech at our Fifteenth Party Conference with the following cry : &apos; Hail to the English miners !&apos; . . . .&quot;&quot; Even should the Anglo-Russian Committee be fated to live a short life (a prospect which objectively we take into account), we have already advanced a number of auxiliary trenches, as, for instance, the Anglo-Russian Miners&apos; Committee, &amp;c. . . .&quot;&quot; It is perfectly clear that we must now concentrate the principal and central attack of the Chinese people, of the Kuo Min-tang and of the Communist party into a war against foreign imperialists. ...&quot;&quot; Mighty masses are marching under the Soviet star under the banner of Communism. Comrades! Our proletariat is ready to do everything to strengthen the forces of world revolution and to facilitate the process thereof.. Has not our party proved that it will do everything necessary to defend the cause of world revolution ? . . . . During the great English strike, during the great China revolution, our party we can and dare to assert this  has shown itself in the fore-front. And we here declare that if history shall produce still greater tasks we will throw all our forces into the scale of world revolution and will fight to a victorious finish . . . .&quot;
These attacks by M. Bukharin on the British Empire received the direct approval of the Soviet Government in a speech by M. Rykov, president of the Soviet of People&apos;s Commissars, on the 3rd November, when he congratulated the Party Conference on the unanimity with which its resolutions had been adopted.The last two quotations illustrate the futility of the pretence that the attacks on British interests in China are not instigated and directed by the Soviet Union. The policy of encouragement and, assistance to those attacks is, moreover, openly avowed by M. Karakhan, late Soviet Ambassador in Peking, in his speech at Vladivostok, reported in the &quot; Rupor &quot; of the 10th October, 1926. (Appendix No. 4.)Again, M. Semashko, Commissar of Health, in a letter published in the &quot; Rabochaya Gazeta &quot; on the 11th September, repeats his view that contests in the domain of physical culture between Soviet citizens and foreigners &quot; are only admissible where they respond to the interests of the revolutionary movement in the country in question.&quot; The aggressive spirit is so strong that all other considerations are subordinated to the cause of revolution.The hostile character of the contents of the Soviet press is also notorious. Disregarding other organs, it is sufficient to point out that the &quot; Izvestiya &quot; is stated in a decree of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union to be the official organ of the Central Executive Committee; its publishing office is described as a State organ not pursuing objects of commercial profit, and it is exempted from all State taxes. The Soviet Government are therefore directly responsible for what appears in it, that is to say, for such things as the letter of the Executive Committee of the Communist International in support of the general strike in Great Britain (&quot; Izvestiya,&quot; 8th May, 1926 (Appendix No. 5) ); the leading article on the same subject (Appendix No. 6); the appeal of the Moscow Soviet in support of the strike.(Appendix No. 7) ; the order of the Central Council of Trades Unions regarding financial support for the general strike and the miners&apos; strike (&quot; Izvestiya,&quot; 11th May (Appendix No. 8)) ; the manifesto of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (&quot; Izvestiya,&quot; 26th June (Appendix No. 9) ) ; the articles on alleged British policy in Persia (2nd and 8th October (Appendices Nos. 10 and 11).) ; and above all the grossly insulting and mendacious cartoon on the front page of the issue of the 29th December (depicting the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as applauding the execution of Lithuanian Communists): and the leading article in the same number on the same subject (Appendix No. 12).In recording this deplorable attitude of the Soviet leaders, His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of embarking on a controversy with them. Publicly recorded speeches and articles in official organs are incontrovertible facts, about which no argument is possible. Nor can the Soviet Government be under the illusion that their sentiments have passed unnoticed in this country. Not only have they been reported in the daily press, but from time to time men of authority have been compelled to give expression to the indignation inspired by the open hostility of the Soviet Government to the British Empire and their public attacks on British interests. To embody these complaints in a formal note of protest might in the circumstances seem superfluous. But it is right that there should be no misconception in Russia or elsewhere as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter. The toleration they are showing to Soviet agents and citizens is not to be confounded with ignorance of their designs, nor is prolonged silence in protesting to be taken as implying acquiescence in the unprecedented relationship between the two countries.His Majesty&apos;s Government have persistently striven for peace. In the foregoing account of the grievous outrages and injuries to British interests committed by or through the agency of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics they have drawn only upon sources of information already open to the whole world. Thus limited, it is still sufficient to show what patience and forbearance, in the face of repeated and almost unendurable provocation, have been shown by His Majesty&apos;s Government in their desire to avoid any action which might still further embitter public feeling on either side or add to the anxieties of other nations.His Majesty&apos;s Government are not concerned with the domestic affairs of Russia nor with its form of Government so long as that Government refrains from interference with purely British concerns and abstains from hostile action or propaganda against British subjects. But they consider it necessary to warn the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics in the gravest terms that there are limits beyond which it is dangerous to drive the temper of a self-respecting people, and [15653] b 2
that a continuance of such acts as are here complained of must sooner or later render inevitable the severance of even the appearance of friendly relations between the two Governments and the withdrawal of their respective missions.His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that this protest and warning will be received by the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics with the attention it requires, and that no further cause of complaint may be given to them.Annex. (1.1Extract from M. Chicherin s Speech to Press Representatives in Berlin,December 6, 1926.IT is remarkable with what brutal frankness the English periodical, &quot; The Near East,&quot; which is in close touch with the Colonial Office, recently disclosed the relations between the British Empire and awakening Persia. It stated clearly that, if the Persian Government did not become amenable to England, wild tribes and other similar factors would be exploited against t*he Persian Government.(2.)Extract from Soviet Press Report of M. Vorosliilov&apos;s Speech of September 17, 1926.COMRADE VOROSHILOV drew them a picture of the secret machinations of English imperialism egging on the small States, its faithful hirelings, against the Soviet Union.(3.)Extract from Article by M. Unschlicht in &quot; Pravda,&quot; September 15, 1926.THE most insatiable appetite, the greatest irreconcilability towards the U.S.S.R., is shown by -England, who is expending all her efforts and means to consolidate her domination in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. In Europe England is striving to create a military bloc against us, though it be formed only of the States on our frontiers. The Baltic States, Poland and Roumania are the territories which are to be first to hurl their armed forces against us. By the will of English imperialism the warlike Marshal Pilsudski is dictator in Poland. Poland, Roumania and the Baltic States are arming at the expense of English capital.(4.)Extract from the &quot; Rupor&quot; of October 10, 1926.(Translation.) -Karakhan on the &quot;Guilt of Moscow.&quot;KARAKHAN, the ex-Ambassador of Moscow, during his stay at Vladivostok addressed a large assembly with a report on the political situation of the moment.After explaining the state of affairs in China, Karakhan dealt at considerable length with the accusations made against the U.S.S.R. and against him personally, as Ambassador. In order to vindicate his policy, he made the following statements: &quot; I would also like to say a few words about the accusations brought against the U.S.S.R.&quot; It appears that we are the cause of all the trouble in China. All oivil commotions and unrest in China are attributed to us, and also the fact that Canton has a good army and that Peng Yu Hsiang fought against Imperialists. We are the incarnation of all mortal sins.
&quot; It must be said that we never hide our sins, and, if guilty, always admit it openly.&quot; Of course we are guilty, and our guilt is a considerable one. First of all this guilt of ours consists of the circumstance that we are existing for almost nine years. It consists of our having raised a revolt against our internal imperialism, against our landlords, against the bourgeoisie. The Imperialists wanted to crush us, but we revolted, wei&apos;e victorious, and expelled them from our country. Then they wanted to make us see reason by means of guns and to compel us to alter our system of government. But the gun argument failed and now we are being talked to in a more polite manner, sitting at green conference tables.&quot; China is aware of this, and we are not sparing our efforts in making things clear to the people of China.&quot; To our happiness and satisfaction, we see that China begins to under-stand.   Of this we, of course, are guilty.&quot; But I think that, although we are charged with doing so, we shall not alter our policy. No matter whoever it should be, myself or someone else we shall be unanimous in saying that imperialism can be combated-only fighting must be more co-ordinated.&quot; I think that China will embark on this enterprise in earnest. &quot;&quot; We have concluded a good agreement with China.   The Tsar used to rob them.   All foreign Powers are robbing them, and behaving as if they were at home.&quot; You know already all about the Wanhsien incident. It is true that some fifteen Englishmen were killed there, but afterwards the English despatched a naval squadron and killed 2,000 people.&quot; Such occurrences are not rare in China. Tne Chinese duly appreciate such actions on the part of Imperialists, and when we come and put an end to all the robbing done in the past and say to the Chinese, &apos; You are our revolu-tionary brother; we are both fighting for a common cause&apos; he understands.&quot; Of course this is a great sin from the point of view of the Imperialist.&quot; But we cannot help it, because we are unable to alter our nature.&quot; There is one thing more. During the whole period of our contact with China, we always openly pointed out her sores and gave advice how to heal them. And this is called propaganda. Why ? we wonder. We do not attempt to convince China to embark upon Socialist activities and to organise a Soviet Republic.   We are merely saying : &apos; You are being robbed.   Oust the robbers.&apos;&quot; I think that this policy of encouraging and assisting by advice based on our own experience, taking advantage of which the Chinese might more effectively and speedily expel Imperialists from their native country-this policy will not be changed. I can say more: I think that we will help the people of China to unbend its back in a thorough fashion.&quot; And whatever accusations may be brought against us, we will not change our policy in this connection.   We will be firm in spite of all threats.&quot;(5.)Summary from &quot; Izvestiya&quot; of May 8, 1926.Letteu to English Communists.THE whole world&apos;s proletariat watches with the greatest delight the British working classes gigantic struggle. However it ends, one thing is clear : England has entered a new epoch; the England of old is no more ; a new England is being born. Lenin&apos;s writings on the English Labour movement of 1911-12 show that he prophesied exactly what we see: and Liebknecht, who compared it to a vast steam-roller at rest, realised it also.Even in the front ranks of the English Labour movement there remains survivors of the old social-democratic federation, survivors in particular of the doctrinnaire ideas of Hyndman. Hyndman considered that the &quot;real Marxist&quot; should only occupy himself with making propaganda for the theory of Socialism, and that questions of wages, working hours, &amp;c, were of little account to a Marxist.   &quot; That
is not Marxism, that is a Cabinet caricature of Marxism. The aim of the true Communist in England consists in being in the first row, being the most experienced, the most unwavering, the most decisive defender of all the interests of the workers in such spheres as those of the little everyday questions of a worker&apos;s ordinary life, of wages, of the working day, of the needs of the unemployed, of a drop of milk for the worker&apos;s children, &amp;c.&quot; To assert that the present strike is only an economic struggle is either to misunderstand completely the character of events or else deliberately to mislead the workers. &quot; The strike arose on economic grounds, but from the first minute it has had a great political significance. Every day the working masses will see this more and more clearly. Class against class that is the formula which defines the struggle that has begun in Great Britain. And any class warfare is political warfare.&quot; The workers are headed by the T.U.C., who are the &quot; Strike Committee &quot; of the bourgeoisie, and the Conservative Government by ... . Baldwin&apos;s Cabinet. This alone shows how clearly defined a political character this new strike has. The Communist party must illuminate the road for millions of workers, propound new slogans as the movement itself grows, and lift it &quot; to the highest forms of the fight of the labouring class for liberation and for power.&quot; Telegrams tell us that the first worker&apos;s blood has already been shed. &quot;And now each hour the English boitrgeoisie will give the English workers new examples of the way in which economic questions change into political questions.&quot;Masks have now been taken off. The Baldwin Conservative Government conies forward almost openly as the executive organ of-the lockers-out, as the Strike Committee of the factory-owners; and this Government will hourly become more and more detested by the workers. &quot; Therefore the question of creating a Labour Government in England will acquire ever more reality. Communists in Prance, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Italy have hitherto advanced the slogan of a Labour Government, and this slogan will be advanced with still greater force in Great Britain. And it is easy to understand that it is not a question of a fictitious margerinery &apos; Labour&apos; Government, but of a Labour Government which will take upon itself to realise the demands of the workers; which will be able to carry out the nationalisation of the coal industry; which will be able to satisfy the demands of the present struggle ; which will give work to the unemployed, &amp;c.&quot;Whatever be the immediate end of the movement, the Bolshevisation of the proletarian vanguard, i.e., the victory of Lenin&apos;s ideas in the proletarian vanguard of Great Britain, will now proceed at a far greater speed than it has hitherto. The conscious proletarians of the whole world are amazed at the great organising capacity shown by the strikers in England. The English trades union movement has now a chance of paying its debt to the labour class for whole decades. There is no doubt that so great a movement will lead to the creation of new forms of labour organisation, forms which are already nascent in the proletarian masses.Wherever you can speak to English workers, convey to them the Communist International&apos;s feeling of delight at the struggle which they have begun. Call on them to stand fast till the end; call on them to watch carefully the manipulations of the Right leaders, who have undertaken to &quot;help &quot; in directing the strike. The attempt of MacDonald and Henderson to go behind the T.U.C.&apos;s back and start negotiations with Churchill throws light on the true physiognomy of these leaders. We are afraid that Thomas and Co. want to repeat on a bigger scale their treachery of &quot;Black Friday&quot; in 1921. Communists must warn the English workers against these gentlemen. &quot; It is our business to tell the English workers that Thomas and Co., who are within the Labour camp, are more dangerous to the movement than all Baldwin&apos;s O.M.S.&quot;(Greetings ! )(Executive Committee, Communist International.)(6.)Summary of Leading Article from &quot; Izvestiya &quot; of May 8.On a United Front.THE English bourgeoisie has done no good by arming itself for the present conflict and by procrastinating ; it is not simply a question of reducing wages, it is something far greater, of which the results will be long enduring. It is a question of the comparative decline of the importance of English industry on the world
market a decline which the English bourgeoisie has attempted to arrest by force of arms, by annihilating its dangerous rival Germany, &amp;c, but the United States of America, Prance, Japan, and even Germany herself have become dangerous rivals, &quot; dirty competitors.&quot;2. The bourgeoisie none the less wishes to hold its losing position, and has found only one means of doing so an increasing pressure on the working class. &quot; It is not a matter of falling upon some separate section of the working class, on the miners who compose less than 10 per cent, of the total of the English industrial workers. From its very beginning the conflict took  on this very grim form, and from its very beginning the bourgeoisie ^took up such an attitude of challenge, because the issue will solve the great question whether the bourgeoisie is to succeed in gripping the working class in such a vice that it will bear the burden of payment for strengthening capitalist England on the world market.3. The bourgeois press of France says : &quot; They ought to follow our example.&quot; What has happened is this : owing to the falling valuta the French bourgeoisie is exerting a permanent pressure on the working class, but this pressure has not the appearance of a direct attack on them, of a direct reduction of wages it can even be accompanied by a rise. But the French triumph is premature. This method of winning markets by exerting pressure on the working classes is one that had to be paid for heavily afterwards, as is shown by the example of Germany and Poland. The fall of the franc is becoming catastrophic as a result of events in England, and those in France who have long vision are already very disturbed.4. But conditions are otherwise in England, where the valuta is steady and the capitalists had only one path, that of exerting pressure directly on the worker; and the proletariat of England has seen that the blow aimed directly at the miners affects the English proletariat as a whole.5. The news shows that the whole proletariat of Europe is beginning to understand the world sense of the class conflict in England. It is England, not Germany, which has begun to play the leading role in the Labour movement in the west of Europe. The proletariat of the west begins to understand that the victory or defeat of the English workers is the victory or defeat of the workers of France, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia. &quot; We need scarcely speak of the Labour class of the U.S.S.R. However little it expected the sweep and form of the conflict which has flared up, it at once understood what its revolutionary duty demanded of it. This is made clear once more by the announcement printed below of the transfer by the Soviet Trade Unions of 2 million roubles in addition to the 250,000 already handed over for their brothers on strike in England.&quot;(7.)Summary from &quot; Izvestiya&quot; of May 8.AFTER the report upon events in England, the Moscow Soviet authorised the following appeal to all workers, male and female, of Moscow: (Extracts.)&quot; . . . . The struggle. cannot be strange to the working class of the Soviet Union. We are only one detachment of the world&apos;s proletarian army.....&quot; Against the proletarians of England stands the as yet unbroken, though decaying, forces of the English capitalists. She will be helped by the consolidated capitalist front of the whole world. World capital is lending all its powers to crush the proletarian army, to. suffocate at birth the incipient proletarian revolution.&quot; The English workers are as yet only defending their immediate vital interests, but the English workers who have struck have decided to defend their class rights to the end.&quot; The proletariat of the whole world must support the struggle which the English workers have begun. We, proletarians of the &apos; Red&apos; capital of the Soviet Union of Socialist Republics, must take the first place in giving this help. We know better than others the weight of all those privations which are bound up with year-long proletarian struggles.
(8.)Translation from &quot;Izvestiya&quot; of May 11.Order of the All-Russian Central Council of Trades Unions concerningSupport to the English Miners.IN organising collections among the workers of the Soviet Union on behalf of the miners on strike in England, the All-Russian Central Council of Trades Unions (&quot;V.Ts.S.P.S.&quot;) was acting upon two considerations: (i) The principle of class solidarity among the workers of all countries, and (ii) the special treaty as to the united front between the English and Soviet Trades Unions established by the creation of the Anglo-Soviet Committee of Unity. The working class of the Soviet Union would consider its debt to the English working class unpaid had it not been the first to respond with assistance for its brothers on strike in England. These are the principles which the V.Ts.S.P.S. was following when it organised collections and transferred 2,250,000 roubles to aid its brothers on strike in England. The V.Ts.S.P.S. considers it necessary to observe that the working masses of the Soviet Union responded enthusiastically to this appeal for help, and in a whole number of districts and undertakings the workers subscribed considerably more than was proposed in the appeals of the V.Ts.S.P.S. and the Central Committees of the Trades Unions.However, the V.Ts.S.P.S. has learned that the General Council of English Trades Unions refuses to accept the help of the Soviet Unions; that it refuses also to acecpt monetary help in general from all foreign trade unions. &quot;We have received,&quot; says the General Council, &quot; numerous proposals of financial aid from abroad, but, desiring to persuade the public that we are not following revolutionary aims, we have refused them, just as we have refused the proposals made to us from Russia.&quot;The V.Ts.S.P.S. cannot proceed to a judgment of the General Councils refusal of aid, just as it cannot proceed to a judgment of the motives for this refusal; but it cannot but take account of the General Councils refusal of help as being a fact.In view, therefore, the V.Ts.S.P.S. decrees: 1. To return to the V.Ts.S.P.S. the sums which were transferred to the General Council.2. To continue collections in aid of the English miners.3. To place all the moneys collected in a special fund in aid of the English miners so that this whole fund shall be at the disposal of the General Council or the union of English miners on their first demand.May 10, 1926.A. DOGADOV, Secretary of the V.Ts.8.P.S.&quot; The Plenum of the Moscow Soviet of Workers, Red Army and Peasants&apos; Deputies call on all toilers of the capital, in the first place male and female workers, to take the liveliest part in organising both material and moral help for the English strikers, and every honest toiler must contribute a part of his wages to help them. Every factory, every works, every organisation must send an expression of brotherly solidarity and sympathy to the English proletariat. The English workers in the most difficult moment of their struggle must feel that they are not alone, that with them is the working class of the whole world, with them the victorious working class of our Union.....&quot;(Plenum of the Moscow Soviet of Workers and Red Army Deputies.)
To the Workers of England !   To the Workers of all Lands !   The Coal-miners&apos; Strike in Peril !A NUMBER of new circumstances convince &apos;&apos; Comintern&apos;&apos; that the coal-miners&apos; strike is in the greatest danger.The miners&apos; bosses have entered into an agreement with the General Council to postpone the conference of the executive committees of the trades unions which was due to be held on the 25th June. Furthermore, the miners&apos; bosses have agreed that all criticism of the action of the General Council, which betrayed the general strike, should be suspended.This is a fact of enormous importance. In agreeing to this, the leaders of the Coal-miners&apos; Federation have put the miners&apos; strike in an &quot;extremely dangerous situation.The General Council delayed the convocation of the Conference of the Executive Committees in order that it might not be forced to give any kind of a public account of its treacherous conduct in connection with the general strike and in order to reinforce to some slight extent its shattered authority among the working masses.And what now ? Now we have the bosses of the miners consciously or mistakenly-helping the General Council &quot;to gain time&quot; in order the better to deceive the workers and to ensure that all shall remain as of old in the governing clique of English trades unionism.The General Council&apos;s present agreement with the miners&apos; leaders is nominally directed to supporting the miners&apos; strike, but it can only be called a new manoeuvre of deceit. This deceit is revealed, among other things, by the fact that at the same time as the agreement was published there appeared in the press an intimation from the leaders of the transport and railway workers to the effect that in the matter of rendering material assistance to the miners the transport and railway workers are bound by the agreement which they concluded with the owners after the general strike.The declarations of Smith, the president of the Federation of Miners, have in the last days borne an ambiguous character. Equally wrong have been the recent declarations of Cook, which he made at the meeting in Charlestown, where he described the last conference of the miners&apos; leaders with the General Council as &quot; a meeting of the highest importance.&quot; Such declarations can only spread harmful illusions. What we have here is direct sabotage of the miners&apos; strike by one section of the General Council&apos;s present leaders, and the dissimulation of this sabotage by the other section.In the last days the General Council&apos;s leaders, upon whom betrayal of the general strike weighs heavily, have given vent to some bitter-sweet utterances directed against the right wing of the Conservatives, which has been aiming at a rupture of relations with the U.S.S.R. Citrine&apos;s empty semi-official phrases are worth no more than the &quot;diplomatic&quot; observations in Parliament on this theme of &quot;Mr. MacDonald himself.&quot;It is indubitable that the working masses of England are indignant at the Conservatives&apos; provocation against the U.S.S.R. ; it is also indubitable that this protest will increase. But the campaign against Birkenhead, Churchill and Co., who are striving for a rupture with&quot; the U.S.S.R., should not be waged in England in the way in which it is being waged by the General Council leaders, who are, in fact, transforming this campaign into a &quot;deceitful manoeuvre to screen the capitula-tion they are preparing for the miners&apos; strike. This question should be put openly, directly ^ honourably, in the proletarian way, and not in the way that MacDonald and Citrine are putting it.&quot;One of the reasons for the postponement (of the conference of the executive committees of the trades unions) is the effort to form a united front of the English trades union movement in order to repulse the assaults on the U.S.S.R.&quot;-that is what Cook declares in his last interview. Apparently, the General Council leaders have succeeded in convincing someone or other among the miners&apos; leaders that they, the General Council leaders, are really intending to raise a serious struggle against the Conservatives on behalf of the U.S.S.R.   But this is, indeed, only a political[1 5653] c&apos;: Comintern &quot; Manifesto published in&quot; Izvestiya &quot; of June 26.
masquerade. The &quot;right&quot; leaders of the General Council, who at the moment hold the directing position in it (Thomas and Co.), deliberately desire to set the whole affair &quot;on new rails,&quot; are looking for &quot; a silken cord &quot; with which they may strangle the miners&apos; strike. And their idea evidently is that the part of this silken cord is to be played by a fictitious campaign in favour of the U.S.S.R. The so-called &quot; left&quot; leaders of the General Council are even now continuing to trail in the wake of the conscious betrayers of the strike.Whoever wishes to fight seriously against Birkenhead and Churchill must, above all else, render material help to the English miners&apos; strike. Otherwise all talk of a struggle against the Conservatives is a snare and a delusion.It is quite possible that the Conservatives, on the one side, and Thomas, MacDonald and Co., on the other, have again decided upon a simple division of labour. It is quite possible that the whole game is being played in accordance with a definite plan which has Baldwin&apos;s approval; Churchill, Birkenhead and Co. are to raise a shindy against the U.S.S.R. ; Thomas, MacDonald, Citrine and Co. are to pretend to come out in defence of the U.S.S.R. ; a &quot; united front &quot; will on this basis be proposed to the leaders of the coal-miners, and thus everything will be favourable for removing the question of material support to the miners from the order of the dayAs a result of the agreement between the bosses of the miners and the traitors and capitulators of the General Council, we have at the present moment the realisa-tion of the efforts of the right leaders of the Ceneral Council, who are deliberately preparing a united front of the leaders against the interests of the working miners.The course and conclusion of the great May strike showed that a united front of the present leaders of the English trades unions movement means that the workers will be sold to the bourgeoisie. An honest proletarian front of the worker masses must be set up against the tmjted front of the traitors, capitulators and wavering leaders.The coal-miners&apos; strike is threatened with danger. The main slogan of the moment is : &quot; Don&apos;t let the miners&apos; strike be smashed ! &quot; The present strike of the miners is not a &quot;usual,&quot; &quot;normal,&quot; &quot;purely economic&quot; strike. Its specific distinction lies in the fact that in May 1926 the coal-miners drew 4 million other workers into the struggle. The coal-miners&apos; strike has already led to the general strike which directly threatened the might of the English bourgeoisie. The economic significance of the coal conflict is now enormous. This strike is a trial of forces between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. This strike has enormous political significance for the working class of the whole world. Whoso wishes to help the English miners&apos; strike must not screen the crimes of the leaders of the General Council, but must appeal to the wide layers of the working masses and prepare an enlargement of the miners&apos; strike by attracting new companies of workers into the most immediate participation possible in the strike.We say to the English miners : &quot; A new treason is being committed ; the miners&apos; strike is in danger; repulse the waverers; organise a genuine, honest struggle of the working masses against the Conservatives, who are preparing a rupture of relations with theTJ.S.S.R.&quot;We say to the workers of the whole world: &quot;Hitherto your support of the English strike has been insufficient. From all sections of the Communist Inter-national the &apos; Comintern &apos; urgently demands that they apply their whole strength and their whole energy to the work of material aid to the English miners. It is necessary in one way or another to obtain, even though very small, yet regular contributions from all workers in aid of the English miners. It is necessary, in one way or another, to obtain the cessation of the export of coal to England. It is necessary to surround the English miners with an atmosphere of proletarian sympathy and support. The English workers and the workers of other countries must, above all things, recognise the bitter truth about the state of affairs in connection with the miners&apos; strike.&quot;To action ! Without losing a minute, let us set to and organise genuine support for the great struggle of the English miners.(Executive Committee of the Communist International.)

(In connection with the Discovery of thePlot to Murder Riza Khan.)(Translation.)&quot; THE suspiciously early and, as it seemed, unreserved recognition by England of the new regime in Persia by no means signified her unconditional concurrence with the new state of affairs. . . . The remarkably practical officials of the British Foreign Office recognised Riza Shah because he, with his national army, was the [15653] jjExtract from &quot; Izvestiya &quot; of October 2, 1926. British Plot in Tehran.(Translation.)THAT which was to be expected has apparently begun. In Western Persia new risings have started, and in Tehran a&apos; plot against the life of the Shah has been discovered. The western provinces of Persia on the Mesopotamian border have for some time past been a favourite place for the political experiments of English agents among nomad and semi-settled tribes. If the hand of England in that case has not yet been revealed, it has been, clearly denoted in the Tehran plot organised, as it seems, by a number of English hirelings of long standing. Among them stand out Serkeshik-Zade and Khaim, who have long been known among Tehran journalists for their zeal on behalf of the English Legation.An extremely interesting situation has arisen. Biza Shah mounted the throne with the favourable participation of the British, who hoped by this manoeuvre to attract him away from co-operation with the Soviet Union and counted upon our republican convictions to embroil him in trouble with us. The tone of the English press, which had been for years past distinguished by its hostility towards Riza, suddenly changed to a laudatory one, and the King of England himself was the first to congratulate Riza by telegram on his accession.We looked upon these intrigues with complete tranquillity. Taking as our guide in our State policy the principle of non-intervention in other people&apos;s affairs, and maintaining the most correct and at times even friendly relations with bourgeois States of the most divergent political structures, we continued to regard the new monarch of Persia as a man who objectively, both by his own nature and by the nature of his historical entourage, will in the future fulfil a historic mission in creating a strong Persian State system by centralising the State apparatus and doing away with the remnants of feudal structure, thus preparing the ground for the economic revival of the country and the prosperity of its bourgeoisie and its antipodes the proletariat.We were not deceived in our previsions. The British, too, became convinced of their mistake, and in accordance with their old practice, began to have recourse to the means of action beloved of them in the East, namely, to undermining State authority and State finances by border risings and plots against the person in power in the centre. The masks have fallen, and Riza Shah sees once more the face which was well known to him before, and which, it seems, that for one moment he had begun to forget.It is interesting to observe one peculiarity : The conspirators, it seems, wished to drag into their plot local Socialist leaders, among them the notorious Sulieman Mirza. They even applied to our legation with the suggestion that it should take part in the overthrow of the &quot;tyranny&quot; of the new Shah. To this stupid and vulgar attempt at provocation they received a worthy answer. Now, with their customary impudence, English agents in Persia are endeavouring to circulate the version that the conspirators were in the service of the &quot; Bolsheviks.&quot; Even the water-carriers do not believe it, inasmuch as everybody knows what sort of people Serkeshik-Zade and his warm company are.
only power in the country.&quot; English diplomacy set itself the task of impressing the new dynasty by its extreme friendliness and so winning its confidence and rendering it subservient to its ends. . . . But Riza Shah, whilst preserving normal relations with England, refused to be her puppet, and such is the character of the Imperialist interests of great Powers that they are ever in jeopardy when an Eastexm nation adopts an independent national line in its foreign policy. Thus the Turco-Persian Pact of the 22nd April dealt a severe blow7 to English Imperialism in the Near East, for it was the latter&apos;s object to maintain tlie antagonism between Persia and Turkey, using as a weapon the Kurdish tribes in the frontier districts of Persia, Turkey and Iraq. England also strove to embitter relations between Persia and the U.S.S.R. and between Persia and Afghanistan. The agreement between Persia and Turkey to take joint action for the liquidation of Kurdish insurrections was not in the interests of British policy, for it disposed of the &quot; Kurdish problem &quot; which England assiduously cultivated. An analogous agreement between Persia and Afghanistan would confront England with the unpleasant perspective of a series of States joined by non-aggression pacts extending from the Mediterranean to India. So English policy in Persia did a volte-face and English agents provoked the rising in Persian Kurdistan under Salar-ed-Dowleh. The plan was drawn up in Bagdad, where Salar-ed-Dowleh had lately been residing. He has English advisers on his staff, English and Anglo-Indian officers are employed in his forces, and his men are armed with English rifles and machine guns. The insurgents, abundantly financed as they are, have lately captured the districts of Maku and Urumia. Another rebellion has taken place in Persian Baluchistan with Duzdak as a centre. Thus the districts adjacent on the one side to British Iraq and on the other to Indian Baluchistan are in open rebellion. &quot; But it is evident that the interests of the English in Persia are too closely affected and their stake too great for them to confine themselves to mere rebellions. ... It was evidently decided to get rid of Riza Shah. A few days ago telegrams were received of the discovery in Persia of a big plot against Riza Shah. Many prominent Anglophiles had been arrested. The threads of the plot lead to the English Legation. The mere fact of the plot and the co-ordination of frontier risings with the coup d&apos;Etat at the Court demon-strate that English imperialism has entered a cut de sac. It is haig nowadays to suppose that by the removal of Mustafa Kemal in Turkey, of Riza Shah in Persia and of Ibn Saud in Arabia the profound processes evolving in the East can be arrested or directed into a different channel. We are confident that the Persian people, regardless of any Imperialist &apos; interests,&apos; will confirm their right to an independent existence.&quot;(12.)Translation of Leading Article from &quot; Izvestiya&quot; of December 29, 1920.The Provocation I^ails.A NUMBER of objective data bears witness to the increase of reactionary pressure on the Soviet Onion. First among such data are Fascist plots organised by the international bourgeoisie under London&apos;s leadership in a number of countries. It is certainly not by chance that the organisers of Fascist risings choose for their experiments those points which they consider most suitable politically and strategically for intervention. This preliminary allocation of forces for developing attack operations against the Soviet Union is admitted even in the bourgeois press. In particular, there can be no doubt as to the aim of the impressarios wdio have staged the Fascist rising in Lithuania, however much they may have camouflaged their designs and whatever declarations the repre-sentatives of the new regime have made.
Fascist risings and-preparations for such are not, however, the only form of organising attacks on the U.S.S.R. Equally symptomatic is the &quot; new course &quot; now adopted by European social democracy, which is endeavouring to isolate the U.S.S.R. This course, as a matter of fact, can only be called new in the sense that it translates the secret designs of the Social Democrats into -open action. German social democracy took up a position of open hostility to the proletarian revolution, and consequently to the Soviet Union as soon as it got a whiff of participation in government. The Schiedemannists, however, have never yet come out with such an open gospel of rupture and preparation- of public opinion for hostile action against the U.S.S.R. as now. Need one add that the military ardour which has now seized on the Sonial Democrat leaders is not the result of some miraculous immaculate conception, but of direct orders from London, reinforced by corresponding arguments of a sufficiently worldly character.They do say that Schiedemann&apos;s utterances in the Reichstag scandalous and despicable, even for Social Democrats with their senselessly libellous attacks on the U.S.S.R., were preceded by keen debates which very nearly led to a split in the Social Democrat parliamentary fraction. It would, of course, be unpardonable naivete to believe this. The whole Social Democrat campaign, at present directed to forcing a way into a Coalition Government on the platform of a rupture with the U.S.S.R., is being played to music sent from London, each performer fulfilling the precise role prescribed for him.When the Schiedemannists, while introducing a vote of lack of confidence in the Marks Government, at the same time declare emphatically that the vote does not apply to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stresemann, whose Geneva policy is affirmed to be above all praise, they are only fulfilling the role allotted to them by those who manoeuvre behind the scenes of the League of Nations. When, on the other hand, the initiators of the Western orientation of the German Government hasten with speedy magnanimity to forgive the Social Democrats their &quot; attempts for the country&apos;s armed forces,&quot; they in their turn are not moved thereto by their own reasoning, but by considerations which originated in London. The peculiar quality of the role which the Social Democrats are playing consists in their being given the dirtiest of libellous work.The international bourgeoisie is perfectly well aware that the main obstacle to military intervention is the growing sympathy of the wide masses towards the Soviet Union. There can be no question of successful interventionist plans if international reaction does not succeed in stifling this sympathy, be it only for the short interval necessary to confront the people with the fait accompli of a military attack.The mission laid upon the leaders by the bourgeoisie consists in upsetting by a sudden trick that part of the workers which is not yet free from the influence of reformism. The last campaign of German social democracy is a dress-rehearsal of such a bamboozling the workers with fairy stories about &quot; secret designs &quot; of the Soviet Government.Those who &quot;reveal&quot; them know that they will be caught flagrante delicto, that the falsity of their documents will be proven, that they will be shown up. But they are not counting on a success of a more or less considerable duration. It is enough for their provocatory designs if they succeed in snatching the moment, stupefying the masses, paralysing their will, and thus giving the military a free hand.In order to give a clear definition of all the reactionary forces which have taken part in the last anti-Soviet campaign one must mention the action of the so-called ultra-Lefts. The speech of Schwarz, the man who has been excluded from the Communist party, and who calls himself a &quot;wild Communist,&quot; is a repetition of Scheidemann&apos;s provocatory lie worked up to the very height of impudent absurdity.Never before has the German worker had so clearly before him the fact that the opportunist Scheidemann and the ultra-Left Schwarz are both of them equally the agents of English Imperialism and play the role of provocateurs among the working class. Schwarz, as is known, crowns that opposition which finds its classical expression in Germany in the expelled members of the Communist party, Ruth Fischer and Maslov. We never doubted but that this opposition, beginning with iff criticism of &quot; Soviet policy,&quot; must inevitably sink to an undisguised counter ievolutionary alliance with the Churchills and Birkenhcad. But we could scarcely foresee that this would take place so quickly, that on the very first
mobilisation of reactionary forces the &quot; wild Communist &quot; Schwarz would be one of the chief snipers.The ultra-Lefts had sunk to the depths even before they flaunted their peacock tail of spurious revolutionism. So much the better-so much Jihe sooner have they revealed themselves.The counter-revolutionary rehearsal in Germany is not yet ended. The anti-. Soviet campaign of the Social Democrats is still in full flare. But its results-have&apos; already become clearly enough defined. It has failed to bamboozle the working masses.   The deceit was ineffective.   The provocation fails.o
