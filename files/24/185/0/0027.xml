Jt. &apos; jz.*?v- W -V? rjp(A.) Draft Convention for the Limitation of Naval, Military and Air Armaments.(C.I.D. Paper No. 776-B.)[Previous Reference: C.I.D. Minutes of the 218th Meeting, Minute 19.]LORD CECIL stated that this draft Convention had been discussed by the xepresentatives of the Departments concerned. The object was to put forward a skeleton of a Convention which would become effective if and when agreements were reached in regard to the figures to be inserted in it. The general conception on which the Convention was based was: in regard to naval and air armaments limitation was imposed on material and not on effectives; in regard to land armaments limitation was imposed on effectives and not on material. He considered that it was desirable, especially in regard to land armaments, that some indication should be obtained of the measures adopted by foreign Powers for the purpose of securing an increase in their &quot;fighting strength&quot;. This indication could only be obtained by refer-ence to budgetary expenditure on armaments. The object of including this reference to expenditure was not in order to compare State A&apos;s expenditure with that of State B, but in order to compare the expenditure of State A in successive years. The only point in the draft Convention on which agreement had not been reached by his Sub-Committee was contained in the second paragraph of Article 3. The provision in this paragraph only required notice to be given of an increase in expenditure. In effect, no further information would be required than that which was already published in the Service Estimates, where any increase in expenditure was of course explained by means of a note. With regard to land armaments a further provision had been introduced in Article 7 with regard to aggregate expenditure. This provision had been suggested by the War Office representative himself.[15872] b
Mr. bridgeman said that he understood that the effect of Article3, paragraph 2, was limited to a notification of the figures included in the Service Estimates. This information was of course available to the public at the pre cut time, but the mere fact of forwarding this information officially to the League, of Nations might result in questions being raised, to answer which might not be in our interests. If we refused to give the additional explanations asked, it would give rise to suspicion. At the same time it was not possible For us to accept a situation whereby we would be constantly exposed to cross-examination.LORD CECIL explained that the provisions of the Article would be applicable to all the High Contracting Powers, and it might be of importance to us to be able to call attention to violent changes in the armaments of other countries.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that he realised the importance of the point which Lord Cecil had just made, and that, if all the parties to the draft Convention were reasonable, we might thereby secure information which was not at present available. At the same time he felt that, although the object of the information was not to compare the expenditure of State A with State B, nevertheless, comparisons based on the figures supplied would, in fact, be drawn between different States. In these circumstances we should suffer since, owing to our voluntary system, the cost of our Fighting Services was disproportionately higher than that of Continental nations. In regard to Air Armaments in particular, it would be possible to draw a very damaging picture if our expenditure was compared with that of France. There was a second objection also to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 3, namely, that with a technical Service expenditure on material was never constant, and was liable to considerable fluctuations. For example, in the scheme for the expansion of the Air Force expenditure for a period of two or three years was mainly devoted to the erection of buildings and the acquisition of aerodromes, but after this period equipment figured as the main item of expenditure. It would be inconvenient if, in such circumstances, a country was pressed to give information in regard to the kind of equipment which it was adopting.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he disliked the provision contained in the second paragraph of Article 3, since we were the only country which was liable to shift the centre of its military gravity from one area to another. Such changes were difficult to explain to an International body such as the League of Nations. He thought it was essential that we should maintain our freedom in this respect. Had this Convention been in force at the time we should presumably have had to furnish explanations regarding the fortifications of the Singapore Base.LORD CECIL replied that explanations in regard to the Singapore Base had already been given in the Estimates. He pointed out that, if there was to be any attempt at limitations of armaments, there was always tlie possibility of being-subjected to requests for explanations. The point was that we, in effect, did publish all necessary information to our own Parliament, whereas other countries did not do so. He suggested that it would be an advantage for us to try and make other countries adopt the same kind of publicity as we did.LORD SALISBURY stated that there was no intention in the Convention of giving any more information than was at the present time given to the House of Commons. He did not believe that any attempt at coercive control in regard to armaments was possible, and he was very doubtful of the wisdom of Article 7 of the Draft Convention. He thought, however, that there was no disadvantage in trying to get other countries to follow our example in regard to the publication of information.SIR LAMING WORTHING TON-EVANS pointed out that the Convention contemplated giving to the League of Nations the same information as was at present given to the House of Commons. The House of Commons had every right to cross examine. Was this same right going to be given to the League of Nations ? The House of Commons was not wilfully unpatriotic, whereas the League of Nations Avas an International body.LORD CECIL pointed out that the other Powers represented at Geneva were anxious that some statement of expenditure should be provided for in the Convention and we should certainly be pressed to agree to such a provision. It would be almost impossible for the British Representative to adopt the attitude that his country refused to give to the League of Nations the information which it already gave to its own Parliament.
Mr. AMERY enquired whether the information would merely be forwarded to the Secretariat of the League or whether there would be any right to subject this information to cross-examination in the same way as was done by the Mandates Commission.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that he saw a difference between presenting information to the House of Commons, which thus became available to the League of Nations, and forwarding information officially to the League of Nations. Undoubtedly our Estimates contained more information than those of other Powers. He suggested, therefore, that the British Representative might be authorised to agree to a statement of information, provided that other Powers agreed to give similar information. But the British Representative should be instructed to resist any attempt to create a permanent body at Geneva for the purpose of examining, analysing and reporting on this information. There was a movement to create a sort of General Staff under the auspices of the League. This movement we had openly resisted in the past, and we should continue to do so in the future.SIR MAURICE ITANKEY reminded the Committee of Imperial Defence that one of the reasons that had led the Committee to recommend the rejection of the Geneva Protocol (notwithstanding that Representatives of the late Government had taken an important part in drawing it up at Geneva) had been &quot; its provisionvfor working out plans for economic coercion and for ascertaining ih advance the amount of force to be placed at the disposal of the League&quot; for sanctions (C.I.D. Paper 559-B, paragraph 109 (1)). The Committee of Imperial Defence had seen ih these provisions (Articles 12 and 13 of the Geneva Protocol) a furtherance of the scheme, desired by the French Government ever since the Peace Conference, for a League General Staff to draw up plans for its forces (ibid., paragraph 58), a scheme which the British Government had always opposed. If the Committee of Imperial Defence still held this view, they ought to be on their guard against any step which might lead by successive stages to the same end first, the sending of information on armament expenditure to the League; then a demand for a Commission to examine and report on the information, and, finally, for its development into something resembling a General Staff.LORD BEATTY pointed out that paragraph 2 of Article 3 provided for a statement of expenditure on Naval Armaments. A difficulty arose in this connec-tion, viz., that, though the Navy was one Imperial unit, the expenditure on the Navy was in part borne by the Governments of the various Dominions.SIR SAMUEL HOARE expressed the view that, whatever reservations we might make, there would always be a dangerous tendency for a Commission, analogous to the Mandates Commission, to be set up at Geneva to examine the statement of expenditure.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Committee of Imperial Defence had agreed at its 138th meeting, held on the 12th May, 1921, &quot;that the informa-tion as to scales of armaments and programmes of construction to be given to the League of Nations should be the same as is given to Parliament (viz., estimates and returns laid on the Table), and that, so long as some of the principal Naval and Military Powers remain outside the League of Nations, the difficulties of giving more information than this are manifest.&quot; He felt convinced that paragraph 2 of Article 3 should be struck out of the draft Treaty.LORD CECIL asked that he should be allowed a certain amount of liberty on this point. It was not true to say that other Powers broke their agreements without concern. What the Representatives of these Powers stated quite openly was that they were only bound by the exact terms of the Agreement which they had accepted, and that they did not understand such phrases as &quot; the intention of the Treaty &quot; or the &quot; spirit of the Treaty.&quot; He still thought that the provisions contained in para-graph 2 of Article 3 were desirable, especially with regard to foreign countries, as it would force them to show what steps they were taking in regard to armaments, and would thus give the opposition parties in these countries an opportunity of keeping their Governments to their pledges.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that so long as coercive measures were in force his experience had been that the Opposition Parties remained silent. For example, so long as the Inter-Allied Commission of Control was in Berlin the Opposition in Germany had been silent in regard to military matters, but once the[1587-2] b 2
Control Commission had been removed, the Opposition shewed itself keen to ensure that the Reichswehr was not allowed to exceed its proper limitations, and, for the first time, an open Inquiry was conducted into scandals in connection with the Reichswehr. He thought, therefore, that paragraph 2 of Article 3 could be dropped as the first paragraph of that Article gave all the powers that were necessary.LORD BEATTY drew attention to the wording of Articles 2, 3 and 4, which contained such phrases as &quot; with the concurrence of the Council of the League of Nations,&quot; &quot; communicate to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.&quot; He suggested that these references to the League of Nations might be changed to High Contracting Parties, since the United States of America might object to them.LORD CECIL suggested that, if the Americans raised any objection, suitable alterations in wording could be effected later on.SIR LAMING- WORTHINGTON-EVANS drew attention to Article 7, which provided for a limitation of the aggregate expenditure on land armaments. He suggested that the tendency would be to put the figure so high as to defeat the object of this provision.LORD CECIL pointed out that this Article had been included on the suggestion of the representative of the War Office oh his Committee. He did not attach any great importance to it and was quite willing for the Article to be deleted.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS pointed out that if Article 7 was deleted a consequential alteration would have to be made in Article 13, involving the deletion of the words &quot; or is incurring expenditure on land armaments in excess of the figures set out in Table 1 of Annex I.&quot;Mr. BRIDGEMAN suggested that the words &quot; at once &quot; in the sixth line of Article 13 should be deleted, and enquired whether the provision at the end of the second paragraph of Article 13, namely, &apos;*&apos; that it will join in such action as may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations,&quot; required a unanimous decision before being put into effect.LORD CECIL pointed out that we were bound to take action of this kind under Article 11 of the Covenant, whereas the United States of America was not so bound. If this provision remained in the Convention the United States would also be under-taking the obligations which already rested on us. He was of opinion that unanimity was implied in the wording of the Convention.Conclusion. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed To.approve the draft Convention for the limitation of Naval, Military and Air Armaments (C.I.D. Paper No. 776-B) as the basis for the instructions of the British representatives at the forthcoming meetings of &quot;the Preparatory Commis-sion at Geneva, subject to the following amendments: (a.) Paragraph 3 (2) to be omitted. (&amp;.) Paragraph 7 to be excluded.(c.) Paragraph 13, lines 4 and 5, omit the words &quot; or his incurring expenditure on land armaments in excess of the figures set out in Table 1 of Annex 1.&quot; (d.) Paragraph 13, line 6, omit the words &quot; at once &quot;;and subject to the understanding that the British delegates will oppose any proposal for the creation of a special League Commission or Staff for the purpose of examining, analysing or reporting on the information to be furnished under the provisions of the Draft Convention.3J  sfe ijjs $fc

A warship of greater displacement than tons ( metric tons), whichmounted a gun of larger calibre than inches ( millimetres) and which possessed a deck on which aircraft could land and from which aircraft could fly off would be classified as a Battleship or Battle Cruiser. If the largest gun mounted in such a warship was of inch calibre the ship would still be classified as a Battleship or Battle Cruiser if its displacement exceeded tons ( metric tons);  but if the displacement was, tons( metric tons) or less this ship would beclsssified as an aircraft carrier.Or again.
