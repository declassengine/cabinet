J(This dppiopsnfr is  he property pf His, Britannic Majesty!s Goygrpmen^.^CABINET.SECRET. _c.p.5?(87). GENERAL GRAKT SCHEME.Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.When the consideration of the proposed General Block Grant Scheme is resumed, I shall have to raise the question of leaving the police grants outside the scope of the scheme, and I accordingly circulate this note of my views.The proposal to supersede the present expenditure grants by a unified grant based on general characteristics is advocated, as I understand, mainly on the grounds -(l) That it is desirable, in the interests of local government, to confer on the local authorities a much greater measure of freedom from Whitehall control.   As it is put, for instance, in the Barstow Committee&apos;s Report (Second Report, para. 26) &quot;Some of us believe that ..... only by placing the Government subventions to local authorities on a basis entirely independent of the details and results of local administration, can local government realise the full measure of its usefulness&quot;.(2) That expenditure grants tend to extravagance in local expenditure, because the local funds bear only a portion (usually half) of the burden of any new expenditure.I propose briefly to examine these propositions in relation to the police.    The first of them, I presume, is the central consideration on which the proposed scheme is based, and my main point with regard to it is that it is almost wholly inapplicable to the Police Service in its present stage of development.    The Police Service retains in form its local character but in some of ^ its most important aspects is now wholly or predominantly national. I would point in particular to the following features -
(l) The Metropolitan Police, comprising more than cne-third of the police of England and Wales, is wholly under central control, the local authorities having no part in its administration nor any control over expenditure.(2) The conditions of service of all ranks in all forces, Metropolitan, County and Borough, are fixed on a national basis, and I could not assent to a departure from present principles in this regard.(3) The strengths of the various forces are fixed partly on local and partly on national conciderations, but the Home Office is the predominant partner in the  settlement of questions of strength.    The local authorities may propose any change but I hold the power of veto, and I can require a force to be increased if necessary to maintain efficiency.(4) The measures for the detection of crime and the arrest of criminals are developed in part on a national basis, and it is clear that in coming years further important advances, in which the Home Office must take part, must be made in this direction.    I may mention, for Instance, the further application to police purposes of wireless telegraphy and telephony, the development of motor transport in police use, the improvement of specialist detective and other police training, etc. etc.(5) Even the control of the personnel of the local forces must be assumed to some extent by the central authority in an emergency.    Thus I took power by the Emergency Regulations of last year to transfer a portion of any force to another police district or to take it for any particular duty elsewhere;    and in any case of local emergency I am always able, under arrangements which are well recognised though without statutory authority, to arrange for the transfer of men to any other force that is in need of aid.Generally it may be said that under present conditions the Government have gained many of the advantages of a national police
system without its disadvantages, and no one, I think, would seriously suggest a reversal of policy in this regard.    I, at anyrato, could not he a party to any step in that direction. Whatever may he possible in the other services, the police is certainly not one in which the Government can be content with securing a minimum standard of efficiency and, apart from that, wash their hands of local administration.    I suggest therefore that the inclusion of the police under any General Grant Scheme such as is now proposed would be out of keeping with the main purpose of the scheme and would have several practical disadvantages.In the first place, in the initial negotiations with the local authorities, the denial of that freedom of local action which the local authorities will have been led to expect from the scheme would be likely to be exploited as a basis for attack on the scheme as a whole, notwithstanding the relatively sme.ll amount of the police subventions:    and in the subsequent administration I foresee grave difficulties, to which attention has already been drawn in the note appended by the Home Office representatives to the Barstow Committee&apos;s Third Report.Another point which seems to me to call for further consideration is the special position of London, which the Barstow Committee have found so difficult.    As the Committee point out, the proposed scheme, applied as it stands to London, leaves London County in very heavy deficiency as compared with tho grants received under the existing system.    This appears to arise from the high level of expenditure in the services attracting grant,, particularly in the case of the Metropolitan Police, coupled with high assessable value in proportion to population, and I gather from the figures which the Committee give that the exclusion of the police from the scheme would at once reduce the formula deficiency for London County from 8/- to only 4/l or thereabouts,   (and, incidentally, would convert the Middlesex deficiency of -/(? to a gain of -/ll) though it would no doubt
create deficiencies in other areas, particularly the Counties where police costs per head are generally below the average. -I notice that the Barstow Committee in their endeavour to find a solution of the London problem have taken advantage of the special position of the Metropolitan Police to suggest a method of adjustment, but, however well their proposal may look on paper, it is in reality a purely arbitrary measure, and I doubt whether it would be more acceptable to the local authorities than the distribution of a similar sum of money on a frankly arbitrary basis.Turning to the second set of considerations advanced in favour of a General Block Grant, that of its relation to expenditure, these, too, have little relevancy to a Tervice where so large a proportion of the total expenditure is at all times urtder direct central control and where there is so little inducement to a local authority to be extravagant:    and in a Service like the police, where the central authority has so direct a concern in the development of the local services in the interests of national rather than local efficiency, a grant coupled with and directly dependent on expenditure and efficiency has definite advantages of its own.    Without it, for instance, I should expect to encounter much greater difficulty in introducing improvements of method or organisation which are desirable in the general interest, especially if they promise no immediate local advantage.It is true, of course, that an expenditure grant system tends to stimulate .local expenditure in so far as that may rest with the local authorities, but in the case of the police, the amount of the looal authorities&apos; expenditure which is susceptible to stimulus of this kind is, as already explained, very limited indeed:    and the amount of grant in respect thereof is at anyrate limited by the expenditure which is approved.    On the other hand, I note that in connection with the General Grant Scheme which the Barstow Committee have
propounded it is proposed to distribute, on the initiation of the scheme, additional sums reaching nearly the amount of the grant for police, and the Committee do not suggest how .it is possible to provide any safeguard against even this vast sum being further increased under pressure from the local authorities for still more Exchequer relief from the burden on the rates as the cost of existing local services increases or new services are undertaken or thrust upon them.The scheme, of course, has attractive features and promises some advantages even from the Home Office point of view if it could be applied to the police;    but in view of the objections and difficulties which I have mentioned, I think it application to that Service would be a grave blunder.W.J.H.16th February, 1927.
