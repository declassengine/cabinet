Papers Nos. 734-B, 752-B, 760-B, 761-B, paragraph 10, and 764-B,paragraphs 8 and 14.)(Previous References : C.I.D. Minutes of the 217th Meeting, Minute 3, and 218th Meeting, Minute 7 (ii).)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the following Papers relating to the policy to be adopted in regard to Chemical Warfare :-(i.) Activities in Soviet Russia.Memorandum   by the   Secretary   of   State  for  War  (G.I.D.  Paper No. 734-B).(ii.) Use of Gas in Native Rebellions.Letter from the Dominions Office covering correspondence with the officers administering the Government of Southern Rhodesia (C.I.D. Paper No. 752-B).(iii.) Use of Tear Gas in China.(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 760-B, 761-B and 764 B.)SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN stated that he httd already circulated to the Committee a Paper outlining theTnternational condemnations of Gas Warfare, and the occasions on which we had charged gas as a special crime against Germany (C.I.D. Paper No. 732-B). Having regard to the nature and number of our international pledges and published pronouncements on this subject, he was most anxious that we should not hastily commit ourselves to any policy with a view to justifying the use of gas in the future. He had concurred with the precautionary measures, which had been proposed in this connection in regard to China, but he would be very reluctant to concur in the use of gas except in reply to attack by gas.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON EVANS stated that his Memorandum on the subject (C.I.D. Paper No. 754-B) called attention to the preparations which were being made in Soviet Russia for the production of war gases.    Though [15823-2]
Russia&apos;s capacity for the production of gas was not yet in full operation, nevertheless, she was in a position to produce something like 1,000 tons of gas a month, which was equivalent to our estimated total output during the first six months of a war. Further, the Russians had at Tashkent a Gas School where German instructors were employed, and where 150 men were at present under training. It was apparent, therefore, that not only was Russia making preparations for the production of gas but was also training her soldiers in the use of gas for warlike purposes. He outlined the arrangements which had been made in accordance with the Cabinet Conclusions to consider the possible use of gas in China.With regard to the despatch from the Governor of Southern Rhodesia, he pointed out that in the past natives had been expelled from caves by means of dynamite. In these circumstances the use of tear gas was at once both more effective and more humane. Generally the use of tear gas might be defended on account of its comparatively innocuous character. In fact, the Americans had already used it to disperse crowds during industrial upheavals. Two questions arose for immediate consideration (a) what policy was to be adopted in regard to the use of gas by the Shanghai Defence Force; and (&amp;) what answer should be given to the despatch from the Governor of Southern Rhodesia.Mr. AMERY considered that the case in favour of the use of innocuous gases in Southern Rhodesia was overwhelming. In the past wars with natives in South Africa had been marked by unpleasant incidents, where native men and women, who had taken shelter in caves, had been subjected to-starvation and been expelled by means of smoke and dynamite. In comparison with this treatment the use of tear gas was humane. He did not consider that there was any real objection to gas of a comparatively innocuous character being held in readiness in Southern Rhodesia against possible eventualities. At the present time there did not appear to be any likelihood of trouble in that quarter, as the native population showed no signs of unrest.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS said he was in favour of making a public announcement to the effect that we had found that our policy in prohibiting the use of gas was a mistake, and that we wished to be released from our pledges in this connection.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN remarked that if we were prepared to accept that our publicly declared policy in regard to gas warfare was wrongly conceived; chat by adhering to that policy we would be in fact refusing to use a more humane weapon of warfare ; and that the use of gas would result in less loss of life, it might be possible for us to approach the world with a considered statement explaining the reasons for the change in policy which was now suggested. But in the absence of such a public explanation he strongly deprecated the use of gas in any circumstances. It would be impossible to make use of gas and then subsequently to launch, our plea for justification. We could, however, issue a statement giving our reasons for advocating the use of gas in future. We could, in such a statement, cite the use by the Americans and the French of innocuous gases at times of civil unrest, and we could call attention to the manufacture of lethal gases on a large scale by the Soviet Government. We could further draw attention to the Resolution in regard to gas in the American Senate. To adopt such a course would be to follow out a definite policy which could be defended. To use gas first and then to issue a statement would be indefensible, as this statement would only be regarded as an attempt to excuse wrong doing. He personally thought that, if the use of gas was made permissible, this use would not be confined to innocent gases, and that gas warfare in practice would not prove more humane, but would be accompanied by greater horrors than the present methods of waging war.LORD BALFOUR suggested that attention might be drawn in the House of Commons to the rumours which were curx-ent with regard to the preparations made by Russia for the production of poison gases, and that a question might be posed as to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this connection. The answer to such a question might be to the effect that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government was a party to agreements prohibiting the use of gases, such prohibition was in fact not practicable until the agreements had been universally adopted.   It was not possible for a nation or a group oi nations to observe the
Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a.) To take note of the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War regarding the activities of Soviet Russia in the production of war gas.provisions of any such agreement, when gas was being prepared in large quantities in close proximity to their frontiers. In addition, reference might be made to the use of gas by the Americans at times of civil unrest, and to the Resolution in the American Senate in regard to poison gas.SIR SAMUEL FfOARE suggested that the present was not an appropriate time to raise this question, having regard to the attitude of Labour in this country and to the imminence of the Geneva Conference on Reduction and Limitation of Armaments.Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL expressed the opinion that, in the present circumstances, it would probably be necessary to continue our defensive measures and to refrain from adopting publicly a,,policy in favour of gas warfare.THE PRIME MINISTER considered that it would be a wise course to draw attention publicly to the preparations which were being made by Soviet Russia. He did not, however, welcome the suggestion of advocating the use of gas at the present time. In regard to China, he felt that it would be wiser to refrain from using gas until it had been used by some other Power first.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS pointed out that any reference in Parliament to Russia&apos;s preparations would be accompanied by a request for information as to the steps which we were taking to counter these preparations.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN observed that we would be fully justified in stating that we must take measures to defend ourselves adequately against the preparations made by Russia.LORD BALFOUR read to the Committee a telegram which he had sent to Mr. Lloyd George at the time of the Washington Conference, in regard to Mr. Roofs Resolution, viz.: &quot;Americans have just sprung on Conference Resolution condemning the use of gas. It will probably be discussed at to-morrow&apos;s meeting. It was my hope that neither this nor other subsidiary questions would be seriously considered by this Conference, but American procedure (which I suspect to have been rather hastily adopted) renders immediate action inevitable on the part of British Delegation.&quot; On technical side I hold it to be proved &quot; (1.) That no international ruling can prevent plant being erected for purposes of. peaceful industry which could be used almost without change for manufacture of poison gas.&quot; (2.) That nothing can stop discovery of new gases.&quot; (3.) That no country can allow its safety to be wholly dependent on faithful observance by other States of rules to which they are pledged.&quot; (4.) That we shall, therefore, have to take precisely the same precautionary measures whether Conference condemns gas warfare or whether it does not.&quot;He suggested that the position now was precisely the same as at the time when he sent this telegram.THE PRIME MINISTER proposed that the attention of the Cabinet should be drawn to the general question of the policy to be adopted in regard to chemical warfare; that the Secretary should be instructed to bring the Resolution in the American Senate to the notice of the Cabinet when this matter came up for consideration; that in the meantime the reply to the Governor of Southern Rhodesia should be delayed, and that we should not make use of gas in China unless some other Power had made use of it in the first instance.
2. Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, February 25, 1927.o(6.) To recommend that the attention of the public should be drawn to these activities on the part of Soviet Russia by means of suitable action in Parliament.(c.) To recommend that the question of the general policy to be adopted in regard to Chemical Warfare should be referred to the Cabinet.(d.) To instruct the Secretary to bring to the notice of the Cabinet, when this question Of general policy is under consideration, the Resolution in the American Senate in regard to the poison gas treaty.(e.) To recommend that, pending the decision of the Cabinet on the general question of policy referred to in (a) above* the reply to the despatch of the Governor of Southern Rhodesia regarding the use of gas in native rebellions should be withheld.(/.) To reaffirm that gas was not to be employed in China without express authority from home.***** *
N0..1977.BRITISH EMBASSY,&quot; A Sli I i-TGT ON,  D-.CDecember 17th, 1926.Sir,With reference  to my despatch No. 1830 of the 23rd ultimo,  I have the honour to report that the Geneva protocol for the prohibition of poison gas in warfare was debated in the Senate on the 13th instant,  and on the motion of Senator -Borah referred back without roll-call to the Committee on Foreign Relations,2,      Senator Borah made no explanation of his move which it is generally believed will result in the. protocol becoming shelved in Committee,  although its proponents insist that recommittal was merely in the nature of a strategic retreat designed to afford the opportunity of further consideration.3.      The  &quot;New York Times&quot;  of the 14th instant,  publishes the text  of an open letter from Congressman Fish deploring the decision of the American Legion at  their Annual Convention to oppose the passage of the Protocol,  and declaring that,  in his opinion,  &quot;the United States cannot with self respect refuse to c-$-operate with other civilised nations to dels troy this Frankenstein and align ourselves with other great nations striving to protect modem civilisation.&quot;    On the other hand,  Senator Ransdell of Louisiana, during the course of the above mentioned Senate Debate,  voiced the views of those opposed to this measure, arguing that the  development of poison gas was the surest means of deterring nations from embarking on the horrors of modernwarfare./The Rt. IIon. Sir Austen Chamberlain,  k.q., I.P.,etc. etc. etc.
warfare.,    He also annexed to his remarks correspondencerelating to the protocol recentl?/- exchanged between theSecretary of State and J.ir* Charles L,  Parsons:, Secretary ofthe American Chemical Society,,    In concluding his observations,to the Secretary of State on this subject,  Mr.,  Parsons wroteas follows :&quot;I am particularly gratified to note your statement that  !all governments recognise that it is incumbent upon them to be fully prepared as regards chemical warfare and especial^/- as regards defence against it,  irrespective of any partial or general international agreements looking to the prohibition wf the actual use of such warfare,    The purpose of all international efforts that have been made to control this weapon is, according to my understanding, to prohibit its use.    I have never seen any proposal seriously advanced by any government to provide that national preparation for the use of and tax  defence against chemical warfare,  if such warfare should be used by an enemy contrary to treaty engagements,   should be abolished or curtailed in the slightest&apos;.&quot;&quot;I must continue to maintain, however,  contrary to 7/cur view,  that the only logical course for the United States to pursue,  should It agree to the prohibition of the use of gas in warfare, is  to itself consent to the same supervision and cortrol of the chemical industry of this country through international boards which France and the League of Nations are quite right in maintaining is the only possible way to police the situation.    It is my personal opinion that even such supervision would be entirely ineffective and that there is no possible way to inhibit the use of asphyxiating gases in warfare,,    As I believe  the United States will honourably keep any engagements entered into,  she will be particularly helpless, as few believe that such adherence to treaties will be universal.&quot;I have the honour to be,with the highest respect,&apos; Sir,Your most obedient humb1e servant,(Sgdv) S.G.  CHILTON.
