CABINET X&amp;Q18LATX0M COMMITTEE.Extension tc Railways of Section 4 of the Conspiracy ana Protection of Property Act, 187 5.(Note by the parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour).In behalf of the Minister of Labour,  I received on &quot;February   10th a deputation from the Railway Companies1 Association, which came to advocate the extension to Railway Companies of the provisions of Section 4 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act,  under which the employee of a gas or &quot;water undertaking who breaks a contract of service &quot;laiCKing . * . ,  0 o that the probable consequence of his so doing o. 0 o a *. will be to deprive the inhabitants . . n. . o    of their supply of gas or water&quot; shall,  on conviction by a court of summary jurisdiction be liable to a penalty of   0 or to 3 months3 imprisonment with or without hard labour. This provision was extended to electricity undertakings by the Act of 1919.The deputation, which spoke for all the Railway Companies, said that they did not regard their proposal as a matter of first importance, but that they thought it ought to be considered carefully in connection with any general revision of trade union law,      At j*resent their only legal remedy against a strike without notice is the power to sue an individual workman for any damages which they can show are causeci by his leaving wark without noticeo      This remedy js of little practical value.      It is often difficult or impossible to prove damages.     If the numbers of strikers are large,  it is impossible to proceed against them all and difficult to select individuals.
In the discussion it was pointed out that the agreement which the Companies made after the general strike with the unions,  in which the unions admit that they did wrong by striking without notice, and undertake not again to call or support a stride without notice, is of considerable moral value both nith the  employees and with the general public It is possible that if the Companies now adopt a new legal remedy in place  of this moral agreement,  the unions may take the line that the substitution of legal for moral sanctions is a ground for withdrawing from the agreement.      On the other hand, the Companies feel that the agreement binds only the union and its leaders, and the evil,  to deal with which they make their present proposal,  is the unauthorised strike by the rank and  file.      They think that the existence of the penalties, which woulc. be made known by notices, might act as a deterrent vna that the possession of the power to prosecute would be of some use as a bargaining counter..The experience of Ele ctric Power undertakings does not suggest that the clause is of very great value *      There&apos; have Seen no recent cases where either a municipal or a private-power un ertaking has either prosecuted or  even threatens d prosecution of individual strikers, and,  so far as is known, the power undertakings themselves do not regard the provision as of much effect,,      There  is an obvious objection to extending the statutory scope of a penal provision if it is not going to be used.Any proposal to apply Section 4 to railways would aat at once raise the  question of its application also to other forms of transport including the :iocks, and to other essential services such as food supply and manufacture.
The representatives of the railway companies stressed the point that they did not wish this question dealt with in isolation, and that they did not attach to it anything like the importance which they,attach to the proposals put forward by the Confederation of Employers; Associations for the amendment of the Trade Diaputes Act, lSD^o     They think, however, that if there is to he any comprehensive revision of trade union law it would, on the whole &quot;be to their advantage if their proposal could he adopted,(liltd. ) HoB-BoISth February, 1927.
