Copy No.      g&apos;QCABINET.CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE INDIAN FLIGHT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.MY colleagues may be interested to glance at the following notes upon certain points that have struck me during the course of the 12,000 miles flight that I have just completed. The press has given such prominence to the more picturesque incidents of my journey that I would on no account trouble the Cabinet with a number of details that, though interesting as news, have no political importance. Setting these aside, I may, however, claim that the flight has opened out certain wider aspects that are worth my colleagues&apos; attention.First, as to the flight itself. The significant point about it was not that we flew to India for several flights have already been made successfully between India and England but that we flew to India in an ordinary commercial machine upon a scheduled programme as definite as anything in Bradshaw or the time-tables of the Cunard and P. and O. I think that it was this fact that impressed the many countries through which we passed. It certainly surprised many of the officials who were deputed to meet us. More than once we arrived upon the very tick of the arranged time, to find the aerodrome empty and the official deputations not yet arrived. Day after day, in every kind of weather and climate, we completed our two stages of 300 or 400 miles each with clockwork-like precision, and we never, so far as I know, kept a single soul waiting upon any landing ground.I had always hoped that this almost meticulous punctuality would be the outstanding feat of the tour. When there is added to it the fact that neither the machine nor the three engines required a single spare part or repair during the whole of the journey, it cannot be denied that the flight was a conspicuous instance of the success of British air policy &quot;in labouring well the minute particulars&quot; and in concentrating our main civil development in the hands of a well-managed and responsible company such as Imperial Airways. Time after time the British representatives whom I met on the way told me that this regular maintenance of our time-table had made a deep impression upon public opinion.There is a second feature of the flight that should be mentioned. During the six weeks that I have been absent from England, I have been able to inspect the units of no less than four overseas Air Force commands, and to discuss upon the spot questions of the first importance to the development of British air power.Naturally, the more important of these discussions took place in India, where I spent three weeks. There, so it seemed to rne, my visit was of value in three different directions. In the first place, I was able to convince the Viceroy and his Council that the addition of two squadrons was essential to the defence of India. Secondly, I had the opportunity of seeing for myself the efficient and surprisingly successful work of the existing squadrons in the difficult conditions of the frontier, and of discussing with the commander-in-Chief and others the question of the part that air force can play in Indian defence. Thirdly, I had several chances of conferring with the appropriate officials, and with representative members of the Assembly, upon the several problems connected with the development of civil flying. These questions I am, of course, taking up in greater detail with the Secretary of State for India. I may however, say in a single sentence, that there appeared to be no disagreement between the representatives of the Government of India and myself; thatduring my visit the Viceroy&apos;s Council actually agreed to the addition of the two squadrons, and that the talks that I had with officials, members of the Assembly[15794]CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 62 (27).Printed for the Cabmet.   February 1927.
and business men, went to show that a definite beginning would at once be made upon a civil aviation policy that will be in general harmony with our own. I am not vain enough to think that these results were achieved by any special quality of my own. It rather happened that, at the very moment when the Government of India were contemplating developments both on the military and civil sides, the Minister responsible for British flying was on the spot, and was able to discuss with them the lines of an advance, that should materially benefit both India and ourselves, and at the same time strengthen the ultimate reserves of Imperial air power.Incidentally to these bigger questions, I was able to hear the views of many officials upon several other interesting proposals. I pick out two of these as typical examples. Would it not be cheaper and better for our Resident in the Persian Gulf to use a seaplane for his visits to our spheres of influence upon the Arabian coast, in place of the steamer that the Government of India hires for the same purpose at more than a hundred pounds a day for some seventy days in the year? Is it not urgently necessary to make an air survey of the Arabian coast with a view to creating a chain of landing grounds that will enable Air Force units to be transferred by air to India without the. need of touching upon Persian territory? These and other similar questions I have already put in train, and I hope to discuss them in detail with the responsible authorities.In Iraq, I purposely spent three nights with the object of discussing various defence questions with Sir Henry Dobbs and the A.O.C., Sir Edward Ellington. Even more than on the occasion of my last visit, I was impressed by the fact that in Iraq, flying, whether military or civil, is the key of the country Vdevelopment. Upon the civil side it is the. key that most quickly unlocks the corridors of Europe and India, and it may be worth noting as significant of this fact that, in the face of a 40 miles gale, I made the 900 miles&apos; flight from Baghdad to Cairo in the course of a single day. Upon the military side it is, and must in my view remain, the key that closes the door on disorder and insecurity. These facts are freely admitted by every public man in Iraq, whether British or Arab. These facts are pushing into notice certain questions that must be shortly settled. What is to happen to the country if in 1928 the Air Force squadrons are completely withdrawn % How can the threat of external aggression or of internal disorder be met unless Air Force units continue to remain ? These questions, constantly urged upon me during my stay, I naturally refused to answer. It was, however, interesting to note that the Iraqis seemed to have abandoned their more nationalist conceits, and to be, above all things, anxious that in our future dispositions of the Air Force in the Middle East we should not suddenly leave them defenceless.In Egypt, the questions that I mainly raised with Lord Lloyd were connected with civil flying. He did, however, tell me that he would welcome the addition of another squadron to the garrison of either the Soudan or of Egypt itself, and that he regarded as of great importance to British interests in Egypt the attempt that I am making to open a regular line of air communication between Egypt, the Soudan and East and South Africa. As to civil aviation, I had numerous discussions with him, King Fuad and the Egyptian Ministers who are mainly concerned with the question. Some months ago negotiations of an extremely confidential kind were started between the Imperial Airways Company and a group of Egyptian financiers, with a view to forming a company to be operated by Imperial Airways for an air service between Europe and Egypt. A service of this kind is of the utmost importance to us in the developing of a through air route from England to India. Moreover, its creation would, in the opinion of Lord Lloyd and myself, mean the creation of a&apos; British operating monopoly, and would on this account greatly strengthen our position in dealing with the frequent applications of foreign Powers to start flying routes to Egypt. The negotiations, perhaps due to the fact that the intermediary between the British and Egyptian interests proved unreliable, had been protracted for many weeks. I cannot say at present how far my stay in Cairo has really advanced them. I can, however, claim that my conversations with the Minister of Communications appeared to have improved the atmosphere, and that the conference that was held upon the subject at the Residency was of great Value both to myself and the representatives, of the Imperial Airways Company. Whilst I do not wish to burden my colleagues with details of these conversations, I will only say that the conclusion reached was in full accord with the view of the Committee of Imperial Defence, that in present conditions non-British flying must if possible be kept out of Egypt, and in support of my own opinion that the most practical way of achieving this result is to obtain what would amount to a flying
monopoly for a British operating company. Here again, I am of course hoping to discuss the question in greater detail with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Thirdly, there is the propaganda effect of the flight, particularly amongst British subjects overseas. Being somewhat of a sceptic in the matter of propaganda, I am not inclined to exaggerate the effect of such a journey. I must, however, have been blind, if I had failed to notice the really remarkable enthusiasm that was created&apos;amongst British citizens at every point where we landed. Our arrival evidently seemed to them to be an outward and visible sign of the vigour of British enterprise. Here was a British Minister descending from the clouds, and visiting, in the course of a few weeks, the whole line of British influence from Malta to Chitral. Here was a British machine, with three British engines, flying many thousands of miles, over land and sea, in fair and foul weather, without a delay or the need of a repair, and carrying the first woman who had ever made a long-distance flight. Here was a conspicuous example of the mobility upon which our Empire depends for its defence and its communications. Here was a new instrument, that, by eliminating time and distance, might be of incalculable value to the future of Imperial intercourse, it was these impressions, according to three such different men as the Viceroy, Lord Lloyd and Sir Henry Dobbs, that stirred the British communities in the countries that I visited. It was these impressions also that gave Indians, Egyptians and Iraqis to think that British enterprise was not enfeebled, and that British influence was not contracting. So far as my humble self was concerned, I was glad to be the stimulus to this process of thought, and to feel that my journey, always interesting, often tiring, sometimes perhaps risky, had, in the view of men whose judgment I trust, been of value in proving the excellence of British pilots and machines, and in emphasising the importance of aviation, whether military or civil, to the future of the Empire.S.
