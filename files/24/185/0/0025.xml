BRUSSELS   CONVENTION ON IMMUNITY OP STATE OWNED SHIPS.M^nprandumi by Sir ff. Tyrrell.-.le      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,, who will be at Geneva when this question comes before the Cabinet, has instructed me to circulate s memorandum explaining the point of view of the Foreign Office.-2.      The action to be taken in regard to this Convention formed the subject of discussion at a meeting held at the Foreign Office on October 29 last, which was attended by the Solicitor General,,  Sir Leslie Scott,  the Treasury Solicitor,  the Solicitor to the Board of Trade, and repre-sentatives of the Admiralty and Board of Trade-    The minutes recording the conclusions reached at the meeting were oir-oiulate to those present and approved by thema    In accordance with those conclusions, a draft protocol supplementary to the Convention,  and a draft despatch instructing His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Erussels to communicate the protocol to the Belgian Government and to inform them that we were prepared to send two experts to Brussels to explain the protocol and the views of His Majesty1s Government, were sent officially to the Admiralty and Board of Trade for concurrence on December 13.    These departments concur: ed in these drafts, and the communication to the Belgian Government was made accordingly at the end of January.    On February 8 the Belgian Government replied that they were prepared  to consider the manner in which the wishes of His Majesty1s Government, could be met, and suggested that the experts should come over about February 22o    In view, however,  of
FOREIGN OFFICE,4th March, 19 27.the difficulties which  subsequently arose&apos;, it has been necessary bo inform the Belgian Government that His Majesty1s Government are compelled  to postpone the visit of the experts.3s      I think it is clear  that,  in view of the composition of the meeting at which the action to be taken was agreed upon and the subsequent official correspondence with the Admiralty and the Board of Trade,  tho foreign Office were entitled to assume,  as they did,  that all the authorities and departments concerned were in agreement with the policy embodied in the communication made to the Belgian Government.    If it is decided  that His-Majesty1s Government can be parties to the Convention,  subject to the acceptance of the protocol, completed,if it is thought necessary,  by the addition of some further safeguards from the point of view of procedure, the Foreign Office will be prepared to make the necessary communication to the Belgian Government and to do their best to obtain the consent of the Belgian Government and the other Governments signatories to the Convention to the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government; but a refusal to accept the Convention at all would,  in the view of the Foreign Office, not only be inconsistent with the action taken at the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923 and the recent Imperial Conference but would also place His Majesty&apos;s Government in an extremely awkward position vis-a -vis of the Belgian Government.
