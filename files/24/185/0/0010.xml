CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.      30CP. 61 (27).RELATIONS  WITH  THE  SOVIET  GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AS suggested at the Cabinet, I have drafted the following alternative concluding paragraph to the draft note to the Soviet Government prepared by the Foreign Office. The actual wording is, of course, merely suggestive.In niy view if serious loss of British life occurred in China, by which I mean, a number of soldiers, traders or missionaries killed or massacred, feeling in this country and in Parliament would attribute such a result in no small measure to the machinations of the Soviets and would not tolerate the continuance of relations with them. It would be impossible for English families to receive the news of the killing of their sons and brothers by mobs or armed forces spurred on and instructed by Russian Bolshevists and yet acquiesce in the authors of these wrongs being accorded not merely the means to continue their propaganda in our midst but even the ceremonial usages of the Court and of the Foreign Office. The shedding of blood and the loss of life would be a signal which none could ignore. If this be true, ought we not to say so in advance ? Do we not thereby give to our people in China the best chance of escaping without maltreatment ? Do we not give to the Soviets the best chance of proving a desire for better relations ? Do we not propound a policy which the country and Parlia-ment will understand and would regard at once as practical and prudent&apos;? Do we not gain the maximum security against a future evil, postpone for the time being an admittedly extremely difficult decision, and at the same time prepare a foundation upon which should the worst come to the worst action would be clear and simple ? If no catastrophe occurs, our hands are free, nay indeed Russian relations may enter upon a better phase. If on the other hand there is serious bloodshed, we are threatening nothing that we shall not be irresistibly forced to do, and we are only threatening it in time to give the best chance of averting the evil.W. S. C.February 16, 1927.15788Printed for the Cabinet.
Hitherto, as His Majesty&apos;s Government may freely admit, the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics have not been successful in any of their main hostilities against the British Empire. That is not due to any want of effort on the part of the Soviets bub to the natural and inherent strength of the organism they are attacking&quot;. Irritation and annoyance have been caused, waste and loss have been suffered, breach of agreement and provocation of all kinds have occurred. But of actual bloodshed or loss of life there has as yet been no example. In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government, against all precedent in diplomatic inter-course, in spite of a deep sense of injury and in the face of ever-growing popular resentment, have nevertheless persevered in keeping in existence an open a channel of communication with Russia, for whose people and whose interests they entertain a high regard and wdth whom they most sincerely desire to live on friendly and mutually advantageous terms.But it is obvious that a point will be reached beyond which all such endeavours would become simultaneously vain and unworthy. This point may be reached in various ways. It may be reached either by continuance and aggravation of the present&quot; evil practices towards His Majesty&apos;s Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. It would certainly be reached if at any time these annoyances eventuated in a violent or lethal episode. In this connection the course of affairs in China presents the cause of greatest immediate anxiety. His Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that directly or indirectly and they care not which-the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics have laboured to direct the legitimate national aspirations of the Chinese people into an exclusively, or at least predominantly, anti-British channel. As the consequence various dangerous events have occurred, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have been forced, for the purpose of protecting the lives of their subjects, to make military and political exertions and to transport a considerable body of soldiers to the other side of the globe.It is the hope and firm belief of His Majesty&apos;s Government that a peaceful and bloodless settlement of the present difficulties will be achieved, though possibly not until after a lengthy and difficult period has been traversed. In the meantime tliey feel it their duty to make it clear to the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics that should the hopes of a peaceful and favourable outcome in China be frustrated and should in fact any serious collision or loss of life to British subjects or British soldiers occur, they will hold themselves the sole judges of the responsi-bility of the Soviet Government in the matter, and unless they are satisfied that the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics have clone every-thing in their power from this time forward to avert lamentable incidents
will feel themselves unable to continue any longer the efforts they have made and are making to maintain the machinery of diplomatic and commercial relations between the two Governments. His Majesty&apos;s Government utter this warning while there is time for the Soviet Government, if they attach any value to their relations with Great Britain, to prove by practical steps and their consequences that they desire their continuance.
