LADY ASTOB:    First I want to thank you for receiving this great and noble body of women,  and I am reminded that the first organised body of women to appeal for justice were daughters of Selophehd,who went to Moses and asked that they might inherit the lands of their father.     Moses very wisely asked the Lord, and the Lord&apos;&apos;s answer was on the side of the women;    the only thing was that they should not rnarry out of their Tribeo     We know that there are some men in the world to-day who are a little behind Moses, and some of them are called Lords, and when women appeal to them for equal rights and justice^  they do not call on the Lord.     We are rejoiced that you.  a great commoner j, have pledged yourself to give women equal franchise, in this Parliament.     We agree with your Cambridge speech fully.     We have always realised that true democracy will have to depend upon men and women, and we realise that when troubles, come the women get the hard end of the stick.     We feel that they will always get it until they have complete equality with men.      We are grateful to you for making that promise,  and will be more grateful when we see it carried out in this Parliament.      I myself have never doubted your wovcl, but have been a little discoiiraged by some of those round you.      I will first of all ask Lady Rliondda to address you.IADY RHONDDA:    I should like to being by thanking you for your courtesy in receiving us to-day and giving us this opportunity both of hearing your views on the question on which we feel very deeply, and also of coming into touch with you personally so that we may give you also our views *      I think that you know that this deputation is representative of the whole Women&apos;s movement.      It is supported by 56 Societies.     They are not all present to-day because ths^o was not room for a representative of each Society, htoVthoy-
would all have been present is possible,  and there are in fact 24 representatives of Societies    present to-day, and I want to put very shortly and quite clearly exactly what it is we are asking you to do,     Vie are asking for the fulfilment of the pledge that at the next General Election there will be no difference in age at which men and women will vote,  and that they should hoth vote on the same terms. Vie ask for a simple franchise measure giving votes to women at 21 or. the same terms as men, and we ask that you should introduce a Bill immediately and carry it through all its stages this Session because we feel that unless the Bill is law by next June there will be a grave danger that women may not vote at the next General Election.      If the Bill is passed by June,  it will still give time for all women to get on the October Register, and. if they do that in 1927, that should be time enough;    but if it is delayed past June, they cannot get on to the October,  1927 Register and they must then wait until 1928,  and if they have to w ait so long as that, there is grave danger that they may not be able to vote at the next General Election, because this Parliament, If it lives its normal course, Is In the ordinary course of events,   judged by history of past Parliaments for the past 10-0 years,  is unlikely to live past the autumn of 1928.      One other point I would like to make, Sir.      We would very strongl? urge that this franchise should be given us - we want a straightforward franchise measure, and. we do most strongly deprecate being mixed up with such contentious questions as proportional representation,  plural voting or poor law enfranchisement.      If as a result of the enfranchisement of five million voters redistribution is found to be necessary, we would suggest that redistribution can very well follow
the enfranchisement measure, but what we want at the   233 present moment is the measure by itself not mixed up with anything else giving votes to women at 21 the same as to men.MISS ELEANOR RATHBONE:    Mr. Prime Minister,  theUnion I represent is drawn from all parts of England,Scotland and Wales.     It is the lin3al descendant of theformer National Union of Women&apos;s Suffrage Societies -the oldest national suffrage society in the country -which under the presidency of my predecessor, DameMillicent Fawcett, worked for nearly fifty years to obtainthe vote for women &quot;on the same terms as it is or maybe granted to men&quot;*     From that demand my Union has neverswerved for a moment.     As some prominence has been givenin the Press of the last few days to certain differences of opinion that have occurred among us, I wish to assureyou that those differences have no relation whatever,direct or indirect, to the question of equal voting rights.I have had a letter from Lady Balfour of Burleigh onbehalf of herself and certain other members who resignedfrom our Executive Committee, making that perfectly clear.On the subject of Equal Franchise there is completeunanimity among us.      I believe the same thing may fairly be said of nearly the whole of the women&apos;s organisations of this country,  at least of those which are free  to holdany opinion on political subjects.      I have here a list of45 national societies, with 109 of their branches, which took part in a mass meeting held only last Thursday, to demand this right.     You will note that many of them aresocieties    organised for social or humanitarian purposes,who have through their work been brought to share the conviction that Equal Franchise rights- are for thecommunity&apos;s good.     But as to the merits of this claim, Ibelieve we are speaking to the converted.     On the questionof merits, I desire only to make a single point.      The great-3-
major it ?/ of women who work for their living, in industries or professions, are among the unenfranchised,     ^ Every year Parliament considers Bills,  such as your own Factories Bill, Load Paint Act,  Insurance Bills, which vitally affect the conditions under which those women earn their livings,  impose on them restrictions, or ask from them contributions&apos;.     Whatever the merits of this legislation, it is dangerous that the --omen it concerns should be without the means of influencing Parliament which male workers possess.     There is rivalry between men and women workers in many occupations.      It cannot be said that In this matter the already enfranchised women adequately represent the unenfranchised.    The majority of tho enfranchised are wives and mothers., who may look at these questions of sex competition from the point of view of their husbands and sons, rather than of their unenfranchised sisters..The other points I wish to make refer to the Parliamentary time-table.    May I be permitted to hand you a copy of the statement made by yourself on the subject ox equal political rights before the last General Election, and also of certain passages from the stateaient made on your behalf by the Home Secretary on February 2 0th, 1925^ May I be perfectly frank?     Those whom I represent have no doubt whatever of your intention to carry out your pledges.   We have no doubt whatever that It is not your intention to keep these promises to the ear, but break them to the sense.      But if too great risks are run with the Parliamentary time-table, that might easily be the effect which might result.      The lives of Parliaments, as of individuals, are subject tc many risks,  and these grow greater as their normal span of life approaches Its termination.      Few Parliaments fulfil their maximum span of five years.    This Parliament is In its third year already.    Since the Economy Act, the Parliamentary Register
o q ris now normally made up only once a year.    The qualifying^J period ends on June 1st, and the Register is not ready for use until the following October 15th.&apos;   It follows therefore that, unless special provision is made,  if the newly en-franchised women are to vote in an election held before Ootober 15th of any year, it would be necessary for the Enfranchising Act to have reached the Statute Book before June 1st of the preceding year.    Even if provision is made for making up a special register shortly after the enfranchisement-chising Act comes Into  force,   it would scarcely be practically possible for the newly enfranchised women to vote until at least seven or eight months after the Act had passed into law.      It is not for us,  Sir,  to erenture to advise you as to how these difficulties may be meto    Bat bearing in mind the shortness of the period which at best remains and the obvious risks that some unforeseen contingency may still further shorten it, we do beg of you,  first, to deal with the question at the earliest possible moment; and secondly, not to imperil our just claim by mixing up the simple? straightforward question of equal voting rights for men and women at twenty-one with any other complicated or contentious issue-MRS. HOOP;    Mr. Prime Minister, I represent here this afternoon something like over one million women composed of three different organisations-    First of all there Is the Trade Union element, there is the Cooperative Women Ts Guild,  and the Women rs section of the labour Party. In the former Unions we have 700,000 members,  and in the labour sections we have 300,000,  and in the women&apos;s Co-operative Guild 60,000.      All these organisations have repeatedly had resolutions on their Congress agendas asking that women should be granted the vote on the same conditions as men.    Year after year the same thing has happened. The Trade Union women are the women who are out In industry
and have their living to make,  and while they have to subscribe by taxation towards the Services maintained, such as the Army and Navy, Widows and Cld Age Pensions and health and unemployment insurance, at present they have no voice as to the making of those law3 which they have to pay to help got carried out.    The position at the present time is that where there is a family of boys and girls, the girls may be more conscientious, and my experience of working class households is that the girls are far more responsible at 21 than the boys are.    At present these boys have votes while their elder sisters have not*    It gives rise to most peculiar positions.      For Instance in my own household I have two children,  one a daughter and one a son.    The daughter is 9 years older than he with a more thoughtfuA disposition,  and having to earn her living therevare all sorts of obstacles arose.    It is true that she was having a room furnished for herself, but the final objection was that she was having her meals with her father and mother.     We want to do away with all this ridiculous nonsense and put our boys and girls on the same footing. They are men and women,  and when yon come to be the mother of these you look upon them as boys and girls.    Now the ?Jomenrs Co-operative Guild, that is composed of women who are married and are in their own homes and not so many out in industry, but that same thing applies to them.      Many of thom are married at an early age and have children; many of them with many children before 30 years of age, and although they may be keenly interested in th e eduuati&amp;D of their children, they have no voice whatever in electing representatives In the House of Commons to look after their interestso    I rill say this, that the women of the Women rs Cooperative Guild are thrifty.
The very feet that they belong to a Cooperative Society shows that,  and they are not allowed any voice in the making of the laws of the country.    Then we come to those in the women Ts section of the labour Party.      They are composed of industrial and married women, and their function Is to try and educate the women politically. They are not the only Party doing this.      You have the same thing,  and your own organisation feel the same as my organisation feels, that every now and again they are brought up against a brick wall because they have no vote to enforce the  refoms they would like to see taking place, and every time they are brought up against this brick wall. We have been told with  regard to this by all the parties, we have been promised time after time they will give us this privilege we are asking for,  and we have been put off the promise,   and we do not went that to happen nowr,    When the Labour Party were in power, or rather they were neither in power nor had tho time to do anytfaIng for us, but you are the head of a Government with a majority such as has never been known before, and we ask you as the Leader of that Parliament to do all in your power to grant the same  justice to the women of the country as is granted to the men of the country.EH. Bo HEIGHT:    I want to speak for the Society which has been working for the last 30 years very hard indeed for the equal vote for women with men under the Presidency of Mrs. Despardo    I also want to mention the women living, in the other parts cf the Empire, the Irish  Free State\, Australia,  Canada and Rhodesia, where they have equal v;htoS, with men,  and hundreds of them are over here every  year pursuing their studies.    These young women have had the vote,
usually over 21, taken their degrees in their own country and they come over here,  and they have no vote, and they feel at a disadvantage;    it seems to them very, unfair naturally.    And there is another aspect of it, that it seems to them unfortunate that women are looked upon in a different way to what they are in those other parts of the Empire;    they are looked upon in an unequal way here, and British women feel it unfair that women from the other parts of the Empire should see that they are looked upon In an unequal way and not considered worthy of the vote here,   although they have it in most parts of the Empire, and we do feel very keenly Indeed that women ought to have the vote on equal terms here. You have no idea of the way women do feel here that they have not got the vote at 21,  and we do really urge very strongly indeed that we should have that equal vote -just that one thing - the same terms and the same age, and you should bring it in at once and get it through by next summer so that we can get rid of this dissatis-faction and uncertainty,  and then we can vote at the Election whenever it comes along.,MISS HcS. PAENHLL:    I am here today to represent in a special manner the 3 million young women who, like myself, have not got the vote.    We young women feel that there is no justification at all for this differentiation between ourselves and our brothers.     &quot;We have beerK. educated at the same schools,,  either Elementary, Secondary or more expensive schools,, we have passed the same standard,  and feel we are equally qualified for the vote.   We specially; resent the differentiation between the men University graduates and the women University graduatessbecause there the
women can show the identical qualification that the men can show, and yet a women has to wait 9 years before she can exercise a votewhereas the man exercises his at once, and I can testify fromapersonal experience what a shock it is to many/woman when she feels that the country is slighting her in this manner, and it seems inconceivable tnat the country would trust to us these other grave responsibilities, and yet. will not give us this comparatively light responsibility of the vote.     A woman may have the care of a child as a mother; she may sit in the Municipal Council, she may stand for Parliament, and yet is not allowed to give a vote in a Parliamentary Election, and the pity of it is that it is England that is doing this to women - England with her high tradition of justice and fairplay,     All these other countries have given women the vote,  and yet England and Hungary have treated their women in a different way from men, and we feel that england  reputation for justice and fairplay is at stake in this matter, and it is not only as a matter of justice that we women are keen on getting the vote, but we do need it in everyday life0 Since the war nearly all of us have had to earn our own livingsu We have been told that two millions of us will probably never&apos; be able to marry - that is, keep ourselves all our lives.     Many of us have to contribute largely for family budgets, and a larger number than anyone  suspects have to maintain the family itself0 When you push out into professions and business we are confronted with difficulties of all kinds.      We either meet with jealousy of men when.we go to work, or put up with the dreadful conditions which a previous generation of women accepted - I mean domestic service, and if we had the vote we should at least fight our battle on equal terms, and should get a fair hearing when we have grievances,     Then too I would say that women are very keen on this matter because they feel that 30 is too late for them to begin developing a social conscience.      I have tried over and over again to interest girls of 17 and 18 in national affairs,\
2iiiand directly they near that -they cannot vote till 30, they will not listen, and many of these girls at this moment are praying that this deputation may he a success because they  -are so keen that when they get to 21 they may be able to play their part in national affairs 0      And I would say as a last point that the women are wonderfully keen, and if the -votes are not granted by the next Election, they will be bitterly disappointed; and when I came from Liverpool this morning I came with the good wishes of men and women of every Party and every grade , and you will disappoint a great number of people if you cannot bring in this Bill enfranchising all of us by the next Election;,THE HON, MRS. FRANKLIN:      I have the honour to representing the National Council of Women, which has affiliated to it  over 145 national women s societies,      They are not just ad hoc suffrage societies, they are a Society such as the Mothers&apos; Union, the Young Women&apos;s Christian Association, the Charity Organisation, the Society of British Matrons and so on, who might even be considered to represent the stodgy rather morebackward women of the nation, but they unanimously at their Conference at Brighton voted for this equal franchise,  and this year in London again unanimously re-affirmed their desire that immediately men and women should stand equal in the sight of the State,     Some of these delegates voted for them-selves in their own capacity, all being younger women, hut others voted because they desired not only justice for the younger women about which other speakers have spoken, but also because taey exaggerated in their own view their idea of the flightiness or the unsteadiness of the young women  of the countrye        It is all very well to speak
on platforms and write in the papers about the flight ine24 1 of the mod-rn girl.      Some of us think that has always been the cry of the older generation, but we do recognise that duties and responsibilities develop a balancing and steadying&apos; influence.     The last speaker spoke for the young women themselves in their feeling of disappointment when after their lessons in school and University as to tneir duties in citizen-ship, when their enthusiasm is stimulating, they nave year by year to feel their enthusiasm lessening, their interest dwindling and taking part in other directions rather than helping, as they should, in the duties of a real citizens Then there is an entirely different class which we are some-times some of us apt to forget, and that is this class about which we have spoken only represents about 3 million women, but there are another 2 million women who are disfranchised not because of age, but many of them are professional women living in their own homes or furnished rooms, women who are Doctors and Teachers or Artists, people who may be my daughter, possibly your daughter, who are disfranchise^,, and their contribution to the affairs of the State is losto   . For all these reasons my Council would beg you to carry out your promise this year0 - -MISS D.F.g FROUD:      I have to speak for the vote less women in the Education Service.      This great Service  occupies some hundreds of thousands  of women as teachers, doctors or nurses, and an ever increasing number &quot;of women are serving on Education Committees, so that here you have a great body of women educating, doing national service, keen on their work and furthering the interest in public welfare questions, and it would be true to say of these women that 50/i of them are un-enfranchised with no chance of being franchised because many of them are living in furnished rooms or apartments.     A man in the teaching service can get a vote because he is a citizen on a six months&apos;  residential qualification but we have to havea very different qualification - a house or flat.     Everybody-11-
knows tiiat it is trie men who for the greater part have homes of their own, whereas we professional women are forced to live in furnished rooms or hoarding houses, and are consequently disfranchised,,Now, my Union has been seeking information on these points, and we find that in a city like Bradford 400 women teachers over 30 years of age are disfranchised because they are living in boarding houses, hostels, institutions or with their parents0     At the training college at Swansea there are 7 lecturers over 30 years of age who have not a vote, but are keenly interested in local politicso     Their senior woman doctor at the clinic also Is disfranchised,. West Ham employs a vast number of teachers, and in that case many have no political vote.      Their only doctor also is disfranchiseda      It Is the same in the country, where there are numbers of women who are disfranchised0The ;i:en get their votes merely by the fact that they are 21, and we women are in this very anomalous position,      I do beg you to believe that we feel this very keenly, and we think it affects our status most detrimentally in all we have to do, Now, I spent this week-end in reading Hansard, and all the pledges me.de in the House since February, 1925, and I came to the conclusion that if the Prime Minister had read his Hansard and had listened to those pledges there was really nothing more for us to say on this side,,     You must be convinced of the logic and the glaring justice of our demand, and you must be aware that this demand must be satisfied and that very soon,      The women&apos;s organisations are all united in this demand, and really there is nothing more to be said except to ask the Prime Minister when he is going to introduce legislation giving votes to women on the scans terms as men, so that they will really vote with men of the same age at the next election^LADY ASTOR:      I think.that is all, and we anxiously await your reply.
PRIME MINISTER:      Lady Astor and Ladies:    First of all, I apologise for having kept you waiting.      I had it firmly in my mind that the deputation was at 6 o&apos;clock.      I ;as wrong, and we had rather an Important debate proceeding, and I had to be in the House of Commons,I do not know, Lady Astor, whether it is your management of this deputation, but I have received a great many deputations, and I think I would put this equal to the best that I have received in the way in which each speaker has said clearly and succinctly what she desired to say and nothing more.     The points could not have been put better, and In a little over half an hour I have heard all that I want to hear and all you could possibly have said if you had taken twice the time,,Lady Rhondda observed that she wanted to hear my views,, I will put it in this way:  &apos;   I wanted to hear yours.      I do feel some sympathy with you, that you have not heard anything definite from the Government yet, hut I would remind you that this last year has been rather an exceptional one for any Government.      We all of us have been over-worked, and we have load a great load of very difficult matters corthng before us to be dealt with as a result of the labour troubles of last year, follovved by one of the most extraordinarily difficulties\ilt situations In China that any Government has had to face . These are constant and pressing anxieties, and with the ordinary routine of Government business and the gradual fulfilment, as I hope,  of Government pledges, ?/e have had our time very, very fully occupied.    &apos; We are getting very near the time -now when ;--e shall make our definite pronouncement on this matter, and the pledges which have been given you have reminded me of, but I have promised tho House of Commons that before Easter a full statement of the Government1s intentions will be made,-13-
and there is nothing more that I can say to you this afternoon than that we shall make tnat statement to the House of Commons, which is the proper place to make a statement of such vital importance, before Easter0You ask that whatever may be done  should be done in this Session,      I doubt very much the possibility of that because of time, but I do not quite accept the view which has-been put forward about the life of a Parliament, nor do I quite accept all the dates that have been given.     If it were the desire of the Government - and here I am speaking purely hypothetically because I oannot say anything to you at all until I have met the House of Commons - there can be no difficulty, and I think the Home Secretary^y v/ill confirm me here - so far as the Registers are concerned if a certain Act is dated this year or early next year.SIR W. JOYN30N-HIOKS:      That is so, PRIME MINISTER:      So far as that difficulty may be supposed to exist, it Is not really one that need cause you any concern.     This whole matter, together with a number of very important questions, is at the moment engaging the attention of the Government, and I am very glad to have seen youo      I know you asked to see me last year, and you very kindly put off this meeting because of the amount of work that lay upon us In the Autumn0      This meeting will be useftil to me in putting clearly your views and your desires, which I shall take care are handed to the Cabinet.       And I also note what you have to say in the event of such a Bill as you desire being introduced, that you wish it to he a simple Bill and clear of matter which you regard rather as extraneous.I do not think that there is any question I wish to ask you. You have covered the ground so admirably, and I think amongst you you have touched upon pretty nearly all classes-14-
of women and women in all kinds of work.      I think I have got your points quite clearly In my mind, and it only remains for me, Lady Astor, now to thank you for having come, for the very small amount of time which you have consumed in this deputation, and to re-affirm the statement which I made in the House of Commons that- full information will he given to Parliament before Easter as to what the Government propose to do.      There is nothing more that I can say to you tihis afoemocn.r    I knew you wished to see me to state your views, and I was very glad to have them,, LADY ASTOEs     Thank you very much0The Proceedings then terminated) .2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W010 March 14th, 19270
