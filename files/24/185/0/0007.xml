There is much to be said for the view that in thepresent financial condition of the country and in view of the general demand for economy, this is not tho time to enter into, or to let local authorities enter into, the heavy programme ox commitments recommended by tho Royal Commission.      If tho anticipated growth of Bead ]?nnd revenue shews a margin from which the work of construction of these Roads and Bridges and Tunnels can be financed, the available funds might be used in reduction of the burden of taxpayers or af ratepayers and the consequent relief might prove a far&apos; greater encouragement to industry than would the cempletion -   of traffic improvements, acme of which are ox the nature if a luxury.2. The Ministry of Transport memorandum dsals onlyours^rily with the proposal of tbe Lee Commission that the Government share of the oast of their programme Should be met by raising a loon of  19 saillion on the security of the Bead Fund.      In effect the proposal is simply one for an ordinary Government lean of  19 million for the Bridges &amp;c.  of London.      This would be difficult to justify at any time, but it must be regarded as quite out of the quest inn at the moment when for purposes o:t* reducing our very heavy debt charge we aro doing our
utmost to reduce fresh Government &quot;borrowing.     We have already very large commitments in this rospect which are proving and are likely to continue to prove exceedingly embarrassing to our general finance, but we have made a definite stand against adding further to these commitments, in particular by bringing to an end the Trade Facilities Acts, and we oould not conceivably now open the door to a new form of new borrowing. The considerations of general financial policy were, of course, not in the minds of the Commission, which apart from Sir William Plender did not contain any member with financial knowledge.3. It is of great importance that it should bemade absolutely plain at the earliest possible moment, that loan operations of the kind indicated could not be contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government.4. If however the Government regard the revenuesderived from motors as something apart from the national finances, not to be drawn on for general purposes, and consider that, in view of their intervention to appoint the Royal Commission,  It is not possible to disregard, their recommendations, then we suggest that the most pressing of the schemes recommended and in particular those which, are most valuable for industrial develop-ment  (e.g. Victoria Docks Hoad) should be selected and an announcement made that grants will be made on a 75$ or a 50$ basis as the case nay be out of the 2oad Pund.5. But it is neithor necessary nor desirable tocarry to a Suspense Account a sum of  1,000,000 a year for 15 years for the purpose of financing the Government share of these schemes as suggested by the Ministry of Transport.      It should be sufficient to deal with a
definite limited   programme Including the more urgent works, without committing tie Fund further now as to the more remote future.      Such a limitation ought to define fa) the particular schemes for which we now accept a commitment and  (b) the capital sum for such schemes towards which the Pund would make a percentage contribution.6. As regards the selection of schemes for grantwe agree with the policy sketched In the Ministry of Transport memorandun.      This implies(a) the acceptance in principle of the Commissions recommendations as regards the central area (Waterloo Bridge,  Charing Cross Bridge and ludgate Bridge) to which might be added the Victoria Docks Scheme, subject to(b) proper estimates of cost being obtained from responsible Engineers ox high standing, with reconsider a-tion should it appear that the proposals are substantially more costly than they are estimated to be h$ the Commission. (There is reason to think that the estimate of  7-g- millions for Charing Cross Bridge is particularly precarious).to) the contribution of the Road Pund to Ludgate Bridge, if the City accept the Commissions scheme, being limited to 50$ of the cost of the road approaches estimated at  1,000,000.This in effect means accepting here and now liability to contribute towards an expenditure of about  14-g- millions L7. We do not think liability ought to be acceptedhere and now for the further schemes indicated by the Commission.      It will be a long time before these can in bulk   mature, particularly if the heavy expenditure in paragraph 6 is being incurred.      They can be considered
when the time eomes, always in relation to the then&apos; financial position of the Road Fund.8. The Treasury agree entirely with theobjections of the Ministry of Transport to the proposal to constitute a special central authority.     Such a body with neither executive nor rating powers, with large Government funds to distribute but no responsibility to Parliament, and constituted as to a majority of representatives of local authorities would be an anomaly in the constitution and could not long survive Parliamentary criticism.T re asury Chamberlain e rs, S.W.1, February,  1927.
