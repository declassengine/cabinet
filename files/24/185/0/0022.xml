CP. 73 (27).THE POLICY OE THE U.S.S.R-. IN CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues the attached translation of 083 a report on Soviet policy in China, which has been handed by the Polish military 5548 attache in London to the General Staff. The Polish military attache states that, in the opinion of the Polish General Staff, the facts given in the report can be considered reliable, but that the conclusions drawn were the personal views of the agents responsible for its compilation. The General Staff are not in a position to vouch for the accuracy of this report, and are of opinion that the contents should be accepted with reserve; but the statement that the Revvoensoviet (R.V.S.)* is playing a leading part in directing Soviet policy in China agrees with the information already in the possession of the Army Council.This report also confirms earlier information that Moscow believes in limiting the territorial gains of the Cantonese so as to be certain that proper consolidation is carried out; and in limiting the size of the Cantonese army so as to be sure that it can be controlled in conformity with Soviet interests.The intention attributed to the Bolsheviks to ensure the co-operation of the Cantonese and National armies and to prevent them amalgamating too soon, is of considerable interest.The reference to the Chinese Eastern Railway is further confirmation of the information in the hands of the Army Council that the Bolsheviks will avoid, if possible, any aggressive military action in this direction.The War Office,28th February, 1927. L. W.-E.The Military Department and the War : Eastern Situation.(Various data.)1. The R.V-S., the People&apos;$ Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and theSituation in China.ACCORDING to information received from, circles closely connected with the R.V.S. of the U.S.S.R., this organisation of the Military Department plays an important part in directing Soviet policy in the Far East.All current questions of Soviet policy in China are now dealt with both by the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and the R.V.S. This led to party circles suspecting that the Political Bureau is inclined to allow the conflict over the Eastern Chinese railways to be solved by an armed interference of the RA. This suspicion is without foundation; in principle, the Political Bureau and the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, as well as the R.V.S., remain opposed to armed interference.The strong influence of the R.V.S. in directing the Far Eastern policy may be explained by the following conditions : (1.) It is recognised that the future of Soviet interests in China at the present moment depend chiefly on the progress of the civil war, and therefore all stages of this conflict and its possibilities should be taken into careful*Note. The following abbreviations are used in this Memorandum : -R.V.S.      =   Revvoensoviet = Revolutionary Military Council; corresponds roughly toArmy Council. U.S.S.R.    =   Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. R.A. =   Red A.riny.P.U.R.      =   Political Military Administration.I.K.K.I.    is   Executive Committee of the Illrd (Communist) Internationale. O.G.P.U.   =   Special Government Political Administration (the successor of the Tcheka). (b27/17)  100 3/27  W.O.P.  3013Printed for the Cabinet.   March, 1927.SECRET. Copy No.    30
consideration. The R.V.S. is therefore consulted as a military expert, without whose advice the diplomatic measures taken by the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs might be unsuitable. The military control is regarded as being of such extreme importance that even all diplomatic communications of the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs with China are controlled by the R.V.S. (2.) It is reported (the information should be verified) that the R.V.S. has pointed out to the Political Bureau of the All-Russian Communist party several mistakes made by Karakhan when he was political represen-tative in Peking and also possesses data showing the unfriendly feeling of the higher military circles of the Canton Government towards this representative.2. The Militarisation of Soviet Diplomacy in China.In view of the above, the R.V.S. purposes that the Soviet representatives in China should be &quot;militarised.&quot; It considers that the diplomatic and consular personnel of the U.S.S.R. in China should have adequate military knowledge and training. A military adviser (for purposes of secrecy appointed by the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and regarded as a member of the established personnel) should be attached to every, more or less, independent representative of the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in the -Far East. This &quot;militarisation &quot; is essential both for obtaining information and for being able to guide the work of Chinese military commanders. The R.V.S. has proofs that the commanders of the Canton and People&apos;s army view the above-mentioned measures with great favour.It is of particular importance to have such military rep-representatives in Central China where independent units, which have hitherto either supported the reactionary forces or remained neutral, may at any moment join the Canton or National armies. The emissaries of the R.V.S. of the U.S.S.R. can in such cases be of special service, as they can guide the work of commanders who have joined the friends of ,the U.S.S.R.3. The Military Political Work in China.According to information proceeding from P.U.R. circles this organisation drafted the plan of political work to be carried out in the National army, together with General Feng-Yu-Hsiang, when he was in Russia. This plan places all the political work under the Kuo Min-tang, which, however, is obliged to keep in closest possible contact with the Chinese Communist party and, through it, with the I.K.K.I.The general direction of political work will be carried out by Feng-Yu-Hsiang, who is a representative of the Kuo Min-tang to the National army (thus ensuring the party a position of special importance); the technical supervision of the Political Department and its various branches in units (up to battalions) is entrusted to Li Shi-tsen, who is a Communist (though he does not advertise this fact) and instructed from Moscow.Military work in China is considered of the utmost importance. It is held that a successful organisation of military training would have beneficial results on. military operations and would make the Canton and National armies more popular.Former students of the Chinese University in Moscow (where a special course of military-political training was organised) will be employed as political instructors.4. Military Possibilities in China.The R.V.S. considers that there are very great possibilities in Canton. The fact that the Canton red army was able to organise and train in peace time is regarded as significant; it renders the army more stable than the armies of Chang Tso-lin and Wu Pei-fu, which are more exhausted and have been obliged to change their personnel owing to continuous fighting.The fact that the soldiers in the Chinese reactionary armies are not inspired by the same spirit as the commanding personnel is regarded as significant. In the Cantonese army the National-revolutionary spirit prevails and renders this army more stable and more likely to attain success.Taking into consideration the possible long duration of civil war in China, the R.V.S., as the secret guiding force of Chinese military operations, advises great care to be taken of the cadre personnel.   The Canton commanders have been warned of
the danger which would result from a further development of military successes on the territory and fronts and which would require a considerable increase of military forces. The said Government has accepted this advice, and the advance of the Canton red army will be limited so as to consolidate the position in newly-occupied territories and enable the troops to rest and increase their cadre personnel. Under these conditions (independently of the military situation in other parts of China) the defeat of the Cantonese troops is not taken into account.5. The &quot; Steps &quot; of Military Organisation in National-Revohitionary China.Very great attention is paid to the &quot; steps &quot; of military organisations in China. In explanation of this term, which has now been adopted by/Soviet military circles, the following points have been pointed out to us : Those conditions which led to the formation of &quot; green &quot; armies as well as white and red ones in the civil war in the U.S.S.R. are already taken into consideration in the civil war in China. The activity of the &quot;green&quot; armies was extremely significant in many sectors of the front, particularly in the rear of the white armies; while in spirit the &quot; green &quot; armies were more in sympathy with the red forces, they nevertheless avoided the political and military leadership of red commanders. In China the National army is similar to the green forces in Russia, while the Canton army is analogous to the red army.The main task of leadership is to ensure co-operation &quot;of these two forces and prevent them from amalgamating too soon, as this might have a disastrous effect on the stable revolutionary spirit of the Cantonese. The National army and the armies of other leaders, who have joined the Cantonese forces, should be regarded as a ;&apos; step &quot; for increasing the cadre forces of the Cantonese troops, and should therefore be subject to careful political instruction. Contrary to the time of the civil war in the U.S.S.R. the military elements of China, though not on a high level from the political point of view, have considerable military training, which will make it easier for those forces to join them, who, owing to political suspicion, would refrain from joining the Cantonese troops.At first the &quot; steps &quot; in the military organisation of China should be encouraged in every possible way. The barrier between national and Cantonese armies will begin to disappear with the growth of successes of the national revolution and the final victory of Canton.6. The Personality of Feng-Yu-Hsiang.The personality of Feng-Yu-Hsiang has been carefully studied during his sojourn in Russia. The military political workers of the O.G.P.U., who have had the greatest possibilities of studying his character, consider that they can rely on his union with the military commanders of the U.S.S.R. in the future. Feng-Yu-Hsiang has given assurances to accept the orders of the R.V.S., and as a proof of his goodwill has agreed to measures of liaison with the U.S.S.R. which practically means control of his activities by the Soviet military commanders.Possibly, at first, the influence of Feng-Yu-Hsiang may not be much felt on the surface, but in the future his political obligations towards the U.S.S.R. having been previously arranged he will undoubtedly be the leader of military work in China.7. The Military Forces of Mongolia and their Possible Role in the Future of China.The military-political importance of the U.S.S.R. in relation to the civil war in China is considerably increased owing to its almost uncontrolled influence on Mongolia. Mongolia and her military forces may be regarded almost entirely as the reserve force of Soviet military-political activity in China. Feng-Yu-Hsiang has been informed that the cadres of the Mongolian army will only be put at his disposal if he proves to the R.V.S. his abilities as an organiser of forces able to combat Chinese reaction. The assistance in equipment is rendered by the U.S.S.R. through the Mongolian army. In this way the R.V.S. has guaranteed the inviolability of its military fund in China, and, simultaneously, has interested the Chinese revolutionary commanders in the successes gained. Indirectly (via. Mongolia), the participation of the U.S.S.R. in the Chinese Civil War depends on them also.
8. Relative Strength of the Parties fighting in China.According to the view held by the R.V.S., the existing strength of cadre military-revolutionary armies in China is of no great value at the moment, owing to the possibility of entire divisions and army corps frequently going over to their recent enemies.In principle it is not even considered necessary to increase the cadre personnel, in view- of the number of unreliable soldiers and intermediary commanding personnel. The main task of the revolutionary commanders is therefore to educate the army from a political point of view. The numerical increase of the army should correspond to the higher political education.On the whole, the cadre personnel of the Canton and National armies, even in case of exceptional successes, should not, according to the view held by the R.V.S., be increased to more than double its present strength. The organisation of big regular (cadre) armies (numbering millions of men) would be a grave mistake for revolutionary China, and would possibly lead to serious disorders. The national revolutionary militia should be organised and employed for combating reaction in those provinces from which the men are drawn. The transfer of men belonging to the national militia to distant provinces is excluded, as it would lead to the demoralisation of stable military cadres in the badly-organised and undisciplined mass.The clanger of the leaders of Chinese reaction being successful in opposing the organised and revolutionary armies with superior (numerically) forces is regarded as relative. This would only be possible if Chang Tso-lin and his allies received considerable foreign support.9. Prospects of British or International Intervention in China.Tire R.V.S. considers that foreign intervention in China would be in the interests of the U.3.S.R., as it would lead to the undoubted &quot; revolutionising &quot; of the population. British intervention would primarily be a loss for Britain herself, as it Avould involve great expenditure and could not lead to any decisive success. The intervening forces will probably receive no assistance from Chinese troops, though they may be under the command, of such reactionary leaders as Chang Tso-lin and Wu Pei-fu. Cases of troops going over to the Canton and National armies would become more frequent, and the sympathy of the mass of the population would certainly not be on the side of the intervening forces.The situation would be changed if Japan participated in the intervention. The minority of the R.V.S., which doubts the loyalty of the Japanese to the U.S.S.R., holds the viewr that the intervention of this country would be as desirable as that of England, as it would injure the chances of Japan in China for many years to come, and would clear the way for the success of the U.S.S.R. The majority of members, however, consider that the participation of Japan would render the situation extremely grave and even constitute a menace to the U.S.S.R.In any case, Japanese intervention would change the fate of the civil war in China, and the influence of the U.S.S.R. on Feng-Yu-Hsiang and the Cantonese would probably be shaken.10. The Question of the Eastern Chinese Railway.The activity of the E.V.S. in this matter, in spite of the rumours prevailing in Moscow that the Red military leaders support the idea of an attack on Manchuria, is extremely limited. The members of the R.V.S. have agreed that military actions should be avoided, and that it is advisable to await a suitable moment when not only all Soviet claims would be satisfied, but consent would be obtained for the intro-duction of R.A. detachments into Manchuria for the protection of Soviet interests on the Chinese Eastern Railway. Such a bloodless victory would be much more valuable for Soviet prestige than the most successful intervention in Manchuria, as the latter method would give ground for propaganda against the U.S.S.R. among the Chinese masses, as against an aggressive State.
