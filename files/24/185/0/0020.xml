SECRET.Copy No. &quot;GOCOMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 221st Meeting, held on February 25, 1927.(1.) IRAQ REORGANISATION OF THE DEFENCE FORCES.(C.I.D. Paper No. 770-B.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Oversea Defence Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 770-B) on the subject of the Re-organisation of the Iraq Defence Forces, which had been referred to the Oversea Defence Committee by the Colonial Office.Mr. CHURCHILL said that the maintenance of internal order in Iraq depended fundamentally on the squadrons of aircraft, whether seven, ten or twelve, located in the main Air Force station at Hinaidi. As long as this entrenched camp for aircraft was kept secure, air power could operate all over the country; although he did not suggest that this air power would be sufficient to prevent invasion, it would act as a deterrent, and in any case enable the local Government to maintain internal order. The maintenance of British aircraft in Iraq also enabled any part of the Middle East to be reinforced without trouble or expense, and without any ostentatious movement of force. This aspect was, he suggested, the centre and foundation of the whole question under consideration.Mr. Churchill stated he accepted the idea that the Middle East, i.e., Egypt, the Sudan, Aden and Iraq, should be considered as one military sphere for aircraft in Imperial defence. He looked on the Air Force in Iraq as an integral part of the air power of Great Britain, and for this reason he did not consider that the local Govern-ment should be asked to pay more than the difference in cost between maintaining air units at home and abroad. Future capital expenditure, he suggested, should be made the subject of a legitimate claim on the local revenues, or a loan charge to be recovered in due course.On the other hand, the year 1928 was looked forward to as the time when Iraq would bear the whole cost of her administration, paying for all levies and forces used in that country, except the air force, for reasons already given. An exception to this principle might be necessary if an Imperial battalion had to be retained in Iraq for the security of the Hinaidi aerodrome.Apart from this, Mr. Churchill said that in his opinion it would be wrong to continue giving financial assistance to Iraq for defence purposes after 1928. It seemed to him that a new treaty allowing for the presence of British air forces in Iraq on the lines he had indicated should be made. We could inform Iraq that the British air forces would normally be there, and that they could make arrange-ments for local defence on that assumption. Such an arrangement would provide, firstly, for the maintenance of internal order in Iraq based on our air power, and, secondly, the necessary facilities for a British air scheme in the Middle Eafet. It would not, however, afford any guarantee for defence against serious invasion by Turkey, and, in his opinion, air, supplemented by native troops, could not be expected to deal alone with such an eventuality. The external defence of Iraq must be under-taken by the League of Nations, who might bring pressure to bear on Turkey elsewhere, either at Constantinople, by arrangement with Greece or Bulgaria, or by other means.Finally, Mr. Churchill suggested that the proposed scheme should now be worked out, and that negotiations with Iraq should be entered on during the coming year.SIR SAMUEL HOARE stated that when he was in Iraq a week ago he had talked to the High Commissioner, the Air Officer Commanding and some of the.!&quot; 15823-11 bPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1927.
native Government officials, and that all their views coincided with those just expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, except that, of course, Iraq wanted to get all the money she could. With regard to the two main points in the Oversea Defence Committee Report, as to whether the Air should be the primary arm and what the role of the Defence Forces should be, he had found that there was no disagreement, whether in civil or military circles, in Iraq on these, subjects. Everyone was convinced that air power is essential, and he had also been informed that its effects, far from becoming weaker, were actually increasing. Several instances of this had been mentioned to him, among them being the case of the Akwan tribes in the south, over whom the air has decidedly more influence than it had a year ago. Without question, therefore, air, in some shape or form, must be available in Iraq to maintain order, and he suggested that it would be preferable, that the air should be ours rather than Iraqi. The formation of an Iraqi air force would certainly have repercussions in Egypt and in other places, and for this reason he had been trying to postpone the creation of a local air force. If we did not now decide that British air forces are to remain in Iraq, we should be forced to agree to the formation of an Iraqi air force. British air forces in Iraq, while incidentally maintaining internal order, would be chiefly useful for reinforcing British garrisons elsewhere in the Middle East. He therefore asked that it should now be decided that the Air Force is to remain the predominant arm in Iraq, and that it will continue, to be British.With regard to the second point, as to whether the Iraq army should be organised for internal security duties or to repel external agg-ression, he had, after talking with Sir Henry Dobbs and Sir Edward Ellington, formed the conclusion that this was a purely academic question, because sufficient men did not exist in the country to form an army capable of repelling external aggression. Conscription was not likely to make any difference, as it would be impossible to coerce the fighting elements in the population.Continuing, Sir Samuel Hoare said that he himself and Sir Henry Dobbs did not for a moment think that Iraq could afford either the men or money needed for an adequate army on modern European lines. He therefore hoped that the Committee would agree to recommend that the Iraq defence forces should be organised on the assumption that adequate air forces existed and that the role of the forces was primarily to maintain internal security, while, perhaps, one mixed brigade might be organised on more Western lines. Lastly, he expressed the hope that this question would be taken up without delay with the Iraq Government. It was already the central subject of debate in that country. None of the many problems now arising could be dealt with until the questions raised in the Oversea Defence Committee Memorandum and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been answered.SIR GEORGE MILNE, referring to paragraph 9 on page 3 in the Oversea Defence Committee Memorandum, stated that it appeared to him extraordinary that General Daly should have offered an opinion as to the role of the Iraq defence forces. He suggested that an outline of the policy should have been given by the High Commissioner to General Daly, and that the latter should then have worked out the necessary military organisation accordingly. If the maintenance of internal security was to be regarded as the main task of the defence forces, he considered that the existing forces were too large and that a kind of gendarmerie should suffice. Finally, he recommended that the Iraq Government should have it made perfectly clear to them that no reliance could be placed on the Imperial troops for enforcing conscription.This latter remark was generally agreed to.Mr. AMERY said that he had not recently discussed the question of Iraq with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Air, but that he was in full accord with the statements just made by them. The existing general defence scheme based on air power had been remarkably successful, and must, in his opinion, continue. If our air forces were now withdrawn it would be impossible for us to refuse to collaborate in the formation of an Iraqi air force. On the other hand, if once the principle is accepted that substantial British air forces will remain, we could agree to Iraq forming air forces within the limits of her finance. He also agreed that the question whether organisation was to be against external offence or for internal purposes was purely academic. No one could for a moment suggest that Iraq was able to defend herself alone against Turkey, or that any army of hers
could act effectively without, our support. Oh the other hand, the suggestion by the Chief of the Imperial Staff that a kind of gendarmerie would -suffice was not practicable, since for.the minor frontier operations in Kurdistan, and for dealing witli Akwan raids, the troops iniist have more of a military organisation which would also serve for external defence as far as its strength went. He reminded the Committee that responsibility for external defence was directly imposed upon.Iraq by the present Treaty.Continuing, Mr. Amery suggested that it was unnecessary to state definitely that the army was organised primarily either for internal order, or external aggression. It only seemed necessary to say &quot; British air forces will remain available, now- equip your army as well as you can for its multifarious duties.&quot; There was one point in General Daly&apos;s scheme, the question of mobility, which he thought had been rather overlooked by the High Commissioner. As to the Chancellor of the Exchequers suggestion for a treaty, or. rather, new Military Agreement, he agreed that an arrangement on these lines, made at the earnest desire of Iraq, was the only practicable solution to the joint problem of Iraqs internal security and British Middle Eastern air requirements. There was one further point which he thought was important, mainly the necessity for avoiding excessive taxation in Iraq. At a recent meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence Sir Claude Schuster had stated that any increase of taxation in the Sudan for defence purposes would defeat its own object. As Sir Henry Dobbs had pointed out, precisely the. same argument applied in Iraq. Therefore, while Iraq must, in principle, after 1928 be financially responsible for her own defence, the treaty should not rigidly exclude all possibility of some further assistance from Great Britain during the period of transition. He recalled the scheme prepared by the Air Ministry which was considered by the Cabinet in 1925. under which contributions from the British Exchequer, varying between  500.000 and  800,000 per annum were to be made between 1928 and 1931. He did-hot for a moment suggest that any contributions on such a scale would be necessary, but he thought that if the Iraq army was to take over the levies, &amp;c, some moderate financial assistance might be necessary after 1928. In this connection he mentioned that the Colonial Office representative had Originally suggested to the Oversea Defence Committee that they should recommend the granting of a subsidy of Rs. 10 lakhs in 1928-29, but this suggestion had been turned down by the Treasury.Mr. CHURCHILL, intervening, said that when the British air scheme for the Middle East became known it would be advisable to transfer the cost of the British air force concerned to the Air Ministry Vote. This would make an immense reduction in the apparent Middle East expenditure.SIR SAMUEL HOARE and Mr. AMERY concurred.Mr. AMERY suggested that when the Middle East Vote shrank to insignificant proportions, the House of Commons would not be likely to object to the continua-tion of small expenditure in connection with the transfer of levies, &amp;o,. to. the Iraq army. He agreed that in making any new arrangements with Iraq, the principle to be adopted should be that Iraq must bear the cost of her own forces together with the difference in cost of locating British Air forces or battalions in Iraq instead of at home. . At the same time, the extra financial assistance necessitated by the transfer already alluded to should not be entirely precluded. Finally, it was most desirable to let the Iraq Government know in the next few days the decisions of the British Government on the points raised by the High Commis-sioner in connection with the reorganisation of the Defences Forces, as, without such decisions, it was impossible to frame any schemes, and owing to the difficulties of the present situation the Minister of Defence had already resigned.&apos; &apos; :SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN stated that he agreed with all that had beeu said on the subject of British air forces in Iraq, and on the role of the Iraq army, but he wished to add a word about external aggression. In his opinion there was at the present time no reason to anticipate any attack by Turkey, Persia or Ibn Saud. The only danger in regard to Turkey Avould arise from frontier incidents which he did not, however, think would lead to Avar. He suggested that we must try and get some arrangement to prevent the present constant stream of complaints from Turkey about British aircraft flying over Turkish territory, and he asked Avhether it Avould [15823-1]        &apos; b 2
not be possible to have a zone five kilometres broad on the Iraq side of the frontier over which flights by aircraft should be forbidden.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD pointed out that there were certain police posts actually on the frontier, and that these during five months or so in the year could only be visited by air.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, continuing, said that in one instance the Turks had stated that a British airman had flown forty kilometres over the frontier, and that a Turkish post had fired on him. He asked whether the posts could not be approached only from our own side before the aircraft came down.LORD BALFOUR enquired whether the posts could not be moved back.SIR SAMUEL HOARE stated that the aeroplanes visiting these posts did not always come down, but merely dropped messages or supplies, and the situation was much the same as on the Indian frontier, where he had visited some outlying posts a couple of weeks ago. The same difficulties had arisen there, but from what he had heard it would be impossible to withdraw the posts without weakening our position. He undertook, however, to do all he could to prevent the recurrence of the incidents complained of by the Turks.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN remarked that the Kurds constituted another source of danger, vis-a-vis Turkey. Everything depended on the extent of control that Iraq could exercise over them. It seemed clear that the Turks are intent on eliminating the Kurds on their side of the frontier, and they are naturally suspicious of those on the Iraq side, which include many refugees from Turkish territory.LORD BALFOUR suggested that one difficulty might arise in connection with the proposed scheme for retaining British air forces in Iraq in the future. Although no military trouble need be anticipated in the Middle East for some years, when it arose it would certainly be general, and our aeroplanes might be required anywhere, either in Egypt, India or Palestine. The Iraq Government might say, with some justification : &quot;We have been paying the extra cost of this Air Force, and though you said we could not expect them to be tied down we certainly hoped that when trouble arose they would be at our disposal. Now, just when we want them, they flyaway.&quot;  .SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that, judging from the discussions on this question that he had in Iraq, it was not likely that the Iraq Government would split hairs in connection with this aspect of the problem.Mr. AMERY suggested that the most likely danger at the present time was Russian aggression towards India, and that in such an event it would be necessary to concentrate our air forces on Russia&apos;s flank in Iraq.Mr. CHURCHILL pointed out that the Iraq Government would be getting considerable value for their payment towards the air forces in the maintenance of internal order.SIR SAMUEL HOARE concurred, and remarked that all responsible people in Iraq were agreed that if the British air forces left the country it would certainly fall into a state of disorder.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there were still two points in the Report that had not been touched on. The first was the suggestion by the Oversea Defence Committee that assistance should be given to the Iraq Government by generous treatment regarding buildings vacated by Imperial troops, and military stores which it was not necessary to remove on the withdrawal of the British forces; and the second was the suggestion that Great Britain should have a recognised right to carry out the naval defence of Iraq and of the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab.Mr. CHURCHILL stated that he agreed to the necessity for our retaining responsibility for the seaward defence of Iraq, but that he wished to make it clear that he would not at present commit himself to agreeing to any expense other than that connected with the location of air forces in Iraq which he had previously referred to. The question of stores and buildings would have to be gone into by the Colonial Office and Treasury.
i     . Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to recommend to the Cabinet -(a.) That for the purpose of maintaining internal order in Iraq adequate air forces must be located in that country, and that in &apos;the interests of Imperial defence in the Middle East it was desirable that these forces should be British.(&amp;.), That the High Commissioner should be advised that internal security should be the primary consideration in deciding on the organization to be adopted for the Iraq Army, but that after the necessary provision for its maintenance has been made, the remaining military resources should be organized with a view to delaying or repelling external aggression. For this purpose a mixed Brigade might be formed in the first instance.(c.) That the Treasury, Colonial Office and Air Ministry should submit for early consideration suggestions for a new agreement with Iraq, to succeed the militazy agreement which terminates in 1928, based on the following principles : (i.) That, at the desire of the Iraq Government, British Air Forces will remain located in Iraq and will be normally at the call of the Government for assisting to maintain internal order. Since, however, these Air Forces are essential to the scheme for British air defence in the Middle East, and, as indicated below, they will be largely maintained at the expense of the British Exchequer, Great Britain must reserve the right to call on them for use elsewhere if and when the need arises, (ii.) That Iraq will, in principle, after 1927-28, assume full financial responsibility for all her own forces, whether land or air, and will bear the extra cost involved in stationing British Air Forces (and any British troops necessary to their protection) in Iraq instead of at home, but that the possibility of obtaining some : small financial assistance from Great Britain during the period of transition should not be precluded without further investigation, (iii.) That Great Britain will have the recognized right to cany out the naval defence of Iraq and of the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab, which, for reasons of oil supply, are of vital importance to the Navy.(d.) That the Treasury, Colonial Office and Air Ministry should enquire into the possibility of assisting to meet the capital expenditure involved in the reorganization of the Defence Forces by generous treatment in the matter of transferring to the Iraq Government buildings vacated by Imperial troops, and military stores which it is not considered necessary1 to remove from the country on the withdrawal of the British forces.******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, February 25, 1927.
