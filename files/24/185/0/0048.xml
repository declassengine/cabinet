Prinked for the Cabinet.   March 1927.SECRET.CABIN ET.CP. 100 (27)Incidence of the Cost of the Indian Mixed Brigade of the Shanghai Defence Force.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.1 circulate for the information of my colleagues a copy of the telegram which, at their request, I addressed to the Viceroy regarding the cost of the Shanghai Defence Force, together with his reply.The saving which, under the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposal, British revenues would make and Indian revenues would sacrifice, is, I am informed, about  26,000 a month. (If he intended to exclude all British formations, and not the two battalions only, the saving is  16,500.) In order to place this charge on Indian revenues not only the assent of my Council, but also Resolutions in both Houses of Parliament, would be necessary. I trust that my colleagues will not press us further in order to obtain so small a gain at the cost of so great political disadvantage.When the legislation for the transfer of the Government of India from the Company to the Crown was before Parliament in 1858, the question of the powers and independence of the Council of India was repeatedly debated. In a speech by Earl Grey in the House of Lords on 29th April 1858 the following passage occurs : &quot; As to the control which Parliament wants to exercise, let me remind your Lordships that the interests of India and of England may sometimes clash. There is a well-known case, that of the Chinese war of 18-1-0, which the East India Company denied was a war undertaken for Indian purposes, and the expenses of which they contended ought to be paid for by this country, and that no part ought to be paid, for out of Indian revenues. Now, is it not very possible that the House of Commons and your Lordships&apos; House might feel tempted to put an undue burden on the people of India for Oriental wars ; and is it not, in order that India may be justly and wisely governed, indispensable that there should be some body call it by what name you please which shall be able to exercise an impartial authority (or perhaps I should call it influence rather than authority), and which shall be able to state the case of India in a manner to^ command attention and insure justice to that country ? &quot;The &quot;impartial authority &quot; to which Lord Grey refers is the Council of India, to which, at that stage of the discussions, it was proposed to give somewhat ineffective powers. I need not remind my colleagues that at a later stage Lord Derby&apos;s Government themselves amended their Bill by giving to Council the statutory veto, although it was clearly pointed out by Lord Granville (House of Lords, 15th July 1858) that if the Council &quot; chose fully to exercise, their powers they could, like the House of Commons, &apos; stop the supplies,&apos; and so put a stop to the proceedings of the Government altogether.&quot;22nd March 1926.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, 17 th March 1927. S58. Private and personal. Very disconcerting discussion took place in Cabinet yesterday on War Office war claims against India of 40 millions and cost of Indian brigade in China. On former, as you will remember, Secretary of State for War and I had arrived at no-payment settlement, but Chancellor of Exchequer refused to agree to this and pressed me to go to arbitration before an arbitrator chosen by myself. I had discussed this with my Council and resisted it strenuously in Cabinet on constitutional and equitable grounds. I had no support except from Peel, Avho when here had found himself in same disagreeable position as I do now. But it was recognised that the constitution creates a deadlock and it was decided on the strong 18S1       100   3.27India Office,BIRKENHEAD.
insistence ol! the Chancellor that, for the present (lie claims should remain unsettled and not be formally wiped out.The Cain net was if possible even more unsympathetic with regard to China. The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed: That the British Exchequer should be responsible for tho whole cost of transport and maintenance of the British battalions of tho Indian Mixed Brigade with the Shanghai Expeditionary Force, as well as the whole cost of the remainder of the Mixed Brigade over and above what India would have paid if the troops had remained in India, the cost to the Indian Government being therefore limited to that of the Indian Mixed Brigade if in India, less that of the two British battalions. I felt bound to resist, this on the grounds above stated and also on the grounds of the smallness of Indian, interests in China, but the Cabinet, instructed me to inform you and my Council, that while recognising that the matter is one in which the final decision must rest with us, they hold strong-view that as a matter ol&apos; equity the Chancellor of the Exchequers proposal was the least share of the cost which India ought to bear.There the matter rests for the present and I shall be glad to have any observations you may wish to make. If you can encourage me in any way to suppose that the wishes of the Cabinet could be met without injurious effect, I should naturally be pleased. If not, it is very important in view ol&apos; the attitude of my colleagues that you should be both, positive and detailed in your reasons.As it is not usual or very desirable to convey the views of the Cabinet as distinct from those of the Secretary of State for India officially to the Government of India, I send this to you personally and leave you to communicate its substance to your Government in whatever way you think proper while safeguarding upon the constitutional side my highly confidential communication to yourself.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, 20th March 1927.164 S. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram dated 17th March, 858. As regards the cost of troops sent to China I can gather from the account you give of the Cabinet discussion the strength of the feeling with which you have to contend, and I would be glad if I could meet their wishes and ease your position. Apart from other considerations I can, of course, appreciate the force of the arguments by which I presume that the suggestion of India contributing is supported. But I am bound to represent to you as strongly as 1 may how serious on the other side would be the difficulties if the suggestion is persisted in.It is true that it has not yet been suggested to the Legislature that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not, in any circumstances, approach Parliament for their consent to charging some portion of the cost to Indian revenues. Immediately after the announcement that troops were being sent from India was made in reply to question in the Assembly, it was stated that no special arrangement had been made because the case was provided for by section 22 of the Government of India Act, the terms of which were given in the answer. The Commander-in-Chiefs statement was to the effect that &quot; the despatch of troops has not only put no burden on India but rather the opposite; money has been saved to India by absence of troops.&quot; Later, in reply to further question consequent upon churchill&apos;s reply to Lansbury in Commons on 4th March&apos;, it was stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government had not raised the question with Government of India.Though these statements do not in strict terms preclude any charge to the revenues of India, the net result of them, taken in conjunction with earlier statements and general practice in the past, has been to create the impression that probability of His Majesty&apos;s Government approaching Parliament for sanction, of a charge was very remote, and public opinion accordingly has not been perturbed.Apart from the Assembly resolution of 28th March 1921, which only speaks of cost in connection with garrison duties, e.g. the Indian battalions stationed at Hong-Kong and Singapore, the entire cost of which, is borne by Imperial Exchequer, other earlier statements which I have iu mind are inter alia the following.On 5th February 1921, Secretary to the Army Department said that it was not a fact that part.of the British garrisons in India was maintained for Imperial purposes. On 16th February 1926, in course of sustained cross-examination in Assembly, he said that, portions of Army in India had at times been lent to His Majestya Government, and that when the Army in India is employed for other than Indian purposes, it is maintained at expense of English taxpayer.   This statement was made
twice. On 26tli February last, Secretary to the Army Department&apos; summarised these past announcements, and stated that the position there defined was still the position, of Government of India.The above statements could not, of course, override final and implicit authority of .1 Iis Majesty&apos;s Government if they chose to exercise it under section 22, and ought strictly to have been associated with explicit reference to that provision. But they do represent what has been and is both past and present practice.The troops retained in Iraq and Palestine after the war were financed entirely from Imperial revenues. The garrisons at Hong Kong and Singapore already referred to are also so financed. The only exceptions in. recent times have been about 70 men all told, who were lent from the Indian Army to serve on Consulate guard and escort duties in Persia and Gulf, and battalions doing duty in Persian Gulf. The latter no longer exist. The cost of above troops has always been shared equally between Home and Indian Governments on ground that their services were for the benefit of India as well as Great Britain.In view of the statements and practice I do not, therefore, think it will be held to have been an unreasonable assumption by Government of India and Legislature that His Majesty&apos;s Government would bear full cost of the Indian contingent. When we were urgently asked to send troops we did consider the point in Council, but, for reasons I have given, did not think it necessary or indeed, in view of the urgency, possible or proper to raise it.There would have been very much more serious trouble in the Legislature here but for the reassuring effect of the pronouncement about section 22, Government of India Act, which the public considered, rightly or wrongly, would not be resorted to in such a case. In so far as the claim is pressed against us on grounds of equity, it might perhaps have been possible, when the subject first came into publicity, that India should contribute on the basis the Chancellor suggests. But if now, after the announcement of sending- troops had been made on the first day of the Session, it is stated within a few days of its close that India is to contribute towards an expedition to which Indian political opinion is strongly opposed, we shall be charged with breach of faith and something like sharp practice, for having misled them for several weeks by smooth statements, and deferred telling the truth till we had got through difficult and critical session.I think that the-effect would be very damaging and would hopelessly prejudice chance both of getting any sane discussion here on the general Army policy, and also any chance of inducing India gradually to be willing to take an increasing share of Imperial obligations and burdens.It has, moreover, been emphasised frequently by Government in the last few years that the Army in India is barely sufficient for Indian needs, and that if any portion of it, at a time of quiet in India, is lent for external purposes, the understanding is that the troops will be instantly recalled or replaced in India if the need for them arose. India is thus definitely doing without a part of her essential defence system at some risk to her safety. It can be reasonably argued, therefore, that she should not have to pay in addition. It is not as if India were boarding out her surplus troops at the expense of the British taxpayer. Although in my speech to the Assembly on the 24th January I said that the mercantile communities included many Indian subjects, the most recent information which we have obtained shows that the number of British Indians in Shanghai, including police, is about 1,400, and the estimated value of property roughly  100,000.Lastly, the benefit to the Imperial Exchequer if India contributed the cost of the Indian units on the scale which she would bear if those troops were maintained on a peace footing in India is inconsiderable. It is estimated approximately that an Indian Infantry battalion costs rather less than half a lakh a month. There are two of these and one company of Sappers and Miners, and various ancillary details, the total cost of which is not likely to exceed 1-1- lakhs a month. It seems most unwise to raise difficult political and constitutional issues and stir up widespread agitation for the sake of such a sum. Another point possibly worth considering is this. The passage of the Indian Navy Bill through the House of Commons has been attended by a great deal of carping criticism in the Indian Press, which was echoed also in the recent debate on the Army Department grant. It is in particular contended that the Indian Navy should not be used for Imperial purposes without the consent of the Legislature. Under the draft Bill it cannot be so used without the consent of the Governor-General in Council in an emergency.
But public opinion is very touchy on this subject and definitely connects the possible employment of the Navy for no strictly Indian purposes with the question of&quot; similar employment of Army. It, may Lie confidently anticipated that, if Indian revenues are charged, against wishes of Assembly with part of cost of Shanghai Defence Force, the Indian Navy Bill will either be thrown out of Assembly on &quot;that ground, or amended in the sense of saying that consent of Assembly must be obtained before Indian Navy can be employed for general Imperial purposes. There is likely to be considerable difficulty in getting the Bill through in any case.- I hope this may help you to persuade the Chancellor and the Cabinet not to press us. The question here is so much one of psychology and atmosphere that I am not sure I shall have succeeded in conveying it accurately to you, but I trust that I shall have satisfied you of the real difficulty proposal would create for us.I have consulted my Council and this represents their strongly held and unanimous view.I should be grateful for very early decision, as we have promised to give Assembly positive information on question of cost, before the close of this Session,. i.e. on or before 26th March.
