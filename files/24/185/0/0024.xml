CONFIDENTIAL. COAL.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said he was sure the Council would have seen with the sincerest sympathy the accounts which had appeared in the newspapers - which he was afraid were only too true - of the magnitude of the mine disasters in V/ales and Nottinghamshire.   The Council would wish to express their sympathy with the &quot;bereaved and their admiration for the extra-ordinary gallantry which had been displayed In the rescue work at the Ebbw Vale Pit^,SIR ADAM NIMMO, as representing the coal industry, desired to identify himself in a special sense with the President s observations regarding these two distressing colliery accidents. They were very much to be deplored, and all who were associated with the Industry - would feel the warmest sympathy with those who had suffered loss through them.Turning to the industry itself,  it appeared that, speaking generally, the outstanding feature was the rapidity with which it had settled down.   The figures of output which were on the Council table showed that we had practically come back now to the average of March, 1926.   As a matter of fact, some of the figures in Sir A. Nimmo&apos;s possession appeared to show that we were in a rather better position at the present moment in respect of output than we had been, taking March 1926 as an index month.   He agreed with the remarks that had been made by Mr. Bond (see Section of these Notes on &quot;Iron and Steel&quot;) with regard to the difficulties of transport.   He had referred to them specially at the last meeting of the Council, but. had then pointed out that, or course, the railway companies had been greatly hampered by the considerable quantity of coal that had been coming into the country.   During last January we had imported nearly 2 million tons of coal, and of course we must recognise that such an importation was -bound to create very considerable difficulties for the railway companies. Traders were all hoping that with the cutting off entirely of foreign coal, and the settling down of the railway companies to dealing with our own traffic, there would be an increasing improve-ment, which indeed was very much required.As regards the output per person employed in the industry per week, if we took the average of March,1926, as 100, the output per person employed for the week ending February 12th, 1927, worked out at 110.3, which clearly showed that the industry was working on a relatively much more efficient basis than it did, and that we ought to be in a position to supply relatively cheap coal to the other industries of the country upon which we all so largely depended.    The export position was rapidly improving.    In December we exported only 1,608,000 tons, whereas for the month of January we exported 4,092,000 odd tons;    and in two of the large exporting districts - the Bristol Channel and the North-East Coast ports, -during the week ending. February 12th,  the exports considerably exceeded the weekly average of March, 1926 .
COAL (Contd.).In regard to unemployment, Sir A. Nimmo had mentioned at the last Council meeting that the industry vrere getting out certain figures for themselves in an endeavour to determine the position, as far as they possibly could, in the comparative-ly near future.    Mr. Phillips had. given figures (see Section on &quot;Employment&quot;) showing an unemployment total of 200,000 men. It seemed to be clear that that number of persons could not be re-employed In the coal industry.   The figures, which the industry had, gave an Indication that they were likely to be able to absorb an additional 40.0C0 to 50,000 men.    If they were to bring output up to what it had been in 1915 - and the Board of Trade figures showed that they were producing now about half a million tons per week less than they had been in 1915 - Sir A. Nimmo thought, personally,  that the Industry could get back to that pre-war output with probably not more than about 50,000 additional men, because the collieries were adapting themselves very rapidly to further mechanical methods, and in the comparatively near future would be able to produce a larger output, although employing a less number of men.    Accord-ingly, even if they brought back the output of coal to what it had been in 1915, they would still be leaving 150,000 men out of employment as compared with the numbers employed in 1915.    Now if those figures were approximately accurate,. - and he thought they were approximately so, - there was a problem which was not going to be solved in the coal industry itself.    There was no doubt - turning again to the   general coal position - that in the coal industry at the moment there was not enough trade to keep the whole of the collieries going.    In some districts the position was worse than in others.    The solution lay in the possibility of expanding the export trade, and although we might have difficulty in getting our figures very substantially increased in the immediate future,  those figures, as time went on, would show a steady expansion.IRON AND STEEL.MR. BOND observed that there was an inevitable delay in getting the steel works into operation after the strike.   They had to warm up the coke ovens, many of which had got into a bad state of repair, and it was the same with regard to the blast furnaces.    The number of blast furnaces working had increased to 152, and there were more in operation at the end of January than in April last.    There was still a shortage of pig iron in this country, so that it might be taken that that number of blast furnaces would be still further increased.    The production of pig iron in January last was less, however,  than in April, 1926, because the blast furnaces had not got   into full working.
IRON AND STBBL (Contd.).The production   of steel in January was 730,000 tons, as compared with over 600,000 tons in April last, and February would probably show a considerable increase over the January figures.    There had been a considerable import of iron and steel in January, partly, no doubt, because, in order to get the finishing departments going and to keep them going during the strike, we had had to contract for a great deal of foreign steel.    In January these Imports had been 219,000 tons as against 114,000 tons in April.    The steel works all over the country were fairly well employed, so far as they could get hold of the short supplies of pig iron, and the price of pig iron was some 12/1 higher than before the strike, - the higher price of the British article being largely due to the increased price of coke, which was about 5/- a ton dearer than it had been before the strike.    That again was partly due to the collieries not working full time, and - in some districts at any rate - the collieries were not working full time because of the chaotic condition of the railways.    The railway companies did not seem to be able to handle the traffic.    In the big finishing depart-ments were included the galvanised^sheeting and tinplate industries, which consumed some 25x of the steels produced in this country.    These were all busy.    In South &apos;.&apos;;&quot;ales every single tinplate works was operating, and the production was larger than it had been for some years, - probably at  the rate of about one million tons a year.    But both the galvanised sheet industry and the tinplate industry were up against immense competition from the United States and Germany for the export trade, and in France they were producing most of the tinplates which they consumed.    There had been an interesting event in India,  the Indian Government having given British makers a lower tariff on steel than they had imposed on makers in other countries.    This was believed to be because of the superior quality of British steel, and it might lead to quite important developments.    It was not at all certain at present that the American iron and steel industry was going to be so active this year as it was last year.In our own tinplate and sheet industry orders were coming along.    It was true that there had. been a large accumulation of orders at the end of the strike, but new orders were being obtained,  though It was a little early yet to judge what the future was going to be.    Mr. Bond saw no Indications yet, however,  that we were not going to continue busy up to the end of the year.With reference to the European Steel Pact, the British trade, as was well known, received an invitation to ^oln the Pact.    The reason why they had not done so was mainly that an agreement could not be reached as regards their allocation. They had asked for an allocation based on their output of March last year - 9-g million tons - amid the Pact had only been able to allocate them Sg- million tons.    It was felt to be hopeless to go to the steel industry in this country and offer them an allocation of S-g- million tons;    and, as would have been seen,
IRON AND STEEL (Contd.).during the first three months of the agreement the German makers had had to pay no less than  500.000 into the pool, in respect of over-production, and they were very dissatisfied.&apos; There was some inside agreement that there should not be a transfer of that large sum of money all at once, but the Germans would eventually pay It.   There was also some talk of a change In the arrangement and of France drawing out.   Belgium had already done so.STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR wrote&quot;There has been a general Improvement in Sheffield.   Orders are coming In nicely, but we are still short of heavy steel billets, and this is hampering the expansion of our export trade, although ,1 think there is every prospect that the total March figures will show up very well indeed.    I am not sure whether we shall beat last March, as that was one of the best months for export trade, which this district has ever had, outside the war years.    I hope to come to the next meeting and make a report on conditions in Germany, Denmark, France, etc.&quot;NON-FERROUS METALS. THE BRITISH METAL CORPORATION wrote:-&quot;The past month has shown a general improvement in the non-ferrous metal market and prices have in all cases risen fairly steadily throughout the period.    Coppere lead and spelter have received considerable impetus from statements made in America that production was to be curtailed.   We believe that the American Smelting and Refining Company are reducing their output of Mexican lead by 15% and the Anaconda and Kennett Copper Companies their productions by a like amount.&quot;These bull features have been further assisted by an improved demand for all metals from Germany and Russia,, while -as seemed probable when we last wrote - consumers In the United Kingdom have bought more freely in anticipations of better general trade which seem likely at present to be realised.&quot;Tin also closes at the highest point reached for some months.   America still seems to require this metal on the same large scale, and as we have now reached a season of the year when Straits shipments are small, it is not unlikely that prices may go higher.
NON-FERROUS METALS  (Contd.).&quot;Our reports which we receive weekly from all the principal centres seem to indicate a general improvement in the trades consuming non-ferrous metals with the possible exception of cables which seem at present to be a little quiet.    If the American curtailments referred to above are carried out to the letter we should expect prices of non-ferrous metals to be maintained at approximately present levels for the time being, with a possibility of some further improvement later in the year,&quot;ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.SIR PHILIP NASH stated that the electrical trades during the last month had been fairly good.    The actual volume of business placed showed no great change, but undoubtedly during the last month increased Inquiries had been made, -and mostly for home business, which was a good sign.    There was considerable activity in the London area and an increased activity in the Newcastle and Glasgow districts.    Export business remained pretty good,  and there seemed to be no reason why that should not continue-    Probably Australia would not be quite so good a market as during last year because they seemed rather to have over-bought in electrical work, but the demand from other countries looked to be quite good.    Competition abroad remained just about the same and prices much about the same, but the volume of work which was coming to this country in proportion to the total volume available seemed quite satisfactory.COTTON.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN wrote:-&quot;In both the Spinning and the Manufacturing Sections of the trade considerably more business has been done during the last few days of January and throughout February. In the American Spinning Section,  although a considerable amount of short-time is still being worked, it is very satisfactory to note that during the past six weeks Spinners have sold rather more than their normal production of yarn.    The increase In  -sales of yarn has enabled Spinners to get rather better prices,  and,  although prices are not yet sufficiently good to cover cost in all cases,  the margin of spinners&apos; losses has certainly been reduced and trade looks considerably brighter. In tho Egyptian section of the spinning trade, trade has been rather quiet and the margins have not boen satisfactory, but spinners have run full time.
CONFIDENTIAL. COTTON (Contd.) .&quot;in the Weaving section of the trade many more looms have been re-started.    Orders have been corning forward much more freely and substantial business continues to be done in piece goods, especially for India.    The China market, as can only be expected,  is still very bad,,    It is estimated that the weaving production js now somewhere in the neighbourhood of 75  of fall production, and a large number of looms which have been stopped for e long period are gradually getting to work.&quot;On the whole, I am pleased to be able to report a decided improvement in the cotton trade, although we have still a considerable way to go before the trade is on the basis of prosperity.&quot;SIR W.  CLARE LEES observed that the improvement in the Lancashire trade indicated at the last meeting of the Council had been fully maintained during the past month.    There was no doubt that the position was very much better than it had been. - It was better in volume,  and Sir William was given to understand that it was better in margin,   and that there was more likelihood of a general basis of profit than there had been.    The only drawback to that improvement was that it came very largely from India.    We wanted it from India of course, but we preferred that it should be world-wide in its movement.    On the other hand there were indications that it was likely to become wider spread.South America had been very disappointing, but payments and remittances from South: America were good,  and we had always found that that was the first step towards creating -a good atmosphere for the next buy.    Morocco was doing a little more,  and Java   continued to be quite good.Following up his observations of last month, when he suggested that Asia was the real cause c.f worry in our cotton trade, Sir W. Clare Lees handed in another table which, he thought, minht complete the picture.    The first column in that statement contained the 1913 figures; in the second column he had reduced these by 15c/o to show what we might call our expectancy from each of the markets, -the 15% to compensate for 103S of hours;  the third column showed the relative importance of each market expressed in percentages;  and in the noxt three he had shown the 192 5 position as it had developed by then.    From this statement it would be observed,  that, if the losses in India,  China and Japan were eliminated, &quot;the rest of the world would approximate-ly have kept us going at full time so far as their share was concerned.    If our losses in India,  Japan and China had only been proportional to our losses in the rest of the world, we should have been - roughly speaking - working full time. Those figures were a good deal modified in 1936,  but that was not a very useful year for comparative purposes.    The Balkans and the Near East fell in 1926 to a proportion of 54 as against, .the figure of 106 given in the table.    There was no roason, however, why the figure should not come back to i-os former level.    It probably did not represent a loss in a permanent form at all.    The table could be kept up to date.
COTTON  (Oontd.)In reply to an inquiry by the President,  Sir W. Clare Lees said that a cotton trade statistical department was being started at Manchester.As regards the suggested Yarn Price Fixing Association,  it was reported that an adherence of something like 75% of the spindles had been promised; but it was probably too early to speak of its formation or operations at present.    The market had stiffened considerably during the last few weeks; and if the price of cotton stayed where it was then for the first time for some years the buyers abroad would have a visible profit in their hands,  and this was most desirable.    The advance was-all in our favour, as long as it could be held.    It was to&apos; be feared, however,  that if it went much further we would have a fall back again..   SIB W.

WOOL.MR. ARTHUR SHAW was glad to report that,  in the woollen trade of the West Riding, during the last month, there had certainly been a change in the right direction, and he was satisfied that, although of course there was no question of a boom, it represented a steady improvement in the trade. This perhaps applied particularly to the Bradford trade.    In the Halifax area, it seemed to bo more particularly the spinning side that had improved, as compared with the manufacturing. The main portion of the manufacture in the Halifax district appeared to be on the light goods, and the Improvement was not so great.    In the heavy woollen districts the position was peculiar; one would have expected the same tendency to be evident in the various areas.    On the contrary, however, in the Dewsbury district, which was a centre for sections of work such as the spinning and manufacturing of cloth and blankets, whilst the cloth side was satisfactory,  the work on blankets was in a bad&apos; situation, and the percentage of unemployment was keeping very high.    On the other hand, in Batley, where there was mainly the manufacturing of cloth, .it was found that there was a steady improvement, steady but sure,   aid the figures of unemployment were coming down fairly rapidly.Mr. Shaw handed in figures of unemployment which had been received from three districts, and could be taken as typical of those districts as a whole, but were not necessarily similar to the figures published by the Ministry of Labour.   They represented about 60% of the industry, and showed that, in the worsted and woollen trades of Bradford and Huddersfield, a steady improvement had occurred during the last three months, but that in the heavy woollen districts the unemployment remained very serious.   There was no doubt some truth in the suggestion which had been made that figures, whether Government or other, relating to unemployment in these trades did not give a completely accurate   picture, because numbers of people had left the industry, and the figures only referred to the progressively decreasing numbers that were left.   Some said that in the wool textile trade there was a depletion almost to 60 f of its former producing capacity.    Mr. Shaw was not prepared to accept so large a figure as that as necessarily correct; he thought, indeed,  that during the last two or three years there had not been much change&apos; in the numbers employed in the industry.A cloud was unfortunately hovering over the textile trade at the present moment.   The relationship at the moment between the employers and the operatives in the  dyeing industry was not just at its best,  aid notices had been given to terminate agreements.   It was possible that if no satisfactory arrangement was made, within two months1  time, the export trade might be seriously affected very soon so far as Lancashire was concerned, and soon afterwards the woollen trade.    It was to be hoped that the  difficulty would be overcome.

The movement of wool values had been distinctly upwards in the last two months, and the tendency was continuing.   There was a very strong demand for wool from all over the world.   It was interesting to note that the total exports of wool from Australasia since July 1st to the present date were more than 200,000 bales less than last year..   Taking it at  30 per bale, that would be six millions sterling less strain on the financing of lifting that clip, which was of course a seasonal one and threw a heavy financial strain on the importing nations of the world.   Therefore it was right to assume that a decline in prices, together with the decline in the volume, had reduced the financial strain and brought it probably within even the reduced resources of firms operating throughout the world who had suffered so much as the result of the losses of the last two years.   That led one to expect that the future tendency of wool values might not be downwards but upwards, and with Increasing values it was probable that employment would improve.Continental countries had been buying wool very strongly. The European wool consumption was probably much higher than it had been a year ago, very much higher than during the last few years.    But the American consumption of imported&apos;wool was tending downwards, no doubt as the result of their tariff.    It had become evident that the high tariff was reducing the wool consumption per capita in the United States. Japan was buying wool very hoavily, and it was a notable fact that Russia had been making very much larger Imports in tho last two months.   As to tho possibility of our bning left short of wool, owing to heavy purchases by foreign countries, our not retained imports in this country wcro considerably higher than our current consumption, and it might bo assumod that our future needs would bo provided for.
inWOOL  (Contd .) .On the question of statistics, there was a distinct difference of opinion in the industry whether statistics should be given on a voluntary or a statutory basis.   The wool textile trade in France had put definitely on record that they were against compulsory statistical information, and this attitude, if maintained, would probably preclude effect being given to the suggestion that there should be simultaneous action by all the leading wool-importing countries.   But at Roubaix the manufacturers were grouped into different categories,  and each of these supplied voluntarily to a central office figures as to the total deliveries for the week,  the production, stocks and unfilled contracts converted into loom-hours.   Note had been taken in the wool textile trade of the setting up of a  statistical bureau in the  cotton trade,  and an endeavour would be made to get the question   o1 l3cussed in Bradford of corresponding action being taken there,   It would appear, however, to be less important to get, for instance, the actual volume of stocks of wool tops, than to get indica-tions which would show tendencies and from which deductions could be made.    The actual stocks were of less Importance because the figures of stocks could be juggled with, but there would be many employers prepared to give voluntarily information which would form the basis from which tendencies could be deduced.Turning to Mr. Shaw&apos;s figures,  whilst they.were unquestionably correct, it had been calculated that in the last five or six years the numbers employed in the wool textile industry had fallen by 45 , 000 or 17The figures of our export trade and the employment figures coincided as to their tendencies, since we were doing less of the world&apos;s business in wool textiles, and the total wool production of the world that passed through our works was declining as compared with the production of other countries of the world. As to the fact that In this country we maintained a higher ratio of wool consumption than other countries, Col.Willey thought it should be borne in mind that consumption in America, which amounted to about 600 million yards before the war, had probably dropped by about 150 millions; and It seemed as if that balance of consumption had gone into Europe, because the imports of wool textiles for January intOv this country were 3-jV million square yards, as against 2-g-million square yards in January last year - an increase of practically 35$ which showed the competition we were suffering as the result of cheaper production in France. This competition was assisted by the lower level of both wages and taxes which they had to pay.   Nevertheless, orders were coming in better here; wool was buoyant because prices were rising,  tops were active, and yarn was a little better. There was a distinct difference between the men&apos;s wear and women&apos;s dress goods; in men s wear employment was good, while in dross goods it was bad.    In general, prospects were distinctly improving.
ARTIFICIAL SILK.MR. ADDISON considered that the volume of business done in the first two months of the year might be regarded as quite satisfactory, and that,  in view of the improved conditions in Lancashire and Yorkshire,  we might look to a gradual Improvement in trade.     The hosiery trade still continued very good in Leicester and Nottingham;  but the Leek and Macclesfield districts were still under a cloud, chiefly, perhaps, because of a change of fashion.     They had a considerable flow of work while the jumper was popular, but that was done with now. The export trade continued quite steady, and Australia was still a very good customer.     As regards our European competitors, after successfully flooding the Eastern markets they seemed to have cried a   halt, and new to be rather concentrating,on South America where our own people found business very difficult to get.     Taking a survey of the industry as a whole, we were not particularly pessimistic.POTTERY.MR. ROLL INS was glad to be able to report that the improve-ment which it was thought       would take place last month seemed to be continuing.     There was a further decline in the trade&apos;s unemployment figures - a remarkable one last month, which was still being maintained; and there was a marked Improvement throughout all the sections of the pottery industry.    In particular, an Improvement was noticeable in the export trade, especially to the United States of America.,      J-t was understood that the increases In fuel prices had now been entirely removed.The future outlook might be indicated best by the fact that, from the 25th March next, wages would be stabilised in the industry for twelve months, for the third year in succession; that seemed to be an indication that they were looking forward to a good year, and the indications in general pointed in that direction.RUBBER.MR. JOHNSTON wrote :-&quot;The expected improvement in trade till fails to materialise so far as this industry generally is concerned. There are, however,  indications that greater activity is likely to develop in the Immediate future.
inRUBBER (CONTD.)&quot;The general mechanical rubber trade may be almost taken as an index or general   trade activity as it supplies requisites of one kind and  another for almost every industry in the country, and while actual orders are still poor, there Is an indication of increased activity ahead which is reassuring.     This indication chiefly takes the form of large numbers of enquiries for goods used for engineering and general mechanical purposes which it is hoped will soon be translated into orders.&quot;As regards the tyre trade, the situation is still as. unfortunate as before.     tPhe w ar in prices continues and there is no immediate indication of any upward trend which could only be brought about by agreement between the large international interests involved in this trade.      In the meantime the tyre business, both at home and for export, Is being undertaken at prxoes which do not much more than cover prime cost of material and labour.&apos;*In the Rubber footwear business, unsuitable seasonal conditions continue to prejudicially affect this branch. Foreign competition is also becoming increasingly acube in all sections.&quot;The uncertainty as to the cost of the crude rubber market has also an unsettling effect on the trade generally.&quot;GENERAL ?RADE.SIR STANLEY MA CHIN had little to add to what he had said at the Council&apos;s previous meeting.     The improved outlook was continuing, but it was developing very slowly.      Orders were coming in fairly well both for the home market and for export, but still we had a good deal of way to make up before we could consider ourselvos in anything like a normal condition. Reports received regarding the British Industries Fair in London certainly showed&quot; that there were a very large number of prospective buyers about,  and It would seem really that in the near future we might look for a substantial increase In our Trade Returns as .compared with last year.     The President observed that buyers were very satisfied with the Birmingham Fair also.As regards France, Sir S. Machin gathered, at another recent visit he had made there, that employers were feeling the altered state of the exchange very materially now, and it would appear that some of their industries were already suffering from other countries competition.      Sir Stanley fs own branches of trade were feeling they could not compete with this country in the way they had been competing a few months ago.      It was t o be hoped we might again be in a position to export to that market Then the readjustment which was taking place there was completed.
GENERAL TRADE (Contd.)MR. VYLE said that the general feeling seemed to be that February had been a month of disappointment; we were looking forward to better things, but it had been extraordinarily flat.     There had certainly been some improvement, but nothing like what was expected.     The trouble seemed to lie In the heavy trades, which had not got moving.     There was not a sufficient supply of manufactured steel, and there still seemed to be a shortage of coke.    It was said that this would be overcome in time,  but that was what w e had luard a month ago, and it had not  come to pass.The report from the Chamber of Commerce at Greenock stated, as aid their previous report, that as soon as more steel was available manufacturers would be able to take more men into employment.      The sugar industry there was still depressed, . and it had been extremely difficult during the month to make sales.    $here   were heavy stocks of unsold refined sugar.In Leicester, the boot business was fairly satisfactory, although they wanted more orders and stated that there was room for improvement.    In hosiery they were hoping for better things now that the wholesalers and the retailers had cleared their stocks.In Nottingham, too, the hosiery prospects had not materialised quite in the way that they had hoped.    They complained that artificial silk was being sadly neglected. Lace was in a more hopeful situation.In the v7i.dnes district the figures for unemployment were the lowest during the past three years,which was rather encouraging.With regard to timber at Liverpool, they had had a set-back.    Their stocks were short, and the timber trade was looking forward to better times, which, however, had not yet arrived.      In leather and hides the month of February had been a very dull one.     However, throughout trade generally, optimism was still expressed.MR. DEBENHAM observed that it was difficult to get a good view of the general purchasing power of the country, because there were perhaps not quite the same friendly relations between people engaged in the distributing trades as there were in the big manufacturing trades.       As far as could be seen, however, the strike had very materially affected trade in general^ but more so in rhe provinces than in London, and perhaps more so in the lower end, and in quite the best end, than In the intermediate.       Probably the wholesale trade had been much mor9 affected than the retail, and In consequence stocks were depleted generally through-out the country.     This would afford a better prospect for manufacturers during the current year.       There appeared
GENERAL TRADE (Contd.)to &quot;be signs that the cotton trade would be better than the silk or the woollen;    and probably the woollen better than the silk.     This was attributable to changes of fashion; there was more demand this year for cotton goods, printed or mixed with artificial silk.       There were also signs, Mr, Debenham thought, that French competition was very much less - German was already less than it had been a few years ago when their currency was in a different position; but even in France it was now found that French goods did not compete to the same degree with ours&apos; as they did.    It was still difficult, however, to do much trade with France.MR. HAYHURST wrote  -&apos; Co-operative Wholesale Society Report.&quot;Grocery and Provisions.      I am pleased to be in the position of reporting increasing business in the grocery and provision trade as compared with the corresponding period of last year.      In one section of the country there has been a slight decrease, which is due primarily to the slackness in the iron and steel industry - one       the mainstays of that particular district.    This small decrease, has, however, been-easily absorbed in the increases shown over the rest of the country.&quot;Coal.    Sales show slight increase over last year. This is somewhat gratifying as business is found to be fairly difficult, owing to pit owners being uncertain as to prices and competition of various collieries.&quot;Drapery. This covers a very wide area - as we include millinery, haberdashery, fancies, hosiery and heavy woollens under this head.    Decreases are recorded in almost every section.    Probably the state of the trade of the country finds its reflection earliest in this particular business, and there is no doubt whatever that the general depression of trade is solely accountable for the decreases I have to mention.    To some extent several departments included hereunder may be looked upon as &quot;semi-luxury&quot; departments, and only those goods which necessity compels have been able to find a purchaser.    In the one or two instances where slight increases are reported one is inclined from the nature of their sales to the belief that they are purchased in preparation for Spring trade. Generally speaking, buyers appear to be holding aloof for the time being in anticipation of the general trade revival we are all looking forward to.&quot;Boot and Shoe Trade.      Shows slight increases, taking the country as a whole.    Sellers anticipate good sales for Spring and Summer styles.
il9GENERAL TRADE (Contd.)&quot;Furniture, Furnishing and Hardware.      These sectionr are maintaining their trade and call for no special feature.    The fact that I can record fairly steady salep, of Furniture, which is a trade not comparable in any way with either Grocery, Drapery or Boots is noteworthy.    In all these sections sellers are looking forward to keeping business, even if no extraordinary increases result.&quot;General.    Taking the whole of the business, we have reason to feel satisfied.&apos; The tone seemed to be bright and cheerful; and, if there was no industrial upheaval in the Country, there seemed reason to believe that the prospect of increased business would be realised.&quot;Tea.    The market during the last several weeks has shown an advance over all types and in particular on common and medium kinds.    The advance during the last fortnight has been up to 1-gri.per lb. the best tea is also firmer and dearer.&quot;Coffee.    Larger quantities of types are being offered at the London Auction, and there has been a good demand for fine qualities at steady rates.    The lower descriptions of Coffee have been plentiful and they only commanded low prices.&quot;Cocoa.    There has been little increase in consumption since 1923 whether of Cocoa or Chocolate, and this year shows no sign of improvement.    The price of the raw material on the Gold Coast is giving alarm, prices having risen from about 44/- per cwt. last year to about SO/- per cwt.  this year for the good quality raw bean&quot;.GENERAL TRADE AND FINANCE.MR. BRAND observed that in L-ndon the money market was feeling the effects of the collection of the income tax, and of other influences which were still, no doubt, to be regarded as results of the coal strike.    All idea of a fall in the Bank Rate had, of course, disappeared, and coal strike effects were still, probably, being shown in the weakness of the New York Exchange.    The Bank of England was not, as it should be at this time    of the year, collecting a good deal of gold, but was still lettL gold out.    Our money rates were higher than those on the Continent;    the Amsterdam, New York, Berlin and Switzerland rates were all lower than our own.
GENERAL TRADE AND FINANCE (Contd.)It was difficult to say whether interest rates in general were coming down.    So far as this country was concerned, with our increased consumption, there was ho reason why they should.    On the other hand, there was one big influence in the other direction, namely that, last year, Germany had been borrowing from America very large sums of money, but appeared to be practically satisfied now.    There would probably be but few German issues abroad. On the other hand, the American investment market was stronger than ever and had enormous sums to lend abroad; and the question was where would she lend them, and was she going to bring down or influence money rates all over the world?    The American investor a few years ago would not look at any foreign issue, but he would now take foreign issues which the British investor would not take. If we v:ent on in the way we were going now, we should, in the issuing market of the world, become a sort of larger Amsterdam, as compared with America.    With a really big issue, perhaps 20 million dollars could be placed in America, 5 million here, 3 million in Amsterdam and 2 million in Switzerland - that was the sort of proportion it had come to; but no doubt we should recover.    In America, as far as we could learn, all the indications were pointing to renewed development and prosperity; there was no sign that things were going to be less good in 1927 than they were in 1926;    everyone was expecting them to be at least as good.As to the French situation, everyone gathered from the newspapers that II. Poincare apparently did not intend to have stabilisation at present;    and therefore, while it might be very unlikely the rate of exchange would go better, it was always possible that it would go worse. The Belgian stabilisation scheme seemed now likely to be quite successful, unless there were tremendous depreciation in the French exchange.      In that case it would be hard to say quite what effect this would have on 3elgium.    The Germans were now financing themselves largely.    All the German banks had had from America and England about four times the amount of credit they were able to use.    They were in no need for further credits;    they had much too much in fact, and were making very little use of them.MR. CURRIS said that the   Bill rate in this country had been rather lower than was expected, probably due to the foreign demand for Sills.    The feeling on the Stock Exchange   had been, on the whole, very cheerful. Considering the events in China, it was remarkable that prices of stocks were as well maintained as they had been.
SHIPPING.MR. ALEXANDER SHAW sent in the following figures:-index Number of Shipping Freights.The Index Number fell from 46.48 in November 1928, to 33.10 in December, a drop of 29$,  and to 30.36 in January 1927, a further drop of 8.3$&amp;.    The effects of the temporary boom have thus been completely wiped out, but some of the increase in costs resulting from the strike still remains.   3unker coal, for example, is dearer than before the strike.    The January Index Numbers laave been:-1920 s 100. 1913 s 100.January 1927................ 30.36 129.74January 1926................ 25.01 106.88Laid up   Tonnage.

CONFXD..-NT IAL.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.MR. HURCOMB said that  as the tonnage figures of merchandise carried by the railways in December related to a period when the effects of the strike were still being felt, their details were not of much current interest.As regards receipts, during the first seven weeks of the present year, the goods receipts were  350,000   better for the four railway groups than for the corresponding period last year;.     This year3s figures were to some extent affected by the Increase in rates, which took effect on 1st february,      Passenger receipts, however, were not so encouraging, being about  335^000 less than in the corresponding period of last year.     That was no doubt partly due to the fact that people had less money to spend on travel, and the decrease was distributed over all four groups,EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS observed that during February the figures relating to unemployment continued to decrease with some rapidity.     On 21st February the total amounted to 1,196,100, or over 150,000 less than on the 24th January, and nearly 300,000 less than the highest figure at the beginning of January.     Thai; fall had not been confined to the temporarily unemployed,  bat had taken place largely,  in fact to a rather greater extent, amongst those who had been wholly unemployed-Although the present total was still about 70,000 above the corresponding figure for last year , we had &quot;perhaps reason, in the circumstances to be fairly well satisfied with it.Referring to th9 total in respect of miners mentioned at the last meeting, the actual figure at the end of January had worked out at just over 200,000 miners unemployed - rather more than had been anticipated,- and of those nearly 150,000 were recorded as wholly unemployed a     Mr. Phillips put in a table shewing the distribution of those figures over the various areas at 24th January lasto     As would be seen, the highest ratios of unemployment were in Wales and Monmouth,-just over 27 per cent; and in Durham, - just over 25 per cent; while the lowest were in Notts, Leicester and Warwick -about 4 per cent.

AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON observed that at the last meeting of the Council he had pointed out that at this time of the year attention in Australia was bent upon the rains, which were really the factor that counted.    Very heavy falls, of from 15 to over 50 inches, had occured on the north and south coasts of Queensland,  and in the north east of New South Wales,  and from six to ten inches in the Northern Territory. Only light showers were reported from the more southerly districts and from West Australia.    There was a satisfactory report that the rabbits had been disappearing in the southern part of New South Wales, where they were regarded as a groat menace to the pastor.aJ  industry.    They had been dying in&apos;millions owing to the heat.A considerable shortage in the dried and canned fruit crop was expected, owiDg to the occurrence of various pests. An important feature about the wheat crop,  the harvesting .of which had now been practically finished, was that they were expecting 165 million bushels, which was second only to the record year of 1915.  and would be the best crop since that date.INDIAN TRADE.MR. LINDSAY said that the Indian budget revealed a fairly strong financial position.    The provincial contributions were being remitted.The tea trade was no longer to be liable to export duty, tut was to be assessed to income tax; this meant virtually,  the substitution of a tax on profits for a tax on gross turnover,  and the tea industry as a whole would probably benefit by the change.There were signs that Indians export trade was now recovering,  though it was rather later than usual,  and one could tell now how the various crops appeared to be shaping. There had been a diminution of about one million bales in cotton,  and an addition of about two million bales in jute. The prospects of tea exports were probably about the same as last year.    In sugar cane there had been good crops,  and the output was considerably greater than that of last year; on the other hand,  the oil seed crops were probably less, whilst rice was normal.    So far, therefore,  the exportable surplus seemed to be about the same as last year.    The one piece of bad news about the whole crop position related to wheat.    Apparently the exportable wheat orop this year would be short - probably not so much because it was in itself a poor one,  as because the local demand had increased.    Wheat
INDIAN TRADE (Oontd.).was undoubtedly increasing in popularity in India, and consumption was beginning to overtake production.    At any rate reports had been received that cargoes of wheat to the value of  400,000 had been booked for India from Australia during this season, which was an unusual occurrence.    India imported wheat from Australia in 1924, but that was owing to a definitely bad Indian crop.With regard to his observations at the last meeting about the difference betv/een American and Indian cotton prices, Mr. Lindsay put in a statement illustrating what he had said then.    Comparing American middling,  and Indian Uo. 1 fine Oomra,  the prices in Liverpool showed, before the war,  a margin in favour of the former of over by 1917-1918 the marginhad increased to 5g-d; in 1919-1920 it was actually 7-^d., whilst in 1923-1924 it was back again to 5^d. To-day the margin was only about 70 points,  or fd.    That showed an extraordinary change \which had affected the cotton position in India very much.MR.  LINDSAY&apos;S STATEMENT. COTTON.Season.

CONFIDENTIAL. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE wrote:-&quot;The general commercial situation in Chile continues to be influenced, chiefly by the difficulties of re-establishing prosperity in the nitrate industry.   Exports of the fertiliser, however, have been stimulated by the scheuo - to which I referred in my last report to the Council - under which sales were expressly authorised up to a total of 400,000 tons of nitrate, with a guarantee of the Producers&apos; Association for the repurchase of 75 per cent, of the stocks remaining unsold on 30th June next, under certain specified conditions. The full amount provided for has been disposed of, and the announcement is made that no further sales will be contracted under the repurchase scheme.     Sales on ordinary terms are being resumed.&quot;It would appear from recent events that the dissolution of the Nitrate Producers&apos; Association on 30th June next is practically certain, and, under free selling, the chief hope of re-establishing the industry will be the introduction of modernised methods of extracting the fertiliser, which, according to recent reports, have given satisfactory results at certain of the oficinaa..&quot;The Chilean Government resigned on 9th February last, owing, apparently, to the activities of Colonel Carlos Ibanez, the Minister for War, in renewing his protests against alleged activities of Communist organisations. The administra-tion now in power has been formed by Colonel Ibanez himself, and certain politicians suspected of    hostility   to it have been requested to leave the country.&quot;There is no change of importance to report in general business conditions, and, purchases In the import markets are being restricted to those necessary to cover Immediate requirements.    Stocks are generally at a low level, but merchants are naturally Indisposed to enter into extensive commitments for the time being, owing to the unsettled political conditions.&quot;The export movement of the grain crops in Argentina Is exceptionally heavy, and the successful harvest has been reflected in a marked advance in the sterling value of the peso, which, during the past few days, has touched 4&apos;/fu.6d. At this level, the rate is within a small fraction of parity, viz. 47.58d., and is higher than at any time since 1st October, 1921. Moreover, a very good yield of maize is now assured, and should further benefit the general commercial situation. A seasonal dullness has recently characterised the import markets, but, owing to the favourable crop returns, conditions in the approaching buying period   are expected to be good.&quot;In view of the very heavy grain shipments,and the consequent stringency in saoney, the suggestion was made in oertain quarters that emergency legislation should be passed, providing for deposits of gold to be received by the Argentine Legations abroad, against equivalent issues of paper currency in the Republic, a similar measure to that proposed having actually been adopted in 1925.      It is understood that the Minister of Finance has definitely decided to withhold his sanction to the proposed emergency measure, but the circumstance has drawn renewed attention to the desirability
SOUTH AMERICAN TEADE (Oofttd.).of securing greater elasticity in the currency&apos;system to meot seasonal credit demands.&quot;The political situation in Brazil has been tranquil for a considerable time past, and martial law, which had long been enforced in certain parts of the Federal States, on account of sporadic revolts, haB now been terminated throughout the country.&quot;Business conditions remain quiet, but there appears to be in progress a gradual recovery from the severe credit stringency experienced last year.    In Sao Paulo, a marked decline has occurred in recent months in the liabilities Involved in commercial failures,      The outlook is regarded more optimistically, and the tendency in money rates is&apos; easierc&quot;Generally speaking, the coffee crops in the Central American countries have been somewhat smaller than usual, and offerings of Colombian coffees have been comparatively heavy.      In Colombia also, the production of petroleum is increasing.    A number of loans have been placed in New York on behalf of various public bodies, and these flotations have been very favourably received.,      The River Magdalena is again reported at a somewhat low level, but commercial conditions in Bogota are fairly good.    Within the last few months, goods ordered a considerable time ago, and subsequently held up, have been arriving.    Traders are therefore well stocked.      The position of the national finances is satisfactory.&quot;The business revival that was expected in Guatemala at the beginning of 1927 has not yet occurred, owing principally to the quiot conditions in the coffee market. Buyers are reticent, and sellers hope for an advance in prices.    Hardware merchants, however, report increased trade.&quot;The American Minister there is endeavouring to assert his influence towards the recognition of President Diaz in Nicaragua, and it appears that some form of protest is being made in Washington against this procedure,,    Generally speaking, an ant1-American feeling in Central America is now widespread, more especially in view of the Treaty suggested between the United States and Nicaragua on similar lines to that under negotiation with Panama&quot;.TRADE IN CHINA.MR. LANDALE stated that the Peking-Mukden Railway and Tientsin-Pukow Railway were more or less in the hands of Chang Tsolin and Chang Tsung Chung.   No steps had yet been taken to meet the deficit in the case of the latter railway. The Shanghai-Nanking Railway and Shanghai-Ningpo Railway were now being interfered with by troop movements.British shipping on the China Coast had been doing a little better of late, and rates appeared now to be on a paying basis. Business generally, both in exports from China and imports into China, was very spasmodic and the political position was evidently hampering new business. There had, however, been no general cancellation of orders for import cargo, and the volume of business transacted was surprising under the present conditions.

STATEMENT MADE AT THE MEETING OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEETO THE DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADE HELD ON WEDNESDAY, THE 16th FEBRUARY, 1927, REGARDING THE EXPORT TRADE POSITION.Mr. Gray Buchanan (Iron and Steel) thought that the general optimistic tone which was foreshadowed at the last meeting had since &quot;been borne out.    All the pig iron that was being made was going into consumption, though there was but a limited surplus for export.    The steel demand was good so far as the home trade was concerned and more business was being received from Australia and India.As regards Shanghai it was reported that stocks were low, and that local importers were Insisting on replacement orders. He stated that the position in America with regard to the threatened coal strike was an interesting one.    The strike if it came off, as seemed possible, would only affect bituminous coal.    The effect of it would be not a complete cessation as in this country, as only about 22 per cent.    of the men were affected as Union members but, nevertheless, he thought that the result would be that the neutral markets would be left open for this country to satisfy.Mr. Bnsley (Bradford Dress Goods)  stated that as regards the Bradford trade, prospects were exceedingly gloomy.    Ko orders were being received from China.    If, however, a settle-ment was reached in Hankow, it was probable that good business in the wool trade would result.Mr. Vyle (Hardware and Metals)  stated that in the trades with which he was concerned the general position since December   j had shown a steady improvement.    The heavy trades were, however, not moving much.    Certain trades were experiencing considerable   \ difficulty in getting steel and in the shipbuilding industry a number of orders were in hand and awaiting supplies of steel which were expected about the end of February.There was one point to which he wished to draw special attention.    This was the Spanish treaty.    He understood that negotiations were to be revived in. the near future and he was of opinion that the Board of Trade ought to call together the expert committee which was appointed to advise them on this matter go that they would be available when required.    In response to theChairman/
Chairman, he said that he would be glad to send in a memorandum on the subject.The Chairman asked whether he would, as President of the Association of Chambers of Commerce, take opportunities of stating publicly that it was essential for British firms to overhaul their agency arrangements since it was essential to follow up quality and advertising by the ability to sell.Mr. Vyle agreed that the question of selling organisation needed constant attention, and he further stated that he would suggest that local representatives should in all cases get in touch with and work with the local British trade representative, the Consul or Trade Commissioner.Mr. Emsley stated that the Bradford trade was fully alive to the necessity of properly qualified representatives abroad, and, in fact, they were sending annually 20 young men abroad to learn the language of the country in which they were to reside.    On this question Mr. Hichens stated that the difficulty was they were finding it hard to pay proper remuneration for really first class men.    They were actually employing one man where they ought to have two .Mr. Vyle continuing stated that as regards business in Brazil, there were difficulties due to the high tariff, and to the currency question.    It was understood that the Govern-ment were aiming at standardisation of the milreis at about 10d.    This seemed rather a high figure.    The present rate was 5-g-, but the main thing was to have stabilisation.Mr. Rowland (Agricultural and General Engineering) agreed with Mr.  Samuel1s remarks as to the necessity for an efficient selling organisation.    In his opinion it was important that firms, or groups of firms, should have representatives to Investigate their agency arrangements.    These representatives would not take the place of agents, but would keep an eye on them and at times act as feeders for them.    On the whole trade was showing an improvement.    Enquiries were good.Mr.  Jones  (Banking)  stated that as regards Hankow, the tendency was for trade to be diverted to foreign banks, Italian, Belgian and French, under the boycott against British institutions.    He understood that there was a large business in arms going on from Germany, but this ?/e were precluded from financing from this country.    As regards Shanghai, trade had been badly held up, but the landing of the troops had undoubtedly given confidence.Mr. Ilargreaves  (Coal)  said that in the coal trade everybody was now at work.    The demand was smaller than had been expected, being slight from the iron and steel and the textile trades.    One factor which was militating against resumption of normal business was the bad service of the railways, the congestion being so great that wagons frequently did only two journeys a month.    He understood that this was clue in part at any rate to the import of foreign coal but that this would work Itself out in time.Mr./
1 1c) i 00Mr. Wilson,  (&quot;Labour&quot;) with regard to the cutlery and plate trade, stated that prospects were gloomy, though there had been a better demand from the Dominions.  . In the tool trade the total exports had declined by about 10 f but there were signs of a revival and fairly substantial orders had been received from Russia.    In the stainless cutlery trade p-ros-pects were good.    Scandinavia was, he thought, turning to Sheffield from Germany.    On the whole, prospects were better than twelve months ago.Mr. Hichens  (Shipbuilding) thought it was unwise to talk too optimistically as to trade prospects unless it was abundantly clear that there was good reason for so doing.As regards shipbuilding,  it was true that orders for tankers had been taken recently, but they were at low prices, and he was convinced that there were not enough orders in sight to fill the yards.    As regards the steel industry, they were naturally busy overtaking arrears, and now had about four months&apos; work&apos;in hand, but there was not enough business visible to guarantee continuous employment.    The fact of the matter was that foreign prices were still a long way below ours, since their wages and coal were lower.    He thought that there was a reasonable prospect of a slight improvement, provided it was recognised on all sides that the position was not a good one, that everybody was determined on efficiency and economy and that the Government must help.He added that the report of the Imperial Conference had created a very good impression in South Africa.    While he thought that the prospects there were likely to improve, he considered that we must be in a position to quote on equal terms with our competitors.Colonel Peel (Banking and Export Credits)  stated that as regards the Export Credits scheme though much spade work had been, done the harvest was not yet.Mr. Johnston (Pottery)  stated that things were a little better in the pottery trade.    As regards sanitary pottery,orders were not satisfactory, competition being acute from Czecho-Slovakia and Germany.    As regards china as the Committee were aware, an application for safeguarding had recently been made and this had shown that wages in Czecho-Slovakia were half what they were in this country.    The only satisfactory section was the fine china trade, which was doing well in the United States.Mr. Parker (Boots and Shoes)  stated that the situation in the boot and shoe trade was better than it was two months ago. Orders from overseas were increasing.    The situation in Australia was hopeless, owing to the tariff, but there was more business being done with America than before.    As regards Canada he wished to ask the Department to keep a watch on the activities of the boot and shoe producers who were seeking to reduce the preference given to British goods.Mr. Lindsay/
Mr. Lindsay (Indian trade) referred to  the question of agencies and stated that it might be of interest, to remind the Committee that the Indian Stores Department had recently revised their rules.    Under the old rules the practice was to buy foreign goods in the country of origin, but the new rules encouraged local purchases of foreign goods and thus gave distinct advantage to firms with local branches.    On the question of the Tariff Board&apos;s report on iron and steel which had just been published, he stated that he was hopeful that the recommendations would be accepted.    He thought that this was a sincere and fair attempt to equalise competition between Indian and British, and non-British steel.    If accepted, it might have the effect of putting Tata&apos;s into an even stronger position than they occupied to-day, in that by a reduction in the amount of the tariff fresh firms might be discouraged from opening up.Mr. Lindsay pointed out that the reduction In the price of American cotton had brought the prices of American and Indian cotton very near together, nearer, in fact, than they had been for many years.The decline in prices had very much affected Indian exports which in 1926 showed a decline of  70,000,000 from the figures of 1925.    Of this, cotton accounted for  25,000,000, grain and seeds  18,000,000, and jute  7,000,000.    The value of imports on the other hand had been unaffected.Mr. Lee (Cotton Spinning)  stated that on the whole the cotton trade was improving.    The demand was better and there was more machinery going.    He did not think the price of American cotton could fall much lower, since it was already below the cost of production.    Cheap cotton,of course, did not affect them in competition with other producers, though it naturally did encourage buying.Mr, Thompson (Manchester goods) agreed generally with Mr. Lee&apos;s statement of the position, but he pointed out that the improvement was of short duration and spasmodic.    He stated we had lost a considerable amount of trade in the coarser kind of goods made by Japan from Indian cotton, but the low price of American cotton had now enabled us to compete. On the whole he thought there was just a chance that better times were coming.
