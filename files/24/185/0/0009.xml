[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted /or the Cabinet.   February 1927SECRET.- CABINET.CP. 60 (27)Indian Navy Bill.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I circulate the draft of a Bill to provide for the creation of an Indian Navy as a combatant force to replace the existing Royal Indian Marine Service.The history which lies behind this policy is as follows. The East India Company was authorised to maintain for the defence of its possessions an armed naval force, which was known as the Indian Navy and continued to exist till 1863. Its chief duties were the maintenance of engagements with neighbouring States, the policing of the Indian Seas, the transport service of troops, and survey work in Indian waters. After the Mutiny it was decided to abolish the Indian Navy and to transfer its combatant duties to the Royal Navy. An Indian Marine was, however, established, which was developed later into the existing Royal Indian Marine. Its functions are, in effect, confined to the conveyance of troops and stores, the provision of station ships for Aden, the Andamans and Rangoon, Marine Survey, and the service of lights and lighthouses in Indian waters.The Royal Indian Marine was in main taken over by the Admiralty during the war and employed on regular naval duties. After the war the question of reorganising&quot; it as a combatant naval force, able to take its place among the navies of the Empire, was taken in hand and examined in turn by Lord Jellicoe in 1919 and by two successive Naval Commanders-in-Chief, East Indies, in 1922 and 1924. A scheme outlined by the latter of these two was accepted as a basis for discussion between the India Office and the Admiralty, and as a result of a Conierence, in which Lord Rawlinson (then Commander-in-Chief in India) and Sir Roger Keyes took part, it was decided, in 1924 to set up a Departmental Committee in India, under the presidency of Lord Rawlinson and with an Admiralty representative in the person of the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, to work out detailed proposals. The Committee^ report, which was submitted in 1925, was finally accepted on behalf of the Government of India, the India Office, and the Admiralty, later in the year, and the Viceroy was authorised, with the approval of the King, to announce in February 1926 the intention to create a Royal Indian Navy. The policy thus declared is in accordance with the recommendation of the Imperial Conference of 1923 emphasising the primary responsibility of each portion of the Empire represented at the Conference for its own local defence, and has since been endorsed by the Imperial Conference of 1926.The terms of reference to the Departmental Committee were as follows :  To prepare a scheme for the reorganisation of the Royal Indian Marine so as to form the nucleus of an Indian Navy, with special reference to -(1) The functions to be ultimately i^erformed by the Indian Navy, and methods of employment with a view to its undertaking those functions.(2) The number and class of. vessels that can be maintained with available budget allotment.(3) Recruitment, strength, training and conditions of service of personnel.(4) Relations between the higher command of the Indian Navy, Govern-ment of India and Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, including&apos; the proposed appointment of Chief of the Naval Staff, India.(5) Provision for and maintenance of vessels, including the continuance, or abolition, of the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard. :The Committee recommended that the new service should be known as the &quot; Royal Indian Navy,&quot; and should fly the White Ensign. Its peace-time functions should be the training of personnel for war, maintenance of services required by the Government of India in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, the organisation of the naval defences of Indian ports, survej&apos; work in the Indian Ocean, and marine transport work for the1803      100   2.27J 0
Government of India. The original squadron should consist&quot;, of four sloops two patrol craft vessels, four trawlers, two survey ships, and one depot ship. The Committee contemplated that in the course of its development the Indian Navy should eventually undertake the policing of the Persian Gulf now carried out by the Royal Navy, and that two sloops should be added hereafter to the Indian Navy for the purpose. They recommended that the executive officers should be recruited at an average rate of three a year, of whom one should be an Indian. The commissioned officers should, like those of the present Royal Indian Marine, hold King&apos;s commissions, which should confer authority limited to the Indian Navy.Legislation in both the Imperial and the Indian Legislature is necessary to effect the change, since the Government of India Act contains sections relating to the Royal Indian Marine which will have to be adapted to the maintenance of an Indian Navy. The Bill has been prepared jointly by the Admiralty, the Dominions OiTice and the India Office. Its scope is described in the explanatory memorandum. It may be added that the effect of the Bill, in prescribing the conditions of employment of the Indian Navy, will be to place the Navy in a position similar to that of the Army in India. The use of the Army for non-Indian purposes, though not governed by Statute except as regards expenditure from Indian revenues, is regulated by two main principles which have been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government : (1) &quot;That the purposes for whicli the Army is maintained in India are the defence of India against external aggression and the maintenance of internal order;&quot; and (2) &quot; that, except in the gravest emergency, the Indian Army should be employed outside the Indian Empire only after consultation with the Governor-General in Council &quot; (OLD. paper No. .130 D dated the 2Gth January 1923, paras. 10 and 44).1 hope it will be found possible to introduce the Bill at an earty date. The policy which it embodies was formally announced 12 months ago, and it is important that the Indian Legislature should be placed in a position to deal with the consequential legislation in India before the autumn.BIRKENBEAD.India Office, 17th February UJ27.
