[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1927.147SECRET. Copy No.   30CP. 80 (27.)CABINET.THE FRANCHISE QUESTION.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. IT has been said that every extension of the franchise has benefited the Conservative Party, and it is certainly true that the latest election on the widest franchise has produced the largest homogeneous Conservative majority. There is, however, a danger that such generalisations do not take sufficient account of times and circum-stances. The gradual extension of the franchise over a century has been steadily accompanied by a general improvement in prosperity and by the rallying of new classes to Constitutional government, to the defence of property and to the maintenance of the Empire. The consequences of the gigantic extension of the franchise in 1918 have been masked by two very important facts; first of all the withdrawal of 80 adverse Irish votes, and secondly, the splitting for the time being into two unequal but substantial parts of the pre-war anti-Conservative British vote. But for these two facts, i.e., if parties had continued on pre-war lines, Conservatism would probably be still in a minority. Even under the super-favourable circumstances of the last election, a majority of 000,000 votes was cast against us. If the adverse vote had its proper numerical representation, we should even now be in a minority in the House of Commons of about 20; and if to this had been added the 80 adverse Irish, of 100. It would therefore seem that the 1918 extension would not necessarily in itself have been favourable to Conservatism.2. The Irish exclusion is no doubt permanent; but it would be very rash to assume that the adverse vote against us in 1924 will indefinitely fail to secure adequate representation in Parliament. Even on the existing basis any mistake on our part which created a &quot; Bloc des Gaudies &quot;. would by that very fact alone place us in a minority. In any case we must expect a continuous approximation of the adverse voting strength towards its arithmetical representation in Parliament.   Some sort ofI5S22 B
arrangement between Liberals and Labour against.vote splitting will almost certainly play a part in the next election. Is this the moment for us to increase the electorate by approximately 25 per ceut. ? A mathe-matical survey is hardly encouraging ! If in an electorate of 21 millions we are in a minority of 600,000, we should in an electorate of 26 millions be in a minority over 750,000 votes. Elections are decided by the margins and a 25 per cent, larger adverse margin would be thrown against us even if the new electorate toas no less favourable to us than, the old.3. The quite decided reports received from the Chairman of the Party as to the complexion of the extended electorate will no doubt have been read by the Cabinet. They seem to have taken a good many members of the Cabinet Committee by surprise. In so far as they are well-founded they reinforce the purely mathematical tendencies mentioned above. It was moreover pointed out to us that any extension of the franchise on a large scale would create such extraordinary discrepancies between the size of constituencies ranging perhaps from 100,000 to 35,000-that a Redistribution Bill, with all its disturbance and unpopularity and with all its undermining effects upon the personal relation of individual Members to their constituencies, would be inevitable in the present Parliament. Since the greatest numbers of the new voters would be found in the industrial areas, such a measure must undoubtedly give a large number of additional safe seats to the Socialists at the expense of existing country constituencies. Along this path we may easily march to a decisive and long-lasting defeat.4. Such considerations cannot be brushed aside as immaterial or unworthy by those who are responsible for the guidance of the one great organised Party capable at the present time of affording a solid and integral basis for British Government. There is no country so devoid of any form of constitutional safeguards as ours, nor is there any in which the influence of a passing mood upon the electorate is so direct and decisive. Neither is there any community of equal magnitude whose economic life is so artificial and complex or whose affairs are so vast, delicate and varied. Moreover, the facts of the particular period through which we are passing the aftermath of the war, the general strike aud the subversive movement in the industrial popula-tion, the enthronement of a revolutionary faction in Moscow devoted to the cause of world revolution, the disorganised condition and flimsy structure of the ever-growing Labour Party at home  all enjoin prudence and impose responsibility upon us in an unusual degree. In a few years the assimilative power of British institutions, the healing processes of peace, the revival of world prosperity, may ease the whole position. Above all, the Labour party, amalgamating with Liberal elements, may well be steadily developing into a trustworthy though unpalatable alternative administrative instrument. Its programme will become more solidly defined.   A Socialist majority at the next election
314might claim a mandate for anything between a sort of milk-and-water sentimentalism and a general overturn. As time passes the extreme elements will be driven out of the Labour party and a &quot; Bloc des Gauches &quot; formed which will not be very different in character and intention from the Radical majority of 190(5. But that position will not be reached by the next election. The good of the nation as a whole requires a step by step advance and forbids a violent alteration in the existing wide political basis. Certainly before any such plunge is taken there ought to be a reasonable certainty that the vast new electorate of 1918 has been digested and properly incorporated in the various Party organisations. Above all, no such adventure should be decided upon without long, earnest study and discussion by the responsible Government.5. 1 cannot feel that there is any deep or forceful popular move-men t in favour of a further immediate extension of the franchise. Nearly a quarter of the present electorate do not even trouble to use their votes. The decision to enfranchise 5 or 6 million additional electors, and finally to transfer the control of our affairs to a majority of women, is surely one of the greatest events of our history. I have never heard it discussed except casually in any council of which I have been a member. The House of Commons has only chattered about it in the irresponsible atmosphere of a private Member&apos;s Friday. It was in no sense an issue at the last election. I do not believe it counted in the slightest degree in the decision which men and women all over the country then took. When I fought the Westminster election in the spring of 1924, I declared flatly against any further extension for at least ten years without being conscious of any appreciable loss of support. In the General Election so little was the matter in the public mind that I do not remember having&quot; referred to the declaration of&apos; the Leader of the Conservative Party and 1 certainly continued to answer the routine questions of the women&apos;s societies by general statements to the effect that &quot;while the principle of an equal franchise for both sexes was indisputable it was too soon to make a new large expansion of the electorate.&quot; No one seemed the least upset at this.(5.   The Prime Ministers declaration was as follows: &quot; The Unionist Partjr are in favour of equal political rights, for men and women, and desire that the question of the extension of the franchise should, if possible, be settled by agreement. With this in view they would, if returned to power, propose that the matter be referred to a conference of all political parties on the lines of the Ullswater Committee.&quot;Here we have a statement of the general intentions and outlook of the Conservative Party the essential point of which is not disputed to-day by any important section of public opinion, namely, the principle of equal rights for men and women.   No one disputes that this is bound15822 B 2
to come, but as to when the goal is to be reached we are, according to the Prime Ministers statement, entirely free. There are many planks in Party platforms which, owing to changing circumstances, very often and very happily are rendered entirely obsolete. The greatest and most vital of our pledges at the last Election was to give steady and stable Government and to combat the Socialist movement. Although, therefore, we were bound in principle, we were perfectly free so far as Election pledges are concerned as to time, degree and method.7. On the 18th February, 1925, the Cabinet Minutes record that we considered the Prime Ministers pledge in relation to a Private Member&apos;s Bill to be introduced on Friday, the 20th February. The Minute concludes as follows : &quot;Summarising the discussion, the Home Secretary proposed, in opposing the Second Reading, to refer to uhe Prime Ministers pledge as quoted above, and to state that the Government intended to give effect to it later in the life of the present Parliament by proposing a Conference of all political parties.&quot;Such were the views and intentions of the Cabinet. But, speaking in the House, the Home Secretary used the following language: &quot; We do mean to carry out that pledge. We do mean to give equal political rights to men and women, but we desire to do it byagreement.....The Prime Minister adheres to his statement.   Itwill be carried out. (Hon. Members: &apos;When&apos;?&apos;) It will be carried out by this Parliament.Viscountess Astor: . . . . does the Right Hon. Gentleman mean equal votes at 21 ?Sir W. Joynson-Hicks : It means exactly what it says. (Hon. Members: &apos; Answer!&apos;) No, it would be wrong of me to pre-judge the views which hon. Members opposite might put before the con-ference. It means that a conference will be held that is my proposal at which all parties will be asked to be present, and they will then be asked to consider how the Prime Minister&apos;s pledge can best be carried out.&quot;So far so good ; but observe what followed: &quot; The Prime Minister&apos;s pledge is for eqtial rights and at the next election. I -will say quite definitely that means that no difference will take place in the ages at ivhicli men and women trill go to the poll at the next election.&quot;The italics are mine.
The House thereafter on a Government amendment resolved as follows: &quot; That this House declines in the early stages of a new Paiiia-ment to accord a Second Reading to a Franchise Bill, involving as it would a, General Election with the consequent interruption of important legislative and administrative work, and records its opinion that a considered scheme of franchise reform should be brought before this House at a suitable opportunity within the lifetime of the present Parliament.&quot;S. It is clear from the Home Secretary&apos;s speech that the &quot; considered scheme of franchise reform &quot; was not to be brought before the House except as the result of a Speakers Conference, and there is a strong implication in the words &quot;we desire to do it by agreement&quot; that a general agreement between parties was a condition. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, speaking after the Home Secretary, showed how he inter-preted the position &quot; Next year we ai*e promised not a bill, not a principle, not a declaration of policy, but simply an enquiry, upon what we do not know . . . .&quot; And further on &quot; It would be a waste of time and a farce for two or three people to go into consultation with a principle like this left open in this way.&quot; It would therefore seem that the Leader of the Opposition did not take a serious view of the language used by the Home Secretary. Captain AVedgwood Benn spoke for the Liberal party on this point in the same sense. There was evidently a good deal of confusion as between the pledge of the Prime Minister for a conference or enquiry, the language of the Home Secretary and the Government amendment about legislation in the present Parliament, and also about the ages of 21 and 25. In the upshot the Leader of the Opposition rejected the Government declaration.9. However, the conclusion which emerges from reading the whole Debate is undoubtedly First, that the Home Secretary, in the passage underlined, put an interpretation on the Prime Ministers pre-election declaration which went far beyond what the party was committed to or the Cabinet had sanctioned, and also beyond anything which had ever been discussed in a grave or practical manner by any body of responsible Ministers. Secondly, that this declaration was over-laid by and mixed up with a number of emphatic but vague statements about a Speaker&apos;s Conference and the need of a &quot;general agreement&quot; and &quot;a considered bill .... carried unanimously.&quot; Thirdly, that none of these declarations, authorised or unauthorised, considered or impromptu, was accepted by the spokesmen of either the Labour or Liberal parties. They remain on record to be judged on their merits as party and Government commitments : but they
were no part of a &quot; Parliamentary bargain &quot; or of any compact entered into with any section of the Opposition. Nevertheless one cannot doubt that the position lias been greatly changed by the Home Secretary&apos;s words, and it may well happen that the whole course of history will have been deflected by the chance utterances in the pressure of debate of a single Minister speaking beyond Cabinet authority during a Friday afternoon on a Private Member&apos;s Bill.10. Let me say that by acquiescing in tho Home Secretary&apos;s statement we have clearly made our moral position towards the House of Commons the same as his, and that he is in no way isolated in responsibility. Moreover, the Prime Minister himself, speaking at the end of the Debate, while avoiding the precise and peccant statement of our colleague, did not restrict or modify it in any way.11. What then are the courses open to us&apos;? I feel that while the Prime Ministers declaration must and can be made good, we must hold ourselves free at this moment to take an independent decision upon the expansions given to it. The Home Secretary&apos;s statements were made to the House of Commons and the same House of Commons can, if it pleases, relieve us from them. The Parliament has still nearly three years to run, and in consequence it cannot be said that it is too late for us to seek any relief we may require. I hold therefore that unless we are convinced on the merits that absolutely7 equal rights for both sexes at the next election would be in the main interest of the British nation and Empire we ought, without losing time, to restate our position to Parliament. Such a course, though fraught with some unpleasantness, is far less questionable than to drive the country against our convictions into a decision which may not be for its good and may even prove disastrous to its peace and power. Once we have decided where our duty lies we ought not to be turned from it by the derision and reproaches in which it is the natural function of our opponents to indulge.9. The Prime Ministers promise was to set up a conference of all Parties on the Ullswater model.Lord Ullswater gave the following account of his conference in 1917 :-&quot; I accepted an invitation from the Prime Minister to convene a conference of Members of both Houses of Parliament and to preside over it. The Members of Parliament and Peers whom I selected appeared to me to be eminently representative of the various shades of political opinion in Parliament and in the country upon the special topics connected with electoral reform. Their numbers were as nearly as possible proportionate to the strength of pre-war Parties in the House of Commons.The Conference, by its terms of reference, was asked to examine &quot; and if i^ossiMe submit agreed resolutions on &quot; the various questions
submitted to it. Most of its resolutions appear as unanimous but in some cases, e.g., Woraeifs Suffrage, the resolutions are stated to be the decision of the majority only.12. The Prime Minister&apos;s promise to set up such a conference did not commit us in any way to accept its conclusions nor to accept them at any particular time, certainly not in the lifetime of the present Parliament. Nor did it commit us to any particular method nor to action of any kind in the event of disagreement. We could therefore set up such a conference without in any way prejudging our action, if we thought its advice was bad for the country. There are serious dangers in this conference: it will change the question for the first time from an academic to a practical issue and greatly increase such agitation as exists in favour of a wide departure. If it is to be set up it would be imperative that we should first of all (a) restate our position to the House of Commons so far as may benecessary in respect of the Home Secretary&apos;s obiter dicta; (/;) make it perfectly clear that we shall be bound by no decisions ofthe conference which are not decisions agreed upon between all three Parties ; and (c) that failing such agreement we hold ourselves free to take no action in the present Parliament.13. I am sure that the Cabinet Committee will not be able to make any further progress on this question. It would seem that the Cabinet ought in the near future to come to a very difficult and grave decision. Much as I apprehend the clangers of this conference I think on the whole, after much hesitation, it may prove to be the inevitable step. The promise of a conference was precise and practical, and the mere disinclination of any particular Speaker to undertake to preside over it would not be held a sufficient bar.14. I summarise the alternatives which, in my opinion, are still open to us : (A.) To set up a Conference like the Ullswater Conference, as promised by the Prime Minister, and as promised by the Home Secretary in the session of 1926, after having regained the necessary liberty of action by a Resolution in the House of Commons ; and thereafter upon this Conference, so far as it is open to us through representatives of our views, to refuse to agree (a) to   anything  beyond   the   sex   equalisation   of   the franchise of persons over 30; or (b) to anything beyond 25 for both sexes ;
or(c) to anything beyond the compromise proposal of an equal residential qualification at 25 and an equal occupational qualification at 21 for both sexes.(Of these subsidiary alternatives I prefer the last. I beg that it may be most earnestly examined, and that the objections to it may be weighed against the objections to other coui*ses and not taken as decisive in themselves.)Failing agreement to hold ourselves free to refuse to legislate in the present Parliament, or alternatively to legislate on our own solution, either (a), (b) or (c),or (B.) To throw ourselves boldly and with as much con-fidence as we can muster, into universal suffrage with the consequent inseparable Redistribution Bill, both to be made effective before the General Election.In this case a Conference would be unnecessary. All would have been conceded, and the greater includes the less.W. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1 March 8, 1927.
