THIS DOGUMBUT 15 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITiUCTIO MAJESTY&apos;S OOVgRMBNIE.Copy lo.CAB HISTMB QUOD OF DEALING WITH AUDIT 3U3CHA5GE3.MaMOKAflDIM BY THE&apos; MI MS TEH OF HEALTH.I desir8 to bring to the notice of my colleagues an urgent matter arising out of a decision in the Courts this week which will, I fear, necessitate legislation during the present Session.It has been the practice &quot;erf Poplar and some other Metropolitan Borough Councils in fixing the wages of their employees to disregard standards fixod by such bodies as Joint Industrial Councils and to adopt rates very materially in excess.     For example, Poplar adopted a  4 a week minimum. These Councils are In fact concerned to fix wages by reference to political theories rather than to ordinary standards.    In the accounts of the Poplar Borough Council for the year 1921-22 the District Auditor disallowed charges to the extent of  5,000 in respect of wage payments made by the Counoil and surcharged this sum on certain Councillors named in his certificate.The question was brought before the Courts by the Borough Council with a view to the District Auditor&apos;s certificate being quashed.     The case was carried to the House of Lords and the decision of the District Auditor was there finally affirmed.Subsequently, the Borough Council appealed to. me to remit the surcharge.     After some negotiation with representatives of the Council, in view primarily of the fact that the point taken before the Courts as to the limits of the discretion of the Borough Council in the matter ofSC3ST P.65(27).
wages was a new one and that the Council had subsequently taken some action to&quot;bring their procedure within the decision arrived at by the House of Lords, I made an Order remitting this suroharge,  together with the other later surcharges of a similar character in the period up to the House of lords decision.-My Order remitting the surcharge has now been quashed in the High Court on the motion of ratepayers of Poplar on the ground that where a surcharge has been confirmed on appeal to the Courts I have no jurisdiction to make an Order of remission.The result in the Poplar case is that it becomes the Auditor*s duty to enforce the surcharge and this he can be compelled to do by mandamus on the part of ratepayers.     If the sums oertified as due by the Auditor are not paid, the amounts due may be levied by distress and sale of the goods of the persons surcharged, who are jointly and severally liable, and if no sufficient distress can be had, a Court of summary jurisdiction may cause the persons surcharged to be committed to prison for a term not exceeding three months.It is clear that it is useless to expect repayment of sums of the magnitude of  5,000 from persons such as those who are responsible for Poplar policy.      Che same is true of the similar cases of Bethnal Green and Woolwich which have also been before the Court and where surcharges of  2,000 and  29,500 are in question.     The oa3e of Bethnal Green is complicated by the fact that the surcharges would fall upon some persons who were not in favour of the extravagances, but who, being in a small and ineffective minority, had not been able to challenge a vote and had failed to place their opposition on record.In existing circumstances the District Auditor will cause a distress to be levied and if, after the Councillors&apos;
goods have been sold up, the proceeds are insufficient to meet the distress, which will most probably be the case, there appears to be nothing to prevent the Councillors then being in due course committed to prison.It will be remembered that in 1921 the Poplar Borough Council refused to meet precepts made upon them by the L.C.C. and the M.A.B. and they wore committed to prison because they refused to comply with writs of mandamus directing them to pay. They remained in prison for some two months.     There was muoh agitation, threats of similar action by other metropolitan boroughs, a deputation of metropolitan mayors to the Prime Minister at Gairloch pleading the cause of Poplar, and ultimately the Councillors made an affidavit to the Court disavowing any contumacy and praying that they might be released to take part in a conference called by the Minister of Health which it was hoped would provide a way out of the financial difficulties in which the Borough was placed.We do not want to repeat this undignified and futile farce.     Moreover by agreeing to remission I have indicated that in my view there is reasonable ground for not enforcing the surcharge in the Poplar case.The only alternative is that the matter should be dealt with by legislation.       The suggestion already made by a number of authorities -that they should be assured of an absolute discretion in regard to wages, or that wages should be removed from the jurisdiction of the District Auditor cannot, of course, be accepted:    neither do I think it desirable to legislate for power of remission to be granted to the Minister in cases where appeal against a surcharge has been made to the Courts.     It is clear, however, that the existing method of surcharge and recovery is entirely ineffective to control action by local authorities which is dictated by political motives and it seems
to me also to be undesirable that questions of remission in these political cases should be in the hands of a Minister.The most effective way of dealing with the matter appears to be to give the Courts power to remit surcharges on appeal, but with a requirement that the Court shall disqualify the persons surcharged from being members of a local authority for a period of 5 years, unless the Court is satisfied that the surcharged expenditure was incurred In good faith and in the belief that it was authorised by law. The Minister should at the same time be empowered   to refuse to entertain applications for remission of surcharges In certain cases and to refer applicants to their power of appealing to the Courts.I should therefore be glad to have authority to introduce a short Bill, which I anticipate would run to two clauses, providing for procedure on these lines:    it would be necessary, of course, in consideration of the new arrangements for the future to provide for wiping out the surcharge in the old cases such as Poplar.H.C. 1st February, 1927.
