[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1927.SECRET.(Ministry of Labour Industrial Memoranda, Serial No. 6.)CP. 67 (27).CABINET.Copy No.    30NOTE ON THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL COUNCIL, 1911, AND THE INDUSTRIAL CONFERENCES, 1918 AND 1919.THE first experiment in the creation of, a standing body representative of employers and employed to assist the Government in dealing with industrial affairs was made in 1911, when, with a view to strengthening the existing official machinery for the settlement of disputes, an Industrial Council was established for the purpose of considering and enquiring into matters referred to them affecting trade disputes, and especially of taking suitable action in regard to any dispute referred to them affecting the principal trades of the country or likely to cause disagreement involving ancillary trades, if the parties before or after the breaking out of a dispute are themselves unable to settle.&quot; The Council consisted of thirteen representatives of employers and an equal number of workpeople, presided over by Sir George, now Lord, Ask with. The memorandum issued by the Board of Trade with respect to the Council stated that the Government did not desire to interfere, but rather to encourage and foster such voluntary methods or agreements as were then in force or were likely to be adopted for the prevention of stoppage of work, or for the settlement of disputes, but it was thought desirable that the operations of the Board of Trade in the discharge of their duties under the Conciliation Act should be supplemented and strengthened and that effective means should be available for referring such difficulties as might arise in a trade to investigation, conciliation or arbitration, as the case might be.2. The Council examined and reported upon the question of securing due fulfilment of industrial agreements. It intervened in industrial disputes on two occasions only, in a dispute affecting dock labourers at Newport (Mon.), and in the coal mining dispute in 1912. In neither case were the Councils efforts successful in terminating the dispute. On the first occasion it was asked to intervene (by the Newport Borough Council); on the second occasion it intervened on its own initiative, but it received no encouragement from either the Coalowners&apos; Association or the Miners&apos; Federation.In the special conditions created by the War the Industrial Council fell into abeyance.3. Immediately upon the conclusion of the War, the Minister of Labour summoned a National Conference of Employers&apos; Associations and Trade Unions. The conference was attended by the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet. The two most important matters before the conference were the position of the war wage advances and the question of the restoration of the pre-war practices which had been modified by the unions for the purpose of increasing output. Legislation was subsequently carried to deal with these two matters, viz., the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918, and the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act, 1919.4. In February 1919, the Minister of Labour summoned a further National Conference of Employers&apos; Associations, Trade. Unions, Joint Industrial Councils and Trade Boards to consider the causes of unrest and to suggest methods of removing them. The Conference appointed a Provisional Joint Committee to report on the causes of unrest and the steps necessary to safeguard and promote the best interests of employers, workpeople and the State, and especially to consider (1) questions relating to hours, wages and general conditions of employment, (2) unemployment and its prevention, and (3) the best methods of promoting co-operation between capital and labour.  The Provisional Joint Committee issued a Report embodying a[15812]&apos;b
number of conclusions, a summary of which is set out in an Appendix to this memorandum (Appendix I). The Report was submitted to and approved by the National Conference.5. At a meeting of the Joint Provisional Committee, held on the 1st May, 1919, the following communication from the Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George, signifying the general acceptance by the Government of the Committee&apos;s proposals was read :  &quot; Gentlemen, I have read your report very carefully, and deeply regret that I am unable to meet you in person in order to thank you for the very valuable piece of work which you nave done.On the Continent, as I have good reason to know, your work is being closely watched. Foreign countries are looking to Great Britain to give them a lead in the foundation of a new and better industrial order, and this report marks the beginning of such a foundation.Though I cannot commit myself to every detail, as many of them are complex and technical, I may say at once that I fully accept in principle your recommendations as to the fixing of maximum hours and minimum rates of wages. As regards hours, a Bill is now being drafted to give effect to your recommendations, and will, I hope, be introduced at a very early date. I think you will find that it fully carries out the principles set forth in your Report, though, as you have recognised, elasticity must be provided in order to meet the special circumstances of particular industries.There are certain industries, such as agriculture, in which seasonal and other conditions necessitate special consideration; and in some cases, such as seamen and domestic servants, in which it would be impossible to enforce a week of 48 hours; but I agree that the Act should otherwise apply to all industries in which a legal limitation of hours is practicable, and that, where exceptions are necessary, they should be applied for by those concerned through the machinery which you have suggested in your report.As regards wages, I accept the principle that minimum rates of wages should in all industries be made applicable by law. The question of the best method of doing this, however, is complex and full of difficulties, and I do not think it would be possible to frame legislation until a scheme for carrying out the principle of minimum rates has been fully worked out. I, therefore, gladly accept your suggestion that the Government should, in the first place, set up a Commission with wide terms of reference to report on the whole matter. As regards the extension of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, a Bill has been prepared for this purpose and has been introduced.In regard to unemployment, I understand that your Committee was unable to make any definite recommendation as to how the present provision against unemployment should be extended. In view of the short time at your disposal, I do not think that the Committee could be blamed for this, but the question of unemployment is one of the most urgent and important of the problems confronting us, and until it is satisfactorily solved I do not feel that we shall have really effected one of the most vital improvements in our social conditions. I, therefore, hope that this is the first question to which the National Industrial Council will&apos;address itself.I cordially welcome your proposal to set up a National Council, and hope that you will take steps to bring it into being as quickly as possible, as I am sure that it will be of great value in assisting the Government to improve industrial conditions.&quot;6. In accordance with the recommendation of the Provisional Joint Committee, the Government proceeded at once to take the necessary steps to continue, the opera-tion of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, and on the 29th May the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Extension Act, 1919, was passed, extending the Act of 1918 until the 21st November, 1919 ; it was subsequently extended by the Industrial Courts Act for a further period of twelve months expiring in September 1920.7. Preliminary steps were also taken to give effect to the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations upon hours of work. The Ministry of Labour, in collaboration with the Home Office, prepared a draft Bill to regulate hours of employment, and, after con-sultation with the Joint Committee, the Hours of Employment (No. 2) Bill was introduced into Parliament in October 1.919. It was impossible, however, to carry the Bill through its various stages during that Session; and, in view of the anticipated
publication of the recommendations of the International Labour Conference which sat at Washington from the 29th October to the 29th November, 1919, and of the multiplicity of enquiries and suggestions to which the publication of the Bill naturally gave rise, it was decided to defer its reintroduction until a more suitable opportunity. Difficulties arose as a result of the demand that the 48-hour week should be applied also to agriculture and seamen, and with regard to amendments to bring the Bill into line with the Washington Convention. Later negotiations failed to produce agreement.8. Unemployment insurance was widely extended by the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920. (In this connection it should be noted that the Provisional Joint Committee were unable to secure agreement on the subject of extending unemployment insurance. The Labour side of the Committee urged that a complete and comprehensive scheme of unemployment provision extending to all workers on a non-contributory basis should be instituted at the earliest possible moment and that the scheme should provide, for adequate maintenance of unemployed workers and for the making up of maintenance pay to under-employed workers.)9. With regard to the suggested establishment of a National Industrial Council, it should be borne in mind that the Provisional Joint Committee avas elected by the National Conference, and not by the trade unions and employers&apos; organisations. Certain very important groups of trade unions did not take part in the proceedings of the Committee, as, for instance, the miners, railway servants, transport workers, engineers and iron and steel workers, and the Committee, therefore, was not in a position to speak with authority for those bodies. At the outset the greater unions displayed opposition to the. proposal, and when, subsequently, the various organisa-tions Avere sounded by the labour side of the Joint Committee as to the promotion of a National Industrial Council, the response did not indicate that there was any large volume of opinion in favour of it, nor that the larger unions had in any wray departed from their original attitude, of opposition.10. It will be seen, therefore, that, while legislative action was taken in the direction of meeting certain of the recommendations of the Industrial Conference, it Avas not possible, to reach agreement as to similar action in the case of other important matters, nor was it found possible by the labour side of the Joint Com-mittee to secure the interest or support of the largest unions. In the circumstances, the Provisional Joint Committee on the 19th July, 1921, decided to tender its resigna-tion, and issued a statement in the following terms : &quot; The action taken by the Joint Committee to secure legislative effect to the. proposals contained in their Joint Report, as submitted to and unanimously approved by the second National Conference on the 4th April, 1919, and fully accepted in principle by the Government, together Avith the fact that legislative effect had not been given to these joint proposals, Avas discussed. Special con-sideration Avas giAren to the attitude taken up by the Government in the debates in Parliament, on the 27th May and the 1st July, folloAving on the motion of Mr. Barnes, on the Washington Conventions, and to the result which followed. It avas evident that the present position was such as to render futile any further efforts on the part of the Joint Committee to secure legislative effect to their joint recommendations. After careful consideration, the Committee unanimously decided that their resignation should be tendered, as no good purpose could be served by their remaining in being. The Chairman was accordingly asked to convey this to the Prime Minister and to the Minister of Labour.&quot;11. With the breakdown of the Provisional Joint Committee, the proposal to establish a National Industrial Council lapsed. Various suggestions have since been made both in Parliament and the Press that the Government should call a further National Industrial Conference, Lord Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, Sir Robert Hadfield, Mr. Arthur Henderson, Mr. Frank Hodges, Sir Nicholas Grattan Doyle and the Industrial League and Council being prominent among the supporters of the idea. The Government, however, has consistently taken the view that such a con-ference avould serve no useful purpose, and that it is for the representatives of employers and work-people in each industry to get together and hammer out a solution of their problems. As recently as March 1926 the Prime Minister said, in ansaver to a question in the House on the subject: &apos;&apos; I feel sure that the method of approaching the matter industry by industry is the most profitable one, and it seems to me a general conference of the kind proposed Avould not serve any useful purpose at the present time.&quot;[15812] b 2
12. The suggestion has since been revived in connection with the publicity which has recently been given in the Press and elsewhere to the. need for Industrial Peace. It may be noted, however, that Lord Weir, dealing with the Industrial Position in a motion before the House, of Lords on the 14th December, 1926, did not suggest, but even deprecated, new machinery. He said that for a return of our national prosperity and productivity there emerged two outstanding desiderata, namely, &quot;Peace, in industry,&quot; and the need for a combined effort on the part of employers and employed to secure by co-operation greater and more efficient produc-tion.   The best means to secure these desiderata was, in his opinion &quot; to bring together in one Council Chamber a few men capable of concentrating on the industrial necessities of the time, apart entirely from political con-siderations. Men of good intent not coming as delegates to voice an official policy dictated to them, not representing organisations, but coming together as practical men to seek a solution of practical questions.&quot;13. Since the beginning of 1927, Mr. C. T. Cramp and Mr. Arthur Henderson have pleaded for the setting up of an Industrial Parliament. Mr. Henderson put forward a proposal that the Prime Minister should invite Mr. Speaker to preside and request such bodies as the National Joint Council of the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party, and the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations to designate certain of their members to meet for an informal non-committal discussion^of the whole industrial situation. He suggested that the time was ripe for consideration of the question whether some permanent national body, an Economic Council or Parliament of Industry, should not be established.14. The proposal has had a mixed reception. Leading articles in the &quot; Daily Herald&apos;&apos; and the &quot; Morning Post&apos;&apos; have expressed disapproval, while the &quot; Manchester Guardian&quot; considers that Mr. Henderson&apos;s suggestion is a semi-official invitation to the Government and the employers which ought not to be declined; further, that an Industrial Parliament, especially if it had at its command a competent technical staff such as Mr. Henderson suggests, could hardly fail to do useful work, and, in so far as the spirit of goodwill is a reality and not a phrase, it might even tackle successfully some of those larger problems which are the main source of industrial friction and discontent.15. So far as Trade Unions are concerned, opinion is divided on the matter. Mr. Bevin, of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, and Mr. Appleton, of the General Federation of Trade Unions, are definitely opposed to the proposal. On the other hand, Mr. Clynes, Mr. Frank Hodges and Mr. Havelock Wilson are generally in favour. With regard to employers, Sir Stanley Machin thinks that such a body would be a splendid thing for industry, while Mr. W. A. Lee, of the Coalowners&apos; Association, has stated that &quot; such a body would only continue the political streak that runs through such organisations.&quot;16. The present interest in the suggestion for the re-creation of a National Industrial Conference is largely based upon the hope that such a body would assist in the settlement of industrial disputes and generally achieve an improvement in the relations between employers and emploj^ed, and would be able to render advice and effective assistance to the Government in dealing with industrial problems. In estimating the value of these possibilities the following considerations must be borne in mind : (1.) The failure of the last industrial conference is still fresh in the minds of many Trade Union leaders, who would view with considerable suspicion any action taken by the Government towards re-establishing such a conference.(2.) For a conference to be a success it must be fully representative of the Employers and the Unions. There is no unanimity either among Employers or Trade Unions in favour of a conference, and it is likely that, if such a conference were called, a number of important Employers&apos; organisations and Trade Unions would refuse to take part in it.(3.) In all the more important industries, there is already in existence conciliation and negotiating machinery for dealing with questions affecting wages, hours and conditions of employment. In many cases this machinery has been built up as the result of years of experience.(4:) The conditions vary very considerably in different industries, and industrial peace is much more likely to result from conferences between the Employers and Trade Unions in their own industries than from one huge and unwieldy conference embracing all industry.
(5.) Goodwill must develop from co-operation between the rank and file employers and their workpeople (for example, by - means of Works Committees) and cannot be imposed by an outside body.17. The constitutional aspect of the case must also be considered. The Conference of 1919, apart from being not fully representative, came to an end owing, finally, to the allegation that the Government had failed to give legislative effect to the recommendations of the Provisional Joint Committee on the matter of hours. It was urged against the Government that this was going back upon the acceptance by the Prime Minister of the Report of the Committee. Any National Conference resulting from the initiative of the Government would feel itself hampered and restricted if the Government failed to give effect to its agreed recommendations, and the Government would be embarrassed if they found themselves unable to agree to proceed with legislation formulated by the National Conference. A Conference resulting from voluntary agreement between the parties in industry and not formed on the initiative of the Government would be free from this embarrassment, although there is little doubt that if such a voluntary conference were established it would at once seek the recognition and goodwill of the Government. Its views would have considerable weight inside and outside Parliament, but the Government would be free from the responsibility for the Conference and would be able to put forward legislation or not as it might judge necessary in all the circumstances.18. To sum up, it is impossible to expect that a National Industrial Parliament would really be in a position to take effective action or to agree upon policy unless such a body were created on the initiative of the industries themselves. It is fair to assume that each industry would of necessity continue to settle conditions according to its own circumstances. The establishment of such a body by the action of an outside authority such as the Government would defeat its own object, and there is no reason to believe that either employers&apos; or workers&apos; organisations generally would welcome such a step. The right course appears to be to take every step possible in the various industries to encourage the formation of joint bodies, and to -strengthen them where they already exist, through which the employers and workers may co-operate in the settlement of working conditions and all other matters in which they have a common interest, and to allow any further steps such as the formation of a national body to be taken on the initiative of employers and workers at a time when they consider such a step to be desirable.19. Experiments have been made since the war in France and Germany in the establishment of standing bodies, widely representative of industrial interests, for the purpose of dealing with industrial or economic questions. Although these bodies appear to have certain features in common writh the National Industrial Council, whose establishment as a permanent body was suggested by the Provisional Joint Committee in 1919, they are not truly comparable, either in function or in constitution, with the National Industrial Conferences of 1918 and 1919, nor do the general observations set out in the immediately preceding paragraphs necessarily apply to them. Short accounts of their constitution and functions are included as a matter of interest in an appendix to this memorandum (Appendix II).[15812]
APPENDIX I.Industrial Conference, 1919. Summary of Recommendations of Provisional Joint Committee.Hours.(a.) The establishment by legal enactment of the principle of a maximum normal working week of forty-eight hours, subject to (b.) Provision for varying the normal hours in proper cases, with adequate safeguards.(c.) Hours agreements between employers and trade unions to be capable of application to the trade concerned. (d.) Systematic overtime to be discouraged, and. unavoidable overtime to bepaid for at special rates.Wages.(a.) The establishment by legal enactment of minimum time-rates of wages,to be of universal applicability. (b.) A Commission to report within three months as to what these minimum rates should be.(c.) Extension of the establishment of Trade Boards for less organised trades.(d.) Minimum time-rates agreements between employers and trade unions to be capable of application to all employers engaged in the trade falling within the scope of the agreement.(e.) Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918, to continue for a further period of six months from the 21st May, 1919.(/.) Trade Conferences to be held to consider how war advances, and bonuses should be dealt with, and in particular, whether they should be added to the time-rates or piece-work prices or should be treated separately as advances given on account of the conditions due to the war.Recognition of, &apos; and  Negotiations  between,  Organisations  of  Employers  and Workpeople.(a.) Basis of negotiation between employers and workpeople should be full and frank acceptance of employers&apos; organisations and trade unions as the recognised organisations to speak and act on behalf of their members.(&amp;.) Members should accept the jurisdiction of their respective organisations.(c.) Employers&apos; organisations and trade unions should enter into negotiations for the establishment of machinery, or the revision of existing machinery, for the avoidance of disputes, with provision for a representative method of negotiation in questions in which the same class of employers or workpeople are represented by more than one organisation respectively, and for the protection of employers&apos; interests where members of trade unions of workpeople are engaged in positions of trust or confidentially, provided the right of such employees to join or remain members of any trade union is not thereby affected.Unemployment.(1.) Prevention of Unemployment.(a.) Organised short time has considerable value in periods of depression. The joint representative bodies in each trade afford convenient machinery for controlling and regulating short time.(&amp;.) Government orders should be regulated with a view to stabilising employment.(c.) Government housing schemes should be pressed forward without delay. (d.) Demand for labour &quot;could be increased by State development of new industries.
(2.) Maintenance of Unemployed Workpeople.(e.) Normal provision for maintenance during unemployment should be more adequate and of wider application, and should be extended to under-employment.(/.) Unemployed persons, and particularly young persons, should have freeopportunities of continuing their education. (g.) The employment of married women and widows who have young children should be subject of a special enquiry. (A.) The age at which a child should enter employment should be raised beyondthe present limit.(i.) Sickness and Infirmity Benefits, and Old-Age Pensions require immediate investigation with a view to more generous provisions being made.National Industrial Council.(a.) A permanent National Industrial Council should be established to consider and advise the Government on national industrial questions.(b.) It should consist of 400 members, 200 elected by employers&apos; organisations and 200 by trade unions.(c.) The Minister of Labour should be President of the Council.(d.) There should be a Standing Committee of the Council numbering 50 members, and consisting of 25 members elected by and from the employers&apos; representatives and 25 by and from the trade union representatives on the Council.In an Appendix to the Report the trade union representatives on the Provisional Joint Committee set out in detail what they considered to be the causes of and the remedies for labour unrest. The causes fell under the following heads : 1. The lack of any comprehensive industrial or economic policy on the part ofthe Government or the employers. 2. The increasing desire on the part of the workers to substitute a democraticsystem of public ownership and production for use with an increasingelement of control by organised workers themselves for the existingcapitalist organisation of industry. 3. High prices. 4. Profiteering.5. Government policy in relation to industry. 6. Unemployment.7. Reductions in wages and earnings.8. Hours of employment.    Need for a reduction and abolition of systematicovertime. 9. Housing. 10. Recognition of trade unions.11. No adequate machinery capable of giving constant expression to theco-ordinated demands of the whole of the workers. 12. Attitude of Government and employers to grievances of the workers.APPENDIX II.The German Provisional Federal Economic Council.Probably the most important experiment in the establishment of a widely representative body for the express purpose of considering industrial and economic questions was that conducted in Germany. The Weimar Constitution provided for a Federal Economic Council. This was never set up, but a provisional Federal Economic Council was inaugurated in May 1920, with functions limited to advising the Government on social and economic questions, and to putting forward proposals on such questions. These powers were more restricted than those originally intended, but it was felt that the various political difficulties of the time rendered a temporary
arrangement necessary. The object of the establishment of the Council was at the time described as &quot;to take the burden of economic and technical questions off the Reichstag,&quot; and the Council was to have powers of initiative to propose Bills, as well as advisory powers. It was hoped that the Council would not be guided entirely by considerations of party expediency. The original proposal was that the repre-sentation should be upon a territorial basis, but it was eventually decided that representation should be based upon organised groups of industries, and the member-ship, originally intended to be 100, was thus increased to 326. The members were appointed by employers&apos; and workpeople&apos;s organisations, &quot;consumers&apos; organisa-tions,&quot; and the Government. Voting was to be by groups, but the returns were to show- in detail the majority and minority vote within the groups. For this purpose the. representatives were divided into nine separate groups. The day-to-day work was intended to be done by an executive committee of eighteen, and an economic committee and a socio-political committee, each of thirty members. All committees were to consist of one-third representatives of the employers, one-third workpeople and one-third consumers and professions.The CouncLVs functions were entirely advisory, and an American enquirer in 1922 reported that, in practice, the Government submitted appropriate draft Bills and programmes of contemplated action to the. Council, which made detailed reports and recommendations, and that Government Departments submitted current problems of importance to the Council for its views. Further, the Council on its own initiative took up enquiries on any subject it desired and submitted its views to the Government. This enquirer also said that the Council on occasion expressed both criticism and disapproval of various actions of the Government and the Depart-ments, and that when formal enquiries signed by at least thirty members were addressed to the Government, they were answered by the Chancellor in person before a full session of the Council. Possibly owing to its size, the Council tended to work by committees rather than in full session; thus, in its year from April 1921 to April 1922, twenty-nine full meetings avere held, but over seven hundred committee meetings took place. These committees dealt with a large number of different topics, the more important of which were land settlement, housing, tariffs, export duties, various aspects of taxation, the capital levy, reparation payments, Government credits, control of retail prices, improvement of labour statistics, hours of employment, &amp;c.Early in 1924, in connection with the reform of the currency, it became necessary to reduce, State expenditure, and steps were taken to reduce the membership and restrict the activities of the Economic Council. The Chairman was instructed not to summon a meeting without the approval of the Federal Government, and, though some of the committees continued their work, no meeting of the Council has been held since June 1923. There have been certain criticisms of this action, particularly from the Trade Unions, but it seems that for the present the activities of the Council are, to say the least, suspended, though there has recently been, a revival of activity on the part of the committees of the Council, certain of avhich have been considering Bills on such subjects as Accident Insurance.In view of this experience, man)&quot; observers, both German and others, consider the Council so far a failure, and various causes for this have been suggested. The most common criticisms are that the membership was too large and that the Council was not allocated functions of a sufficiently practical kind. It has also been con-tended that the CounciFs real mission was to become, through its machinery of standing Committees, a permanent expert consultative body, but that it became, in fact, a committee of enquiry avith parliamentary forms, and by not remaining so free from purely political controversy as was hoped, made opponents of those aadio feared the possibility of such a body tending to usurp some of the functions of Parliament. The extreme elements, both on the employers&apos; and AVorkpeople&apos;s side, disliked it as standing between them and their ultimate aims, so that eventually it avas supported only by the more moderate elements and by the more independent members. This, at a time when extreme political views were Avidely held, tended to Aveaken the CouncLVs position considerably.Those who continue to advocate such a Council hold that the experiment was too short, and that the, Council was slowly finding its proper place in the administrative machine Avhen its activities avere curtailed. Further, it is argued that the political reactions arising from the invasion of the Ruhr produced a situation in which it avas impossible for any such body to have a fair trial.In November 1926 the German Government introduced tavo Bills, the first pro-vicling for the, establishment of the permanent Federal Economic Council, and the
second containing the administrative regulations for its constitution. The Govern-ment, in drafting these Bills, endeavoured, in the light of the experience of the six years&apos; working of the provisional Council, to meet the. criticisms, which were directed against the provisional Council, and which are enumerated in the preceding para-graphs. As the permanent Council is to be established without the other bodies provided for in Article 165 of the. Constitution, the Bill involves a Constitutional amendment, and, therefore, will require a two-thirds majority in the Reichstag. The explanatory report of the Government attached to the Bill states that this fact will in no way prevent the later appointment of the other bodies provided for in the Constitution.The permanent Council is to differ in many important respects from the provisional one. In the first place, while its functions, in principle, are to remain the same, its influence will, in fact, be greater. If the Bill is passed in its present form, not -only Government Bills, but also Bills proposed by members of the Reichstag, must be laid before the Council, and, wherever possible, the Government must consider the views of the Council in drafting legislation. The reports of the Council must be submitted to the Reichstag and the Federal Council at the same time as the Bills are submitted. Delegates from the Council may also be called upon to give their views orally. Further, the right of the Council to propose legislation is made more effective by a clause which provides that the Government must bring such proposals before the Reichstag; if the Government disapproves of them, it can give its reasons and leave the discussion to the Reichstag. The Council may also send delegates to the Reichstag to speak in support of its proposals.The new Council is to have only 123 permanent members. But, as is stated in the explanatory statement of the Government, the two apparently conflicting aims, reduction of membership and a due regard for all the economic and social interests concerned, are to be reconciled by means of the enlistment of the services of non-permanent members, who may be called on to sit on committees or to deal with special matters. The non-permanent members have the right to vote. They are appointed by the Executive Committee of the Council.The group system of the old Council is to be largely abandoned, and the new Council is to consist of three Sections with 41 members each. The first represents the employers, and includes 13 representatives of agriculture, forestry, horticulture and fishing, 10 of industry, 4 of handicraft, 5 of commerce, 4 of banking and private insurance, and 5 of transport. The administrative regulations prescribe the bodies which are to nominate these members. The second section represents workers, manual and non-manual, to be nominated by the central Trade Union confederation-tions. At least 8 of the members in this section must represent agriculture and forestry, and 1 homeworkers; non-manual workers are to have adequate representation, and one non-manual worker must represent agriculture and forestry. The third section represents municipalities and rural communes, public insurance and credit institutions, co-operative societies, the press, officials and the liberal professions, while 8 of the members must be experts appointed by the&quot; Federal Government, and 8 be experts appointed by the Reichsrat from prominent persons in the various States of the Reich. The permanent members are appointed for a period of six years, half to retire at the end of every three years. They are intended to represent the &quot; entire economic life of the country,&quot; and are not bound by mandates from their nominators. The non-permanent members retire when the matters, for which they have been called in, have been dealt with.In the original Order, the full Council was made responsible for the main part of the work, but, in practice, this devolved more and more on the Committees. The new Bills recognise this historical development, and the full Council is to meet only on exceptional occasions, that is, when two-thirds of the executive committee so decide, or on the demand of the Federal Government or of two-thirds of the members of the Council.The Executive Committee is to consist of nine permanent members. There are to be three permanent main committees, the economic, the socio-political and the financial committees, to be elected annually by the sections. The membership is not to exceed 21 permanent members (one-third from each of the three sections), and 9 non-permanent members. Special committees may be appointed by the main committees with the consent of the executive committee. Permanent special committees require the approval of the Federal Government. The membership of special committees may not exceed 24, one-third from each section. The main committees may exercise all the powers of the Federal Economic Council, while the
special committees have only the right of making proposals. Both main and special committees may call in experts who are not members, and they are bound to hear the views of experts proposed by the Government.Another new feature is the Investigation Committee, which has wide powers, to deal with special inquiries. The results of its investigations must be submitted by the Federal Government to the Federal Economic Council, the Federal Council and the Reichstag.   They may also be published.The French National Economic Council.An interesting experiment was begun in France in July 1924, when the Minister of Labour appointed a Commission to prepare a programme for the establishment of a National Economic Council. The Minister stated that this body was to be a consultative one, and would be the technical adviser of the Government and of Parliament on important economic problems. The Commission reported in September, 1924, and in January, 1925, a National Economic Council was set up by Presidential Decree, to consist of 47 members, 9 representing municipal bodies, co-operative societies and various kinds of consumers, 28 representing wage-earning and salaried persons, 2 representing independent hand-craftsmen, and 8 representing capital. The members were to be nominated by organisations, but the organisations were to be chosen by the Government. A member was to be chosen for two years. Additional members might be co-opted. The Council was to meet four times yearly for ten days, or more frequently if called together on its own suggestion, and its day-to-day work was to be done by a permanent committee of ten members. The purjxjse of the Council was defined as that of investigating national problems and the submission to the Government of proposals for their solution. The Council is experimental, and is not intended to be in the nature of a parliament or even of an industrial chamber. It is to act in a purely advisory capacity, and to serve as a centre of information on economic questions.The Council is entitled to be heard by Ministers and by the Committees of the Chamber and the Senate, and both Ministers and Committees have the right to be represented on the Council. The Council will submit the results of its deliberations, either as reports or as recommendations, to the Prime Minister, who will either inform the Council within two months of the action taken, or will request that the question be examined anew. The Government will forward to the Council for consideration all Bills of an economic character, as well as draft administrative regulations of a similar kind.The Council held its first meeting on the 22nd June, 1925, with the Prime Minister in the chair. The Standing Committee met soon afterwards, and decided that one question should be thoroughly studied during each session, and that the next two meetings should be devoted to the housing problem. It is understood that the Standing Committee is also collecting information regarding the problem of national equipment, and the policy to be followed in regard to raw materials.The Council, a further session of which opened on the 8th February, 1927, is now preparing a Report for M. Poincare on the subject of unemployment.o
