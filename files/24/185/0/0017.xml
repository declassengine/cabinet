C R S T. 68 (27) .THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE    PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ICOPY NO.          BO C A B I M E T. -&quot; .BRUSSELS CONVENTION on Immunity of State-owned Ships.memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1,     I desire to bring before ray colleagues the present position of the above Convention with a view to obtaining their decision upon the question whether or not it should be ratified by His Majesty&apos;s Government.2.      The history of the Convention is shortly as follows:-The question of the immunity of State-owned ships was discussed at the Imperial Economic Conference in 1923.    For some years past, the view had been strongly held by shipowners and others that the immunity enjoyed by State-owned ships from liability at the suit of private individuals and from legal process for the purpose of enforcing that liability was open to grave abuse.    In the case of ships owned by the British Government it has always been the practice, without admitting any legal liability,  to assume responsibility for collision and salvage claims, and there is not and never has been any serious complaint on the part of ship-owning interests so far as the British Government is concerned.   But experience showed, especially during the War,  that many foreign Governments, while always ready to assert their Immunity from process in British Courts, made use of this immunity for the purpose of evading payment of just claims against them by private individuals.    The desirability of an International Convention to remove these difficulties has accordingly been strongly pressed upon successive Governments by the ship-owning interests and the Imperial Economic Conference in 1923 agreed that the demand was a reasonable one, and ought to be met, subject to such special limitations or safeguards as were necessary to protect Crown Interests.
3.    The question was further considered at a Meeting of the International Maritime Committee at Genoa in 1925, a Committee representative of shipowners in various countries though not attended by the official representatives of or in any way binding upon any Government.4.    In April 1926 a Conference to which the British Government sent delegates was held at Brussels on the invitation of the Belgian Government,  for the purpose of drawing up an International Convention to govern the subject for the future-    The chief Brn xiish delegate was Sir Leslie Scott.  K.C. . M.P.    Substantial agreement was seoiired at the Conference and a draft International Convention was drawn up and was signed ad referendum by the British delegates.5.    The various Government Departments concerned proceeded to examine the- draft Convention in order to ascertain whether it :-would  be recommended for acceptance as it stood by His Majesty s Government-,    The draft was a ?.sq brought last autumn io the attention of the Imperia;. - inference, which passed a resolution to the effect that]&apos; -&quot;The Imperial Conference- notes with satisfaction &quot;the steps taken to give effect to the policy approved &quot;at the Imperial Economic Conference in 1923 with regard &quot;to   the immunity of State-owned ships,  and,  subject to &quot;a satisfactory settlement of the points still out-&quot;Standing,  commends the draft International Convention &quot;drawn up at the Conference at Brussels in April 1926,  to &quot;the consideration of the Governments of the various &quot;parts of the Empire.&quot;6.    Criticisms on various points in the draft Convention were made by the Admiralty,  the Foreign Office and the Board of&apos;Trade,  and inter-departmental discussions took
place with a view to seeing how these criticisms could best be met.     As a result it was decided that certain amendments to and explanations of the text of the Convention should be embodied in a draft Supplementary Protocol ?nd submitted, to the Belgian Government with a request that that Government should endeavour to secure the assent thereto o  the other Governments represented at the Brussels Conference before any final vetificaticns were exchanged.     It was also decided that the legal advisers to the Admiralty and the Board of Trade should proceed to Brussels for the purpose of offering to the Belgian Government any explanations which they might require of the points dealt with in the draft Supplementary Protocol.7.     My colleagues will, be awar6 that for a considerable time past a Committee presided over by the Lord Chief Justice has been considering the question of the amendment of the law relating to proceedings by and against the Crown. I understand that this Committee are about to make their report, but that there is a considerable difference of opinion among the members of It ps to the desirability of certain amendments of the law in relation to the Crown as litigant which have from time to time been proposed.     It is clear that, though proceedings with regard to ships no doubt present special features of their own, yet the question of the admission of maritime claims against the Crown (as contemplated by the draft Convention) cannot be wholly divorced from that of the general liability of the Grown in tort, which I take to be the most disputable of the subjects under Investigation by the Crown Proceedings Committee.8.     The draft Supplementary Protocol has already been communicated to the Belgian Government, and I understand that the Belgian Government are not unfavourably disposed
tov/ards it; but before the two legal advisers proceeded to Brussels as arranged it seemed right, in the circumstances above mentioned, that the legal aspect of the draft Convention and of the Supplementary Frotocol should be brought to the notice of the Attorney General,  and this was accordingly done. I   understand that the Attorney General Is not wholly satisfied that the safeguards provided In the Convention itself and in the Supplementary Frotocol are adequate from the point of view of procedure,&quot;   but that he was also of opinion that the Convention itself represented so far-reaching a departure from the existing principles of English law that, without expressing any personal view as to the expediency of entering into such   an International Agreement-  it ought to be made the subject   of a Cabinet decision.9.    I have accordingly to ask my colleagues to consider (1) whether the principle of the draft Convention should be accepted, and (2) whether,  if the principle is accepted, the Convention should only be ratified provided that additional safeguards are introduced into the Supplementary Protocol which will be satisfactory to the Law Officers of the Crown.10.    I annex copies of the draft Convention and the draft Supplementary Protocol-P. C-L.Board of Trade,26th February, 1927.
