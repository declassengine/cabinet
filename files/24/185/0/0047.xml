fig,::POCUjgHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS -BRITANNIC MaJESTY?S GOVERWMENT-) .E C RE T ,COPY NO.CABINET.THE FRANCHISE QUESTION.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.I have been reading (In my retirement) my colleagues memoranda, and wish to add a few observationscI would have preferred to go slowly, but I think we are bound by the Home Secretary&apos;s definite statement on the 20th February,  1925 that &quot;the Prime minister&apos;s Pledge is for equal rights and at the next election.&quot;     The state-merit was made in the Prime Minister1s presence,  and not qualified by him;    and it was repeated by the &quot;.&apos;omenTs Deputation on the 8th March,  1927,  and was then (as I gather) accepted by the Prime Minister.But this does not mean that we must at once promise to introduce legislation for giving women the franchise at 21.      The Home Secretary on the 20th February,  1925, expressly refused to pre-judge the question of age,  and Insisted that there must be a conference of all parties; and I suggest that the Prime Minister should forthwith convene such a conference and request it to frame and submit a scheme of franchise reform upon the basis that equal franchise rights are to be conferred - upon men and women. The Speaker,  or him failing Lord Ullswater, might be pressed to select the members of the conference and to preside over it;    but if both refuse,  I suppose that the membership could be agreed.     The Conference might be asked to report this
Burnham,  19 March,  1927.It may be answered that such a conference can only have one result,  namely, a recommendation in favour of the franchise at 21,  and so-would be useless;    but is this certain?     Equal franchise can be reached by giving the vote to men and women at 25 (or 23), with a saving for existing rights;    and,  at a time when it is proposed to give the franchise for the first time to women under 30 and enormously to increase the number of voters,  it is not unreasonable that the whole question of age should be considered de novoo      If the Government were to propose without any preliminary conference to fix the voting age at 25, I do not doubt that the proposal would meet  with great and probably insuperable opposition)..   but If the proposal were made by an all-party Conference the position would be very different in any case the convening of a Conference would.be in accordance with all the Prime Minister!s pledges,  would to some extent mitigate the soreness of those man?/ Conservatives who would prefer to have no Immediate change, and- would be an answer to any demand for legislation in this Session..0.
