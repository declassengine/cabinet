Printed for the Cabinet, March, 1927.SECRET.Cory No.cp. .69 (27).THE CABINET.INDIAN WAR SETTLEMENT.JOINT MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.   &apos;The India Office, the War Office and the Ministry&apos; of Pensions have been at issue for a long period over a number of outstanding war claims on either side. Careful and prolonged endeavours to find a common point of view have failed to reconcile the differences between them.   The main items in question are enumerated in Lists A and B attached.The largest item is the claim upon India (see List A) to bear a share of the casualty pensions during the Great War of the British troops who had previously served in India. This and certain complicated non-effective questions in relation to the &quot; Further Contribution &quot;towards the cost of the war which had been conditionally offered by India and a portion of which had been provisionally paid subject to Parliamentary sanction, were considered in 1920 by a Committee over which Mr. Baldwin (then Financial Secretary to the Treasury) presided. This Committee formulated the claims on both sides in regard to these matters, but did not make any recommendation. The broad facts as regards the casualty pensions are as follows : The payments made annually by India in respect of the pension charges of the British troops on her establishment are governed by an agreement made in 1870, which lays down that the Indian Government shall bear the proportion of the pension charge&apos;fbr each officer or man due to the service rendered to it.   In previous wars (including notably the South African War) the terms of this agreement had, except in the case of wound pensions, been applied as if the intention were that the charges should be divided between the two Governments in the proportion of the respective periods spent in their service ; and, if that practice were followed, India would automatically he liable for a share of the casualty pensions of the Great War.    India, however, prior to August, 1914, had questioned the propriety of applying this practice to pensions specifically arising out of war service, and she  has  since  strongly represented  that its  application&apos;  in  the circumstances of the Great War would throw upon her&apos; a charge indisputably due directly to the War, amounting in the gross to  40 millions^ and she has urg-ecl that such a result would not be within the spirit of the 1870 agreement and would&apos; be inequitable to India and constitute an infringement of the Government of India Act. The Secretary of State for War and the  Minister of&quot; Pensions&apos; admit that there is much to he said for the Indian point of view, and after much discussion and having regard to the acceptance by India, in connection with the &quot;Further Contribution&quot; referred to above, of the casualty pensions of Indian troops employed in the War, they have felt constrained to withdraw this claim.As regards the first item in List B, the claim for half the cost of the expenditure in South and East Persia, it is agreed that this region is sufficiently close to India to render her far from indifferent to the presence there of a protecting force. On the other hand, it is definitely outside the confines of India, and India urged that the campaign was undertaken on Imperial initiative, that it formed part of the general Allied operations, towards the cost of which the Government of India had contributed by meeting the ordinary charges of the troops despatched from fchat country and by additional grants amounting to&apos; over 114 millions, and that these several contributions must be held to cover any special interest that she had in this particular phase of it. The Secretary of State for War admits that there is weight in these arguments.(b26/17)   100   3/27   w.0 i&apos;.   2sg4
As against these two principal claims on the Imperial side, there are three main Indian claims, List B, Items 4, 7 and 10.The first of these, Item 4, the cost of redaction of surplus officers of the Indian Army, arises from the fact that a large number of the commissions in the Indian Army given during the Great War were permanent and not (as in the corresponding case of the British Army) temporary ; the terms which had to be granted on reduction were accordingly much higher than they would otherwise have been. The India Office case is that it would have been impossible to secure a sufficient number of officers of the right stamp for service in the Indian Army without giving these permanent commissions, and that the War Office were cognisant of what was happening : the War Office, on the other hand, contend that it is not clear that a larger number of temporary commissions might not have been given, and that the full facts were not placed before them. The claim advanced by India is for only a share of the full cost incurred, which amounted in all to some  1,630,000. The War Office would have been prepared to pay a substantial sum, but not as much as would have satisfied India.The Indian claim of  2,500,000 for arrear war expenditure at Aden, List B, Item 7, represents approximately the amount by which the payments actually made by the War Office fall short of half the ordinary cost, plus the total extraordinary cost, of Aden from the date in 1917 when India handed over the military control. The India Office do not press for the full amount under the item and the War Office are prepared to make some concession.The claim arising from the wrong rates of exchange stated to have been used for certain accounts, List B, Item 10, was advanced at a very late date by India, and it has not been fully examined by the War Office. The India Office are satisfied that it is correct, but in view of the fact that it arose after the negotiations for settlement had reached an advanced stage and on accounts which had already been certified as correct by India, the Secretary of State for War does not consider that much weight should be attached to it.The other claims included in List B are of less value. The Secretary of State for War is prepared to waive the claim on Item 2 (demobilisation charges), as certain similar claims on India&apos;s side are compounded in List A, but he pi^esses for full payment under Item 3 (reduction of British troops in India) and Item 8 (reassessment of pensions), and refuses to admit any liability under Item 6 (Indian Families Pension Funds) ; under Item 5 (adjustments for the year 1919-20) he is prepared to compromise so far as to limit his claim to Sea Transport only (some  312,000 out of the total of  1,098,000). He does not consider that much weight should be attached to the two claims under Item 9.The items in List C fall into a different category from the others. This list consists of certain non-effective payments between the departments, which can be more conveniently dealt with in connection with the present settlement.than year by year in the course of the running Indian non-effective account. They are not in dispute, and it is not necessary to trouble the Cabinet with the details.After very full discussion and consideration of the merits of the several claims the Secretary of State for War (who acted also on behalf of the Minister of Pensions) and the Secretary of State for India in Council have arrived at the basis of settlement set out below, the effect of which is that no further payments are to be made by either side to the other in respect of the matters covered. Each regards the settlement as representing something substantially less than what is due from the other Department, but they agree in the view that it is as equitable as any likely to be reached by further controversy.The settlement provides that no further claims arising out of the war shall be preferred on either side.The sanction of Parliament will be sought at an early date for the further -contribution of  14^ millions by India referred to above, and for such further expenditure by India involved in the settlement, as under the terms of the Government of India Act, requires such sanction.The terms of settlement have been put by the Secretary of State for War to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, at whose request the matter is now brought before the Cabinet.L. W.-E. B.1st March, 1927.
1. Certain claims arising out of or associated with, the Great War which have been preferred by the War Office or Ministry of Pensions and by the India Office, respectively, but have either been rejected or not accepted in full by the other side, are enumerated in the annexed Lists A and b. Certain non-effective adjustments not in dispute but included in the settlement are enumerated in List C.2. The Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Pensions have now agreed -with the Secretary of State for India in Council : (1) That, without prejudice to any question of principle involved, these claims and adjustments shall, without further payment on either side, be regarded as settled.(2) That the payments made by India for Sea Transport and Home Effective Charges in respect of the periods 1st April, 1914, to 31st March, 1925, and 31st March, 1926, respectively, shall stand as final. An advance of  334,000 originally made by the India Office in respect of Sea Transport, but not hitherto brought to account by the War Office, shall remain in the hands of the latter.(3) That all minor War Claims already raised shall similarly be regarded as covered by this Settlement.(4) That no further claims arising out of the War shall be preferred on either side. (5) That the application of this Settlement shall be as may be laid down in the detailed Agreement now under discussion between the War Office and the India Office.3. The broad lines of division of non-effective expenditure will be as follows : (a) To be borne by India (i) All the casualty pensions due to the War granted to personnel of the Indian Army and their dependants.(ii) All other non-effective awards to personnel of the Indian Army and their dependants made during the period 1st April, 1914, to 31st March, 1919.(iii) The share of all ordinary non-effective charges in respect of personnel of the Indian Armyand their dependants attributable to service in the period 4th August, 1914, to 31st May, 1919.(b) To be borne by the Imperial Government  By the Ministry of Pensions All the casualty pensions due to the war granted to personnel of the British Army and their dependants.By the War Office (i) All non-effective awards (other than war casualty pensions) to personnel of theBritish Army and their dependants made during the period 1st April, 1914, to 31st March, 1919.(ii) The share of all ordinary non-effective charges in respect of personnel of the british army and their dependants attributable to service in the period 4th August, 1914, to 31st March, 1920.statement of claims covered. list a. baldwin committee items.
