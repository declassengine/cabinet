L&quot;(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government). SECRET.CABINET. ...CP.  89(27). _ ;   4?THE FRANCHISE QUESTION. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.(1) The Chancellor of the Exchequer in his memorandum(CP.80(27))  suggests that had it not been for my statement in the House on the 20th February,  1925,  the Government would be under no obligation to legislate on this subject before the next  election.      He interprets the declaration made by the Prime Minister in 1924 as meaning that while the Unionist Party &quot;are in favour of equal political rights for men and women&quot;  as an abstract principle, we are under no obligation to take any practical steps during the life of the present Parliament beyond setting up a Conference at which we can render disagreement certain by limiting beforehand the discretion of our representatives and after which we can justify inaction by the plea that an agreement was not reached.I cannot think that this interpretation is consistent with the reputation of the author of the declaration, but in any case the question of the date at which the Government should implement the Prime Minister&apos;s declaration was one of the questions before the Cabinet on the 18th February,   1925,  and as shown by the Cabinet Minute and by the terms of the Government amendment moved in the House after the Cabinet discussion, the decision was &quot;that a considered scheme of franchise reform should be brought before this House at a suitable opportunity within the lifetime of the present Parliament.&quot;The amendment containing the words &quot;within the lifetime of the present Parliament&quot; was moved by myself on behalf of the Oovernment and was recommended to the House by the Prime Minister in his speech at the close of the debate.
v : &quot;* . ,  227My statement that effect would be given to the principle of equal political rights &quot;before the next election1 was not &quot;a chance utterance in the pressure of debate of a single Minister speaking beyond Cabinet authority&quot; .      It was an expression of a decision embodied after a Cabinet discussion in a formal amendment placed on the Order Paper by the Government and recommended to the House by the Prime Minister in person who spoke in its favour and by whose orders the government whips were put on.I agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that &quot;unless we are convinced on merits that absolutely equal rights for both sexes at the next election would be in the main interest of the British nation and Empire we ought without losing time to re-state our position in Parliament.&quot; Clearly if we were wrong to hold out hopes that wonen would be given equal political rights with men,  the sooner we say so the better;    but I cannot agree with the view that it would be disastrous to give effect before the next election to a principle which,  as the Chancellor of the Exchequer says, &quot;is not disputed today by any important section of public opinion&quot;  and to which,  as he recognises,  effect must be given at some future date.      I am not convinced that the electoral consequences would be such as the Chancellor of the Exchequer anticipates:      but I am convinced that the consequences for our Party would be most unfortunate if we were to attempt to maintain the position that while equal franchise is right in principle, action to give effect to this principle must be deferred until such time as the Labour Party has developed into a &quot;trustworthy though unpalatable alternative administrative instrument&quot;.      The surest way to lose votes at an election is for a Party to show that it has not the courage of its convictions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recognises that the only alternatives to a bold acceptance of a franchise for
women at the age of 21 are either  (a)  to raise the age of men,  - a policy to which the vital objections have been explained in the memorandum from the Central Conservative Office;    or  (b) to whittle down the pledge in a manner which seems to me quite indefensible by merely giving the franchise to women over 30 on&apos;the same terms as men.     The latter policy would,  I believe, be regarded almost universally as a disingenuous evasion. (4) The Chancellor&apos;s forebodings are based, partly at anyrate,  on the consideration that a Redistribution Bill would be inevitable in the present Parliament.      I have circulated a detailed statistical memorandum - CP.81(27)- which makes it clear that any case for redistribution rises solely out of the existing conditions and would not in any way be strengthened by adding to the electorate women between the ages of 21 and 30.      The Chairman of the Party tells me he is definitely against redistribution and is of opinion on the figures that &quot;if redistribution could be resisted now, and it could be, it could be as well resisted in the event of women being given the vote at 21&quot;.      I agree with this vi ew.(5)The Chairman of the Party and the Central Office now take the view -&quot;that however much the extension of the franchise to&quot;women of 21 years of age may adversely affect us in&quot;certain parts of the country,  it is advisable that&quot;the Government should,  to use a colloquialism,  &quot;go&quot;the whole hog&quot;.If the Conservative Party only givea limited franchise there is a grave danger that&quot;should the Socialist Party come into office at the&quot;next election they will do two things  (l) they will &quot;give one man and one woman the vote at 21,  i.e. &quot;universal suffrage,  and  (2)  it is more than likely
14th March,  1927.&quot; they would give every person on the Parliamentary &quot;register the right to vote at local elections &quot;which would mean representation without paying &quot; taxation&quot; .These are important considerations in favour of a bold policy of giving votes to women at the age of 21 on the same terms as men.      This is the clear,  logical and honourable course,  and if we adopt this policy without equivocation or timidity,  I do not believe we shall have any cause for regret..&apos;/. J . H .
