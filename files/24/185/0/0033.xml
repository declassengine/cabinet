jBIS EOCUIiENT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT) .S E C R E T. O--- C A B IE, E I. COPY NO.    d 0Co?&quot;84(27) * &quot;THE FRANCHISE QUESTION *Me mo r and urn by th;e Pre si dent of th e^ Boar d of Education.    ----- -I do a at wish to argue this question on paper, hut inorder to state the issue fairly some additions should, I think he,   me.de to the Chancellor of the Exchequer7s summing up2, 7)It is true that the Prime Ministers declaration at the General Election did not In terms commit the Government to any particular action within the lifetime of the present Parliament other than the convening of a Speaker1 s Conference.     But this declaration cannot he detached from its &quot;background-    To go no further back, every Conservative member of the House of Commons was deeply pre-occupled throughout the Session of 1924 by the Labour Party xs Franchise BilloThe views of the party organisations were the same then as now andas -were/well known.    The risks of a great extension of -the franchise wereobvious but It soon became evident that, glad as Conservative members might have been to postpone the  issue,  they were not prepared to identify themselves with any strong opposition to the Bill.    On theSecond Reading on February 29th the present Secretary of State forthe Dominions said that the Bill &quot;is based as regards its main.feature on a principle which 7&quot; think is endorsed to-day by a greatmajority in this House, namely, that -there should not be any differentiation in respect of age as between men and women -voters&quot;.    He wenton to say that it might be argued that so large an extension of the franchise &quot;should be accomplished possibly by stages - possibly bysome further measure of delay.    But, broadly speaking, I think themajority of the House would feel that such differentiation should be abolished and that there is no real reason why there should be,  atany rate,  a long delay&quot;.      In winding up the debate for the Oppositionthe present Solicit or-General said:- &quot;I hope women may be given the vote at the age of 21 and may exercise it in the same way as men haveexercised it.&quot;     When the Bill got into Committee,  the reluctant-tance of- 1-
the party to oppose or obstruct it was so strong that we wore obligedto make an offer to the promoters of the Bill.     That offer wss that if they would introduce amendments confining the Bill purely to tho point of sex equality, we should be prepared to discuss it   (to quote my words on that occasion) as &quot;the means of carrying out a principle with which,  I suppose, nine-tenths of us on every bench in this Committee are agreed, namely, the equalisation of the franchise as a matter of principle by some stages and at some date&quot;.     when, however, it came to the question of &quot;stages&quot;, an amendment postponing the change until the first register of 1926% was opposed by a number of Conservative members and had to be with-drawn at their urgent request.      A typical statement in this debate was that of Mr. Iamb, the Member for Stone:-&quot;I am pledged to equality between men and women as regards the franchise,    but I am not pledged as to any particular age.      1 see no valid reason why the matter should be postponed and I believe the proposal to extend the date to 1928 is unreasonable&apos;\     Another amendment to fix the age at 25 for both sexes was also opposed by a number of Conservatives.Of course, none of these statements are binding on the party,  or on the present Government.      They merely indicate the temper of the party and the public position in which they had placed themselves or into which they had dxifted in the months before the General Election.      The Prime Minister1s declaration at that election excited comparatively little interest &quot;because it was widely assumed, both by the electorate and by Conservative candidates, not  only that the principle of equality had passed beyond controversy, but that the carrying out of that principle could not he longer postponed.      The only practical question left was whether the age should be 25 or 21.
It was surely In the same atmosphere that tho Cabinet discussed its attitude towards the Private l.IemborTs Bill in February,  1925.      I will not set my recollection of that discussion against that of any of my colleagues but, however cautiously worded tho Minute may have been,  I certainly did not gather that there was any open question in my colleagues minds except that of the age at which equality should be given.      As the Chancellor points out,  if any of us bad had any other idea in our mind we should certainly have protested immediately afterwards against the Home Secretary?s explicit statement in debate.The interpretation of political pledges will always be a matter of opinion, but the moral of a party is a question of fact.      It is one thing to extricate your forces by bold generalship from a position which they feel to   be untenable; it is quite another thing to ask them suddenly to make a voltei face when all that they expect from that manoeuvre is exposure to a galling flank fire.      The question is which of these two metaphors best fits the position of our party at the present moment?     On past experience,  does the Conservative Party &quot;ever feel comfortable when fighting a doubtful or ambiguous issue? Does it not feel that it can neither compete with the Labour Party in rhetoric nor with the Liberal Party in dialectic -that its chances of success lie always in simple statement and. a plain record?     ilo on;   can pretend, to interpret the feelings of a whole party, but there is no doubt that many Conservative members would infinitely prefer to run the risks of an extended franchise that the risks of an election fought on what appears to them a shaky and ambiguous platform.      They either do not&quot;. agree, as I do not. with the long-standing apprehensions of the party organisation, or they have already discounted them,,
There remains the question whether there are weighty reasons, apart from any mere calculation of electoral prospects, which would foe regarded by our party as providin them with a sound fighting platform for delayo      The only possible consideration of this kind is the necessity for re-distribution!    but it is easy to see how uncom-comfortable would be our argumentative position if we advanced this as a reason for delay..     Ho urged re-distribution in the debates on the 1924 Bill, and an amend-inent to this effect, was, in fact, the only one which secured the united support of Conservatives in Committee * Can we argue now that the point to which we professed to attach such importance three years ago had escaped our attention until this moment?      Can we say that re-distribu-tion cannot be effected before the next election?      Or are we to commit ourselves to the syllogism:    equal franchise necessitates re-distribution;    re--distribution is undesirable;    therefore, equal . franchise is undesirable? Our only possible position that, though we had foreseen re-distribution as the inevitable concomitant of equal franchise, there are weighty considerations of policy which render it desirable to postpone re--distribution for four-, but not for more than four years;&quot;   and I fear it will be difficult to explain the nature of those considerations in a manner which will be satisfactory either to our followers or to the electorate0Hi o P 0Board of Education,,11th March, 1927.
