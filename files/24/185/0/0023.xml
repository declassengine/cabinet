SECRET.CP. 74 (27)Printed for flie Cabinet.    March 11)27. jCopy No.    qCABINET. Indian War Settlement.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. (Previous Papers : CP. 09 (2-7) and CP. 70 (27).)The Chancellor of the Exchequer lias made a very powerful appeal for arbitration, and I must answer it as best I. can. First of all, however, I must make clear exactly what, is the attitude which-the Council of India have consistently adopted, and for this purpose I cannot do better than quote at some length from a letter written by my predecessor, Lord Peel, on 13th May 1922. to tho Secretary oil State for War : &quot;The real difficulty is that of determining, at India&apos;s present stage of progress towards self-government, the extent to which it is permissible and expedient for His Majesty&apos;s Government to impose charges on India for Imperial purposes without the consent of the Indian representative bodies.It is suggested in the preamble of the draft terms of reference prepared by the War Office that the disputes between the Home Government and India are &apos; of a kind which if they arose between the Home Government and a Dominion Government would be decided by some form of arbitration, if the ministers concerned failed to reach agreement after discussion.&apos; Is this altogether correct ? Are there not certain classes of cases which the Dominions would refuse to put to arbitration? For example, it has on occasion been suggested that the Dominions should properly bear a due proportion of the cost of naval defence ; or that Australia and New Zealand should contribute towards the cost of Aden. But surely they would never agree to arbitrate on a keenly disputed claim of this type. The difficulty in reaching a settlement in the outstanding disputes arises from the fact that in these the ultimate issue is the same, namely, the question of the extent of India&apos;s liability in some form or another for the cost of Imperial defence.I freely admit, however, that there are many cases of dispute between a Dominion and Home Government in which an amicable settlement is readily arrived at. A Dominion Premier has a majority in his Legislature, and can therefore speak for the Legislature as a whole and, with practical safety, enter into engagements binding them. On the other hand no one would expect him to enter into any undertaking which his Legislature would not endorse.The Government of India are in a small minority in their Legislature.- It follows, therefore, that an assent given by the Secretary of State in Councillor even by the Government of India, does uot necessarily carry with it the assent of the Legislature.This, then, 1 take to be the position as regards the Dominions : first, that their Governments can and do negative absolutely certain classes of demands, and secondly, that, so far as they come to terms, they do so with the assurance of. the assent of their Legislature. The question is how far India is entitled to similar advantages and safeguards.Under the constitutional changes introduced in India by the Act of 1919, while the Secretary of State retains his responsibility to Parliament in certain matters, a large measure of self-government has been deliberately granted to India by Parliament, particularly in regard to fiscal matters. In this connection I would particularly invite your attention to the tone and spirit of the observations of the Joint Select Committee on clause 33 of the Government of India Bill. I read them as implying that in matters so closely affecting the separate interest and concern of the British Government there was no possible means of securing India&apos;s confidence in that Governments good faith except by leaving India free to take her own line in the particular fiscal matters there in question. Do not precisely the same considerations apply to the present issues, and would not the Joint Select Committee&apos;s pronouncement have probably been the same if these issues had been equally prominently before them ?I feel quite sure that it is far from the intention of the Council to take up in any way an obstructive or unreasonable attitude. They would agree to arbitration wherever they possibly could.   They feel, however, that there are certain questions,1S30       100   2.27
any forced settlement of which must lead to most violent agitation, and possibly even, as in the past, catastrophe and that the only right course is to act in these matters * Vide in this connection last part of with the constitutional assent of the Government, para. 5 of Government of IndiVs telegram i.o. in the present case with the combined assent, of 14th January 1922, which was circa- 0f the Government of India and the Indian lated to Cabinet. Legislature.   This of course is not a new prin-ciple, as even before the introduction of the recent constitutional reforms, the concurrence of the Indian Government and Legislature was secured to the &quot; normal cost &quot; contribution, to the  100,000,000 contribution and to India&apos;s further contribution towards the cost of the war. The position taken up by my Council is that it is incumbent on them in such a case as the  40,000,000 claim to employ their statutory power of vetoing expenditure in a way which will lead either (a) to a prior reference to the Government of India and the Indian Legislature, or (b) to the assumption by His Majesty&apos;s Government directly of the responsibility of dispensing with such a reference ; for the British Government has of course in the last resort a power of action in spite of the awkward jjosition which section 21 of the Government of India Act may be used to bring about.&quot;If the Indian Legislature was so consulted and agreed either to (a) acceptance of such a claim, or (6) partial acceptance - of the claim by way of compromise, or (c) arbitration, the Council of India would not stand in the way of any of these solutions.&quot;Perhaps this letter was not brought to the Chancellors notice when he wrote his memorandum; at all events he does not d-eal with the considerations which it urges. But I think my colleagues will agree that the Indian case here stated is not essentially unreasonable, and there is little that I need add.I grant that since 1922 the idea of arbitration has made progress in the Avorld at large, and that the last Imperial Conference has carried it a stage further forward in the Empire. But when it is argued that if India were self-governing she would be morally bound to submit to arbitration, surely IiidiVs reply (which we have heard often enough in other connections) is : &quot; Make me self-governing and I will show you what I will do. Meanwhile, you cannot have it both ways hold me in subjection and at the same time claim all the benefits that I might confer if I were self-governing. And until you make that gesture, I shall insist on the pound of flesh which the constitution gives me.&quot; &quot; Which the constitution gives &quot; that is the point. At the first glance it may seem that we have merely drifted into an impasse, and that it is a scandal that, two great, departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be able to wrangle indefinitely and that there should be no solution except the surrender of one of them. But this is no accident. It must be taken to have been the deliberate intention of Parliament, when it passed the Government of India Act in 1S5S and left it unamended in this respect ever since, to enable an independent body like the Council of India to prevent the British Government from imposing charges at will on Indian revenues. And when the Chancellor speaks of taking a Cabinet decision, let me remind him that the only decision which the Cabinet can take (if it wishes to pursue the question) is whether it will or will not amend the Government of India Act or, by an address of both Houses of Parliament, remove the Members of my Council from their office.That is the constitutional position. And if we look at the prospect as practical men, what advantage can we expect to obtain by following the course which the Chancellor advocates ? The main substance of the War Office claim is on account of pensions a sum of about 25 millions net. Over this there can be no compromise  an arbitrator must give it either for or against India in toto, and if the case went against India that would be the smallest charge that she could be required to assume. Does anyone for a moment suppose that she either could or would assume it? It is idle, for the Treasury to compare Indian debt with British debt. The fact is that India over and above her other war contributions made to the British Government a cash present of  100,000,000, and it is indisputable that she would not have done so if she had expected that she would be faced 10 years-later with a claim for  40,000,000, or even for  25,000,000. What will be the effect on the political relations between us  already none too happy of facing her with it now ? What is the probability that the Indian Legislature will vote the necessary funds ? And if they refuse shall we not all be the worse off by the amount of ill-will that will have been provoked ?I would earnestly- beg my colleagues to leave matters where they are. The Secretary of State for War, approaching the problem in a statesmanlike spirit, lias
readied an agreement with me. It satisfied neither party which according to Anglo-Saxon ideas is the very hall-mark of a successful compromise but at least it does not create an acute political crisis. Let us be content. But if my colleagues insist, there are two alternatives : that which the Council of 1 ndiaindicated in Lord Peel&apos;s letter  arbitration with the previous assent of the Government of India and the Legislative Assembly and that proposed by the Chancellor arbitration without previous consent, but. equahy without obligation to abide by the result. Of the two I strongly prefer the former ; not only because it does greater justice to the constitutional position, but also because the mere presentation of the claim as an arbitral award would bring equal odium on His Majesty&apos;s Government, whether it is pressed or not and would rally all Indian parties against us. But while I regard neither alternative as likely to lead to any useful result, I am prepared, if so required, to consult the Viceroy as to the choice between them.BIRKENHEAD.3rd March 1927.
