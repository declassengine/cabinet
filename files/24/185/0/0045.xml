In the main they relate to persons who had claims to benefit current and were not at work on the dates given.(2.) The latest figure available, viz., for the week ended the 14th March, 1927, is given in Part (D) of this Report.The percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the undermentioned dates was February 23, 1925     .... .... .... ....   11*122, 1926     .... .... .... ....   10-121,1927     .... .... .... ....  10*8, (men only 12-4)The table given above shows that during the four weeks ended the 28th February the number of persons registered as unemployed decreased by 162,060. February is normally a month in which seasonal improvement in industry takes place, but last month&apos;s reduction in unemployment was more than twice as great as that which took place during February of last year. Whilst the numbers on the registers are still appreciably higher than at this time last year, it is interesting to note that the number of women unemployed is now less than, it was a year ago;. This is doubtless largely accounted for by the improvement in the textile trades.&quot; [15919]

Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 21st February, 1927, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 10&quot;9, as compared with 12*1 at the 24th January, 1927, with 10&apos;4 at the 22nd February, 1926, and with 11&apos;3 at the 23rd February, 1925. The figures at the 21st February, 1927, in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month, with the 26th April, 1926, and with a year ago are given in the table below : 	Number of Insured Persons	Increase (4-	) or	Decrease (-	-) compared	Industry.	recorded as Unemployed			with 			at Feb. 21, 1927.

It is particularly noteworthy that in no insured industry has there been an increase in unemployment of 2,000 or over.The improvement has been most marked in building and cotton. In the former trade the reduction in unemployment was largely seasonal in nature, but part of it was doubtless brought about by the increasing availability of cou-structional material. The increase in activity in cotton was most in. evidence amongst firms in the weaving departments, largely as the result of the demand of some of the chief Indian markets. The position in the American spinning section, however, also showed some improvement, whilst it is reported that in the Egyptian section practically full-time running continued. In shipbuilding, engineering and other allied industries unemployment continued to remain severe, notwithstanding the fact that some further improvement took place during the month. It is noteworthy, however, that at the end of the month there were more blast furnaces in operation than at the end of February last year, whilst the
output of pig-iron and steel, despite the shorter month, was greater than during January. The improvement in tailoring shows that the seasonal recovery in this trade has begun to set in.Very little change took place in coal mining; in Durham and Wales appreciable numbers of men remain unemployed.(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figure of unemployment published is that for the 14th March, giving the total number on the registers as 1,118,700. This is a decrease over the position on tjhe 28th February amounting to 50,783, and an increase over a year ago of 47,857.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,March 23, 1927.
