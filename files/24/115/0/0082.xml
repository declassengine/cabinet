324\THIS DOCUMENT IS THS PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMKIT. \  j       HpUsin&amp; and Unemgloyment.^/memorandum by  the Minister of Health.CABINET.H.22.The Second Interim Report of the Cabinet Committee  onIMS  Unemployment puts forward two alternative suggestions as a     basis for an agreement with the building trade unions for the    - augmentation of the skilled men in the building trade by a     number of men which, taken in combination with the  adult     apprentices to be admitted under the scheme of the  Building     Resettlement Committee, would amount to 50,000.           I trust that the Cabinet may see fit to approve an     agreement on the lines proposed by the Minister of  Labour which,     judging from the interviews between myself and representatives     of the building trade, are the least terms at all likely to be     accepted by the unions.           While I share to the full the views of my, colleagues     on the Unemployment Committee as to the case for absorbing     unemployed Ex-Service men in the building trade, my own     ministerial responsibility is the provision of an increased     supply of labour for the housing schemes.  Prom that point of     view I would urge the Cabinet when dealing with the Second     Interim Report of the Unemployment Committee to consider the     situation which will result if an agreement with the building     trade unions cannot be obtained.           The view has been freely expressed, that it will be possible,     without the co-operation of the trade unions, to absorb a large     number of men in the skilled ranks in the building trade and to     provide for the necessary training of such men in one way or     another.           I have explored  the possibility of such a step in     consultation with various large building and construction     contractors.   The impression made on my mind as a result of     these conversations was that, although it might be possible
   to obtain small numbers of trainers without the co-operation of   the unions, it would Without such co-operation bo Impossible   to deal with training on any such scale as would within any reasonable   time give appreciable help in solving the question of the unemployed   ox-service man or as would make any material contribution to the labour   difficulty on the housing schemes.        Further I have discovered that there is very strong objection   on the part of local authorities to be parties to any proposals for   the augmentation of the skilled ranks of the building trade except   by agreement with the trado unions.        It follows that unless such agreement can bo obtained any   augmentation scheme will run a serious risk of being a fiasco.        There is also of course the consideration that if such a scheme   is set on foot without agreement with the trade unions the increased   progress on housing schemes which has recently been experienced may   be stopped, either by deliberate action on the part of the trade unions   in reducing output, or in opposing the allocation of men to housing   schemes, or possibly by a complete withdrawal of labour from such   schemes. ,        It is to be remembered that the housing schemes, employ but a small   proportion of the building labour of the.country and that labour with-   drawn from them could probably be readily absorbed on other work, which   there is some reason for thinking is more acceptable to the men them-   selves.        I think that these considerations should be in tho minds of tho   Cabinet when they consider the Second Interim Report of the Cabinet   Committee on&apos;Unemployment,                                    C. ADDISON.                                               26.11.20.i   i  ; 1:  . I I   l   , ,                                          ,       1    .Ministry&apos; of Health..
