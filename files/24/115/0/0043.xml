                 EXPLANATORY STATEMENT.     Tho draft amendments to Articles XII, XIII and :rv o &apos; thoCovenant of  the Loafoue of Nations and the draft Annex to theCovenant,.submitted by tho Norwegian Government, Which aim at tho creation of Conciliation and Arbitration Commissions,wore drawn up by the Norwegian Government Committee in collaboration with Swedish end Danish Committees.   TheSwedish Government Adopts the view of these committees,according to which tho investigation of international disputes,not submitted to a Court of Arbitration or to the PermanentCourt of International Justice should be undertaken in thefirst plaee, not by, the Council or tho Assembly, as laid downby the present Covenant, but fey commissions, previouslyappointed, consisting of an impartial president and of an equal number of members to be nominated by the parties to thodispute.  Objection might reasonably be ta^en to the stipula-tione in the Covenant on this point on the ground that theCouncil is a body of a too definitely political character,and that the Assembly is too large to assume satisfactorilyIn the first instance the duties of a Board of Conciliation.     In the opinion of the Swedish Government, a Commission,of which the composition is left to the choice of the parties concerned and whose members would therefore onjoy their full confidence, would bo better qualified to apply from the outseta procedure ef conciliation which, in accordance with theprovisions of the Covenant, must apply in the case of alldisputes not settled by Judicial procedure.     Itr may be held that the investigation of the dispute;by representatives of either porty nominated beforehand,meeting under an impartial chairman, ani already familiar with the circumstances of the dispute or in a position toacquire the necessary information without difficulty, wouldm a rule lead to less friction between the Parties and
would more readily lead to a definite result than thoimmediate submission of the dispute to the Council or theAssembly.  Should this procedure not succeed the disputecould still bo submitted for consideration by the council or the Assembly.     Tho method suggested would at least have tho twofoldadvantage, that the dispute would bo submitted to tho Councilafter having already been made the subject of a thorough investigation, and that the investigation itself,- an important point - would have been carried out by men chosen mainly bythe interested Parties;     While the Swedish Government adheres absolutely and whole-heartedly in sll essentials to the Norwegian scheme, there  isone proposal from which it feels bound to dissociate itself.The Swedish Government does not consider it desirable to lay down rules, as the Norwegian proposals suggest, conferringnoon the Conciliation Commission the right to assume the role of Courts of Arbitration,   Heedless to say those parties whichdesire to do so will be entitled to have recourse to aCommission of Arbitration.  But, as a general rule,  an institution whose principal duty ifc is to act as mediatorbetween two parties would not appear to bo the best  suited to exercise the duties of judge, which, for their properexecution, require other qualifications.  If the habit ofresorting to Conciliation Commissions as if they were courts of Arbitration became general, there would bo a- danger ofconfusion of work:, which,  though similar, should be  . eptseparate and performed in accordance with distinctiveprinciples.     Furthermore, if as laid down by the draft constitutionof a Permanent Court of International Justice drawn up by aninternational committee of jurists, the present PermanentCourt of Arbitration at The Hague is preserved and invested
with new and important duties, there would be still lessneoesaity for instituting arbitration procedure  along  thelines indicated in the proposals of the Norwegian Government.     The omission of all the provisions relating to the definition of the duties of Courts of Arbitration and  ofthose of the Conciliation Commissions would also considerablysimplify the terms of the Norwegian proposals.     The Swedish draft differs from the Norwegian proposals on certain points not dealt with here.   They, however, areof relatively minor importance, and it would appear not necessary to mention or discuss them here.
AlffiEX TO THE COVENANT Oi1 THE LEAGUE. OP 11ATI0N3.                .  goaoiiiATiou camssibra                        ARTICLE 1.     &apos; &apos;     Before the end of tho year           the Members  of theLeague of.Nations shall nominate two by two the Conciliation.Commissions provided for by Article XV Of the Covenant of theLeague.
