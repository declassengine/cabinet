Manyspeakers have evinced fear of arrest and have accordingly moderatedtheir speeches just far enough to render them, in their own judgement, immune from prosecution.     The attempts to work up feeling on the subject of Russia have met with very little success hitherto, although the propagandistsaffirm that trade with Russia will practically put an end to unemployment,     Moscow is now insisting that the various &quot;Young Communist&quot;movements must be merged into one body, controlled, naturally, byMoscow.  Extracts from a hitherto unpublished manifesto on thissubject are given.     Unemployment overshadows all other questions.  The temper ofthe unemployed is deteriorating, but the vast majority is stillquite sound.  The extensive plans now being considered by the glasgow Corporation have given great satisfaction to the workers.     The Annual Congress of the International Federation of trades union is now sitting in London,  Sixteen countries are represented,hut the Amerioan Federation of Labour has withdrawn, and Mr. Appletonhas resigned, owing to the Federations deviation from industrialto political questions.  Mr. J. R. Thomas has been elected president.     Mr. Malone, H.P. has been sentenced to six monthsr imprisonmentin the Second Division and has been bound over in his own reoognizances                                                         and/
and two sureties to be of good behaviour for 12 months.  He has given notice of appeal.     The horror of the events in Dublin last Sunday must not beallowed to obscure the real position of the terrorists, who aregrowing more end more unpopular throughout the country.  EvenSinn Poin itself.is shaken&quot;  The Galway County Council haswithdrawn its allegiance to Sinn Fein.  It is suggested that thetime has now come to consider the question of proclaiming an amnesty to all those v/ho come in and surrender their arms,provided they havo not been guilty of murder.  For this purposea list, of exceptions to the amnesty might now be prepared.  Itmight have the effect of still further detaching the terroristsfrom the people.
g.c.m.g.^UfllSH PI GREAT BRIgjAIg         Communism in this country appears,  temporarily,  to be   : making no progress, if indeed it has not lost ground.   Too    much comfort, however, should not bo drawn from this  fact,    which results from a number of accidental circumstances not    necessarily of a permanent nature - a surplus of labour,    the absence of any national industrial upheaval, the  effect   , on meetings of the odder weather,  the Armistice commemoration    and the arrests of revolutionaries.         On November 21st a group of disreputable characters,    among whom were Colonna and Bishop, held a communist meeting    in Trafalgar Square to protest against the imprisonment of    certain of their members.  Only about 500 people.listened    to the speakers arid when they left  the plinth,  a sailor, a    soldier and a civilian tore up the  red flag.         Not more than 300 people;, the  majority as  usual of    alien extraction, assembled in the  Liverpool  Stadium to hear    John S.  Clarke, editor of &quot;The Worker&quot; on Kov ember.  21st.    The stewards were heard lamenting the poor attendance and,  .  saying that nothing like the amount required  to pay for the  -  hall,  7.  7.  C,  would be raised.         Unfitting evidence of the failure of communism in    Coventry,  which has for weeks been  treated as a forcing ground    for the  British revolution, was contained in  a  letter from   .the-Executive Committee of the Communist Party  of Great Britain,    which stated  that &quot;the  recutive Committee did  not  consider the    Coventry branch was strong enough to  support  a  candidate&quot;&apos;&apos; ...  for Parliament.  On the same occasion a  letter  was  read in    which Dora Monteflore  asked, if any,members would adopt  children    of Austro-Hungarian communists  who were,in prison  for  political    offences.   She  stated  that these children  were  being smuggled    over as  the children of bona fide passengers.   Two  communists                                                     offered/
     Margery Newbold, who has recently been in Russia on behalfof the Young Labour League,  has been forced to confess that&quot;Discipline must be  obeyed and our instructions are that if we desire to link up with the continental movement we should try to have only one party for youth in England and so must get into touch with the other two to see what can be done for unity.&quot;  Theother two are presumably the Proletarian and the Socialist SundaySchools.     Interest attaches to the following manifesto, which isdeclared to be &quot;not for publication at present&apos;1&apos;:          &quot;To the young workers of England.          &quot;Young Comrades,               In tne last great struggle which broke loose          between Capital and Labour, between Imperialism and                                                    Communism/     offered to adopt a male  and a female  child  respectively  and  a     levy of 1/- per member is  to  be made  for  their  support.          Communist meetings  in Glasgow during the week-end are     reported to have been poorly  attended and to  have yielded     &quot;miserable collections&quot;.   McLean  and  McDougall  are  devoting     much attention to Blantyre where  they are always warmly  welcomed     by about 500 young hooligans  who  style themselves the  T&apos;Red Guard     On November 20th McLean  told  them to  prepare  themselves  for     bloodshed by military discipline.          Sylvia Pankhurst is reported to  have received   1,500 from     Russian sources within the last few days; this  is no doubt part     of the  3,000 promised by  Lenin and some   750 has accordingly     been handed over to Norah  Smythe, who has now returned to the     office after an attack of  diptheria,  while Burgess  has received      250 for expenses connected with  the  &quot;Workers&apos;  Dreadnought&quot;.          The Scottish communists  who  have returned  from Russia are     said to be in a state of unusual  affluence.&quot;THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL Ojj- YOUTH&quot;
Communism, the young workers are specially interested.  Millions of young proletarians sufferunder the yoke of imperialist military dictatorship.Economically they are exploited to the greatestextent; they are shut cut from the High School and educational appointments, and they were the first to he dragged to the battlefield to sacrifice theirlife and blood in the interests of and for the profit of the imperialist rulers.     &quot;.... To-day well over half a million of young workers are organised in the International of communist Youth.  Young workers of England, withspecial joy have the young comrades received the news that Proletarian Sunday Schools and organisations of the young have been formed in England .....&quot;     &quot;Long live the Communist Youth of England.     &quot;Long live tho Communist International of Youth.                   ?he Executive Committee of the                  Communist International of Youth.&quot;BERLIN. .September 1920COUNCILS Of ACTION     The attempts made to stir the Councils of Action intoactivity have met with little success; reports indicate very general apathy.  There is no doubt that in August many of themoderates wore stampeded into supporting the councils throughfear of losing their positions, but now that the extremistsare unable to conjure up the bogey of conscription, the movement is, in. the national sense, moribund.  There is little doubtthat if a general strike were called to enforce peace withRussia, the outcome would be a .fiasco.     There is further confirmation that the Russian trade delegation is concerned above all else with British Labour.Some six or seven young men, who came over with Kameneff as&quot;experts&quot;, are occupied solely with investigating labour conditions and associating with the workers.   They have noqualifications as experts and have access at any time to                                                Krassin&apos;s/S- 3 -
     Krassin&apos;s room which they enter without ceremony.  Hishkc     who is a professed Bolshevik, did not conceal his pleasure \-:     at the coal strike or any other industrial unrest.     Professor Volkoff, on the other hand, is not a Bolshevik,  1     and nas been used merely as a screen.                     I          Unemployment still remains the one important questionll     The. temper of the men is becoming more bitter.  Timpty     I     premises have been seized at Islington, Camberwell and    j     Deptford, apparently by ex-Servicemen,  Although the vast     majority of the unemployed appears anxious to adopt     constitutional means there is a growing body which says,     &quot;We shall never get work until we force the Government to     provide it.&quot;  It is pointed out that until there is a     satisfactory scheme it Is useless to labour the question     of output, for the men think that by working harder they  t     are contributing to unemployment themselves.          There is considerable alarm among working men as to     what the position will be in January and February.        I         ,. Communist agitators have transferred their attention  I     temporarily from Coventry to Birmingham, where they are try!     to arrange marches to the various factories- they have,     however, a comparatively small following- in Birmingham.          Very extensive plans for providing work are being                                                                i     reviewed by the Glasgow Corporation Special Committee on     Unemployment and the workers have expressed much satisfactiiTHE 0OALV?iiIIHEB$  &apos;          Although the great majority of miners appear to be     working steadily, a good deal of extremist propaganda is                                                       in/
     in progress; the storm oentres, as usual, are South Wales     and Scotland.  A. J. Cook and Noah Ablett are endeavouring     to &quot;ginger up&quot; their federation and the former is leading a     movement for the abolition of tho clause which makes a two-     thirds majority essential before a strike can be called.  *          In Scotland, McLean and McDougall&apos;s activities     threaten results; on November 20th the conference of &quot;rebels&quot;     at Blantyre decided on the establishment of &quot;one Union for     Scotland&quot;, the &quot;immediate operation of the five days&apos;  week&quot;   -  and the &quot;effective control by the rank and file of their     officials&quot;.  There is said to be some support for this     programme among the younger miners in Lanarkshire and Fife-     shire but there will probably be considerable opposition  from     the steadier elements.          In Nottinghamshire and Leicester the.extremists are     also trying to discredit the local union officials.THE CO-OPERATIVE HOVSIVJEKT          Determined efforts are being made by the Co-operative     Wholesale  Society Financial.Propaganda Department to-secure     the transference of the workers1  savings from the Post Office     to the Co-operative Banks.  With this object in view a     campaign is in progress in various parts of the country,  one     of the most important, meetings taking place at the Memorial                      ?    .......,.......     Hall on November 20thc  Six hundred delegates were present     and i&apos;.Ir. Burt Williams gave particulars of co-operative     investments.          In 1919 the increase in the share capital of the movement     is reported to have been  12,346,341, an advance of nearly     seven millions on the previous  year.   On January 1st,  1920,     the membership of the retail co-operatives was 4,131,477.
          My South Wales correspondent states that  there is     a strong local movement for the establishment  of a     &quot;Co-operative College&quot;, on tho lines of  the Labour  and     Euskin Colleges,  where &quot;co-operative propaganda and economics     will be taught.&quot; THE mPSPElTOjSBg LABOUR PARTY          The suggested now programme of the  Independent Labour     Party, to which reference was made in my report No. 80,  has     rekindled all the old feuds between Left and Right  groups     within the party.  The various squabbles disclose little more     than an astonishing lack of unity, and the, final dissolution     of the party is not impossible.  The Communist section  of the     Independent Labour Party met at Glasgow on November 22nd;     Wilson of Liverpool, Walton Newbold and R. C  Glass were     among those present.  My Yorkshire correspondent reports     that the local followers of Macdonald and Snowden have  been     terribly scared by Walton Newbold who told them to  get  ready     for civil war instead of preaohing that the millennium can     be brought about by prayer and resolutions.THE UNION OP DEMOCRATIC CONTROL          This organisation, whioh is not in a flourishing     condition, was greatly perturbed at the beginning of this     month by an intimation from Philips Price that he proposed     to stop his usual subscription of  1,000, possibly as a     result of increased domestic expenses.  Charles Trevelyn     wrote immediately asking &quot;Do you think you could let us down     easy for this year with  500?&quot;  Price has now apparently     promised &quot;continued support.&quot;0. L, MAhONE. M.P.          Qn November 3.9th ex-Colonel Malone, M.P.  was sentenced     to six months1 imprisonment in the Second Division, was bound                                                         over/
      over for twelve months to bo of good behaviour and keep the &apos;      peace in the sum of  2,000 himself and ordered to find two      sureties of  1,000 each.  Notioe of appeal was given and      Commander Grenfell and Miss Anne Withers were accepted as      sureties.  The conviction has left the Communists singularly      unmoved.CONVICTIONS AND PROSECUTIONS           miring the week extremist speakers named Edward Stoneham,      Robert Jones and George Turner, have been convicted of making      speeches likely to cause disorder and have been bound over in      various sums to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.           In a letter dated November 20th Jones stated that he      would have &quot;to lie low for two or three weeks&quot; owing to his      wife1s indisposition but indicated that after that period he      would resume  his activities.           John Steele, who is believed to have fomented the      VThitehall disturbance, and R. V.  Harvey were arrested yesterday      for making seditious speeches at Birmingham and will appear on      Friday.TRS &quot;DAILY RSRALD&quot;           Secure in the possession of Russian funds, the &quot;Daily      Herald&quot;  is making a great show with &quot;Our Great Circulation      Push&quot;.   It is  offering prize  money to the amount of  2,500      to readers who are,  or to local labour parties who number      among their members,  the most successful &quot;circulation agents.&quot;      It may,  however,  occur to some readers that 2d. is a      comparatively  high price to pay for a paper of eight small     , pages, more than  one  of which is  devoted,  not infrequently,                                                        to/
     to self-advertisement.          There seems little doubt that the paper is proceeding     to carry out plans for the Northern edition, although the     anticipated financial support from Trade Unions has not     yet materialised.          My Birmingham correspondent sends the following figures     relating to &quot;Daily Herald&quot; sales:              Copies received daily by agent before               increase in price ......................  5670              Copies received daily by agent since               increase in price ......................  5400              Average daily number of unsold copies ...  1080          It is stated that Booth,  who was connected with the     Wheeldon case, is bringing an action against the &quot;Daily     Rerald&quot; in regard to an article in which he was described as     an aasnt provocateur.SB3 gjIN IN GKaAT BRITAIN          The usual meetings of the Irish Self-Determination Leagu     have been held in the London area, those at Tooting and Claph     being the best attended.  Events in Ireland have caused     considerable excitement in Sinn Pein circles and efforts are     being brought to beer on British Labour, particularly on the     National Union of Railwaymen,  with a view to influencing the     Irish policy of the Government.          On November 17th the Labour Party, issued a manifesto     declaring that &quot;the British Cabinet has forfeited whatever     rights it may have had to govern Ireland&quot; and that  &quot;there is     nothing for it now but to               1.   Withdraw the armed forces.               2.   Place the responsibility for order on the                       local authorities.
         3.  Provide for the immediate election cf a              Constituent Assembly to work out, without              limitations or fetters, a Constitution for              Ir &amp;l3rilCl 9The manifesto further declares that &quot;the Labour Party hasdecided to conduct a great national campaign to enlightenthe public on the facts of the first situation and topresent the Labour policy&quot; and invites financial support for this project.     The &quot;Labour Commission on Reprisals in Ireland&quot; hasdecided, in view of the events during the week-end, to postpone its tour of investigation.     On November 21st Dr. MannI? addressed a meeting ofabout 5,000 people at Boltcn.  The following are the moreimportant passages in a very long and bitter speech:          &quot;I did tell them in America and I repeat it here,     that there is no part of the world, Bulgaria, America,     anywhere you like, that was over guilty of such     frightfulness, than that which is done under the shadow     of the British flas in Ireland. ... You cannot speak     the truth about Iraland, anywhere, without at the same     time rousing up in tho breasts of honest men, anti-     British feeling ...          &quot;If I have not been able to meet Irishmen in     Ireland, I have been able to meet them in London,     Portsmouth, Leods, Bradford and Bolton, and before I     have done I will meet them in every part of the Empire.     They have banned me in England from Liverpool, Manchester     and Glasgow ...          &quot;I am proud to suffer for Ireland and secondly I say,     what right have I to talk about suffering fur Ireland?     When I think of the Lord Mayor of Cork and, when I think     of the poor boy Barry,  they have buried hm in a felon1 s     grave, but Ireland has taken him to her heart ...          &quot;They have made themselves ridiculous in the     eyes of the whole world by detaining me and whatever     I can do against them in Ireland, I can do ten times     as much against them here.          &quot;I do not want to say any hard things against the     Government.  I do not want to say any hard things about     the British people,  but I would ask the British people,     do they realise what is going on in their name almost     within a stone rs throw or the I ing&apos;s Palace and the House     of Commons?  If they realised they would believe as I     believe that this  is no personal matter.   It is a question     of humanity.   It is  not a question of any political party     but it is  a question whether or not  the British people     are to be  held up  aiiti rightly held up before the whole     world  as the  greatest? hypocrites that the world has ever     seen ...                                                 &quot;The/
          &quot;The presence of the Army of Occupation in     Ireland is the cause of all the trouble.  Take away     that Army of Occupation, leave the Sinn Fein men a    $     free hand.  They would make good use of their     opportunities and they would never have to send for     the Black and Tans to keep order.  The Government Bay,     fWe must first of all crush this murder gang.&apos;  There     is no murder gang in Ireland that I know of.  I know     nothing of this murder gang, but if there were a     murder gang there, the only people who could     legitimately put ihem down and keep them in order would     be the Republican Sinn Fein Parliament..          &quot;Are the labour Party going to take any action     with regard to Ireland?  Are they going to stand by     these principles, and if not, why not?  You are     sending men and munitions to Ireland.  Not trained     troops, not disciplined, but untrained troops, black     and tans, men who shoot women with babies in their     arms.  Are you, are the Labour Party going to stand     that?  Are they going to allow these men and munitions     to go over without a protest, as they protested in     the case of Russia?          &quot;You are better friends of England than those     who are bringing England&apos;s name into the gutter.     Tell everybody that you are trying to wipe out     england shame.  It is a hard thing to say hut     Ireland will forgive even the black and tans, even     the blood that has been spilt at the hands of the     black and tans, Ireland&apos;s friendship is to be won     and you are the people to win it.&quot;     A resolution was passed by &quot;this monster meeting of lancashire citizens&quot; demanding the removal of the ban onDr. Mannix.     The Irish Self-Determination League announces that a&quot;great national convention&quot; will be held at Manchester onNovember 27th to which only accredited delegates will beadmitted.  This will bo followed by a &quot;Gigantic demonstrate next day, at which Arthur Griffith, Eoin MacNeill, Kevin0&apos;Sfalel, Sean Miltoy, Art 0&apos;Brien and George Clancy areexpected to speak.     On November 21st about 11,000 Sinn Feiners headed byseven bands and Sinn Fein flags marched to St. James&apos; ChurchBootle, when a requiem Maes was held for the ManchesterMartyrs.   After the service they marbhed in military orderto Ford cemetery; many of the demonstrators were dressed inthe/
    the costume of the Irish National Foresters.     Hanna is still active in South Wales, but althoughvarious meetings have been held, the efforts to stop theexport of steel and coal to Belfast have hitherto provedunsuccessful.  Sinn Feiners in the 1&apos;erthyr and Dowlaisdistricts are much perturbed because the parish priest,Dr. ffalsh, placed a ban on a procession organised in memoryof MoSwiney.  He decreed that &quot;the Church could not participate in movements of a political nature.&quot;     Glasgow Sinn Feiners appear to be marking time;OfSheehan is dangerously ill and the man expected to take his place has not arrived from Ireland.IRELAND     Although the week ending November 20th was somewhatquieter, a shocking outbreak of murders occurred in Dublinduring  the week-end.  These murders of military officers were apparently committed on an organised plan by persons from the provinces who came to Dublin on the pretence ofattending a Gaelic Football match in Croke Park, Dublin.The 183 outrages reported show a decrease of 17 on theprevious week; of these 97 were wholly attributable to SinnFein, 8 were agrarian in origin, and 76 were serious crimesnot attributable to agrarian or political motives.  Duringthe week 5 police were killed.     There were no attacks on police barracks but onevacated barrack was destroyed by fire.  Twa military officersand four civilians were kidnapped.  The body of FatherGriffin, Catholic Curate, Galway, who was missing for somedays has been found with a &quot;bullet wound in the brain.Intimidation and robbery of mails continue in various partsof Ireland.                                      ,-ow/                                 O O Q                            m    Coo
                         ** IE *&quot;     &quot;Old Ireland&quot; considers the international position asbeing &quot;never brighter from an Irish point of view&quot; andpoints out the unprecedented opportunities that fie Irish&quot;diplomats&quot; in America have to influence Harding in favourof the Irish question.     The Labour situation remains critical.  The railway-question is left to the decision of the railwaymen themselvethis concession is a confession of weakness on the partof Labour.  The railwaymen did not start the trouble at theinstigation of their own Union but at the behest of the IriaiTransport Union in conjunction with Sinn Fain.  Now the railwaymen are practically thrown over by the Transport Uniotand Sinn Fein mainly on aocount of laok of funds and unless they receive the support of their own Union there is nothingleft for them but surrender.     The &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; has an article headed &quot;Ifthe rail men hold fast&quot; which almost implores the railwaymanto hold out hut foresees their surrender thus &quot;If the railwe;men fail the fighting out and winning of that issue may be postponed for a time and the issue? It is the Social issue -if the railwaymen can hold fast we hive faith and hopeenough in the Irish people to believe they can hold out tovictory.&quot;     It is the considered opinion of many capable of judgingthat the railway question is one of the kays to the presentsituation.
