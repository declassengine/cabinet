This system is for practical purposes precluded by  the  Factory and       Workshop Act, 1901, which  provides for a fixed daily period of  employment with-       in  the limits of 6 a.m. to 6 p,m. or 7 aem. to 7 p.m.,  or,  in the case of non-       textile workers, 8 a em. to 8 pBm8, and requires that the  hours  of work and       intervals for meals shall  be the  same for all women and young persons employed.            During the War these provisions were modified by Emergency Orders and       women were employed on systems  of alternating day and night shifts or on a       system of three 8 hour shifts,  or when night work was not necessary on a       system of two day shifts.            When the Armistice came the Home Office decided,  with the concurrence       of  tho Ministry of Labour, that it would be justified,at  any  rate during       the transition period between war and peace conditions, in allowing the       continuation of a system of two day shifts in suitable  cases.   This view was       supported by a recommendation of  a strong and representative  Committee       appointed by the kinistry  of Reconstruction, to advise  on the employment of       women after the War - the  arguments for the two shift system  being  (a)       that it would help to absorb surplus trained woman labour;  (b)  that it would       increase production with a reduotion of overhead charges; and (c) that it would       afford a passage to the shortening of hours (see page 4 of the  Report attached).            The powers under which the  two shift system has been allowed will -       in  the absence of legislation - come to an end on the termination of the War,       and having regard to the recommendations of the Reconstruction Committee and to       the information given   me by the Factory  Inspectors  and  from other sources       as  to the difficulties that would be caused by the abolition  of the system, it       was decided to take the earliest  opportunity of introducing legislation,,  It       was neoessary to^ntroduce legislation for carrying out the 7/ashington       Conventions as to/,employment of ohildren and as to night  work by women and       young persons, and it was  thought convenient to combine with&apos;legislation on this       subject a provision on the two  shift system.  Accordingly,  in the Women,       Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill a clause was inserted providing       that - &quot;Notwithstanding anything  contained in the Faotory and Workshop Act, 1901,       &quot;it shall, subjeot to any  conditions prescribed by the  Secretary of State, be       &quot;lawful at any time between 6 in  the morning and 10 in the  evening, on any       &quot;weekday other than Saturday, to  employ women and young persons in shifts       &quot;averaging for each shift  not more than eight hours per day&quot;.            This proposal met with opposition from the Labour Party and from others,       and a motion to delete the clause was carried against the Government in  &apos;       f!ommittee9
       I then appointed a Committee to consider the whole question before theReport stage of the Bill was taken.  This Committee has examined the evidence submitted by both  opponents and supporters of the proposal, and has come toa unanimous oonolusion that there should be a power in the horne Offioe to make orders allowing the employment of women and young persons on a two shift systembetween 6 a*nu and 10 p.m., subject to such conditions as the Home Offioe mayoonsider neoessary to safeguard the welfare and interests of the workers.  TheCommittee recommend that suoh Orders should only be made for individual factoriesor for a olass or group of factories, that this power should not extend to young persons under 16 years of age. and that it should be granted, in the firstinstance, for a limited period of five years, with a view to a further inquirytowards the end of that period and a reoonsideration of the question in thelight of experience.      These modifications of the original proposal will no doubt remove someof the opposition, and, in any case, the reasons for legislating on the lines recommended by the Committee are strong.  If such a provision is not introduced,a number of women will, at the termination of the War, be automatically thrown out of employment.  The two shift system has great&apos; eoonomio advantages, in thatit enables employers in many trades to secure increased production without inoreasof buildings and machinery.   The shift system is the best method of shorteningworking hours,.      As opinion in the     Houso is sharply divided, and as either course willbe strongly opposed, I ask a decision of my oolleagues whether or not I shouldtake steps to carry out the recommendations of the Committee on Report stage*                                                               E.

Employment   of  Women  and  Young  Persons               on  the  Two  Shift   System,REPORT OF  COMMITTEE.To the Right Hon.  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT.  Sir,      1.  We have  the honour  to submit  the following Report  dealing with the matterreferred to us in the Warrant of Appointment issued on 18th August, 1920.    We have met on 14 days and have examined 129 witnesses.    The witnesses have included the following:         Representatives of Organised Labour.        Representatives selected by  women who are  actually  employed on the two-shift            system in various works.        Representatives of Employers&apos;  Organisations and of individual firms.        Representatives of three Joint Industrial Councils.        Medical Witnesses and Social Workers.        Representatives of the Factory Department of the Home Office,  of the Board of            Education and of the Ministry of Labour.    2. It will be convenient  to state briefly the circumstances in which the two-day shift system as affecting women and young persons was introduced.    Previous to the war the employment of women on the shift system was precluded for all practical purposes by the provisions of the Factory and  Workshop Act, 1901, which (subjectto certain  exceptions)  require  that (1)  in each factory or workshop employing women and young persons there shall be fixed a daily period of employment within the limits 6 a.m. to6 p.m., 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., or in the case of non-textile works, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and (2) that thehours of work and intervals shall  be the same for  all women and young persons employed.    Moreover,  before the war no substantial need for the employment of women on shiftshad been experienced by the manufacturers.  Where exceptional pressure arose, they were able to meet it by enlargement of premises  or plant, or, if the pressure was of a temporarynature, by the prolongation of the ordinary working hours either within the ordinary maximumlimits prescribed by the Act or, in the case  of seasonal trades, by  making use of the  specialovertime authorised by the Act.    During the war, however, the imperative need for the maximum production of munitions and  other supplies  necessitated the widespread  adoption  of  the employment  of women and  young  persons   on  the, shift  system,  and sanction  for their employment  wasgiven by  Orders  issued  by  the Home Office  under Section 150 of the  Factory  andWorkshop  Act,  1901, as  extended by  Defence  of the  Realm  Regulation  No.  6A.In  the  early part  of the war  the  system chiefly  adopted  was that  of two,alternatingday and night  shifts, but later on, as it became  more and more recognised that the workers on these long shifts were unable to retain their efficiency and  as the  difficulties of the  supply oflabour, particularly skilled labour, were gradually overcome,  the  two day and night shiftswere  replaced to a  considerable extent by a system of  three 8-hour shifts,  and when nightwork was  not necessary, by a  system of  two-day shifts.    With  the Armistice, the situation at once changed.   The need for production of munitionsrapidly dwindled, and large numbers of women had in consequence to be discharged  from the munition factories.   At the same time the demobilisation of the forces commenced,  and  with it the replacement of male for female labour.  As  a result of these two factors, the prospectof unemployment for  women became very serious, especially  in  districts  where in  normal circumstances the openings for female labour are strictly  limited. On the other hand, an extensive  demand arose on all sides for articles  required for purposes of reconstruction andfor commodities, the  production of which  had  been  restricted for war purposes,  with theresult that in various industries which had been  in a state of  suspended animation  duringthe war, the manufacturers began to be overwhelmed with  orders.  To meet these  demandsthe pre-war  methods were no longer available.  A shortage of skilled male labour (aggravated by the shortage of housing accommodation which  diminished the  mobility  of  labour), andshortage of material, put any rapid extension of premises and plant out of the question, while    (30888-40)  Wt. 23623-G 183 1,600 11/20 H, St, G. 35,                                         A s
the general movement which set in strongly throughout the country in favour of shorter work-ing hours not only prevented recourse to overtime, but rendered it desirable, if not essential,to reorganise work on the basis of the 48-hour week.   In these circumstances the thoughts of manufacturers  were naturally  directed to the possibility  of  turning  to  a count for peace-purposes a system of employment which had proved so successful in meeting the pressure ofwar, and numerous applications began to be received at the Home Office for leave to employor to continue to employ women on shifts for purposes of peace production.  So far as theseapplications involved  night work the Home Office was not disposed  for obvious reasons to entertain them, but the prospect of serious unemployment among women, and  the necessityin the national interest of increasing production, both to meet home needs and  also to re-establish our export trade, and of facilitating the change over from the 12 hour to the 8 hourday made out a strong case for permitting the employment of women in shifts, and the HomeOffice decided,  with the concurrence of the Ministry  of Labour that it  would be justified,at any rate during the transition period, in allowing  the employment of women  and youngpersons on a system of two day-shifts in suitable cases.    A similar view was taken by the strong and representative Committee  appointed by  theMinister of Reconstruction to advise  in the light of experience gained during the war, on  the opportunities for the employment of  women and the conditions of such employment after thewar.  This Committee deal on page 29 of their Report (Cd. 9239) with the question of  theconditions of the two-shift system as follows :            &apos;&apos; With the cessation of the war and the gradual restoration of peace conditions, the      present  Emergency Orders of  the  Secretary  of  State authorising the employment      of women on the shift system will in the ordinary course come to an end.   The question      of continuing the power of allowing employment on this system, so far as day work is      concerned, is one  that will require  consideration not  only  in.respect  of the transition      period, but afterwards.   It is  a matter of common knowledge that many employers in      different districts and trades (of whom.Lord Leverhulme is probably the best known)      are anxious to obtain sanction for a continuance of this system.  The argument for its      continuance where required  during the transition period of demobilization  and re-      settlement, and so long as essential industries are. hampered in production by a shortage      of male  labour,  is strong.  The further question is, however, raised  whether it would      not be in the National interests, as well  as in that of many women workers, if a system      of two short shifts (to  be worked between certain fixed hours) could be  sanctioned, in      suitable cases, for  normal times.  We are of opinion  that this proposal should  be care-      fully considered  for the following reasons :              (1) A  system of two short day  shifts would help to  absorb considerable                   quantities of surplus trained women labour,  and so ease the pressure on                   the labour market and diminish the danger of widespread unemployment.                   This argument  applies with special force  to  areas where,  although  con-                   siderable  numbers of  women have been engaged in  munitions or other                   war manufacture during the past three  or four years, there is normally                   very  little industrial employment for women.             (2) It would sensibly increase production, with a reduction of overhead charges                    a matter  of special importance in the case of essential  products  and the                   export trades.             (3)  It would afford a passage to the shortening of hours.&quot;    3.  In May last,  191  Orders were in  force affecting  15,094 women  and 3,376 youngpersons.   We realise that the present limited extent to which advantage has been taken of theopportunity for adopting the system cannot be regarded as an indication of its possible extentif legislative sanction were obtained for it.   Evidence has been  brought before us to show  that employers have refrained from taking the necessary steps to put the system into operation,in view of the  uncertainty as  to a continuance of permission  to use it.   At the same time,from the evidence before us,  we have, not formed the impression that there is any  general desire on  the part of employers to make extensive use of the system.    There has been no suggestion  that it would be adopted in the great textile industries or in some other of  thestaple industries of the Country.  One fact is  certain that it can only  be worked to  theadvantage of the employer by the goodwill of the workpeople.    4.  The most important  part of the  evidence given before  us has  been  based on  theexperience gained during the two years in which these Orders have been in force.   In  con-sequence of the comparatively small number of Orders that have been issued, and the short period during which they have been  in force, the experience has been limited.   The orders are spread over  a large variety of trades, and it has only been possible in a  few cases to obtainevidence from the trade as a  whole.   &quot;We  have heard evidence  from the  Joint industrial councils of the glass, a section of the rubber trades and from the Employers&apos; Associations inthe Plate and  Sheet Metal,  Lace,  Cycle and  Motor Cycle, Soap and  Candle, Electric.Engineering, Rubber and Glass industries.  With these exceptions the  evidence before us with reference to the circumstances in.which the Orders have been or are likely to be adopted,has been given  by the representatives of individual firms,
m95       The evidence  indicates that  the  cases in  which  Orders have been obtained may  be   classified under four heads, though in some cases the reasons for the  introduction of  the   system overlap.       5.  Continuous Processes. In some industries in which the process is continuous, women   were engaged during the war to do work which had formerly  been done by men  and boys.&apos;   Their work was necessarily carried on in shifts.   In certain cases, it has been found impossible   wholly to replace  women upon whose work  other parts of  the process  depend.   The most   notable instance of this is probably the glass trade, in which women  were  substituted for male   young persons in  the process of taking in at the lehrs in the  glasshouses.  We have heard   evidence from both the employers&apos;  and workpeople&apos;s sides of the Joint Industrial Council  for   the trade to the effect that  it is impossible  to obtain  men for this work, and that  if women   and male young persons could not be employed in shifts, a large number of skilled men would   be thrown out of employment (q. 439,  441, 461-463).       In the tin plate industry and in the oil and seed  cake industry  men are employed in the   main processes on a system of three eight hour shifts; whereas women are employed in the   subsidiary processes on the  two-day shift system.  It has been represented to us that a single   eight hour day shift is not sufficient to deal with the accumulation of material that results from   the twenty-four hours&apos; work of the men,  and that unless women can be employed on the two   day shifts, they cannot be employed at all on the work.   The  continuous nature of the pro-   cesses in all these cases is essential to the industry.       6.   Seasonal  Trades. In certain trades the raw material is of a perishable  nature or the   demand is subject to seasonal irregularity.  It has been the  custom in such cases to engage   extra  labour during the busy season  and to work very heavy overtime as occasion might   require. Thus, in the jam making industry, it is lawful for women and young persons to work   very long hours during  the summer months  of the year.  In various trades to which the over-   time exceptions allowed under Section  49 of the Factory Act  apply,  women may be employed,   for a period of 14 hours, including two hours for meals.  Such long hours are now generally   admitted to be undesirable,  and in the event of further legislation on the subject of hours of   employment it will probably become impossible to adopt these expedients for coping with the   seasonal pressure.   This may be illustrated by reference to the flax industry.   The  Flax   Cultivation Company, Limited,  has taken over  the work which was previously done by the   Ministry of Agriculture and now employs about a thousand women in various processes which   are particularly suitable for women in connection with the de-seeding and scutching of flax.   The de-seeding has to be done between the months of September, when the crop is gathered,   and March, when the  seed  is sown.    It was  reported to us that during this period it is   necessary to have a second shift of women in order to cope with the work.   The flax stations   are situated in rural areas and the women who work on the extra  shift in the  winter are in   many cases employed in agriculture during the summer months (q.  1422-1476).  In this and   other cases of a seasonal trade, a system of shift employment is said to be the most satisfactory   method of dealing with  sudden increases in the volume of work  which cannot be postponed.       With  reference to  the question of overtime, we think it desirable to note the  opinion of   the Health of Munition Workers Committee :              Where  shifts  can be arranged  they  are  to be  preferred  to overtime, not only         because they involve less strain on foremen and workers, but because they enable  the         machines to be used for the whole twenty-four hours, and, in  addition, produce a better         and more   uniform  rate of output. (Health of  Munition Workers Committee.         Memorandum No. 5,  paragraph  10.)       7.   Temporary Shortage of Premises and Plant. A number of cases have  been brought   before us in which the  shift system  has been  adopted as an  emergency measure during a   temporary shortage of  premises  or plant in one or more departments of the  works.  Such   conditions have been accentuated by the difficulty experienced in  building premises and in   obtaining machinery both during and since the war, and we have had a considerable body of   evidence that there is still and is  likely  for some time to  come to be  a  shortage of plant,   premises and capital.   Instances of this  have been found in the cotton covered wire industry   (q. 962-982), tea packing (q. 1158-1160), rubber (q. 2055, 2074-2075), flannel weaving (q. 2973,   etc.), hosiery (q.  3305-3307),&apos;and other industries. At the end of the war these trades were   faced with a demand for a very  much  larger output  than  could possibly  be  produced in a   48-hour week.   With the aid of a double shift, the necessary output was or is being obtained.   though the firms have no intention of adopting the shifts as a permanent part of their industrial   system, and merely regard it as a temporary method  of increasing output until they are in a   position to extend their premises.  In  many cases coming in this  group  shifts have  been   adopted in one department only in which there was a shortage of machinery, and in this way   it has been possible to  preserve  the balance of the departments.       Difficulties of this kind are  liable to arise from time to time in the course of industrial   development, and  it has been represented to us  that it would be of great  advantage if it were,  permissible to use the two-shift system temporarily for such  purposes as  taking advantage of   a trade opportunity upon the securing of which  new markets may  depend.   The difficulty      30688                                                                         A ,
of preserving the balance of departments is a permanent one in some processes and industries,and the use of the double shift (of men) for the purpose of coping with it existed before the war.    8.  Reasons of a general character.-We have heard evidence from employers who desireto adopt  the two-shift method as a regular part of their industrial system in order to secureincreased output and a greater turnover in proportion to the capital engaged.  Before the warthe shift system had been  adopted in certain instances in connection with men&apos;s employment for these reasons,  but the general shortening of hours of employment combined with  thogreatly increased, cost of raw material and plant has added to the  difficulty of obtaining  anadequate return on capital expenditure.   Mr. Stuart Russell gave the following evidence  onbehalf of the  Federation  of British Industries  and  the India  Eubber Manufacturers,Association:            &quot; In the rubber trade the plant is expensive, the stocks that we  have to carry  are       very  large,  and although rubber  itself  is not one of the  articles that has gone up in       price yet, cotton, which we use  very largely in our manufacture, has gone up enor-       mously.  The result of that is that the turnover in our rubber factory is very little more       than equal to the capital engaged.  We do not turn over our capital much more than       once in a year.  That is a very low percentage of performance, and in order to turn it       over  more than that we must increase the output per machine or per  1,000 of capital       employed.  The only way I can see of meeting that condition is that we should work       longer  hours.   We  do  not want  to  work  the individual  worker   for  longer       hours,  but  we want to  get  the  longer  hours  by working in  shifts.           &quot; Is that  position the. result  of the reduction  in the number of hours since  the       war, or why is it necessary?   It has been -made worse  by that from  the nature of  the       trade.  From  the  heavy capital expenditure on buildings and plant, and the large       amount of money which is locked up in necessary stock of raw material, it has always       been that way, that the turnover in proportion to the  capital engaged has been small       compared with what it is in a great many trades.            &quot; That existed before the war?  That existed before the war, but it has been made       very much  worse by the  shortening of the hours  which has come in since  the war,       because with our same plant if we are only working one shift we are  getting now 20 to       25 per  cent, less hours worked.&quot;   (q. 816-818.)     We have also had evidence  from Dr. E. L. Peck,  of Messrs.  Lever Brothers, Limited, with reference to their proposed scheme of two six-hour shifts (q. 1223, etc.), from represen- tatives of the  Asbestos Industry (q.  3164, 3165), the Aluminium Industry (q. 3108), and other trades in which it is desired to work on a two-shift  system in order to secure  the maximum use of machinery.     9.  Whatever the reasons  are  for  the  adoption  of the system we find substantial uniformity in  the method  of working it.  In the great majority of cases brought before us,  the shifts cover a period of eight hours with half an hour for meals.   Those employed on the morn- ing shift work from 6 a.in. to 2 p.m., with a breakfast time from 8.30 a.m.  to 9 a.m., or from 9 a.m. to 9.30 a.m., and those on the afternoon shift from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m.,  with a tea interval from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., or from 5.30 p.m. to 6 p.m.  The morning shift work from Monday to Saturday inclusiva, and the afternoon shift from Monday to Friday inclusive.   This involves an average weekly total of 41^ hours or thereabouts.   In one or two cases the period has, owing to difficulties  of transport been put an hour later, i.e., from 7 a.m.  to 3 p.m., and 3 p.m. to 11 p.m.  We have had evidence of  instances of  shorter hours.  In one case the shifts were from 6 a.m. to 1  p.m., and from 1  p.m. to 9 p.m.  The proposed  scheme of  Messrs. Lever Bros., Ltd., involves an even shorter period.  Under this  scheme the morning shift will work from  Monday to Saturday from 7  a.m. to 1.15  p.m.,  with  a  meal time  from 8.45 a.m. to 9 a,m.  The  afternoon shift will work from Monday to Thursday from 1.15 p.m. to 9 p.m., with a meal time from 4.45 p.m. to 5.15 p.m., and Friday  1.15 p.m. to 8.45 p.m., with a meal time from 4.45 p.m.  to 5.15.   In some cases, the Orders issued by the Home Office required, in addition to the half-hour meal time a break of 10 or 15 minutes in the morning or afternoon. This requirement was made in cases in which without this break  there would have been an undesirably long spell of  work.      So  far as the evidence before us goes the adoption of the shift system has with one excep- tion  involved  a considerable shortening of hours, usually from 48 or 45  hours or 41  hours per week.   Although we have not considered that  our terms  of reference required us to consider whether or not the system is likely to be remunerative either to employers  or workpeople, we have thought it right to  enquire how the rate of pay has been affected by  the shorter hours. On enquiry we were informed that both piece work and time rates have been adjusted so as to prevent any reduction in  the average weekly wage of each individual.      10.  The objections to the two-shift system for women and young persons are well known  and  they have been stated before us  by many persons interested in women&apos;s work  and welfare.  These objections  may be summarised as relating to (a) the health and general welfare of the  worker; (b) the. comfort  of the family; and (c) the question of employment.  We have given  very careful consideration to all that has been urged before us because we recognise that no
method of working could be tolerated, however advantageous from an economic point of view,if it was prejudicial to the health or welfare of  the workers.  With a view to obtaining thefullest information on these matters we have called a great number and variety of witnesses.We have heard general evidence from representatives of  the  following organisations:-TheStanding Joint Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations, the National Federation ofWomen Workers and the Women&apos;s  Trade Union League, the Amalgamated Society of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers, the Scottish Council of Textile TradeUnions and the National Society of Pottery Workers.  The representatives of the two lastnamed organisations had had no practical experience of the system.  We have not confined our-selves to the evidence of the official representatives of the various Trade Union organisations.In the Glass and Rubber Industries, as already stated, witnesses have come  from the workers&apos;side of the Joint Industrial Councils.  Women employed  in these and other industries have described to us at first hand their own experiences.  We have satisfied ourselvesthat these last-mentioned witnesses were under no pressure or influence on  the  part of their employers togive evidence.  They were as a rule  selected by their fellow  workers to put before  us theirviews concerning the subject under our consideration, and we were satisfied from close enquirythat they were stating frankly and independently their real feelings and opinions.  In somecases they were accompanied by the local official of their Trade Union.    In addition to all the  above-mentioned  witnesses  we have heard Factory  Inspectors,Welfare  Workers and Medical Men  and Women with actual  experience of the shift system.    11.   Health and  Welfare of the  Worker-It was said that the weekly or fortnightlyalternation of shifts with consequent disturbance of the  hours for food and rest leads to sleep-&apos;lessness, digestive disorders  and a general deterioration.  The early and late hours,  oftenresulting in scamped meals are said to cause undue strain especially in oases where the workerlives  at a distance from the works.   We were told that  women who are on the morning shift1spend the whole or part of the afternoon when they  ought to be resting in  doing housework;:and similarly that  women on the afternoon shift work during  the morning with the resultthat  they are robbed of their proper recreation and  come tired to their work  and  also thatthere are moral dangers connected with  the  return home  of  women at  so late  an  hour.These as  well as the  other  objections  to which  detailed  reference  will be  made laterwere for the most part  voiced by  representatives  of  various  labour and women&apos;s organ-isations  above mentioned and also  by Miss  Phillips,  a  representative  of  the  YoungWomen&apos;s Christian Association.  Generally speaking,  we received no confirmation of thesefears either from the  workers  themselves or from  such  experienced and skilled observers as Factory  Inspectors and Doctors.   So far as the medical evidence is concerned, Dr. Legge,H.M. Medical Inspector of Factories, said  he  was surprised that digestive disturbance was not  found  to result, but  he  stated that there was no direct  evidence of any  such  effects (q.  3953).  Dr.  Legge also  drew our attention to the fact that the Health of Munition Workers Committee in the course of their investigation  obtained  no direct evidence that digestive disturbance was caused by the change of  habit involved in working on alternating shifts.   He was not prepared to recommend the prohibition of the system.    One medical practitioner&apos; in her evidence suggested that  the weekly change-over of shifts  would probably have a bad effect on  the health of the women working on the system (q.  3984-3991).  Apart from the opinion of this witness who had had no practical experience of the shift system, the medical evidence was not adverse to the two-shift system so far as the health  of the workers is concerned.  Attention was called by some of the  doctors to  the advantage of having good canteen accommodation on the works, and this and other arrangements to secure the comfort of the workers are obvious precautions which ought,  in our opinion, to be taken if the system is. allowed.      The evidence of the Factory Inspectors was, in the main, consistent with the medical evidence, and we especially refer to the statements of Miss Constance Smith, Senior Lady Inspector for  the North-Western Division.              Have you had any evidence  of the effects upon the health of the worker when       working on the two shifts?  No, I cannot say that  we have.  We have enquired and       we have  given  every opportunity for any evidence  to be offered, but we have never       had any.  We  have never received complaints of  any kind.   I  do  not mean only       formal or written complaints, but in talking  to women  we have never had  any com-       plaints that they have found themselves exhausted.&quot;  (q.  362.) and  Mr. Gerald Bellhouse, Deputy  Chief Inspector of  Factories             &quot; Are you able to speak as to the effect  of the shift  system upon the health of the       workers? I have consulted our medical advisers here, and so far as reports from our       district inspectors go, we have no evidence that  the system  has  had any  ill  effects       upon the workers at all, and the opinion of our medical advisers support that theory.;       they do not consider that the system is likely to be in  any way injurious.&quot;  (q.  46.) Miss Escreet, Senior Lady Inspector for the Midland  Division (q. 297), and Miss Sadler  for the  South-Western Division  (q. 5.97A) were the only  exceptions to an otherwise  favourable report, and their statements, as may be seen,  are somewhat inconclusive.      We have also had evidence from Welfare Supervisors which was of a very inconclusive character.   The views of the Welfare Workers&apos; Institute, an Association  with a membership    30688                                                                           A i
of about  4.50 men and women,  were put  before us by  Miss Yoysey and Miss  BevmgtoinTheir evidence was based on the results of a questionnaire which was issued to their members and to which less than 20 per cent, of the members replied.   So far  as health is concerned,22-3 per cent, of those replying who had had any experience of the two-shift system regarded it as beneficial or harmless,  and  19 7 per cent, regarded it as harmful (q. 3903).  We werenot able  to  investigate the evidence on which these opinions were based, nor had we any information  as to the experience  of those who expressed  the views.  These and other figuresput  forward hardly  seem  to  bear  out  the  general  condemnation  expressed  by  MissBevington (q.  3899).    The  opinions of the individual welfare  workers who gave  evidence  were favourable tothe two-shift system.    The  most direct and, so far  as it went,  the most conclusive evidence as  to the effects ofthe system on health came from workers. A number of petitions from women actually engaged on two day  shifts were placed before us in addition to the evidence given viva voce.  In one case an ex-worker at Messrs. The Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd., Miss Stubbs, who attended withMiss Symons, gave the following  answers :-           &quot; Your  experience is  that  as  soon  as you went  on  two  shifts your health       deteriorated? Not exactly.  The atmosphere certainly  has  a lot to do with  it at       Dunlop&apos;s.   We then worked day and  night;  we did  not  work eight  hours  close       together; there  were three  shifts.  The machines did  not get cold or  anything; they       simply went on and on, and there was no fresh air or anything allowed to come into       the shop.  Dunlop&apos;s is rather a warm place, and at night, if it was  a little bit cold       outside  and you had  the  window open, you would soon have somebody shouting for       the window to be shut or  something of that  sort.           &quot; Those works may  or may not be  badly ventilated; I  want to know  whether       your  evidence is that as soon  as you  went on the two-shift system your health began       to  deteriorate? Yes, they went together, and I  did not get  enough rest  if I wanted       to  go to an education class or anything.           &quot; That is another point.   You have given me two answers, and  I want to know       whether I understand you and you understand me.  Is your evidence  and your experi-       ence  this, that as soon as  you  and your intimate friends Avent on the two-shift system,       your  health suffered?-Yes.   (q. 4159-4161.)    A deputation of workpeople from the Dunlop Rubber  Co., Ltd., expressed an entirelycontrary  opinion, and  informed  us that the  Works Committee  desired a  continuation of thesystem (q. 2163-2164).    In no other case was any deterioration in health ascribed to the two day-shift system by women who had been employed on it.    12.   Effect on Education. An  objection concerning the general welfare of the women and  young persons employed on two shifts  was  that they are deprived of the advantages ofclub life  and classes.   It is  said, and no doubt with truth, that an alternating shift  preventsthe workers from giving the regular  attendance which  is essential.  This is undoubtedly a disadvantage inherent  in the two-shift system.  .    We  have considered the extent  to which the provisions of the  Education Act of 1918with  regard to compulsory  continuation classes  enter into  the  question.  On this  point  weliave  had the advantage of hearing  the evidence of  Mr. E.  K. Chambers  of the  Board ofEducation.  His evidence is printed in  full  (q.  3497-3542), but  in view  of our recommenda-tions with regard to young persons  under 16  year of age, it is unnecessary to  discuss this aspect further.  With regard  to women,  although we fully recognise the great value from every point of view of  clubs and  classes, the attendance  under the most favourable conditionseven  by  the younger women is admittedly very small in proportion to the number of women employed in industry.  In?some localities there  appear  to be no clubs,or classes, and on thewhole, the objection seems to us less weighty when the  habits and dispositions of the womenmost affected are considered.  To some extent, moreover,  the opportunities for recreationduring the afternoons and long week-ends in alternate  periods  may be regarded as  a set-off.     13.   Family Life.. Another  objection  which was  much pressed upon  us was the dis-turbance  which the two-shift  system  causes to family life.  It is said that the mother of the family, or housewife, is kept incessantly at work preparing  meals  at  all hours of the day and night, and  that  the  family  is  robbed  of the comfort  and happiness of a common table.Mrs.  Hood, of the  Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild, supplied  us in  this connection  with an interesting  account of the effects  of shift work  in mining  villages on  the life of the house-wife  (q.  1589); but the domestic conditions in a mining community in  which practically allthe men  and  boys over  14 years  of age are employed  on  a  system of  shifts can hardly be compared with those in, manufacturing communities where the number of persons employedon the two-shift system is and is likely to  be comparatively small.     At first sight, however, the  objection  appears  to be a serious one, but an examination ofthe witnesses who were  competent to inform us from actual  experience satisfied us that thedifficulties are  not  so great in practice, nor  so widespread as was suggested.
    We questioned these  witnesses with regard to the difficulties  winch the shiit system is said to cause in  domestic arrangements and found that in every case satisfactory arrange-ments could be and were  made without any serious addition  to the work of the household.These witnesses did not bear out  the  suggestion that the housewife  necessarily  or usuallygot up to provide breakfast before the 6 o&apos;clock start or remained up to provide supper at night.In some cases the  shift  workers are able to share the family mid-day meal, mothers though they arrive home  late for it, this  does not entail  the preparation of a special meal.   Wethink on the whole that this aspect of the question lias been exaggerated and that  in practicelittle  if any difficulty  is experienced  in making arrangements for meals.    14.  Effects of the  System on Employment.-Another objection put before us was thatthe system would  tend  to  make  employment more  spasmodic and  that employers  wouldrely on it  for dealing with  pressure of work  which is  not inevitable  and which should be avoided by improved  organisation.   Any  such  abuse  of the system by an employer  could, ifI he system of special orders is continued, be met by  withdrawing from him  the  permissionissued by the Home Office for the use of the system.     So far as  seasonal trades and continuous processes are concerned, we quote the followingextracts from Dr.  Marion Phillips&apos; evidence :-           &quot; Let me see  if-I have rightly  apprehended your evidence.   You object, lor the       very cogent reasons  you have given,  to  the  two-shift system altogether; you  think       it is objectionable even for men;  but  you would be  prepared to agree  for seasonal       trades  or for particular trades to a system under which  the Home Office might make       special and temporary orders.   Is that right ?-How are you reading &apos; seasonal trades &apos; ?           &quot;  Such a case as you  gave, the jam trade?  Trades where the  raw material is       seasonal? Yes.           &quot;  For  such trades as that you would have no objection to the Home Office having       power  to make an order each season as it comes round ? You mean to give  them  power       to work two shifts during that period instead of granting leave to work overtime?           &quot;  Yes? Yes.  I should think we would agree that that was a reasonable proposal,       if it was very strictly defined as relating only to trades in which the raw  materials       were seasonal and perishable.            &quot;Chairman:  That  is as  regards seasonal trades.  Would  you be  prepared to       consider an extension of the system under the same safeguards in the case of particular       trades where  continuous processes  were  necessary? Yes, on the case being proved,       putting the onus of proving &apos;t on the employer who applies.            &quot; That is to say, making the Home  Office the judge of whether he has discharged        the onus?-Yes.&quot;  (q. 1579-1582, 1587-1588.)      With regard to industries which are experiencing a temporary difficulty for the reasons already mentioned, Miss Symons, representing the  National Federation of  Women Workers and the Women&apos;s Trade Union League, gave the following  answers :-            &quot;Sir  Malcolm Delevingne : We have had certain cases put before us by  employers        in  which they say they want the two-shift system, at any rate for a time, while they        are carrying  out extensions  and getting the plant necessary in order to  enable them        to  meet their demands and that at present those extensions  cannot be carried out        and that plant cannot be obtained for causes with which we are all  familiar.   What        have you to say to that?            &quot;Miss Symons : I should say, if it is proved that there are many cases of that        kind,  the  way to deal with  them would be  to give the Home Secretary  very  limited        enabling powers for- a temporary period, but  not, as it  were,  for anyone  to use the        s\&apos;stem.              What  sort of  period would you contemplate ?   Do you see any&apos; prospect of        normal conditions being established in  the  next  two or three years?-1 should have        thought about twelve months, certainly.  Buildings  are now going  up pretty rapidly.        In any case  we feel that the enabling powers ought to be of a limited character and        ought only  to  provide for orders being issued in such cases as you have  mentioned         where there are peculiar building difficulties, not in any case in which it may be asked        for.     (q. 4200-4201.)       On the other hand, if the system is  prohibited, we think it is clear the result will be to   throw; a considerable number of women out of  employment.  In such places as St. Helens or   belby, where there is normally little demand for women&apos;s labour, it is unlikely that  the women   displaced would  be absorbed locally.  The  effect on  the employment of men  whose work-   depends on that  of the women, has also to be. borne in mind.  It is impossible to estimate the   total number of persons who would be thrown out of employment bv the  withdrawal of th*   permission to wore  the system.   In the  evidence given  by representatives  of  the British   Electrical and Allied  Manufacturers&apos; Association it was stated that if the permission for the   shift system were withdrawn in the cotton covered wire industry, to which reference has already   been made  the reduction in employment in the electrical  industry  alone would  amount to   Z\J,vOU people,  (q. 2od4.)
    In a  memorandum submitted  by the  Ministry -of Labour embodying  their conclusionsbased on  a wide knowledge of local industrial conditions, it is stated  that great difficulty would be  experienced in most  localities  in finding alternative employment  for workers whowould be  displaced by  the  termination  of the two-shift  system.   The  Ministry  of Labourfurther inform us that  the  supply of unskilled and semi-skilled workers has been in  excessof the demand since the Armistice, and that a.t the present moment  this position is  aggra-vated by the prevailing industrial depression.    15. Preferences of the Workers. We have  tried to ascertain,  as  far as possible, the opinions of the workers, not merely as to the effect upon  their health, but as to the reasons which incline them to prefer the single shift or the two-day shift system, as the case may be.Many expressed a preference for work on a single day shift, but  were afraid lest a  returnto a single shift might throw them  out of work.  Many others expressed a strong preference for the two-shifts.  The reasons for  these opinions vary  very much.   Some  like one thingand some another.  In one district  the early start is popular, in another it is not. Thelatter is generally the case where the worker  lives at a great distance from the factory.  Itwas pointed  out that in some  of the South Wales tin plate works the  workers live  a longway from  the works and the means of transport to the villages are  few.  This is a conditionof things which is open, in  our opinion,  to grave objection.  If the worker has a long walk,or train or tram journey, the hour  of beginning ought not in her interests to be as early assix o&apos;clock.  Where, on the other hand, the worker  lives close to her work, few felt anystrong  objection to the six  o&apos;clock  start.  With regard to the six  o&apos;clock start, it must  beremembered  that  until recently  this was  the custom  in  many  trades, particularly  in the textile trades in the North of England.   In certain cases in which an eight o&apos;clock start wastried, the  firms have reverted, at the request of the operatives, to a pre-breakfasfc start.    The question of housework entered to some extent into the discussion of the preference of the workers.    We find that  most of the  women do a certain amount of housework, particularly whenthey are working on the afternoon shift.   We have not found any case in which the amountdone  appears  to be  excessive,  and  the majority  of  the witnesses  seem  to  assume that they  would in any circumstances help to  some extent with the housework.  We did not find that they considered this obligation a grievance, though this depends  on individual  tastes.Thus Miss Martindale,  Senior Lady  Inspector for the South Eastern Division, in speakingof the diversity of opinion on the advantage of shifts, says  :           &quot; I asked one little girl if  she liked it, and she said she liked it very much indeed,      because  she was  able to  help her mother; the next  said she  objected to it very much      indeed, because her mother expected her to help her.&quot;  (q. 128.)    Taking the evidence as a whole, we can arrive at no  general statement of  the opinionsheld by  those women who are employed on the system.   We refer to some of the answerswe have received.    Miss Martindale replied as follows :            &quot; Have you tried to formulate, so far as possible, the views entertained  respec-      tively  by the workers and the employers  as to the working of the  system? Yes, I      have  tried to do that.           &quot; It is difficult, perhaps, to do it so far as the workers are concerned, because there      is a great variety of opinion? I find a great variety of opinion; some like it and some   . .  dislike it.        &apos;   &quot;Do you find there is that diversity of  opinion within the same works? Yes, and      even on the same machine.  I have found one girl  liking it and one condemning it.           &quot; Are you able to arrive at any useful  conclusion as to the views of the workers,      or is there too great diversity to enable any  conclusion to be. arrived at ? I think there      is a great diversity of opinion. It depends very much on their home conditions and      on their particular tastes.&quot;  (q. 102-105.)    Miss Constance  Smith gave her experience as follows  :            &quot; Have you found any factories in which it is really popular on its merits? Yes,      there is a certain number of them  where it  undoubtedly is popular.           &quot; You mean where  they would object to going back  to  the one-day  shift? Yes,      I was inclined to think  at first that it  was popular at factories  which were  largely      staffed by married women.  It is true that  married women in some cases do feel it is      a special advantage  to them.  But I found also  that there is a certain number of      factories where the staff  are made up almost solely  of single girls where it is popular      too.  The single girls say  they like it, especially where,  as in my area, there is  no      second shift on  a Saturday afternoon,  so that every other week  they  get  the  whole      Saturday off.           &quot;  You think that reconciles or moves even the  unmarried women in favour of the      system? Yes.   They set it off against the  lost  evenings of alternate weeks the fact      that they are going to get a Saturday entirely to themselves.&quot;  (q. 358-360.)
    Miss Esoreet considers that  on the whole a majority of the women in the Midlands areagainst the system,  (q. 275.)  Mr. H. J. Wilson, Superintending Inspector for the NorthernDivision, reports  that in Scotland the  women on  the  whole  prefer it  to a single-day shift.(q. 664.)  Throughout the enquiry we have found differences of opinion of which the above arefair illustrations.    Married women certainly appear to  think that they are  able to arrange their domesticwork to better advantage when working in shifts, and very much appreciate the opportunityafforded for shopping.  One witness pointed out to us  that she was able to  see more of herchild than when she was employed from 8 a.m. to  6 p.m. every day.    16.  Administration.-It  has been  suggested that under  the shift  system it will bedifficult for the Factory  Inspector to see  that women  and young persons are not employed for more than the legal number of hours, and that it  would  be impossible for them  to find out if any individual woman was employed on more than one shift in  the day.    The evidence of the Factory Inspectors does not bear out this suggestion.  Mr. Bellhouse,for instance, in answer to a question as to whether there would be any difficulty in this  respectsays:            &quot; No, I do not think there will be any.  That was one of the main objections      in pre-war times, when we considered the insertion of a clause in the Act of 1901,  but      I  think the whole condition of the employment of women has  altered now;  I think      they are much better able to take care of  themselves;  and certainly our experience      during the war period, and during the period  of  reconstruction, does not lend any       support to the theory that we should not be able  to administer an order.   We have had      no difficulty in doing  it up to  now.&quot;  (q.  47.)    It is further suggested that the ventilation and cleaning of the factories is likely to beless satisfactory when the premises are occupied for sixteen hours out  of twenty-four  insteadof eight.  Both these matters are covered by the provisions of the Factory Act and can in ouropinion be left to the supervision of the Factory Inspectors.    Another objection put  forward is that the system will result in a greater amount of work being done by  artificial light than is the  case with a single day shift.  This  is undoubtedly a fact and  must be reckoned as one of the disadvantages of the system.    17.  Provisions for Welfare  of Workers. The conditions  attached to the Orders issued bythe Home  Office  under their emergency powers have dealt with various matters affecting thecomfort  and welfare of the workers.  In  some cases in which the factory was in an isolatedposition  the firms have been required to provide conveyances for bringing the  workers to thefactory when they  are on  the early shift and taldng them home when they are on  the  lateshift.  In others, the firms have been required to alter the times of the  shifts in order to make them fit in with the local train service.  Where adequate transport facilities were not available,the permission to employ women on shifts has been limited to those who live in  the vicinity of the works.    Another set  of conditions have dealt with the provision of arrangements for obtainingfood at the factory.  In the majority of the  Orders issued the firms  have been required toprovide adequate facilities,for the women who remain on the premises during mealtimes toobtain meals at the works.    The times of working have been  so arranged that long spells of work  were, as far aspossible, avoided, and in many cases the firm were required to allow  a short break  of 10 or15 minutes in the middle of the morning or afternoon in addition to the regular meal interval.It was also arranged that a break should be given as soon as practicable after the 6 a.m. start.    Other conditions dealt with cloakroom and washing accommodation and in some caseswith supervision.     18.  Juvenile  Workers. We have given special attention to the question of employmentof young persons on the shift system.  Many of the witnesses who appeared before  us were of  opinion that  the employment of boys and girls between the ages of 14 and  16  on  thissystem was unnecessary and undesirable.  Very few  of the  firms who gave  evidence beforeus asked for it.  The great majority said that it would be sufficient if  permission were given to  employ women and  young persons over 16.  Dr. Legge  in particular emphasised  the necessity of boys and  girls between the ages of  14 and 16 going to  bed early and having sufficient sleep.  The educational difficulty to which  we have referred in a previous part of our report applies  particularly  in  the case of young  persons  of this age.   In  view of the evidence we have formed a clear opinion  that if permission at all is given for the introduction into our factory legislation of a  two-shift system that permission should not extend to  boys and girls under the age of  16.     There are a certain number of young persons between these  ages at present employed on this  system under the  Home Office  orders, under conditions which we understand to be satisfactory; and we do  not think in their case the permission which has adready been granted need be withdrawn in view of the difficulty which might be found at the present time of placing them in other  employment.
    Li the case of young persons over the age of 10 different considerations come into play,and no case  has been shown  for  discriminating, at an  rate at present,  between them and persons over  18, who are treated by the Factory Act as adults.    In connection with the questions of juvenile workers we may mention a question whichhas arisen with regard to employment of young persons in the  glass industry.  At  presentthe employment of young persons above the age of 14 on day and night shifts is allowed bythe Factory Act  in the case of the glass industry, Section 55.   The effect of the provisionsof Clause I of the Bill which was introduced by the Government to carry out the Conventionsof Washington would make it illegal in future to employ boys on the night shift between thehours of  10 p.m. and 5 a.m.   As there are no provisions in the Conventions which would interfere with the  employment of young  persons on the shift system during the day, we take it  that it would continue to be legal under the provisions of the Factory Act for the glasstrade  to  continue  their  present system  of shift  working during the day, irrespective of any powers being given by the Bill to authorise  the  two-shift system.    Hie two alterations, however, which were made in the Bill, viz., the omission of Clause 2and the alteration of the definition of  &quot;  night &quot; made the trade apprehensive that they wouldbe unable to continue the  system as at present worked.    Witnesses from  different  sections  of the  trade, including representatives both of theemployers and of  the Unions, and from the Joint Industrial Council of  the  trade appeared before us to give evidence.  They represented that the special conditions of the glass industry had always been recognised by Parliament, that the prohibition of night work for boys under16  which would result  from  the  adoption,  of the  Washington Conventions would by itselfcause serious dislocation in  the industry and entail a good deal of re-organisation, and thatif in addition  to this they were to be  prevented from employing boys on more than one shiftduring the day it would be extremely difficult for them in present circumstances to carry on.The case is set out in full in their evidence which is appended to this report and we need notelaborate it further here.    We  doubt whether the matter really comes within our terms of reference at all  in viewof the fact that the system is already allowed by the Factory Act and that the position willremain as it now is unless the Bill before Parliament alters it by forbidding the employmentof boys between 9 p.m.  and 6 a.m.*   We think it right, however, to express the opinion thata strong case was made  out by the representatives of the trade, both workers and employers,for the temporary continuation of the employment of boys between the  ages of 14  and 16,between 6 a.m. and 10 p.in.    It would be desirable, however, to secure that  the power of the Secretary of  State to attach conditions should apply in this case  as in the  other cases  of employment on the day-shift system, and we also think that  the question of the need to continue the system shouldbe reviewed later  on.    19.  It has been suggested that the  proposal to employ women and young persons on a two-shift system is inconsistent with the  spirit of the Conventions adopted by the InternationalLabour  Conference at Washington.   This criticism appears to be unfounded.  The Washing-ton Conference adopted two Conventions dealing with the employment of women and  youngpersons  at night.  Both  of these prohibited the employment  of  women and young personsbetween the hours of 10 p.m. and 5  a.m.,  but there is nothing in the Conventions which is inconsistent in any way with employment on a two-shift system during the day.   On  the con-trary, it was recognised in  the Debates  on  the  Conventions that employment on  a two-shift system during the day was admissible.  On both Conventions  proposals  were discussed to substitute for the period 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.  either the period 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. or 11 p.m. to5 a.m. for the purpose of enabling a system of two shifts of eight hours each, with an hour&apos;sinterval  in the course of a shift, to be worked during the day. These proposals were not carriedbut not on the ground that the two-shift system in itself was undesirable, and there was nothing in  the Debates  to  suggest that there  was any  body of objection  to  a two-shift systembetween the limits laid down by the  Convention.   In fact the  Italian Labour Delegate said :&quot; As a matter of principle I am not  opposed to the system of shift working;  on the  contraryI see in the system of  working by shifts the possibility of reducing the hours of  labourwithout  interfering  with production by means of working  in  two shifts.&quot;     20.   Conclusions. We have carefully considered the evidence before us.     We recognise that the experience of the system is limited,  and that the whole  question has not yet  passed  out  of the experimental  stage.   *  We are, however, of the  opinion that a case has been made out  for allowing, under conditions,  the adoption of the shift system in continuous industries,  seasonal trades and in factories in  which the plant  and premises  are temporarily insufficient.     We are  further of the opinion that it is in the  national interest,  subject to  proper safeguards  and supervision, that an opportunity  for trying the system should be  given to    * We are not clear what is the effect of the alteration in the definition of night which was made in CommitteeClause 1 of the Bill prohibits the employment of women and young persons at night except, to the extent to whichit is permitted by the Conventions, and the Conventions contain their own definition of night which would not we think be altered by the amendment in the Bill itself and which there is apparently no power to alter.
12th November, 1920.those employers  and trade union organisations who desire  to introduce it  as a regular  partof their  industrial system for the  purpose of increasing  production.  We do  not  think,however, that the experience of the system  so  far obtained  is  sufficient  to enable us torecommend its incorporation as a permanent  part of  our factory legislation.  In our view,it should be regarded as an experiment and further inquiry should be made after a certainperiod into the working and effects of the system.-  We accordingly suggest that if sanctionis given hi the Bill to the adoption  of the system it should be for a limited period of,  say,five  years.  At the end of that period Parliament would then be free to  review the wholequestion  and decide whether the system should  be continued  for  a further period or abandoned.Further, we recommend that  the Home Office should retain the power which it exercises atpresent  of  deciding in what cases the adoption of the  system should he allowed, and  thatfor this purpose, the adoption of the system in any works  should be dependent  on the issueof a Home Office Order and subject to such conditions  to secure  the welfare of the workers as may be attached to the Order.  These Orders would be liable to be withdrawn in the caseof any abuse.     We  do not  recommend any  alteration in  the hours proposed in  the Government Bill 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.   The reduction of  the period of employment to less than  eight hours would in most  cases prevent  the adoption of the system  while  it  would not  remove thechief objections to the scheme which are the weekly turnover of shifts and the evening workin alternate periods.  We think the objections to the  hours proposed have been exaggeratedand the  Home Office will be able by the conditions it attaches to its  Orders to safeguard theinterests of the  workers.     21.  Recommendations. We therefore recommend that :       1. The Secretary of State should be given  power to make Orders allowing the employ -             ment of women and young persons of 16  years of age and over on a system of             two day-shifts of not more than eight hours average duration between the hours             of  6 a.in. and 10 p.m. from Monday to Friday,  and  6 a.m. and .2 p.m. on             Saturday.   These Orders should, we think, be granted for individual factories,             or  for a class or group of factories,  subject to such conditions as  the Secretary             of  State may consider necessary to safeguard the  welfare and interests of the             workers. The Orders should be expressed to be liable to withdrawal in the             event of non-compliance with the conditions or of any abuse arising but  subject             to  this should be regarded  as intended to  be  effective for the period hereinafter .             mentioned.       2. The power to make  Orders should not  extend to young persons under 16 years of             age but we are of the opinion  that an  exception should be allowed for  those             young persons under  16 who are at the present  time employed on the shift             system, so long as they remain in their  present employment.       3. The power to make the Orders should be given for a limited period of  five years in             the  first instance  and at  the  end of,  say, four  years,  inquiry should  be             made into the whole question in the light  of the. additional experience gained.       4. The power of the Home  Office  to impose conditions should be made to extend to             the  employment  of boys  in the glass trade under the powers  conferred by             Section 55.      Our Secretary,  Miss Isabel Taylor, has helped us in every possible way.  Her experience  has  been most  valuable, both in obtaining the proper  evidence and in framing  the terms of  our report.

F.  H. DURHAM,                                                       F.  W. MALLALIEU,                                                       JULIA VARLEY.    F. ISABEL  TAYLOR,          Secretary.
