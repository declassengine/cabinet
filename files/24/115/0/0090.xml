Circulated for Information.(Previous Papers:  Nos. B.E.D. 9, 10, 23, 32, 33, 34; C.P.-1902, 1905,  1956, 1962,                            1974, 2010, and 2188.)                  (a.) Introductory Note by the Secretariat.    THE resolutions of the Council of the League of Nations taken at its meeting at brussels, the 20th to 27th October,  concerning the scheme for the establishment ofa Permanent Court of International Justice prepared by the Advisory Committee ofJurists at The  Hague, all take the form of carefully worded amendments to thescheme with one exception: the Secretariat has been instructed to bring the provisionsof the scheme not amended by the Council into harmony with the amended parts.    For this reason,  it seems preferable to  present the  resolutions  of the Councilconcerning  the draft  scheme in the  form of  a new scheme, in which the differences between the old  and the new wording have been  clearly brought out.    It should be  noted that  when the  Council voted the new text of Article 37M. Bourgeois abstained from  voting.    On the other hand, the resolution of the Council of the  League on the vceuxsubmitted by The Hague Committee is embodied in the report on the matter presented by M. Caclamanos.  Special attention should be given to the additional voeu proposedby M. Caclamanos.    For the above reasons, the resolutions of the Council concerning the PermanentCourt of International Justice are below printed as follows:     (a.) The scheme of the Advisory Committee, with amendments adopted by the          Council and the modifications which in the opinion of the  Secretariat          were made necessary by these amendments.    (6.) A  simple reference to the report of M.  Caclamanos on the question of the        ;  vceux submitted by The Hague Committee, with the text of the vceux and          of this additional voeu.(b.) Draft  Scheme for the Institution  of the  Permanent  Court  of International      Justice, mentioned in Article 14  of the Covenant of the League  of Nations,      presented to the Council of the League by the Advisory Committee of Jurists      as amended by the  Council.

The proceedings  for  revision will be opened by a  judgment of  the Courtexpressly recording  the existence of  the new fact,  recognising that it has such a character as to lay the case open to revision, and declaring the application admissibleon this ground.
\    The Court may require previous compliance with the  terms of the  judgmentbefore it admits proceedings in revision.    No application for revision  may be made after the lapse of five years from thedate of the sentence.                                 ARTICLE 60.    Should a State consider that it lias an interest of a legal nature which may beaffected by the decision in  the case, it may  submit a request to  the Court to be permitted to intervene as a third party.    It will be for the Court to decide upon this request.                                 ARTICLE 61.    Whenever the  construction  of a convention in which States other than those concerned in  the case are parties  is in question, the Registrar shall notify  all suchStates forthwith.    Every State so notified has  the right to  intervene in the proceedings; but if ituses this right, the construction  given by the judgment will be as binding  upon it asupon  the original parties to the dispute.                                  ARTICLE 62.    Unless otherwise decided by the Court, each party shall bear its own costs.                                (c.) Resolutions.

The Advisory  Committee of Jurists, assembled  at The Hague, to prepare theconstituent Statute of a Permanent Court of  International  Justice;     Convinced that  the extension of the way of  Justice  and the development ofInternational Jurisdiction are urgently required to ensure the security of  States and well-being of the Nations;    Recommend that:      1.  A new inter-State Conference to carry on the work of the two Pirst Confer-ences at The Hague, should be called as soon as possible for  the purpose of      (1.) Re-establishing the existing rules of the  Law of Nations, more especially           and in the first place, those affected by the events of the recent war;     (2.) Formulating  and approving the modifications and additions rendered           necessary or advisable by the war; and by the changes in the conditions           of international life  following upon this great struggle;     (3.) Reconciling divergent opinions  and bringing about a general understanding           concerning the rules  which have been the subject of controversy-,     (4.) Giving special consideration to those  points which are not at the present         ,  time adequately provided for, and which a definite settlement by general           agreement is required in the interests of international justice.     2.  That the Institute of International Law, the American Institute of Interna- tional Law, the Union juridique internationale, the International Law Association and the Iberian Institute of Comparative Law should be invited to adopt any method, or use any system of collaboration, that they may think fit, with a view to the prepara- tion of draft plans to be submitted, first to the various Governments, and then to the Conference, for the realisation  of this work.     3. That the new Conference should be called  the  Conference for  the Advance- ment of Internationa] Law.     4. That  this  Conference should be  followed by periodical similar Conferences, at intervals sufficiently short to  enable the work undertaken to be continued in so far as it may  be incomplete, with every prospect  of success.                                * B.E.D.  Paper No. 33.
                              Second Resolution.    The Advisory Committee of  Jurists assembled at The Hague to prepare theconstituent Statute of a Permanent Court of International Justice:    Having had laid before it by its President a proposition for. the establishmentfor the future of a High Court of International Justice;    Recognising the high  importance of this proposition;    Recommends  it to the consideration of the Council  and the Assembly of theLeague of Nations.

The Advisory Committee of  Jurists assembled at The Hague to prepare theconstituent Statute of a Permanent Court of International Justice;    Gladly takes this opportunity of  recording a unanimous wish that the Academyof International Law, founded at The Hague in 1913, and of which the work hasbeen suspended owing to circumstances, may be set in operation in as near a future as possible, side by side  with the Permanent Court of International Justice and thePermanent Court of Arbitration,  at the Palace of Peace at  The Hague.                            Additional Resolution.    The League of Nations recommends that the Conference for the advancement of International Law, if summoned, should be instructed to consider and to formulatethe conditions under which the Permanent Court of International Justice may begiven jurisdiction (and  that without  any special Convention giving it jurisdiction),in cases other than those where by virtue of Treaties in force this Court has jurisdic-tion without special agreement between the parties.o
