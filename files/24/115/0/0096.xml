Unemployment appears to be still  on the increase in nearly all parts of thecountry.  Trade depression continues.   No improvement is anticipated before nextyear either in cotton or woollen industries.   Large stocks of manufactured goodsremain  unsold owing to high prices and difficulties of continental trade.   Severaldivisions report that serious loss is being experienced in the ship-repairing industryowing to the diversion of repair work to Antwerp and other continental ports. It isstated that continental firms are able to quote lower prices and to give definite datesfor completion of contracts.  The jute and linen industries in Scotland  are veryslack, and the position  is unchanged in the leather, boot and shoe, and clothingindustries generally.                         II.
