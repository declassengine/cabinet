With regard to the obligations  contained in  subhead(a) of the third paragraph of the  Agreement the BritishGovernment desires to bring to the immediate  attention ofthe Soviet Government the fallowing  matters.                         I         The British Government have information(1) that a Bolshevik Islamic Treaty  was  concluded at moscow in May 1920, between Messrs Lenin,  Chicherin andother Russian Commissars, on the one hand,  and representativesof Mustapha Kemal and other Revolutionary bodies  in the Easton the other.  In this Agreement,  which  was published in the&quot;Pravda&quot; of June 29th, the Russians  promised  to provideofficers, troops, arms and money to  the  Turkish nationalist forces, who undertook &quot;inter alia&quot; to drive the British outof Persia, to put no hindrance in the way of  Bolshevik propaganda, and to encourage and assist  the National  Movementin India in every way.     (2) that money, military supplies,  and troops havebeen sent by the Soviet Government to Jlustapha Kemal  atAngora, and that a Soviet Delegation headed by Eliava has only recently been negotiating with him there.     (3) that a Nationalist Assembly was held at  Angora  inJuly 1920, attended by Soviet delegates, at which thePresident, Mustapha Kemal Pasha, made a speech in thecourse  of which he said.     &quot;We ha-tfe sought out the Bolsheviks; we have  exchangedofficial correspondence with the Soviet Government, thetenour  of which you know, and the Soviet Government has promised us all manner of material help, arms, gunsand money.  Of late, the conflicts which arose in theCaucasus prevented the arrival of this help.   We are onthe point of eliminating such obstacles&quot;; and that onAugust  5th he issued a Proclamation announcing the alliance and assistance of the  Bolsheviks.     It is plain that these  activities are entirelyinconsistant with the provisions of the agreement, andthe British  Government desires to be  assured that thearrangements made with Mustapha Kemal will be cancelledas soon as the Trade agreement is signed and that noproceedings  of a kind  similar to those mentioned abovev*&apos;ai be  permitted by the  Soviet Government.
     In spite of assurances by the Soviet Government that itsforces whioh are now in Persia would be immediatelywithdraw, they still remain and the Persian coast of the caspian is still in their armed occupation.   The efforts made by successive Persian delegates to procure their withdrawal by negotiation with the Soviet Government ofAzerbaijan, by whom they had been ostensibly despatched,have uniformly failed, because the Azerbaijan Governmenthas Invariably represented that the Russian SovietGovernment would not consent to evacuation, and that thematter must be sottled at Moscow,     It is clear that in the last re-sort the responsibilityfor the attacks made upon Persia rests with the SovietGovernment.     His Majsstyrs Government; who have special relations with Persia and the Persian Government, desire to point eut thatthese actions alst are wholly inconsistent with the undertakingsnow given by the Soviet Government in concluding the trade agreement and thoy call upon the lattor to withdraw allRussian forces and to desist from all propaganda in Persia.                    XXI *     The attention of His Majcsty!s Government has been called to the following cases of Soviet propaganda or hostile actionagainst British interests in Afghanistan, from all of whichthey expect tho Soviet Government, in fulfilling th*assurances which havo been accepted as a fundamentalcondition of the Trade Agreement, immediately to desist.     (1) Completion of the Secret Treaty recently concludedbetween Soviet emissaries and the Amir of Afghanistan, thopurport of whioh is known to His MajestyJs Government.     (2) Appointment of Soviet Consuls in towns anddistricts in proximity to the Indian frontier, as provided forin the above Treaty.     (3) Grant of a money subsidy to the Amir, as provided forin the same Treaty.     (4) Traffic in arms or munitions cither independently or through the Afghan Government, with the&apos;tribes on the Indianfrontier, as provided for in the same Treaty.     (5) Institution of instructional centres or bases whether at Moscow, Taskend, Kabul or elsewhere, designed to spreadBolshevik propaganda in India, and tho countries bordering onthe Indian Umpire.     (.6) Despatch of revolutionary agents to the above-namedcountries and conduct of revolutionary propaganda there.H 2 &quot;
5L*     The attention of Eis Ma;jesty*s Governmenthas &quot;been further directed to instructions given&quot;by the&apos;Scviet Government to the Soviet agentSuritz,  with regard to propaganda in India ana tcother plans for the Conduct of revolutionarypropaganda in India.     These activities as well as the employmentof Indian revolutionaries&apos;anc the export of. anti-British literature from Russia to India, arc clearlyprecluded hy tho&apos;provisions of the Agreement nowcntored into botwoon His Majesty&apos;s Government an  thoSoviot Government, and His l/u^estyTs Governmentassumes that thoy will immediately cease in. ordorthat tho good faith of the agreement may he observed.November 26th, 1920*
