ROADS BILL.          Memorandum  by the Minister of Tronsport covering Drift Bill.     I submit a Bill which has for its main object  theestablishment of the necessary administrative arrangementsfor the collection of the taxes on Motor Cars imposed bySection 13 of the Finance Act 1920.     During the debates on tho Budget Resolutions and theFinance Bill, it was made clear that all money produced bythe taxes to be Imposed on motor vehicles would be  appliedtowards improvement and development of roads.     The Bill  provides for the levying and oolloction  of thenew taxes by County Councils, and, following tho precedent of the Finance Act, 1908, it is proposed that the details ofthe administrative arrangements should be laid down by  Orderin Council.     The proceeds of the taxes are to be paid into  theExchequer and subject to payment     (a) of the assigned revenues now payable into  the  local          taxation accounts for England and Scotland;     (b) of the oxpensos of the County Councils of  levying          and collection;     (c) of the Police fees for licensing vehicles  as stage          and hackney carriages on the present basis;     (d) of a proportion of the expenses of the Roads          Department of the Ministry of Transport;  and     (e) of any expenses which may be incurred by other          Government Departments, eg.., the Post&apos;Office          in administering the Actare to be paid out of the credit of the Road Fund establishedby the Bill.                                              This                              (1)             --IiSECRET.  CP.  2122.
     This fund is to supersede that set up by the Development  andRood Improvement Fund Act 1909, and moneys to the credit of  theRoad Improvement Grant under that Act are to be transferred.     The Road Fund is to be applied under my direction to thepurposes of the last-mentioned Act as extended by the Bill.  TheAct Is limited to the following objects     (a)   to make advances to County Councils and other highway           authorities in respect of the construction of new           roads and the Improvement of existing roads.     (b)   to construct and maintain new roads.     As now framed the Bill proposes to extend the first of these objects to the making of advances to any authority, company or person in respect of the construction of new roads or the maintenanceor improvement of existing roads.     The important differences are the powers to contribute:-          (i)  to maintenance of highways; end          (ii)  towards improvements etc., effected in roads for               which the highuay authority is not responsible               e.g., bridges over railways and canals with  their               Immediate approaches.     The desirability of securing improvement in tha portions,not now subject to the  control of the Highway Authority, ofsuch roads as form part of important highways is manifest but,at the same time the Treasury  suggest and I  concur In  thesuggestion that  the Road Fund  should not be  made applicable                                               tto these cases unless a contribution is also forthcoming fromthe Highway Authority.   An amendment will be required in theBill as now submitted to give  effect to this limitation.     The remainder of the Bill is devoted to provisions  forsecuring uniformity and economy  in  and  the  simplification ofthe existing  procedure  regarding  licensing  and registration of                                             motor                      (8)
motor vehicles.     Under the present, law, registration of motor car sand payment of excise duties are separated, and theprovisions as regards the former are such that existingregisters are no real criterion of the number and types of vehicles actually in use.     The Bill is designed to combine the present systems of registration and of lloenstog in one process and tomake the particulars given by tho owner of a motor caron his application for a licence form)the registrationparticulars *     In practice the owner will fill "to  one form andsend it with the amount of the dty to the County council who will then issue a licence and register the car inaccordance with the particulars given.     In the past the licence has been a personal licencenot transferable and enabling the holder to keep any typeof vehicle of a taxable capacity not great er than thatin respect of which ho has taken a licence.     It Is now suggested that the licence bo applicableonly to the vehicle in respect of which it is issued and betransferable with that vehicle;  that the licence should beaffixed to and exhibited upon the vehicle and that the ownershould be provided, in addition, with a registration bookwhich would not bo carried on the vehicle.     This system will securo that no vehicles for which dutyhas not been paid are  used upon the roads and will make it                                              difficult
difficult for the traffic in stolen motor oars to continue.     It will be at onoe apparent, under the system proposed, whetheror not a&apos;vehicle has paid duty, for it will carry in a conspicuousposition a tablet which will only be issued on payment of duty orin respect of a vehicle cxompt from duty, i.e*, Crown vehicles. a vehicle without this tablet will be liable to be stopped by thePolice and the necessary proceedings instituted.     If a motor car bo at olen, the owner would notify the police and tho person found driving the car carrying tho particular licencewould be unable to account for the registration book which would beIn possession of the real owner of the car.     If the car had been altered or the number plates changed thesealterations BeaUd be at once apparent upon reference to the tabletcarried on the car*     The advantages of the scheme are:-         (1)  Economy and simplicity of administration.         (2)  Security for the payment of duties of licence.         (3)  prevention of traffic in stolon cars.       An additional advantage will be gained in that the registers of vehicles/ will be a proper record of the number and location ofthe vehiotyes actually in use in the country, and, should it benecessary for any purpose of national emergency to make a call upon them, ti/ia machinery for doing so is at once available.G)he following is a precis of the provisions of the Bill:.-                                              Clauses,                     (4)                             &apos;
                                                               - - -iI -       Clauses  1, 2, and 3 of the Bill give effect to the scheme forI  levying and  collection of licence duties?  for establishment  of and  payments  into  and  out of the fcoad Fund;  and the administration and  accountancy  of the Fund.       Clause 4 enacts amendments already referred to in the  Development  and Road Improvement Fund Act 1909 which are setvout in  the Schedule.       Clause 5 provides the machinery for applications for and delivery  of particulars in  connection with the issue of the licence;   for the  licence being  issued in respect of the particular vehicle;  for  surrender of old and Issue of  new licences when circumstances so  require and  requires the licence tablet to be carried on the  vehicle.       Clause 6 provides for registers being compiled by the County  Council from the particulars supplied in the application for  the  licence and  re-enacts in reference to the new conditions thej  provisions of  the  Motor Car Acts with respect to identification  numbers.       Clause 7 (1) aoplles the relative provisions of the Motor Car  Acts  (which  refer  to &quot;Motor Cars&quot;) to &quot;vehicles&quot; as defined in the  Bill.       Clause 7 (2) enables provision to be made for limiting  the speed.  of agricultural tractors a class  of  motor vehicles not now adequately  dealt with in  the  Motor Car Acts.       Clause 7 (3) defines &quot;unladen  weight&quot; which  is the basis laid  down  in the  Finance Act 1920 for  taxation  of Commercial vehicles.L     Clause 7 (4) provides  for payment  of  proceeds  of  issue  of  drivers  licences  and penalties recovered  under  the  Motor Car Acts  to  the Road  Fund  instead of, ab at present, to the  County Councils.                                                               *
    Clause 8 makes certain verbal amendments in the finance act 1920.   Subsection (2) is explanatory of the expressionin that Act as to a vehicle being &quot;used solely for conveyance of goods&quot;.   Subsection (?) deals with the case where a vehicle,for which a licence at a lower rate of duty has been taken, is used for purposes which would render it liable to a higher rate.    Clause 9 deals with the case of vehicles in the hands of manufacturers and dealers.   It is a concession from the fullduty chargeable under the Finance Act and enables a manufactureror dealer to obtain a licence or licences under which he canuse on the roads any vehicle In his possession for purposesof testing and other trade purposes, provided that he does not use at any one time any vehicles in excess of the number of licences which he has taken out.    Clause 10 enables the Minister in view of the increased taxation now imposed to revise any charges by way of mileagepayment which have been imposed either by private Act or byagreement upon vehicles of the Omnibus type in respect of theuse of roads.    Clause 11 deals with the case of the vehicle which is used as a hackney carriage, but which is not licenced to ply forhire.   It provides for distinctive marks being carried and, asthe tax in this case  is in reference to seating capacity,imposes penalties for using a vehicle taxed on a lower seatingcapacity being used to convey a larger number of passengers.    Clause 12 specifies the subject matters in regard to whichthe Minister may make regulations.    Clause 13 imposes penalties for breaches  of the Finance  Act1920 and  of the Bill.
     Clause 14 makes provision for the new taxes being in substitution for all other fees and charges.     Clause 15 extends the maximum weight of heavylocomotives, e.g., steam rollers, used on roads from 14 tons to 20 tons.     The remaining Clauses are incidental.                o                                  (Signed) Eric Geddes.20th November 1920.                       ADDENDUM.     Amendments are required in Clauses 1 (4) and 12 (h) ofthe Bill.   It Is hoped to circulate at or before the Meetingan agreed form of amendments to these Glauses and a form of amendment to provide for the alteration agreed with theTreasury to which reference is made in page 2 of thisMemorandum.(7)
