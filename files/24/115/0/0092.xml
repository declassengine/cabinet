O.P.  2191   UPOSITION OF TI-IE DYE-MARIIM INDUSTRY,           MEMORANDUM BY              THg PRxi,SIDbNT OP THg BQ,vHD OF TRADE;   (Note:  A alight  drafting amendment will  he  necessary .;t         the end of  Clause   in the attached  (trait bill.)     I have recently received urgent representations asto the necessity of immediate action to safeguard theDye-Making Industry against the revived and rapidly increas-ing competition from Germany,  and it has been impressed upon me&quot;that it is most desirable that such action shouldbe taken separately and without waiting for the more generalmeasure as to key industries which is intended to be introducedearly next Session.     It is hardly necessary for me to remind my colleagues that the Dye-Making Industry is the chief example of thegroup of key industries which were almost entirely controlled by Germany before the war;  and that its maintenance anddevelopment here are essential not only for the security ofour great dye-using trades (especially textiles) but also for the supply of munitions for chemical warfare, since, as germany showed, dye-making works can be rapidly adapted forthat purpose.  &apos;It is also very important as providing theonly large commercial field for the training and employmentof organic chemists, a class of scientific workers whosesignificance we had not as a Nation adequately realised,with the consequent shortage which was a source of very real difficulty during the war.   It was the recognition ofthis very special character of the Dye-Making industry which led the Government to subscribe largely to the capital of the British Dyestuffs Corporation, Limited (by far themost important dye-making enterprise, which was establishedlargely at the instigation of the Government, and in which theGovernment hold 850,000 Preference Shares of  1 each, and850,000 Ordinary Shares Of  1 each), and also to make grants and loans to other dye-making Companies (in three cases sofar).     The urgency of the situation is due to the fact thatthe activities of the great German dye-making concerns, whichuntil about the middle of this year were on a very 15mitedscale, are now reviving rapidly and there is evidence thatthose concerns are making every possible effort to recovertheir hold upon the British market and to retard as much aspossible, if they cannot entirely prevent, the developmentof the British industry.   Large offers of dyestuffs arebeing made from Germany and substantial importations havealready taken place;  and these facts, combined with thedepression in the dye-using industries, have placed the dye--.-makers, and particularly the British Dyestuffs Corporation,in a position of grave financial embarrassment, with the resultthat not only is it necessary to delay the programme ofdevelopment, but staffs..and output are being reduced.
      In this connection it is important for my colleagues to bear in mind that the intention of His Majesty1s Governmentto safeguard the Dye-Making Industry has been the subject ofrepeated publio declarations and that my predecessor at theBoard of Trade, Sir Albert Stanley, announced in the House ofCommons as long ago as the 15th May,  1918, that it was theintention of the Government to prohibit the importation of dye-stuffs, except under licence,  for a period of 10 years.   that statement was set out, with the approval of the Government, inthe Prospectus of the British Dyestuffs Corporation issued onthe 18th July, 1919, and there is no question but that thestatement, combined with the fact that the Government had taken a large financial interest and had two nominees upon the Boardof Directors, was a powerful inducement to many persons tosubsoribe.   (-The subscribed capital of the British dyestuffs corporation is  4,119,000 in Preference Shares,  4,090,000 inPreferred Ordinary Shares, and  993,000 in Deferred ordinary shares, these figures including the Government holdings).     In addition to the representations of the dye makers thatif the present unrestricted importations bo allowed to continue for some months (as they must  be without immediate legislation)the whole future of the industry will be imperilled, and thatin the particular  case of the British Dyestuffs corporation the financial position would be very serious if not disastrous.There are also threatened  the resignations of certain membersof the Board owing to the delay of the Government in fulfillingtheir pledge.   It has also beon urged upon me by the repre-sentatives of the dye users that the  present state of uncertaintyseriously embarrasses  henTin the conduct of their business.     Whilst for these reasons  immediate legislation isdesirable, there are certain practical considerations whioh tellin the same direction.    The Key Industries Bill to be intro-duced next Session will, as at present proposed, containsprovisions fer imposing an ad  valorem  oharge on all keyindustry products imported under licence, tho object being toavoid the imputation that holders of licences v/ill be placedin a favoured position&apos;as regards tho price they have to pay for their supplies in comparison with those to whom for one reason and another licenses have to be refused.   Such a pro-vision would also facilitate licensing since the existence ofsuch a charge might in regard  to some descriptions of articlesof itself afford an adequate safeguard.   But it has been made clear to me ttut if any such &apos; Gharge  is proposed in the caseof dyestuffs, strong opposition must  be expected from the textile users of dyes, and that if it were enforced weshould have very considerable  difficulty in securing theco-operation of those users, not merely in the administrationof the Act, but in attaining the general result whioh We
have in view. viz,, the most expeditious development of theDye-Making Industry,  On the other hand, if no such oharge be levied, I am satisfied that the main body of consumers  reprepared to aocopt the policy of  prohibition of importation,except unier licence, and to assist in working it with theleast possible friction, and in other ways to sive aotiveoo-operatj oiio  It would clearly, however, be very difficultto differentiate in this respect between the Dye-MakingIndustry and other key industries in one ana the same Bill,and a separate measure in respect of dyos presents therefore a distinct advantage.    It would also be possible to make the regime to be applied to other key industries of shorter durationthan that. appli e d to d yes.     I have accordingly caused a Bill to be drafted which is annexed to this Memorandum.-   It is very short and providessimply that the prohibition of the importation of dyestuffs,colours and colouring matters and intermediate products for themanufacture thereof shall be prohibited for a period of 10years, subject to licences to be issues by the Board of trade on the advice of ? Committee, the constitution of which isset out in Clause 2.  On this question of the constitutionof the Committee I have had prolonged discussions with represents-tives of the dye makers and other chemical industries concerned and of the dye users, and I am assured that the constitutionproposed in the draft Bill will be acceptable to both parties.      Mist I believe that a measure on the lines proposedwill command very general support, I fear that it cannot beregarded as an unopposed Bill,since there is certain to be some opposition from a -particular section of the Textile Trade,a-oart from such opposition as there may be 011 more general political grounds,  Nevertheless, in view of the very realurgency of&quot; the matter it is in my judgment of paramount importance that efforts should be made to carry a measure ofthe kind through during the present berjsion.29.11,20.
